{"text":"I went here for lunch one day, and it is excellent! I had a chicken bowl, and the chicken was sooo wonderful and flavorful. The service was good over the noon hour, and the decor and vibe was nice. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Can I give six stars?  Happy hour till 7 Great atmosphere Great staff Vegetarian options Food is really good! Even if I didn't want to drink I would come just to eat. Best churro on the planet... THE PLANET! Outside seating Best part is when there is a concert they pipe the music into the lounge area. So basically you can have a drink in the bar, talk to your friends and still listen to live music!"}
{"text":"First of all, I want to establish that I love the fact that this venue now exists and I think it's got great ideas overall. The lineup has been phenomenal and non-stop so far and the location is great. I plan on seeing Phantogram as my third show there so far.  I must also establish, though, that being under 21 at this venue absolutely sucks. First, you're sent to a back entrance after you get your ticket validated at the front entrance where you see people eating great food and having a great time outside. Upon entering through the back, you have three choices: go straight into the Kiddie Corral that makes up 1/4 of the whole crowd area, hang out in the dark bathroom, or check out the merch table. When I saw St. Vincent at Crescent Ballroom, I literally stood in the same spot for 30 minutes just so I could get a decent view of Annie. I couldn't move because it was so crowded and if I did move, the only view I would be able to get would've been the back of the drummer's head. Also, where I was standing, the sound was really distorted since the speakers were right above and in front of us. Everyone was wincing and plugging one of their ears to bear it; It was way too loud at least in that instance. I saw Unknown Mortal Orchestra there a few weeks prior, though, and that sounded pretty great...but the crowd was a lot smaller and thus I wasn't stuck directly in the speaker's line of fire.  I asked the two security guards at the back entrance 1. What do I do if I want something to drink other than water? and 2. What do I do if I want to get something to eat? To both questions, they answered, \"Just flag one of us security guards down, we'll take care of you.\" What, so I'm going to tell you I want something, you're going to leave your post to get me a menu, wait for me to choose, give my order to the kitchen, and then bring my food to me so I can eat it standing up in the corner of the Kiddie Corral? I don't think that's very logical, personally.  I just don't understand the logic of the whole map of the place. If you're 21, I would imagine it's a fantastic experience, but I wouldn't know since I'm 18 and not allowed to see more than the upper left corner of the building. Oh, and there's no re-entry even though you're stamped and usually braceleted! It's almost unbearable when the whole place is unceasingly loud and dark and stuffed with people and there is only a corner of available space to merely move in. I pay a good amount to get in to this nice local venue, I would expect to simply be able to get back in if I want to get a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Well this review is not about the music... Nor the food... Or anything you would expect in a review.   This is to document an outrage that transpired last night shortly after an art event to kickoff Art Detour showcasing local Latin Artists at this establishment.   The outrage was not from any of the patrons but from two specific employees.  First, one of the bouncers and then the second from the manager.  I can unequivocally state that this has been the most distasteful, disrespectful, and rude behavior my wife and I have experienced in our lives.  It started when the art event concluded... Which my wife was one of the principal organizers.  As the change over began for normal business, my wife and I decided to stay and experience the venue and enjoy the company of the various artists and supporters.  Well... At a certain point, one of the bouncers approached us asked if I had a wrist band.  We identified who we were... This is when the rude and disrepectful behavior began.  We were then asked to leave and escorted out because we did not have the right wrist band.  We all encounter rude behavior at some point in our lives.  We asked him to verify with the principal organizer and his management.  But where both my wife and I lost it is when we were told by the bouncer that we we singled out because we were speaking Spanish!  REALLY?!    Well... Needless to say, I will NEVER  step foot again In this establishment. And yes, I will make the statement that we were racially profiled.   Never thought I would ever have those words come out of my mouth even in Arizona.  All the reteric about Arizona showed it ugly head at this establishment.   What then made matters worse... The manager got involved. Publically being singled out because we spoke Spanish...  And then having a manager not even be willing to acknowledge the wrong doing of one of her employees.  Not even a simple apology.  UNACCEPTABLE AND WRONG,   As a Latino in Arizona who contributes to the community and cherishes our diversity...  I cannot be accepting of this type of behavior nor should any other self-respecting human being."}
{"text":"I really really like this spot, it reminds me of some hipster and cool spots throughout Brooklyn, NYC.  It is a cool live music venue meets Mexican restaurant.  The beers are tap are delicious and cheap in price.  I saw a very very good local band play during my first visit and the DJ in the front room always plays hot and upbeat music.  I love the crowd, the drinks, the music, and the vibe!!"}
{"text":"awesome place , its crescent thats all that needs to be said..everyone needs to go there at least once , food , music , drinks with great atmosphere what else could you ask for"}
{"text":"I want SO badly to give Crescent Ballroom a 5-star review, because really it is nearly a 5-star place.  First off, the concert venue is perfect for Phoenix.  It is small enough to be extremely intimate, yet large enough that you don't feel cramped and can step away almost enough to have a conversation while the music is loud.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are 2 bars that generally don't have a huge wait.  Did you say you could buy a burrito to eat during the concert? Heck yes!  The sound quality and lighting are both pretty good, and they bring in great local acts.  I think they have a concert nearly every night of the week, and tickets are rarely expensive.  Second, the lounge area is pretty awesome.  There is never a cover to get in, and you can generally hear the concerts from there as well.  Most nights there is a DJ that plays some pretty sweet music, and people seem to always be happy.  There are a number of high-tops and tables if you want to chill, and by midnight people tend to create a little dance floor.  I don't have much experience with the food here, but the burrito I had was pretty good and I've heard good things.  Check that out for yourself.  So, why only 3 stars?  The big reason is the smoking.  Crescent has a sizable patio area in the front of the building, and it draws quite the hipster crowd.  I love hipsters.  But I hate hate hate how much they smoke.  Every single person on the patio is smoking at all times.  The problem here?  The patio has giant doors that open the lounge up to the outside, and the hipsters are essentially smoking inside.  Not in 2012, not in my book.  It kills me.  Reason number two for the star-deduction: what is wrong with the grapefruit juice here?  I've been told by every bartender that it's fresh-squeezed, and I have no reason to doubt that.  But seriously, there is something major wrong with it.  I've tried it with all of my favorite vodkas, and it just fails each time.  So, here's what you do.  Drop by one night, they're open until 2am every night.  Check out a concert if you can, for $10 who really cares if you know them or not.  Grab a drink at the bar and stay as far from the patio as you can.  And grab an Odell IPA, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I must say that customer service is not a priority for the manager or their staff. After making the bartender aware that the person in front of me cut in line, I proceeded to give her my order. As soon as I broke eye contact with her to let my friend next to me know she was ready to take her order, the bartender rudely stopped serving me and took the order from the person who cut in front of me. I clearly brought to her attention that I was giving her my order when she stopped giving me her attention and boldly took the order of the person who cut in line. The bartender told me I was not giving her my order fast enough so she just took the next order in the middle of my own. I decided to talk to the manager about how rude her bartender was to me and my friend. She told me she could do nothing about what happened. She told me that they are very busy and her staff has to move fast. I let her know that I would at the very least like an apology from the bartender. She told me she can't do that because she can't \"Mother\" her and make her apologize. Eventually she offered to have the bartender talk with me. I again let the bartender know that as a former bartender myself, good customer service is essential for your business. This bartender had been taking my friends drink order all night long. For her to say that I was taking too long to order does not justify her behavior. When I served customers all night long, I pretty much knew their drink preference. I was very clear with my message to her and very precise when the manager of the club interrupted me and demanded that I \"Stop yelling\". It's a bar. It is loud. I was not yelling, however my tone was a bit sharp and my inflection was stern, but I was not yelling at anyone. I wanted my message to be received without misunderstanding. The manager continued to interrupt me while I was talking to the bartender. The bartender eventually did apologize, but I then had an issue with the manager insisting that I stop yelling. I continued to remind her I was not yelling, I was projecting my voice so both she and the bartender could hear me. I decided to end my evening and make my exit early. I will not return to this establishment in the future. I will also stop recommending this venue to family and friends"}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times now and have had a great experience every time.  The last show I saw there was Pinback and it was quite a good show.  What I thought was really cool was that Dry River Yacht Club was playing in the front room prior to the headliner.  The patio is great for hanging out and enjoying the weather, although it can get crowded.  Nice and intimate place to hear live music.  Not too big.  Great beer on tap and in cans and bottles.  I have heard good things about the food but haven't tried it yet.  It is definitely a place I will return to again and again."}
{"text":"Man oh man. Such disappointment. Went to have a beer and dinner as I have been here many many times before. As we walked in, fencing played on the television. Yes, the one with swords. The match had ended. We politely asked to put the soccer match on the screen as we were the only humans paying any attention in the baron bar. The bartender, Brett, denied our request and made a \"compromise\" and put the punisher on. Being that this movie sucked, we pleaded to go back to the fencing. But with no luck, we were forced to watch the punisher. Good food though."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop by for brunch. It was everything I expected and more.   Food was plentiful. And very reasonably priced.   Service was awesome! Make sure to ask for Carly, she was very attentive.   No reservations needed for brunch at this point, but that's going to change. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best night spot in downtown Phoenix. Excellent live music. We saw M83 here -- epic. Good beers, food, and atmosphere. Could have more beers on tap. We love the nachos and burritos  with the salsa."}
{"text":"Awesome venue!  We were starving and not sure if they even had food.  Yup, they did.  Best burrito I've ever had!  Not sure if that was my empty stomach talking or what.  The bartenders were super friendly and chill.  I love that they have bathrooms inside the venue, as well as a bar.  Can't wait to see another show."}
{"text":"As a concert venue - 4 stars - easy to get to, friendly staff, affordable drinks, good sound and a stream of good acts.  A welcome addition to downtown PHX.  As a restaurant - 2 stars - and here's why:  The Good: the guacamole appetizer - holy deliciousness.  The best I've had in a long time.  Try it.  The Bad: The Ensalada Cortado - a salad with a variety of greens and corn nuts - sounds delicious but was doused in so much dressing it was almost like a soup.  Strangely sweet while at the same time void of flavor.  Who knew?  The Ugly: The Al Pastor Pork Burrito - where to begin...  Mostly just beans, and more beans, surrounding a few slabs of fat-laden, hard to chew pork.  Not to be crass but this little beauty forced me to hit the restroom 4 times before noon the next day.  So I guess what I'm saying is, you have been warned.  Summary: I'd go back to see a show any time however I'll be eating elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Food is decent here, but lets be honest, if you're looking up this place it's because your favorite band is playing here.  Great room for an intimate show, staff is great, prices are reasonable. I'll definitely be back many times in the future for concerts. I'd probably eat dinner else where beforehand though."}
{"text":"Music venue: I believe this is the best one in town. Perfect combination of intimate standing and seating areas, and the sound is awesome. Every show I've seen here has sounded fantastic. A.  Parking: easy enough. Plenty of metered street parking that becomes free at 8. Pay lot across the street for $5. Also very close to the light rail stop. B+.  Food: Decent. Priced right. Had the barbacoa burrito and it was pretty tasty--better than Chipotle's, anyway. Good chips/salsa too. Wouldn't go out of our way to eat here, but if you're there and you're hungry, eat up. B.  Bathrooms: There is a one-seater in the lounge (sucks for the people just hanging out in the lounge--the line can get long) and a large, extremely clean one in the music venue area. Never had to wait in line or hold my breath. A.  Drinks: We were there the night they were sort of creating the Honey Badger and were lucky enough to be given a free sample. Hooked. They do cocktails right there. A.  Beer selection: Meh. Probably the only thing I'm going to find to complain about is the beer selection. Two bars--one in the lounge and one in the venue--and they have slightly different beers on tap. So you can get a Hoegarten in the venue but not in the lounge. They have a Sierra Nevada on tap along with a couple of Four Peaks beers and Stella (I think) and that's it for the taps. A few more crappy domestic canned selections rounds it out. I think they could do a lot better here.  You're using local chefs that use local ingredients to create menus here--why not take advantage of the local beer scene? Four Peaks is overused and overrated as far as I'm concerned, but people like it (I get it). How about some Sonoran? Prescott brewing? Nimbus?  C.  End of the day--I'm thrilled this place exists. I hope it puts the Clubhouse under."}
{"text":"Following my first negative review, I was encouraged to give Crescent another try. I've revisited 3x now and have received delicious food and courteous service.  Glad I gave this place another shot as it is right around the corner from my office."}
{"text":"It's two blocks from my office and within walking distance from the rest of downtown. I come early to get a table with stools because the stylish metal chairs are very uncomfortable. They fit nicely with the decor, but horribly with my butt. The service is usually quite good and the staff seems happy.  The food is not traditional Mexican fare; it's a more modern style.  My favorite is the seafood chowder, which unfortunately is not sold in the warmer months. It's my favorite soup in town.  They recently upgraded their street tacos by wrapping the excellent fillings with fantastic freshly made corn tortillas.  They also just added fresh masa sopes that are excellent.  Give it a try but don't show up before 11:30 -- I don't want you unwashed barbarians taking all the stools."}
{"text":"Nice place to see a show!   I'm new to the area, and have been here a few times to check out my friends bands while on tour. The venue is a nice size, not too big, not to small. The option to stay up front to avoid a cover or concert ticket is nice.   Sound quality is decent, not immaculate. There are bleachers against the back wall if you want to be seated to watch the show, and standing room in front of that. The only thing that's awkward is the divider that restricts alcohol in certain areas of the floor. I'm assuming it's for 18+ or all ages shows, but it's still just kind of weird to me. It's been configured differently each time I've been there. Regardless, nice spot to check out a show."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I've been here quite a few times for concerts. The atmosphere is great and the music they play (before the concerts, of course) is very fitting for the environment. The last time I was here I got a simple plate of nachos and everything tasted fresh and delicious. The entire staff are just all around great, down to earth people. I would definitely recommend this place whether you want to see a cool show or even if you just want to grab a bite to eat and chill."}
{"text":"This is the best venue in Phoenix for live music. I'm a musician and have played 5 of my 6 last shows there. It's one of the few venues where I actually want to stick around after we load in our stuff early in the evening. They treat local acts with a lot respect and really do a great job with sound.  The bean burrito is amazing with their green salsa.  I got to experience an amazing dance party here that happened out of thin air.  It changed my life forever."}
{"text":"Innovative venue. Bleacher seating in the back is a bit odd, but it works. Dig the long bar at the far end of the hall. Excellent sound. Haven't tried the food yet, but I intend to investigate."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a group of 5 for their 2000s R&B/Hiphop partaaay! Great atmosphere & great music reminiscent of the good ole high school/college days :) Some friends went to their 90s R&B/Hiphop event a few months back & enjoyed it too so go check that out! I want to come back for a flamenco show. Anyways, my 5 stars has to do with the set-up of this place. (Note: I've been here once before for post-dinner dinner since the fattie in me got hungry again. Ate their chips/guac & Sonoran dog & it was good. Get it if you like dirtydogs).   As I was saying, the set-up is nice because the outdoor area allows you to enjoy the food while having an audible conversation, but if you're curious about the live band/DJ/show or want to just vibe with the music you can sneak inside and grab a drink by the bar. And perhaps you like what you're hearing and want to dance it off ... the dance floor is yours! Our cover charge was $5 at the door for guys/girls ($3 if purchased online), I'm not sure if that's always the case. I REALLY liked that they have these \"bleacher seats\" extended across the back wall so if you're tired from dancing or maybe you don't like to dance at all but just want to enjoy the music, you can just chill back there without having to  pay for a table or deal with all the inconveniences of a swanky club.  Big plus for all you ladies in heels who need to rest your poor little toes!  *Parking: Plenty of metered parking and lots.. use them! I thought we snagged a great non-metered spot for free on the side street, but it was a fail & I got a parking ticket for being too close to a fire hydrant :( So watch yourself!"}
{"text":"great concert venue, except you never know when the main act is going on - stage. it's not that they always run late, that would be expected - but sometimes they start exactly on time and finish before 11 pm."}
{"text":"Great venue, also a really nice place to hang out and grab some drinks and food."}
{"text":"As an avid concert goer, the Crescent Ballroom is one of the best places I've ever seen a live show. The size of the venue is absolutely perfect; large enough for a good-sized crowed, but it's still small enough for an intimate vibe. The best part of Crescent is that I've seen everyone from tiny local bands to huge, top 40 bands (from Playboy Manbaby to Walk the Moon). The security here is SO friendly and helpful; as a teenage girl, I always feel safe and welcome. The under 21 section size changes based on how many people there are, but you can be close to the stage regardless of your age group bI've never had a bad experience at Crescent. Parking is cheap and there's a lot right on the property that usually has space, and there's plenty of street parking or other lots around. It's also very easy to meet the artists after a show which is always fun."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week. Tacos are pretty good, especially Fish. Service was just okay, took a while for them to come over to our table."}
{"text":"Found via Yelp and were delighted with a mid afternoon burrito bowl and cup of chicken tortilla soup. Will have to come back for desert."}
{"text":"This is one of the best mid-sized music venues I have been to in years. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship there. I plan on going back to try the food at some point. The interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when a band is playing! Trust me, it was much appreciated. I plan on being back, and soon!"}
{"text":"I went to the Destroyer concert on September 21st (forgot to finish my review that night =P) and the entire place smelled of paint thinner (or something else similarly awful). They didn't have fans or open doors or anything else to try to neutralize the odor. After feeling sick from an hour of being there I had to step out to get some fresh air but then came back in as the headliner was starting their set. After an hour and a half long set my head was KILLING me. The performance was great but I don't know if it was worth the migraine and upset stomach."}
{"text":"The street tacos are among the best I've ever had (the salsa is pretty damn good as well). I like their Lucha and Kilt Lifter beer. I've been to many shows here and plan on returning again."}
{"text":"5 stars on venue only.  Saw Anders Osborne and NMA on a weeknight.  Great drinks, fair prices.  Strange seating, so buy standing room only tickets.  The most impressive part is the sound system.  As a casual audiophile, I love when they get it right and it was probably one of the best sounding concerts I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Who has one bathroom for men and women to share in a bar! This is such a big downfall for me I spent half my time waiting in line instead of hanging with my friends:( I do like the atmosphere and the vibe."}
{"text":"Visiting from California just to enjoy Latin band and dance. It was great. Prices are surprisingly low. Plenty of staff, fast service."}
{"text":"First time last night at a concert. The venue is really small. Specially for a rock concert, but we had a blast. Towards the exit, the staff was very courteous. They asked us if we had a great night and if everything was ok. I thought that was nice. Definitely going back. It is a great place.  I left immediately after the concert, but next time, I would like to spend more time there. I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Great food, perfect music venue and super fun Sunday trivia night! I'm happy to say I frequent this establishment weekly."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and enjoyed the food!  I haven't been for a show or anything but the daytime menu was pretty good. pretty simple menu, not too spicy either."}
{"text":"Great acoustics and an intimate setting where anywhere you stand is within close proximity to the stage. Love that they have several large bars so no waiting in line for drinks. And.... super reasonable alcohol prices! A large row of bleacher seating lines the back wall so people wanting to sit have opportunity to do so.  I read reviews on Yelp about their Mexican food, served up front in an open air style restaurant. The food was absolutely excellent! We brought two starving college students with us so after they ordered six things between them, we were able to sample a decent part of their menu. Highlights are their guacamole, Sonoran hotdog and baked nachos were all highlights, two types of salsa amazing with excellent spice. I googled the restaurant menu to remind myself of the many dishes the kids ordered, and found out the restaurant is Concina 10 - started by chef Chris Bianco - which all makes sense now as to why the food is so outstanding. Chris also started Pizza Bianco in Phoenix, which has been recognized by several food writers as the best pizza in the United States.  This was my first visit to Crescent so definitely will be back to see more bands in this space, and also be back to dine there more often.  A final comment for concert goers under 21.... this is a great venue to get up close with the artists! The under 21 section opens up right up to the stage and even though the show we saw was sold out (Alex and Sierra), there are far less people in the under 21 section so a lot of standing room and stage access."}
{"text":"The front room is great. The food is delicious and the drinks are good. The only thing I dont really like it the back room, it feels like an old gym. It might be the look they are going for but its not for me. If you go on a night you like the live band, its pretty epic."}
{"text":"Came here for the free show with A Change of Pace/Damn The Weather and fell in love with the venue. From the moment I approached the door, the scintillating and seductive sounds of Flamenco Por La Vida spilled onto the street, stopping me in the front room as I passed through the doors. Apparently, they are a Saturday night staple and worth the trip alone. The front room is intimate, and the bar has a decent-above average selection of wine and beer. No food this night, but the show was fantastic and the staff knowledgeable. Great to come into a concert venue and not deal with cranky bar staff and bouncers, even for a free show. Thanks for being classy, I will definitely be back! (I am reserving the final star for once I taste the food, so expect an update at somepoint in the future.)"}
{"text":"Paid $20 each to see Ron Pope last night.  Went early to get some food.  Heard good things about it.   Got table.  No one came to help us so we went to the bar and got our own beers.   Finally waitress came over and we ordered some tacos.   I ordered another beer.  After 20 minutes no beer,,,,so I went to the bar and got another.  After 30 minutes we asked about the food, she said kitchen was busy.  After 40 minutes and seeing 30 people eat that had gotten there after us, we asked her what was up.  She finally went to the kitchen and came back and said oops something happened.   She promised the tacos in 5 minutes.   20 minutes later, a full hour after we ordered the tacos, we split.   Never even saw the concert.   Cool place.   Liked the trivia and vibe but service was Ridic."}
{"text":"It was a very nice atmosphere. The food was really good! We ordered to I-10 nachos and that order was huge! It was really filling and we also ordered the steak burrito which was also really good but for 9 $, it could be a little bigger. Don't forget to read through the sides because they have a few selections of special sauces that you can try"}
{"text":"Good food. I had the enchiladas and they were great.  Reasonable prices.  Both indoor and outdoor seating.  Good atmosphere and live music in the back."}
{"text":"Attended the Brett Dennen show on 3/17/14 and was really impressed by this venue. As a pretty regular visitor to all types of live music events, I think that I have a new favorite place to see a live show. Pretty much everything said by previous reviewers was true. The sound is top notch. The staff is customer-friendly at a level that I find perfect. Everyone I came in contact with was friendly and laid-back. Not over-the-top phony friendly and definitely  not a \"billy bad-ass\" attitude to be found anywhere (hear that Club Red?) The bar prices are very reasonable and even at a sold-out show the wait at the bar was never more than a minute.  For a bar with live music, the whole place is extremely clean. Even the restrooms are in good shape. It doesn't even have that old spilled beer smell.  Didn't try any of the food so can't comment on that.  Highly recommend for live music."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!  CONCERT PATRONS BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!  THEY ARE DISHONEST AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!  I bought 2 tickets through for Todd Rundgren, which sold out, for this venue through Stubhub 5 days ago.  We arrived an hour early, showed our tickets, and had our small purses searched twice. We entered the ballroom and ordered a cocktail then were told that food had to be ordered back out in the lobby.  So we went back to the lobby area, found a table, ordered food, ate, then returned to the ballroom entrance, 6 feet from where our table was.  We were told that we had to have wrist bands in addition to our tickets that were supposed to be issued  to each of us outside where our purses were searched. Neither of us had been here before so just did as we were told.  We showed our tickets to everyone including an unprofessional, rude, manager named Michelle but were refused entrance.  They reviewed their security cameras and halfway through the concert offered a wristband as they obviously realized that they made a mistake.  By this time, our evening was ruined.  I will NEVER EVER go here again and will dissuade everyone I know from going to such a dishonest and unprofessional place.  Stubhub is aware that our tickets were legitimate and that is was the fault of Crescent Ballroom's manager.  Stubhub is willing to return all of my money plus send us to his concert in California on July 11.  Unfortunately I have to work so will not be able to attend.  I was so looking forward to hearing one of my favorite musicians from my childhood.  What a huge disappointment!!! So sad."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my daughter before the Kris Allen/Parachute show. We had a great time and we were so surprised at the delicious food at a concert venue! My favs were the Tinga Chicken tacos and the fabulous bean dip. To top of off, we tried the \"bag of donuts.\" As we were devouring the fresh-fried mini-donuts with Nutella, we both decided, even if the meal hadn't been great (which it was) it would have been worth coming just for the donuts!   Had a vacation day on Friday and I couldn't think of any place I'd rather take my husband than back to the Crescent Ballroom so he could enjoy it, too. When I come back within a few days, it has to be good!   Concert was great as well, especially my fav Kris Allen!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a fantastic venue. The menu isn't extensive, but the food is so good that it more than makes up for what some might see as a lack of variety. Perfect for those times when you get a craving for an amazing basket of nachos between bands (the next room over, in The Crescent Ballroom). Prices were reasonable too. I'm already contemplating what to order on my next visit."}
{"text":"Super cool place. Unique, great crowd, low key, I pay attention to the way people treat people and if they make a difference between races, in this place they treat everybody the same. I highly recommend you to come and listen to the bands."}
{"text":"This is what the whole valley needed for a long time.  This IS the best venue for music in town.  The size, location, decor, and food/drink are all right on the money.  Ha, you need to go, even if you don't like hanging out with the abundance of hipsters and such.   The place is way cool and needs to be the focus of an entire city renovation."}
{"text":"Easy access. Clean and Classy. The perfect place to see artist perform. Get your tickets early. Events often sell out."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the Mason Jennings concert, it was amazing!  The room was a good size, so we were right up close and personal!  Very friendly staff! I didn't have any food, but there are places to sit and have a good time before the concert.  Only complaint:  I did not get an open tab, but I did get Coors all night, and each bar tender I went to charged me something different.  Kind of strange.  Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Went there for NYE. Met Charlie on the street. He welcomed us into the party. 80's music, rat pack music and EDM. We came in search of excitement and found what we were looking for. The staff were all very energetic and smiling. My friend and I will certainly be back soon. Thank you Charlie for such a memorable night!"}
{"text":"I wasn't aware that the phrase 'Downtown Douchebags' existed. While fellow Phoenix brethren enjoy utilizing expressions such as 'Chandler Trash' or 'Scottsdale Douchebags', I was surprised when a friend of a friend inquired if Crescent Ballroom was indeed \"where all the downtown douchebags hung out.\" While I think it's quite normal to find douchey people across the wide spectrum of AZ, I found this particular term a bit of a misnomer. I think utopian would have been a more appropriate word to replace downtown, which was simply too broad in scope. Even so, I don't think that Crescent Ballroom has the utopian vibe associated with some local Phx spots; it's an entirely different experience.  The crowd at Crescent is diverse and impressive, and the variety in music is overwhelming. We've rocked out with the Tune-Yards, experienced the nautical dreamy music of Active Child, established rapport on the patio with Black Carl and complained about the sound issues of Portugal. The Man. We've regretted missing shows like St. Vincent, Geographer, Manchester Orchestra and M83. In September, Yeasayer is coming to Crescent. I never would have imagined finding a venue in Phoenix where I could see ALL of these bands play. I think the saddest part of that last statement is I never expected these to be the bands that I would want to see live.   Sometimes, after shows have ended, they have a DJ come out and play songs that I recognize because I shop at Urban Outfitters and then I proceed to destroy everyone on the dance floor.   It would be unacceptable to review Crescent without mentioning the food. I have consumed all of their burritos, their hamburger and cheese crisp (I add MEAT) and can confirm that the ingredients used for these items were cultivated and prepared by the Pagan gods that I will continue to worship. Beer selection is fairly adequate since I can order Hop Knot in a can. Prices for drinks are pretty normal and the price for shows will vary depending on a scale of one to Bon Jovi.   Lastly, there are a lot of parking and places to lock your bike which is very important to me because I ride a neon green fixed gear since I'm a Downtown Douchebag."}
{"text":"Good low key place to hang out. Perhaps even catch a show. I had a drink with muddled strawberries and it was quite tasty. One of the drawbacks here is the facilities... you break the seal, you're going to have  to wait in line for a while."}
{"text":"I can't believe what a great venue the Crescent Ballroom is. It's as if the owners/designers thought, \"What do people want before, during, and after a concert?\" (Then they correctly answered, \"Booze, burritos, and more booze. We'll throw plenty of clean bathrooms in there for good measure.\")  The other night I got the chance to see St. Vincent at CB. The concert space is a great size - it fits plenty of people (even with places to sit!) - but you still get to be at one of those intimate shows where you can SEE the band. And if I'm going to a St. Vincent concert, I want to SEE the beautiful Annie Clark as she's playing. Not just a humanoid shape on a stage so far away that I can only assume that it's the band that I hear playing.   If your favorite band is playing at Crescent Ballroom, do not miss the opportunity to see them at this venue. It is a great addition to downtown Phoenix with a bonus of being located only a block away from the lightrail stations. Get there early for some food and drinks too."}
{"text":"El pastor Burrito, a cold Tequila Fresca, live music, and top it off with a hot churro! My favorite music venue in AZ by far!  Been here on several occasions and every visit has passed my expectations. The food is delicious and affordable. The specialty drinks are unique and kickass; however slightly more expensive. There is ample seating both in the lounge and music venue area, and there really is no bad seat in the house.  The scene is very diverse but leans more towards the hipster side; however this all depends on who is playing.   The audio quality is above average in the music venue area, and the small setting makes for a very intimate show.  Highly suggest this place and I hope it is here for as long as I am!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best music venues in Arizona. The bar and food plus the lounge area is perfect. Hope they get more shows and stay around."}
{"text":"Cool place for a show. Great sound. Cool service. Full bar. Parking is not terrible if you get there early."}
{"text":"Really dope bar! The crowd was full of dope people but no one was rude or pushy. The honey badger is an excellent choice if you're confused what to order.   The sound system was incredible and it was like I was attending the show even thing I didn't get the chance to go kn"}
{"text":"Fabulous little gem attached to the Crescent Ballroom. A casual, upbeat restaurant with American and Mexican fare. Not your run of the mill offerings, though. Cocina 10 puts its own spin on favorites and we haven't been disappointed. I highly recommend the blackened salmon salad. It's a source of culinary comfort to me. The seasoning is perfect. The veggies are crisp. Mango! Houston, we have mango. DH is working through the menu and has already been delighted by the Lolo Burger and Street Tacos. The desserts struggle. There is chocolate bark, rice pudding, and mini churros. I would like to see one large piece of cake for sharing. That is my only complaint.  One of the best things about this place is the people who frequent it. A very diverse, pleasant crowd."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter to the St. Vincent/Cate Le Bon show at this venue last night.  The place rocks!  The stage is large, but very accessible to the crowd.  The lighting and sound are fantastic!  It is well-staffed, and even at a sold-out show, I never had to wait long for service.  It's a beautiful example of adaptive re-use, and most decidedly exactly what downtown needs to see more!  They clearly know their audience, too.  There were two large bike racks, which we were happy to see, since we biked the short distance to the venue from home.  The lounge is also cool; I will review the kitchen separately.  It was so gratifying to see so many people walking/biking/light-railing home after the show.  If you are a fan of live music, you will most definitely want to check out The Crescent Ballroom.  Well done!"}
{"text":"This place usually books the best shows. Great nachos!  Fun place. Absolutely Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to go back to add to this one, but I want to spend every weekend here!  I just wish I'd brought boots that were made for walking (or dancing).  I stopped in on New Year's Ever for last call expecting a nightmare of a crowd, and after the hilarious bouncer allowed us inside, I heard the most amazing drum and bass coming from the back room.  I was immediately transported back to the late 90's when I enjoyed many a night in an abandoned Phoenix warehouse listening to local DJs spinning House, DnB and whatever other variety was happening at the time.  The crowd was mixed and accommodating and the bartenders knowledgeable.    Can't wait to go back with my dancing shoes!  PS - did I mention the DJ was actually spinning vinyl?  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Nice barbacoa beef burrito.  Great service (kudos Mary & Corina!)   Casual hipster vibe. Reasonable prices.  Could use a touch more flavor on the barbacoa (ask for their homemade hot sauce) & a little less frying of the tortilla. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A friend and myself saw a show here last night (The Von Trapps). The staff was mostly friendly, but more importantly security was friendly. This place feels cool and trendy and the drink prices were comparable, not cheap but not expensive either. We shared a carne quesadilla and it was perfect and delicious. The space is pretty small, but it works. It basically just looks like a bar and restaurant when you walk in until these doors in the back open up and then you see the (small) ballroom equipped with a raised stage, bleachers against the wall, a full bar, and more bathrooms. Good sound too! There are like 4 or 5 metered parking spots right in front, but aside from that, there are two public lots with $5 pay boxes. Cool place."}
{"text":"Hello lova', where have you been all my life? Wow, I love this venue. Went there for the first time last night to see Face to Face acoustic and I just love the sound, the layout, the vibe. A great place to see music. This is coming from someone who worked in the indie music business for 5 years, 1.5 of those years spent touring so I've seen my share of venues.   I don't know what this place would be like with a DJ or full rock band, but it was great so an acoustic act and I hope the shows I want to see coming through town play here.   I also love that its a restaurant/bar. I would hang here just for dinner or drinks. Plus the bands play loud enough you can hear them from the restaurant. So I guess if the show is sold out or you are flat broke you can still hear whoever is playing.  Excited to take my bf here next week for the Revival Tour."}
{"text":"This place is going to put PHX on the map. Wide variety of music every night! Hot bar tenders including a tall curly haired Red Head! Damn she makes a killer Margarita Fresca!!!! If this place had a happy hour I'd be there every day with my moderate drinking problem!  Haha"}
{"text":"Mediocre ass food but I'm here with my fam deadass b. Fire ass ambience but the talent aiiiight."}
{"text":"Great space, great sound, great owner. Best place in Phoenix to see a band."}
{"text":"Great venue for music and always an energetic scene during special celebrations like Halloween or New Years. A lower key, hip alternative to the upscale, snooty scottsdale clubs."}
{"text":"One of the best places to see a show in phx ! Great food, great drinks, great bands, great sound, great lighting. Clean bathrooms , very friendly staff.  I've never had a bad experience here, I've been coming since they opened. Their chips and salsa are top notch and crescent ballroom is always my 1st choice when grabbing drinks or food downtown. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Likes: -Cheaper drinks than most bars in Phoenix (cough-ihatecopperbluesprices-cough) -Hearing music playing in the venue area -Not being rushed to leave tables and you can hang in here awhile  Dislikes: -1 stall bathroom for women (and men apparently?) I know they probably don't have the room, but it really sucks when someone takes more than 5 min. and you are waiting -Brought in a coupon that apparently was \"not approved by them\" but on a top coupon site. I got a \"well fine.. we will honor it this time, but only on one drink. you can't use that here again, we don't approve those coupons\" I felt like a criminal. Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea -The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink, you got to just grab the bartenders attention. I wish the had a system because it makes it difficult when it is busy"}
{"text":"Didn't try any of the food, I stopped in for a documentary that they were showing \"Huicholes: The Last Peyote Guardians.\"  The atmosphere of this place is great, and the staff is extremely friendly!  I asked if they had coffee, which they didn't at the time but didn't hesitate to start brewing some right up!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer bar and not to mention my friend and I were allowed inside to catch the last of Dr. Dog's set.   What a chill place."}
{"text":"good drinks, good food and great music.  Love their patio and upper outside deck!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here! The green salsa is amazing- you can also order a good amount to go for next to nothing.   I always order the shrimp or carne asada tacos, the quesadillas are good too!  On top of the great food the customer service is always exceptional - no matter how busy they are.   If your in the area I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great small venue, friendly staff and security! Mike Gordon put on a fun show! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude and unprofessional manager. Our party went to the Xavier Rudd concert on 7/31 and decided to show up early to eat and drink in the restaurant before the show.    Our waitress had zero personality, was unfriendly and even managed to charge our credit card to the wrong bill. We couldn't figure out if she was half asleep or purposely trying to mess with us. I mean, who delivers drinks by holding each glass by the rim?  After spending nearly 2 hours and plenty of money in this place we're ready to walk into the concert. They tell us we need wristbands first. No problem, we walk to the front door to get our wristbands, the girl tells us we need to go outside and wait in line, everybody needs to show id to get in. We all had brand new drinks, so I ask if we are allowed to take our drinks with us to go outside, they say no drinks have to stay inside. The whole purpose of the wristbands was to show who was over 21, which we are and we are now holding beers so obviously we are over 21. I get the manager, she also wants us to go wait in line outside and leave our drinks inside (so somebody can spike them?). After arguing we finally get the wristbands; which in hindsight probably should have been given to us with our check since we had our tickets on the table the whole time and even showed them to the waitress.  The concert was great though, I would go see Xavier Rudd anywhere. Also the food itself was good and the bartenders on the inside of the concert area were friendly."}
{"text":"Nice venue for a show with a separate lounge and outdoor seating area. Good service and great bands. Get out and support downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good Venue. We saw Squeeze last night (great show) and were really happy at how intimate the place was. You're never more than about 60 feet from the band, even when you're in the bathroom. It also helped that it was pretty much a douche-bag free zone but I digress. It was a 21 and older show and the lines at the bar moved along really well. Sound level was reasonable and appropriate for the space. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple of months now for the exquisite tacos and guac. The first time I had eaten here, the food was amazing and so was the service. As my boyfriend and I kept coming to enjoy the amazing tacos, the service has completely gone down the drain. The last time we came in, we walked through the front doors and stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting for the girl who was bussing the table in front of us to say anything to us. But she didn't, she kept cleaning and walked off. Someone else seated us eventually. Our server was very slow with drinks and didn't care to ask how the food was.   I really enjoy the tasty food here, it's just unfortunate that the service really sucks!!"}
{"text":"This place brings great shows to phoenix. That's why I give it 2 stars over one. Also I like that most shows are all ages or 16+.   Music is good and sound quality is nice!  They have messed up artists sound quality in the past . The staff is super hipster and not really my favorite. Security is pretty awful in my opinion      I like other venues in phoenix way more. It's an ok set up and bar. And the scene is pretty horrendous"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice cocktail variety & awesome venue!  We visited cb for happy hour & the Nick Waterhouse concert.    *We were thrilled with the happy hour menu and we ordered nachos, tacos, & bean dip.  *Beer & wine on happy hour but sadly my margarita was not!  Oh well I still had 3. Loved the tall glass of tangy tequila paradise to pre party for our retro guitarist friend Nick.  *The fish tacos were delicious with great seasoning! Finally a restaurant that's not afraid to flavor something simple!  *The nachos were over the top with every topping item you may dream of.  Absolutely the pinnacle of Arizona nacho happiness.  Our server was a nice professional gal- I think Melissa?  Really appreciated her listening and timing to make our night fly by talking with friends.  Everyone from start to finish at crescent ballroom was professional & patient though not overly friendly.  I can appreciate straight to the point and don't always need an emotional connection with the bartender.  As a concert venue they have the standing area with bleacher style seating in the back.  We did a combo of standing / sitting/ walking around.  The bathroom was huge with no one in there!  Usually concert bathrooms are long waits- not at this posh hipster venue!  Finally they have a bar inside the venue so we were glad for the Arizona stronghold rose & cocktails."}
{"text":"There are much better Mex places in PHX. Don't go there for their food. Drinks and music... that's different."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Cool hipster punk place with live music or trivia. The burrito bowls are to die for. For drinks, I go for the sangria or the house margaritas. LOVE the food, LOVE the music, LOVE the atmosphere!! Great place! Which they had the outdoor heaters on more often in the winter though."}
{"text":"Pretty good little venue. The food is delicious. The bartenders are prompt to notice you trying to get a drink, even if it's loud and crowded."}
{"text":"Decided to take my gf here after someone told me about the place and the music. It was only 10 bucks per person and no eat or drink minimum which was good since we'd already gotten dinner. Very surprised by the wide age groups of the people there, not sure if there grand-kids were performing or if they just liked alternative rock.  I almost never go to any sort of music venue so it was a fun experience, in all honestly I went to see Jim Adkins is some capacity but I don't know if I missed him cause we were got there around 8:15 or what.   Other people seemed to really be enjoying themselves and having a good time and we were too but I'm not into overtly loud sounds just for the sake of it being loud (we sit in the very back) but it was really loud (I could feel the vibrations in my chest at times) for an enclosed music venue with only like 100-125 people there. Gospal Claws was fun and I would have stayed longer to listen to their whole thing and maybe see Adkins but I decided an hour and a half was enough volume overload for my ears so we left. They were very nice and thanked us for coming as we left.   I'm sure people more accustomed to concerts and whatnot don't have a problem with the volume but I literally had no choice other than leaving or dealing with the sound since there was no way for us to physically go further back without leaving the music hall."}
{"text":"I love the Crescent Ballroom.  It's a very small venue where you can have the chance to see some really amazing artists.  I have been to 4 concerts there this year, and every one was fantastic.  I love that they have a bar inside the concert area.  The attached restaurant is also delicious.  You will recognize the food from Gallo Blanco, which is one of my personal favorites in Phoenix.  The happy hour specials are pretty good.  I also had the chance to check out a free flamenco performance there this past Saturday.  It was so cool!  They perform weekly, and I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Recently I had lunch at Crescent Ballroom on a work trip to Phoenix. I would recommend this restaurant as an inexpensive, trendy Mexican option in Downtown Phoenix.  The restaurant has an adaptive reuse warehouse vibe with lots of wood, metals and glass. Very urban and trendy looking.  Pros: I ordered three tacos, 1 shredded chicken, 1 barbacoa and 1 blackened tilapia. All 3 tacos were delicious and I was very happy with my order. The ingredients (avocado, cilantro, tomato, cabbage) were fresh, and the presentation of the food was good. I personally liked the barbacoa taco the most, had a little spicy kick.  Cons: Service was slow and our waitress seemed disengaged. There was a 20 minute lag between members of our party receiving their main course lunch orders. I know there are longer waits at lunch, but it shouldn't take that long to serve tacos.  Overall I enjoyed the food and my dining experience at Crescent Ballroom and would return."}
{"text":"I just have one thing to say...i am going to wake up at 3AM dreaming about those El Pastor tacos with Pineapple pico!!! and that green tomatillo salsa...want to swim in it. okay, that was two things."}
{"text":"Thank you Crescent Ballroom for your gallo blanco influenced al pastor burrito stylings, the pairing of homemade ginger beer and brown, and your small - I could be somewhere other than Phoenix it is so cool - venue."}
{"text":"There's never a bad night at the crescent ballroom. I really enjoy the music that they bring in and I love the intimacy of the concerts. Please don't change!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my absolute favorite venue in all of the Valley.  I've seen about 6 or 7 shows here now.  It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much \"there\".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)  The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!    I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.  Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.  Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!  Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.  I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet."}
{"text":"Crescent is the BEST venue for a show in Phoenix. The seating, the space, the sound -- it all comes together perfectly. Crescent can even accommodate a small music fest with their outdoor stage set up.  You never have to wait too long for a drink at the bar and this venue is always clean.   My friends and I mostly come here on the weekends for cheap drinks/house wine and their bar food menu. If you haven't yet, go ahead and try the nachos or the bean and cheese burrito and tell me it's not the best bar food you've ever had.   They have different music nights (e.g. Funk Night) during the week. You can dance if you want to."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. They have such great Indie Artists that perform and they also do trivia, have taco specials(obviously awesome) and a few solid beer choices! Always a good place to go with friends or even on a first date(earlier in the evening)."}
{"text":"Such an incredible addition to Arizona. We are so lucky to have this place. I always order the nachos.."}
{"text":"We arrived and we were greeted by security and told us we could seat ourselves. We waited fir about 15 min and no one came to take our order, manager kept telling us that he would send someone to our table. 30 min later still no one came!! My husband ended up walking to the bar and placing the order. When our food finally arrived It was amazing!!! Giving credit where credit is due. Tacos were just like the ones my grandma made in Mexico! Tortillas tasted hand made, if you are Mexican you know what that means. Food made up for the horrible service I guess... SHOUT OUT to the kitchen staff for their great food!!!! Thank yo Can't say the same for the horrible lack of service from the waitress staff."}
{"text":"Top notch fantastic place with live music! Their Street snack was amazing! Would visit again and many times over!"}
{"text":"great venue, great service, great food- they always have both patios for smoking though and they woft pretty badly in to the venue when the doors are left open."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom is a great place to get a drink, eat and see your favorite band.  Really a good downtown vibe. When you first enter, you have the restaurant and bar - which is great. The next room in the back is the main stage for events. Love this venue for music, great hangout!"}
{"text":"I used to pass by this area all the time on my bike and remember this whole corner pretty abandoned and quiet. Then during Art Detour when trying to find my lil bro's bike tour he was leading, we passed what I thought was still a sleepy corner to find Crescent Ballroom.   First impressions were great just riding by. Patio seating looked inviting and artwork hanging inside made me want to stop in, but not just yet, we had a bike ride to finish.   Luckily enough, my bro suggested we stop here after the ride for some drinks. Great idea. They had plenty of local brews on tap so I got my fav Four Peaks Kiltlifter and for a small snack we ordered the trail mix.   As predicted, patio seating was great! The lights on top of the building were set up to give the right about of lighting at night and our server did a great job of keeping us happy. The trail mix ($2.00) was awesome too, it came in a brown paper bag and did the job of holding us over till we ate later that evening.   Although this place makes a great bar, it looks like it would make an even better music venue. That will have to be for another night, but a band was setting up, and forewarned, you have to pay extra to sit in the room the band plays, but I'm sure that's part of how the band gets paid so I can't hate on that.   The Crescent Ballroom is a little off the beaten path for most visitors to downtown, so I imagine you'll see a lot of local downtowners which is great, and I hope to catch a show or grab some beers before a Suns game here again sometime."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Love the chicken tanga tacos and drinks. Great place for live bands and music also give the rice pudding a try u won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Taco Wednesday how I love thee! If you have not been to Taco Wednesday you are missing out! The street Barbacoa are my favorite, along with the Tonga. Always great service and some of the best Iced Tea on the valley! Yay tacos"}
{"text":"Don't let the name of this place fool you it's a hip bar with entertainment on Saturday night. Mexican food menu a the salsa is really great like no other? It's kind of creamy? Delicious. Drinks are great and the patio is the scene.."}
{"text":"great venue. horrible service. bartender ignores you and so do the waitresses."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Why have I never had the food here?! I can't believe I missed out on it all those years of studying downtown and looking for lunch spots. The tacos were some of he best and the margaritas were perfect! We will absolutely come back for dinner, even if we aren't down there for a show.  Event venue is awesome. The bathrooms were clean and easy to get to and you don't feel like you are missing out on the show because it's in the same space. We didn't have to go to the bar inside because we brought our drinks from dinner but it looked like people were getting good service. And the space itself is spread out enough to not feel crowded but close enough to feel intimate with the artists."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I would give it five stars but I went on Saturday night and the bartenders suck. A woman and a man. accusing me of not tipping, smh. Hire some people who can be friendly and not look all bitter like they hate their job."}
{"text":"Was here on Thursday, 12/11/2013, to see French Horn Rebellion.  Very nice beer selection, and VERY impressed with the barbacoa tacos with the guacamole that I had.  Delicious!  Staff was very nice and engaging, and the crowd was very pleasant and courteous (people complimented me on my dancing :) ), like people have already said.  I'm definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"The crescent ballroom is a small sized venue with a mature atmosphere. They have a small selection of delicious craft beers that they are usually changing out. They also host the Arizona Storytellers events several times a year. I can't say enough good things about this venue, they are really one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. This is my favorite music venue in Phoenix. The crescent ballroom is a small sized venue with a capacity of about 550."}
{"text":"Thanks Crescent Ballroom for a stellar New Years Eve celebration! We got advance tickets for the bash - only $5 pp. Let's see what all went down between 9 PM and 1 AM: My new years eve meal = an $8.50 burrito that tasted fresh, with well cooked and well-seasoned meat; I was pleasantly surprised considering it came out of a big nondescript cooler; bartenders were nice and efficient; Drinks weren't outrageously expensive. Music was awesome, an eclectic mix of songs from the past three decades; there was an artist doing a painting live on stage while the DJ was blasting away - very cool to see; the crowd was late 20s-early-30s-hipsters-heavy; People cheered when some dude opened his umbrella in the middle of the crowd - gotta love the random hilarity. Dance floor was packed by 11 PM. It looked like the kind of dance floor for people who say \"I don't really dance\". To clarify, that's an observation, not a complaint. Nothing wrong with it.   Overall I'm glad we picked here for our one night in Phoenix/NYE outing."}
{"text":"If  a Hipster younger crowd is on your list then by all means run don't walk because this is YOUR place. The music venue is great. The sound system is awesome too. I really like the kick back stadium seating they have if you don't need to be in the crowd. Very cool something for everyone in the live venue. The service was fast & the noise level high. Def not a date night place if you're wanting to chat someone up but fun for sure."}
{"text":"Great food great ambience service is seriously lacking. last time I was there apparently I was in the bartenders way strange considering I was sitting at the bar . unfortunately people become complacent in their jobs and then seem to feel that they don't need to treat people kindly. it's one of the big reasons I don't go more often. . If I would have been treated better I probably would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Crescent ballroom offers different types of music each night! Which is awesome because you get to meet all kinds of people in the area.  Lately they've been having lines for entry so it's becoming more and more popular.  They've also added a canopy and prettt lights outside.. Drinks are always made right and very affordable."}
{"text":"I am frequently at Crescent due to the awesome lineup of bands rolling through town but just recently I tried their tacos. OMG. Just thinking about the fish or vegetarian tacos makes me hungry.   The ballroom is my favorite venue to see bands in PHX. If a band is scheduled at the marquee I get so sad. Its just such a crappy venue compared to the wonderful crescent. Whether it is a HUGE sold out show or a free local band, any night at the Crescent is a good night. I just wish people would stop getting up in the front of the dance floor and just hangout on their phones the whole time I MEAN COME ON! Respect the band and dance your ass off if you are going to be in front! Or I might just have to punch your phone out of your hands ;)  Anyways get the tacos. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown Phoenix!! Now, I have yet to see a show here but if it is anything like their bar then it is sure to be fantastic.    Exposed brick, an old piano, large windows, metal tables and dim lighting provide for an enjoyable bar experience.  There are large doors that separate the venue side from the bar area.  Their strawberry cocktail (Rest Stop)  is one of my favorites drinks ever - its the right amount of flavor and alcohol without the over abundance of sugar, like most strawberry cocktails have.   The Mexican food here can hold its own and is way more than just \"bar food!\""}
{"text":"Crescent has addressed the bathroom situation that I was so frustrated about before and now I have nothing bad to say about this venue. This is a great place to see a show or to just hang out in the lounge/patio. Their drinks and food are fantastic and priced right. The bartenders and servers are always quick and friendly. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love love love this little bar. I have now been here twice and I like it more and more every time I come. The have a small but focused food menu and tons of great drinks.  The first time I went, I ate a green chile cheeseburger that came with chips and salsa. The burger was a bit oversalted, but other than that it was very good. I also had a drink called the Pitstop which was vodka with lemon soda and strawberries, kinda like a strawbery mojito. Overall it's a great spot to enjoy an awesome patio, some drinks and (although I've yet to experience it) live music. Excited to see some music here next time I visit!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love everything about Crescent.  We've been about 5 times now and always looking to go back.  Intimate setting with patio and front restaurant/bar and full service bar in the venue portion.  Food is really good and inexpensive.  Shows are always really inexpensive with a close up experience and quality sound.  Love the quaintness and service.  Well run place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for concerts and have been to trivia night on Sundays with my girlfriend a few times in the last couple months. They've had some really great bands play there and their ticket prices are reasonable. Trivia night is also super fun. Sometimes the questions are annoying but the prizes are good enough to keep us coming back. Their food is probably my favorite part. I really like their al pastor burritos; we had carne asada nachos last time and they were super good as well. Crescent Ballroom is an all around great spot to come hang out"}
{"text":"Great place to see both national and local acts. Live music most nights. DJ's too.   When you walk up to the place you'll see the outdoor sitting area. When you first walk inside you'll be in the smaller stage area with tables, a full bar, and a TV or two.  Further in is where the larger stage is.  My friend plays here and her band gets paid decently. You have to appreciate a venue that pays musicians for their talent and the crowd they bring in. If you have ever been to NY or LA you know many venues have a \"pay to play\" system. Not cool.  Food is good and decently priced. Most beers on tap. Decent options for drinks and wine.  Great place to experience downtown Phoenix's music scene. Yes we have a music scene. It's just completed spread out across the metropolitan area we call home."}
{"text":"I came to Crescent Ballroom to see a live performance on a Tuesday night. For some reason by the sounds of the name, I thought it was going to be a large ballroom. To my delight, it was a small and intimate venue. There was plenty of parking right in front which made me very excited. The doorman was very nice and told me about the metered parking. Wow thanks! Friendly bouncers, totally not what I'm used to coming from NYC.   Inside, the venue was split into two different rooms. The front half looked like a cocktail/sports bar where I got to catch the ending of a Warriors game. The back half was the music venue which also had bleacher type seating in the back of the room. I had a great time not feeling squashed or trampled and just enjoying a weekday out immersed in music."}
{"text":"I love this place! Just what downtown Phx needed. Great food and a great music venue."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, so satisfied we decided to try this venue (a friend's recommendation) for dinner after a Mercury game downtown!!! The blackened salmon salad was delicious! They offer an amazing grilled chicken quesadilla that was ever so tasty! Enjoyed the Aradon Tinto red wine from Spain! Very hip venue with an eclectic clientele! We were pleased and will definitely return SOON!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to see live music.  This place is in a great location. Easy walking distance from other stuff downtown.  The bouncers have always been very friendly with us on our visits. The staff at the door and bar have been cool.  It's a new place with plenty of room for the acts who play there. They have bleacher seating, tables, and standing room. They have pretty good sound equipment that so far seems to work as expected.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is the first venue I can think of in Phoenix that is actually a cool place to watch live music, AND eat a satisfying meal. I was intrigued when I heard it was another place to watch a good show, but it definitely became a priority when I heard that Chris Bianco (owner of Pizzeria Bianco) and Doug Robson (owner of Gallo Blanco) were in charge of the restaurant on the other side of the door.  During my first visit, we were there to support a band and only had time for chips and guac (yum), but the rest of the food looked great! I will make sure I get there with plenty of time to spare before our next trip to Crescent so i can enjoy more of what their kitchen has to offer.  As far as a music venue goes, I was impressed. Great sound, and juuuust small enough to feel intimate, but big enough to accommodate a good amount of people. Bleacher seats in the back are a nice reward for people that are early to their  show."}
{"text":"Hey Hey Hey AZ it's Analynn ... If you are ever downtown Phoenix make sure you hit the Crescent Ballroom ! I gave this hidden gem five stars! With amazing live entertainment , hipster vibe and deliciously fresh homemade food and taco 's . Featured headlining band last night was Royal Tides(R/T) !!! Thanks to all the bands for a great evening ! If you go I hope you enjoy it as much as I did ."}
{"text":"...  so you have been frustrated with the lack of any good venues in Phoenix since Nitas closed...  a gazillion years ago.  Enter The Crescent Ballroom.  This place is unbelievable.  I clocked in 3 shows the opening week and was VERY impressed.  When you enter the venue you are first in the front lounge area.  Two front patios pair the door and are ample size for open air drifters and proud smokers.  Inside the lounge, there is an airy feel due to the huge un obtrusive  door that open to the patios.  It is appointed with a nice piano for piano happy hour and DJs are occasionally assigned to play the hippest tunes.    From here you can enter the main room of the venue where the main acts play.  The stage is to the right and huge.  There is bleacher seating (like nice rich wood bleachers) along the left hand wall.  Straight ahead you will find another large bar...  don't worry about not getting a drink quick here.    The sound is amazing.  It is loud, but not hurt your ears loud.  Most likely due to the master crafting Sound man who is the resident there.  They spared no expense in equipping this place, because first and foremost, it is a music venue.  They take that business very seriously.  The show I saw were perfectly balance and a pleasure to watch.    My favorite part about this place...  you don't get pushed out the door when the show is over.  It almost feels weird to not get herded out.   The front lounge offers up the best post show spot where show goers can chat about life, music and bikes...  I have never seen such an impressive mass of hip bikes in my life.  Do yourself a favor, pick a show - any show and make a night of it at the Crescent.  It is awesome."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom has been one of my favorite downtown Phoenix locations since I first moved to AZ nearly three years ago. In the time between then and now, I have been to Crescent Ballroom for tons of music shows and even a literary function (Spillers)!  FOOD / DRINK  For all the times I've visited, I have YET to try the food. How screwed up is that!? I'll have to change that here sometime soon... I have, however, partaken of the bar menu, which is wonderfully diverse. I'm a single malt scotch guy, so seeing multiple scotch options at a venue bar gets me excited. The beer list is also pleasingly varied.  VENUE  But enough about food/drink. What about the venue? As a venue, Crescent Ballroom holds my #1 favorite spot. They host such a wide range of bands and seem to have a really good eye for new \"indie\" music that's trendy and relevant.  SOUND  Sound is the biggest factor for whether or not I can enjoy my time at a music venue. Having been a musician myself, I know all that goes into a solid audio mix. I am VERY pleased to report that Crescent Ballroom has consistently featured the most professional sound engineering. I'm super picky about this, so being able to depend on them for a good mix means a lot! I'm quite certain the bands who play here feel the same.  BALLROOM  The ballroom features plenty of standing room, a bar all its own, bleachers (!), and typically multiple water dispensers at various locations within the ballroom so you don't have to wait for ages at the bar just to \"order\" a cup of water when you're parched from drinking/singing/screaming.  PARKING  Even parking isn't that big of a deal at Crescent Ballroom because they have a decent-sized lot of their own in addition to plenty of street parking within easy walking distance.  CONCLUSION  To this day, I can't say I've had a single bad experience at Crescent Ballroom. If you haven't been, I recommend that you keep an eye on their music calendar and find an excuse to catch a concert. If you'd rather not wait, then go enjoy a dinner on the patio! You're likely to be surprised by a small performance of some kind and, even if you're not, I'm sure you'll agree that the atmosphere and service alone are reason enough to consider the trip worthwhile.  Thank you, Crescent Ballroom team, for working so hard to provide an enjoyable experience. You've been great. Can't wait to see you again really soon!"}
{"text":"Although I was only there for a show this place was awesome. Loved the vibe and the staff with the little interaction we had were awesome. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent the Crescent Ballroom because of all the great shows that come in here to play and the great atmosphere in the front room and patio.  This is a great place to come for a show or just to hang out and grab some food or drinks. There is always something awesome to check out here no matter what day of the week. Most of the shows do have some sort of cost, but it is usually worth the price. I have seen tons of shows here in the past and had a wonderful time. The venue is very personal and offers a wide array of options for you to enjoy the show, including lots of standing room, high table tops, and stadium blenchers in the back. Inside the venue there are conveniently located bathrooms, the merch table and a bar.  Drinks - The bottled beer selection here is pretty decent but the draft selection of beers is very limited. I would recommend sticking to hard liquor here. The Vodka Sodas here are some of the best and strongest in town. After just three of these drinks you will be feeling very good. They also carry a personal favorite of mine, Templeton Rye whiskey. A glass on the rocks will run you $10, but it is well worth it.  Food - I have heard many good things about the food from the Crescent, but I have only ever ordered the nachos.  These nachos are awesome though! They are delicious but expensive at ~$13. However, they can easily feed 2-4 people so the cost is not that bad unless you are the one treating the table. I am very interested in coming here during the day to try other food. Most of the menu is extremely affordable and sounds delicious, especially for a concert venue.  Staff/Service - I have only been here at night, but it is pretty typical not to receive any sort of table service if you are at the front room or on the patio. I would recommend ordering all drinks and food up at the bar. The bar staff are super nice and work quickly to get everyone's order taken care of. If you are ordering food they will give you a card to bring back to your table so someone else can deliver your food.  I love the Crescent Ballroom and it is by far one of my favorite spots in town. If you like live music you have to give this place a try. The staff, drinks, food or music will not disappoint you. This concert venue and bar has a great vibe!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been for lunch but the Monday all day happy hour deal is awesome. $2 tacos and they are delish!"}
{"text":"This is a review for brunch  It's only on Sunday but that is just fine with me. This is an inspired by Chris Bianco Mexican brunch worth the 5 stars. It was very reminiscent of the old gallio blanco; good taste travels together?! Food was very fresh service was spot on and the upstairs patio downtown very refreshing."}
{"text":"Service is awesome!! Great food, decent beer selection and rad place to catch good music or drag queen bingo  this place has a good night on lock down !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!"}
{"text":"This must've been an off night for them because I've eaten here and seen shows here before and raved about it to my coworkers afterwards. Service was slow, the kitchen got my wife's order wrong, and my drink (iced tea) didn't make it to my table until after my dinner did, and I had asked two different people for it. My impression was that staff were overwhelmed. Perhaps in the future when the Crescent Ballroom sells out a venue, they should staff a little heavier. On a positive note, my quesadilla was good, and they took my wife's order off the bill."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix needed a larger venue that could accommodate active dancers, puking drinkers, and wallflowers into a room that has a good sound system, year-round temperature control, acoustics, and good promoters.    Thank you Crescent Ballroom.  You saved the day.  Now I don't have to watch Phish in 120 degrees, turning into human bacon, paying too much for a foamy beer that is going to turn into pee water in two minutes.  Oh, and I don't even like the band anyway... because they always play in dusty-outdoor-half-empty amphitheaters with awful sound caused by rattling sheet metal and airplane noise pollution.  So, when a friend asks me,   \"Dude, you want to spend 120 bones to see String Cheese Incident at Mesa Ampitheater?\"     I am going to politely say no and go see Big Freedia from a dark corner in a cool ballroom and drink my delicious whisky and coke that only costs 5 bucks.    This venue is great for the music industry, it's great for the penny pinchers, it's great for the socialites, and it's great for Phoenix.  Charlie Sheen can't win this much with three nostrils."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only not the music venue since we arrived long after they finished. I really liked the vibe of this bar. It was pretty chill and there was a nice patio outside to sit down and relax. Inside, they were showing a movie on the screen but with a DJ playing music. A couple of drunks in there, but not bad enough to ruin the night. It was our last stop on our Friday night and it was a fun way to end it."}
{"text":"Great sound, nicely laid out space, good service, solid beers on tap... This place is a game-changer. The lounge area on the street is awesome, and opens today (and everyday) from four PM till 2 AM. The concert space is great, as well. A knee-high stage has plenty of room for large acts, while in the back of the room, tired/lame attendees can relax in the bleachers. The bathrooms, while boring,  were spotless. We'll see how long that lasts, haha.   I can't WAIT to update this review with more experiences. (ESPECIALLY FOOD!!! Next week!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Awesome venue! Reasonable prices for drinks and the food. Really like the chill vibe and intimate venue. All of the staff are really nice. Definitely see a show here or come to hang out. Army of Darkness was playing on a projector screen. A+"}
{"text":"Have really enjoyed seeing concerts at this venue.  They are now getting the word out that they are open starting at 11am for lunch, delicious guacamole and interesting burritos with locally sourced ingredients.  A nice place to relax over a quick lunch with friends.  They said there are happy hour specials so check back for those."}
{"text":"Man, I was just there last night and I like watching a show here and having a drink. The staff is always pleasant at the least. I haven't tried the food yet but one of my home girls keeps telling me I need to try the food. Next time."}
{"text":"Frankly, I think it's going to be hard to see anyone anywhere else after you see when it's done right. I was able to go to the soft opening of this place, and glad for the experience.  What I liked:  Great sight-lines from anywhere. The stage is a perfect size, height and shape. The room wraps around it. Good sound and lights. There were 10 people playing on stage and no difficulty fitting them on there! The bleacher concept is fab, and I like that some shows will have tables and chairs.  The bartenders, especially KC, were friendly and accommodating. I notice they don't have the pour limiters you see in a lot of bars these days. Kudos.  Front lounge is going to be a fantastic place to hang out even when there isn't a concert, and they're lining up some solid DJs. And food will come from Chris Bianco and Doug Robson? Yikes that's amazing.   I'm so looking forward to my first concert here. Woo-hoo for the Crescent Ballroom!"}
{"text":"$7 Tempranillo, simple munchies $2-$9, great sound, seating, and that's in the lounge. The ballroom wasn't open tonight, but the lounge was great. Non-pretentious,   ultra cool in a not-trying kind of way. Easy to find. Didn't need the bathrooms so can't report on that. Great wine selection and prices for a club. Outdoor patio for smokers. Wait service for the tables, only one person but it worked. Nice place, good sound."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love... Not quite sure, ...no, I'm pretty sure, it's love. I've been looking for this venue. - I just didn't know it, till I arrived.  I've recently just started going to the Crescent Ballroom for local shows, and live music, after hearing about the venue from friends sometime early last year. - I've been to three shows since, with each one better than the one before it.  First of all, it's cozy. It's \"mid-sized\", seating 300-500 people. It's not huge and impersonal like a lot of phoenix venues I've been to. This place has character, and style, and I like the freedom of enjoying a drink (or two) on the patio, while readying for the show to start.  It's seriously one of the best live music venues I've been to. It's great to be able to see a decent show, in a local venue, without all the fuss of a stadium or arena setting.   They have a lounge. This area, separate from the venue's main concourse, is where you can order food and drinks, and is where the tables, patio and bar are located.  Their full-sized bar is staffed with super quick, friendly and knowledgable servers. In addition to your regular bar/venue fair, they also offer a decent selection of house specialty drinks. I've ordered both the honey badger, and the casa blanca, and would highly recommend either to a friend. I definitely intend on returning to try more of their tasty concoctions.  Their Happy Hour is from M-F from 4:30-6pm, which gets you $2 PBR's, $3 well drinks, $3 Drafts or $1 off other drinks.  If you're looking for a fun weekend night out, or a mid-week break from the norm, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile! So happy I finally got the chance to experience all the great things people have been saying. Great food, great margaritas, and a really cool atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love it when i find a great venue with class and style! The Drinks are good the food is great, and there is always some new group that is playing some great music. I have seen some great EDM artist's rock this stage, rocked out with the dry river yacht club at a free concert! They do a lot of free shows all the time, and you can catch some live music just about anytime you find your way into this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is my go-to for just about everything. Food. Drinks. Shows. It's a great venue to meet up with a friend for lunch, grab drinks, or see a show. Their carne asada is the best."}
{"text":"Great place. My buddy beef vegan from Kwss 106.7 FM hosted a cd release party for Mergence, an the kongos.  My first time there. Place has a great vibe, very good prices on drinks. It was a little hot in there but I guess that's to be expected with so many people watching a Show.   All in all, I'd totally go back."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. It would be a cool venue in any city, but considering it is the the entertainment wasteland that is Phoenix, the Crescent Ballroom is exceptional.  Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?  All of these great elements make Crescent Ballroom a shining star in Cen Pho. In a town where venue after venue is shutting down, I couldn't be happier that this place is thriving."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour drinks and eats. Heard about the nachos and couldn't wait to try them. Was not disappointed! Adding carne asada was only a few bucks more and easily shared. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"First let me say thank you to Stateside Presents for creating a music venue, in the heart of downtown Phoenix!  I was ecstatic to hear of this venue and when I went to my first show there, I was happy it lived up to all the hype.  I love the bleacher style seating in the back, for those shows you don't feel like standing at...genius idea.  Everything about this place, is the perfect size.  Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, and Doug Robson, of Gallo Blanco (located in the Clarendon Hotel) oversee the menu here and they offer some vegan options, so it is an automatic win in my opinion!  Not a huge menu, but it is just enough.  You can eat, have a few drinks and then head in to the ballroom for the show....makes for a nice evening.  And when there isn't a show happening, it is open for business as usual and DJ's are spinning some of your favorite tunes.  All in all, I dig this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We went here when the VIG told us they stopped serving at 11PM.  The street Tacos were good as were a couple of other things we had.   And yes, like the other guy said, get the Bag of Donuts.  But, if you re easily offended by loud music that describes sex acts this is not the place for you.   And if you are a woman that is offended by music that describes you in a less than positive light this place is not for you either."}
{"text":"Ok..so I have worked in the neighborhood for 5 years but only recently started frequenting this place for lunch. The food is good. Period. Sonoran dog, carne as asada, al pastor, bean and cheese burrito. All good. Salsa good. What else do you need? Prices reasonable. Done."}
{"text":"Out with a friend I hadn't seen in 10 years and he brought us to this place for some late night eats. I got the guacamole and chips and hubby got two tacos (al pastor and carne asada). Guac was excellent but the chips could use more salt IMO. Hubby liked the al pastor but the carne asada \"tasted weird\". Server took it back without hesitation and swapped it for a second al pastor, leaving all parties super stoked. They also happened to have the beers that everyone drinks on the reg so BONUS. Service was EXCELLENT and the music scene here seemed like it had something for everyone. There was a DJ setting up while we ate in the dining room, a metal band was playing in the back room and slow jams on the patio. Super chill door staff and servers. Clean, well stocked, gender-neutral bathrooms. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The best in booking shows in Phoenix, no contest.   The venue is set up really well. The lighting tends to be low but other than that pretty good. Always clean. Nice smoking patio.   The restaurant is good but they could offer some less expensive options-- it is a venue after all.   The sound is hit or miss, it tends to be bass heavy and blows out the other instruments. They tend to not care much about mixing for local or supporting bands unfortunately.  The wait staff is nice. The security is the worst only second to The Marquee. I probably went there 2-3'x a week for a year before anyone in that place even began to remember me. Others of my friends have been harassed about their ID's which was totally bogus. Other venues seem to make an effort to know their regular customers . This place seems like they couldn't care less -- it comes across as pretentiousness. For this reason I'll give them a 3 instead of a 4. Embrace your community that pays to keep money in your pockets and your doors open."}
{"text":"AMAZING CONCERT VENUE. I have never been here before and have been all over the valley to most other venues. Came here to see Betty Who on Monday night. The venue is amazing. It's smaller and a much more intimate experience with fans and artists. Ticket prices vary but aren't as outrageous as other venues with sky rocketed fees. $20 was all we paid per ticket. The place has 2 full bars with decently priced cocktails and cheap beers. It's standing room general admission with a \"bleacher\" style seating towards the back of the venue. The show was 16+ but they had a special section for the underage crowd that was up front side stage so they could enjoy too. The venue is great especially if an artist you really like is playing and you want a more personal fan based experience."}
{"text":"What a totally cool place! We went last night to see a concert, I had never been there. Parking was easy, parking lots all over the place down there. The venue was ventilated well, not too smoky. If you choose to get there early, you can claim a seat on the wooden bleachers. Or arrive anytime and stand during the music. We stood, no big deal. Bar was well stocked, great beers, wine, etc. Prices beyond fair. Sound quality was fine. Just a really cool place! We'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here to see The Soft Moon and to eat tacos! The tacos were pretty dang good. They were fresh and served very quickly. Out of the selection we had the pork (al pastor), tinga chicken and fish tacos. Their beer selection if above average. Only complaint is they serve their drinks in plastic cups. This imparts a weird taste, in my humble opinion.  The staff we encountered were all very nice and accommodating. The venue itself is intimate, but the sound system was good and didn't distort the sound. For $10 to see a national act + two opening acts (which I was assuming were local kids) it was a good value. I really wish we had something like this in SW Colorado. I would not hesitate to make the 7.5 hour drive to this venue again."}
{"text":"This is the venue you go to when you graduate from being almost trampled to death by 16-year-olds at Marquee Theater. Love, love, LOVE this place. The ballroom is fabulous. It has great acoustics, it doesn't get groggy and hot, the bathrooms are always clean, and the bar is a nice size - I've never had to wait behind two rows of people trying to grab a drink during a show. There's a \"pit\" area as well as stadium bench seating and no matter where you choose to sit/stand you can both see and hear perfectly well - something I as a petite 5'3\" girl can really appreciate.  I also love the restaurant half of the place. It's a great during-the-week hang out to grab a few cocktails and watch an acoustic set in the dining area. The food is surprisingly delicious - I had the bean & cheese burro w/ veggies. Sounds like nothing special but the toasted tortilla and smokey, creamy chipotle salsa really had me feeling better about spending $8 on a bean and cheese burrito. And it's an added bonus (for me at least) that they have churros for dessert. Can't beat cinnamon & sugar fried bread dipped in cajeta (thick caramel sauce made from goat's milk). SO GOOD.  Affordable shows (with some really great lineups) , good food, and booze. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The Wife took me here for a Date Night to see her band ZZ Ward and have a few drinks. We both really enjoyed the ease and simplicity of the whole experience. Parking is right out back for around $5. Tickets for the show were $15 each and both the drinks and food were very affordable and tasty.  Inside has a small lounge up front where you can enjoy some good eats and drinks. You can even hear the bands playing in certain areas without getting a ticket. There is also a small patio that you can use if you need to light one up or just get some fresh air.  The bands are in the middle section and it is a rather large area. Most of the people listening are standing up by the stage and you can move around wherever you want to go. There are also some bleachers along the wall if want to listen sitting down. Really like the cool bar area in the back when you need a quick refill and the easy access bathrooms when it is time to go. Nice!  This particular show was sold out and packed to the rim. Even with a full crowd it was still a very enjoyable event. The sound is pretty amazing no matter where you listen. It does have a tendency to get pretty loud at times so you may want to bring some ear plugs as an option.  Get there early so you can goof off and work on your buzz. The music can go for a few hours depending on the length of the sets and who is playing. We both ordered the giant Lalo Guerrrero Burger to soak up some suds before the main act and it was delicious.  Don't tell the wife but I thought ZZ Ward was really CUTE and could easily be my new Yelp Current Crush. Definitely will be back for another show soon. Check online for tickets and schedules. COOL MAN!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night after the Florence and the Machine concert. First of all I LOVE this place as a concert venue. Exactly what you need, small and intimate but good acoustics and atmosphere. Also I personally hate going to shows and feeling like the old guy (im only 27) but it seems like some of these indie shows are full of highschoolers. At crescent, they kind of separate that, so I can not feel so old. thanks.  Anyway, it was 4/20 so they had free cover. We went right to the bar and got some waters (it was HOT) and beer, and a gin/tonic. All were reasonably priced in a small plastic cup. In order to go into the venue area we had to pay a $5 cover. The band this time was a Nirvana cover band, Im all for nirvana but this band...yikes. Thats okay though, the crowd was great and I definitely recommend coming here to grab drinks in the front room area, hang with friends, or even see a show. Crescent has AWESOME shows that come to it so I am definitely going to check this place out. ALSO the Burritos, i tried some from my friend, and dang. That thing is good. Definitely recommend getting a burrito here. The prices range from about $6-8. The one I tried was bean and cheese with Tillamook cheese which I love. Anyway, good crowd, decent drinks, and AWESOME concert venue. Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a great venue!  Saw Charli XCX there last week and it was my first time.  It is REALLY easy to get a drink and they make good drinks.  There's a cordoned off area in front of the stage that is accessible to anyone not currently in possession of alcohol.  There are bleacher-style seats in back if your tootsies get tired.  And FOOD (real food - not concession food) available.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came here to see a show and have dinner before it. We just ordered tacos and it took them 45 mins to bring it out. It was busy but wow that's crazy. It was good atmosphere and trivia was fun."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night and there was no cover for ladies.  This is a nice place if you want to actually talk and hang out with friends rather than club. They do have a DJ at night on weekends but it's more calmer music than top 40 or EDM. There's a second floor which takes you up to a  terrance with some views.   The drink prices were fair. Beer on tap was $5.   If you want to go out but also relax and unwind, then this is your place. If you want to go all out and get your dance on, then it probably isn't. Head to Bar Smith or Sky Lounge instead.  Also, Cresent Ballroom is a music venue during the day, their schedule for shows is on their website prices for shows is anywhere from free to $40, so it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"My favorite small music venue in Phoenix! Great place to catch Phoenix live local music."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat while downtown.  They have the best salsa and tacos!  I get the burrito bowls almost every time."}
{"text":"Small, intimate venue for shows/concerts in the middle of downtown. The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of \"stadium\" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They have great burritos and amazing tacos. I saw Russ Liquid Test in the music venue part and the bar was super fast and right next to the stage to you don't miss anything.   I've been here five or six times and at night they have cool videos on the projector screen and I would highly recommend ordering the honey badger..   It's Jameson, bitters, and ginger beer.. epic.   Check this place out"}
{"text":"Great venue for live concerts!  I haven't eaten here, but I've seen a few shows.  The space is great--room to move, to sit, to people watch.  I know that people have mixed feelings about the bleachers at the back of the space, but I liked them.  They aren't intrusive, and they give you a place to sit down when you need it.  It wasn't particularly crowded for either show I saw, but the place isn't big, so that could be an issue.  A great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"I would normally rate Crescent 5 stars, but not tonight. We went early, as we normally do in order to have dinner and a few drinks before the concert. Tonight, 3/4 of the tables had reserved signs on them. We were rudely told that there was a 20 top coming in (scattered among 4 tables ?!?!?) Why is Crescent allowing reservations for a party that big on the night of a sold out show? Not the smartest call if you ask me. Others were trying to grab a bite before the show and were out of luck. Extremely irritating night at the Crescent."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is a cool spot to hang out and check out some live music or to just chill and have some good Mexican food from Cocina 10, enjoy some drinks, and play whatever game that might be going on (trivia, bingo, etc).  They've got good indoor, patio, balcony seating, and bar seating with1-2TVs.  The staff are cool and there are good happy hour & daily specials.  The nachos are great, tacos, n the bean n cheese burritos are huge.  I'm sure other items are great as well- just haven't tried them."}
{"text":"Loved this venue! Definitely a great little intimate place to hear live music and up and coming bands. The staff are all really friendly and the room has good acoustics for the type and scale of performers brought to stage. The only thing that felt a little weird were the bleachers in the back... It did feel a little high school gymnasium, BUT it also created seating for a lot more people. So functionally, the bleachers were great; aesthetically, not so much.  The drinks were also reasonably priced.  Didn't try the food, but the churros that came by smelled great!  I'll def look for another event here."}
{"text":"The Croissant Ballroom is a secret bakery/nightclub/speakeasy on Portland St.   The password to get in is located somewhere in the book Ulysses by James Joyce.  Good Luck 2 u"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their Alex & Sierra concert that happened on February 28, 2017.   When we first got there, parking was everywhere so you can basically find parking anywhere since it next to ASU downtown campus. We were greeted very friendly by the staff who took our tickets. A line was form outside of the venue and for those who are under 21 will be escorted to the back of the venue who gets to go in first. The venue is so nice and very well organized. They had benches for people who didn't want to stand. I didn't have time to try their food but heard great reviews about it-will definitely give it a try another time.   The concert went great and didn't have any issues!"}
{"text":"I'm going to take a break from my Yelping hiatus to talk about a relatively new venue that has become near and dear to my heart.  The Crescent Ballroom has become the single greatest concert venue in Phoenix.  Charlie Levy has become my indie god, as he's brought more concerts that I've been stoked about than I could ever imagine in such a short period of time.  The acoustics are perfect, the tickets are nothin', and you can get yo drink on with anything ranging from PBR to handmade gourmet concoctions.  Thank you Crescent!!"}
{"text":"Great sound, great crowds, good beers and good food. THE music venue in phoenix. Have been here many times for bands, will continue coming back."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for a couple years. Usually show up at night for dancing. Its always random one night its rock, another its hip hop, another its trance/dance. I love the change of beats.  Dress code is whatever you want. I've gone after a wedding (suit attire) other times I've gone with just jeans and a t shirt. Just as long as your positive than this is a nice place to hang out.  Last Saturday I decided to go early 6pm. None stop chips with red and green salsa. Chicken Burrito is stuffed with ingredients. Flamenco show.  This venue is awesome day or night, drink and food."}
{"text":"Be prepared to have an amazing burrito and be charged $1.00 per cup of alcohol that you ask \"on the rocks\". Overcharged for nothing. Mediocre service. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"Whether you're coming here for lunch, dinner, or a show, this place is great! First there is the food. TACOS! Do you love tacos? The answer is yes, and the solution to lack of tacos in your life is Crescent. The bean dip with chips is also very delicious.   If you're here to see a show then you're gonna have a great time. The venue is intimate and you can see the stage from anywhere in the room. There is a bar inside the ballroom that is quick to get you a drink so you can get back to dancing the night away. The staff here is amazing and know how to run a busy venue.   I love coming here and I am excited for the new venue the owners are opening across the street."}
{"text":"For A small club. It's very user friendly. Great staff. Street parking. Old and young. Everyone feels welcome."}
{"text":"Crescent is the best Venue in town. Ive seen so many amazing artist at Crescent. They have a great food menu and can back it up with flavor. They also are always staffed well for busy nights. If you get a chance go on a 90's dance party night it is the most fun. Ive been to Crescent so many times and I cant say Ive ever had a bad time."}
{"text":"What a great venue! I love the intimate feel at Crescent. I've seen many, many groups perform here and have always appreciated the laid back vibe, as well as the opportunity to get to know the musicians at the merch table after the show.   I was last here about a month ago for the Moth Storytelling Event. 5/5 stars. We had a fabulous time! The audience was charged up, the storytellers were electrifying, and the hostess built fabulous community throughout the entire evening. I tried the food at Crescent for the first time- a beef burrito and a rice pudding. Both were promptly on time and delicious, as well as reasonably priced!   Thank you, Crescent Ballroom, for a great night! I can't wait to be back this coming month!"}
{"text":"Great music , drinks and food. Even though I didn't see the show that night, the place screams, \"why aren't there more places like this in downtown Phoenix!\"   Best thing, it's less the two blocks off the Van Buren light rail stop!!  Will keep going!"}
{"text":"Excellent location with a very nice roof top. I had the chicken enchiladas. Very good presentation, the chicken was slightly dry and the tortilla a little stale. Rice and beans that came with the meal were excellent. The staff was very good and friendly. I'd recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"A great new venue! We really needed a new music venue here, and Crescent Ballroom really delivers. Great sound quality- I saw Washed Out last night and it couldn't have sounded better."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite venue in Phx. Great place to get your groove on.   Saw Nightmares on Wax here a couple months ago and had a great time per usual. The small space makes for a more intimate experience with the artist. DJ EASE literally kissed my hand at the end of their set. Swoon."}
{"text":"Usually it's a chill place but the bartender was a bit rude and tip reflects on your service"}
{"text":"I've been to Crescent several times, but on this last visit, I noticed just how old I am.   I literally could not handle the sound level of the music. My first move was to rummage through my purse to see if there was anything to stick in my ears. For some reason, I actually had ear plugs in my purse. I guess when you turn 30, you just start carrying crap like that around. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in. So our second move, was to go outside on the patio. When people started smoking around us, we were forced back inside ... because smelling like smoke is now something I avoid like the plague. Then we sat on a bench and decided that if we were just going to sit there and talk to each other, we might as well go home.   Now that is sad.   I would definitely recommend this place to see a band, but for the love of God, the music in the front room is so loud it hurts. It's just not worth the hearing damage.   Yes, I turned 31 last month."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Crescent Ballroom.  It is an amazing venue to watch a show.  The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there a couple of hours before the show to eat dinner and have cocktails, but when we wanted to go into the show, we had to exit the restaurant and get in line.  I don't understand why they can't scan our tickets from the inside and give us bracelets there.  Other than this issue I would recommend seeing a show there anytime you have a chance."}
{"text":"Lola burger and honey badger.  Best burger ever, and best combo if you're a fan of whiskey ginger. This is a lovely artsy spot and must-go-to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here last night for their 90s hip hop night! It was my friend's birthday and we all dressed up in 90s attire and came to Crescent to dance our hearts out! Crescent Ballroom has lots of great shows and if you love music, you should definitely make a visit! :) Since there are regular shows, you can expect a cover charge. Last night it was $5 per person. Some shows with popular artists actually have tickets so be sure to check out their website before going to make sure that you're prepared ahead of time!   It can get pretty packed but the bars always have multiple bartenders and they're usually pretty on top of the crowd! I also love that they have music videos and movies playing on the walls, it creates such a fun vibe. It is the perfect place in Downtown Phoenix to come with a group and/or celebrate a special occasion! I know that we'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I was visting Phoenix from Chicago and this was the place that all the locals were telling me to check out.  I will say that I am glad that I did check it out.  Although I only checked out the lounge area.  There was a local act in the main room, asking $25 for admission.  Sorry... that's a little steep for one guy on an acoustic guitar.  So the lounge it was.  The lounge area is pretty sparse, which works.  Just tables and chairs.  Apparently a DJ plays later, but we left a little before midnight an still no DJ.  Oh well, maybe next time.  One suggestion, get another bathroom.  Having to wait behind a line of 5 girls is never a good thing."}
{"text":"How did it take me so long to get here? Great place to see a show, or just stop in for a bite to eat and a drink.  I came for a show - we got a table near the front. Acoustics were good, drinks were fairly priced (I can't gripe about $5/pint anywhere - at a show, it's great!), and the staff were friendly.  Tip - one block west of the venue has no parking meters!  It was a fantastic night out with a great group of women - and I will definitely be back - this is a great little venue!"}
{"text":"Ive had mixed service from this place. It was a blast on new years, but i had my pocket picked twice and caught a girl once. Tried to get me while waiting in line for the restroom.   Ive had to wait 2 hours for food with 3 other friends, while our waitress did god knows what. She certainly didnt serve us or bother checking on us, only when we stopped her.   We were promised a brewery tour for winning Phoenix Phued, which we've yet been able to reach anyone about. Its been atleast a month and no one will return our email, as we were instructed to email them.  The sonoran dog, and burritos are delicious, the games are fun, the bartenders were alright, i just wish i had more good things to say.  I rate this a 2.5 to 3."}
{"text":"Love the Crescent great music good drinks awesome crowd.. one of my favorite spots to go to in the downtown area..  would definitely suggest this place for anyone looking for something to do.. live music and good crowd"}
{"text":"This is my spot! I come here quite often. Cheap drinks, fun & friendly staff. Just don't be a drunk douchebag and they won't mess with you. It's simple."}
{"text":"Phoenix has a dearth of good music venues.  When Crescent Ballroom opened up, I heard great things.  I finally had the opportunity to see a show there.  My first impression was great.  There is seating in the back if you need to rest, the place is intimate, the acoustics seemed good... In fact, it was great until people started showing up.  The problem with Crescent is the scene.  If you want to hang out and chat (loudly) with a bunch of hipsters, it's probably the place for you.  If, however, you are there to actually listen to a live band, good luck hearing the slow songs over all the chatter.  The parking situation is also pretty annoying.  You really do need exact change, and there's no other obvious place to park nearby with an actual parking attendant.  In all fairness, it's really a decent little venue.  The live music is just unfortunately secondary to the social scene."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to see a show here, but I can't wait to.  Talking with the employees, it will be a sight to be seen.  That said, there are many shows upcoming that have my interest, and I look forward to it.  I stayed for a few drinks.  They were all palatable and correct.  The decor is great - I really appreciate the handmade stuff.  The selection is pretty decent, though beers I'd say is average at best.  Being a beer person, I'm glad there's one decent pale+ here, but nothing more than that (that it's on tap helps a bit).  Somewhere around 20 beers total, four on tap, but the craft selection is a little lacking.  This happens to be a place I can order something with St. Germain though, and to me, stands out a bit.  Prices weren't crazy over the top, nor spectacular.  I imagine after food is regularly served here, the need for a happy hour will deplete (thus, I am not mentioning the very slow attendance and need for happy hour pricing).  The idea of a great drink, food and music venue is so long overthought, that I think Phoenix has pretty much forgotten about it.  Finally, after so many years of wishing, someone has guts to go ahead and do it.  I got some sampling of the soon-to-be fare, and I obviously have no qualms.  The genius behind the upcoming food here is nothing to scoff at.  The music lineup seems quite eclectic, but overall tasteful and good; I can't wait to see a show here and experience it at its fullest.  From DJs to indies.  My one qualm (as with many, many other places) is the TV, and apparent need for sports playing.  I have a major aversion to sports in a bar setting.  It removes the awkwardness of silence, therefor fueling anti-socialism (where if there was no TV, the awkwardness would be filled with conversation).  Overall: this place seems like it will become what we have been asking for over the last many years.  Already I can tell it has an aura of greatness.  Let's hope they keep it up, and retain their premier."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is a wonderful venue for music and lunch downtown.  St. Vincent, Phantogram, and Eliot Sumner are some of the artists I've been fortunate to see at this intimate venue.  If you're not one to crowd towards the front of the stage there's also bleacher style seating in the back that also has a great view.  Tickets are fairly priced and sometimes you can snag a free ticket if you grab lunch on a Tuesday.  Best time to beat the Tuesday lunch rush is either at 11:30am or after 1pm.  I recommend the tacos for lunch or Happy Hour.  For a bit of subtle heat try the Tinga Taco. No heat? Try the Pacific Chicken Taco.    I've received tickets to three separate events from Ticket Tuesday thus far:). It's a great way to sample the menu."}
{"text":"Bands, DJs, musicians, art and even some Lucha Libre wrestling every now and again, this is an excellent venue to experience music and entertainment. With an intimate setting, seating is limited to bleachers or standing room, but please don't be tempted to sit on the bottom bleacher, you won't be able to see the stage over the crowd standing in front of you.  Crescent ballroom is hands down, one of my favorite music venues in town. They get well known touring musicians as well as unknown local bands playing on this stage and there seems to be something exciting every night of the week. I've seen Macy Gray play here, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Judith Hill, and CeeLo Green to name a few. I highly suggest finding them on Facebook and following their feed. It's the most effective way to keep up with the shows coming across their stage.   Drinks are available at two bars in this venue during most shows and the bathrooms behind the bar in the concert hall is usually much shorter of a wait than the one in the dining hall. I've not had the food here, but that's usually because I've already eaten, but I hear it's pretty good!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, go out, catch a show and have an awesome time! :-)"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed coming here to watch Highly Suspect. The venue was great for live music... and small so it was intimate so you could feel like you are getting an extra special experience. i also very much enjoyed the bar area. The bartenders were quick, friendly, the patrons were young and hip, but also friendly and happy to share a table at it's peak busy hours and the drinks were reasonably priced. $5 for a well cocktail on a Saturday night, while it's packed during a rad show? I'll take it! thanks for the good time, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"we went to the cresent ballroom for a railroad earth show on my husband's birthday.  parking was relatively easy to find down the street, so that was a plus.  there was a bar/dining area in the front, and then the main ballroom where the show was. it fit a lot of people. i believe there are seats you could have paid for that are bench style if you're not for standing up at a concert.  the only thing i wasn't super stoked about was that the patio allowed smokers and it wafted into the bar area."}
{"text":"Crescent is one of my favorite venues in the Phoenix area.  They host a large variety of shows and the staff is all very friendly.  They've recently expanded out the patio areas and it's helped a great deal in alleviating the cramped feeling you could get.    The only negative thing I can really say about this place is the bathroom situation.  Make sure to stand in line for a bathroom before you need to go."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have heard about trivia night so we decided to check it out. The trivia portion of the night was a lot of fun. As we played we ordered the chips and salsa and a side of guacamole, which were average; my fiancé got the sangria, which was really good; and I ordered their house beer (Lucha Libre Lager), who was alright nothing special just your run of the mill American lager. BUT our waitress was awful, ruined our experience. On the crescent website the promotion for trivia night includes $1 chips and salsa and the side of guacamole is $3 according to the menu. We got the check and we were charged $3 for the chips and $8.50 for the guacamole, I asked about it and our waitress said I brought you out a full portion, you ate it all and now you have to pay for it. I told her all we ordered was a side of guac and she said the same thing again. And for the chips, I showered her the website and she told us that the website is wrong. I asked to see a manager and there was none to be found according to her and one other waitress. We would have come back for trivia night and other events all the time cause we loved the atmosphere but sadly the waitress killed everything and we probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to see concerts in Phoenix.  The sound is almost always exceptional and there are things going on every night.  Nice floor space and great elevated seating in back."}
{"text":"It's pretty much Mexican fare.  Everything we tried here was delicious!  We had nachos which was a pretty nice portion.  I ordered a chicken burrito that came grilled.  The prices were a tiny bit high but if they can consistently serve up good food I'd definitely be back.  They didn't even have a band there at the time I went!  Going back for a concert next!"}
{"text":"I've been here for several shows and the sound is great. Also love that it is a fairly intimate venue. It's also not a bad idea to get to the show early to check out Cocina 10's happy hour for great deals on amazing food such as their fish tacos. Super nice employees. As an ASU student I can park for free with my permit in an ASU lot nearby."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is completely the best venue in all of Arizona! I have seen a bunch of bands here and always had an amazing time. No matter where you're standing in the concert area you will have a good view and it is easy to get by the stage which is always awesome! The best part is that you can hang out during or after any show at the front bar and there are always cool people to meet and talk to. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Finally, a music venue in Phoenix that encourages local bands as well as national acts. Intimate feel and \"Smells like Team Spirit\" bleachers and wait for it, AWESOME BATHROOMS, ladies don't wait in ridiculous lines any longer! Perfect to light rail too, so convenient. Can't say anything bad about Crescent! Now I hear they are doing FREE Sundays in Summer, super bad."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. I only had an hour. My friend and I ordered as soon as we got there. 47 minutes later we asked about our food and the waitress said it had just been put in 7 minutes ago. She forgot to put it in!!! I was very disappointed!!!! It was my fist time going there and I don't think I will ever go back. They didn't offer us anything and hesitated to appolagize, she tried to blame us for their mistake!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix from San Francisco specifically for a show at the Crescent Ballroom - and what an awesome venue.   Love the outdoor seating and the drinks were great. They poured hefty servings of Glenlivet 12 and their Crescent Crush house cocktail - their take on a Greyhound - and served in a pint glass was dangerously delicious.   The ballroom was perfect - small and loud.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is a huge success for downtown Phoenix. The setup is surely to be copied (hopefully) by other Arizona venues. The bar makes real cocktails and is affordable. The mexican street-style food is delicious and decent quantities. The venue looks nice where it counts and keeps it minimal for a good show room. The size of the entire venue keeps things intimate but has enough room not to be unrealistic like a lot of places in downtown, phx. The sound from the few shows I have been to have all been well done."}
{"text":"The wife and I were staying in Phoenix for the Vikings/Cardinals game this week and were looking for something to do after a disappointing Viking's loss.  How lucky was I that the Roadway Inn was two blocks away from this little secret gem?  We got a little appetizer type sampling of food with some amazing guacamole and a super good bean and cheese burrito.  I was also a huge fan of the Coronado Water (tequila, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, and soda water).  It was very refreshing and tasty.    The relaxed vibe at this place was also just what we were looking for.  Good music being played, friendly staff, and some old skate videos on the tv's. They also have live music many nights a week.  I was surprised to see Finch was playing there soon.  It would be a cool place to see bands because it is pretty small and intimate.  A must visit if in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Three words: BAG OF DONUTS! It doesn't matter if you are full or not, get them as dessert, you will not be disappointed.   Ate here before Highly Suspect concert. Hubby got hot dog, it was good, not great. I got salmon salad. I hate...no...loath cilantro, so I was not a happy gal! It is drenched in cilantro dressing. Salmon was great though. If you worship cilantro you will like it.   Great beer selection too.   As for concert venue, I loved it and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to the Crescent Ballroom a couple times but I've only seen one show. Let me tell you how it played out... and therefore why you should go.   Through my typical dumb luck, which I am blessed to have in spades, I was able to get tickets to a show on this particular night that I needed them.   I showed up late and what do you know, I walked down and took someone's seat in the front row.   The singer, a blonde woman, age unknown, is like \"I'm gonna free style. I hope you don't mind.\" So, of course, the crowd goes wild without knowing what's coming.   And she starts sing a Toby Lightman song:  \"Did I see you winkin' or is that me thinkin'?  Should I show affection to the guy in the front row?  Did I see you smile 'cause you been here for a while  Should I make a connection with the guy in the front row?   \"But you don't know where I'm from, where I belong All you know is my name And you only know what you see and that really isn't me But I'm glad you came  DALLAS here again interrupting my own story:  Now I'm thinking, is this a coincidence or am I the guy in the front row? Cause, you know, I'm the fricken guy in the front row.   Ok back to the story:  Her still singing...  \"Are you makin' passes while I'm pleasin' the masses?  Well, I know all about you, you're the guy in the front row  AND THEN I SWEAR SHE LOOKS AT ME! WINKS. SHE WINKS! I of course am bright red and embarrassed.   \"Are you trying to distract me, while you're tying to attract me? But I what to do, about you in the front row\"  OK... So here's the part you're all hoping for... my emotional devastation.   She finishes the song in which she say's she's glad \"I\" came... Asks lyrically if \"I\" want to hang... and at the end... She's like come here, guy in the front row.   She wags her finger in the exact way you want a relatively attractive woman to wag her finger and I get up... and she bursts out laughing hysterically... and she can't stop. She's like dying of laughter. That fucking bitch is crying laughing at the stage and everyone saw me get up... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.   She was fricking wagging her damned finger at the guy next to me... who like got up and smelled her knee. I'm sure she would have made out with him but she was still laughing.   So anyway, if you want THAT kind of relationship with the artists. That's what you get. you can like see their cloven hooves if they're devil women like her. Or whatever.   It's quite literally the best place in town to see a show or be the show and get seen or watch trendy people in their natural habitat."}
{"text":"Bouncer ignored my legal 22 year old ID and forced me to watch the show in the segregated under 21 section where it was difficult to receive any service. Food was good when it finally came."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Crescent's bean & cheese burrito. Plenty of booze to choose from, great vibe and there's always something going on here. Guacamole and chips are from another planet, SO DELICIOUS. Jessica is the best server here, no doubt. Venue wise, Crescent is the best in the valley. The sound is incomparable, and it's a very \"intimate\" setting, ya dig?"}
{"text":"Finally downtown has a great music venue and Crescent Ballroom could not have done a better job. From the staff to the lighting on the stage, this place is perfect! I am extremely excited about CB and the upcoming schedule with tons of great bands in store for us."}
{"text":"Absolutely great venue to see a show!  I attended a private party Thursday night with Edwin McCain as the performer and was so impressed.  The food was good, the space was really nice and intimate for a show and the staff seemed great!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight after a concert at Comerica. We got there at 11:45p. Well before closing time. We had the \"security\" midget tell us that we couldn't come inside. And then he changed his mind after a few seconds. Maybe because he realized that he couldn't by law deny us entry to the restaurant. Since they have to legally serve all patrons. We ordered food. Simple. Two tacos, bean dip and two drinks. Meanwhile, they are closing up all around us. Making us feel extremely uncomfortable and kicking everyone out that is hanging out on the patio. We decide to eat our food quickly since we are made to feel like we are an inconvenience. I have my cup of ice. Which is my old drink. I step outside with my cup. I have the midget security come out, knock my cup of ice out of my hand, and tells me that I'm costing the venue their liquor license. It's because of people like me that he can't be nice. He did me a favor by letting us in. Really?? He continues to talk shit to me until he walks away. Worst experience ever. And I have been coming to this venue since it opened. But apparently now they have dumb midgets as security guards. It's laughable."}
{"text":"Very fun, upbeat place to hang out with a group of friends!  I've actually had a couple of friends perform at Crescent Ballroom, and hear that most other performers/shows end up being pretty entertaining as well.  Service and food were so-so, but didn't take away from the overall experience. Looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"This was great Mexican food without all of the dishes being loaded down with sauces. The menu was short and simple and the atmosphere was very hip. This is great place for locals or tourist like ourselves."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great venue! Absolutely love Crescent Ballroom. I saw CSS there last Tuesday, and everything about the event was top notch.  Crescent Ballroom is a decently sized venue. It was intimate enough to get close to the artists, but big enough to where you didn't feel like everyone was stepping on your toes. The bar and bartenders are great. The separate lounge area is very cool. Nice ambiance. Bathrooms were clean. All the employees were friendly. I'll definitely be back. I definitely would like to try the food too."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove up from Tucson on Saturday, March 8 to see Railroad Earth. We got there early enough to eat, and the food was great and deserves four stars. However, once we were inside the performance area, those four stars evaporated. The small concert space was overcrowded, filled with hot, sweaty bodies. We couldn't move around at all, the acoustics were pretty bad, and we finally gave up and left before the set break. I've seen RRE before and I'll see them again. But whoever booked them into this sardine can sized venue made a serious mistake. The place supposedly holds 550 people. Clearly that many, if not more, were in attendance. I've been going to shows for 40 years and I can honestly say that this was THE WORST venue I've ever been to. If I'm in downtown Phoenix again, I might stop for the tacos and beer. But as for music, the Crescent Ballroom was just too crowded! So, food is 4 stars, the venue is zero stars, so averaging them together I come up with two stars. We'll never go back to the Crescent, in all honesty. It's not worth the drive from Tucson."}
{"text":"As my girl and I leave Gilbert in search of some live music we head all the way downtown to check out C.B. TOTALLY worth the trip and glad we made the journey. So nice to see a live music venue that isn't a total dive.  Great crowd,  great food and our server was knowledgable THANKS LAUREN!  Glad to see the live music scene is 100% dead in this valley. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night to see VNV Nation.  Without a doubt, this is the nicest venue which I've been to in the Phoenix Valley.  They serve alcohol.  They have lots of good alcohol.  They have lots of different beers.  The bartenders actually made good drinks.  This is especially important to me because it seems that the other venues either don't serve alcohol or they only have a small selection, most of which is garbage.  There is also a bar with multiple bartenders ~50 feet from the stage!  Atmosphere is very nice.  They did an excellent job planning the acoustics and the sound system.  The sound was fantastic.  Regarding the bathrooms, my wife actually approved, which is a first for her.  Another perk -- they have raised seating (benches?) along the back wall.  The only con -- it was wicked hot by the end of the show ... and it's only the end of March."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Saturday and it had a decent crowd. I like the small patio where you can enjoy the great Phoenix weather. The location is good too - in downtown near a lot of the sports venues etc."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming to this venue. Events here are always reasonably priced and the space is just the perfect size."}
{"text":"Only been here once for the Portland Cello Project, but it was great! The venue itself is understated, but very comfortable. Bleacher seating inside and general standing space. The front area is a lounge and restaurant. Dimly lit. The age group the night we were there was diverse. Definitely a hipster hangout, but if you can look past that, it's a nice hangout. The size of the venue is appropriate for lesser known, indie groups and smaller projects. Definitely looking forward to going to more shows here!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix for the first time and I wanted some good tacos from a local spot. I read about this place on Yelp and gave them a try. It was a unique spot with a cool atmosphere. The menu had a bunch of things that sounded good. I got the barbacoa and my girlfriend got mix and match tacos. We were both blown away and pleased with the service as well. The hot sauces we awesome too. Definitely recommend this spot"}
{"text":"I saw a really great show here with my girlfriend and friend.  The venue itself, I think, has too many bizarre rules and they are pretty disorganized.  Going to take a piss, I'd just bought a beer and, hey, I kinda like pissing with a beer.  It's fun!  Above the urinals they have these metal deals that are perfect for setting a drink on, in fact I can't think of a single other application in which they might come in handy.  As I walk in, this security dude goes, \"Hey!  You can't bring your beer in there,\" and I'm like, \"Well, I'm gonna set it down right here, then...\" when I came out, fuck, my beer was gone and so was the security dude.  Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...  Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.  The venue itself is fine, in terms of set up.  It could stand to be bigger, because this fucker gets packed to the gills, and apparently it gets ten times more packed than it was when I saw it."}
{"text":"A great place to see a show or just grab a bite to eat and a drink.  I love their Bean Burrito although they have plenty of other great items that is my go to.  I've seen The Melvins, Hanni El Khatib, Naughty By Nature, and Coolio here.  Every night at Crescent is an adventure and sure to please.  Great staff and local ownership make this a great place any night of the week.  1 block from a light rail stop makes it easy to visit."}
{"text":"Went there last night . We had an event there and after setting equipment up we had some extra time. So we sat on the patio and watched the world go by. Just ordered the chips and guacamole along with ice tea. Best guac ever. Pieces of tomato and orange made it. Waiter was super. Very a-tentative, consistently refilled our glasses without asking. Mens room was spotless. The Happy Hour menu prices were very cheap!!"}
{"text":"What to eat.... Anything! It's all delicious. Before a show, get a burrito. I have had all of them. You can't go wrong. After a show, get nachos! They are killer. In fact, I'm going to get them after Twin Sister this week. I recommend getting to a show early to get a bite to eat and to get a good spot inside. It seems that most people arrive later to shows.  What to drink... Honey Badger! So delicious and does the trick. Honey bourbon and ginger beer. YUM.   What to see.. Any show is amazing in the ballroom... So far I have seen; CSS, tUnE yArDs, Starfucker, and Poolside. I have tickets for Twin Sister and Young the Giant. Shows are reasonable. The most I have paid for a show was $26 and the least was $5.  You can also just visit without seeing a show. It's so fun to hang out in the lounge to eat and drink. Most of the time, you can still hear the show if you are sitting inside.   *be aware... shows actually start an hour or two after doors open. You may have to wait."}
{"text":"Good stuff here.  Very authentic and a few different items you won't find in mainstream Mexican food. The Poquito bean and cheese burrito is grilled on the outside to finish - delicious."}
{"text":"Went to the Crescent Ballroom last night as I understood they were have a Flamenco troupe...and it was free. Never been there before. Easily found it, parking right around the corner. Funky place with a bar area and small stage/seating area. Through a door is the main showroom, I did not go there. As the 6 pm show time approached the bar filled up to capacity plus. The Flamenco troupe was outstanding, I loved it, every minute of it. Male and female dancer, female singer and male guitarist. Each and every one of them was fantastic. The audience loved them. The bar worked around all the music, serving drinks and food. The staff was friendly and did their jobs very well. Prices for drinks and food was reasonable, given there was no charge the entertainment. But, there was a bucket to pay the performers and I gave them a goodly amount as they deserved it. Seems they are not going to do this every Saturday night....so I guess I know where I will be one many a Saturday night. Flamenco is the most soulful, emotional music in the whole world and having it performed a few feet away from you is truly spectacular."}
{"text":"This is plan b after being turned away at that other place. We were very happy with the outcome. The server was pleasant, but a bit slow (we went into the bar for our drinks. The bartender even got me a bowl of water for my dog. We all liked the food and the el pastor tacos I had were delicious."}
{"text":"Best stage in Phoenix for local and/or small to medium sized acts, period. I went here for the Slackers concert (and the Twotone Lizard Kings who I actually came to see), and was really impressed.  My first impression, I had to say was not really positive. It seemed like a new hipster hangout (which it somewhat is, I suppose), and because of the small lounge in the front with the small lounge stage, I thought that the venue part of things was going to also be much smaller. Well, I was wrong. The venue is huge, the stage is huge, and the sound system is absolutely amazing.  I really like the layout of the venue as well. It's difficult to describe (and it probably varies), but Ill say that a little more than 3/4 of the room and half of the stage is devoted to the 21 and up crowd, while the other half of the stage is general admittance for anyone. They have a wisely located merchandise corner. The bar was very big, but out of the way enough so as not to cause \"traffic\" problems, and placed in such a way that by getting a drink, you will not miss a second of the show. They also serve food here, and the drinks did not seem to be wildly overpriced as they usually are at such venues. Further, there are about 5 rows of bleacher seats in the very back for those that prefer their entertainment sitting down rather than standing up. The divider between the general admittance and the drinkers is a convenient place to rest a drink or an elbow whilst enjoying the show.  Everything about this place is just smart. Im a professional musician, and I will gladly advocate that this place has the best sound system in phoenix. The vibe is just right--fun and electric. The stage is big enough for a band of 10 people.  Im hoping that they will embrace some heavier music in the near future, maybe a couple nights a month or something. I understand the type of crowd they are seeking, but really think they would be missing out on a resource of Arizona that has gone untapped for a long time now.  I will definitely be back. Hopefully, Ill also be there soon to play their stage. If the night I had here was anything to judge by, that gig would be would be one hell of a night."}
{"text":"Terrible service, incompetent Daniel(5'2 220 lbs) aggressive with me after a guest was aggressive with me in line for he bathroom and then his girlfriend decided to attack my friend in the bathroom so they kicked us out which was uncalled for. I know the owners and I will be in contact with them."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the high marks this place receives. It must be for the music venue. The food is bar food and not very good at that. The shrimp quesadilla was overcooked. The guacamole tasted weird. The chips were so thick they were hard to chew. Nothing really good other than the service which was ok."}
{"text":"Great venue.  Food was good and the beer was cheap.  Chicken tinga torta before Sister Sparrow and Anders Osbourne show. Good night for a Monday."}
{"text":"This place is the business--both during the day and at night. Go on your lunch break for some great eats that are quick and don't break the bank (don't forget to order a Mexican coke while your at it). At night, the fun-sized concert venue is always a good time. I dig the Arizona Storytellers Project that comes in occasionally, as well as seeing some up-and-coming artists that my friends drag me to. The crowd is a lot of down-to-earth Phoenix lovers, which is a nice break from the douchey type that inhabit a lot of the valley. (Yes old town, I'm talking smack about your crowd)"}
{"text":"Definitley love this place. Its different but fun and great music. They bring in great musical artist like Iron and Wine, DJ Trasit etc. All different types of people are in here but the majority is hipster...to the max ha! fun place and i would def go again"}
{"text":"Second time at Crescent for a concert, it was equally a mess to get in....so hot and stuffy inside the ballroom. We left early although the sound system is great and the artist we saw was awesome...it was too hot to stay longer."}
{"text":"I can't say I am an expert critic at music venues by any means, but what I can say is that I love a great atmosphere and this place has just that! I went here with my sister for the Blitzen Trapper show last night. I hadn't been before but I had read some good reviews below and this place hit the marks.   The place has an outdoor patio and indoor seating that make for a perfect hangout spot pre-show. They can open up the walls when the weather is nice so everything is so open and airy. I heard the food was decent, but we had dinner elsewhere so I wouldn't really know - except I was tempted at 12:00am after the show to order up one of their churros. The drinks were really good. I had the rest stop which was delicious.   You can hear the music at a nice level from the outside area, but not enough to prevent conversations with friends and fellow drinkers. The venue isn't too huge so you feel like you are experiencing a pretty rockin show with everyone around you. The sound quality to me seemed great minus a few occasions where I thought the ringing of my ears wouldn't stop, but I blame the band Dawes for simply rockin the house down before the main act go on stage.   There is seating in the back and on the sides so you if you don't want to stand don't worry there is plenty of room to sit. There is a bar in the back to order drinks and on the other side the band usually sets up show with their merch. There are also plenty of bathrooms in the back so don't fret if there is a long line at the front where there is only one stall.   Can't wait to go back here again. FYI - if you take the light rail after 11:30pm make sure you are parked at the right spot because they don't run on the full track. We made that mistake and had to cab it the rest of the way while some poor souls had to walk."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is for the venue only, not the food! We came tonight for the Magic Giant Concert & this is my new favorite concert venue. It was intimate, good acoustics, lighting & plenty of space (including bleacher style seating in the back for those that want to sit). Bar had a good variety of beer & mixed drinks"}
{"text":"In town on business & stopped in for dinner and music on a Monday in Feb.  Food was great, establishment had character, waitress was cool, 3 free bands with places to sit or dance.  Highly recommended for a night out."}
{"text":"Best place for an intimate concert and a good beer!  Parking is a little bit tricky you'll have to walk a few minutes for a good spot. Very good bands come to the Crescent like Metronomy, London Grammar or The Bright Light Social Hour.  You won't be disappointed by this venue."}
{"text":"Nice experience here.  Venue was great, food was good (not amazing).  Outside patio is nice.  Service was not the greatest, but I wasn't expecting red carpet treatment since we were just ordering tacos, etc.  I mostly came for the band that was playing that night so all the food related service was just a plus."}
{"text":"Fantastic guacamole! Great choice of music!"}
{"text":"Crescent ballroom is one of the 'cool and hip' places in Phoenix that you can typically depend on to have something going on every night. I've been to one of their concerts, music bingo, and plain old dinner/drinks. I'm not sure how often they have musical bingo, but I would recommend making it to one of those-It was a good time! In the evenings, they use candles for lighting as well as stringed lights. This adds that relaxed ambiance so many people associate the place with.   Now for the not so great... the service is  ALWAYS SO SLOW. I've been there when its busy and when it's pretty sparse and its just always slow. I don't know if this is something that you just have to expect when going to a restaurant that isn't known for good food or service but rather their atmosphere, still it can be frustrating. Maybe its just less forgivable because a couple of the servers don't have the nicest attitudes.   The food is Ok.. Their cheesy bean dip appetizer is pretty spot on.   My first time there I ordered wine and they gave it to me in a clear plastic cup..weird or is that just me?"}
{"text":"Sweet music venue. Plenty of diversity on the shows. Overall the music sounds awesome! It's not to large of a place so no matter were you are at you are getting your moneys worth with sound and stage presence. Also I love the bench seats at the rear!"}
{"text":"More management!!!!!!!!! Horrible service. Crappy DJ. Bathrooms are disgusting!!! Sound quality is poor. Unfriendly. I would give this place a big fat ZERO!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for concerts and I have to say I love it here. Small venue always provides the most intimate shows with a perfect view no matter where you are in the room.  Not to mention their very tasty cocktails  at reasonable prices considering it's a concert venue too. They don't jack the prices and water down the drinks. Love it!"}
{"text":"It's the thing to do 90s theme got to, it is super busy but both drink line and bathroom line quick it's for real. Check it out. You'll like it."}
{"text":"I'm personally burnt out on the whole hipster thing. I guess because it's been a popular trend for a really long time in cities other than Phoenix. I kind of feel like it's almost passé now days.   However, whenever I want to get my hipster fix I come to places like this and listen to 20 something year olds talk about all the cool stuff they like and all the mainstream stuff they think is lame, while dressed exactly like every other hipsterific poser in the place that studies American Apparel billboards. I guess it's better than the 45 year old hipsters of Silverlake, but whatevs.  Anyhow, sure, it's a cool place. It looks cool. The drinks are pretty good too. I had some food here once. It was good, as in it didn't taste frozen or microwaved, but flavor wise it was just ok- nothing epic."}
{"text":"We have seen lots of fun shows here.  The food was over priced in my opinion, but the live music and band atmosphere is Oh So Amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered food about 30 minutes before last call. I wated and waited and not until after the grill and kitchen were cleaned was I informed my order was forgotten. I have always felt relatively put off by Valley Bars atmosphere in general, both from the slightly too loud atmosphere to the often unfriendly crowd that this is just one of several instances where I question why I wouldn't rather spend time at a different establishment. I know they are a cherished part of Phoenix, but sometimes I don't think they deserve the reputation they have."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I frequent downtown. Drinks are reasonably priced and there's typically pretty good music or a band playing. They also host a lot of interesting events which can end up being pretty fun."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Spain, I have to check out flamenco. The traditional Spanish dance is so beautiful and full of spirit, with colorful costumes, energetic music, and emotive singing. While you can catch it weekly at Pepin in Scottsdale, I was really smitten with a recent flamenco performance I saw at Crescent Ballroom, which features free flamenco every Saturday night from 6-8 p.m.  The performances are done by local flamenco dance troupe Flamenco Por La Vida. When I went, there were two ladies and a guy tearing it up on the small stage at Crescent's lounge area, and they alternated dancing while a guitarist strummed. It was captivating and intimate, and about as close as you can get to an authentic Spanish experience. Sip on some of Crescent's sangria, and enjoy!  Also, besides the awesome flamenco -- I'm in love with Crescent's food (the chips and burritos are amazing!), and the sound and atmosphere at the concerts is always high-quality and friendly. It's an all-in-one amazing place!"}
{"text":"What an odd place. Don't know what they're going for but it works. Food and beer excellent. Band was pretty bad but somehow it all comes together.best for a large group. Can't sit at the bar and eat"}
{"text":"I went here once with one of my friends whom loves this place; however, this was not a place for me. The music was very loud in the lounge area and the place was uncomfortably over crowded."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were amazing, reminded me of the ones in Mexico! Only thing that killed this place for me was they forgot the side of rice my girlfriend ordered, and when we finally received it the Mexican rice was undercooked, great in flavor, just super crunchy!"}
{"text":"Not only a great place to see a show, but a well rounded small menu makes this cozy spot a plus. With a Mexican center, their menu has many spicy eats as well as a a good drink list. Pair that with the constant love music and cool vibe to give you a great place to go after a long day at work or a night out."}
{"text":"Such a fun and relaxed place. They have events every night,  bands,  cancers etc. Check out their website,  some of them are free. Great burritos,  really good drinks and staff is friendly. The building used to be a body shop I think,  regardless,  I really like the reuse while conserving the buildings original uniqueness."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Went to 90s hip hop night. Drinks are fairly priced, the employees are nice, and the DJ was good. There is a lot of room on the patio if you don't want to be in the lounge. Would go back!"}
{"text":"what a cool spot! we had tix to see John Spencer Blues Explosion and we arrived early to get a bite to eat.   it wasn't crowded (yet) on a thursday night so we had plenty of outdoor dining. our service was quick and friendly, but......if you have tix to a show, DON'T FORGET!!!!!....there is a 25% off coupon on your ticket! we didn't realize this and thus missed out on a great discount.  the food was latin flair...chips/salsa, street tacos, burritos. all very tasty and moderately priced. their happy hour deals looked great.  the music venue is just off the restaurant. it's a great little space, mostly standing room. if you get there early, you can snag one of the wooden bleacher seats. there is a full bar in the music venue, along with restrooms. the sound quality was pretty good i thought, but since it's a small area, i highly recommend earplugs (i'm over 40 and that tip was for all the youngsters out there)."}
{"text":"I came here for March Fourth Marching Band. The boyfriend gave it 3.5 but any place that serves hard cider is a winner. The venue has good music and nice bleachers (although it is hard to see if you are on the first two levels). Lively crowd on a Friday, serves food, two bathroom options, and indoor/outdoor bar/eats outside the venue. Hipster vibe."}
{"text":"This is a great venue to see live music, in a semi-intimate setting and a good design.  They pull in many acts that are perfect to see in this size venue."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place for the past few years now and enjoy the nice setting and really good food! The entertainment is great and the atmosphere is very inviting. The level of performers and talent they showcase is very good!! However, the ONLY reason I give this place 3 out of 5 stars is because of the few sour staffers that give the rest of the great employees a bad name. Some waitstaff are pretensions and condescending and the doormen can be jerks!"}
{"text":"This place is like a fine wine, gets better with age. Best venue in AZ! Great music all the time and the food is not your typical bar menu either. That's how you do it!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize Crescent was open for lunch until recently and remembered really liking my burrito when I had gone for a show several years ago. Decided to stop in on my way to a meeting downtown recently and the burrito was as good as I remembered and definitely filling! Both the red and green salsas are delicious -- the green more tangy and the red offering a little more heat.  The service was friendly but I was a little disappointed to get a flat soda replaced with another flat soda with no one sticking around to see if it was any better (which it wasn't, obviously). When my food arrived, I let them know there was no improvement and requested water instead and I wasn't charged for the soft drink. Good communication, but I really could've used that caffeine boost to survive my meeting.   Metered parking so come prepared!"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for trivia night which also happened to coincide with a concert so it was packed. But thankfully it wasn't an issue getting seating. After the sun dropped the patio was dark. Not like, romantic, but dark. I had trouble seeing my food.   I ordered the salad and added on barbacoa and grilled veggies. It was an interesting assortment of flavors that I very much enjoyed. It was hard grabbing our waiter most of the night, but like I said, busy. And while I understand that it is a music venue I wish that the food and smoking areas were separated. Nothing like trying to chow down and get a nice whiff of smoke."}
{"text":"Finally! Phoenix has a venue to attract indie bands that I want to see without the gritty, dirty feeling you get at the Marquee Theater.  I was there opening night and two more times within the short period of time it has been open.  Great little patio/bar in the front with an intimate music venue in the back.   I was pumped that Chris Bianco was part of the menu, but honestly can't say it's anything special....so go for music but go somewhere else to eat"}
{"text":"Love this place on Friday nights! The 2000s night is my favorite! Along with their throwback nights of Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys! This is the spot if I'm looking to dance!"}
{"text":"I really really love this place but lately the service is just non existent. It takes way too long for servers to notice you, actually get to you and bring anything out let alone get the bill (this is if a server actually does notice you btw). Better off ordering at the bar. Kinda done eating here but will always be in for shows."}
{"text":"Been here only a few times and it's everything I love about PHX.  One night it's 90's club night, next it's live flamenco dancing, next it's alternative music concert.     Foods pretty good too, simple Mexican fare, burritos, tacos, chips and salsa etc.  Service has always been friendly.  Really no complaints here, if you're looking for some music and drinks look this place up to see what's scheduled.     It's a little on the outskirts of central downtown which is what I think keeps this venue intimate yet fun.  Next time copper blues and valley bar are nuts (other downtown faves of mine) I'll definitely head this way."}
{"text":"I just have nothing bad to say about this place.  Combines the best of all possible worlds and hosts a number of super cool local artists.  Did not get any of their food but I've heard it's great - the service was spot on the entire night and I look forward to returning for a number of future shows!"}
{"text":"Went for Mj vs. Prince event 1/4. I had high hopes for this and I was really let down. The event did not even start til after 11pm on a Friday night (hello most peeps have worked all day.) The pre-dj was better than the mj vs. Prince dj only thing is that he wasn't allowed to play any of music we paid to hear. Sad part is that many people left after waiting so long because they were tired of waiting. This event had a ton of patrons and could been a blast. Instead I was walking out by midnight. Hopefully another establishment will take on this genre and revamp the idea!"}
{"text":"Totally sick place- good food, cheap drinks, interesting beers on tap and friendly staff.  Came here before a show, drank and had a good time hanging out in a chill place, came back after the show for an after party. It was rammed with tons of people dancing to a DJ- no one was pushy or rude...pretty cool crowd. The drinks were being poured spicy. Like super spicy. Just how I like it. I'm pretty sure someone poured me straight rum. Thanks! (next day...not so much)...."}
{"text":"I've been to the Crescent twice now and both visits were \"rad\". Like that? It's hipster lingo. If you don't like it, this may not be your scene.  I'm kidding.  I think it'd take a very particular type of person not to like this place. I mean, the food is excellent (I had the mouth-watering Lalo burger, with sautéed green peppers and melted cheddar cheese) and the look of the place is neat; I'm guessing it was an old mechanic shop long ago. Last but not least, this place gets some of the best musicians I know of to play here, and they're kind enough to stream the music live from the show inside to those outside (who may have not bought their tickets before the show was completely soldout - heh).  From 90's acts with cult followings such as the Dandy Warhols and Eels to up-and-coming indie stars like Phantogram and Allah-Las, this place gets the shows I want to see.  I'll be returning many more times."}
{"text":"I went to a seminar here and as that didn't thrill me so much I made a move to the bar area to see what that was about.   Crafty drinks, nice conversational atmosphere, and the food was killer.  Highly recommend the guac! Nice and chunky so you could see it was just made in house.  I couldn't make my mind up on what burrito so I went with the tacos.  The plate comes with 3 so I went with the barbacoa and al pastor.. They load each one up with meat and the toppings are prime.  Ill definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star due to the fact that the customer experience is far from adequate. I come here on a regular for events and just everyday lunch/dinner service. Events are amazing and alway have a fun atmosphere but I've recently noticed that the day staff (servers/bartenders) aren't welcoming. This isn't just a one time occasion, it's been a handful and multiple different employees. It usually takes the server some time to greet my party and lately there hasn't been any welcoming vibes from the servers. I've waited countless amount of times for a sever to even come back and check on their table. I manage in the food service industry and knowing that the FOH staff aren't welcoming isn't helping the company, I'm aware that it's a \"bar\" and I'm not expecting 5 star services but I ask for the day FOH crew to smile and make me want to come back for food."}
{"text":"Hard for me to judge this nice place given I don't do concerts or booze, so I will have to judge the food only. My buddy and I stopped by for lunch and I knocked out three tacos (barbacoa, pulled pork, and fish). They were all good but the fish was the real winner. It was very tasty and I would order it again. The meal did come with a couple of chips and by a couple, I mean a couple. Menu seemed focused on Mexican cuisine and with that, I would assume you would get chips before the meal. Not the case. They did have specials for food and drink which is nice, just didn't apply to my meal today. Given that, the price of my meal did seem a bit high for lunch. If you can set your meal to fall on the day of one of their specials, the price point would be more favorable. Our server was very fast and friendly but the place seemed short staffed to handle a busy lunch crowd. Overall, the place again appears great for music and drinks, but I was there for just the food and it was average given the price and quality."}
{"text":"I went to the Crescent Ballroom for the Banks & Steelz concert and thought the venue was very scenic and was a cool place to go for a show. My issues with the place is how confused I was when dealing with the employees. The ticket counter was in the front of the building but the employees seemed to be out of it. Not reading my ID correctly and not telling us where to go. They then told us to go behind the building to get to the correct area. Most of the employees were nice but some just were very rude about little things and treated me like a child. I will attend shows here again I just wished they were nicer to their guest."}
{"text":"I love that this venue is right downtown just two blocks from where I work. They've had some great live music in the short time that they've been open. Even if you don't want to pay the cover to see the show you can still hear the tunes while sitting at the bar having a beer or righteous cocktail or two.  I like the atmosphere of the place but was a little disappointed that the cocktail I paid for was at first delayed and finally not available after about ten minutes of waiting (due to lack of ingredients). I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that they are still getting up and running but that was still a bit of a shocker.  Haven't tried the food here yet but I'm eager to come back and take in some more live tunes and have a few cocktails."}
{"text":"I love the Crescent Ballroom for many reasons. First off I credit them for bringing more shows to the valley. Whoever books for them does a great job, and I feel they can be credited for stimulating the shows that come here. Before five years ago, I would have to travel out of town or state to see a decent gig, things have all changed and I truly feel the CB had a lot to do with that and with inspiring other venues like Valley Bar, to follow suit (may be the same owner too, idk). Secondly, I love that their audio engineers are varied and experienced and many of which get hired from local Audio Engineering school CRAS, the best  school for AE and live sound. Thirdly, their food, everything about their food is amazing."}
{"text":"Had a really good time at this place! I went there on Saturday night with a friend of mine and the atmosphere was pretty awesome. We were able to comfortably get a table outside, and to my surprise they served food pretty late. We had Moscow mules, and they were delicious. Everyone that worked there was very nice. We will definitely be going to this place again."}
{"text":"13 of us ate outside and had a wide variety of food. Everyone thought their food was very good. A few local people had never heard of the place and will be back. The rest of us were from out if town and when we come back we will eat here again.  Can't really comment on the bands as we sat at the end of the gated area outside."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is an iconic establishment in downtown Phoenix!  I have been visiting Crescent for over 1 1/2 years and I have had only great experiences.  It is one of the more authentic, laid back venues in the area and it's a great addition to the downtown scene.  I only go to Crescent for a specific concert or show.  I have never gone \"just to hang out\" but I know it would be a great spot for that as well.  I love a good concert, especially new independent music.  Crescent brings some wonderful bands to Phoenix who you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.  There are so many bands that are uber successful now but I first got to see them at a small, intimate concert at Crescent.    The food and bar are above average for a concert venue.  The food is somewhat mexican themed with some salads and breakfast sandwiches mixed in.  It's inexpensive and good quality.  I recommend the bean dip and tacos.  Always a good choice!   The drink selection is good if you're into beer and hipster cocktails.  My only complaint is that they only have 4 beers on draft and I love draft beer.  But they have a large selection of cans.  The mixed drinks are interesting - especially the Honey Badger which is a bourbon version of a moscow mule.    I think Crescent does a great job of cultivating a friendly, artistic scene in Phoenix and I am looking forward to many more visits in the future!"}
{"text":"Crescent is one of my favorite places to drop into for all kinds of reasons.... particularly Saturday night dance parties.   Sure it may be a little hip, but to be honest, I think this is exactly the type of thing downtown Phoenix needs more of. It's a great place to grab a drink, catch a show, dance your pants off, meet new people, and generally have a great time without the bougie atmosphere other areas of the valley may offer.  By all means, if you like whiskey and ginger beer - get yourself a HONEY BADGER. They're on happy hour and are generally delicious.  MAJOR PROPS to the CB for expanding their patio areas as well. Most businesses aren't as proactive with stuff like that and would rather just keep a line waiting outside. Last time I was there, the added space was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. I will say that the DJ on the Friday I was there rocked it out with all the latest and greatest Motown hits. The burrito I had (because I was starving) was pretty good and my malibu and pineapple was a-ok. I will have to try out the live music one of these days, but for now, you get a decent four star rating in my book!"}
{"text":"Seen several shows here, awesome venue, great shows. The food is alright and the drink list leaves a lot to be desired (as a beer drinker).  My only real beef with this place is every one working there thinks they are God's gift to the service industry. They are a venue that damn near refuses to sell tickets to their own shows, if you go in to avoid the $12 online  \"convenience fees\" and ask to buy tickets the bartenders will literally just walk away and tell the other bartenders not to bother with you until some unwitting server happens by because that is apparently their responsibility and it is clearly beneath the bar staff. Happens every time. The servers have no clue how to actually sell tickets and when they finally figure it out there are still processing fees because they are acquiring them 3rd party. It will take you no less than 20 min, 15 of which is just standing awkwardly at the bar waiting for the poor server that ask you if you've been helped, to buy tickets to a show. Half way through trying to sell you tickets she will walk off to tend her tables without a word to you and, if you are lucky, hand you off to another server that walked up to tell her she's got a table. Every. Single. Time. I've never in my life seen a venue that can't, physically can't sell tickets to their own shows. And if you ask why you are paying an additional $5 for $20 tickets AT THE VENUE there's a guy server who clearly thinks he's still a bouncer at whatever the last shit hole he worked at is, who is more than happy to get in your face SUPER aggressively about it and tell you you can fuck off and try to buy your tickets elsewhere if you don't like it. Not even sure where that guy came from or why he was eavesdropping and interrupting but you'll know hes there for sure.  The venue it's self is awesome and the shows are legit, food is pretty good but not impressive and drinks are small venue drinks, but the entire staff needs a refresher course in customer service and you should be fully prepared to pay about 25-50% more than the falsely advertised ticket prices (depending on how many you buy) because they don't even handle their own tickets IF you have the patience to repeatedly flag down staff members until you get one that will actually do there job. Pretty much has been the same experience just eating dinner there when I did eat the fees and buy tickets online. The wait staff is very much the \"fly by\" type who doesn't have time for you, doesn't care to answer any questions about the menus, don't know the beer lists and has no problem making it clear they have other shit to do than deal with you.  You want to pay hiked, falsely advertised prices for a show and not deal with the staff, this is the place for you. You want to buy your tix at the box office to get (close to) the advertised price and grab a bite and a drink before the show I'd not get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Great sound. Great location. Great bands. GREAT eye candy. Can't speak for the beer or the food, but if it's as good as the rest of the place, I surely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really intimate venue!   I was pleasantly surprised seeing Skylar Grey there last night after reading the lousy few reviews it got.    I had a great experience!   Tacos were great before hand!"}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom has never disappointed! This place is a venue, but I've never actually come here for the music. They have a great menu and happy hour, so I've just come for that! There is plenty of outdoor seating, both upstairs on a balcony, and downstairs on a patio surrounded by misters! If it's too hot, inside is cute as well. The tacos are where it's at! The tortillas are soooo greasy and authentic... my favorite is the pastor. There are little chunks if pineapple inside, yum! During happy hour they are a great deal. The micheladas are great also. The waiters/waitresses have always been so friendly. There are nights with free music, so keep an eye on their schedule. I definitely recommend Crescent Ballroom if you are looking for a Taco Tuesday happy hour!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised- GREAT food, good drinks and wonderful service. Place is a a lot smaller that I thought, but it has great ambiance and is very intimate. Bar is good and they have outdoor seating. Just a nice place to hang!"}
{"text":"On a bar hop adventure a few hours before heading to the Van Buren to watch a concert.  Me and my buddy must have hit 3 bars before being told about this place.  We enjoy trying new places and were told this spot is where the \"locals\" go after work.  We walked-up and the place wasn't too busy. It was 530 pm on a Tuesday. (Yesterday) we found 2 seats at the bar and greeted the bartender. The guy was mid 20's, sandy brown hair, thin, facial hair. He asked what we wanted and we asked if there were any specials. This clown actually took a drink menu and tossed it at us and said, \"Here, you can read.\" Wow, really? I chuckled because where I am thinking, \"Forget this guy,\" my buddy is still being friendly. He asks for what kind of whiskey is used in the Old Fashion and again the guy points at the menu and says, \"It says right here.\" pointing.  My buddy ordered the Old Fashion and I asked what IPA's on tap he had. He pointed behind him and said, \"They're right there.\"   LOL, OK... so customer service isn't your strong point. Neither is being friendly. I ordered an IPA and asked if we wanted to open a tab. I gave him my credit card and told him to open the tab. He went to the register, rang the bill up then closed us out. Handing my the receipt and asking for me to sign. He also asked, \"What bar you going to next\" with an obvious insinuation he didn't want us there. I guess we were going to be one and done with this bozo. We didn't even finish our drinks. We left not wanting to be around this guy. Not the kind of guy I would waste on by being around his negative vibe. I wrote zero tip on the line, but my buddy being in customer service left a $3 tip and said maybe it would help the guy buy a better personality.  We left and headed to the Valley bar.  Was told by the bartender at the Valley Bar that the owner owns both places, it's just that the Crescent was opened years before the Valley. He constantly apologized for the rude service we got at Crescent."}
{"text":"This music venue is set up perfectly! They are efficient and the staff was awesome!  The separation of the dining and actually music ballroom was a nice change, it was good for us because we were able to eat and drink at the same venue.  The ballroom had bleacher style seats in the back and had the middle pit area for those who wanted to stand and watch the band.  AND LASTLY, THE A/C was blasting, kept us comfortable all night and we enjoyed it very much!!! The food, service, venue, doesn't get any better! This was our first time here, and I hope to see more shows at the Crescent Ballroom!"}
{"text":"Took a gamble coming here for the 2015 New Year's Eve block party this past year, but I am glad my group did this place. Albeit crowded, it was a big enough venue to actually move around, hear yourself within a conversation you're having with others, and listen to great jazz music. Nice staff and clean restrooms as well!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been 5 or 6 times and have brought fairly large parties with me every time. The music is good, the atmosphere is good, burritos are good, the chips are less than medium, the drinks and churros are really awesome, but I just keep getting served by the meanest waitress in the industry.  I politely told her that she charged us twice for a single PBR. She hates to hear this. She ripped the bills out of our hands, threw them down on the table next to us and yelled at us (there was a clear and definite raising of the voice) that she slipped the whole bill in with one person's individual bill as well. This lady really needs to lose the 'tude.   But the joke's on me, because I'll be back. I guess I don't care if you yell at me, just as long as you keep feeding me churros and whiskey drinks."}
{"text":"This place is sadly very understaffed. I understand there is an event on a daily basis where the main venue is but for those of us visiting for the first time and sitting in the dining area, we are being walked by like we dont exist. There is no excise for that. Probably an awesome place, but I likely wont come back. Customer service is important especially for someone who was in the business for many years."}
{"text":"Not a single complaint about this place!   We decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:  ~friendly staff ~nice outdoor patio ~reasonably priced drinks ~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom. ~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show ~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).  We didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, I was just there to see Creed Bratton. I was pleasantly surprised by the drink/food menu and the kind and prompt greeting from the female bartender. The food was good and they have One of my favorite vodkas that Nobody else has in Arizona. The male bartender last night was a total tool and a complete ahole... I showed up at 6 and the show didn't start until 8 so I was there early because it was on my way home from work and decided to avoid traffic. I was eating and drinking and I around 7/7:30 people started to cash out at the bar and get up and leave they started to take the stools, but nobody asked me to move... When more people started coming up to the bar to order drinks I still just sat in my seat enjoying my beverage and even got another one. I was sitting at the end of the bar closer to the patio. Shortly after I heard the mail bartender say \"I can't believe we have a line because of one f*cking seat.\" I wasn't so much surprised to hear him cursing because he dropped the F bomb and curse-words behind the bar more that he spoke regular words but I just assumed that's the type of establishment that is except none of the other employees did. I've run a bar before and I've been a bartender and if they didn't want people sitting at the bar after a certain time so that they could serve the numerous amounts of people walking up to get drinks they could have just asked and I gladly would have moved outside which I did after the bartender decided to be a complete and total asshole. I still left a 20% tip I'm not going to threaten that I'm not coming back or I'm gonna tell my friends to not go there because anybody in the industry knows that's just a dumb thing to say and the other staff members were just great and it's a really cool establishment and I'm glad I got to experience it but that mail bartender the one who's getting ready to leave for Denver apparently is a piece of sh*t.    And I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes as I'm using speak to text."}
{"text":"I have been here many times to drink but never to see a show. Michelle Branch was awesome the Preshow was fabulous a bit difficult to navigate. All in all $5 Sangria can't do no wrong! This was a great place and show to celebrate my moms 60th thanks Crescent and Michelle"}
{"text":"Impressive! I like the seating in the back, the bar and bartenders are great, menu looked great, can't wait to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"Still in love with Crescent Ballroom. In fact, even more so!   Great service.  Good prices. Awesome music. Great vibe. Good times!  This is the perfect place for music lovers. Look for me...I plan to be a regular for some time to come."}
{"text":"This is a food and customer service review.   The food is good but the customer service is whack, probably one of the worst especially when busy. A colleague recommended the place for lunch, so we called in for a to-go order and went to pick up the food (11am-12pm). Service was non-existent, seriously. Have you ever walked into a place confused where to go and eventually ask around for help? Yeah, this is one of those places.  Same thing happens if you eat-in, it's really unorganized. I had 3 separate people ask me, \"Hey, are you also waiting to be seated?\" or \"Do you know how we can order food?\". The last person who asked me got so tired of waiting for someone to help them, they eventually left.  Hire one lady to stay up front, seat people and take care of people with to go orders. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"There's only a handful of legit places in the state that serves a proper bean burrito. You dam well know that Crescent nail that damn thing down!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to hipster environment mixed with great service and great tunes."}
{"text":"I've visited Crescent Ballroom for 3 concerts this year. Cold War Kids (twice!) and Blackalicious. All shows were great! The first CWK show was actually the carnivale electric event in the spring. Although it was outdoors and POURING rain the entire time, it was a great set up and a lot of fun was had.   The other 2 shows indoors were awesome, as well. Great sized, intimate venue that brings to town some great, indie acts. The crowd has always been great and I love that they have the bar area near the stage and the under age area up front for all ages shows. I took my daughter to see CWK the 2nd time and we got to be right up front without showing up 2 hours early!! :) She loved it, as did I...mainly because I wasn't watching in the rain this time around.   I will continue to check their schedule and hope to make one of their trivia nights or even just pop in for an impromptu concert some time. Who knows, I might find a great new act to follow!"}
{"text":"The chicken burrito is an absolute must. I hear the burgers are amazing.. its hard to change it past the burrito tho, so maybe I will explore some time! The ambience is awesome. The venue is good ( Ive only attended one show and it was outside). The drinks are pretty amazing- they are strong! Selection on tap could be better, but they make up for it in other canned beers and liquors. If you're trying to have a relaxing beverage after work, make sure you leave before the crowd because it will get packed and LOUD. The bartenders are pretty cool, I have to say that the majority of the women bartenders are somewhat snobby... but they probably deal with a lot of BS from guys hitting on them. But this bar has become my cheers bar! They also give away tix on Thurs (used to be Tues) during lunch. But get there early and ASK- don't assume they will offer them to you (learned this the hard way after loosing the opportunity for some prime tickets I specifically went for and they were gone)."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent room for a mid-sized club acts.  My new favorite venue.  Sound is terrific, and there's a section for under-21's if I want to take my daughter.  Nice variety of craft beers on tap or bottled.  Bleachers (hmm, interesting...) or tables if you want to sit, plenty of room in front of the stage if you want to stand. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"Been here more and more in the past few months. I have yet to see a show here, but I have enjoyed a few adult beverages and some food here. Drinks are cheap and they are made swiftly. I believe I had the veggie burrito, which did not come out as swiftly, but was damn tasty. The salsas they have for the table are quite amazing. So amazing, that I may or may not know someone who decided to \"borrow\" them for future use.   Hipster central, so just be prepared for a lot of flannel, beanies, and skinny jeans. Lines for the bathrooms are a staple.  I would like to catch a show here in the very near future, but they do have some fairly decent DJs on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"They must have recently hired a new crew. Last two times I've been there, there's one girl in particular who is insufferably rude.   PRO TIP: bring cash for the bars. Every time I go there, my card either gets charged twice or I get overcharged."}
{"text":"The Tacos de Barbacoa were good! The crowd is young, the live DJ was on point. Atmosphere is Hipster-ish but any one can fun here.  Would have gotten a 5 if not for the \"I could care less\" demeanor of one of the girls behind the bar.  Get the Tacos and Enjoy the Music!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food, music and specialty drinks here.  The only thing that could possibly influence me to take away a star from my review is the fact that the service we have received every time we've eaten here has been terrible.  We had the same server each time.  She told us the wrong drink specials for the day the first time.  The second time she had no idea that half the beers they have were out of stock because they had a busy weekend and hadn't gotten another shipment in.  She acts like she doesn't care about her job or the customers and she disappears frequently for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Maybe if we got another server I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"We randomly went here looking for a place to get a beer while we were staying downtown. Didn't know what to expect.  They had a decent selection of craft beers and cocktails.  We had a couple of appetizers, and the food was great.  Hot sauces were on point.  I'd go back for sure, no bands were playing when we were there, but that'd be cool."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but the concert venue is as good as it gets! Phoenix is blessed with so many stages for local, national, and international bands, and this is definitely at the top of the list. There's food and booze, and a great atmosphere. Room to sit or stand, whatever your music listening choice may be."}
{"text":"We received above average service so I can't speak negatively on that.  Our drinks were good etc. etc.  I am leaving the negative review because while sitting on the patio for the hour or so I was there, an African American bouncer absolutely lost his shi* not once, not twice but on 3 separate occasions.  Screaming like a lunatic at a pair of 5' blonds, screaming in the face of another person in line, screaming at someone walking away for god knows what.  I mean screaming / yelling at the top of his lungs.  This guy is a complete basket case.  You should fire this man immediately.  The point of security is to deescalate situations...not crate them.  This guy has no business working in this type of industry.  I have family and friends that frequent this place;  that's no longer allowed.  This guy is an abusive pric*.  Get rid of him.  You are creating a hostile environment for your guests.  I pay for atmosphere...why would I want to be subjected to having to hear this guy?  I'm sure he was much more humble unemployed and homeless...you don't give crazy people authority."}
{"text":"The crescent ballroom is awesome. I went once with my husband to a hip hop show, and I loved the way it was set up. We hung out outside for a while, loved seeing everyone who walked up right in front. The restaurant section is cool, we want to go some time during the day. The drinks were really reasonable and the bartender was great. The venue is a good size, and everything was set up really well.  I went one other time for a private event, which I did not know about previously. They had the restaurant and venue part shut off from each other and the guest's at the event didn't even realize there was another side.  I would definitely book this place up if I needed an awesome location and wanted to hire a live band to play. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Went to crescent ballroom a few months ago and haven't been back. Here's why:  My boyfriend and I are both East Coast transplants. We had been to old town and were in search of a spot a little less...plastic?   We found that at Crescent Ballroom. We liked that it was laid-back, has live music and cold beer.   We posted up at a table and asked for a server. The kind lady said that we would have to get our drinks from the bar. So we started a tab and had a couple beers while watching Dylan Pratt. He was really fantastic and I would love to see him again. We ordered some nachos and continued to watch the show. Nachos never showed so we assumed she forgot to order them for us. No biggy. We were ready to leave and asked for the tab.   Upon seeing the nachos still listed on the bill, I reminded her that we never actually had them. It's 3 or 4 bucks so whatever, right? But I don't make it a habit of paying for something I ordered but never received. The server/bartender/non-food deliverer says,\"I told you that you would have to come to the bar for your drinks and food.\"  Me-\"I understand. But couldn't you have tapped on my shoulder to say that the food was up?\"   She refused to take the nachos of the bill. Girlfriend wants to play hardball. That's cool too. I asked to speak the manager. The manager says, \"Didn't you understand that you would have to get your food from the bar?\" And...then...I lost it.   Me-\"Are you kidding? Yes, but I find it a little ridiculous that our food sat up on the bar while we were watching the show and no one could let us know it was ready? Or just drop it off to us. Aren't you the manager? Isn't it your job to make sure things like that don't happen?\"  Manager-\"Let's step outside and talk about this. You are disturbing the other customers.\"  So funny. Haha, I felt literally felt like Ben Stiller in the \"bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!\" scene of Meet the Parents. Only I wasn't dealing with a chirpy flight attendant. It was worse...I was dealing with a hipster. I get it. You are cooler than me in many ways. You're not wearing a bra and you read more books and watch more indie movies than I do. But I'm your customer, a first time customer who decided to spend my hard earned money and my valued personal time at your establishment. Have some respect for that. Take the $3 hit and let me leave your restaurant wanting to return.   After spending 9 years in the restaurant industry, I know when to tell a customer \"Sorry for the inconvenience, let me take it off your tab.\"  I tip 20% or more on good service. Even if my food sucks. I don't tip 20% on lazy or pretentious service."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom is probably my absolute favorite place to see a show! It's very spacious, yet intimate. The sound system and acoustics *R*O*C*K*!!!!! The staff has always been really friendly and deliver the utmost in professional service. The layout includes all that you could want in the way of two bars, ballroom, restaurant, indoor/outdoor seating and the place has never given me so much as one reason to complain. Even the bathrooms are always in tip-top. What's more is that the place, as well as the performances booked there, attract a very interesting, eclectic and amiable group of people and I've met someone new and cool everytime I've been there. In short: *L*O*V*E* it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this venue - has lots of character and once I walked in - it smelled good and sweet (not grudgy and dirty like a men's locker room). We had a seat in the back and just hung out waiting for the entertainment to start.  The only issue I had was that the show was supposed to start at 8pm - it didn't. It started more like quarter til 9pm and there were two intermissions that lasted more than thirty minutes until the headliner came on. It's probably not the vendor's fault, more the lack of preparation from the bands.   Anyway, I had a great time - it did start getting really loud though - to the point that my eardrums seemed like they were about to burst! At that point, me and my date proceeded to leave. I don't think that it's because I'm getting old though. I think it's because I'd rather NOT be deaf when I do get old."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! I went there to try to have dinner and watch live flamenco for my birthday last night. I was my first time there and I was really excited because I read all of the amazing reviews this place has. I stepped in and the place was full which was understandable but my friend and I where literately standing for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. Several servers walked by, stared at us and never once approached us to ask if we needed anything or perhaps to tell us that the place was closing soon because they did have a sold out event right after flamenco which I was aware of before going in. Needless to say that my friend and I where confused, felt awkward, and left very disappointed in the place and we did not even get to try their food!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this venue to check out bands. I haven't had a chance to try the food yet."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore crescent.  Countless times I have been here to see shows and just be with friends. I've seen acts varying from huge national acts all the way to local bands and then all the way to 90's hip hop DJs like the other night.  The bartenders are cool and will make pretty much any drink they have the stuff for. The atmosphere is fun and always energetic. I've never had a bad night at Crescent. I love that the building fits in so well with the surrounding area.   One thing I really do want to try, though, is their food. Unfortunately by the time my friends are ready to go out, food is no longer being served. I guess beauty is sacrifice. Ha.  On the real, though, I am continuously coming back to crescent and it will always be one of my stops when I am bar hopping downtown."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks and a bite to eat. I love the location and I love the ambiance of the place, it's really great vibes. As far as the food goes though, it's just ok. The bar is amazing and they have an amazing selection of craft beer which I love. Our server was so laidback and super cool, he made the experience memorable.   I'd definitely come back for evening events and cocktails but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Crescent Ballroom is one of the best places to see a small concert in Phx. The venue was designed with the concert goer in mind. Every spot has an excellent view of the stage, multiple bars which kills long waits for drinks...really great all around. The reason I can only give them 3 stars though is because their outside/parking lot shows. These shows feel like a money grab. Pack as many people as you can into a hot, empty parking lot and enjoy! Really crappy experience. I'll never go to another show they have outside again. I recommend seeing a show here if it's inside...but if it's outside....my advice, take a pass."}
{"text":"Going on a Friday night the concert was sold out, and the main food area was packed. The age group was about 18-25, and reading the other review about being hipster central is no lie. There were no tables to lounge around and enjoy the scene. I will have to go see an actual concert here though. The place looks really upscale and clean. Great atmosphere. Just a little cramped space though."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Popped in from out of town. Margaritas were flavorful. Had the nachos and a few tacos and everything was tasty. Service was great and friendly. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"As far as venues go this is the place to catch a show!!!! Great space makes for awesome interaction with the groups! They bring in some lesser known amazing indie artists! The selection of beer is descent for a show venue.    The front bar seems like a really cool place but I rarely stay with all the other cool places downtown.  The DJ sound setup seems to need some work.  The music was pretty distorted."}
{"text":"Bottom line - Best place to see live music in the Valley.  Why?  Excellent booking of both old and new artists.  Places to sit and stand. Food and drinks are great.  Prices are reasonable. Sound is excellent.   As a former New Yorker who used to traverse the rock clubs of NYC on a weekly basis for many years, this is the only club in the Valley that comes close to anything like a real big city music venue. Obviously many others feel the same way."}
{"text":"This is a cool place for concerts and drinks. I did have food there once and that was awesome too. Parking is pretty convenient  and I felt safe going there for a show by myself too. Check it out"}
{"text":"Fun venue, saw phantogram here and really enjoyed it, spacious and sound proof, great new spot."}
{"text":"Crescent ballroom has the #1 tacos in all of Arizona. They are gourmet tacos with authenticity and tins of great flavor. I can't even write anymore about how tasty their tacos are. This is a must try no questions even asked. Go try their tacos. They also have great burritos and salads!"}
{"text":"The bathrooms are really boring.   That's literally the only less-than-fantastic thing I could come up with. Everything else is spot on: Medium-sized space that feels intimate but not cramped; great sound equipment; stage is the perfect height; bleachers in the back of the room; 2 bars run by friendly people & phenomenal food.  If you haven't been: check out their calendar and try to make it in soon. Or if you'd rather just grab a bite and skip the show, you can go into the front section (\"The Lounge\") and just eat and have a drink without buying a ticket. I recommend the nachos."}
{"text":"My friends and I ended up here on Monday with two friends after we found Fuego Bistro at CityScape closed for the night.    I had never eaten here before so I was excited for the opportunity to try their menu.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  The blackened seasoning was to my liking - just black enough but not burn my mouth spicy.  My friend J ordered a blackened fish taco and a veggie taco.  She raved about the veggie taco so much I got order envy so I'm going to make sure I order them next time.  S had a bean and cheese burrito and after saying how good it was she offered us each a taste.  It was a very good burrito.  I usually find the tortilla overpowers the filling but this tortilla was strong enough to do its job but thin enough to get out of the way.    Our waiter asked if we wanted salsa and brought us both red and salsa verde.  The red salsa is not to be trifled with - it is SPICY!    Sorry Fuego, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I love bean burrito's.  LOVE them!  And I like the Mr. Bean burrito here.  So every once in awhile I'll come here, and mow down on one doused in red and green hot sauce.  Which are both really good.  Like empty half a bottle of hot sauce good.   Maybe why the bottles are now half the size they used to be.  Lol.   Service is hit or miss.  More miss than anything in the years i've been coming here.  However this is a great venue for shows."}
{"text":"Always a good place for a drink or a show. Their tacos are really good, and their mixed drinks are excellent. Highly recommend. Yay."}
{"text":"Their tacos are fantastic! Plenty of choices to pick from. And who can beat a $2.00 taco Wednesday night? I had the barbacoa and carne asada, both fresh ingredients and great flavors bursting in my mouth with each bite.  The only thing that could make this place better is $2.00 PBR on tap. But I suppose a $5 Four Peaks Sunbrew in a can is tasty too.  Great intimate concert hall with very talented musicians, only downfall is the really drunk people spilling drinks on you. If you don't mind the occasional alcohol showers, you will no doubt have a good time."}
{"text":"I love everything about Crescent except for the shorter door man with a really bad attitude. In fact, this would be 5 stars if not for him. He had the nerve to tell my friend and I that we should really find another place to go on Friday night because we're there almost every weekend. If I were the manager or owner, I would love patrons like me who come and spend my hard earned money every week at your establishment. Besides him, everyone else is fantastic. I love the bean and cheese!"}
{"text":"Crescent ballroom is the best! They have great food and drinks, and events and acts are always exciting. Pro tip: there are two sets of bathrooms here!"}
{"text":"What a great venue!  I had never been there before until last night. I went to see Jarabe de Palo play and I was so impressed.  They have an outside seating area but the inside's also very cozy and welcoming. Our server was very attentive and very nice. Also very professional.   The food they serve's AMAZING! I got a couple of tacos and they were to die for! I  was pleasantly suprised by how delicious the tacos were! They have a good selection of food and drinks during happy hour and that salsa verde they serve with their chips ($1 during HH, unbeatable! Tons of chips, too!) is so, so, so good!!  Parking is the only issue I have with this place. I'm not sure they do own a lot but you can park on 3rd Ave and Van Buren as there's a big lot there. Just make sure you have cash, $4 to be exact, because it's one of those parking lots with numbered lots where you deposit money on slots.  All in all, it's a very cool place! I really enjoyed the concert and the venue's just great for a concert like that. Location's great as it is Downtown Phoenix and they have a nice Happy Hour. I understand now why this is such a popular place."}
{"text":"I like the venue...especially the bleachers at the back for the old people who don't want to crowd toward the stage. But ayiyi the drinks are so bad...ordered a long island ice tea. Just don't.... It was too sweet, too sour...and just \"off\". I asked another bartender to make one for me and it wasn't good either. Maybe they just don't have good ingredients...I'm getting picky in my old age. I want my drinks to have the good stuff in them!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the staff is friendly! I'd recommend coming here for lunch because they have great lunch specials and the atmosphere is always relaxed."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite venue.They have wonderful food and outdoor seating. The shows have an intimate feel and everyone that works there is helpful. I love seeing shows at Crescent."}
{"text":"Stopped by their patio for a City employee retirement party and was impressed with the attention the servers as well as the house management gave us.  Drinks were fair and appetizers (especially the guacamole - has mandarin oranges in it) tasty.  Someone in our party who had been there before commented that all the food is great, explaining that the chef from Bianco is the one who works here.  Happy hour has great prices.  Will probably come back whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  A solid place to get a burrito, I suppose, if you're downtown and looking for somewhere to get a burrito besides Taco Bell.  I chose the barbacoa burrito. While the beef was good, it was nothing to write home about. I'll go ahead and say it wasn't seasoned enough. Their chips are fresh and the salsa is delicious.  Food was edible. I wasn't impressed, per se, but I wouldn't put up a kicking and screaming fight to avoid returning.  I'll give it another shot some other time."}
{"text":"Okay, I really love Crescent, they have great food, great drinks, great shows, and it's all reasonably priced. Yesterday I got a bean and cheese burrito with chips for only $3 as part of Happy Hour pricing. Plus, they bring 2 salsas to your table, the orange one is my favorite. They probably made one of my favorite amaretto sours there, ever, it was just right.   I've seen quite a few bands play here and there's always good musicians there and the quality of the system they have is always good."}
{"text":"Man, I wish we had a place like this where I'm from. I went on a Sunday night and it was fairly packed. The drinks are reasonably priced and they had some awesome live music."}
{"text":"I love this place on so many levels. First, the food.   Cocina 10 is not bar food - it's outstanding Mexican food that is very vegan friendly. The chips and salsa are some of the best in town. The salsa is not too spicy but full of flavor. I can't decide if I like the red or green better, so I tend to just eat too much of both. They really need to bottle it and sell it for home consumption! Sometimes when I get it to-go they give me big bowls of each, and I implode with happiness.   This isn't a \"throw a bunch of cheese on it and call it Mexican food\" kind of place. Instead, it offers thoughtful, inspired dishes that use fresh ingredients. My normal go-to is the Poquito bean burrito (serve with a Mr. Bean sticker), made vegan with no cheese and added rice. It's a simple burrito - nothing too fancy - but perfect. They grill it to crisp up the tortilla a bit. As a result, the tortilla is still soft, but nice and warm. It's served with chips so I can consume even more salsa. It's my favorite burrito in town. The veggie tacos and veggie burrito are also good options that are vegan by default. The guac side is also vegan, but if you get the guac appetizer it has cheese. I also really like their iced tea! Service is always just fine, and to-go orders have been handled with perfect. My only suggestion is that they not charge me for adding rice to the burrito since I'm leaving off the cheese, but that's a typical vegan problem (we're always overcharged for substituting less expensive ingredients). It's only 50 cents so it's not really an issue.  The concert venue is also outstanding. I'm past my mosh-pit prime, so having bleacher seating at the back is perfect for me (but I can still join the pit when compelled to do so). The stage is wide and elevated enough so that you can still see the band while standing in the back. The sound system at the Crescent is exceptional - for both loud rock shows and quieter acoustic shows. It's a great size for smaller touring bands or local shows. They also have decent air conditioning - which is important for summer shows in Phoenix! The only exception was the Jonathan Richman show a few years back, where he made them turn the air off because he didn't like the sound.   I really appreciate what the Crescent Ballroom has brought to downtown Phoenix - both from a music culture and dining perspective. Downtown has been a wasteland for smaller, indie concerts since I moved here 20 years ago, and Crescent spearheaded a revival for scene that has seen fits and starts over the years, turning the indie music scene into a sustainable venture. The addition of related smaller (Valley Bar) and larger (The Van Buren) venues has made downtown a place to see and be seen after the businesses close, the ball games end and the symphony goers have headed off for a night cap. It's leading the way to what downtown cultural centers should be - diverse, interesting and full of energy (and good food)."}
{"text":"Really like this bar. It's very hipster, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just some information for those who think Yelp is God. I love the setup of this place. Nice little patio outside on both sides, average-sized bar area, and then a separate room for shows. I really like seeing shows here. The sound system is great and they even have an area to sit if you don't feel like standing. The drinks are cheap and strong. I've only had their salsa (very good) so can't say much about the food, but I've heard good things. The music is always popping here and Sean Watson makes me smile when he goes on. He played Chromeo's \"Tenderoni\" one time when I was there and I danced so hard I nearly vomited.  If there's a spot you should hit when downtown, it's Crescent."}
{"text":"Great vibe and lounge-like with live music is also well paired with eats that's not just grub food either but rather palatable options, especially after a tad bit of tequila.  This is an intimate space and do if times well to get your type of music I'm sure this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Been looking to check this place out. Good drink, Honey Badger, hubby hit a couple different IPA's. Lalo Burger served medium with sharp cheddar, grilled onions and Anaheim peppers, was amazingly seasoned, best burger I've had in a long time. Good Artisan bun, no basic bun here. Going to see Banana Gun, Pistoleros, Black Moods and Dead Hot Workshop! Neat little venue, good way to spend Thanksgiving Eve."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4 stars, but the service fell short on more than one occasion. The food was great, and the entertainment they have visiting this place is awesome. Everything from local to national acts. I've made a couple group outings to this location with co-workers and on a fairly dead time of the day. The idea was that we wouldn't be competing for service since there was only one other table to tend to, but was I wrong. It took us over an hour for 8 of us to get our food and there were multiple occasions  where I would have loved to get another drink but it literally took 20 minutes to get a draft or mixed drink. I'd gladly go back, if the bartender is Alaina. She was awesome and very prompt. But keep in mind if you sit on the patio, the trend is 'out of site out of mind.'"}
{"text":"Friday nights are awesome . There is a dj playing old school soul and funk on 45s/ vinyl. This is real cool because it attracts an older crowd and it is always dope to go to a place where they play stuff you dont hear on the radio. Much respect to CB... but the only thing I didnt like was that the dj stopped playing after an hour... not sure why. It was supposed to last all night."}
{"text":"Nice, large new venue, & decently priced. Sorry Marquee, I dont care to pay $25.00 to see local bands play.  Lots of seating in the front bar and a pretty nice patio. Loved that there is seating in the actual venue AND that if you use it, you can still see the bands!  they have some pretty tasty cocktails on the menu here that are available at the bar inside the actual venue or the regular bar.  The staff seemed to be very courteous, even w/ it being SO busy while we were there.  Depending on who's playing, we'll likely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect venue for seeing bands perform in an intimate setting. I have seen many of my favorite artists perform here, and it is crazy how close I can get to the stage without feeling claustrophobic. It is also great to enjoy food and drinks in the first room before a show. I recommend their burger - delicious! Parking is easy to find in the area, some meters as well as residential parking a block away."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here last night for Trivia Night! Had a blast! Service was good, the food was great we had Nachos with Barbacoa it was yummy! I really enjoyed the chips the were light and very fresh, guacamole was delish, I'm a fan! He had a Tinga Taco it was tasty, I had a blackened Talapia Taco soo good! They have Old school Hip Hop on Fridays we will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Crescent - it's one of my resident third places.  They get great headliners and put on a wonderful two-day music festival for Dias de la Crescent in the summer (I sincerely hope this becomes a standing music festival in the Valley.)  I went to the Halloween Ball and New Year's Eve party where there was free cover and some terrific DJs.  The staff is terrific - the bouncers do a great job with crowd control and you can always get a bartenders attention.  Bathrooms are always clean and the lines usually move pretty quickly.  Drinks are reasonably priced ($4 g&ts) and they make some wonderful house creations such as the \"Honeybadger.\"  Also, it attracts a great blend of people. You can wear just about anything and fit in.   I have so many fond memories of this place and will continue to frequent it.  Crescent Ballroom is one of the coolest venues in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is funny.  First order of business is sangria with cinnamon-- yes please.  It's always full of characters that I usually meet at the bar or in line for the bathroom...Criss Angel wannabes, some dude in a giant bear costume, men with German accents, my favorite waiter from Hula's...and that's the other thing, I feel like I run into people I vaguely know here, which is fun because I feel like I haven't really found that sort of place elsewhere in Phoenix.  The drawback is I'm never sure if I'm supposed to talk or dance or listen to the band, but maybe I'm just going at a weird time in the night slash overthinking this whole going out business."}
{"text":"I love everything about crescent ballroom, and I wish every band in phoenix came through here. Seriously. Everything is great. Perfect. Awesome. I love crescent!!!"}
{"text":"Oh hey there awesome music venue. You host amazing local and big time artists on top of serving ridiculously good food?! Yeah, I'm gonna be a regular.   This place is the best thing to happen to downtown Phoenix since....I don't know, the invention of misters. Seriously, if you enjoy live music, great people, and delicious food, then this is the place for you. I love the diversity in musicians that they are able to book and their friggin tortas are out of this world. Not to mention, the rice pudding is the best I've ever had - and I'm a Latin woman who loves rice pudding. So please don't take this lightly. This. Is. The. Bomb. Rice. Pudding.   I love it here. I bring all of my out of town friends here. And I hope this never closes down because if it does, I'm moving."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe and great people and drinks.  This is my absolute favorite music venue.  It can get a little loud in the dining area, and it's almost always crowded when we go, so seating isn't always optimal.  However, the food and ambiance make up any shortcomings.  We go sometimes just for the guacamole - definitely some of the best I've ever had in my life.    I also love the seating inside the venue itself - it's comfortable and intimate.  I've seen a few of my favorite acts here and every time I always leave happy with the venue, the management, and the crowd.  It's a great location and I wish there were more venues like this.  I'm glad Phoenix has something like this to boast."}
{"text":"It is the third or fourth time that we've come here and we were never disappointed. The few times that we came was a Saturday night for a concert, so we would get one or two drinks before and enjoy our night in the back room. But this Monday we decided to come for happy hour, their house craft beer is actually very good, and $3 for a pint, what a deal! They have their chips&salsa for $1! Seriously $1, who can beat that? My boyfriend and I decided to get the Lalo Burger, honestly the best burger we've ate in a long time! Their patio is very very very nice, love the high tops. I highly recommend this bar in Downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"All bartenders here suck except the girl with long blonddish hair. They treated me with merciless disdain, from non eye contact to pithy judgements over a drink. Fuck these assholes. The woman was the only non ornery person, and made me a drink with care, and worrying about that was going into it. When I went back to pick up my card and was patiently waiting, and after finally being acknowledged said politely, I'm waiting for her (other bartender) they said as if I was brain dead, oh she's waiting on other customers, which they were as well. I wanted to wait for her purposely since she hadn't been a dismissive asshole (and wanted to tip her) left wanting to murder the other staff. Hate the assholes, liked everthing else, and you guys get a shit score overall from me. NEVER coming back I hate you. Didn't try the food. atmosphere a resounding EH. Only caught the true horrible vibes from the bartenders who couldn't be bothered. I have a personal fuck you for those 2 can't-be-bothered assholes. Get out of customer service, you dim fucks."}
{"text":"Crescent Ball room is all about the atmosphere. If you want to go eat decent tacos, have a draft beer, and chill, this is the place to go. Wednesday is $2 taco special day, so be prepared to wait for a seat. It's a nice location with good vibes. Wish the barbacoa was more tender."}
{"text":"After 2 shows now, both on holidays, i have to say i dig this place.  The service is decent, there is rarely a wait for the bathrooms, and there are not one but 2 smoking patios.  I have been waiting for a great music venue downtown and now I have one.    PLEASE DON'T FUCK IT UP!"}
{"text":"Me: How long have you guys been open? Bartender: About... four hours.  Do you know how cool it is to go to a music venue on opening night? Very, very, cool. Why? Because everything is new. EVERYONE is new: guests, bartenders, bouncers and all. And the regulars? They don't exist yet.  Last night, I had the distinct pleasure of attending the Blind Pilot concert for Crescent Ballroom's opening night. The opener, Dan Mangan, can forever take pride in being the first band to play on their stage. Lucky dudes.  The venue itself has a neat layout. They have an outdoor patio with huge operable windows that open up into a hang out bar with comfy booths and tables. Just past this room, they have the main performance space, which has three levels of viewing: 1- for up close and personal: on-floor standing directly in front of the stage or seating off to the left 2- for non-dancers or folks who are tired of standing: bleacher seating at the back wall 3- for luxury drinking: on-floor tables or at-the-bar seating inside the performance space  The bartenders are kick ass and thoughtful. Kick ass because they provide quick and friendly service. Thoughtful because they provided me with a super tasty drink on the fly. It went like this...  Me: \"What's your most citrusy drink?\" Bartender: \"Hm, I could do a citrusy rum or vodka.\" Me: \"You decide.\" Bartender: \"How about a fresh squeezed mango lemon drop, on the rocks?\"  Citrus perfection.  The surreal-in-a-good-way lighting may or may not make you feel like you are traveling through time, just saying. The sound is pretty good. I like that the speakers hang from the ceiling. And when you're bladder needs a little break, check out the spotless bathrooms (or hopefully still spotless, since it was opening night and all).  To end the night, Blind Pilot performed their final song, \"3 Rounds and a Sound,\" on the floor, unplugged, because \"it's just that kind of venue.\" Such an intimate and cozy place. Do visit, especially since they have some good bands coming through soon. In fact, I will already be back next week to see the Blitzen Trapper and Dawes concert."}
{"text":"Definitely the best small venue in Phoenix I went to when I lived out here. They also serve pretty awesome Mexican food, which elevates this place to an entirely new level of greatness."}
{"text":"Great place but the employee tonight in the red crescent ballroom shirt is completely rude and was out of line. Doors opened at 7 for the get up kids, it was 7:10 so we walked in (with wristbands on) once inside we asked him if it's open yet l, his response was \"sure I guess signs don't mean anything anymore do they?\" In an extremely rude and condescending tone. If we didn't want to see the band so bad we would have left right then and there."}
{"text":"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music.   Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman.   The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!  Thank you Charlie!  Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!  btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment)."}
{"text":"Every Monday I'm here for their happy hour prices that run all day. It's my lunch spot. Tacos (go for the fish, tinga chicken or barbacoa) are 2 dollars each and come with fresh griddled corn tortillas. Can't go wrong with the bean dip either. The tacos are meaty - you'll be full with 2. It's especially nice now that the weather has turned towards fall and the patio is open. It's really one of the best lunches downtown."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to say how needed the Crescent Ballroom was in Phoenix. It's about time we had a nice, amazing small music venue where I can see all my favorite bands and not break the bank. I can even try out bands I haven't heard before. All in an intimate setting where I can be so close to Ra Ra Riot that my photos make me look as if I was part of the press.  I find myself going to so many more shows than I did before, and I get to have a burrito while I'm there too. Who doesn't want a burrito while they're at a show? NO ONE. And you can order it without leaving the concert space, because there's a bar in the back.  Most of the space is standing room, but there are bleachers in the back too and some small tables also. The sound is amazing and I've never once been to a show I didn't like.   I'm in love."}
{"text":"This is the venue downtown phoenix has been waiting for! Go for a show, or just to chill in the lounge and down a cocktail or two! The food is also spot on, and the service is as good as it gets! The owners went all out on the sound system and the acoustics in the main room and in the lounge... this place was built for MUSIC!   PS. Try the Honey Badger!"}
{"text":"I happened to find out about this place because a favorite local band of mine was having a release party show at the venue right after it opened. I didn't make that show, but was familiar with the name of the venue the second time that band played, and showed up not knowing what to expect.  I love the ambiance of this place. You get to really see the band up close and personal, and the sound is phenom. The environment is great for local bands and there isn't a bad spot in the place.  Drinks were awesome, and the food was fantastic (and not as expensive as I had anticipated. Hell, I hadn't anticipated food, period, given it was a music venue). But of course the food would be great, considering the kitchen is overseen by Chris Bianco, who is responsible for the masterpiece that is Pizzeria Bianco.  Can't say enough good stuff about this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is all I've heard about since moving here.  I don't get it.  I mean, it was fine.  It's a bar with a venue in the back for shows.  We were in the front portion of the place and the patio being as how there was an event in the back.  But perhaps you have to be AT the show to experience the place.  I mean, there was a patio.  Cool.  However the hipsters on the pation were smoking like chimneys and it was disgusting. Take your skinny jeans and cigs and go be cool out on the sidewalk. Smoking is gross.. haven't you got the memo yet?  We went inside and danced when the DJ started, but the 'dance floor' is releatively small.  Overall its a good bar, but I just don't get the hype."}
{"text":"I have only been to Crescent to see live music, never for food. But if you're looking for a fun venue to check out a new band, this place is great. It provides an intimate setting to see music and it's easy to get up close to the band if that's your style. It is a bit of a \"hipster\" scene, but that makes the people-watching more fun. Also, the drinks are fairly priced. I'd like to go back for Trivia night and to try some food."}
{"text":"Finally. A downtown mid-sized venue that caters to great, independent music artists. Add some incredible Mexican street fare to the mix and Crescent Ballroom should rocket to the top of most folks' \"try list\".  The establishment is on the small side- so expect large crowds and little room to navigate when top acts are performing. A small patio area gives way to the hipster inspired interior. I mean, there's PBR cans selling by caseloads- need I say more? The \"dining\" area seats maybe 50 on a good day so it's a little packed. If you can find time to get to CB early and order some food, do it. It's divine. Incredible way to soak up some of the alcohol you may be ingesting, and your taste buds will thank you.  Walk through the dining area, past double doors, and into the \"stage\" area. For the most part- standing room only with some cascading bleachers lining the back wall (those seats go fast every time). There's another small bar area in the stage room and even serves some basic food (tacos, burros, nachos). The acoustics are great, not really a bad spot in the entire room. It can get a little hot/stuffy so dress smart - especially in the warmer months. You're not far from the artists- so this is definitely to be considered an \"intimate\" setup.   There's a parking lot near the venue (3 minute walk) and costs $4 (exact change required). Other than that there are metered spots all along 2nd Ave. (free on weekends and evenings) and plenty of \"free\" parking within blocks of the joint. You may have to walk a bit to get to CB, but only if you arrive late (on time).  Staff is pleasant, and helpful. But you'll be coming back for the music, food, and drinks. I would definitely rank CB as simply a great place to hang out with friends. The music makes the place on the louder side so don't expect deep conversations, but you can still get your point across. Besides, you're there to listen to Iron & Wine, Twin Shadow, St. Vincent, Yeasayer, Tallest man on Earth, and Grimes anyway right? The CB web site is well done- make sure to bookmark and keep your eye on the artist calendar. There are constant reasons to keep coming back and the general price of tickets is always reasonable ($8-$20 depending on the act).  have fun!"}
{"text":"You're probably not coming here by choice. You're probably coming here because your favourite band is playing here and you would go to anywhere your favourite band is playing, right?  But this really is a place that makes an effort to bring you back (and I have!). From the polite bouncers to the engaging ticket collector, from the servers to the bartenders, everyone is nice here. it's a refreshing change.  Food is good but not great. It's Mexican food and there is no shortage of that around here. Drinks are cold, service is quick, acoustics are good for the bands.  I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic music venue. Fine drinks. Great patio space. Highly enjoy the look. The bathrooms aren't jacked up.   I don't have much else to say, honestly.   I just really love Crescent Ballroom."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is great. The people are friendly and the food is great. Oh... and not to mention the delicious thirst quenchingg drinks too"}
{"text":"It really doesn't get any better than Crescent! I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...  Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps?   This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.  Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park.   They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft.   I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!  I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!"}
{"text":"Terrific place to see a live show... the venue is smallish and easy to see the stage from everywhere. They even have some raised seating against the wall for people that can't see over the crowd or don't want to stand. Nice to see Phoenix area getting a venue that seems more SF or Seattle and is booking solid bands."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to check out a show at Crescent this week.  Must admit, I was anxious the place would be engulfed with young indistinguishable hipsters, especially considering I went to an indie-pop show, but that wasn't the case at all.  Nice range of ages & genres while maintaining a very cool vibe.  I like the different layers Crescent offers: the music venue inside, the middle area that doubles as a lounge and casual Mexican restaurant, and the patio with nice long community tables where folks can chill out and people watch.  The mixed drinks were too homogenized for me, weak in flavor and potency, but there's a full bar so plenty of poisons to pick from.   The show was great-- AND I ran into one of the coolest Elite Yelpers I'd never met before! A very cool addition to DT Phoenix."}
{"text":"Crescent is definitely one of my favorite venues for shows but their lounge is great as well. They have small but comparable drink menu, I love the Four Peaks Peach Ale. As for appetizers I also go with their chips and salsa, a favorite snack of mine. It comes with fresh thick and crispy tortilla chips and two types of salsa. One is a salsa verde that is very fresh and delicious and the second is a red salsa that is spicy,  garlicky, and delicious! In the past I ordered their chicken tacos for dinner which were very good, last time I ordered their Sinaloa Seafood Chowder and I was wonderful! It came with perfectly cooked chunks of fish, shrimp, tomatoes and other yummy vegetables. My boyfriend always orders their bean and cheese burrito which he always loves. If you're going for a show definitely come early to catch a yummy bite to eat!"}
{"text":"This is the best Bar, Music Venue in the Valley!  The waitress, bartenders are really friendly and good with getting you your order fast and accurate.  The Atmosphere here is amazing.  The mexican food here is amazing!"}
{"text":"Sucks to go to during lunch time. Seriously waiting 45 minutes for a bean burrito. Their food is good but their customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We saw Robert Earl Keen and he was hilarious and fun. Great bar and really cool concert area. I was told they had an outdoor area too and would love to go see someone and have it be outside.  We had some good drinks and had a quesadilla as a snack. It was good bar food - not sure how you can mess up a quesadilla either.  Definitely will be back and hope its outside next time."}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced that moment where you realize you're not half as cool as you think you are? Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me.   The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.  This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right?   I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt.   The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.   They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though.   Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the \"hipster\" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't.   Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I want to give Crescent Ballroom 5 stars, but feel it very presumptuous of me considering I've only been once and I didn't have any of the food (although it looked delicious).   I recently attended a local music concert at Crescent and had a blast! What a cool venue. Perfect for local bands about to hit it big, mid-level national acts traveling through town or even a national act hoping to play a smaller gig. With the bleacher seating in the back of the room there was plenty of seating for those who didn't want to stand (or feet were too tired from dancing already). The sound was great, and although I had to yell at a friend while trying to have a conversation during one of the acts, I still could at least talk to her.   The beer selection was great and prices were moderate- it's about what I would expect to pay for a microbrew on a night out.   Crescent Ballroom is easily accessible- off 2nd Ave & Van Buren. Street parking is easy to find on surrounding streets.  When the show was over, I was a little dismayed to see the hipsters had overtaken the front lounge as I suddenly felt out of place (my jeans weren't tight enough), but everyone seemed to be having fun and it wasn't overly crowded. I'm really looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, but I absolutely love this place. It almost feels like a wine bar when you walk in- appropriately sparse lighting, hip decor, and an openness that beckons you to relax and enjoy. The staff doesn't feel like the airport TSA, which is a welcome change from comparable Phoenix venues.   Having access to real food at a show is a MAJOR plus. It's damn tasty, too.  Drinks are good, not great, but reasonably priced.   The best part: probably the best sound system of any venue I've ever been to- I could hear each instrument from each band member with crystal clarity, nearly perfect balance, and tonal accuracy. The stage is clean, large, and looks like a TV showcase.  Love."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a place I used to see shows at when I was younger.  It's a very small venue accommodating maybe 500 or so. I've been there about a dozen times. I've never eaten there except for this past week. I couldn't see the menu very well, it had some small print and I refuse to wear glasses... yeah, vain, I know. Anyway, I saw hamburger and confirmed that it would not have onions or pork. It had some kind of aioli and lightly sautéed green peppers. OMG, It was a delicious burger. That, and a few beers was like $20. The beer in the venue was $3.50. What? In a concert venue? I had a someone bad experience when they had a concert out back. Just a little disorganized. But, I am a fan of this place overall. Great job and it's nice to have live music in Phoenix, especially in a venue like this."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, good shows, questionable staff. The beer list clearly said beers were $5, when we went to pay we were charged $6. When I said something, they acted very offended and then were cold and charged us $6 when we ended up ordering another. I realize mistakes happen, but don't fault the customer for pointing it out."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best music venues in Phoenix!  I always go to shows here.  Almost anywhere you stand or sit you will have a good veiw.  The venue is nice and intimate.  If your hungry the food is also very tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually love to come here before a concert and have enjoyed their menu in the past.  Unfortunately, this last time was a bit of a miss.  After being told to sit anywhere we'd like, we went to take a table outside which hadn't been cleared of dirty silverware and water glasses.  That didn't bother us, but once we sat we were admonished to get up until someone has been able to clean it up.  So, we stood and waited for a several minutes, despite the fact that it was early and relatively slow, before deciding to just grab a table inside instead.  I ordered a beer - it was lukewarm.  My wife's tacos fell apart in her hands when she went to pick them up (perhaps sitting too long in their single layer corn tortilla).  We mentioned it to our waitress who simply responded \"duly noted - I'll let someone know\".  No attempt to rectify the situation was made.  While still eating, I needed to feed the meter outside and asked change a $5 bill for some quarters, only to be told \"we don't make change for the meters\"... OK, that's weird.  Fortunately, the bartending was willing to help me out from his tip jar.  We'll still come back, and hopefully our next experience and review will be better."}
{"text":"I frequent Crescent during their lunch usually around 1130 - noon and it's usually pretty busy. They have extended their dinning area to an upstairs which is awesome. However, they do not have shade in several areas. In AZ that's definitely a must or else you're just miserable. Also, lunch time is usually slower in service.  If you're a fan of salads you HAVE to try their Cocina 10 Ensalada. I usually get it with chicken and it's amazing! It's pretty large so I always take some to go.  I have them at 4 /5 stars and it'll be dropping as we continue wait... I'm currently here with the sun beating on me (15 minutes of waiting).   **UPDATE**  I'm happy with their happy hour but when it comes to their LUNCH time, their service is very slow.  Also, there is definitely not enough tables to accommodate everyone during this time.   Love this place but geeezzz. Get more servers and tables."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! I think they sold 2000 tickets for a 500 person venue. No room to move around. I had to wait in line for 20min just to move from the front part to the middle part of the venue. Then I had to wait another 10 min to get to the back. ....And now I just got kicked out for what I don't know. I asked the doorman what I did and he said \"I can't tell you\" I asked him again what I did so I don't do it again and his response was \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way\".... wow! Is this how an owner of a fine restaurant, \"Pizza Bianca\" runs an establishment? I'm sad to have to post this because I have heard nothing but good \"word of mouth\" about The Crescent. But after tonight I can see that they do not have a properly run business. THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!.... In my opinion."}
{"text":"What a great place! We sat on the patio, which was really nice to people watch. I'm not sure if there were hooks on tables or the bar rail, if so great, but if not, it would be nice because I had no where to put my purse. I had it sitting on the bar rail and it made me really nervous when a gentleman that was mumbling to himself came walking by.   I really liked the salsa and how they served it in squeeze bottles. I had the Pacific Chicken Burrito and I thought it was quite tasty and fresh. My daughter had a bean burrito and it looked very fresh. My husband had the Barbacoa bowl and he said it was good. We only had water to drink, because we were on our way to a musical and didn't want to be tired. But their drink menu looked promising for our return visit.   The prices just blew me away! I couldn't believe the chips and salsa were a dollar (happy hour) and my burrito was under nine dollars. Our entire meal including tip was $25.00. That's pretty unbelievable for an app, and three meals.   I should also mention that everyone we came in contact with was so nice! No pretentiousness to be found, and you've really gotta love a place like that, especially when you're a little older and you think a place only caters to the young and hip.   Can't wait to come back with just hubby or girlfriends and catch a show."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom is one of my favorite concert venues because of its intimate and laid back atmosphere. The sound system is excellent, and you can see the stage pretty well from most spots.   The staff is generally friendly--completely opposite from other local venues like the Marquee. Good happy hour specials for a bite or drink before a show."}
{"text":"Love Motown Mondays!  Lively even on Monday, we enjoy the funky and cool vibe of this old brick building..  Live music 7 nights a week gives you lots of chances dancing!   Try the mini churos, yummy!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place rocks. Great venue, pretty darn good drinks and food. Service is also pretty good and atmosphere (for Phoenix) is fantastic. Extremely hip, and has quite the variety of concerts. While I have not been inside the main stage area, you can here the music throughout the venue/restaurant.   Fantastic deals on happy hour- recommend the Honey Badger if you're a fan of ginger beer, ginger whiskeys, etc etc.   As always I wish the drinks were a bit stronger but that's just how bars go I'd say. My one complaint is that I was really hassled at the entrance on being 21. I have a CA vertical ID, so I guess in AZ that looks a bit suspicious, but seriously?! You need to go check for five minutes, make me move into the light, shine a flashlight in my face, and question me repeatedly? I get you have a job but bro, chill. Can't you just swipe it in the computer or something?  That being said, for having only been in the PHX area for a couple months, so far this is my favorite place for drinks."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and I love the salsa you get in the tubes!!!! This is my favorite favorite chill spot"}
{"text":"I thought it was really cheesy because they had plastic chairs all squeezed in close together making it awkward to dance."}
{"text":"A coworker and I came here for lunch today. The weather was nice so we took a seat outside on the patio. They could use more umbrellas on their tables, but we were able to grab some shade.   The service was a bit slow, but the food was fantastic.  I especially enjoyed the guacamole.  It was a huge portion, unlike some places.  My coworker got the carne asada tacos and I got the chicken tinga torta.  Both of us really enjoyed the food.   I will definitely come back here for lunch when I'm working downtown."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is a pretty cool venue for Phoenix! It has lovely ambience and a nice stage (standing room and nice spots to sit). They make tacos there that are some of the best I've had in the southwest (I ordered the fish tacos). The corn tortillas are so fresh and yummy! Also, they have the gluten free beer, Fox Tail which is a hard to find beer at most venues. Nice work guys!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hit before going to The Van Buren for a concert. Excellent torta. What's a torta you ask? When done right is is fresh Mexican roll a bit on the sweet side and soft with excellent beef or pork and veggies. This place did it well. Service? Well they were busy, we were rooftops and I'll say she was doing her best. Definitely another great downtown restaurant worth repeating."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing... If you don't like tacos then you should probably just go lay down on the light rail tracks."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom is one of the best concert venues in Phoenix. The set up is great, you walk in to a nice modern dining area where you can have pre-drinks and food before entering in to the actual venue.   The Ballroom itself is small, but well set up with stadium seating along the walls. The  under 21 area is also small and doesn't take away from the viewing pleasure of all the drunkards like some other places.   I have yet to try the food, but they do $5 beer and burritos on Fridays and I have heard rave reviews. This place rocks and I hope it stays this way. We need more venues like this in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"As one of my favorite places in Phoenix (to see a concert or otherwise) I wish I could write the perfect review for Crescent Ballroom. Alas, that is impossible because words don't really do it justice, but I'll still give it an attempt.  I have seen so many amazing shows at crescent and a lot of credit for these memorable experiences goes to the venue itself. There's not a bad seat in the house in the actual concert area. There's bleacher seating in the back if you're looking to chill and plenty of standing room if you're looking to dance like a maniac, spin around in circles, and jump till you drop.  Whenever somebody tells me that they haven't been to CB I immediately start gushing to them about the many great qualities about this place - music, people, food, atmosphere, ticketing, etc - and there are really very few places that I actively promote like I promote Crescent Ballroom.  At the end of the day, if you like music and/or cool bars and live anywhere in the Valley of the Sun, you have to give this place a try. Also, BEAN DIP!!!"}
{"text":"Good concerts nice vibe decent food though not a ton of choices . can be a bit pricey for a good cocktail but they do run some cheap beer specials . have seen some interesting stuff and shows here favorite part is showing up before a bigger concert and just seeing the bands hang out and have a drink or two and getting to mingle . got to meet manchester orchestra which was awesome ."}
{"text":"Hello everyone!  This venue is acoustically amazing and the food is very tasty!  Now , let's talk about the service.......... I have been to this venue 6 times, every time   I go I have subpar service!! Whether it's the server or the bartender there is this \"i don't give a fuck \" attitude about the customer!! Call me \"old school \", but businesses especially a food/entertainment establishment should pride itself on the customer experience!! I am not asking for a five star resturant or hotel experience , just a humble/ attentive basic customer experience!! I'm not going to name names but the servers here are way undertrained when it comes to the \"customer experience \" in my opinion. Take my order and be polite and accommodating  if need be. That's all I ask! But you will not even get that \"basic\" customer experience here!! Sad to say but this place is sub par at best and I can have a better experience at the rebel lounge or marquee theatre or even Club red!!! At least they are all about the customer!!! I have played many of these venues and I would never! Never !! Play this venue just based on how it's ran and the people are trained! What a joke!! Don't waste your hard earned dollar!!"}
{"text":"Here to see Mergence!!  Great show, amazing venue... excellent service.  Whats not to like!?"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back.  The layout of this place has a Oregon feel to it.  It just reminds me of the bars in downtown Portland.  I saw Nortec Collective here and the main stage layout has an intimate feel to it.  Anywhere you stand or sit you'll have a great view of the performers.  The sound system sounded great too.  I will definitly be coming back here in the near future."}
{"text":"I came to the Crescent Ballroom for a drink and to play trivia with some colleagues of Nicole H.'s, even though she was working, poor dear. Anyway, her colleagues are smart, and I figured this team that I'd landed on would just walk away with the prizes. Not. Unless one counts placing 13th as a win.  If you come here to partake, be prepared to be hammered by the trivia local experts. I'm not sure if these people just knew the category ahead of time and spent most of their waking hours memorizing little known facts about Arnold Schwarzenegger (the category that night). Whatever. It was fun.   The emcee will do a great job of keeping the game lively, and the waitstaff will do their part in serving drinks and appetizers.   I'm not sure what else happens at this location, but I am counting the days for a trip downtown for Trivia night again."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Cannot say it enough. Always friendly, super helpful and the venue rocks. The staff is awesome and the people interesting to look at. I always meet fun people there"}
{"text":"The venue itself is beautiful but please do something about your staff/security. Is it really neccassry to hire a bunch of wanna be cops/MMA fighters that eye fuck everyone? I get that some of the shows can get a little \"aggressive\" but the staff honestly seems to antagonize more than they actually do their jobs."}
{"text":"I have a fabulous time every time I come here ! A very relaxed venue with superb acoustics, and the bands who play here are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Blonde girl about no older than 30 was the most horrible server. Food was alright. Band playing next door was dope tho. My girl wanted to leave so we left. I wanted to see the band playing but they charge for that. ;/"}
{"text":"Ok. So I have lived in smaller cities that have excellent places to see live music & I have lived in large cities that have an awful live music scene & pretty much no-where for it to happen. I don't think people realize how good they have it here! This place is fantastic! There is a large dance area plus bleacher-style seating around the back wall so a person can sit but still see. The employees I encountered were all really nice, friendly, and helpful. I was on a rolling scooter when I went due to a recent surgery & everyone was accommodating (which shocked me since I WAS putting myself in the position of being in a crowded music venue), no one ran into me or fell on top of me, and I could see the bands the whole time. What I was most impressed about was that it was a 16+ show. My 17 year old little sister was in town visiting & wanted to go dancing & I couldn't find any other place other than the Crescent Ballroom that had a live show she could go to. Normally, I would have seen it as a negative to have a bunch of little kids at a show but the Crescent does a great job of keeping the under 21 separated AND they got to be right up front. Great idea! No alcohol directly up front, but outside of the little separator gate you can drink all you want. The only negative was that it did seem like there were a lot of complainey people in the crowd that didn't seem to want to be there. Weird. Maybe that's the cool thing with certain groups/ages- to go to things and pretend you don't like it but stay anyway. It was a pretty diverse crowd in general though, which is always great."}
{"text":"So in love with this place!!!! First of all you NEED to try the pacific burrito bowl, heavenly. Second, it's such a fun place to go dance on a Friday night. The music is always great and it's not like a club where everyone pushes and shoves. And every weekend I feel like they have a new theme, 2000 r&b hip hop night?? Um yesssssss! It's definitely one of my go to spots for sure."}
{"text":"Music is amazing!!! Crowd is cool... Bartenders are sooooo slow!!! Tried the front and back bar... Slow slow slow... Losing money not being able to turn out drinks faster"}
{"text":"I've seen some great bands at the Cresent ballroom. The fact that the food is top notch just adds to why we love this venue."}
{"text":"Live jazz on Tuesdays. Food was good. Not the best tacos I've had but the Barbacoa was the best. Nice Cocina 10 salad too. Service a little slow but friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite venues, very well managed. The bartenders are friendly and fast and they have a great selection of liquor. The food smells great but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"If I didn't live so far away, Crescent would probably be my regular hangout for just about anything - eating, drinking, live music, whatever.  Sure, it's pretty hipsteriffic - but that's to be expected. The venue caters largely to local and indie music, but it's nothing like several other cheap, run-down shack \"venues\" in the valley (cough). It's new, clean, and fairly organized; a little small, but I prefer it that way, because I hate being in huge crowds at shows. I haven't heard of half the bands who come here, because I'm not that cool, but they'll have a bigger act once in a while, and the concerts I HAVE seen here are fantastic. Great sound, great views, and great atmosphere.  What has bothered me, unfortunately, is the service at the bar and patio. Both times I've been here and ordered food and drinks, I've been pretty frustrated with how inattentive the servers are. Yes, we get it, you're busy - but I've worked in the restaurant biz, and all I can say is that if you can't handle it, don't be a server. Being busy is not a good excuse to forget to bring items, make us wait 15 minutes for checks after asking, and then screw up said checks. Something along these lines has happened on each visit. Might just be bad luck. I'd really love to come here sometime when it's not packed before a show, because the food and drinks are surprisingly good. It looks like they have some great specials throughout the week, too.  But negatives aside, Crescent is fun, reasonably priced, and refreshingly different. I like the set-up (the venue being separate from the dining area/bar/patio, plus both standing and sitting areas for shows) and the relaxed environment. Overall it's a chill place to hear some good tunes and hang out with friends. It's like a breath of fresh air amongst a sea of dark, dingy, overpriced venues in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Respectable southwestern restaurant by day, intimate indie venue by night. Crescent is the spot for shows too big for a cramped little shack like Trunk Space, but too small for one of those uncontrollable, rowdy venues like Marquee.   I came here early for a Cold War Kids show and hit the bar. If anyone has ever done some drinking at a concert, you'll appreciate prices here. $5 for a 12 oz craft beer is more than fair, I've paid tons more for a Bud freaking Light elsewhere. I indulged in the $2 \"Mystery Shot\". No regrets, I think it ended up being some sweet, flavored vodka. Just note that even *after* taking it, the bartenders are still in the dark about what it is. Just prepare for something different in case it's something crazy like pepper SoCo!  Anyways, the sound is top notch, it attracts a good crowd, and I have zero complaints whatsoever about my experience. You hear that, Crescent? You're PERFECT. Don't. Change. Anything."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue!  Clean.  Nice restrooms.  Not a bad place to sit or stand in the whole place.  I was here checking out some Lucha Libre wrestling recently and it was fantastic fun.  Yeah,  nobody really got hurt, but we sure had fun pretending that they did.  I didn't get to try the food, so I can't comment on that, but I would definitely be back for another performance."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make.   I am... A hipster. It's happened. And ya know what? I'm okay with it.   We came here last night in search of PBRs and live music. We got that. And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:  \"Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing.\"  And then someone else says:  \"Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!\"  So awesome. So 2001.  The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped.   Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.  One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line."}
{"text":"Oh loneliness and burritos are a dangerous combination.  I came here for the Halloween Ball as this is one of the places with no cover and a good location. I like this place. I like the way the red brick gently caresses the wood paneling on the outside while the lighting just softly kisses the sign on the wall. Well, I suppose enough of that soft-core design porn. Let's go into the hard-core stuff.  We got here kind of early and the atmosphere was pretty friendly. Talked to a few people on the outdoor patio that overlooks beautiful 1st Ave. Or the parking structure across the street anyways.   Service was decent to start. Waitress was attentive but no where to be found when we were leaving. Had to ask three different people for her. It was a busy night so I let it slide.   Food wasn't mind blowing, a little pricy for what's in their burrito, but the drinks were strong and reasonably priced.   The ballroom was pretty awesome. There's a second bar in the ballroom and transferring your tab is no problem. Sound system was pretty kickin' and ample seating. I'm going back for a few shows.    WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN A++ SELLER I mean BALLROOM!"}
{"text":"Great venue, there is seating for those who don't like to stand and a whole lot of standing areas.  We came here early and our friend suggested we eat at the bar in front turned out they have amazing burritos! We have had the chicken, carne asada, and al pastor.. one as good as the next.  Their salsas they serve with it is out of this world.  Their drinks are also well mixed and very tasty.  My personal favorite is the Honey Badger.  We will likely be looking out for more shows for this venue from now on."}
{"text":"Amazing does not begin to describe this resultant/bar/venue. Upon first glance, the gastro pub seems to be a small but cool little restaurant and bar with good outdoor seating.   Once one passes through the second door, however, the real magic takes hold. Behind the second door is a heathy sized concert area and large bar draped across the back wall.   So many great shows have been enjoyed here by myself. It's a wonderful venue that gives an intimate feel to every show.  If you do decide to eat you will not be disappointed. The guacamole is amazing and the southwest salad will always treat you right."}
{"text":"Been to crescent once and loved how intimate the concerts are.It's not your biggest venue so be aware of standing next to people. If you love your space then you might not enjoy it so much. When watching a show the seats are benches/bleachers not chairs. The lighting is dark and very chill and the concerts are somewhat intimate!"}
{"text":"What fantastic people! Met the general manager and she couldn't be more genuine. Not to mention helpful. I had a question about the place she couldn't answer, and she took my number and said she would find out and let me know. Gosh."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best music venue in all of AZ. They have a constant flow of amazing bands and artists, their food is delicious (you can't go wrong with a burrito conceptualized and created from the chef/owner of Pizzeria Bianco), their drinks are poured and priced right, and the staff is typically very friendly. Sound quality during the shows is always right on, and the space itself is really nice. Definitely not dingy or a dirty hole-in-the-wall like a few other PHX music venues.  The only downside I can think of is that parking can be an issue. Try to get there early and you won't have to drive around looking for a space too long."}
{"text":"First time going to Crescent and really enjoyed the smaller venue. The artists interacted great with the crowd. The drinks were reasonably priced with quick service. Seating for those who don't want to stand but everyone has a view. Come early and grab some food on the front patio or inside. Overall a fun experience and will definitely be coming back, can't believe I waited so long to show up."}
{"text":"Wow, really impressed with this place. The barbacoa tacos were phenomenal!! Juicy, succulent, savory.  I also ordered their version of a margarita, Which has a little but of orange in it. It was super delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"The food is good ,drinks are good and seeing a show here is the best venue I have ever been to. Its small but not to small. The shows are always great and 90% of the time the artist will hang out at the mech booth and take photos/sign things.   They give you free soda if your driving your friends that are drinking. Which I love! They support not drinking and driving. If its an all age show they rope all the under 21 in a small area. So you can sit in the stand (they have a area to sit! that doesn't ruin your view). I buy tickets to see any band that is just ok , because I know it will be a relaxing great time coming here."}
{"text":"I love coming to Crescent mostly because I get to hang out with loved ones when I'm here. My bf's hipster brother lives closeby and we don't get to see him often, so I've always had a good time catching up with him here. We've always sat outside in the patio area and I love it. You can hear the live music from outside but you can still have a conversation without yelling. The servers are super friendly and always bring drinks out fast. I recommend getting some trail mix to munch on with some beers."}
{"text":"Great venue for bands. Small enough to feel intimate but still an awesome sound. I like the division of bodies at all ages shows...Mama do like to get boozy. Doorman Grady is THE BEST and really keeps things in order."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom seems to metamorphose appropriately depending on the act on stage and the temperament of the crowd.  Having taken in two shows midweek on several occasions, I can only imagine how it will continue to evolve with time.  But suffice it to say that any place where the diversity of the species (musical and otherwise) can coexist in peace deserves a try, especially in SandLand."}
{"text":"Mix and match $3 tacos were bomb! The tingo chicken tacos were my favorite.. super tasty and fresh corn tortillas, can't go wrong. Beer and cocktail list is pretty good. I went on a Sunday evening when trivia was taking place. I'll be back to watch a show here!"}
{"text":"Such a fun little place. Their tacos and guacamole are frickin amazing. Especially the tacos. Bean dip was also great! Saw Naughty by Nature here and was so much fun hanging out and seeing them up close and personal. Vibe is super chill."}
{"text":"Good food, good drink selection - can't complain about that.  Then you walk into the venue, and it's all sorts of fantastic.  Bleacher seating if you wanna chill. Places to put your food and drink if you want to mill about.  The place is pretty small so if your favorite band comes through here it's a MUST that you check them out - very intimate.  Another bar towards the back is pretty accessible and the bathrooms are never a hassle."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great small to medium-sized venue.  It is a good reason to experience downtown Phoenix.  You can take the light rail right to Van Buren and Central, and it is only two very short city blocks west.  There are many restaurants within walking distance, so it was easy to make a whole night of going to a show.  The show we saw was sold out, and yet it was very comfortable to be inside.  There was plenty of room to see the bands, and you could easily get a drink at the bar without too long of a wait or extra effort.  The drinks were priced reasonably.  I drank Tanqueray and tonic for $6 each and the wife had Stella Artois for $5 each.  The cheapest drinks were cans of PBR for $3 each.  They serve food, but we had just eaten at the Arrogant Butcher-- however I have heard they have a decent kitchen from a well respected source.  The floorplan is set up very well.  There are two entrances, east and west.  On the east side there is a lounge and dining area with restrooms and a bar.  Through a set of double doors is the stage area that has bleacher type seating in the back and plenty of standing room in the front.  The west entrance appears to be for the under 21 set during all ages shows.   Having the two entrances makes for a very quick and organized egress, which is convenient and safe.   There is a long bar along the west  wall, another set of restrooms, and an area dedicated for band merch, which was nice because we were able to talk to the opening act while they sold their own records and t-shirts.  The place is air-conditioned quite nicely.  The bathrooms were reasonably clean for how many people were there.  Overall this is a little gem in downtown Phoenix that makes me excited to get out and and actually be part of the small-but-great Phoenix night-life."}
{"text":"Love the venue. I catch a lot of live music and am always happy when bands are billed to play there."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch  The space is fun and the price is right at about $12 a person for lunch.  Service staff is cool and never leave you waiting for long.  The Arnold Palmer was perfect.  Space would not lend well to large groups of more than eight, though.    Short menu of food options.  Ordering two single tacos is just the right amount of food and are tasty, though the pork was a bit tough.  Others in our group liked the burgers and the burrito.  Fudge with chocolate sauce was a hit for our person celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"Came here for \"Motown on Mondays\" and can't complain!   The cover was FREE and they had live music and a DJ spinning old Motown classics with a little twist and some extra funk.   I ordered the \"Carne Asado Burrito\" (which came with tortilla chips on the side) and a \"Rest Stop\" to drink. The burrito was nothing short of AMAZING and the drink was just the right kind of strong.  This place will def be my go to for a Monday Night Date Night!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's a great spot to grab a bite before a show at Crescent Ballroom.  Expect it to be loud if a show has already started, but you'll still appreciate the atmosphere.  Old movies play on the wall, the bar is accessible, and, if it's not too hot, there's a sizable patio.  On our first visit, we waited longer than we'd like for service and menus after seating ourselves.  After flagging down a busboy, he delivered on his promise to get our server over quickly and came back to explain that they'd just had a rush of close-outs.  Once our server appeared, we ordered two cocktails:  a Coronado Ice Water and a Honey Badger.  The Honey Badger, a tasty mix of whiskey, lime, and ginger beer, was great but the Coronado Ice Water was a little hard to stomach - too sour and not enough flavor to complement the taste of tequila.    We also ordered guacamole and chips as an appetizer and the poquito bean and cheese burrito and al pastor burrito.  Food came out quickly and, in contrast with our initial service, the server came back fairly regularly to check in on us.  The guacamole was delicious, topped with cotija and featuring segments of orange that lend a pleasant sweetness to the guacamole.  The chips were crunchy and thick, perfect for scooping guacamole.  The burritos are by no means the best in the Valley, but are palatable.  They are a good size and well-rolled, making them easy to manhandle.  The tortillas are substantial and have good texture and flavor.  I added rice and jalapenos to the poquito bean and cheese burrito and was pleased to discover the jalapenos were fresh, not pickled.  There was a good balance between the beans, rice, and cheese, but not a lot of spice throughout even with the addition of jalapenos.  In the future, I might try to use salsa or hot sauce to add some flavor.  The al pastor was tender but perhaps a little too sweet; the pineapple flavor is definitely not lost in the mix.  Mixed with refried beans, it makes for a slightly messier, but still manageable, burrito than the poquito,    Overall, I'd definitely recommend Cocina 10 if you're at Crescent for a show or need a late night bite (they're open until midnight every night), but would not make a point to stop in for food otherwise.  Although the menu bears the stamp of Chefs Chris Bianco and and Doug Robson (Gallo Blanco), it doesn't hold a candle to their own restaurants' fare."}
{"text":"The closest thing to L.A. in Phoenix!  I went here with my hubby for Jen Deveroux Animal Royale fashion show. (Jen is this super cute little pink haired chica that I just wanted to invite over for tea!)  Hubby & I arrived a bit early so we ordered a drink and sat in a small table.   I was THRILLED that they had a Vanilla Bean rice pudding on the menu, so I ordered it!  The waitress was polite and brought me this big plastic bowl with a plastic spoon and it was FILLED with rice pudding!!! And it was only $3!!  It was DELISH!! My tastebuds soared!! I was sooo happy consuming this delight!  Anyway.... The 3 people at the table next to us were super friendly and we all chatted.  In fact, everyone at this place seemed super friendly and uber fun! The crowd was this beautiful eclectic mix of gay/lesbian, punk/rock/biker/techno peop's with lots of fun and cool hairstyles, make up and fashion.  We had a great time and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Downtown needed a place like this for so long! Cool hang out, live music, good food.  The combination of the three are an obvious marriage - Congratulations Crescent Ballroom, you're an instant success !"}
{"text":"I saw Jarabe de Palo here last night. The place was awesome, small venue and they have a good collection of bands going through it. Also, i loved that they had a water jug out, so for the non alcohol drinkers, you dont ahve to dedal with the lines at the bar and you can serve yourself!"}
{"text":"the food is! burritos, salsa, tacos, and burgers are the greatestalso the local bands, dirty Disney and and 90's hip hop night definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming but was very disappointed last time I came in which was last night. Went in at midnight and was immediately told at the door that it was last call soon. We got our drinks went outside and the security guy kept harassing us to drink up fast cause they're closing early due to it being slow. We only stayed there for 20 min and in that duration he told us 3 times to leave. The last time he told us he said we have to drink fast now and leave basically chug and go.  Told him to give us 5 min as our drinks were almost done and we were speeding it up anyhow. 5 min later he came back again. Absolutely inappropriate and rude, never coming back and spreading the word."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Phoenix.  Great shows, fantastic free events, awesome specials, tasty food, and great cocktails.  And they just added an upstairs patio!  If you're going to a show, I recommend buying tickets in advance at the venue to avoid a service fee (as long as you're not trying to buy tickets when they're super busy).   The day of the event, plan on getting there early for a taco or burrito - you won't regret it.    There's metered parking on the street or a $5 lot around the corner (bring cash)."}
{"text":"New Years here is so much fun! Nothing but fun really. This year was bigger than last so it was nearly impossible to get a drink but I didn't mind, I just continued dancing. I am sure by next year they will account for all of the people and add in more areas to get drinks."}
{"text":"It's hipsteriffic.   I knew by the way the tenspeeds were racked that this would be a PBR-and-plaid sort of place, and I wasn't disappointed.  What I liked about it: The DJ was loud as hell but isolated to the front lounge section. If there's no band playing in the ballroom part, one can wander back there to have an actual conversation. Also, no cover.  What I didn't like about it: I don't think there was much vodka in that vodka tonic.  Still, not a bad place to hang out. Some nice eye-candy and it's within walking distance to Seamus McAffrey's and Hanny's."}
{"text":"This venue works as a bar, a restaurant and for live music. We went for drinks and to see Billy Bragg play. I really enjoyed myself from the moment we got here. Great people watching, good drinks, good service, and the show was top notch (lighting and sound). I will return to sample the grub soon."}
{"text":"Whether I'm here to see a show or not, I'm a pretty big fan of Crescent. It's become the default downtown bar for my friends and I, actually.  I'm a pretty big fan of live music, and whoever is booking shows at this place is doing a great job. It's a medium sized venue, and they do a pretty good job of finding bands that will fill the place, but that generally won't sell out in 10 minutes. (They cater to the local music & indie-rock crowd, mostly.) The shows generally range from $8 - $15, depending on who's playing.  One of the things I really like is that they have a front bar & patio that you can hang out  and have drinks, and not go into the show so you don't have to pay a cover. (they have inner doors separating the show area front the front bar area.)  Yes, this place tends to draw a more indie-hipster crowd than, say, a scottsdale bar... but I've always found the crowd to be enjoyably diverse in both age & style. I mean, I'm a 31 yr old dude that wears jeans & button-down shirts, and I've never been shunned or mocked by a gaggle of skinny-jean wearing ruffians. (also, a lot of it depends on what bend they have playing that day.) And, there's always plenty of cute girls. So there's that.  (last note: drink prices are pretty standard. $5 bucks for a Guinness, $4 or $5 for a cocktail. God knows for PBR. No one should drink that swill. Also, if they have Sangria, beware - taste great, good price, not much booze.)"}
{"text":"Quick lunch with my manager before flying out of Phoenix. Good food; Mexican ambiance. Guac was the best I've ever had... Veggie taco over pork taco over fish taco"}
{"text":"I saw Volcano Choir here last night. It's my first time visiting Phoenix, and this was just part of an all-around great experience. Excellent venue. Intimate and on the small side, but never crowded (it was a sold-out show). Staff was friendly, and everyone I encountered was courteous and behaved themselves.  It made for a spectacular show."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place!This Place is wonderful! If My husband and I have nothing to do and wants to go somewhere fun and pleasant this is our #1 choice because we are never disappointed the Food,drinks,location and mostly the Music is great This bar is Comfortable very casual and there Is always good Music there,this is the place to be people I highly recomend this place go Go !!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Drinks a bit pricey. Not strong but for the price I'd like to get a buzz going on faster...  Seen a few shows here and love the acoustics. Great for intimate shows.  Will be back! Might not drink but, I'm a sucker for live music!"}
{"text":"Love this place for food, happy hr and the occasional concert. I even went to their New Years feat and always have a good time. Pastor tacos are awesome and the beer is nice and cold. Service is great and the people are all greatly diverse without the hipster attitude. A must spot to go if you hang around Phoenix"}
{"text":"My favorite venue in Phoenix, if not the world. Prices are fantastic, staff is generally friendly, sound system is amazing. Most of all, whoever is in charge of booking has some of the best music taste on this planet. I love that they bring in acts that are experimental, weird and crazy, not to mention the many popular \"hipster\" acts. Security folks treat you decent and I don't feel like I'd ever have a problem with them.   Food is pretty good, not the best, but I'm more happy with their drink selection and price range. It's always a privilege to come here and I hope other venues take note."}
{"text":"I am so grateful this place has opened! I went to see Phantogram here a couple of weeks ago and had such a great time. As someone who often ventures to shows on her own, i felt safe here (walking in, and walking out), everyone i talked to was friendly, I even ran into some old friends and I always received prompt service both in the lounge and stage area. I loved the use of the \"bleachers\" to add seating you can see from. & the sound! Such a great sound system. I cannot wait to see more shows here!"}
{"text":"What's not to love! How can a place called the Crescent Ballroom not be an experience! It is not a place where little old ladies dodder around, looking for a handsome, dashing, debonair dance partner. It is also not a place for the faint of heart who wish to challenge the trivia gods on a Sunday night. It is primarily a music venue where local acts can hone their skills in front of an appreciative audience of just post adolescent audiophiles. If you do venture out on a Sunday evening to play trivia here, be prepared to be completely destroyed by the local experts. They really know their stuff.  There is some parking around back and I think you have to pay unless you are a gambler. The food choices are limited but they do have an eat-your-face-off plate of nachos that should satisfy anyone's hunger. The drink choices are quite acceptable if you can get the waiter to hear what you want. Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great venue! It's as if someone said to themselves \"perhaps we shouldn't do everything as cheap as humanly possible, they'll come anyway\". Instead, real thought went into basics like the vibe and general look and feel of the place, their relatively small but quite tasty and well-priced menu, their friendly staff, and even the layout of their main stage area.   Thoughtfulness basically permeates Crescent from top to bottom and it made a concert more fun than the normal sweaty, angry ragefest most shows tend to be, to the extent that a venue can control that.  Enjoyed myself and enjoyed that they really knew what they were doing up and down the line. As venues go, probably my favorite in the state now."}
{"text":"I remember when I was in high school and we'd go see live music at small venues like the Mason Jar and Electric Ballroom.  It was great to be intimate with my favorite musicians.  Those venues are long gone and I've seen many shows since then at large venues or small venues that just didn't have it right... Those small venues being bars or clubs that moved some tables or have a stage but a terrible sound system.  The Crescent Ballroom is everything I want from a small music venue. There is sufficient patio seating for the smokers to have their breaks.  There is also a large main bar area with seating for those dining.  This area is awesome and always open to everyone who just want to hang out downtown where delicious vodka and tasty nachos are served.   You can then enter the large space where the concerts are held.  There is plenty of standing room and plenty of stair seating (think high school gym bleachers).  There is a large bar in that area so you don't have to leave the music to get a drink.  I recommend finding a spot in the standing area in the middle.  Find those speakers and stand below them.  They have an amazing sound system where you hear and feel the music.   I hear they always have some musician playing either in the small or large area of the property.  It's great to have live music as an option every day of the week."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Mexican food and had to come here. I've been here once or twice so I was familiar with their fare. Sat outside in the sunshine of a cool fall day and ordered some chips and salsa and three tacos. The salsa here is split between a green and red. Both are fantastic for different reasons. Just when you think you've picked a fav of the two you taste the other and change your mind. So just eat both and get the best of both worlds. My only wish they were a bit more spicy. I like my salsa hot. But that's a personal preference. The tacos - one barbacoa, one pacific chicken and one carne asada. All three were amazing. Loaded with the various proteins and their own accompaniment. Just delicious. They aren't huge, nor are they small - basically, they are Goldilocks - just right. The servers were very friendly - specifically Michele, who had a constant smile. You gotta eat here if you get a chance. Great food, location and price."}
{"text":"My first time here I was like, \"hey this place is the bomb\" and all happy about my experience.  The 2nd time I went, it did not go as well.  It made me a little embarrassed I had talked the place up!  The front door staff seemed confused on how to charge our credit card.  A manager told my friends smoking on the patio before 9:30 was not allowed.  We left the patio and I watch 5 people smoke there and the guy said nothing to them.  When we came back to the patio, my husband reached over the side to grab his drink when we were obviously on our way BACK onto the patio and the same guy who was picking and choosing who got to smoke yelled at my husband for drinking off the patio.  It hadn't even been taken off the patio or drunk yet!  I'm not trashy, I'm not an idiot, and I don't like being nit picked every 2 seconds when I'm out.  If I have to follow the rules, everyone else should too.  Maybe I didn't wear enough hipster chic that night?  Beer selection is ok.  Food was ok.  Indoor venue gets 4 stars.  Parking is sometimes tricky.  All in all I'll probably be back.  I'll just expect less."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time just last Sunday to see Justin Nozuka and it was a very awesome experience! I went here alone and this place has such a welcoming atmosphere I felt zero awkwardness being there solo... They chips and salsa are pretty awesome salsa is actually spicy I had a few glasses of wine and some of their sangria. The sangria wasn't all that honestly but I can never find a place that serves sangria or wants to make me one (it isn't that hard!) so that was a plus and the venue has a really intimate feel to it I really enjoyed my show it was more than I expected and I wish more of my favorite performers would play here I am looking forward to coming back. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I want to say that I've never actually eaten here, but I've come for many many shows and this is probably my favorite venue to see live music at.   Upon entry, you walk through the main bar area where there are several tables for dining, and then you make your way into the actual concert hall. It's got a great ambience and of course, it's a smaller venue so any place you stand in that room is going to give you a great view. There are bleachers against the back wall should you want to hang back and just sit instead of gather by the stage. I've never had any issues with sound at this venue and they attract some great talent to play here regularly.   They always have something going on no matter what night you pick and just have an overall nice vibe at the place. If you want to catch a live show, I totally recommend this be a place you do it!"}
{"text":"Good concept, restaurant and music venue. The tacos came out fast, that was after we waited forever for our server to come around and take our order. They might have been understaffed. I would definitely go back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"All I can say is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that Phoenix finally has something to be proud of in it's downtown. I don't have to yearn for Portland, OR to experience great music, food and drink at a local venue, one that has great character, and a great location. The list if upcoming shows and bands is impressive. Major props to Charlie Levy for opening this great venue!"}
{"text":"So I came in at 845 ordered a margarita and 2 tacos at 915 I asked about my food the bartender who made my drink spoke to the waiter 5 mins later(mind you the people in big groups got there food quick )I was brought my food the male waiter asked if I needed anything silverware or salsa I dont eat salsaI asked for silver ware they where out  he apologized because I was by my self at the table I got no service from the waiters one female came beside me asked the next table if they needed a refill mind you my cup was empty and I also had a tab the saving grace was the kind female bartender who knew I got bad service she had spiky short black hair gave me a free house punch which was strong and she apologized for her co workers also the nice security guard put a red wrist band on me im not sure if it was because I was early but I didn't pay the reason I  rate 3 is because I was at the 90s night and the ballroom bartender who is a middle aged white male over looks certain ppl when making drinks I stepped up to the bar he helped the people in front of me and then he glanced at me and went to the end of the bar to help other ppl I dont know the rules I understand its busy but all I got was a shot which was quick but you rather make 5 mixed drinks also to end this long run on paragraphs my barbacos was super oily and had a lil drop of guac carne asada was over cooked taste like grill charcoal everything was seasoned ok chips where bomb the dj was fire was playing alot off good music"}
{"text":"Amazing little venue. Saw Neutral Milk Hotel here and it was one of the best shows I've ever been to! I love how there were water stations lit up around the whole stage. It's small but I kind of like that; it seems more personal that way."}
{"text":"-Perfect size -Great sound -Amazing burritos -Bar in lobby and inside venue -Always something going on IMHO best venue in the valley!"}
{"text":"Crescent is great! They always have great artists coming through the venue. I love going for trivia on Mondays or 90s hip hop nights! Always have great prices and a cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tinga chicken tacos were great Draft orange blossom close to blue moon beer Service was great Lauren was back checking on us every few Fantastic happy hours Will come back soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm literally sitting here. Like right now right now. Got here at 9:15pm. Bouncer let me know that I could sit at any table and get served. No one has visited. At all. It's extremely sad as I wanted to like this place, but over 30 minutes without service is a new record.  The guy next to me has been waiting even longer. 2 stars for the music and the nice bouncers. That's about it."}
{"text":"It is about damn time we get a sweet Indie music venue in Downtown PHX.  Even when they are just rolling with a DJ the music is always setting the mood.  I have yet to try their food but it looks to be a simple and tasty menu which includes pub favorites like burgers, nachos and burritos.    Crescent is consistently packed on weekends, they manage the crowds well for one exception, the front restroom.  Only one unisex bathroom is available up in the front lounge area and on a busy night you can be in line for a bit.    Now I don't have to put up with poor venue situations like The Clubhouse or Marquee to enjoy some of the artists that are making their way into PHX."}
{"text":"Best music venue I've found since I've been in AZ.  Solid cocktails and food too.  A nice spot with a positive vibe even if you're not there to see a show."}
{"text":"Place seemed legit but not friendly for out of towners. We waited in line for 45 minutes to find out they don't take out of state vertical identification cards... Lame"}
{"text":"There is an eclectic mix of musical concerts offered at the ballroom. Some we're interested in some not so much. For us the great staple is the Flamenco music and dance performance in the front room. Those guitars are reminiscent of Esteban when he used to play the Scottsdale Princess. The Southwest food is good, hearty even, and reasonably priced. The drink menu is well suited to the venue. It's a small place, often packed to the seams for performances, complaints about service have to be tempered. The servers do a good job, given the number of orders they get slammed with. We go with friends. It's the kind of place you where you want to share the experience."}
{"text":"Lots of raves about the entertainment and ambiance here.  No doubt all deserved.  But I have to give this place 1 star, and that excludes all that.    I went here one evening shortly before a show started.  I walked to the bar, with my wife in tow, and stood there....for about 10 minutes.   Other parties came and went, and the obviously busy bar-tenders attention swiveled between service calls and new arrivals, typically young women coming up to order...but they apparently never noticed us standing quietly directly in the center of the bar waiting to order.  Now this is a hard rule with me.  Ignore me, intentionally or not, fail to greet me and ask me if I want anything, within some reasonably decent time, and that place is forever off the 'go there' list.  We turned and left without a word, adding this otherwise interesting venue forever on the 'waste of time' list, along with a very small group of other places that fail to notice human beings standing four feet from them as if they weren't even there.  Trendy and 'cool' and 'hipster' do not begin to cover unconscionably rude and insulting, and pretentious comes more to mind under the circumstances.  If you are too busy to serve would be patrons, you're heading for trouble."}
{"text":"Very rude work staff.  They will ripe ypu off at every vhance theyvget.  They will also harrass you.  I had an issue with a wrist band and was treated very rudely.  You are better off not going to this dive, stay away!"}
{"text":"My first experience with the Crescent Ballroom was pretty sweet. A small group of us visited on a Saturday night on the restaurant side. From 6-8pm there is an amazing flamenco group. I highly recommend it.  Indoor seating is tight so come early. Food and drink are reasonably priced. The tacos are street style sized portions for $3 or $4 a piece. The carne asada can be enjoyed without adding any further spice. The blackened tilapia tasted like ... tilapia. (The non-flavored fish of the world.)  Beer runs anywhere from $3 to $5 on a normal day. Happy Hour is Monday 11AM-6PM and Tuesday-Friday from 3PM-6PM. Draft beers are a buck off.  I dinged a star for two reasons. Service was hard to come by for some reason. Perhaps they slow down service during a show to avoid distracting the performers? Or they would like folks to drink two beverages only? The other terrible situation is the number of bathrooms. On the restaurant side there is only a single occupant woman's bathroom. Unfortunately for us that night, there was barely any water running in the sink. (Which made for a long line.)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review on my background. I own a audio and lighting company in the valley. We do concerts and other events at venues around town and for corporate gigs.   Phoenix has needed a venue to the size and scope for WAY to long. I went and say Iron and Wine on december 2nd. The venue is what to be expected for a small room. The audio is great, the lighting is basic but meets the needs of a venue like this.  I like how they added the raised places to sit in the back, gives people somewhere to sit if they can get to the show early enough.   The bar staff was friendly, spoke with the Audio Engineer, great guy and all and all a great experience.   I will be frequenting Crescent a lot more. And Sean Watson is an amazing DJ. So there!"}
{"text":"Wow, I wish they had a spot like this in San Diego. We got a recommendation to come here from our server at Nobuo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix#hrid:R79IFDF-hekGT9WR5Z5LtA), which I highly recommend, by the way. We walked to Crescent Ballroom from the restaurant and it took us maybe 15 minutes. On a rather quiet block, it was the only lively place that was protruding sound. There were so many people inside and outside and in the ongoing concert room. People were out having a good, casual time with friends while a show was going on in the next room.   Although I have no idea who was playing that night, I had no interest in paying to see it. I just came to check out the scene and grab a drink. There's a lounge with a bar and an outdoor patio. I heard after the concert is over, usually a DJ comes out and spins but we didn't stay long enough for that. We sat down at a table in the lounge and probably stayed for about an hour. It was interesting to see how the Phoenix locals were, but it was awkward being there since mostly everyone else came with large groups of friends.   I guess now that I think of it, Crescent Ballroom could very well be like House of Blues in SD (http://www.yelp.com/biz/house-of-blues-san-diego#hrid:Wd0QJ16zgg70FsX0vHsQGQ/src:self), but Crescent Ballroom was just a smaller venue that does it way better. It's a cool place with a good layout that I wish we had here in SD."}
{"text":"I really like everything overall, but two things...the parking and how crowded it gets. But overall if it's a band your going to see, very nice for that."}
{"text":"I went here to catch up with a friend who just moved here from Seattle. We both really liked this place! I like that they have free music shows sometimes and the food is good (not the best food ever, but good). When we went, they had 5$ Sangria and it was really tasty. I got the carne asada burrito and I liked the flavor, but the meat pieces were a little too small and it was a little too beany BUT I enjoyed it. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly, and the food is always great (you gotta get the barbacoa burrito). I've lived in a few other states and I've been going to concerts since I was about 15. This is by far my favorite venue of all time."}
{"text":"Anyone claiming that Phoenix still has a 'lame music scene' needs to take the crack pipe out of their mouth. Whether you're coming in for a show or just for a night to chill at the lounge, this place kicks ass.   The staff is friendly, drinks are relatively cheap and strong (try the Honey Badger), and the sound is excellent. Heard Das Racist here a few nights ago and was impressed. Sean Watson spins here, too. The Scottsdale scene is dead and heading West, especially since the completion of the light rail. Venues like this are the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is exactly what Downtown Phoenix needed: 1) A great music venue that attracts an eclectic mix of local, regional and national acts; 2) An Indoor/outdoor lounge, perfect for happy hours, dates, or weekend revelry; and 3) Tasty and affordable food and spirits. I bring people who don't ordinarily hang out Downtown to Crescent and they're blown away by the \"cool factor.\" Charlie Levy did an amazing job creating the space and assembled a world-class staff.  If you're a first-timer make sure you try the Honey Badger (honey bourbon, ginger beer, lime, bitters), already the bar's star, and order a massive plate of nachos from the Cocina 10 kitchen. Crescent also has a nice selection of beers on tap that they rotate, including O'Dell IPA."}
{"text":"Love it! Great atmosphere and drink selection. Also, the menu looked amazing but we did not eat. What surprised me the most was how cheap the drinks were!!! Very reasonable. Also, the building is really cool and the atmosphere is really cool... it does not feel like the rest of Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Crescent actually has an amazing lineup of bands, but I went for a celebration with friends to hang out at the bar.  It was pretty jam packed because it was the DT Pub Crawl, but it was still a great time! Finally a bar in Downtown that I actually like! Exposed brick is a cool feel, and the DJ plays the best mix of music.  Drinks are reasonable (round for 3 people for around $15). ONLY con - one bathroom stall for men and women which gets insane when everyone at the concert leaves the stage."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is good.  There was a band playing but we didn't watch them.  We stayed in the lounge and had a late dinner.  Prices are good.  Five stars because they use Tilamook cheese.  My fave!!"}
{"text":"Good food? Check. Comfortable atmosphere? Check. Good music? Triple check. Crescent is where you have to go if you're downtown and looking for a place to relax a little. The prices are all reasonable, and they have a happy hour and daily specials as well if you're looking for extra savings.  I have yet to see a show here, but I've only heard good things about it from multiple people so I am very much looking forward to my first time. From what I've seen on their calendar, they offer a variety of high-quality free shows as well as cheap and moderately priced gigs. Trivia night 6-8 pm on Sundays is becoming a favorite tradition of mine. Just make sure you get there early enough if you want to sit inside (I'd say get there around 5 if you have more than three people)."}
{"text":"This is what a music venue should be. They do a great job of separating under-21s and 21+s. I'm not a huge drinker and would rather be closer to the artists, so I just went in the under-21 section in the front. The place is surprisingly well-ventilated (I never felt hot in the warm summer heat of AZ) and they provide self-service water and cups! My brother was even able to catch a basketball game near the bar while we were waiting for the opener to come on.  I wish I lived closer, but I'll look for shows here whenever I'm back at home visiting."}
{"text":"Crescent Ballroom is probably my favorite place to see a live band in the Phoenix area. You can get really close to your favorite performer/stage if you want. I have even MET a couple of \"rock stars\" hanging out having a smoke in the back parking lot. The sound is good. It's a clean venue. Small parking lot, so get there early for prime (paid $5) parking. It's a cozy venue, but not too small. It's the perfect size in my opinion, for reasons I already listed. So go support live music!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place should not be called a ballroom just because there is one disco ball inside. It is a more casual place, kind of hipster. I would change the name to something else because crescent ballroom sounds too glamorous for what it actually is."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you have a group of friends and you don't really know how to get the night started. There is literally something for everyone here. The food is really good, the drinks reliably consistent, the prices surprisingly low, and the music always on point.  You may just start here and end here. Make sure you dress comfy because it gets packed and hot fast (would give 5 stars if they installed a couple fans in the ceiling). Even though it's utterly hot, the eclectic mix of friendly people keep Crescent very cool."}
{"text":"The Crescent Ballroom is one of my newest favorite haunts Downtown. It's open late every night, they have a great beer selection, fantastic bands and the food is made by the owner at Gallo Blanco.   You can't beat the ambiance either! Exposed brick and wood covered walls makes it feel antique and vintage while still looking fresh and new. There's always a space cleared for dancing when the DJ is working and people are always willing to jump in and have some fun.  They also carry a couple of cider beers, which is great for the gluten-free beer drinkers. One caution, stay away from their famous honeybadger - because he definitely don't give a sh*t!"}
{"text":"Great concert venue ... smallish, bordering on intimate, but they draw in a lot of great bands.  The food's great too.  Pretty much typical Southwestern/bar fare.  Great nachos and burritos, and their Sonoran dog uses a Schreiner's dog and an awesome roll. Overall, if you haven't been here you should definitely stop in for a show or at least a good meal and some drinks!"}
{"text":"came here for dinner and a free show last Sunday. we unknowingly arrived in the middle of their trivia night. as far as trivia questions go - these were hard! I play bar trivia occasionally and I usually know at least a few answers. I don't think I knew a single question they asked here! and I thought it was weird that they ask ALL the questions and don't even tell you the answers until the very end. if I had been playing I would've gone crazy with frustration wanting to know what the correct answer was! it seems like the people participating were enjoying themselves though. I believe the prizes for winning trivia are a $25 gift certificate or two tickets to a show.  the food: nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. I ordered the quesadilla, to which I added steak. they shouldn't really call it \"steak\" because it was shredded beef. only other ingredient inside the quesadilla was a lot of cheese. it came with a side of chips and salsa and a huge scoop of sour cream. I might come here for food again, but it's nothing notably delicious.  the show: their stage/venue is really awesome with the seated bleachers in the back and standing room in the front. I love how intimate and small the stage is. we saw three local bands perform for free; they were all very different musically but I enjoyed them all. if a band I liked was playing I would definitely come back to catch them play!"}
{"text":"Favorite business model ever. I love this place. One of my favorite bars ever. Anywhere. In any reality or dimension I've been to."}
{"text":"Think hip Seattle/San Francisco local music venue circa 10-15 years ago.  That's really all you need to know (and to arrive during happy hour before things get crowded)."}
{"text":"I have been to this then-new-ish very dark venue a few times since '13 to support local bands or larger bands who have come to Phoenix.  I have never eaten here and I will just review the first 2 shows to begin with during my visits... I first came here in November 2013 when the 1st-generation Los Angeles band, X, came to town to perform their punk music hits they released since the 1970s, with fellow punkers, The Blasters, as their opening act.  The following year, I came back to watch the 3 local bands on one night: Cherie Cherie, Man Hands, and French Girls.  Every one of them all gave a solid true professional performance each.  I believe, again, the way a venue treats a band influences the bands' level of conducts when performing a gig.  The ticket prices were fair.  The shows started on time (thanks for not being too loud).  The staff was professional and organized.  Security was there (for 'X') but not that sorely needed (there was this one guy who kept trying to get people to move a bit out of the way, as if he's worried about fire exits- one attendee did get a bit mad at him for repeatedly touching him to move.  Putting down a rope like in a movie theater might've avoided this hassle).  I am impressed that everyone was well-behaved and got along(!)  This makes my evenings leaving me feeling pleasant and relaxed- which is why I go out, to have a nice time away from the everyday antics (wink).  The bleachers were a cool idea (my preference, too, instead of on the floor/pit for my safety's sake), and I stood on it to take great photos, as well as so I could see the performers more.  They usually leave tables / chairs for small acts, but for the larger ones, you only have the bleachers if you want to sit, and of course, if you sat down, it is very unlikely you would view the stage since attendees on the pit are standing (and dancing and cheering). I especially appreciate that upon entering the eatery/venue, that it smelled good- either food or 'sweet' like liqueur and not dirty or old.  A bonus is no smoking is permitted.  I do not drink either so I bring in my own water bottle.  I also appreciate that we're not being searched upon entry like the bigger venues- it's like visiting a club owned by a family or relative.  My paternal grandparents owned an Italian bar & restaurant, so it almost felt like the venue used to belong to them before they retired and sold to Crescent.  And, the fact that Crescent is located downtown and near the light rail stop is convenient for most. I still return when I get invited, and I hope I continue getting A+ treatment each time (wink again).  Maybe I'll even sample the food.  Thanks for the good times Crescent and band members (thanks for enabling me to take great photos and also for the sample CD(French Girls)).  See you again soon..."}
{"text":"I love it here!! Great place to catch indie, hipster, upcoming, and even popular acts. Sound system is great. Multiple bars. If it's a special event, they open the back patio up so you can catch multiple acts AND have a drink. There is always live music, any night you go in, guaranteed a band is playing.   Every bartender  I've encountered makes a mean drink and is super friendly, even if you're one of the annoying \"no close it out\" and return 20 minutes later for another round types. It's also pretty damn cheap for downtown. Tall cans of Stella are $5, $4 during happy hour. Most drinks are around $5-6.   They have trivia on Sunday nights, shit gets wild.   Oh and the food!! The menu was conceived by the evil geniuses at Gallo Blanco so you know this ish is good. Huge portions, tasty, and cheap!! I think everything is under $10! Basically, I love you Crescent."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Live music, food and drink specials, Sunday night trivia, and burritos with tiny little men on them!"}
{"text":"I like to go here occasionally because of the fun 2000s vs 90s events and concerts. I like the convenience of the restaurant portion of the place for grubbing after dancing. When I was out with my boyfriend and some friends, I had gone by myself to the restroom and on my way saw a pair of guys drunkenly verbally harassing any women walking by. The place was packed and as I walked passed them, one grabbed my butt. I turned around and grabbed the guy by the arm and confronted him about it. He laughed it off and denied it. I went into the restroom and tried to hold back tears from feeling so embarrassed and humiliated. I told my friends and they suggested that I tell the security there. I went to one of the guards that was just about to go do something and he immediately stopped what he was doing and asked me where he was. He got his manager and they proceeded to remove the guy from the premises. I had seen this security guard a few times before at Crescent, I think they have their own group of the same security. I appreciate him and the immediate action they took. I'm sure it prevented the harassment of several more women that night. Thank you Crescent."}
{"text":"Great spot for indie acts, and drinking with your friends.  While I haven't had the food, I've planned a pretend meal here. You know what I'm talking about? You read the menu, fantasizing about what you'll eat there when you go next time. Hey, if a menu can inspire that, I'm bout it.  Anywho - It's mostly the people here that keep me coming back. Fun crowd always."}
{"text":"Some brief thoughts after first visit to the Crescent Ball to see:  Trampled By Turtles and William Elliott Whitmore...  It was fantastic! very short walk to light rail station, great sized patio, short but comprehensive menu of tasty food and beverage selections, pleasant and attentive wait staff, nice entry way into the big hall area, ample stadium bleachers... in the back of the room, nice rise on the good sized stage (notice the number of comfortably spaced fellas up there), bar inside the main hall at far west side - nice and long - bartenders efficient and friendly, an established merch area/counter convienently located outside of the bathrooms - which is pretty nice sized where i only had to wait in queue once... it's like the guy who put this together actually knows what he is doing :-)"}
{"text":"They have great bands that play here , but its too small of a venue to hear music."}
{"text":"I love seeing shows here! Hands down it's the best places to see a band in Phoenix.   What's so great about Crescent? First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.  As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.  Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items. Last time we played we won a lucha libre action figure- score!"}
{"text":"Love the crescent! Great place for shows and the food and drinks are tasty. Definitely a five star place...except for the extremely rude and tactless employee we encountered tonight heading into the show. Beware of the grumpy man at the entrance into the show."}
{"text":"Christmas Trivia was a blast - thanks for the questions, burritos, fab cocktails, and prizes too. Service was excellent and though it was a small'ish place - very cozy and delightful. Thanks a bunch!"}
{"text":"I love this venue! Perfect size for low key shows. There's places to stand but also places to sit. I saw Quinn XCII here and had a blast!"}
{"text":"90s night was sooooo much fun! I haven't danced that much in years and it was fun to be around other ppl who love the music as much as me! A nice diverse crowd and a great time. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great place! I came with my friends for \"Dance yourself clean.\" So much fun! This is my new weekend go to spot for sure."}
{"text":"I follow a few rules in life to keep things simple. Go to the beach? Swim in the ocean. Ordering a beer? Choose something local. Walk into a half-decent mexican joint? Order the carnitas burrito.   Oh my god. This was the best carnitas burrito I've ever had. You'll feel like you should be wearing protection while you eat it. That good. Just go there and order it. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Their restaurant serves very good Mexican  street food. Not fancy but had their chicken enchiladas and another in the party their burrito. Both were very good and prices very fair. The restaurant sits in front of the ballroom so it's not big but they have outside seating which is nice. Also a bar serving drinks. Service was great too. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"A cool fun venue in Downtown Phoenix. Rock on!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place, I even was at the grand opening and have visited many times, but when I visited today there was this really bad bartender who was a fucking asswhole.  First of all he would  charge drinks to other customers really cheap but when I went over he would not let me order more than two drinks because it was \"state law.\" Keep in mind I wasn't even drunk.m, but when someone else ordered he would allow them to buy more than two drinks. I finally brought my friends to the bar and when it came to the bill, he charged me $9.00 for a shot.  This was ridiculous! I never had such bad service here until today.  I wish I had  the bartenders name but at least a picture would do."}
{"text":"I am here a lot for shows as part of work and we've tried Cocina twice now for burritos before the concerts. I heard they rock. The pork one is just ok. That's not my problem, though. My problem is the first time they forgot my friend's quesadilla. Then they forgot it again.  It was an hour before she got it, and we were all done with everything. They comped her but seriously, it's cheese and tortilla.  This week (Wednesday night) I gave Cocina another shot. Two of us this time. I ordered the pork no onions and it had onions. The waitress sent it back and then (after awhile) the cook brought out a chicken no onion. He immediately realized it was wrong again. By this time the opening band started and I had to get in there to cover the show. Finally the waitress brought me my burrito inside of Crescent an hour after I ordered. By now I had a few beers and wasn't hungry. It wasn't good either.   Kitty the waitress seems cool and claims it's not her fault. First time said it was the kitchen. Second time said there were new changes in the kitchen. I don't want  excuses, I want great service."}
