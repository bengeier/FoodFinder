{"text":"Chong Fat is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants of all time.  I live in California and travel to Asia extensively, but honestly I think this restaurant has the BEST authentic Chiu Chow food!! If you're in Calgary, you'll have to try this place. It's very authentic and has been open for over 20 years. 

I always order the signature items: Chiu Chow soy sauce braised duck, curry, and meat balls noodles soup. The duck with the sweet vinegar sauce is super good.. and the meatballs are all made in house. The braised beef brisket noodle soup is on point as well. Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the menu items. Oh and their housemade chili oil is very unique/ fragrant and delicious. Can't wait to come back the next time I visit family in Calgary!!"}

{"text":"Chinese version of that coffee shop in Seinfield. Basic no frills restaurant offering simple, good food.You can pop in here and have a filling and cheap meal and all the free tea you want. I like that each table has a set of condiments, such as hot chilli oil, so I can season my own dish.

Service is friendly and attentive, though not everyone speaks English. Fine with me, I can point! I like how my friends and I are never rushed out. Food comes out relatively fast. No credit card, cash only. 

I see a lot of customers ordering chow mein, chow fun, Singapore noodles etc., but I usually stick to 4 meatball soup with white flat noodles, no cilantro.  I really enjoyed the smoked duck - the meat was tender and so juicy. My buddy usually orders a beef flank curry dish with rice. The beef was very tender."}
{"text":"Had the duck lunch special - noodles in soup with a plate of duck and flash cooked lettuce (still has some crunch) and sauce. Cooked lettuce to a Caucasian seems funny but try it!  It's very good!  

I came in after the lunch hour and they accommodated my craving happily and quickly. Smoking hot soup, very tasty duck. I would have preferred if the skin was crispy but had soya sauce duck vs bbq duck as it was what was available   

I watched them cleaning in the kitchen while I ate. Another good sign. 

Not fancy but very good.  Fast, hot, tasty and affordable.  It will be a regular for me going forward."}
{"text":"Rarely open (lunch only, and not on weekends), but very good and very authentic. Not a fancy or comfortable place - you've got Calgary Court for that. Just damn good Chinese noodles"}
{"text":"We tried the three kinds of seafood with fat Noodle (which is udon) and the soya duck and soya chicken. We enjoyed all the dishes and we would try this place again. Some people had Noodle Soup with bbq meat. The portion was huge. This place is always busy when I walk by at lunch. It's a place for decent food, large potions at reasonable prices. I think they may be cash only."}
{"text":"If you're in Calgary, you have to stop by and eat a meal here. Also, if you don't order the meatball noodle soup and the soy sauce duck, you're taking a L in life."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure of a restaurant inside the indoor mall in Chinatown!   This is the indoor mall closest to Harry Hays Bldg.  My friend treated me to a lovely Beef Flank Rice Noodle Soup.  The soup was hearty and the beef was quite tender.  The rice noodles go well with the Beef soup.  She also ordered the Shrimp Paste Roll with a sweet plum sauce.  I just eat mine with chilli oil!  :o)  

This is a Chiu Chow restaurant.  I might come back and try different Chiu Chow items here.  

Cash only. 

Packed at lunchtime during the week."}
