{"text":"I went to the Food Truck Festival in Scottsdale today and tried many different trucks. This truck, by far, sticks out as my favorite. I had never had them before and tried a half of a quesadilla with Al Pastor on it- OMG it was so good! It was a good size serving and was loaded with toppings. The cheese was the perfect amount and right blend (Oaxaca, queso fresco and  jack). The meat was incredibly tender and there was so much on it. I can't wait to find them again and try more of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. I wish they'd stop circling so close to my work, because it takes a lot of restraint not to get it every week.  Both the Steak and Bleu and All Thai'd Up are amazing.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey given the portions, but it's absolutely worth it.  Plus, with one of their huge drinks (all the teas are phenomenal), I have never finished a meal and still felt hungry.  Plus if you return your mason jar, you get $1 off the next meal.  They can get thru a long line pretty quickly, but be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go in the middle of their slot. I find I usually beat the lunch rush right when they arrive.  Catch them at Urban Cookie for a great cupcake afterward!"}
{"text":"Luncha Libre catered my business event last evening (2/7). The food, the service, and the presentation was most excellent. My expectations were exceeded. This was a VIP event and PR was a premium for me. Luncha Libre was the hit of the evening and seemed to be a natural extension of who we represent ourselves to be.  The building management has some fairly strict policies for caterers; no problem for Lunch Libre. They are totally professional not only up front, but back behind the scenes where attention to details can make or break a deal. These people were on their \"A\" game the whole way.  I highly recommend Luncha Libre and we will be calling upon them again for all of our future catered events."}
{"text":"I love this food truck.  The chorizo they serve is amongst the best I've had.  I took my boyfriend to the truck - he was a skeptic about how good and amazing food can be from a truck - now he's a convert.  Treat yourself and eat anything they have on their menu... it's worth it.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable how good this was.  The All Thai'd Up was the best food truck item I have ever eaten, I do have a liking for sweet tasting flavors on meat and this was perfect!  They were part of our Desert Mountain ward's birthday celebration in North Scottsdale and they blew everyone away! Also should note all the staff working the vehicle were super kind and cool people."}
{"text":"Oh man.  I almost wish Luncha Libre was at a non-mobile location so I could visit anytime I wanted.  The luncharitas are refreshing, and I love that you can keep the mason jar afterwards.  I have dreams of the Papa Verde quesadilla.  Dreams.  The Luncha Libre Food Truck is worth visiting even on a 110+ degree day.  You can also follow their Facebook page for new food items!"}
{"text":"This is not your tyipcal quesadilla!   I had the privilege of first becoming a \"Lunchador\" at a charity event, and have searched out Luncha Libre on multiple occasions because I can not get enough of the Steak N Blue Quesadilla.  It is AMAZING! The All Thai'd Up quesadilla is fantastic as well.  Next up on my list is the \"El Diablo\" Burger.  I highly encourage everyone to keep an eye peeled for the Luncha Libre truck, or follow them on Twitter, where they post their locations every day."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Their papa verde quesadilla is amazing and so are their aguas frescas, which come in mason jars. To my delight, they recently added carne asada fries, which I have only ever seen in San Diego. The dish is very filling (a bit too much food for me!) and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Damn good quesadilla! The Papa Verde esta buenisimo. Fresh food made to order and tasty. Tried it at the Gilbert Farmers Market, now a fan and need to know there evry move. Try them!"}
{"text":"We hired Luncha Libre to cater a brunch for an day after wedding rehab get together last weekend.  They did a great job!  We had 90 guest (many from out of town) loved the food and concept.  Thank you Tim & Kim.."}
{"text":"Food Trucks are really hit or miss these days....  But this one...THIS, is a good food truck.  Every time they come around, I have to get something.  So far, everything on the menu has been amazing and I've even recruited some \"never-food trucks\"  people from my office to try it and they agree.  Good portions, quality ingredients, 110% flavor.  And the people on the truck are fun and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"I should've imagined that this place had good food by the huge line. Lucky they move very fast and I was able to order in no time. I had some tacos and a huge burrito which were amazing, hence the line. I'll definitely come back, hope they dont move to often."}
{"text":"I heard of this food truck stopping by my building  I decided to try it out.  I ordered the chicken one. Eww the chicken was these big chunks of old tasting chicken. It said marinated , it tasted straight out boiled.   For 10 dollars no way."}
{"text":"I hope the food is good because the service isn't. They don't seem like they were prepared for today. I have been waiting for 25 minutes. Really??The food was very good"}
{"text":"Their carne asada quesadilla is amazing! They are fairly priced, serve great food, large portions, and have impressive customer service even in very busy events. We go to the food truck events on Friday specifically for their food"}
{"text":"I always do my best to catch this truck on a day off. Get the all Thai'd Up, you wont regret it. Just make sure you get a beverage with it, it is SPICY!!! Steak and Blue is phenomenal, just make sure you are a blue cheese lover. Who knew dillas could be so bomb?!?"}
{"text":"Stopped by Urban Cookies today, and LL had their truck parked out front. Ordered the Steak and Shroom Quesadilla and it was A- Maz- Ing! The meat was tender and flavorful with the right amount of mushrooms and cheese, and the tortilla was just crispy enough. There was also a side of home made chips that were possibly the best chips I've ever had. The Pico de Gallo was pretty tasty, and the service was wonderful. I have had a smile on my face ever since lunch today! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food and Great Service. Keeley Phillips provided the best service I have ever had at an eatery!"}
{"text":"Mid sized taco good flavors. Bland flower chips... Good salsa.. 9.50...  I'm used to as good and more for less.  If price was 8 I would return.  Needed refried beans or something more for the price."}
{"text":"Found them on Twitter. Went to Quicken Loans yesterday and ordered the Steak and Blue. Delicious and large enough serving for leftovers. Definitely now in my rotation!"}
{"text":"So we were wondering around First Friday last night 2/7/2014, and our 8 year old decided he was starving.  Tucked in behind a couple of galleries was the Luncha Libre truck.  The menu looked enticing and we were not let down.  I had the Steak & Bleu Quesadilla and it was absolutely delicious. My husband had Alejandro The Great and it to was yummy.  Our son had a chicken and cheese that he devoured. The quesadillas all came with a side of homemade chips and salsa that were much better than most you would find in a resturant  We also tried the homemade drinks of a black iced tea, a peach iced tea and a lemonade.  All of the drinks were served in large Mason Jars with the lid on.  Talk about a totally unique food experience.  We thought the pricing was pretty fair for the portion size that we got. From the gentleman taking our order who was friendly and had a great sense of humor to the amazing chef inside.  We totally loved our experience and may have to start stalking this truck."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the steak and blue and it was huge. Super meaty and a great mix of flavors. Also had one of their yummy drinks. Can't wait to try their other choices. We will check them out again. Thanks for coming to our school event!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first tried this food truck while at Urban Cookies, and now .... we log on at least weekly to see where we can follow them to. Ya, it can be a little pricey, but soooo worth it. And the luncharitas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Kind of expensive. The drinks are fun and good. The food was good. Fresh salsa and chips and very flavorful quesadillas. Fairly quick service and very friendly."}
{"text":"Carne Asada with Pico, Jack & Bleu Cheese was SO GOOD! The chips and salsa were also excellent. Can't wait to have it again!!"}
{"text":"I have had the sheer luck of being able to enjoy Luncha Libra on many different occasions. I have to tell you their food and service is OUTSTANDING! I have been known to drive downtown from Anthem just to get these tasty morsels across my lips!  There is always a tasty variety of things to choose from, and the menu changes daily. Ohh, almost forgot...portion size is great! These guys will really spice things up for you too, just ask!  Long story short, try them!!! There is no way you will walk away disappointed!"}
{"text":"The hubster and I didn't get a chance to try this truck at the ill-fated Street Eats Food Truck Festival. Alas, we were destined to part of the crowd that went hungry, unsatisfied and without feeling in our legs after standing in a line for 3.5 hours only to get to try ONE truck. So thank the stars that aligned and brought us to a local event this past Sunday where Lunch Libre was parked and...behold...there wasn't a line a mile deep!   We immediately placed our order before our luck could change and managed to try their potato/chile quesadilla and their chicken torta sandwich. We are sooooo glad we got a second chance to try this food truck! Hubby and I were both super impressed with how fresh and flavorful the salsa and veggies tasted. They really added to the quesadilla and sandwich instead of being simple filler. After polishing off my entire quesadilla in a few giant bites, I told my husband that I could see myself craving this again...translation: we MUST begin stalking LL asap.  The bonus to this truck is how nice the owners are. They were super friendly and really made you feel like you were enjoying a home made meal. The pride in their food was obvious and contributed to our overall experience. We can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food truck. I've now gotten my family & co-workers hooked as well. I follow their schedule & any time they are within 10 miles, I'll go. My favorite is the carne asada but my co-workers all love the steak & bleu, all Thai'd up and the Papa Verde. That might even be the entire menu but I've yet to meet someone who didn't fall in love with (not just like) the place. Note: this comes with pico & guac bit I have them hold that."}
{"text":"I got the Chicken quesadilla. It came with A handful of tortilla chips. The quesadilla was a little smaller than I expected for the price ($9 or $10 I think I paid)...also I should have asked for more salsa. The salsa they give on the side was kind of small. The quesadilla was very tasty. Seemed like they use a lot of lime salt. Very tender chicken. Great flavor! Just could have eaten a bit more for the cost."}
{"text":"When is the last time you walked up to a complete stranger who was doing his daily job and had him voluntarily say during light conversation. \"It's so good to be a part of this team!\"   That was my experience just now as I pulled up to the Luncha Libre Truck to pick up some lunch.   I noted to this employee that they had some new quesadillas today and asked him to explain the new ones. We were talking about the good flavor and the great food available here. We then started talking about the awesome people who call this truck their job....ahh....otherwise known as home some days, I am sure!!  Yet another good experience at the Luncha Libre truck!  By the way.... What did I choose today??  I am SURE you want to know...  :-)  Today I had a Shrimp Bacon Quesadilla!  It was WONDERFUL!  They served it hot (not just warm....HOT!) It was very juicy, filled with a perfect amount of melted cheese. The shrimp were not those scrawny little ones....they were a nice medium size. There were plenty of shrimp in the sandwich. And of course there were homemade chips and salsa served on the side. Topped that off with a big mason jar of Mango Lemonade.  Lunch just doesn't get better!"}
{"text":"Great Food Truck Friday experience at Luncha Libre! I had the Steak and Bleu which came with a side of chips and homemade salsa. It was delicious! Definitely interested in trying other menu items..."}
{"text":"Yum! What drew me in far and away were the beautiful luncharitas in all of their tasty looking splendor! I couldn't stand watching everyone drinking them all around me and not try one of my own. They are as delicious a they look and you won't be disappointed. Their All Thai'd Up quesadilla is to die for! Anything with thai sweet chili sauce is OK by me! And their churros are delectable as well. I only gave them 4 stars for a couple of reasons. I wasn't particularly impressed with their Steak and Blue quesadilla, it seemed a bit bland when I had it. Their menu is pricey! 4 dollars for a drink is a lot. Yes I know you get a glass, but what if you don't want it. You should be able to walk back and get your dollar back that day, not a promise of a credit on your next one. Lastly the line can be absolutely atrocious. Now I know it's hard to hate because they are so popular, but it seems there might be a more efficient way to manage the line. Maybe a line just for luncharitas, so those wanting only drinks didn't have to wait in the full food line. Just an idea. All in all I love this place, love supporting local business, and eating yummy food! COME TO THE WEST VALLEY!"}
{"text":"It's not often I say this about any food.... but Luncha Libre blows me away every time. Everything I get is a new party in my mouth. Every bite is an explosion of bliss.  I know this sounds dramatic, like I'm going over the top here. Try it, I guarantee you will have the same experience. If you like it mild, it's great, but these guys turn up the heat with some of their salsas, so ask for it to burn! Luncha Libre is awesome, check them out!"}
{"text":"Awesome carne asada! Try the papa verde with steak! It's delicious and the portions are great!"}
{"text":"Luncha Libre and I started off with a rocky relationship. Every thursday my office has food trucks outside. Of course I went during their busiest hour (noon), but having to wait 30 minutes for a quesadilla seems a little insane. Once I received my food I was so very impressed. I had the papa verde with no protein. IT WAS AWESOME! I imagine if I were a vegetarian, this is as close to food heaven there is. The luncharita in the mason jar is just too cute (and delicious). I was also super impressed with the side of tortilla chips. Normally most places give you super bland, almost stale tortilla chips, but there's were perfectly salted and great with the pico. 12 bucks overall, and I get to keep a 32oz mason jar - I'd call this a win! Just speed up the service homies!"}
{"text":"The best.  Don't ever miss their truck when you get near it."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite food trucks, great food and friendly staff.. make sure you guys are wearing gloves.. I've seen some of their guys working and they are shoveling chips in my box with no gloves c'mon."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Luncha Libre, I love all of the wonderful, greasy, gluttonous goodness that comes out of your food truck! The food combinations are unique and delicious, with some items having a bit of a Latin/Asian fusion. The guys inside are usually incredibly busy but they're always friendly and fast. The salsa has a good kick to it and the chips are freshly made.   I am always happy when I see Luncha Libre around. And I'm always happier after I eat there."}
{"text":"They're friendly and their food is delicious. The All Tai'd Up quesadilla is stupid delicious and their chips are solid. They have a strawberry lemonade served in a mason jar that is also pretty tasty.  Overall, I highly recommend them. The drawback that I can see is that the Tai'd Up is so good and makes the other dishes less compelling to try."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I have had the black and blue quesadilla and the Mac n cheese quesadilla.  Soooo good!  And the mango lemonade is just as amazing. My coworkers and I will follow them all around town!  Can't wait I try next weeks specials!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this food truck!  I have been many times, the Arizona Cheesecake is one of my favorites and it a delicious spicy cheese steak sandwich.  I have also had the Vietnamese taco's which were amazing, the steak and bleu and the Thai'd up.  Everything is so good, it is hard to decide what I want anytime I go.  The drinks are super as well.  Fresh and tasty, so good on a hot summer day!  I recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something delicious, because you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I think this next phrase says it all..  I WOULD HAVE THEM CATER MY FUTURE WEDDING IF I COULD because they are THAT damn good!  SO delicious, mouth watering, anything on their menu quite frankly is like delicously undescribable. ( or however thats spellled)  SO recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"EDIT ok whats the deal here, you guys all afraid of food trucks for some reason? This was some of the best quesadillas I have ever had! You guys are seriously missing out if your cutting out food trucks ... Granted I dont go hunt them down, but Im always game to try em out when the opportunity presents itself!  This truck was brought in by our work. I had the \"all thai'd up\" along with the orange blossom luncharita. Both were phenomenal! Good big portion, a bit of spice to make you sniff, and some sweet honey to mellow it out. Definately would order again!!"}
{"text":"¡Fantástico!  ¡Excelente!  ¡Magnífico!  And other Spanish exclamation words I can find on Google Translate!  This was my husband and I's first time at the Taco & Dilla Parlor (13th Street and Northern), though we LUV their Luncha Libre truck!  The guy at the counter was a wonderful host in the small, clean and well decorated shop.  The food was AMAZEBALLS (as usual).  The All Thai'd Up my husband ordered was bursting with flavor (though he will order lite peppers next time)!  My special, a Shrimp + Chorizo Quesadilla, was thick and bursting with shrimp and gooey-cheese goodness!    I also indulged in one of the strawberry-rita aguas frescas - ¡Delicioso!   Oh yeah...we'll be back (and I will remember to return my big-ass mason jar)!  Go support the new shop, the truck and REAL GOOD FOOD in Phoenix! That is all..."}
{"text":"The quesadillas are so good. They are at my college campus on food truck day and it is definitely worth the money. The tigersblood drink is so delicious. I can't wait for my next Luncha Libre experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I eat here, the first time was surprisingly delicious, and this time, the food kept its momentum, it was also delicious.  I didn't get a chance to try the Papa+Verde, which seems to be very popular because after waiting in line for a long time, when I finally was able to put in my order, they had run out, so I went with the Alejandro The Great Quesadilla, which was Gyro beef, Kalamata Olives, Feta & melting cheese. Was really yummy, and also got the Mango/Peach I believe in the mason jar. The drink was pretty expensive at $4 each, but you get to keep the huge jar, and can bring it back next time for a $1 refill, not bad!!   Will be back to try the Papas-Verdes!!"}
{"text":"I started my love of food trucks with Luncha Libre. On a random visit to Urban Cookies I noticed there was a food truck that had a luchador painted on the side. Being Mexican, I was instantly curious. So I grabbed a quesadilla. I was in heaven. It was delicious. The salsa was perfect and the quesadilla was just the right size for lunch. I even grabbed one of their luncharitas. Also delicious. I'm lucky to live nearby a few of their stops so I try to stop whenever possible, although these days fewer times than I'd like thanks to my waistline. If my pants allowed it, I think I could eat at their truck everyday. I should confess, that quesadillas are one of my favorite foods, but even then, luncha libre's are the best. Their staff is always super friendly and they get you your food fairly quickly. My favorite is the their steak and blue but my husband swears by their hamburgers. Be warned, these might induce a nap/coma. They're big and delicious. You can follow them on facebook, twitter, and instagram to learn their stops for the day."}
{"text":"I ordered my food with out a tortilla and with out chips.  I asked for no potatoes and extra crispy bacon.  I received potatoes and nearly raw bacon.  I brought my bacon back and asked for it to be cooked more.  The guy working said he would just get me more bacon.  He ducked in the truck and came back and told me they were out of bacon.  He did not offer me anything else such as  carne asada or anything else.  I spent 9 bucks and still left hungry."}
{"text":"Yum! A girlfriend and I planned a lunch date for Tuesday. Not too sure where we were meeting, but I noticed she commented on Luncha Libre's facebook page that morning. They were set to be across the street from her office, so we decided that would be a perfect little lunch. She ordered the papaverde (potato and green chile) quesadilla and I had the grilled chicken - with the plan to share so we could try both.  We both inhaled our food so quickly we forgot the sharing plan! She said hers was fantastic, and I am enamored with the citrus marinated chicken. Portions were a bit smaller than I was expecting for the $8.50, but the quality is definitely there! I also ordered the honey vanilla iced tea (served in mason jar for $4.00, but with $1.00 off if I bring the jar back for refills) - it was subtle and delicious!  Definitely a nice add to the food truck scene - I look forward to trying more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"Good for the price, it was a little confusing trying to find the location.  Service was fast and food was nice and hot. Maybe will check me back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  These guys are a solid 5 stars!!  The truck was in Prescott @ The Mile High Beer Fest, my friend & I split the 'All Thai'd Up' quesadilla, it was amazing!  All white chicken, just the right amount of spice, delicious tortilla & cheese!!!   I'm now a follower!!"}
{"text":"My first time to this truck. I had the All Thai'd Up quesadilla and it was great. Flavorful, spicy and served up hot. I could have done without the nonsensical smartass comment from the order taker though. I asked if this item was popular and he sarcastically responded, well we are a food truck so... I enjoy sarcasm but if you want to be rude to a stranger have it make sense."}
{"text":"We hired Luncha Libre for a backyard rehearsal dinner with 97 people! It was an absolute blast. They were professional and informative from the start, seeing as I have never had to plan to feed that many people. It was great because our families and myself got to enjoy the party and not worry about serving hot food. Even better-there was no clean up! Our 60 out of town guests loved the idea, many had never had food truck food before. They also raved about the food. The service was great and the guys were making fresh food fast! I would do this over and over again! It was such a fun way to kick off the best weekend of our lives!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago my husband and daughters surprised me with a huge birthday bash at our home.. NOT an easy feat .. for one, our daughter's all attend college all over the country and just getting them home take a small act of Congress ... probably the wrong example considering. I pulled up to our home after the girls had somehow convinced me to run them to coffee and the mall. I noticed this big art deco blue vibrant truck in front of our home and said something like, 'these crazy new neighbors and their stuff' ...Suddenly I realized the crazy was all gathered in homes my courtyard! United Lunchadores Street Gourmet had been the choice primarily by my husband who loves their brick and mortar place, Taco and Dilla. He's raves about them time and time again! They were all set up with two different colorful house made drinks, tacos, and 'dillas' for our guests. They served for about 3-4 hours and my husband had paid for a certain amount and even with guests full of tacos and great quesadillas, there was leftovers to take home in time go containers. I personally loved  the Papas Verde Dilla the best ... it was a very filled quesadilla! Potatoes, cheeses and green chile peppers filled up the hand made folded tortilla and I could not finish it all. The All Thai'd Up Dilla was another favorite with citrus marinated grilled chicken , serrano peppers, jack cheese and an amazing thai sauce. The tacos were also so good and filling: Carne Asada ; Pollo Asada .. just so tasty. The salsas were fresh and excellent and the service from the two guys was exceptional! They brought me churros with candles on them to finish off a great night ! These churros were no average churros they were stuffed with cajeta and served with a raspberry dipping sauce. Again.. lots left over! No pressure to tip but we asked that they send around a jar anyway for the impeccable service and amazing tacos and 'dilla's '. I can't recommend United Lunchadores enough for all the greatness they provided on my surprise night and just know Taco and Dilla Parlor is open with a similar Mexican meets Asia menu that changes too if this cute food truck isn't in your area when you have a craving. Fiesta!"}
{"text":"Got a Thai'd Up quesadilla at the taco festival this weekend. It was getting late, but the food still came out HOT, insanely fast, and fresh. Friendly service. I went back for more. This is the best quesadilla I've ever had. I'm forever ruined. Please come to NW Glendale/Peoria!"}
{"text":"Ever just finish a meal and be full, but it was SO GOOD you just wanted to order another one, just because? This is how I feel about their Chicken Thai Quesadilla.......it was bliss. I saw them at the art walk in Gilbert and worth every penny of $9. They told me they would be back in 2 weeks, and I'll be there. Next time Im going to order it extra spicy!!!"}
{"text":"Luncha Libre food truck has a special place in my heart. They are one of the very first food trucks I have ever tried and boy did they set the bar high. I knew they would be good from the seemingly endless lines they always had at Phoenix Public Market Food Truck Fridays (unfortunately, they do not go there anymore), but little did I know how far they would blow me away. I love finding them on their less busy days such as their stop at Urban Cookies where they typically are for lunch on Thursdays (although not lately... please go back there, Luncha!). I'd like to say I've tried almost everything on their menu, at least the norms that they always have (thai'd up, steak & blue, papa verde) but boy their specials are phenomenal (namely Mac Daddy, Choke & Spin, Koreadilla, El Diablo burger). I am their self proclaimed number 1 fan. Their staff is always so friendly and grateful to anyone who comes out and finds them. They will customize anything to your liking. I usually ask for no serranos on my dillas because they are too spicy for me. But if you LOVE spicy, like you love your mouth burned, they have a super hot version of their homemade salsa. Follow them on Instagram to stay connected and find their stops! I am so proud that Arizona has been blessed with this truck! Viva los Luncha Libre!"}
{"text":"Luncha Libre definitely has interesting and unique versions of quesadillas. The cashier was very friendly and helpful regarding my allergy issues, notifying me that I could order gluten free options by substituting the flour quesadillas with corn tacos.  Now, let's talk about the food. I got the chicken quesadillas in taco form. The order came with three tacos on soft corn tortillas with lots of filling ingredients and chips+salsa. My friend got the Thai quesadilla, which he thought to be very spicy - I would recommend it only for people who are fans of spicy foods. The passion drink that I got was a bit too sweet for me, but my friend ordered the half lemonade and half unsweetened tea for a make-shift Arnold Palmer. Now that was good. All of the drinks come in a mason jar that people get to keep, and will get a $1 discount off of the next drink if they bring the jar back. Way to be green!  On the slight downside, $8+ for the cheapest quesadilla was a bit on the pricer side. However, considering that it was a food truck, which usually tends to run on the higher side for food, the investment was well worth it - I consider Luncha Libre to be one of the best food trucks that I have been to. I loved the clean, non-greasy taste that the tacos had - you know that something is made right when it tastes flavorful yet not overwhelming or greasy.  I might go back to try the blue cheese quesadilla (in taco form). Overall, very satisfied."}
{"text":"I tried this truck at the Food Truck Festival in January...and have being dreaming about them ever since!  I had the al pastor quesadilla and it was to die for.  This little quesadilla made a lasting impression.  I will be visiting their truck the next time they are in the east valley."}
{"text":"We had our first (and definitely not our last) experience with Luncha Libre at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest this past Thursday. Today is Sunday and we plan on going back to the Foodie Fest just to grab another meal from Luncha Libre.  Some people think a gluten allergy is a myth, a junk allergy. I've had this allergy for many years, possibly starting when I was a baby, and it wasn't until recently that people took this allergy seriously. The guys at Luncha Libre didn't treat me like I was a pain in the butt (even though this allergy can be a pain in the butt for any restaurant/food truck), and they made me feel completely comfortable eating their food.   They only offered two dishes at the fest, and the one I could eat was angus beef mixed with chorizo and jalepenos, drizzled in maple syrup and served with tortilla chips since I could not eat the Tres Leches bun. However, my husband could eat the bun, and he looked like he was in pure heaven eating that burger. I enjoyed their salsa as well. At first it wasn't spicy, but then it crept up on you and hit a mini punch.  I love good customer service and someone who doesn't make me feel like I'm a hassle, especially since I wish I wasn't one with my allergy. The next time they're at Foodie Fest or I am in AZ, I will definitely find them so I can try the other items on their scrumptious menu. Go here, get something that you can't get anywhere else right now. Salty, sweet and a little bit of spice makes your tastebuds sing, I promise! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I had a draft of this forever and I don't remember much but I just remember loving the food and I gave it 5 stars so it must be amazing."}
{"text":"Luncha Libre is one of a growing number of gourmet food trucks in the metro Phoenix area.  They will continue to serve our fair city because the food they sell is nothing short of sensational.    The menu selection has its always-available regular items, and a special or two is featured at almost every stop.  One of my favorites is not on the menu at all - The REY MYSTERIO.  This is a \"chef's choice\" dish done as a quesadilla which features \"a lot of meat and a lot of heat.\"  It's never the same way twice, something that keeps me coming back every few weeks.    One of the specials that I find every now and then is the Mac Daddy - featuring chorizo and truck-made mac and cheese.  I can honestly say that I've tried almost everything they've done (been following them almost since they started) and I've never hit a clunker.  The cooks and chefs know what they are doing.  They can be located through facebook and on their own website, which can be found through Google.  Give them a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering while I write this review.  Luncha Libre is so good, I almost feel bad for the other food trucks that come to the area by my work because they blow the competition and other trucks out of the water.   I had the steak and blue and after the first bite I thought I was in quesadilla heaven. The blue cheese with the zest of the steak was a perfect combination. And this was no rinky dinky quesadilla either. You will need to use 2 hands to hold it. A coworker has their artichoke and spinach one and she loved it as well. The mint tea they make is excellent and goes very nicely with the spiciness of the quesadilla. My only complaint is that I thought the chips were a little too salty and the salsa they give you isn't enough to put on the quesadilla and have with the chips.   Gosh I wish I had a quesadilla right now."}
{"text":"Have been following these guys for awhile now on Twitter getting ready for our upcoming, now over :( vacation to Phoenix. Lucky for us we were in town for the Scottsdale Art Festival and their usual Friday stop on 7th Street in Phoenix at Urban Cookies. The months of anticipation DID NOT disappoint upon our arrival at the truck. Along with myself, my wife and kids were AMAZED by the flavor and overall size of these Quesadillas!! We tried Steak and Blue and their weekly special which was the Carne Asada I do believe along with the chips and the Luncharitas in both Horchata and Mango Pineapple, all which made for a GREAT GREAT lunch! There was a line of people which was great to see for the LL Crew and a good majority brought back their Lucharita mason jars as you get $1.00 off on your next drink when you trade in you old jar for a new one, a great way to keep the people coming, and boy that they were, the line 12-15 people deep! And most importantly the staff...they are great!! Which makes it even better...we can't wait to see them again on our next trip. If your ever in OH-IO let us know :) Thanks again and thanks for remembering our Anniversary!!"}
{"text":"I love to help out the \"little guy\" in business.  I love these food trucks, gives people like me who don't want to leave the building to run somewhere for lunch.  This experience wasn't so great for myself and others from my company who ate off this truck this past Thursday, Aug 24th.  Everyone of us who got anything with chicken all got sick. First off the chicken wasn't as advertised (citrus marinated - tasted liked boiled chicken and very tough), the \"potatoe dilla with chicken\" was greasy and the salsa was very runny.  I don't like to give bad comments as it does hurt business, but it also helps the owners of the \"ULSG\" to correct cooking errors.  I will eat off the truck again but not for a while.  I know other's in the office who got the carne asada dilla's were just fine.  So check the chicken boys and see where this error was."}
{"text":"I had the egg potatoe and chorizo breakfast quesadilla, very well cooked crispy and delicious. Price seemed expensive for food truck but was worth the taste. If you're ever at the Gilbert farmers market on Saturdays, I would suggest you try it out.. if your really hungry! Good size portion."}
{"text":"First time trying today.  So happy I did.  Great food and glad I was first up at the Capital today."}
{"text":"Luncha Libre catered an event we attended last week. We had an exciting combo of tacos - from Thai Style, Steak/Gorgonzola to Bacon shrimp. All were amazing - we couldn't agree on a group favorite because they were all so unique and so darned good. Friendly staff, great food, and worth tracking down. Am looking for an excuse to have them cater an event at our place next!"}
{"text":"The toasty perfection of the tortilla is what sets Luncha Libre's 'dillas apart from the rest. I had the Carne Asada 'dilla and the tort was a little charred, a little sweet and was imparted with all the flavors from the grill.   I would buy a side order of grill toasted tortilla chips if it was an option. I also had the orange blossom tea and was given a large mason jar to keep and return for refills and a buck off my future visits. Now how good is that?!  Mondays: Lunch at Luhr's (Alley) - Downtown Phoenix"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to wander through the farmer's market in Gilbert on Saturday mornings - great food, great place to walk the dogs, and we love trying breakfast creations from the many food trucks that show up each Saturday.   On this particular Saturday, Luncha Libre was at the market - quesadillas for breakfast? Hmm, not so sure!    After reading the ingredients of a breakfast special, I asked, \"Is \"The Elvis\" any good?\"  What I got back was an overwhelming, \"YES, this rarely made special is amazing\".   Not often does a response take me back to my childhood, but his took me straight back to memories of my brothers telling me to take a bite of their latest culinary creation, like peanut butter and mayonnaise on a tortilla (don't try it)! Could I really trust him?    My first bite into \"The Elvis\" was an explosion of flavor that sent my taste buds screaming for another bite - not what I expected from a peanut butter,  banana, bacon, and sriracha quesadilla! I am not a fan of fried bananas, but the way they worked with all the other ingredients was fantastic! Everything in this quesadilla blended into a flavor that was unique and amazing.    I haven't seen the truck back at the market in a few weeks, but I keep watching for them.  And, the Elvis better be back on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love everything on the menu. So do my kids! We have had the Dilla's many times. Steak & Bleu is probably my favorite. My kids would walk miles just for the chips & salsa. We keep up on Facebook as to where they will be located. I am always thinking of some future party I might have where they can cater. That would be amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best food truck!  They even have a small building you can go to as well, in case the truck isn't in your area!  The steak is delicious and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying Luncha Libre today at the Coronado home tour. I admit I was skeptical. I mean, it's a quesadilla. Tortilla and stuff in it. Had it hundred of time after living in Houston all my life and now Phoenix. Well done Luncha Libre. Well done! The tortilla was perfectly crispy, everything was held together nicely. It wasn't that sloppy-everything-falls-out-in1-bite quesadilla. Flavors were great. I had the Marco Pollo (clever name) - which was a chicken quesadilla, pico de gallo, and hoisin sauce. Thus the clever Marco Polo pun of Asian fusion. I added a little sriracha and more cilantro in mine and it was perfection! The balance of spicy of sriracha and pico de gallo, the sweetness of the hoisin, and plentiful amount of chicken to entertain my taste buds. Simply great trucking food!"}
{"text":"Love at first bite! Papa Verde de mi corazon!  Translation: Green Potato (not dad, lol) of my heart!   I've been stalking this food truck for a while via their location texts (you can sign up for them on their website) & had yet to be close enough to give them a try.... UNTIL I went to the Science Center and BAM!! There they were, just waiting for me :D  When in doubt, I ask for recommendations. The guy taking my order told me his favorite quesadilla was the Papa Verde with chicken. So I said \"I'll take that!\". To tell you the truth, it looked like a common quesadilla in it's little box, but ohhhhh, sirree!!! It was anything but common! It was a burst of flavor with every bite & the potato and green chile sauce really made it awesome!   They had run out of Horchata, which I REALLY wanted to try, so I got the limeade. It was yummy! Fresh with just the right amount of sweet and tart. I also really like that it came in a mason jar :)"}
{"text":"I'm baffled that I've never written a review of my fave food truck and now 'dilla parlor! It was love at first bite. My first meal was Chef Tim's Chilaquiles. From the always flavorful meat to the truck made chips (seriously the best chips on the planet) to the amazing Cross Chop Charred Salsa (I buy it by the quart) the food is amazing. I have had nearly all the 'dillas and trust me, they are awesome. The best part of LL is Tim and Kim, the owners. They constantly go the extra mile to ensure their Lunchadors are happy. I'm so happy to see that the business is thriving."}
{"text":"Conveniently parked outside my place of employment, I decided to chose to eat at this food truck over the other three. My coworkers kept raving about the food and mason jar Rita mixes. I got the chicken quesadilla with the strawberry-mango. The quesadilla was loaded with chicken and nice and crispy on the outside. I wasn't a fan of the tortilla chips but the salsa was great. The drink was meh."}
{"text":"Wow.......the agua fresca, deliciosa and in a reusable mason jar!! The ox tongue taco...amazing! Make any taco or burrito vegetarian...they even substituted avocado in for me once time instead of chorizo. Portions are very large and spice is very nice! I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"This is the second food truck I've tried since the craze hit Phoenix and I still just don't get it.  Now, the food was great (I got the Pot Head[?] Quesadilla - cheese, potatoes, spinach, green hatch chilis but sans pico for me, and it came with chips and salsa) and the service was friendly but it was a bit overpriced ($8 for single tortilla folded in half and a small handful of chips) for the amount of food and ingredients (including a meat in it would have made it worth it, perhaps, but that was for another $1). I give them credit for the great tortilla and chips, obviously home made as it was fresh and moist, and including plenty of cheese - plus being able to pay with my card instead of relying on cash -, but I wouldn't try it again.  I was sad they didn't have the lemonade in mason jars they're supposedly famous for since this was at the Four Peaks 16th anniversary party - I asked and she said no because there's beer. I realise I was at an event for a brewery but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm drinking."}
{"text":"I hired the United Lunchadores Street Gourmet truck to cater my wife's surprise 50th birthday party at our home this past Saturday evening.  To summarize the experience and the food:   TOP NOTCH IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WAY.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  THANK YOU FOR HELPING MAKE MY WIFE'S 50th BIRTHDAY AWESOME!!!!!!!  I expected perfection from these guys because I have eaten at their brick & mortar location several times.  And they totally delivered on my expectations.      Their clean art-deco paintjob truck arrived about an hour and a half early to begin their prep.  The point person Jerren was professional, courteous and did a great job representing the business.  In fact, ALL of the guys were friendly and accommodating.   They set up in front of the house, put out a stand-up menu board and table on the sidewalk with a utensil station, and they provided napkins and dinnerware etc.  They provided their own electricity and literally made it so that I did not have to do any work to prepare.      As part of the catering arrangement, I preselected the Thai'd Up, Steak & Blu and Papa Verde 'dillas along with the Citrus Chicken tacos and Carnitas tacos as the entree items for the evening.  I also selected the churros as a desert and a couple of flavors of their handcrafted Agua Frescas (drinks).    On schedule, they began taking orders and promptly delivering food to our guests.  The feedback on the tacos and 'dillas was universally positive with the standout being the Steak & Blu 'dilla (see below description of each menu item along with guest feedback).  On top of everything, the guys put big \"5\" and \"0\" candles in a giant platter of their churros and delivered them into the house while everyone sang happy birthday to my wife!  This was really just an over the top great thing for them to do!  Everyone RAVED about the food.  The compliments I received proved I made the right decision by hiring United Lunchadores.  But the most important part was the feedback from my wife.  It was her surprise party, after all, and she was ecstatic!  She said that food really hit the spot and that she never would have thought of hiring a food truck for such a function.  Well, now we (and you) know, that this is a great way to go if you want to provide delicious food at a reasonable cost without all the associated work!     From the beginning of the booking process with Jony to the end of the evening when Jerren discreetly settled up with me so that I didn't have to deal with any of the \"business\" stuff in front of my guests, this was a smooth, easy (and delicious) process.  I cannot possibly recommend Gypsy Restaurant Group and United Lunchadores Street Gourmet enough.   Here are the menu items I preselected and paid for so that our guests only needed to tip on their own at time of service:   -Thai'd Up 'dillas with grilled chicken, serrano peppers, onions, sweet Thai Sauce and Jack cheese (my personal favorite) -Steak & Blu 'dillas with Carne Asada, pico de gallo, Blue + Jack cheeses (the fan favorite at our party) -Papa Verde 'dillas with potatoes, diced green chiles, pico de gallo and jack cheese (my wife's favorite at our party and a great vegetarian option) -Citrus Chicken tacos and Carnitas tacos both garnished with cilantro, onions and lime wedge (taco eaters got one of each and said they were both amazing and easy to handle because of their size) -Cajeta filled churros with berry dipping sauce (guests said these were the best churros they ever had) -Handcrafted Tiger's Blood and Mango Orange Agua Frescas (feedback was that these were delicious and many guests were bringing them into our home's bar and mixing them with tequila, flavored rum or vodka)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm quesadilla...........  Tried these guys at the ASU food truck block party. So delicious. I couldt decide between the deliciousness I got or another item, but since the girl taking my order (super nice) proclaimed that said deliciousness is her fave item they serve, I had to try it. Potatoes...in a quesadilla? She honestly couldve just told me that and I wouldve still been sold.  My friend, however, got the chefs secret special... holy god was it good. Totaly worth what he paid for it.  Cant wait til next Wed when I can try the chefs secret special for myself along w/ one of their Luncha-ritas!"}
{"text":"Everyone was talking about the Carne Assad Fries but they didn't even have them on the menu. Quesadilla was way overpriced and mediocre. I got the steak and blue cheese"}
{"text":"I love this food truck!! Super yummy quesadillas and the tea in the mason jar is my favorite. Very friendly owners and easy to work with. Highly recommend booking this truck to come to your next event or office lunchtime!!"}
{"text":"These guys were at Bone Haus Brewery last weekend, which was a perfect pairing!  I had the Thai'd Up, it was awesome and the guys were really friendly.  I hope to cross paths with this truck again soon!"}
{"text":"I came looking for Asada Fries and a food truck, but found a brick and mortar. I walked in to a very sterile looking environment, and was skeptical due to the environment but the Taco Dilla was the same place and also had good reviews so we took a chance. These will set you back $10.   Let me tell you, the serving was huge. I did feel like my fries were way too soggy, seemed like these could have been better if the fry to toppings ratio was better. I had maybe 4 crispy fries, and the rest were super soggy. Other than that, it was good - was just hard to enjoy the fries, which were freshly chopped. I thought it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Luncha Libre was one of the three food trucks available for good eats at the Adult's Night Out/Play Date at the Children's Museum.  I tried the Koreadilla ($9.50), a beef bulgolgi quesadilla with fresh jalapeno, shredded cabbage, and jack cheese.  It came with a side of salsa and chips.  The tortilla was nicely toasted.  The meat was nice and tender, and had a good amount of sauce covering it.  The sauce itself tasted too much of Hoisin sauce rather than Korean bulgolgi though, and the salsa, while cool and refreshing, was a bit bland and very mild to me.    It took about 10 minutes for the quesadilla to be made, and there was a steady stream of customers ordering.  As for drinks, they offer a selection of sodas and water ($1 for soda).  I'd like to try more Mexican creations from them again, but probably not the Korean style items (I've been spoiled by the awesome Korean/Mexican food at KoMex Restaurant in Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"Now I know I just wrote a review of L.L. last week, but we went to the P.P.M. last night and had L.L. again.    Update from 4 to now 5 stars.   Why?  Because of a few things which I'm going to list right now:  1 - Integrity. We brought our 2 mason jars back last night and were due to get a $1 off each  Luncharita.  We had asked, and the guy confirmed that it was $1 if you brought a jar back.  We sat the jars down on the table and thought nothing of it, thinking we'd get our discount.  Well I guess we didn't. When we ordered, he asked if I wanted a receipt, but I said it wasn't necessary.  The guy noticed the jars on the table when I went up to get our food and said..\"Wow, I completely forgot to give you your $2 off for the jars.\"  He handed J 2 $1.00 bills after he helped me walk our food to the table.       2 - Benevolence.  While we were up at the table deciding on our order, I noticed a flier on the table.  They're donating a portion of August's sales to the Hey Joe family (cant remember the husband/wife's names) to help out with their medical costs.  Hey Joe's wife was just diagnosed with cancer.     There truly is a great camaraderie among some of the food trucks owner/operators.      Our order last night - 2 Luncharitas, 1 Steak and Blue (super awesome), and 1 Papas con Chorizo (super awesome with great flavor/seasoning).    If you haven't tried Luncha Libre yet...you should be beaten.. with a tortilla."}
{"text":"They have been to our workplace a few times now, EXCELLENT service and food! I definitely recommend 'All Thai'd Up'"}
{"text":"Stood on line at Willo Street Fair. Dude stopped in the middle of taking my order to do other stuff, generally acted as if it was a pain to serve me, then didn't put my order in to the kitchen. When several people behind me got served, I asked for a refund. When I said they'd lost a customer with this nonsense, dude came back with \"Don't be so bitchy.\"  Guys, you had the option of giving me minimally adequate service. You chose not to. I have no social duty to pretend you were anything other than rude and inadequate from beginning to end.  Next time you don't want a customer to be \"bitchy,\" try taking their order and giving it to the kitchen. This is kind of a minimum requirement of being in food service."}
{"text":"The best food truck around! Amazingly delicious quesadillas; mouth-watering agua frescas; and by far some of the best salsa I've ever had. It's fire roasted and when paired with their freshly made chips, it's heaven.  Best part about this food truck? They're very active on social so if you give suggestions or feedback, they'll acknowledge you. They made horchata on request for me and gave me a free jar. They now know me and my coworkers by name.   Great service and even better food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Always quick and friendly what more could you want from a lunch place. Daily special is great but everything is fresh. Even the horchata."}
{"text":"This food truck was at my sons school spring festival and I was super excited to try their quesadillas, I've heard a lot of rave about them.   I ordered the chicken dilla and carne Asada dilla for a friend. I was kind of disappointed. My chicken dilla was very cheesy just like a quesadilla should be however it lacked A LOT of seasoning. Chicken was very bland. I had a bite of the Asada dilla and same thing the meat was missing flavor.   I was really hoping I would get my taste buds blown away, but that wasn't the case. I still want to try their thai quesadilla sounds very interesting when I do I will definitely update you guys.   Overall pretty pricey and lacked a lot of flavors."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Normally I'm not impressed by the prices of lunch truck food, even if I'm impressed by the food quality. I expected much the same from this place, when they came by to cater an event I was at - I forget home much it was for a quesadilla, but enough that I was like, yep, that's food truck price. Holy crap was I wrong. It was super amazingly delicious... also super giant. And came with a bunch of chips, that were also great, and dipping sauces for the chips that also were. Hopefully they'll come back next year for the event again!"}
{"text":"What a delicious way to start a Saturday morning!  I've been told by friends that I ever catch this food truck at the Gilbert Farmers Market that I need to get a breakfast quesadilla!  It was so amazing - we had the chirizo version and it was so good.  The mixture of cheese and queso was spicy tasty!  I'd highly recommend getting some breakfast next time you are out and about!"}
{"text":"Had the Steak and bleu Quesadilla today, absolutely phenomenal!!!!!!! Tortilla home made and fantastic, inside filling to die for! Chips and salsa delicious!!!!!!! SOOOOOO Glad I had this for lunch!!!!! Definitely eating their food again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am the self proclaimed queen of quesadillas and was super excited to try out this place this afternoon when we had our weekly food truck Wednesday at the office.   I must say, I am not disappointed. In fact, the papa verde is even better than I thought it would be! The staff was really sweet and when I got back to the office I realized mine had chicken in it (was supposed to be vegetarian) a co-worker bought it from me and I went back over the get it remade. They wouldn't even let me pay for the new one! So nice of them. If there is one thing I totally appreciate, it's great customer service....wellllll that AND great food. This place has the perfect combo of both."}
{"text":"When I saw this place pop-up on my handy dandy yelp app, I thought now that sounds like a MUST visit while in AZ. What a fun kitschy idea for a lunch place to be centered around the whole lucha libre theme plus the food had great reviews!   At first entrance we were a little disappointed to see the place was literally the size of my closet. It was 110 outside and they only had two small tables in the inside. We almost left because there was no way I was sitting at their teeny tiny table outside in the heat and the only other place for us to go would've been to the hotel room to eat - no fun there. Luckily, as we were deciding what to eat one of the inside tables became available.  We ordered a couple things including the Thai Quesadilla, a couple of carne asada tacos and the carne asada fries.  Well, the carne fries were definitely my favorites - loaded w very tasty meat and toppings. However, the Thai Quesadilla was a miss for me - the flavors were way too sweet and just not complementing each other well. I barely ate any of it. My friend loved her tacos and thought they were very good so perhaps I just should've ordered a more traditional type quesadilla.   All in all it was good and i'd give 'em another shot but make sure you have somewhere to take your food back to with AC or go in the fall/winter if you want to sit outside. ;)"}
{"text":"I have never been more impressed with a food truck. Fantastic! A lot of food trucks have great food but these guys are amazing. I get the 'All thai'd up' and love it. Spicy, sweet, just the right mix of everything.  You also can't go wrong with Horchata. Even the chips are awesome. Quite possibly the perfect lunch. I get mine with corn tortillas instead of flour but I've had it both ways and they are equally delicious. ¡Es comida muy buena!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh   Yeeeeeahhhhh!  Now we are talking!!   For me when I am hungry and unsure what to eat at home I turn to making a trusty quesadilla.  Warm, crispy, cheesy goodness that satisfies my hunger.    But there are times I do crave something more and Luncha Libre does that for me.  It fills a need, comforts me in a moment of indecision and feeds my hunger.  Crispy tortillas filled with a variety of creative flavor combinations of meats, cheese and veggies.  [I have also seen hamburgers on their menu but I have yet to try them.]     My favorite go to is their Papa y Verde.  Warm [Hot] nicely fried potatoes with cheese and green chile.  Comfort food goodness.    They also have these amazing drinks in various flavors.  Some are like the traditional Agua Fresca you would find at a Mexican restaurant and others more sophisticated like mint green tea.    The coolest part (depending on how you look at it) is they are served in a cool reusable multi-purpose class canning jar.  I use them when they get home but for some carrying around a jar around 1st Friday after you have finished your drink can be a bit of a 'burden' .  They are a great balance of  simple complexity and complex simplicity.  Luncha does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Tasty food. I had the Papa Verde - it was flavorful and filling. Plate sizes are perfect and not too big. I had the plain old iced tea luncharita and it was amazing - can't quite place why but I would definitely get it again despite the price. I think the tea to ice ratio was perfect and it was ice COLD. Something most restaurants cannot do correctly.  Chips that are included are very tasty but heavy so I only consumed a few.   Bonus that they park at The Elementary School here and a portion of the proceeds goes back to the school. Recommend! See you at the truck"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome and delicious... Deliciously awesome  if you're hungry than ya gotta try one of each. Their Jamaica tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"[Sigh]  I had to share my meal.   I'm an idiot.  (But if you know me you already knew that. But seriously -  Never give up the FORK POWER!)  Luncha Libra was at the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan. I'm going to keep an ear to the ground to see where these kids are around town. GOOD STUFF!  All Thai'D Up\" (Ha!) Consisted of citrus marinated chicken, serranos, onions (no one needs to kiss me, food is involved! carry on), jack cheese and sweet thai chile sauce. When there's a feeding frenzy going on it isn't pretty. (Hey, the FOOD WAS GOOD!)  When asked if \"regular\" was ok we nodded. \"Eh?\" Turns out that \"spicy\" really would have been a kick in the pants. And this is from the kid who grew up sucking on Taco Bell extra hot packets. And the adult who has an established relationship with Sriracha.  (Listen, I have a very myopic view on life: Food/booze, the gym, fashion and beauty products. Women understand. Spice goes well with food. These guys totally have the hot market cornered!)  Biting into the Quesadilla was a delightful mix of textures and flavors. The tortilla was thicker than I expected and had a slight crunch to the outside. (None of the expected goopy mushiness that can happen with so many other quesadillas.) The chicken had been grilled and I can't do justice to describe how wonderful the taste was. Which really just means YOU SHOULD EAT THIS.   Yeah, pretty much. I'm sitting here trying to articulate how great my eating experience was. Words fail right now. I should have whipped out my Yelp pen. But NO. I was too busy STUFFING MY FACE. Yeah. That.  Oh! Drinks are really good. They have some fancy sounding drinks (which I can't find on their menu) that come in a mason jar. The Guava something - Hoh My. YUM!  High Five for This Food Truck!"}
{"text":"We drive all over the city for their AWESOME quesadillas! Simply the best around!   very unique and flat out delicious! Must give a try if it's in your area. Also, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The Papa Verde was delish and the service was fast and friendly. The quesadilla was enough food to fill my gullet.  I got the Mason jar juice in the past and it was awesome. Yeah a tad more than I would pay for a quesadilla but please just try it and you'll see why. Awesome fresh flavors."}
{"text":"By far my favorite food from any food truck.  Truly delicious and quality food. I crave it on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I had the Thai chicken quesadilla for lunch.  It was everything I expected and more!  Delicious crispy tortilla on the outside and warm melty cheese with plenty of chicken and onions inside.  The only thing I didn't like that much was that the Thai sauce was a little too sweet.  I really loved the salsa they served on the side, and the chips were great too although a tad too thick for my liking.  I am full and happy now."}
{"text":"Ok, I finally got food from Luncha Libre and it was phenemonal, one of the best hamburgers I've had in my life! It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, great quality of meat, fantastic toppings, and it was a great size.  The Luncharitas are one of my favorite things on earth and if I could only drink 1 thing for the rest of my life those would be what I choose."}
{"text":"Lunche Libre ! You now found a new stalker ! I was fortunate enough to live near two schools they stopped off at the past two weeks. Both times I had the Steak and Blue quesadilla. The Carne Asada was delicious and the combination of everything in it was perfect. I've had the Aqua Frescas in the past and they are a must."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their steak anything is amazing and filled with flavor. Don't come here if you're trying to be healthy. Clearly the food here is made with love."}
{"text":"First, I must tell you I am always weary of quesadillas because I can't see what is in them! I ordered the Thai dilla and could eat this with my eyes closed as it was just that good. The chicken was high quality and the sweet Thai sauce paired with jalapeños was to die for! I dipped my chips in the sauce that spilled out, it was that good. This food truck cares about their food and you can tell in how they make it. My coworker had the steak and blue cheese and was raving about her meal too. We have about three food trucks that come to our work each week and this has been the best one yet. I think I run the risk of being a Luncharados groupie and following this food truck on the road! If you see this truck, grab your wallet, run and get in line!"}
