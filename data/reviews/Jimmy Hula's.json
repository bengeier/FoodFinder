{"text":"I love this place. Any time we are anywhere nearby we make a trip here. The tacos are just the best and the people who work here are the coolest. Super fun vibe and great prices."}
{"text":"Love this place! Didn't know what to expect, we were on our way back from a hike on South Mountain looking for a good burger and beer.  This place delivered! Great vibe, food was delicious, service top-notch!  Highly recommend if you're looking for a casual, laid back beach feel with great flavors!"}
{"text":"It really is Food Nirvana!  We tried Jimmy Hula's on impulse with two adults and four children.  I had a great spicy burger.  The bun was toasted and buttery, and the fuego sauce was amazing!  Kids had chicken tender meals, and one said it was \"food heaven!\"  My husband had the chicken teriyaki bowl, and he said it was very filling, but wished it had more sauce.  

The value was good and the atmosphere was fun - kind of whimsical surfer style.  The kids liked the reclining airplane style seats.  

We will be back if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"So I'm from the islands, not many places in the valley have good island food. So I checked out Jimmy Hula's and they have a breakfast sandwich called Moco Loco, it has gravy and egg in it. Kinda close to my favorite local dish from the islands, Loco Moco (rice, hamburger patties, gravy, eggs). So I went for lunch today and asked the waiter if he could make me and a co-worker real Loco Moco plate since they had the ingredients, and boy did he DELIVER! It was AMAZING! I begged for them to get this on the menu!

I'm sending everyone I know to Jimmy Hula's to order a Loco Moco plate!

UPDATE: so apparently my review and recommendations for the Loco Moco has caused some 'issues' with the Management. So sorry! Not my intention! Anyone reading this must realize the Loco Moco is an OFF MENU item. My man Dez totally hooked a local brotha up by making this amazing dish, and I am forever grateful, but if you show up asking for the Loco Moco, don't be upset if they cannot make it. Hopefully they can get it on menu soon, as this was easily the BEST Loco Moco in the valley (even better than many island places! ), But I guess that's a corporate decision, or whateva. Anyway, MAHALO brah's!

PS - Every single person I've sent there to try the Loco Moco has LOVED it! Every one. And they're all haole! Think about it, you guys could make this HUGE! \"Best Loco Moco in the Valley!\" LOL!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty when we arrived but I was happy with the friendly hostess. They have a very unique beer selection. I had a longboard from Koba brewing followed by the pineapple wheat by SAN TAN. I ordered the Aloha burger with Cajun fries the fries are excellent. The burger bun is nice and  soft. The burger is nice and juicy. The pineapple mixed with the onion provides a sweet and tasty burger. I suggest giving the place a try if you are looking for a good burger in a nice little piece of Hawaii."}
{"text":"The jimi chimichurry was DELISHHHH!! I will definitely be returning for more! Loved the atmosphere and vibe of the bright colors and COMFORTABLE seats :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Jimmy Hula's several times and I really love the atmosphere and food. Their Hawaiian theme is all about beaches, surfing, and kickin' back - which is what I dig about Hawaii. Love the teriyaki tacos and burgers -yum! A nice casual place with great food and excellent, friendly service. The upholstered high-back seats are so comfy!"}
{"text":"I went here the first time to discover it closed for repairs.  I visited it later and it wasn't too busy.  Service is good.  Thought it was fast food but it's sit-down.  Wasn't a fan of the fries but the burger was ok."}
{"text":"Really awesome burgers with a different twist will definitely be back I had the Juan Jovi burger which had the most tender juicy pork I have ever had definitely recommend as well as the diablo burger. Staff is friendly and food came out quick!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm from the northwest valley and there are not a lot of places like this on my side of town. Extremely laid back and casual. The variety of fish tacos and turf tacos  really has something for everyone. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the fish and shrimp tacos and the zucchini fries are awesome. Also, you can't beat the price. Highly recommend this place, we will be back."}
{"text":"Omg their voodoo taco is sooooo good !!

And their habanero burger is super spicy !
5 s all day .
(Made a yelp account JUST for them)"}
{"text":"Tacos are legit,  brews are cold and it's good vibes. Service is great.  Get down here and have some fun. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I passed by this place many times and was really unclear on what they were selling so I never went in. From the outside, it looks like a Hawaiian surf gift shop. On the side of the building is painted \"food nirvana\" in which I always thought to my self while driving; \"what the hell does that mean? Do they serve Hawaiian? Mexican? Asian?\".
Well fear not folks, went in today and was pleasantly surprised. Inside decor was of a Hawaiian gift shop, mixed with some 70's novelty burger shop seatings. They had cool car chairs that reclined which I never encountered before (except in cars). 
 It was a bit on the pricy side and it did look like they had new people on board. We had 3 people with us and it came about to $35. 
It is not Hawaiian by any means but it's more Mexican-american oriented with California surfer terminology strewn across their menus. My burger was fantastic, their fries are really not great though. It's not crispy by any means and it feels soggy but it was fresh. I'm not sure how they achieved such mediocrity in their fries. 
 I do recommend the burger though, it is served on rye bread so the bread got soggy fast; but the meat had a lot of merit to it.  Also had a bite of the California taco and that was also great. Waitress was attentive, recommended me some food to eat, which I appreciated. Will come here again to experience other foods, I'll probably try the other burgers next time."}
{"text":"Longest wait for a 2 taco combo. I know they're new but a little faster service would be tighter. The tacos in the end were pretty good, not street taco good but decent to sustain my crave for it. The place is quaint and plays some really good music overall, also the staff are pretty nice."}
{"text":"I have tried really hard to give this place my business, but have been unsuccessful.  A few weeks back, on my way to work, I saw the staff standing on the street holding out small brown bags of breakfast.  On the third day of them doing this I finally stopped, took a bag, and was happy with the little breakfast pocket that was inside.  I thought it was a smart way for them to try to drum up business!  

Unfortunately I have been unable to get breakfast from them since.  I have tried FOUR different times!

I first stopped on a weekday, on my way to work at nearly the same time they had been out there holding out those little bags (8:30am).  The place was closed.

The second attempt was on a Sunday morning, maybe 10ish.  Again, the place was closed.  

The third time I stopped was a Saturday morning, about 8ish, and they were closed.

I mean, who the hell serves breakfast but isn't open at breakfast times?

This morning (Saturday) I tried AGAIN but went later hoping they'd be open.  I got there at 10:48am.  They were open!  But they were no longer serving breakfast.  This one really angered me because the drive-though menu says it's available from 6am-11am (laughable considering they are not actually open in the mornings).

I'm done trying.  I've only even tried this hard because they are in my neighborhood and I want them to survive.  But I'm done. It should not be this difficult to give them my money."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Was greeted and offered a drink. And then 10 minutes and saw no one!  There were only 5 people in the whole place at 6:30 pm. The tacos were actually pretty good!

The person that I assume is the manager, who greeted us and took our drink orders when I first arrived, and then wasn't seen for the rest of our time there until just before we left. He left a waitress to service both the dining area as well as the drive up window most of the time we were there. He must've seen my initial version of a Yelp review, as he came directly to our table and asked if everything was OK and if we had any issues. He didn't seem to want to take no for an answer to the question. He eventually comped our meal, which was very generous, but too little too late. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

I appreciate his interest in trying to make it right, but I left $20 on the table to cover The cost of our two meals. I have bumped up the review to two stars based on his attempt to make things right. However, the service was still poor the majority of the time. Therefore I stand by my initial review.

Next time I'll keep driving and spend my money elsewhere. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a suprise! Read good reviews, but when we pulled up- it had a drive through- not what I was expecting. These were the best fish taco's we had in AZ- (they are HUGE) and they come with fries which is weird, but very American. The teens had burgers and loved them. We did have to ask them to change the music as they had some very offensive rap music on and there were kids in there- but the waitress was happy to do so."}
{"text":"I'll be back! This place is the bees  bomb! 
I can't pick a favorite- it was ALL amazing  
We had the crack'd corn , fire  roasted avocado , Juan jovi  burger, wipeout , and the Johnny Utah ! 
The sides  and coleslaw were both on point too! And I'm picky about coleslaw 
You won't regret coming in to try this spot out! They've got great food, good music , and a fun atmosphere too! 
P.S. The rum Rita was a delightful treat too! 
(Sorry I was so excited to try it I didn't take any picks!)..... next time!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible wait. Did I mention the wait time to get your food was horrific? I'm talking about nearly 30 minutes for fast food. At that point any value in price has been erased. The food would have to be hand fed to you by bikini women fanning you with palm leaves. And seeing as how those were in short supply the food is only getting rated as mediocre. The owner was there during my visit and appeared to be part of the problem. Under staffed. Poorly trained. Kitchen manager guy was cool but after a 30 minute wait for some chicken and rice.... there was no saving this visit. I thought initially that I would give them another shot but after 2 weeks of thinking it over I have to vote no. Stay away unless you're just bored and have nothing better to do. Oh and after 25 minutes of wait..... THE ORDER WAS WRONG!"}
{"text":"Not very good.  The food is average at best.   Poor location and I wonder if they will make it.  The service was OK and friendly, but the food is just not very good and it is over priced."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST ON POINT! Stopped by on my way to work because they were offering free breakfast sandwiches. I'm so glad I did! The sandwich was amazing! Super impressed and surprised to be honest. It was like an \"uncrustable\" style sandwich with eggs and cheese. Fluffy eggs, perfect seasoning and so cheesy! This is my new breakfast spot on my way to work - for sure! Can't wait to try the tots and rosemary sausage! 10/10 would go again. Most likely tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Slow service. Dropped in for two tacos and have been waiting for over 30 minutes since i gave my order. New place, so i hope they streamline their systems to be more efficient on getting people in and out or load up those that want to hang out."}
{"text":"So, I tried Jimmy's again. After ordering at the drive thru, I waited 8 minutes behind a car in front of me, and then another 8 minutes for my food once that car was gone. I ordered cracked corn, with extra cilantro, a malibu taco, blackened fish, no lettuce, and a standard taco with steak no lettuce. The corn had very little cilantro and was smothered in chili powder to the point I had to scrape it off to eat the corn. The fish in the malibu taco seemed like it was overcooked, or something as it was like mush.....gross!  The standard taco had half as much steak as the last time I got one. Inconsistency, and mediocre to bad food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm am a Californian. And I eat great burgers in L.A. However this place has one of the best burgers I have tasted. Plus pitchers are only $5! What!!! Furthermore I met Scott the owner, and he's a down to earth funny dude. That likes to golf. Lol."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant during spring break and we were so happy with it!! I had the voodoo and wipeout tacos and they were both delicious!!! The wipeout was my favorite. They have fresh delicious ingredients and amazing sauces! Do yourself a favor and come eat dinner here!!!!"}
{"text":"Just an amazing process over here at Jimmy Hula's. The air is just a little bit smoother, and the beer is just a little bit better. I'll be parked here 8 days a week"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and will absolutely be coming back. Best tacos in town, for sure. The variety and creativity of menu items makes this place stand out more than any taco/burger shop. I got the tacos with steak and shrimp. My buddy got tacos with pulled pork, barbecue sauce, mac & cheese, and other ingredients. We were both thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"I had seen this place for a while and wanted to try it out, so tonight I did. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good either.

The biggest complaint I have is that the food was WAY too salty. To the point that I could barely taste the other ingredients. I had the Santa Barbara burger with fries, but it was hard to discern the avocado or sauce over the salt. Also, the fries were pretty limp and not that hot. 

This place could be good if they can iron out these issues. You can't have a good burger place if your fries aren't crisp. You just can't. Cut back on the salt too, and maybe I'll be back. Until then, sorry, but I'll stick with In N Out."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and drink al the servers are super personable and the owner is as friendly as can be. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing, we loved it. Fast service and omg the queso is so good! Can't go wrong with the Johnny Utah with pickles, pulled pork, and mac and cheese in a taco. That's right a taco! Great laid back spot to eat and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this amazing place! I went there on a Saturday around 5ish and right as I got in the parking lot, it was empty. They were open, and I was already skeptical about the place because of how empty it was. I proceeded to walk in and we were seated and welcomed. The restaurant has a cool look to it, plus the music they have playing was awesome. Anyways, they have a wide variety of food to choose from. We chose the Crack'd Corn as an appetizer and it was very tasty! As I had mentioned, there are so many things to choose from it was hard on what I wanted to order, so I ended up ordering a Buffalo Chicken Caesar Taco and a Burnt Reynolds Hamburger. So glad I ordered those two!Both of them have decent prices and give you a great portion! I can't wait to go back again and try the rest of their menu! I wish them much success and hope that their business grows!!!"}
{"text":"Nachos were bomb, had a shrimp and steak taco was very good! Burger was big and very well priced and most importantly beer was cold!"}
{"text":"So having eaten here 4 times now I feel I can accurately review Jimmy Hula's as a whole.  
To begin with the food is amazing (sans one incident that was corrected by the amazing owner).  Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had and growing up in southern California that is saying something.  The pineapple mango salsa is to die for and I now always order an extra side of it.   The sweet potato fries and zucchini fries are perfectly crispy and the dipping sauces take it to a whole new level.  The only negative I do have is about the service and not from the wait staff but from the kitchen; it is slow and frequently they mix up orders.  Most recently my husband and I both ordered 2 tacos and one of my tacos was on his plate but not the end of the world as we just switched them.  
If you are in a hurry I wouldn't stop in but if you have some time to sit, relax, and enjoy the ambiance this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went a month or so ago, ordered the BBQ pork taco with Mac and cheese on it. Left to go pick up order, received a call from an unfamiliar number didn't answer. Got to the store and was told they didn't have Mac and cheese at 1:45 PM!!! Ok so I was offered a substitute a very salty regular pork taco. It was not good....on top of not what I wanted. The fish taco wasn't crispy and it just ran together with the mango,pineapple salsa. The lady at the counter was pleasant, her co worker kept trying to get me to get a beer. I was fine with the complimentary soda.The other thing was this CREEPY looking black dude, who was just staring at me. I'm a black dude.....by the way. And dude still creeped me out....the menu is all over the place I must agree. Depending on the time you go , you have to fight the traffic on Broadway to get the wrong food and recklessly eyeballed by a weirdo. Not sure if I'm going back"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with some friends who were raving about it. This place sure lived up to the hype from my friends. I had the JimmyChurri tacos and they were great..the fries that came with the tacos were nicely done as well.  I Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Incredible Tacos and great drinks. Get the johnny Utah with BBQ and macn cheese! Sit on the patio and enjoy the music.

Truly a diamond in the rough.

I could hang out here all day. 

The staff is really laid back and really know what they are doing"}
{"text":"Oh my lanta!!! This place is glorious delicious scrumptious beyond amazing!!! The burgers are by far thee best burgers i have ever tasted!! So juicy so melt in your mouth so perfect. This place is a must try! If you are an ASU student they pay for the first round of beer! Can't beat that! The ambiance is she perfection.. makes one feel as if they are by a beach. The customer service is also amazing. Everyone truly cares here. It truly
Shows that they add a lot of love to their food. I will be back tomorrow for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and amazing service! It did take a little while to get our food, but it was well worth the wait! Didn't expect the tacos to be as big as they were and have as much meat in them as they did. The burgers were amazing as well. Everything about this place screams -yummy!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food (love the fish tacos) and the hospitality is why we've become regulars. Can't say enough great things about this pseudo island getaway (reminds me of Key West)."}
{"text":"Unusual experience on the service end. We arrived shortly after they opened at 11am. Guy took our food and drink order. Did not write anything down. Drinks were brought out to us but kitchen worker came out and asked how my husband wanted his build his own \"kahuna\"burger. Then when my husband's food was brought out, I had to ask about the fish tacos I ordered! They were then brought out-and were delicious! Great blackened fish, flavorful slaw and sauces, generous portions, coleslaw really good with cilantro flavoring. Husbands burger and fries were good but they failed to provide the cheese he requested. Good beer and margaritas. Drinks reasonably priced and they made the errors tolerable by giving us a free round of drinks. Later server Dezmond F. was a super worker!"}
{"text":"Check out the pics, place was all hype but when I finally got a taste, I was pretty disappointed..nothing to brag about other than the service and cheap drinks"}
{"text":"First time, awesome food. Wipeout taco combo/great customer service, will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Well we just left there 8:20 pm on 2/24/2017. We walked in. The one person working the counter burly noticed us. Said he will bring menus to us in a moment. 20 minutes later still no menus. So we get up to leave. The guys says did you want anything to eat. My husband says well you seem to busy closing the restaurant to wait on customers. He said ok great then have a great night. Even though they don't close till 9:00 pm he locked the door after we left. Ummm really? I have only been there on other time it wasn't that great. Not sure I will be back especially if service is that bad. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"See allot of good reviews.  I did not care for my chicken mush bowl at all... Was way over-sauced with a vinegar-ridden sauce.  Server even said \" Too much vinegar, huh\", like they know there is a problem.   Corn fritter things were raw batter inside.  Got scared the meal was going to make me sick.  Couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"We get lunch here occasionally at work.  LOVE the burgers!  All the tacos seem to please everyone that orders them.  Not really impressed with the bowls.  Other than that, nothing to criticize.  It's a solid recommendation for lunch."}
{"text":"Such a cool little find! Island flavor decor. A few taps and bottled beers. Thank heavens they made a Bloody Mary for me, I don't drink all that often but kinda wanted one all day to drown out this migraine. There's a table with bright color Cadillac type seats. If that table is open grab it! There are a few different sauce combinations from little spice to fuego hot! I got the Baja sauce on crispy fish tacos with a mango salsa which was right in the middle. The waitress was super attentive. Felt right at home. Definitely stop on and check it out!"}
{"text":"$4.50 for a cat fish taco? You've got to be kidding me. With a name like Jimmy Hula's I figured it would be a little more exotic like maybe ahi tuna or mahi mahi. All my years in Hawaii I don't remember ever seeing catfish tacos."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Jimmy Hula's with lots of interesting fish tacos to try! Yummy! They also have a range of drinks. Cool place with boat chairs at some tables. :-) This is a new restaurant just getting started with friendly staff....give them a try!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I tried this place for lunch last week and kinda knew what to expect from the Yelp! pictures and the menu. Man, that was an understatement.

The plethora of fish taco flavorings was pretty immense. We both tried two of different kinds and were not disappointed. My blackened fish tacos in two different styles were large and fantastic. The list of different styles of toppings and sauces is large and I'll be back to try more or all of them.

They've turned the old Long John Silver's into a Gold winning lunch spot!"}
{"text":"MacNCheese with BBQ Pork tacos, Teriyaki Chicken tacos and many more.  To top it off delicious sauces and seasoned fries. You've got my Boss sauce infused heart JH's . I'll be seeing you when taco tuesday comes a callin!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. Everyone is super friendly. The place is clean and the atmosphere has a really comfortable vibe to it. The voodoo tacos & wipeout tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"About 30 minutes ago me and my girlfriend walked in and took a seat the server noticed us and said he would be with us shortly after about 5 minutes go by and then I noticed the two other empty tables got sat and then he gave them menus and drinks instantly he walked by and ignored us 3 times and about 10 minutes went by so we just left on our way out I was hoping he would say something to get us to stay or at the least apologize but he just made eye contact and continued, then I mentioned the great service to him out of frustration and he then replied commenting about our patience and I am pretty upset just because this isn't the first time I have experienced terrible service here and I truly do love the food but if I can't even get menus or a guy to take my order then I guess I just will not try anymore."}
{"text":"This is a Great place, I love the hamburgers.... but once in a while I cheat and get the tacos made with boneless hot wings... its a hard choice.."}
{"text":"I'm so torn. First visit we loved it. Interesting food choices, from the grilled avocado, to the awesome corn, to the pork luau tacos with pickles. With pickles! Game changer. Was all set to come back. And then? Saturday happened. Had a group of 11 meeting us there for my birthday. On our way in an Uber and they call saying they're in the parking lot but no one is there. I reassured them they were new and not very busy. They clarified there was no one there, including the employees. The lights were on and so were the TVs, but the doors were locked. What? Were they coming back? Closed for the night? No one knew. The only thing we could come up with was the ASU game was happening. Had to scramble for new plans and ended up going somewhere with slow service and boring food. Was so disappointed. Really talked this place up to my friends and family. Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food AMAZING, the staff is AWESOME! I'm from Cali here for Spring Training and I would recommend coming here before hand!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  I drove 13 miles to try this place after having passed it a few times on my way through Tempe.  I walked in and the red\brown haired female employee at the bar had her back to me.  Waited for a few more moments and eventually just picked up a menu on the table behind me but it was actually a listing of their sauces.

After waiting another ten minutes she finally turns around and makes eye contact with me.  I ask \"Can I place a to go order here at the bar?\"  in response, she scowls and rolls her eyes at me and says.  \"Look, you're going to have to wait, okay?\"  Keep in mind, there's about six other people in the restaurant and no one else is anywhere near the bar.  I give it the benefit of the doubt and decide to wait and I say \"Sure, is there a menu?\"  to which she replies \"You know?  We're closed!\"

This is odd because I was standing there for some time with no greeting, no acknowledgement and no signage telling or showing me they were closed.  I'd be happy to leave it at that but her attitude for no reason at all was really a surprise.  I would encourage anyone I know or reading this to AVOID this restaurant at all costs.  It's too bad that employees ruin it for their ownership with this kind of behavior.  I definitely will not be going back here ever again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few times since it opened. Have only been for lunch.  This used to be a Long John Silvers, so it has a somewhat unusual layout.  All things considered, they did a nice job with the remodel. 

Every time I go, I get the combo plate which is two tacos, fries, coleslaw, and a drink.

My go to is the Wipeout taco (steak, shrimp, fries) and the killer shrimp taco. 

I think I would like the restaurant a little more if it was a fast casual restaurant instead of sit down. Food has all been very good and service is quick and attentive.  This is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Great food and service! It's new. Needs some talking up. Had the best burger!"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome! Best burger I've had in awhile definitely not a regular drive through! Super amazing food!! Definitely a must stop place!"}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian burger- forget the name of it, but it was juicy and full of flavor. Lots of beef. The fries were exceptional. They had a spicy Rubin them that was wonderful. Our waitress was pleasant, fast and attractive.  I'll eat here again. Prices are right as well."}
{"text":"We were looking for a yummy bite to eat and were lucky enough to stop here. GrEAT surfer type decor,  Very friendly staff and the food was really good. A great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I live around the corner and I've been trying to come at least once a week. Their menu is awesome, very unique items with something for everyone. The fish tacos are awesome, I love the killer with blackened fish. The bowls and burgers are great too. The management is great and cares about building the business too. Happy to have them so close to me. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The food was good and prices are decent. The staff seems slightly confused, or at the very least, easily distracted. 

I was told I needed to try Jimmy Hula's since I live so close by. I was craving a burger and figured this would be the perfect time to try. I go through the drive-thru and had a bit of a hard time ordering. The guy taking my order was very nice but didn't know the menu well. I spent about 3 minutes repeating my order. I wanted the Duke with Mac n cheese. He seemed to ramble off other items on the menu, trying to figure out what I was ordering, while asking someone else in the restaurant for help. When we finally settle my initial order, I asked about the different fries options but he didn't seem to know what they were. He kept saying a proprietary blend of spices. I shrug and just go with my original order. 

I didn't have to wait too long, a couple more minutes and the burger was out. The burger came with a side of fries and a small soda. For a decent sized burger meal between $7-9, I didn't think it was a bad deal. The only problem was that when I got the burger, there was both cole slaw & mac n cheese on it. There was no pork or onion ring. Not exactly how the burger was described, but tasty all the same. 

Hoping they get the order right next time :)"}
{"text":"Such a fun and friendly place!  Great low-key atmosphere and friendly outgoing staff.  Oh, and the food was great!  Love the fire-roasted avocado!!"}
{"text":"Almost didn't come in, but so glad I did!  Fish tacos are great!  The blackened fish inside mixed with the spicy sauce, and was fantastic. I appreciated the homemade fries. Friendly service.  Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"This was such a cool find! We were just driving by and decided to stop by because we saw the sign that said 'food nirvana.'   We made the joke that they are sure setting high expectations.  Well, they were great! The food was fantastic.  It was extremely flavorful and their jimichurri bowl was absolutely fabulous.   The customer service was great as well.  Everyone was very welcoming, friendly, and quick with getting us our food and our drinks.  It's definitely a place you want to check out."}
{"text":"Had burger.  Didn't taste too great.  Wait service was sub par.  They did that thing where they make you leave a tip while they wait for you to see how much tip you'll leave..  Will not visit here again.

  I think just had bad luck and got a bad server and cook, or maybe their burgers aren't that good. It was 1pm Saturday"}
{"text":"Went there today for the 1st time with my boyfriend. Glad we checked it out. Food tasted great, good service, cool decor, and awesome pricing. We definitely plan on going back! I hope the business sticks around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is different. The place it's self is nicely decorated I ordered a few things from the menu, nachos were delicious !! And a burger which was done medium well. I believe that's how all the burgers are cooked. Which is not my personal favorite I'm a well done type of person. So if you go and don't like medium well ask the server if they can cook it a bit longer. I didn't read the menu where it stated that they cook their meat like that. I catches that after I had already placed my order. But regardless it was good. Will return p.s they also have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had dinner tonight and enjoyed everything. The fire roasted avocado was delicious as well as our juicy kahuna burgers. Service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very laid back and fun but the full service and option to get a beer with dinner adds a nice touch. This is not your typical Hawaiian joint like Aloha, Rumbi, etc, and as long as you know that going into it, you will not be disappointed. The menu mostly consists of burgers (smash style) and tacos with a few salads and bowl options. The food is great, service is on point and the owner (we think) is always there and engaging and kind to all his guests. Can't wait to go back and try something else! I read some reviews that stated things that we did not encounter at all, with that being said, this is a new restaurant and people should take that into consideration when writing reviews. Cooks are still learning, servers are still finding their stride and hiccups may occur, this is normal and completely acceptable in any business. Support local, be happy and when trying new places, have an open mind!"}
{"text":"Food is actually surprisingly good. The burgers are greasy and messy but the flavor makes up for it. The French fries definitely need work, they're super soggy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for the first time, and the experience did not disappoint!  The menu has a lot of great food to choose from.  We chose to have their hamburgers and they were awesome! (The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the french fries were a little limp and I like mine crispy.)  The employees were super friendly and the ambiance in the restaurant was very festive!  The chairs at the booth we sat in were car seats!  It was a thirty minute drive for us, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch with a co-worker.  We both LOVED our meals!  This place is a new concept to the area and WORTH  a visit!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed the last 2 visits. The fish in my tacos was so overcooked I couldn't even chew it. They forgot the sauce for my fries and I waited almost a half hour for my take out order, there was no one else there so not sure why the wait. I had been there before and the food was great. Very inconsistent food quality, however the servers are always great"}
{"text":"Not the place to visit if you're hoping for Hawaiian BBQ. I feel the name Jimmy HULAS with a strong Hawaiian theme was slightly deceiving. My first impression of the menu was that they were serving Mexican food. Nachos, Guacomole & chips, \"Crak'd out corn\" also known as Elote is Mexican establishments. They do attempt to add some sort of tropical twist but I feel the food still lacked flavor. 

My husband & I both were very disappointed. He ordered the Malibu & Killer tacos. I ordered the Voodoo & Jimmichurri tacos. All 4 tacos were stuffed with far too much lettuce or cabbage (depending on the taco). The \"Jimmichurri\" lacked flavor and felt like plain oil poured into my taco. The fries were very greasy and soft. Our daughters refused to eat their chicken quesadillas (YES MORE MEXICAN). 

Our server was sweet, maybe a little too attentive. Not too big of a deal. 

I left upset at myself for paying $40+ on that meal and we will not be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had a big group with lots of picky kids, and it was fast and everyone enjoyed their meal. Don't be afraid of the Johnny Utah, it's killer!!! A little taste of everything. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best taco in town hands down. No kidding. Jimmy Hula's has so many varieties (fish, pork, steak, chicken, veggie...) and so many ways they cook each option. Grilled, blackened, BBQ, fried... They put a Hawaiian spin on many. The place has a real island feel to it. Cold beer, Indoor/outdoor feel. The guy with the dreadlocks is such a happy fellow. I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"This place has one of my favorite burgers and the first 3 times I went here it was awesome, good food, good service, and a good price. However, the last time I went I learned that they don't take your order at your table anymore which I wasn't that upset about at first but soon after I realized that it was a complete pain. Trying to communicate with someone to get a fork or a knife took 5 minutes alone. It seemed like they open at 11 and the employees got there at 10:55 and didn't think they were going to be busy... I'm disappointed Mr.  Hula."}
{"text":"Came here before work on a Monday morning for breakfast. Pulled in to the drive thru and ordered 2 of the breakfast sandwiches. The price and taste were both good, however there seemed to be only one person working the whole place which made it take a while for things to get done. I would say it took approximately 12ish minutes for the time I ordered to the time I got my food, so if you are trying to grab a quick bite before work, I am not sure if this would be the best place. Also I ordered the combo which on the menu said it came with a drink, so I asked for coffee but when I pulled up to the window it seemed like there was some confusion if coffee was included with the combo which I thought was strange because I don't know what other beverage you would get with breakfast. Overall the food was decent and reasonably priced. I would come here again if I wasn't in a rush to get somewhere else."}
{"text":"VooDoo Taco and Aloha Burger are awesome!  Made our trip to Phoenix memorable.  It's a very casual place where you can relax and just have a good burger.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  But, the burgers and tacos are gourmet quality."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!! A friend and I ate here for lunch the other day and it was far better than I had anticipated. 

The building itself was decorated really cool and it was very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful; their service is great. As for the food, I went with the \"combo\" which has two tacos, fries, and a drink. For my tacos, I went with the Original and the Wipeout. Both were fantastic! I also got an order of Crack'd Corn which was one of the better decisions I've ever made.

I'll definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Everything was AWESOME!!

Not sure where to start. 
First of all, pay no nervermind to the losers who posted 1 or 2 stars.
EVERY food joint on the planet will  have someone who doesn't like for one reason or another.
When its 1 or 2 or 3 bad reviews out of 40...it doesn't affect my decision at all.
Plus, if you walk into a place, ASSUMING what type of food they serve, you will probably be disappointed. Try using the technology you used to make a review on Yelp, and try looking up the menu before you go. :)
I had the Burnt Reynolds burger.
WOW, yeah delish. Piled with bacon, fried egg, cheese and potato chips!!!
The cracked corn is soooooooo good!! yes its a tropical take on Mexican Street Corn.
AND ITS AWESOME!!!
ITS ALL GOOD!!
That's all im gonna say.
GO THERE.

NOW."}
{"text":"Today  (9/24/2016) we went to Jimmy Hulas based on all the great reviews. This was one of the worst experiences at an establishment I have ever encountered. We were a party of six, and we seated ourselves, as instructed, outside in the patio area. We did not get any service for about 20 mins. There was one waitress working the whole restaurant, and the Manager brought us our drinks. He then informed us that he had been hired \"four hours ago\" and was unable to answer any questions we had with the menu. Later, the waitress informed us that the entire staff was let go the day prior, and they had new cooks in the kitchen, ect. 

We arrived at 7:45pm, and our food came out at 9pm. Our food was cold, the tortillas were cold, the fries were burnt and soggy. And, to top it all off, the food arrived in to go boxes. We did not make a fuss, we calmly waited for our food thinking at least the food will make up for the abhorrent service and wait.  They also did not bring out correct orders, and a few members of our party did not eat, and that was extremely disappointing. 

The food was mediocre, not much to judge when it was cold, burnt and arrived an hour later. We were really overlooking the lack of service and awful wait, but this was a terrible terrible experience. 

I had high hopes, and today was a disaster of epic proportions."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place tonight and the food was OUTRAGEOUSLY DELICIOUS. We had a chimichurri bowl with beef and a pork sandwich. Both the food and the service were so good! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe going on here with an island/ surf atmosphere and some good reggae playing. Stopped by for lunch and the service was good. I ordered the fish taco combo. Which comes with a choice from the menu of two fish tacos, coleslaw, fries and drink. 

The food came out quickly and is served in a basket. the fish tacos were well packed and of decent size, but I was disappointed in the portion of coleslaw in a tiny plastic cup about a tablespoon and very few fries. It's enough food but I think they could beef up the portions of slaw and fries. 

I like the atmosphere and the food is decent and fair priced. I expect to go back."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Unique and charming Hawaiian decor, and so many fantastic burgers and tacos to choose from. We'll definitely come back when we're in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Was greeted at the door with a menu and offering of a drink. I asked for an iced tea.. sat down to peruse the menu.. noon lunch \"rush\" there were maybe 5 tables occupied. I watched and waited rather patiently and made my selection.. combo seemed most reasonable the menu on the drive through is $.75 cheaper on tacos than inside the items looked good on the menu.. no tea ever arrived and no one asked for my order nor approached to direct me towards the counter for service so I got up and I left....
Hoping that they turn the place back into a long john silvers"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, expect lots of fried food choices though. I thought the hamburger was extremely tasty but the fries were soggy and limp.  Most of the beer selection was from the larger breweries and those with a hawaiian theme, sorry but Kona kind of sucks as a beer, how about bringing in some Maui beer for a good hawaiian beer. If you want beer Boulders on Broadway down the street has a better selection however the food is better at Jimmy Hula's.  Staff was great, their wifi wasnt working so the server connected us to his own personal hotspot."}
{"text":"Well...revising my previous...was disappointed to learn today that the personal service of taking your order at your table that they offered when they opened has been cancelled....they are trying to act more lile a fast food chain versus a resturant....food still awesome....just disappointed with the reduced/elikinated personal service....they will dedinately see reduced tips as wwll because who tips for no service.

Still worth a try however"}
{"text":"Mid afternoon, slow but service was outstanding. Recommendation to go with fish tacos - outstanding. Zucchini fries - outstanding. Cold beer - outstanding. Do you think I will come back to this location. No question no doubt!  Nothing like this at home. Definitely would be a hit from where I come from. Enjoyed this."}
{"text":"Went in not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised with the food. The Duke burger with Mac and Cheese was awesome as was the Wipeout taco, Johnny Utah and Teriyaki tacos were very good as well. Fries were a bit soft but tasted great. Service a little awkward but it was obvious she just hasn't had a lot of experience yet! It'll come. In the meantime, we live nearby and will happily frequent!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try something different and I've passed this place probably a dozen times so I finally went in. Ordered two tacos and mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was very much ok. Nothing special, but not bad either. The tacos were both pretty good, I ordered a Wipeout and  a Luau and it's a nice change from normal tacos you'd get everywhere else. Service was good, especially considering how busy it got after I arrived. It was like coming in right before a rush."}
{"text":"Lunch today. I never go out because nothing fast food is ever good. Jimmy hulas changed my mind. Fresh flavorful absolutely delishus. Call in the order it's waiting for you. The fish taco was crunchy with lots of toppings. The tropical salad was so fresh and flavorful. Absolutely highly recommend"}
{"text":"These fish tacos are flames best kept secret in Tempe. Also have to get the key lime pie"}
{"text":"Diablo was good. Asked for it protein wrapped but got it with no bun. Salad for a side was ok. Nice waitress. Cool seating. Good price."}
{"text":"I have only been for breakfast and man it is delicious! Their breakfast sandwiches are little pockets of yummy! They are sealed up with all of the ingredients inside which keeps them really hot and the combo includes tater tots. Definitely one of my favorite quick breakfasts by work. The only reason why they get 4 stars and not 5 is that they aren't that quick. If you have the time to wait in the drive thru for a few minutes then definitely stop here because it is well worth the wait instead of the crummy fast food joints all around here. Loco Moco breakfast is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place the tacos were stale I must have came on a bad day. Ill try it again tho."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this shop around 4 pm on a weekday after a short commute from Texas to Phoenix. We were staying at the hotel down the street. I ordered the Hula taco and cracked corn and my coworker ordered another type of taco. Instead of lettuce, I subbed cabbage on my Hula Taco. The taco was amazing!!! The corn? It was extremely overroasted. I would recommend this place and would definitely return if we stay at the Phoenix Doubletree Hilton again."}
{"text":"Their food is super delicious! I live around in the neighborhood & cant get over this hidden gem. They have a very broad menu with lots of selections & all the food has been delicious. Their cracked corn is so good!!! Very enjoyable!!"}
