{"text":"We eat out in the neighbourhood a lot and Mogette is a favourite of ours. The quality of food is top notch, the chef takes care in each dish and makes the simplest meal delicious. We have never had a bad meal there. The staff are professional and take care of you. The desserts are to die for and change regularly as do the specials (also always amazing). Definitely the best french restaurant in the area. I think they may get mistaken for being too conservative or upscale but their prices are the same as other french restaurants around but they have better food. Don't let the table cloths intimidate!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Delicious food and excellent service. My first time here with the whole family and even the kids loved it. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Attentive service.  Seafood was fresh and meticulously prepared.  Even the bread was good.  Intimate ambiance.  Efficient kitchen (food didn't take long to come like in most French restaurants). Owner aimed to please each customer. Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant last week! We were just passing by and decided to walk in and check it out. The restaurant has a new chef who went above and beyond to make sure he accommodated all of our requests. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Brief review
Food was excellent.  I started with traditional onion soup, cheese melted perfectly
Entree was a boulabaise with mussels, calamari, shrimp and white fish, perhaps halibut
My wife started with a salad, nothing special but ok,
Main was mussels in blue cheese broth and frites 
She thought this was fabulous 
Restaurant was quiet, service was therefore just perfect"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to use my Groupon for this place. A bit frustrating trying to get in for lunch as they only take reservations a day in advance.  You just can't walk in.  After two failed attempts we booked ahead and went.

It was well worth it.  The ambiance is clean, simple and comfortable.  The French Onion soup was superb as were there Steak Frites, warm goat cheese salad and Rainbow Trout mains.  I would definitely go back.  

A word of advice to the owners, either open for lunch or don't and just focus on dinner service.  Unfortunately the area is not full of offices with a lot of workers looking for lunch.  And that's too bad. I do hope this place succeeds though.  It's fine French fare at a reasonable price and excellent quality."}
{"text":"An update to my recent review of Mogette.  I have been there again twice in the past month with friends & family for dinner.  The food was excellent both nights.  Both nights I again ordered the Saddle of Lamb which I complained in my original review had come overcooked.  Both times it was cooked to perfection.  And it was a very generous portion.  Other mains ranged from Boeuf Bourgignon to Beef Tenderloin to Mussels with Blue Cheese to Steak Tartare.  All were very good.  Bottom line - Mogette's food is very good and the pricing is reasonable.  However, service is a real weak spot at Mogette.  The servers were different on each of my 3 visits and each time they were very inexperienced.  They were earnest and tried hard.  But what they clearly needed was a senior server or floor manager to co-ordinate their activities.  That's a role to owner could have played - since he was on-site for each of our dinners.  He could have helped with clearing tables, opening wine, filling water glasses and guiding rookies who were struggling to cope.  But he didn't.  It's a shame.  Because even people like me, who like Mogette's food, won't put up with the poor service for long.  Here's hoping they can elevate the service to the level of the kitchen.  Soon!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. 
Good food one waitress overworked so we waited 45 mins for apps. Not her fault. Worst thing was chef yelling at her and swearing in French at her. When confronted by another paying customer who was disgusted at how he was treating the waitress. Chef yelled at her and told it was none of her business. 3 families got up and left. I was angry and embarrassed for waitress."}
{"text":"Had the soup du jour as an appetizer, which was a sweet pea soup, and was delicious.  The steak frites was a melt in your mouth steak, and crispy fries with an aioli.  I had a lovely brownie with toffee sauce for dessert.  Everything was just great and enjoyed the ambiance as well."}
{"text":"We were at Mogette last night for the first time and certainly not the last!  We were very pleasantly welcomed and seated.  Our server told us of the different specials that night and was most pleasant when we asked questions.  I ordered the French onion soup and the grilled Calamari (main course) and my daughter ordered the grilled Calamari and the Mussels (main course). Everything came to the  table hot and the service was excellent.  Our meals were delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  It is worth going back again!"}
{"text":"Walked out!
We went out for a nice evening out at a nice restaurant and we were met with a mouthy, swearing chef. And the fact that we were served after other people arrived, didn't help. We have never seen this before!  The chef was verbally abusing the staff because they thought that they were a god. And management wasn't doing anything about that. Sorry, we don't have to listen to that on our dime!  And we weren't the only people that got up and left. A nice family with children left because their children were afraid. When we run into this, we don't care how good the food is. That was inexcusable. The owners need to fire this guy or their business will greatly suffer, if not go under. They can't afford that in his neighbourhood!  Too many good restaurants in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great place, just a few things keeping it from getting the 5 stars (like consistency?) 

Onion Soup: good flavours, cheese was perfect, bread was completely soaked through though
Grilled Calamari: Great combination of ingredients, really enjoyed the taste!; would have preferred a good sear on it

Lamb: asked for medium rare
-1st plate: 1 thick piece, cut, Medium well to well - taste was good but too cooked, potatoes were very nice and crisp, veg was good, sauce was on the side
-2nd plate: 2 thinner pieces, not cut, Medium rare & Medium - Medium rare had a nice \"gamey\" taste, medium had a very good sear, potatoes and veg were not as good
Veal stew: perfectly cooked and flavoured! 

Chocolate lava cake: AMAZING (slight bias since I ate most of this one, perfectly cooked, sweet but not too sweet + ice cream)
Upside down apple pie: Awesome! (Very nice tartness vs. sweetness of the pie/ice cream)"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: amazing food and service! This place is truly a hidden gem and definitely needs more recognition for what it offers.

My boyfriend bought a Groupon for this restaurant and we finally decided to go yesterday. All I have to say is that it was a fantastic experience overall. I was a bit skeptical because there aren't many recent reviews for this place so I wasn't really sure what we paid for.

We were seated promptly when we got to the restaurant for our reservation at 8:30PM. The restaurant is very clean and has a classy ambiance to it. The service is excellent-very attentive and catering to their customers. 

The food is basically where this restaurant gets a high rating. Amazing French food with unique flavors. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert and each item was tasty. The portions are HUGE. You get what you pay for. Probably one of the best French restaurants I have been to in Toronto-Hands Down!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the French bistro fare has been good and sometimes very good. The ambience is perfect for a cozy neighborhood bistro. The service is usually very good but my most recent visit on Valentine's Day was a bit disappointing.  Nothing horrible but not very good either particularly when there was a fixed menu.  Overall, a solid 3 stars. There are better options nearby so it may be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Steak Frites, onion soup for her, escargots and braised beef cheeks for me. All dishes above reproach! Service was attentive and friendly. Will make a habit of this gem."}
{"text":"Went again and loved it even more! They have the gnocchi as a solo dish now and I've been dreaming about it every day since."}
{"text":"I went to Mogette with my husband and parents for my 30th birthday. I wasn't lucky with my starter and main course, but the others were happier. I ordered a soup from the specials for a starter, which was not hot, and it was supposed to include a poached egg, which was completely hard. I returned it, and received another one after everyone else already finished their starters. The soup was hot this time, but it was blend and the egg was hard again. The others had onion soup which was nice and the calamari which was good. For main course I had the lamb. The owner promised it was a great dish and said \"he'd pay for it if I didn't like it\". It was served over-cooked and cold, and wasn't very hungry. I didn't return it because I didn't want to wait again but told him what I thought of the dish. Neither dish was taken off the bill. The others had the pot of fish and salmon, and liked them. We shared two deserts- creme brulee and apple tart, which were delicious. Overall, the food was mediocre (except for the deserts). The owner tried hard to give us good service, including singing for me a birthday song (a little embarrassing but nice of him) but he forgot the wine we ordered, and frankly, I'd prefer that he put more efforts towards making sure the dishes come out properly instead."}
{"text":"A very pleasant meal on a slow night for the resto. One young server was hard-pressed to handle the diners but did well. A smoked salmon-asparagus app was fine, and a tenderloin and vegs was cooked as ordered and excellent. Desserts were slow arriving but tasty.
  The only concern was noise--with a full house Mogette might be unbearable."}
{"text":"Excellent choices. Reasonable price for quality and portion size. Is quite noisy if full with diners otherwise could be a perfect romantic French restaurant."}
{"text":"Even though we were the only customers there for the entire dining experience, the service was still terrible (and as others have mentioned in their reviews, the chef was inexplicably yelling at the waitress from time to time, seemingly at random -- was very weird).  On top of that the heater was busted (during Winter of course) and it was freezing in there.   Honestly, i felt like we were an inconvenience to them by just being there, like we were stopping them from doing something they wanted to do -- maybe they were just angry that the ONE portable heater had to now focus on us. And after all this, the food, which could have rescued the whole experience, was mediocre at best!  I honestly thought we were in the wrong restaurant and had to double check in yelp.  Unfortunately we weren't.  Which sucks because we were all dying for a good French restaurant in our hood and the food did look great in yelp photos.  Something must have been happening behind the scenes for this to be so bad and different from what was advertised. I honestly don't like writing such negative reviews for restaurants, especially small ones that look family owned...and it's such a tough, competitive industry.  But i just can't find any positives about my experience there...an experience that was NOT CHEAP. 

Actually, i lied, i did think of a positive: The experience was so profoundly bad that I'd have to assume something was amiss and that my experience was not usual for them.  Oh, and the food didn't make us sick, so, there's that...

And so our search for an authentic, good, local French restaurant continues..."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for Mogette which gave us a value of $80 which would then just be deducted from our final bill. Which actually turned out to be a great deal. I usually use a groupon when trying out new places. 
I was look on forward to eating at Mogette because of the great menu options. My reservation was for 6pm however we around a bit early at 5:30. Since there was no one there we got seated very quickly. Our waiter was fantastic, very polite and very personable. The chef on the other hand was a definitely story, for whatever reason he insisted on making it a point to tell us that he would not start cooking until 6pm. Which I wish he hadn't done because it just made things awkward and I really didn't find the food to be delayed at all so it was a completely unnecessary comment to make. Thankfully the food made up for his attitude.
I ordered escargot and rigatoni and my boyfriend had salad and half a Cornish hen. The food tasted fantastic. It was seasoned nicely and all cooked very well. I honestly don't have a single complaint. For dessert we had creme brûlée which was also pretty perfect. Overall the experience was enjoyable, and I would probably come back again with another Groupon."}
