{"text":"We frequented this wonderful establishment on a regular basis.  It's a shame they've closed.  They had the best Lobster Rolls I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately, a low end beer and taco bar will probably take the space!   Bon Voyage Yacht Club!"}
{"text":"I went into yacht club hungry and angry from a hard day of work. When I sat at the bar and ordered a drink, I was pleasantly surprised by a wonderful personality and overwhelming rush of enthusiasm by a Mr. Wick. He heard my frustration of a long day and suggested a drink, called a \"Dinghy\". It was by far the best drink I have had in a while. Thank you Mr. Wick for lending an ear and suggesting a great drink! FYI-the calamari was the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is like walking into the Hamptons! Our server Austin was attentive and awesome. Great drinks...go for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Okay...just opened...still needs lots of work...seafood tough & not very
fresh...waaaaaay too loud...needs deadening devices...service ok....place is 
charming...nice remodeling job.....liked: French fries (order them Xtra crispy)
best I've had in AZ....octopus out of this world delishious ....calamari fries
really good....mgmt. really trying...will go back in a couple mos. Hope things
have come together by then."}
{"text":"My favorite item on the menu were the lobster rolls. they truly are to die for. I also enjoyed the cocktails and the atmosphere is really nice! Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at the Yacht Club last night...started with the Arizona clam chowder and arugula salad...different from most I've tasted at other restaurants. Both had lots of great flavors/ingredients and a wonderful spiciness that my husband and I really liked! For the entree, he had crab cakes and I had the chicken/shrimp/sausage jambalaya...no skimping on the protein and oh, so delicious! We will definitely go back to try more of chef Aaron May's culinary talents."}
{"text":"Cute on inside.  

We still had to wait 25 min after making a reservation. 

Terrible service. We had to flag down a server after 15 to even get water. They forgot our appetizer completely and food was only ok."}
{"text":"My first experience here was an okay one. Loved the decor and the whole East Coast nautical vibe. I agree with most that it is a little bit loud and hard to carry on a conversation.  

Service was not the best. Drinks took way too long when we ordered, and we were even there before the dinner crowd.  I ordered the same drink all night long and each one looked and tasted different, which was disappointing.  As far as food, we loved our appetizers; crab dip and cauliflower au gratin. Very tasty. I had the duck for dinner which was great!  Most everyone in our group had the fish tacos and enjoyed them, however, we had a friend get very, very sick after eating them due a gluten allergy, which we were told by our server were corn and not flour.  The manager did comp the meal and even paid for her ride home which was appreciated.  

This place has great potential once the kinks get worked out. I think maybe more training is needed for the servers and bartenders and the experience would be better."}
{"text":"If you like $1 Hawaiian Rolls from Fry's you will love this place. The lobster roll comes with a lightly warmed up Hawaiian Roll. To the very limited and unimaginative menu throughout this place makes for a lackluster appeal. Then compounded with waitresses who avoid tending to their tables as the bartender pours vodka straight into an unmarked glass for the waitresses to have something to do while avoiding any interaction with a customer. The entire restaurant is wood paneled to resemble a lake side tavern, but someone forgot to tell them that wood amplifies all sound. It registered on a slow night at 92 decibels (737 landing is 89!!!!) I recommend going down the street, really any other street in Arcadia to find a restaurant that would actually want to be in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"The lobster rolls were amazing. The interplay between creamy New England style and the unctuous, buttery Connecticut style surpassed my experiences back east. The service; however, left much to be desired. We were there on a Monday night with a light crowd. The servers, though very attractive, we're inattentive and seemed to implement a high school style gambit whereby their disaffection was intended to enamour."}
{"text":"Great service and drinks. I recommend requesting Austin and ordering a hot skinny martini marg!"}
{"text":"Food was great, had the halibut and crab dip.....Manhattan like drink OK.  Service pleasant but inconsistent.  I know it is new so will give then time.  The noise level though was totally unacceptable.  We (3) could not have a conversation and when I left I was hoarse.  About ten minutes before we left someone had the idea to turn the music down (maybe enough complaints) and immediately everyone stopped screaming over it.  Next time turn it off and let us enjoy conversation during our visit....may try again, but only once if noise level does not come down.
Just read previous reviews and the noise has been an issue since opening...apparently they don't care....disappointing."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and live in the Arcadia neighborhood. We visited Yacht Club last week and had an awesome experience.   Great food....try the lobster rolls Amazing.  They are as good as we get in Massachusetts as every summer our family vacations on Cape Ann.  Have Scott Wick mix you up the \"Perfect Storm\" or another yummy cocktail from their fun list.  Scott is the first person we met when eating here last week.  He told us so much about the creation of The Yacht Club (lights off of boats, oars on the walls from panama canal) to the delicious dishes we began to eat.  So go and listen to their 70's play list, relax in the great ambiance of the east coast vibe and give this neighborhood restaurant a try and definetly get the lobster rolls..you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoy this place every time I go there. Friendly people, great food, and fits great into the neighborhood. Check it out."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at the Yacht Club and it was delicious. I haven't been here for awhile and I won't wait so long to come back! Our favorites: lobster rolls (we got all warm instead of half warm half chilled lobster rolls - amazing!) hamburger (my daughter said the best burger she ever had) and the fish tacos. We all split a Caesar salad as well. Finally, I love the grapefruit beer that they serve here (I say \"beer\" lightly - it's refreshing and delicious!) come here and you won't be disappointed. I'm glad to have the Yacht Club in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this lovely restaurant recently and I give it TWO enthusiastic thumbs up. The ambiance was delightful, classy and very quaint. The food was outstanding. We had the crab cakes (pricey but worth every dime!) and the lobster rolls and both melted in our mouths. The servers and bartender were super friendly, on the ball and warm/welcoming. Perhaps the best kept secret in the Valley. Go! You'll love it. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Menu is diverse and amazing. Great place to close a business deal, a blind date, an anniversary, night with the family or even a night out with the boys.  Not a lot of places you will find that can accomplish this.  Most importantly the food will blow your mind; flavor explosion"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and really love this place.  I've had the lobster pasta, ceviche, fish tacos that were killer, and the fish and chips.  The service was prompt and done very well.  It's pretty hop for this area of town and definitely a needed amenity to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pretty much our worst restaurant experience of the year.  The interior design was attractive, about all that can be said positive about our visit.  The fish was overcooked, service verging on really bad and management totally absent.
With so many quality restaurants in our neighborhood I predict a short shelf life for the YC.

{"text":"We stopped in a few weeks ago for an after dinner drink with some friends, and were really pleased with the whole package. The staff and patrons were all friendly, and easy to connect with. 

We were so impressed, we  went back with other friends for dinner. Excellent choice. They served  the biggest blue points that I've ever seen, and they were awesome. We all ordered something different for our entrees, and we were all more than happy.

Neighborhood feel, yet attracting from all over, for a very good reason. It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Came here one time before when I was in town... It was fantastic. Figured I would try it again tonight with some friends. Such a great experience. From the ambiance to the cocktails and the meal. Started with the Poke, it was stellar. For dinner had the Halibut with the brown rice salad. One of the best fish dishes I have ever had. Highly recommend you ask the bartender to make you the Bitter Truth and the Dingy. Both very creative and tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 weeks ago with the family, not a good restaurant experience at all.
-had to wait 15 min for our 7:00 reservation, hostess was snotty
-we were sat near the bar, 5 of us couldn't have a conversation because of the noise
  literally had to yell at each other
-asked to be moved, no luck
-wait service was just ok
-calamari orders (2) were very skimpy
-did I mention the noise level????????
-the ceviche was good
-the brussels  sprouts were delicious 
-chicken was ok
-fish tacos were good but very small, not enough food
-salmon was good but very small piece, not enough food

We left hungry and went to 31 flavors for dessert!
For a $240 bill and lousy dining experience I felt robbed.

Hope things improve or this nautical newbie won't survive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beautiful decor. The lobster rolls are amazing!! You feel like you're on the east coast as soon as you walk thru the door."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.    I love to bring my friends and family.    It's just too bad my girlfriend doesn't like seafood or I'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Omg loved it! We've eaten at every restaurant in the city and this became instantly one of favorites. Such a nice change in scenery, felt like I was sitting in Boston or sandiego. Very fresh food, unique dish ideas, and great decor. Loved loved the octopus! Oysters were so fresh and so good. Tried my wife's lobster roles made two ways, ridiculous! That bread reminded me crispy cream doughnuts when they're fresh and melt in your mouth. So excited this restaurant is here, can't wait to go back and munch on some more octopus!! Nice to pay a little more for good sea food that has to be flown in. If Don't like the prices? Pete ' s fish and chips is walking distance away."}
{"text":"I drove by the other day and thought we should try it. We love seafood. They have done a great job rehabbing an old restaurant. Love the vibe. It's appealing to all ages. The menu was varied without being overwhelming. We started with the octopus and it was incredible. We will definitely go back for that. Then we had the mussels and the lobster rolls. The lobster rolls were really good. I liked the warm ones better than the cold, but they were all good. The mussels were good and large and the broth was fine. It could have used a little something, but was definitely good. People next to us had fish and chips and fish tacos and said they were good. Nice wine list without being overwhelming also. We don't go out often, but we will definitely go back. Great to have a good seafood restaurant inland."}
{"text":"The rating is as good as it gets - because it was!  As a 'regular dining couple' in 85018 eating out about 4 nights a week, the Arcadia area offers literally dozens of 5 star dining options.  A couple nights ago our experience was so good from the greeting, the service, apps, drinks and dinner - I just felt compelled to say a few things (as I rarely post reviews unless it's extra-ordinary).

For just the two of us, we enjoy dinner at the bar; good dialog, surroundings, patrons, etc. and on this occasion we got the perfect corner chairs to somewhat face one another.  After a warm greeting from the bartender, we immediately received water and asked about our drink of choice.  GREAT options on cocktails, beer and wine.  Traci went with The Mast Appeal (skyy grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit and finished with a splash of grapefruit which I highly recommend if you like grapefruit the least bit!).  They have about 20 craft beers (cans and bottles) to choose from - so I was nicely surprised with a few IPA choices and went that direction.

The appetizer we picked (which every guest should try) was absolutely spectacular:  Sol Y Sombra Chicken (crispy pulled chicken in a spicy and sweet glaze with a garnish of pickled red onions (which we did on the side).  Amazing!

For dinner, I went with Arugula mixed green salad and added grilled salmon.  Grapefruit, candied pecans and jalapenos, grape tomatoes with a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, fork-tender of course, and went terrific with the salad.  Traci went with the Halibut and Brown Rice Salad - and it was delicious, fresh and plentiful.

We wrapped up with a glass of red wine (for our desert)!  With a nice selection to suit our tastes we enjoyed the ambiance and chatted with our very personable bartender.

We've been a few times to The Yacht Club in the past - but we agreed upon our departure that this was our best experience and feel they are capitalizing on their strengths and finding their stride.  We will be back more regularly and put it on our 'must-do' Arcadia rotation!"}
{"text":"Love the concept and decor here. Also loved the variety of options and prices. While some at my table had pricier entrees (such as the scallops), I was thrilled that there was a DELICIOUS fish sandwich for only $13. I would definitely order it again. Also, I would go back just for the drink I had- First Mate (rum, apple juice, ginger beer, lemon and cinnamon). I normally love moscow mules (because of the ginger beer) but it was BETTER than any moscow mule. It's now my new favorite drink. 

Can't really comment to other people's noise comments. (?) We were there on a Saturday night and I didn't find it loud at all. 

I'm so excited to have this unique restaurant in the neighborhood and will definitely be back to visit and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ambience and the decor. The service was good too! I had the shrimp ceviche. I was looking for a light appetizer with a great glass of wine. It was a toss up between the ceviche, calamari or the tuna tar tar. The waiter suggested the ceviche. I thought it was ok. Not at all what you would expect for ceviche, in the southwest. Ill be back, but not for the ceviche. The ceviche at LGO, is much more my style and a modern, less traditional style of ceviche. My friend had the chicken wings. Not good. Boring, frankly! But, my favorite are oysters and the lobster roll. I'm willing to go back to support a local new seafood restaurant in Arcadia. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would ever find lobster and key lime pie this amazing in Phoenix.  I think it was even better than the spiny lobsters and key limes I used to eat when l lived in Miami!

Happy hour drink prices are very reasonable and the decor is impeccable.  The people I dined with said their clams tasted as fresh as the clams they dig off their beach on Vancouver Island.  

The only thing better than the food was the service.  Our waitress was cheery and attentive (and beautiful ;). The owner was onsite at 5pm on a Tuesday night to check in with us and tell us about the oysters they serve.  

This place shows true attention to detail.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, exceptional service, and really cool vibe. I have eaten dinner here twice and each time was a great meal. 
I had the fish tacos which were amazing! Each taco had a big piece of fish and an amazing sauce...so yum!
The shrimp tacos are good too but a little too sweet for me. The watermelon and corn was not my thing but it definitely was unique. 
Lobster rolls were good. It comes with 4 medium sized lobster rolls for about 21 bucks. Very tasty but not as awesome as the fish tacos. 
We celebrated my dads birthday here and the service was amazing. Everyone wished my dad a happy birthday and we were offered a complimentary dessert too. The staff was soo sweet to make the day special for us. 
The ambiance is really cool! The decor is like you're sitting in a yacht. Dress is casual. 
Overall, it's a great experience and I would return!"}
{"text":"While our group thought the food was good, we ultimately concluded there is no real reason for us to return to The Yacht Club.  There is something about a nautical themed, seafood focused restaurant and thumping club music that just does not work well together.  The noise level only allows you to hear the person seated next to you.  Maybe it's not that the music is cranked - it could be the acoustics of the building but it was not pleasant, at all.  

The menu has nice options and prices about what you might expect.  It's not going to be an inexpensive dining experience overall.  We shared appetizers, a bottle of wine, 5 people had a cocktail, and 7 entrees for $65.00 per person. The 2 nightly fish specials were $42 and $45.  Only 1 person in our group selected 1 of the specials.  It was a hand-sized piece of fish over lentils, which seemed over priced to our group. 

As two other reviewers have mentioned, our appetizers were also served at the same time with our entrees.  It seems that being able to fire and serve an appetizer well before the entree is brought to the table would be restaurant 101.  Service does need to be stepped up, way up.  Is the restaurant relying on the name of the chef/owner?  If so, that's not going to be sustainable.  I hope they soon determine if they're going for the club crowd or dining crowd and retrain their servers."}
{"text":"This place was OKAY. Nothing special & for being called yacht club the seafood selection was very small. I wouldn't go back, Arcadia has so much more to offer in culinary scene. Highlight was the decor, it was on point."}
{"text":"Came here following movie night and was quite surprised. I ordered the lobster pasta and my wife had the chef special cod and both dishes were delicious. Being a born and raised New Englander I am picky... Especially with lobster yet this delivered. Also loved the ambiance and decor of the place. A very limited dessert menu would be my Only slight knock yet what we ordered, the cobbler, was great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was ok  
Good attitude by the staff
Average food from the kitchen 
We will try again maybe we ordered some of the wrong items."}
{"text":"Charming and quaint inside. Feels as if you are on a yacht. Ordered a cognac and they served it to me in a shot glass. Service was horrible and it took forever to order and then receive our drinks. Hopefully the place will improve over time. If they can make the service and food as good as the inside of the restaurant looks they would really have something special! The floors are a piece of artwork."}
{"text":"Pack a sweatshirt and get ready to be transported to New England (the AC is turned up high so it's cold!). The food is yummy and service had been great. I highly recommend the calamari it is delicious and great for sharing. The fish and chips are great because the breading is light and the fish is flaky. The lobster pasta is very good. The lobster is fresh and light and the pasta is made in-house. I also recommend the Arizona clam chowder...it reminds me of The Missions soup but it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally got to have their well known lobster rolls !!

Great restaurant , very good food ! Lobster rolls were  very delicious. We loved the crab dip too ! Love all the lighting ( from old ships ) . 

We can not wait to come back ! Halibut looked great and heard the clam chowder is yummy ! 

And Scott behind the bar is so funny and very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great cocktails - I loved the \"Mast Appeal\". Crab legs, Califlower Au Gratin, and Lobster Rolls are a must."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here, again! They did bring their Arizona Clam Chowder back! Tacos are always a hit and their staff is extremely friendly! You  enjoy your evening at this neighborhood must! Try it out if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved the decor, a nice change. The room is far too noisy. I could hardly hear myself think! And the booming music added to the confusion. Chris, our waitress was sweet as could be. I think they need to decide what they want to be. The menu choices didn't make sense. Cheeseburger, fish tacos and $32 salmon.  The tacos should have been $2 each. Nothing else on the plate but 3 lonely tacos. At $11, not great. We ordered octopus for our appetizer. It was delicious, fish tacos and fish and chips for dinner. They were just ok. The batter on the fish fell of with each forkful, and the fish alone had no seasoning whatsoever. Salt and pepper would have helped. Awesome tarter sauce. One cocktail was ordered and our bill for dinner was over $65. I don't see a reason to return."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars but the truth is the drinks are weak, service is poor & the only reason to go is to try the lobster rolls & I was very impressed with the Shrimp Cocktail. My friend had the scallops and was not impressed. For the price point they need to have top notch service. The bartenders looked as if they just graduated high school. Oh well."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Loved the bright boat decor!  Lobster rolls are spectacular!!  Fish and chip delicious. The mussels are divine and the crab dip was superb!  We will definitely be back. Excellent food service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had.  Started with the lobster rolls, then the fish tacos and finished with the lobster pasta.  Unbelievable!!!!  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Friendly and I loved the way they teamed the tables.

I want to go back now."}
{"text":"unreal !!!!! great staff, great place, great food. 
new menu is awesome"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...I love how they pulled the nautical theme off throughout the entire restaurant.  The staff was so welcoming, professional and fun.  But, the food stole the show...it was amazing.  All 4 of my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  We all enjoyed a catch of the day and loved it!  I had the salmon with grain mustard sauce with rice and broccolini - yummy!  The other guests in my party had the scallops with lemon and herb sauce and the halibut with lime and coconut sauce - everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"Was glad to find this restaurant on restaurant week listing. If you have never been here I would highly suggest not to look the address up on Google maps. This place was very welcoming and the staff was very pleasant. The two of us ordered six of the eight items on the restaurant menu and everything was very delicious. We share each dish. They even had a sale on the wines. The restaurant was pretty busy for a Wednesday night and I could tell why. Can't wait to try this place again! I would have given five stars but I only do that after a second visit."}
{"text":"I'm okay for paying a high price for good food. This was not the case. If you want seafood, you may want to try another restaurant. Bizarre menu with odd tasting dishes. The service was fine, although it was \"mean girls\" hostess seating. They may want to crack a smile at any point. 

I hope they change the menu because it could have potential."}
{"text":"Great addition to the valley!  An exciting menu complimented by an outstanding list of cocktails.  There is a high caliber of experience behind this restaurant and the food and overall guest experience proves it.  Staff and management were all very attentive and gracious.  Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just saw this place passing by one day and stopped this evening.  SPECTACULAR!  AMAZING! FRESH! That's three words for this place.  The YACHT CLUB POKE and crab cakes are unbelievably amazing!  Great atmosphere and ASHLEY was very nice and made sure we had a great experience.  Special orders?  No problem.  Great place you have to stop if you want an amazing dinner, appetizer or happy hour!  First class and no disappointments here! The poke was so amazing I I ordered one to go!"}
{"text":"Love this Place! Great grilled Octopus! Bright and Airy Space! All the food is outstanding! The Lobster is Wow! This kind of place in Phoenix!!!! Seriously! I feel like I need to pinch myself that I am not sitting in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"We've exchanged one overpriced restaurant for another one. Boo! And NO HAPPY HOUR?????? WTF???????? NOT A FAN right now."}
{"text":"Omg, so cute!!!! This is my new favorite spot. Ask for Amanda to serve you. She's amazing!!!!! And Scott at the bar is the best bartender!!!!!! Aaron may is the best chef on this side of the country!! Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"With recent and sudden proliferation of 'high end' seafood restaurants here lately you'd think that we lived next to the ocean and that said ocean had no shortage of the finest fish.  Yacht Club now competes with the latest offerings from LGO (Buck & Rider), Sam Fox (Little Cleo's) or even Mastro's. This place is pretty middle of the pack.

The setting and ambiance are solid.  The menu is small but appears to respond to the seasons and availability.  Highlights are definitely the lobster rolls.  Everything else was slightly above average.  I was surprised at how chewy the scallops were.  The pork belly also didn't lend much to the dish.   The desserts were small but solid, a tip of the hat to the passion fruit brulee."}
{"text":"Decided last minute to try The Yacht Club for a date night dinner after a pretty busy week. We got there at about 6 pm on a Friday and there was no wait. We were promptly greeted and seated. I really love the decor and the entire build out as it truly feels like you are at a restaurant in The Hampton's. Our waiter Austin went over the menu and daily specials. I decided to go with the Lobster Roll (Connecticut Style with warm butter) and it was the best I've ever had! I'm already looking forward to having it again! Then for dinner I had Halibut with Red Quinoa, pineapple relish, coconut curry emulsion and WOW was that delicious! I'm a huge fan of coconut curry and this dish was off the charts good! My boyfriend went with the Baja Fish Tacos and he really enjoyed them a lot too. Then for dessert we split the Peach Upside Down Cake and that is a hidden jem! I love pineapple upside down cake but this was amazing! 

Austin our server was great! I cannot wait to go back again soon! I would highly recommend this place to anyone as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service at The Yacht Club was decent, but still seemed like they were smoothing things out as a newer restaurant would. Our waitress was in training but she was still very good. However, it did take quite a bit of time to get our cocktails (although that's also a sign that they were well made...and they were delicious!). 

My party and I went on a Tuesday night and it was mostly low key and not crowded at all. The decor is very cute and east coast-beachy. The menu is casual and offered options that included steak and burgers for those who do not only want seafood. I didn't find my arugula and quinoa salad to be very special but the calamari with lemon aioli and brussel sprouts with lemon and thyme were very good. Unfortunately there were really no vegetarian options besides the two arugula salads. I would certainly recommend this restaurant for meat and seafood lovers as well as anyone looking for a lovely ambiance."}
{"text":"While visiting family in AZ, we stopped in to have dinner and had such a great experience! Our server Errin was attentive and one of the best servers we have had while dining yet! We recommend the Halibut and Lobster roll, Amazing! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Being a New Englander I may be a tougher vote than others. Service was poor, uneducated in wine and the menu. My friend and I had to explain to her the difference between a Connecticut lobster roll and a Maine lobster roll. She could not explain the wine list at all. Oysters were extremely small and dry, fish and chips were rubbery and tasteless, lobster pasta had potential but served with spiral pasta, which really cheapened this pricier dish. Lobster rolls, once we described them properly to our server, were tasty and true to tradition. The ambiance  has a \"Scottsdale\" trashy feel and many of the clientele were there to be seen and definitely heard. It has a bar feel with subpar food. I don't see this place lasting long on our very culinary driven Indian"}
{"text":"Feel like you want to hang out at a yacht club but have no yacht? Well then this is the place for you. Really great interior including bar area. Lobster rolls to die for! Lobster pasta good too although not quite as good as the lobster rolls.It's pricey but the food was great and definitely worth more then one visit. They also do happy hour on Saturdays. Enjoy the beachy vibe!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and didn't know where to eat. I was craving seafood, and quite frankly, wasn't expecting much in Arizona in that department. The Yacht Club was really nice. Casual but comfortable with a nautical theme; the lobster rolls (2 ways) was a good value as well as super tasty. These four slider size rolls really filled me up. The next time I'm in town, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the seafood tacos which were decent size along with the potatoes as a side which were okay. The key lime pie was excellent though and very limey. Music is a little too loud for my taste, but at least it was good music."}
{"text":"Came back again to explore more of the menu. This time I made sure to bring my appetite. Started off with the calm dip and again it was amazing as I can remember. Also decided to try the octopus and couldn't pass up the clam chowder. Clam chowder was better than it was last time! I could eat it everyday! Octopus was cooked perfectly and had great flavor  

For entree decided to go with cheese burger cause I saw it come out twice and it just looked amazing. I'm so glad that I made that decision! I can't figure out what it is but there's something about it that makes it just unbelievable. Honestly surprised for a place that seems like you should get seafood but Aaron May never disappoints. 

Getting ready for the dessert course so will update after"}
{"text":"Nice decor, but the food wasn't memorable.  Starting at the beginning,  I hate to valet park my car when they just needed to move it 19 feet. Next the hostess was nice at the open front door. Though was clearly bored when I glanced at her later. Also the open front door was open and lead to quite a number of flies in the restaurant and wasted ac electricity. 
Our waitress was great!! She clearly explained the menu ... though did not know what seafood was sustainably harvested. To her credit, she did go back and find out. IMHO,  if you open a seafood restaurant these days, you menu should identify where and how the seafood is caught.
Onto the food: the calamari was cooked to a great tender state,  but was pretty greasy. My friend enjoyed his fish tacos,  but he could had gotten same quality down the street at Rubio's. My fish and chips was good. The fish to frozen steak fries ratio was off; yet, the fish was good.
I do want to come back and experience the lobster rolls. Hopefully they will had got rid of the flies by then!"}
{"text":"I planned to go eat at La Fontanella last night, and to my surprise, a new \"Arron May\" concept had taken over the iconic Arcadia Italian restaurant.

The Arcadia Yacht Club appears to be the new kid on the block in our little Arcadia hood. The fact that Aaron May and some veteran industry personalities are manning the decks, should hopefully liven up the area.

The skinny-jean clad, Little Woody scene just doesn't cut it. It's time to reform the neighborhood and season things up a little bit. ;)

As for the menu at the Yacht Club, it has not been officially published. I can say that after sampling a few items, such as the Connecticut Lobster Roll, and the Halibut with brown rice, coconut broth, and arugula salad, that I expect to see nothing but the best come from this new neighborhood joint.

Welcome to the hood boys!"}
{"text":"Certainly not the best seafood. It wasn't even ok. The Connecticut lobster roll was soaked in a butter oil substitute. The roll was soaked with it as well.  And it was in a Hawaiian roll!   Fish and chips were served with steak fries. Small portions and over priced.  If you are going to try to get close the east coast seafood, at least give it a better effort.  Service was just ok. Had to wait for ever to get the check."}
{"text":"Mixed review on the yacht club The service was amazing and the food was really good But the bartender made a weak,flavorless old fashion which is my pet peeve and my linen napkin had a stain on it It's a newer place so hopefully they address all that stuff and I'll leave a better review next time"}
{"text":"Amazing Lobster Rolls. I say get 3 of the warm and 1 of the cold just so you can try both, but I promise you, the warm is outstanding. 

Calamari was good too, but they dropped the lemon in the dip a little too much which over powered the taste. 

Beautiful ambiance, only losing 1 star due to pricing. Would highly recommend & come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what other posters were referring to regarding poor service:  we could not have asked for anything better!  From the manager who greeted us at the door to the wait staff, everyone was warm, friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was not super busy on this holiday weekend kick-off night, but there were plenty of servers and they acted as a team.  Like others , we tried the lobster rolls and fish and chips.  Both were fantastic!  Yes, it is a bit on the pricey side, but for fresh fish and lobster, I don't know what others were expecting.  The decor is adorable; I felt like I was in a New England seaside restaurant.  It was our first time and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to go here for a bit. We wanted the kinks worked out before we visited. 

None of us were very impressed. The decor and ambiance was great which made the food so disappointing! The service was ok, nothing special and all in all the place is cool, but the food...

So we started off with the calamari. It was good and tender but nothing we haven't had anywhere else despite the menu claiming it was rolled on chickpea flower or something. The sauce kinda tasted like mayo with a little lemon. I love mayo and all but if I'm getting calamari, I want something souped up. 

For dinner two of us had the New York strip and one had the fish tacos while the other opted for the linguini and clams. The New York strip wasn't a New York strip! It was another cut of meat that we thought could have been tender loin however it was too tough to be that. As far as flavor, it had a nice sear, but was pretty lackluster. The parsnips were like candy and so was the sauce served with the beef. More annoyingly, the plate was about the size of my torso...seriously. The play was so large and the food small and underwhelming...it was silly. The tacos were ok...I just figure if you're in Arizona, and you serve fish tacos, they have to be amazing. They weren't. So for the linguini, it was once again underwhelming, but again annoyingly, we sat down to dinner at 6:30 and the server was telling us that they may have 86'd that dish... I'm sorry it's a Friday night way before your rush and you might not have it? Luckily they did, but really, get your shit together!

I would not go back here for dinner. It's to pricey and to underwhelming. I would however come back to the bar. Apps- maybe not- but drinks for sure. The place is cool but if I'm going to get either seafood or a good steak at those prices, I'll go to a place that can cook and serve the right cuts."}
{"text":"Beautiful dining room, but hard to hear any conversations with your dining companions. Food was fine, not spectacular. Drinks seemed watered down universally and I've not heard my companions ever say that before. Service was pleasant, but rushed. Entree's came out with appetizers, was one faux pas. Since we had two birthdays, the staff gave us three desserts on the house that were pretty tasty. I wanted to like it more. If service gets better, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Celabrating our anniversary, my boyfriend made a reservation here.  food would be worth the price if the service stepped up....
1. they chose our reservation table for 2 to be a table that seats 4 in the middle of what seemed to be the noisy group room. There was a quieter room more suitable for two on the other side.
2. We ordered, and received our entrees with appetizer. Normally it's no biggy for me, because I'm ok eating cold food, but my boyfriends entrée was samon. Who wants to eat cold samon? They apologized profusely without us even complaining. We realized later they didn't really mean it because nothing on our $130 after tip bill had anything comped. It was thier error, normally if they are that sorry they will show it. They offered to \"refire\" the food. How wasteful! And I never send food back.
3. We saw a worker that looked like a manager downing a sangria. We know this cause it happened to be what I ordered.
4. On our way out the greeter was texting on her cell phone. 
We will come back, we know it's a new restaurant, but service needs to step up and someone needs to motivate and focus thier team. Drunk managers and texting greeters don't make great restaurants."}
{"text":"Best lobster rolls we've had since Maine!!  We got both the hot and cold and both were absolutely delicious, but my favorite were the warm ones!!"}
{"text":"We tried The Yacht Club for the first time tonight and it was awesome! The ambiance is comfortable and well balanced, the food was utterly perfect and our server was superb. Christin was attentive, helpful, and kind. The lobster rolls are a must try, as are the fish tacos. Overall, very impressed with this concept and what it has to offer."}
{"text":"Love this place- I'm from Florida originally and it has a legit \"coastal\" vibe.  Love the decor and the cocktails are fabulous.  Food was amazing, as was the service.  My favorite place for seafood now!"}
{"text":"What a delightful find!!
We were greeted at the door by the owner and a manager.  Both friendly and made us feel valued and welcome.
The interiors are fantastic.  Absolutely impeccable. Kudos to the interior designer and the owner for listening to them!
Our server, Kayleigh was fabulous!  We tried a sample of the Southwestern spin on clam chowder and skipped the cup and ordered a bowl!  Delicious with a subtle twist!  I had the lobster rolls which were SUPERB.  I tried them both ways: Connecticut style, warm with butter and Maine style, cold w a light sauce that was lovely.  Both great but next time I'm going Connecticut all the way.  Plenty of sweet lobster in every bite.
My husband had the Jabalaya which was also nuanced subtly and excellent.  
The bar looks comfortable and inviting and there is a welcoming vibe to the entire place.  Both owner and mgr scurried around checking, clearing and chatting with guests.  Nice to see!
The salads look amazing as well as the halibut w brown rice.
Can't wait to go back! 
Coastal Living Magazine: you need to see this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I was rather excited to have a \"seafood\" restraunt open in the area that didn't require driving outside my five mile bubble, however I was disappointed by the menu and product.  With that said the interior redesign was done well and captures that cape cod/nantucket feeling.

Back to the food, myself along with my significant other and two other couples went on a Friday night, to my surprise at 7:30pm there was almost no one in the restaurant.  We started with cocktails which were mixed well and had a decent pour.  We opted for the crab dip to start, which had a good portion of crab and I thought was the strongest dish on the menu.  Next we ordered the calamari, lobster rolls and a dozen oysters.  The food was not \"awful I can't eat this\" food, but it was not \"man this is great I can't wait to come back\" either.  The calamari seemed over breaded, the lobster roll didn't have enough lobster to bread ratio and the oysters didn't seem fresh.  I would said the oysters were by far the biggest disappointment.  I must admit I expected to see a raw bar when I walked in, I didn't even realized they did have oysters until someone in our party ordered them.  They were way too brine-y and served oddly on a plate.  

I was expecting the party to leave after drinks and apps, however the group decided to stay for entrees.  Reviewing the entree selection I found nothing to catch my attention and the seafood choices to be limited.  Settling on fish tacos, the fish seemed lost in toppings and served with no sides; however the burger and chicken dishes order by our friends were served with sides.  

Overall the service was good and friendly, I did find it odd that the owner/chef walked thru the dining room and didn't greet any of the five guests spending money in his establishment.  Unfortunately even if they did a menu revamp, I think they lost that initial momentum.  I think had the flavors been more interesting and felt a little more local (yes I am aware that we are not by water - but you can still create this feeling of local-ness) this place would have knocked it out the park as I think Arcadia and Scottsdale have been craving a great seafood restaurant.  However with a competitor opening soon up the street I cannot say I feel the fate of the Yacht Club will be good."}
{"text":"Awesome. Just awesome. If your a seafood/fish lover this is the place to be. Good, solid, classic fare. And at a price that won't make you think twice when you look at the check.  I had the Alaskan Rock Fish flown in fresh that day in the herb and lemon sauce. The two way lobster rolls are where it's at though.  If you like lobster there is no better combo of flavor and texture out there. Fantastic. That said get yourself a bottle of Sancerre and enjoy your trip at sea."}
{"text":"For me, the Yacht Club feels uneven. I think they are still going through the new restaurant 'smoothing out the bumps' process but I have been here often enough now that I feel comfortable rating this place. I might change my mind and update my review later but for now here is where I stand:

We first tried the Yacht Club's food at a networking event about a year before they opened and I immediately really started looking forward to having this delicious new seafood joint in my hood. Fast forward about a year to opening and I was pretty disappointed by my first experience eating in their restaurant. 

Some of the items on their menu have been and continue to be great: I love the lobster roll appetizer (I prefer the simpler lobster and butter version) and I think their calamari is fabulously fresh. 

When it comes to main courses, though, I still haven't found anything that I am in love with. I also find the service to be spotty.

I am looking forward to a time when they are able to get things running smoothly and serve us the amazing dishes I had the first time I tried their food."}
{"text":"yes...I'll give it 4...great decor....I'll agree with a previous post that the bread on the lobster roll is not right....the sweetness takes away from what should be happening and on the beer I'll also  agree and add that maybe 2 or 3 anchor steam beers would be good and on tap with a bit more brew and a little less $"}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best and overpriced at worst! The chef appears to have never been to New England. The small lobster rolls (market priced) tasted like the meat had been precooked or frozen with just a touch of mayo and cold butter. Very dry and chewy.  I wish the food critic for the Arizona Republic had written his review of this joint before  I went here. As an added highlight the manager that night was far more interested in jawing with his pals than checking on food or service. If this restaurant lasts more than a year I will be surprised."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Poorly seated right next to a VERY noisy bar even though the restaurant was half empty and there were several exterior booths available, horribly slow service (again, in a half empty restaurant), food was very mediocre and overpriced.  Would not return, too many other better options in the neighborhood.  Biggest complaint is noise.  Very loud bar with no sound buffers.  We couldn't even carry on a conversation at our table."}
{"text":"Overall food is pretty good.  If only the managers and owners did not think it was acceptable to scream at their employees and use insane profanity in front of the whole restaurant.  Not only does this make for an uncomfortable dining experience, I cannot support a restaurant that allows management to treat their staff so poorly.  Avoid this restaurant and spend your money at a place that is worthy."}
