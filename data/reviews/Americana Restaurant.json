{"text":"This place currently has 4.5 stars out of 12 reviews, which can't be right. There is nothing interesting about this restaurant - they only have the basics & they don't do them well. Maybe their breakfast is good, but the 5 of us went for dinner & everything was bland & dried out. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great southern cooking.  I am sure my father would eat here every night if we let him."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. When I want a good home cooked meal at a good price I come here. The food is great and the service is ALWAYS great! And the hummingbird cake (when it is made) is to die for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant always serves good hot meals every time. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. This is one of the best restaurants in Matthews."}
{"text":"Perfect greasy soon. Friendly fast service and food prices. Nothing earthshaking in food department. Had omelette and cheese burger. It's good classic diner food. Friendly atmosphere , quick, tasty food. Recommend."}
{"text":"They have really good food!! One of my favorite places to go eat when I'm in Matthews. The pulled pork is to die for and so are the apple stixs."}
{"text":"Basic restaurant with great food and low prices. Nothing fancy but definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Feels like home. Mostly regulars but even if you aren't they'll remember you after a few visits. The BEST BREAKFAST special in town $4.70 for coffee, eggs, protein, and potatoes."}
{"text":"Yesterday I met family @ Americana just after noon & the place was busy yet we got seated right away, Sweet tea was flavorful.  The daily special \"country fried steak\" with 2sides: Blacked eyed peas and some of the best fried squash I've ever ate at the affordable price of $7.25!!! Also, the server enlightened me to the difference of \"country style steak\"= cooked in gravy and \"country fried steak\" = breaded fried steak then gravy/mashed potatoes after cooking."}
{"text":"Best breakfast lunch and dinner. Cannot beat the food nor the price. Waitstaff is awesome!! Over the top friendly and attentive. If it's not right they will make it right!!!"}
{"text":"I got a toothpick in my burger that was sideways and hidden inside of it which I could've ended up being hurt by.
The fries were also cold and my boyfriends hard boiled egg was grey and over cooked.
The only good part about this place is the company I brought with me."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant.....not fancy but clean and bright. We ordered the strip steak special with two sides. Steaks were cooked to order. The fried squash was very good. We loved the peanut butter pie! The staff was friendly and attentive. We will be back for dessert for sure and want to give them a try for breakfast."}
{"text":"I must tell yall this place is the sh_t the food is soooo good I could eat here every day lol I kinda do but who's keeping track of that also the best breakfast in town with a thick cut of livermuch and the grits y'all I can tell you how amazing the grits are but the best thing about the place that has me going back is the cornbread muffin.......... cornbread muffins!!! All I can say is get off y'all it's and go down to this places I promise you if you don't like it I'll eat it for you"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast at Americana this morning.  We all had traditional meals.  Good eggs, hash browns, and bacon.  Side of gravy and pancakes."}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time. I used to eat lunch there regularly. Back then it was what it was. Your typical Meat and 2 sides diner. Nothing you'll find in the 'tourism guide'. 

Typical to many others scattered throughout all areas of the city.

But decent food for the $'s, fast service...Nice variety on the menu/daily specials.

I put it in to the same category as Liberty East, The Knife and Fork (gone now) and many others scattered about the city...Medium grade....You wont leave hungry, food is good for the $'s. You'll walk out filled up and content. Good meal for the $'s spent, fast service, which is a must at lunch hour.

you wont walk out saying 'terrific, I'll be telling all my friends'.....You will walk out satisfied with a full belly for the $'s spent..

Havent eaten there for awhile other then for breakfast, which I do a couple times a week. Great $5 breakfast- eggs, grits, hashbrowns or homefries, bacon or sausage or livermush of fried baloney...toast or biscuits....tea or coffee. Nothing great and other diners throughout the city offer something similar.

Americana is at least consistent. However your order your eggs, they are perfect everytime....super fast service....good price....

No complaints. I do put a few diners a step ahead, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner, but Americana is good for what it is. Typical medium grade diner you wont rush out and tell your friends about, but you'll leave satisfied. Fast and friendly service, in and out quickly with a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Looked for a good local place for breakfast and boy did we find it. Outstanding breakfast. Had Livermush for the first time. Really good service, extremely fast turn around food was out in an instant. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Americana have really slipped as of late. We have been eating here for years, but the last several times have been mediocre at best. Tonight I ordered A Philly cheese steak one of my favorite items here, there was barely any meat on it what was is clumped all at the bottom of the roll which was like eating a large crouton dry and hard. My french fries were so undercooked they were floppy greasy mess. The waitress did bring me fresh fries and there were cooked properly. She did, however forget my dad's salad when she brought everyone's to the table he had to wait a while before he got his. We used to go a few times a month now we only go once every few months I don't know what happened but I hope it gets better soon!"}
{"text":"This is a regular breakfast stop for us. Food is always great and the staff is fantastic. For a great breakfast at a great price, this place is the best in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch. The food was average, not a lot of creativity on the menu. The service was good, nothing to complain about. The place was clean. Overall I would come back again."}
{"text":"We had a homeowners meeting here, I had a veggie plate. The fried squash is cut longways not in little wheels..it was a free meal.  My neighbor got grilled chicken and I had a bite. It was juicy and very tasty, not bland at all."}
{"text":"No frills.  No nonsense.  Just good, solid food!  This place has become a regular spot for my wife and me whenever we get in the mood to go out.  

Breakfast is extremely affordable (under $15 for the two of us for an omlette and the breakfast special -- sure beats fast food).  Lunch and dinner are as well, with a wide variety of selections that you are accustomed to seeing at these type of restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and left as full as can be. For the money you can't beat this place. The portions were huge. My fianc√© and I both had coffee and an entree for a whopping $16.00. I had an omelette with hash browns and both were good. We definitely plan on coming back. Come early or you might have to wait as the place was filling up when we left (we got there around 7:15 and sat right down). Wait staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing fried squash. Make sure to order a side of Greek tzatziki sauce. Everything I have eaten here has been good and the sandwiches always have lots of stuff on them not just thin slices."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant in Matthews, staff is very friendly & has personality. Bkfast is best in town & great lunch & dinner. Always a great crowd. You will more than likely run into your friends & neighbors here. Also meals pricing is on point."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good \"home cooking\" around these parts, here is your place. I came in after work on a Friday and the place was packed with the pensioner crowd and a handful of middle agers, but I have no problem with that. I was seated and promptly downed 2 glasses of sweet tea while I browsed the menu. They don't serve alcohol here, but I needed a break from that anyhow. All sorts of things I remember eating as a younger fellow graced the menu and with quite a variety it was hard to choose. I picked out some fried chicken, mac n cheese, amd fries. Everything was cooked to my liking and I think I will go back today after work."}
{"text":"When you want good food at a great price and friendly folks, this is the place for ya. Sarah and I have been coming here for some time now and have never had a bad meal. I just say to the Wife hey you want old folks for dinner that's all it takes. Delicious."}
{"text":"I've given this local restaurant more than one chance. I return due to people I meet with choose this restaurant because of the private area for our  evening meetings . I am consistently disappointed. Not many choices for those who like to eat healthy.  The portions are small probably due to the low prices."}
{"text":"A very charming local restaurant, and the best breakfast you can get outside your own kitchen. The food was very reasonably priced and the staff was cheerful, kind, and attentive. They served the best eggs and the worst biscuits I've ever had, haha! I highly recommend coming here for breakfast (just give the biscuits a miss and get the toast instead!)"}
{"text":"Delicious local diner with real southern breakfast! Red eye gravy and country ham. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Classic Mom and Pop country cooking.  Friendly service with a big menu! Make sure you try the broccoli casserole and fried squash!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for wholesome comfort food. The staff are super friendly. Their portion and prices are a great deal especially lunch."}
{"text":"This is what is commonly called a meat-and-three (as in sides/veggies) place, but unfortunately you only get two. What you do get is decent, and not particularly memorable. The prior incarnation of the restaurant (was it called Americana? I don't recall) wasn't much different, food-wise, but the interior was much different - they have really revamped, and so it looks like it has been updated by at least a few decades, so there is that.

Though you only get two sides, portions are reasonable, and prices aren't horrible either - just may not be quite what you expect when you look at the outside, so definitely peak inside if you go speeding by and think that the brick exterior can't hold much on the inside."}
{"text":"The pork tenderloin tips with peppers and onions was very good. Also the fried squash is the best that I have had. Field peas were flavored perfectly. Did not like the white rice."}
{"text":"I've been going here for two years and I have yet to have a bad meal.  Always friendly service and they have a lot to choose from.  Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"The place was ok. I wasn't too crazy about the vibe. They don't have skim milk which was disappointing.  The food wasn't memorable. The service was good."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this little restaurant when we go to see relatives in Matthews (we're from Atlanta). The service is consistently excellent. Everyone is so warm and friendly. The food is decent. It's your typical meat and veggies. Everything was hot and delicious. It's not the best food but it's definitely a great place to grab a bite and not break the bank. They have a grilled chicken salad that I love. It's got cucumbers, eggs, cheese, etc. They put two big pieces of chicken on top. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"This is a meat-and-three type of restaurant with breakfast offerings, as well.  Always very busy there, but you should be able to find parking on their lot.  Good comfort food, very satisfying.  Friendly staff, clean restaurant.  Many regulars there. Just good Southern-style home cooking."}
{"text":"As other reviews have stated, this is a meat and 3 veggies place - but it's not the food that keeps me coming back.
Yes, the food is good.  The owners are greek, so you know it's good.  They've got some pasta, great lasagne, and plenty of Southern cooking like collard greens and fried okra.  It's all fairly priced and while you won't stuff yourself, you won't leave hungry.
It's the staff that makes it worth it.  Keep going back, and you'll notice the same faces for years.  They're all friendly, and they will start to remember you!
Why 4 out of 5?  Simply because the food is good, but not life changing.  I can name a similar place relatively close that the food is better - but the staff and atmosphere isn't as \"family\"
That's why I keep going back here!"}
{"text":"Entree was good but the dessert made the meal. 
Fast and great service .
Read the reviews and had to try it, it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Had the Mahi Mahi fish with fries and coleslaw special.  A bit overcooked on the fish and small portion of fries and normal portion of coleslaw. Also ordered a side of fried squash which was excellent as usual.

Coleslaw was fine chopped, which is not my preference, but tasted slightly sweet and was crunchy and freshly made.

Fries a bit soggy and shoestring style. Portion good for me, but most people 
would wonder why skimp on the fries. 

Great service, as usual. Great prices. Just fell a little short on the food today :-("}
{"text":"I drove past this place for a year, not even knowing what this place was. And we have been a couple of times now and I was pleasantly surprised to find a great American diner right around the corner. Nothing beats the Americana for breakfast; cheap, delicious, and fast. It is becoming a Saturday morning tradition for me. Love their omelette and hash browns, and I also appreciate the honoring of our armed forces in the waiting area. Top shelf Americana."}
{"text":"First time here, family friendly restaurant. Good service, reasonably priced food. Had the burger,  it was pretty flavorful, others in the party had the turkey sandwich and a steak sandwich. Steak was a little fatty, but not bad. Will be back to see how breakfast is."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte.  Blueberry pancakes are packed.   Pork chop breakfast is very generous and seasoned perfectly.  Staff is efficient and very friendly. You will feel apreciated and leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Simple diner that never lets you down. The fried squash, Mac n cheese, yams, and cabbage are by far the best sides on the menu. This restaurant is my reason for driving to Matthews."}
