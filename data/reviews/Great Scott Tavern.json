{"text":"Very cool renovated space.  Innovative menu.  Great service.  Owners & management on-site and on the floor."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. It's the perfect place to go to if you want your lunch to take an hour and twenty minutes to arrive at the table. After you hungrily devour your tasteless sandwich and wet, overdressed salad you can enjoy the ambiance while you wait 20 minutes for your check. The bathrooms are nice. You get to visit them at least twice while you think up an excuse to tell your boss for why you're getting back from lunch at 2pm."}
{"text":"Had a very favorable experience at the Great Scott Tavern this evening for dinner. We were greated immediately and seated quickly by a very friendly hostess. Our waiter, Mark, came to our table asking for our drink order, reviewing the specials, and soon after delivering warm rolls. Enjoyed a generous Negroni and placed our order. After a very short wait our delicious entrees arrived. The buttermilk fried chicken was crisp and excellent as were the accompanying sides. The barbecued ribs were perfectly done and the sauce was very tasty. The restaurant is fairly large and well appointed. The meal was fairly priced and a good value. I would definitely  recommend this restaurant and plan to return soon."}
{"text":"I would prefer my grade school cafeteria staff instead of the goof troop crew they have on payroll. Good entrees and good drinks though. Desserts need some work."}
{"text":"After keeping on eye on the renovation of this space, we were anxious to try Great Scott Eatery!  The space is large but we were disappointed that the dining room didn't have more character after all the work they put into it  (The 4 vs 5 star rating).  The FOOD...........OMG was it good!.  Husband and I both had the double bone in pork chop and it was perfect.  We both tend to shy away from meat but this menu is really geared towards meat lovers.  It would be nice to find more sea food options."}
{"text":"This was our second time here...25 minutes in, no orders were taken and the only drinks were the sodas.  When we left I told the hostess, as we waited for our car another man came out and said I'm sorry.  This is a shame because the first time we were here the service and food was wonderful.  Was so looking forward to trying much more on the menu."}
{"text":"Could not get into Beach Club bistro next door, so thought we would try Great Scott, although we new nothing about it except valet parking traffic. Nice clean family atmosphere with a fireplace. Not a gormet restaurant, but meatloaf was very good good, with real mashed potatoes and perfectly done asparagus. Large burger was tasty although a little overcooked, and fresh French fries were cooked in duck fat, for a very nice touch. Prices were very reasonable, and cocktails well made. Also a large beer menu."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a minus 10 stars I would. Service was terrible. My husband and I were seated right away, but did not get serviced or even acknowledged after being seated 25 minutes. 2 other tables were seated after us, there drink orders were taken and served, bread served, and main orders taken, all while we sip on our now empty glasses of water, trying to make eye contact for some type of attention from the walkers, not waiters, because thats all they did was walk past our table. So needless to say we left but not before expressing our disdain for our treatment, but guess what? They didn't GAF. The hostess said sorry, but her body language was more like WGAF! So this place can KMA!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I joined friends at the bar for Happy Hour one week ago. The bartender mistakenly ran someone else's tab on my credit card. This SHOULD be an easy fix, just void the mistaken charge, right? Well that would make too much sense. The bartender explained the problem and that they will work on processing the credit. Huh?  I paid my correct tab and left. Three, four, seven days go by and still no credit. Why is this so difficult? I made several phone calls and TRIED to talk the manager and I was told the manager was out, or to call back at another time but still no resolution. 

The food was ok but the lack of service was horrible! There are several much better options in the neighborhood which have good food and much better service.  Next time I'll go to Beach Club Pizza Bistro, The Standard or Paragon and just drive past NOT Great Scott Tavern."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to frequent Great Scott Tavern b/c it's so close to home but the last time we went my food had to be sent back b/c it tasted like dish soap, and our waitress was not very friendly.  She didn't come back to check on us and we brought our family with us during this visit for an anniversary dinner, then they gave us some expired coupons which we didn't notice b/c who would notice that and then didn't honor them when we came back, and certainly this is not about money it's about doing the right thing and servicing the customer.  My husband and I are professionals so that is the way we think, if something is within our power to fix it then we just do it.  Great Scott should know people will always remember a bad experience and and how you made the customer feel, then tell all their friends about it.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go almost weekly after discovering this gem! Staff is always friendly, great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots...the food was off the hook and portions are huge...had a couple drinks to start off..followed by calamari  cooked to perfection,followed by a blt wedge salad  enough for 3 people...and as my main dish ,had their famous meatloaf  ...it was sooooo good i ate it all ..feeling so uncomfortable  from stuffing my self 
,but so worth it if you havent tried this place its a hidden gem...you cant go wrong ...the best ! and the rest manager was nothing less then the yperfect host..will be back and gonna tell everyone i know to try this place out. You wont go wrong   say hello to thom  his smile and charm will win you over. Thanks thom"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue but I want to give a HUGE THANK YOU to the entire staff at Great Scott Tavern! They helped make a very special day unforgettable. My husband became disabled one year ago and on the anniversary of I wanted to surprise him with the trauma nurse and physical therapist that first helped him when he was in the hospital and have contributed to his remarkable recovery as he has recently started to learn to walk again as they were there the day the Trauma Dr. told him they would never walk again. 

The staff assisted me in reserving a perfect table, and helped me in situating the surprise guests before I arrived with my husband to surprise him. The waitress, who was incredible, came over after we surprised him to let us know on behalf of Great Scott Tavern they wanted to comp us for most of our meal because they were so moved by our story. This made it an even more epic and memorable evening than we could have expected. 

I'd like to also note that their facility is amazingly wheelchair accessible which gives my husband peace of mind knowing he won't have any obstacles doing something as simple as going out to dinner. 

Thank you Great Scott Tavern for your generosity and support in helping make this a remarkably beautiful day we will never forget. We are so grateful!"}
{"text":"I use to delivery news papers to this location when it was Century 21 Real estate, and was excited to see it turned into a large restaurant.  I visited it on one of my trips back to Cleveland (i live by NYC now), and was impressed with what they did with the place.  There's a lot of promise here, and I can't wait to come back again with the hope of them continuing to adapt the menu and service.  

My visit here was very down and up.  I sat at the bar on a weeknight, and the service very slow at first.  It took about ten minutes for the bartender to recognize me as  a customer, to which he asked \"what can I get you?\"  I asked for his name, and he responded with Greg.  He shook my hand and I then asked for a menu.  

Greg seemed to lack a little confidence, and it was apparent that he was not very experienced behind the bar and that he was over tasked.  When I asked him about the great selection of beers, he had very little knowledge about them.  I was a little surprised that he was not trained on them, and would recommend the management bring in a beer Cicerone to help teach the servers and bartenders about their great selection and how to pair them with meals.  

Greg was also running between the bar and the tables outside, which added to my frustration and timing to being noticed when I first sat down.  He also had to wash all of the glasses from the packed bar when there was a group of dishwashers visible in the back standing idle.  I asked him about the washing of the dishes by hand, and he explained that the bar dishwasher wasn't working properly.  The management should have recognized this and lightened his work load. 

The menu is very small for such a large place, but Greg explained that they are looking to expand it as they continue working out the kinks.   I really hope that this happens, and will look forward to seeing a revised menu when i come back.  I ordered some Honey Ghost Wings and enjoyed a few beers while I watched the tribe play.  The wings were excellent, and I would highly recommend them.  

I had good conversation with Greg as I enjoyed my food and drink, and he seems like a good kid,  As the night progressed and settled down, he made me feel welcomed.  He just needs a little help with some training and experience to build his confidence.  I didn't meet any of the other staff, but being a newer place, I assume that there are similar challenges with the staff that the management should help them with.      

I can't wait to come back in December to see what's changed!"}
{"text":"The food and service are lacking. My filet was underdone after the first one had garlic on it. (I am allergic and told at the beginning of the meal)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been her a couple times. Both times the wait staff were phenomenal and the food excellent! We started off with the mussels and frites for our appetizer that were sooooo good!  Loved the specials tonight. They had a gulf shrimp dish with lemon/oil over noodles that was fantastic! We also ordered the walnut (or pecan) crusted trout...mmmm. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink menus. Quick and friendly service. Comfortably renovated space. Everything a good neighborhood restaurant should be. Definitely looking forward to coming back and exploring what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Changed their happy hour. 
Only till 6pm instead of 7.
\"All day\" happy hour on Tuesday and Weds-
Guess that's good for the unemployed or retired!"}
{"text":"It is a nice building, but very loud in the dining room. (we thought people in the kitchen were arguing but I guess it was just people in the bar). The fried provolone wheel was very delicious, everything else was just OK. I got the pork schnitzel (which was actually a well-done chop) and my husband got the \"Old World\" which ended up being keilbasa and mashed potatoes (supposed to be perogis).  I only gave 3 stars because everything was just OK, not great -- even the server, she was nice enough when she came by, but spent most of the time talking to her co-worker."}
{"text":"We had a great time celebrating a family member's birthday last night.  The food was delicious, the drinks were fun, and our server was fantastic!  Will be back again shortly!"}
{"text":"We recently dined here as a part of a large group. The personnel here are all very polite, personable, and professional, especially our server, Marcus.  The decor is nice, and is appropriate for the locale, history and genre.

I had issues with the kitchen, however. First, one half of our long table received their food several minutes before the other, facing half. Watching our food grow cold, while our companions urged us to go ahead and eat was not how we had planned that our dinner out should go. I ordered two appetizers for my meal - the mushroom polenta and the crab cakes.  The polenta was delicious, but the mushrooms were much too salty. Another in our group had the same complaint.

The rest of our party enjoyed their meals and were well-attended by the staff."}
{"text":"Started at the bar and had the choice from a rather large beer selection for the area. Had a happy hour special with $1 of drafts and on a Monday, $3 craft bottles. Really happy with the selection of beer and the bar was beautiful with a window into the kitchen. 

Later sat in the dining room- the decor was really rustic and chic at the same time with cool light fixtures and comfortable booths along the wall. 
Started with the peach sangria, which was really refreshing, and the mussels and frites, which was really well sized and- with the aioli - so good. 
Have to mention the complimentary bread and basil with olive oil dipping plate it comes with because it was different in really good way- a super good alternative to butter especially in the summer. 

I had the Mac and cheese with a crab cake and the crab cake was deliciously crunchy and creamy with the Mac and cheese- almost wished I had the crab cakes alone because it was so good. 
The rest of my party was very satisfied with their entrees especially the meatloaf and the Scott Burger which offered a classic burger with a bacon-y flavor, but better. 
We couldn't decide if the French fries were so good because of the duck fat or if they were just really good fries and once again- the aioli was a party favorite. 

Finished our meals off with the butter pecan cheesecake which was gone before we knew it.
Overall, I thought the food and service was excellent and will definitely be returning to this new Euclid gem!"}
{"text":"We came in to check out the entertainment and ended up having a meal. I had the mussels and frites. Outstanding!! My Old Fashioned was very good"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of food options when you're living in Collinwood, so we decided to give this place in Euclid a shot. The decor is odd, almost like a diner, the food was mediocre, and the draft list was small. That being said, I'd give this place another try and order something different. The duck fat frites were good."}
{"text":"Last night I had the most delicious and beautiful cut of salmon, perfectly cooked and placed atop a lovely salad. This was a nice meaty thick fresh salmon with the skin on (not those little previously frozen pre-portioned things you get at some places) It was perfect!  I have found other fish to be of high quality. They must have a very nice purveyor where they get fresh fish in."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere.  Terrible food.  It was freezing cold in the restaurant.  We waited an hour for soup that was cold.  Had a BLT with a piece of tomato that was the size of a quarter. 
Other people were being served before us that came in later than we did.  Awful lunch.  Will not be back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened in Euclid! Where do I begin...went there during Browns game and sat at the bar,nice bar area,the batender was very friendly. They have an open kitchen,so while sitting at the bar you can watch the chefs at work. That day they had $3 tall Blue Moon during Browns game. We ordered mussels & frites and crab cakes. Both were delicious. Tasted extremely fresh. It was a huge portion of mussels,fries and bread for dipping into the butter wine sauce. As far as what can be improved,they advertised Browns game specials on FB but when we got there the game wasnt on. Once they put the game on you could barely hear it. And they are not open for lunch. They dont open til 4. Other than that I will definitely be back!! Look forward to sitting in dining room or on outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Nice open new restaurant/bar and welcome addition to downtown Euclid. Interesting menu, quick efficient service. Do not like the valet parking, reminds me of why I don't go to Willoughby."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Great Scott Tavern and left extremely disappointed. We went there tonight to celebrate my birthday.  The service was subpar even though there was no crowd. The guests at the next booth arrived after we did and were served bread. We had to ask for bread after noticing the other booth receiving their bread. I asked my server for a refill on my beverage and waited for a long time until I ended up asking another server for a refill. 

My husband told them it was my birthday when he made the reservation and reminded the hostess when we arrived. We never got the dessert with a candle he was told we would get. After waiting for what seemed like an exceptionally long time following the plates being cleared we eventually just asked for the check and waited a long time for that.  I guess we could have asked for the dessert with the candle after that but I just wanted to leave at that point. 

The beef stroganoff was not flavorful. I had to ask for salt and pepper.  The mussels did not have much flavor either although the fries were very good. 

I do not recommend Great Scott for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  We had a fantastic dinner here on a Thursday night.  We were early and the place was fairly empty so we were seated immediately at a booth.  A young man appeared right away with bread for the table.  Very shortly afterward, our waitress set down two glasses of water, welcomed us to the restaurant and asked for our drink orders.  She gave us time to review the menus.  There are lots of well-priced offerings from sandwiches to steaks to seafood.  I choose the turkey, bacon avocado wrap with rosemary frites.  Delicious!  And a huge portion!  I saved half the wrap for another meal.  (I ate all the fries because they were just too good not to!)  My husband ordered the cabbage rolls, mashed potatoes and veggie and said it was very good!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but not too attentive.  It bothers me when servers hover too much, as they tend to do when it's not busy.  We are always looking for a good happy hour and we took a peek at their happy hour menu which looks great!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place...food was great..the deserts were great..must stop.

Chef Mike is great addition."}
{"text":"Love that this restaurant is in Euclid. It brings more people and revenue into this great town. The modern bar and dining area are very nice. I would love to see the bar area extended or an additional bar added to the large dining area. Great place to watch cavs, Indians, or browns. Prices are a little high but the overall experience is nice."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience in this new restaurant . I had the Pork Tenderloin which was perfectly seared and tender, along with an app of fries which were cooked in duck fat. Delicious!!! The waiter (Andre?) took great care of us and had a professional and positive attitude, and was very knowledgable on the menu. The selection of beer was pretty good as well, with outstanding happy hours prices. I really hope to see this restaurant do well in the future. They are definitely headed in the right direction with excellent cooking and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here. First time diners there I didn't know what to expect. Their steaks were amazing, you almost don't need a steak knife. 
The interior of the restaurant is a little more plain than I expected but it's still very nice."}
{"text":"This is a good solid restaurant that most clearly defined by their building. This was a former US Post Office. The room is a no-nonsense rectangle. The bar is off to the side. All of that could lead one to believe that the food is likewise plain.

The difference in the building is the subtle Art Deco style. The difference in the food is the creative approach and the skilled preparation. Like the building, the core is simple. Steaks, Chicken, Meatloaf, Salmon. By themselves these could be boring, but not in the hands of the talented staff. The Chicken Confit was a neat version of the popular Duck dish. The Meatloaf is set on a creamy bed of mashed potato and topped with tomato and cheese. Who puts fries in a bowl of mussels? Great Scott does!

This is a wonderful addition to the Euclid dining scene. Go there to see a very nice historic rehab and taste some excellent versions of kitchen staples."}
{"text":"Overall, probably a 3.5.  The food was a 4, but the overall experience was just a bit awkward. This place has been on my bucket list of places to try.  My good friend and I decided to celebrate my birthday here.  We dined here on a weeknight, after work and therefore arrived separately.  She arrived first, when I arrived, I mention to the hostess that I was meeting someone.  The hostess replied that she hadn't seated anyone, and that maybe I should check the bar.  I did, to no avail.  I proceed to call my friend, she answers and states that she is in the restaurant.  I find her and sit down.  The hostess rushes over and asks my friend, \"did I seat you, I couldn't have, Bob must have seated you\"  My friend states that the person standing in front of us had indeed seated her, just a few minutes before I arrived.  The restaurant was practically empty, so not sure how she couldn't remember (I have my own theory, which I will keep to myself).  As we reviewed the menu, we were approached by our server, Christina, and gave her our drink order, Sangria and Moscow Mule.  Both were tasty!  Christina returned, delivered bread (which was homemade, at some point, but was a bit, dry and hard. The chili dipping oil was nothing to write home about either.  Plain butter or olive oil would have been sufficient), recited the daily specials and proceeded to take our order.  We decided on the Mr. & Mrs. Porterhouse Steak entree accompanied by Dauphonois Potatoes and Asparagus, which we subbed with brussel sprouts.  We also added mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Our food arrived a short time later on a large platter, presented by a runner.  We asked for extra plates to divide the food between us.  He seemed a bit confused, returning with a saucer, then 1 dinner plate, then finally 2 dinner plates.  We proceeded to dig in.  The steak was huge, seasoned well and very tender.  Cooked perfectly, medium, as requested.  The potatoes were thinly sliced and layered in a cream sauce, baked as a casserole and then portioned accordingly for serving.  The brussel sprouts were deep fried, with some other ingredient, not quite sure what the ingredient was, but the remains left a reddish puddle on the plate and had a bit of a chalky type taste.  Not bad, but could have done without the extra ingredient.  Our server checks on us (along with the manager and owner) throughout the meal, and then returns to offer us the check.  My friend is noticeable irritated, and whispers to the server, that she had called ahead and stated that she wanted to surprise me with dessert, after our meal.  The server didn't know and was extremely apologetic.  The information had not been passed along to her.  Christina returns with the dessert, a white chocolate cheesecake, which we were going to share.  She takes a bite, and then I take a bite and we both have the same reaction, waxy and not fresh tasting.  The server returns and I mention that the cheesecake couldn't possible be fresh, due to the waxy taste and the maciated looking strawberries on top.  She once again was very apologetic and asked if there was anything else we wanted instead.  At this point my friend is even more irritated because the table behind us is also celebrating a birthday and their dessert is delivered with lots of fanfare and a candle (whomp, whomp).  The owner approaches our table and adamantly states that the pastry chef had made the referenced dessert that morning (I beg to differ) and that the kitchen staff tasted it and said it tasted fresh.  The hostess then approaches our table and questions my friend as to who she spoke with, when she made the reservation and birthday dessert request and curtly responds \"it could not have been me you talked to, because I don't get in until 4\"  This is also the same person that hadn't remembered seating her, just a few moments before I arrived, it was so unnecessary and so uncalled for.  We enjoyed our meal and our server was awesome, but the rest, left us underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I've always heard of Great Scott Tavern on the radio and it was time to try it out! Huge portions and great service! Our server was extremely friendly and I am glad I had a chance to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! 

First of all, the food was all amazing! We got the mussels, meatloaf, salmon, chicken, and chicken confit. All amazing! The mussels were tender and in an excellent broth with fries on top. The meatloaf was tender and had great flavor with some perfectly cooked green beans and mashed potatoes. The stroganoff was very tender and had a creamy sauce. The chicken was crispy, and the salmon dish was a wonderful combination of flavors. 

Our server, Loretta, was also very friendly. We don't get to come back to Ohio often, but this place will now be on our must go to list for when we do!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Food is excellent. A bit pricey and not much selection. But what they do have is very good. Staff are friendly.  Good bar."}
{"text":"Everything about Great Scott was above and beyond my expectations. I pulled into the parking lot and was surprised to see free valet parking. The area is pretty condensed anyway, but it was a very nice touch. Walking in, I was greeted immediately by a friendly hostess and was promptly seating. Inside, this place is huge; the bar to the right, a large lounge area in the middle, and ample dinner room seating to the left. After being seated, it wasn't 2 minutes before me and my party were attended to and ordering drinks. The beer selection was average, with a few specialty beers mixed in. Our waiter, Sean, was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, which was impressive to me since they just opened. The menu was relatively small, but there was something for everyone. I ordered the signature burger and my party ordered the steak, the stroganoff, and the mac and cheese (note: this is NOT a side dish, the bowl is huge!). The burger came with a side of duck fat fries, which caused me to question why I had settled for regular fries all these years. After sampling a bit of everything my party had ordered, I have to say the food was superb. Everything was well seasoned, cooked to perfection, and extremely flavorful. I initially thought the prices were a little high, but it was justified as soon as the food was tasted. My party and I left satisfied and with leftovers for lunch the next day. This is a great upper class restaurant without being too pretentious. The perfect place for a date or just hanging out with friends after catching a movie at the Lakeshore 7. A place where you feel as comfortable wearing a polo as you would a suit and tie. I can't wait to come back and experience more of the menu! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing dinner and drinks last night at Great Scott Tavern. Here are a few things to note:
1) it's brand new and with the unexpected closing of one of my fave places in that area (Grovewood Tavern) this helps fill the void for good affordable food
2) that said, we went for happy hour but there was no real gem there on discounted drinks or apps (there were a few beer specials but I'm not much of a beer drinker)
3) you must try the peach sangria. It's light and a little potent. Perfect for the summer.
4) the bread basket comes with a green chili and olive oil dip. Delicious.
5) my entree was the meatloaf topped with green beans and a think chopped tomato sauce. So so good. I ate every last bite!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I'm looking for food on the east side, as I found myself doing yesterday. I took the chance to try Great Scott Tavern after hearing so much about it on 92.3 on a daily basis. You can tell a lot about a place by how good the rolls are when you first sit down. It did not disappoint. The lobster bisque? Freaking amazing. Stuffed cabbages? Excellent. My girlfriend got the veggie burger and she loved it. Good selection of domestic and craft beers. I will return when I get the chance."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. My steak was way over cooked the first time, then practically raw the next two times. I chose to get the wedge salad instead and it was also bad. I will never come here again. Overpriced and bad quality."}
{"text":"I hate that I have to write about this place, it truly is the gem in the heart of Euclid. I Love love love this place and I don't want anyone else to go except me! I do want them to make money so they can stay open of course, so I must go on and write this review. 

I went there as a part of my birthday celebration, I didn't have anything too fancy just the Calamari and a Peach? Sangria. I was pretty good, there was nothing to complain about although I didn't like the homemade marinara? sauce too much. The staff was friendly and polite, and the decor was nice. I didn't expect it to be so nice on the inside, especially the bar. 

The second time I went there (the following week), I loved it just as much if not better. Our waiter/bartender Kevin was very nice and personable. This time I had the mussels? and french fries which were really good!

I'm going there again this week, and hopefully, ?it will? be just as good, if not better. I'm really excited? to make this place my usual hang out spot."}
{"text":"First time to Great Scott.  Clean, comfortable and well appointed atmosphere.  All staff were welcoming and engaging.  We were checked upon numerous times, appropriately so. The menu was definitely notches above bar food, but not pretentious.  Husband had the special of salmon stuffed with crab.  Delicious!  I had the wings w side salad.  Perfect!  Best server we have encountered in a very long time.  Chris S was the best server!  Highest compliments to her!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for The Thanksgiving Buffet and was very impressed by the restaurant. The buffet for thanksgiving had all the basic thanksgiving fixings such as Macaroni & Cheese, Sweet Potatoes, Green Beans, Mashed Potatoes, Turkey, Ham , Stuffing, Salads and an assortment of desert pies etc. The food was very succulent and delicious, the experience at this joint was grand and I definitely will be back. The Bloody Mary's are also great."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised buy Great Scott Tavern. Road up to meet some friends thinking we were going to just hang and listen to a band. The menu was traditional American food and the prices were very reasonable. Sitting on the patio watching the cars drive by reminded me of days in high school. Hanging out and enjoying life."}
{"text":"This place has great high quality food, plain and simple. This is why I keep coming back. The stuffed mushrooms are perfect. The crab cakes are wonderfully full of crab."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was served quicker than some fast food chains. I gave a three star rating only because I was underwhelmed by the perch dinner that I ordered. My drink (Old Fashion) and the chocolate cake were good though. Because of the service, I will certainly give them another chance. Next time, I will order something different, and I will happily raise the rating if it's better than the perch."}
{"text":"Keep it short and sweet..

Atmosphere was amazing.. quiet and the restaurant itself looks so unique and special.

Menu was perfect.. simply described choices with lots of options to choose from.

Our food.. best hamburger I've ever had.. and I've had a lot of them.  The wife's meatloaf was... in her words... the best she has ever had.  The duck fat fries were perfectly cooked and tasted so good I almost made myself sick cause I couldn't stop picking at them.

Best part though by far was Tom, our server.  He was prompt, polite, answered each and every question we had, and explained everything in such detail that by the time he was done the entire menu sounded amazing.. we wanted to have it all and will be coming back to try more.  

For this area, you can't find a better place that isn't a chain restaurant... it's obvious the chef takes pride in his craft and that the staff enjoys what they do.  Check this place out if you want some amazing food cooked with love.  Boom!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere! That's a 5 star. Valet parking, free added bonus!
Menu selection great choices. 
Excellent that the executive chef came to meet the table.

Now the pricing for 2 very small crab cakes was a bit high, however they were good. But not worth $12. 
The Bourbon drink with cucumber was amazing. 
Chicken paprikash was a 7 out of 10. Needed far less sauce and more chicken and spaetzle.( or as people say dumplings?) nevertheless, sauce was good, just a ton of it.
Service was SLOW! But may just be because our party was larger than the norm. Or maybe because of a backup in the kitchen, but it was slow. 
Checks came and there were issues with two of the checks for the table. Which again, it happens with large parties. 
 
Would I personally come back, eh, maybe."}
{"text":"The service is so bad the best food in the world could not make up for it.  I have sent messages several times with no response.  It's as if the staff and managers are trying to sabotage the place.  My last and final visit, I finally got my drink, after asking repeatedly for it, when I was done with my dinner AND they forgot to put the vodka in it!  Do you think they comped the drink?  No.  That was my fifth and last visit.  Such a disappointment after waiting for years for a good restaurant in their area.  The neighborhood is very disappointed.  Hopefully, the owner will see this review because I  don't think the complaints are getting to her."}
{"text":"After going next door at beach club and getting poor service tried this place again.   In the past this pace had spotty service but those  eve was wonderful.   The turkey sandwich was huge and tasted soooooo good.  The swordfish was perfectly prepared.  The service staff tried their best and were pleasant.   With that said the service at times can uneven.   If you have not eaten here, give it a try.  If you tried it in the past and were disappointed try them again"}
{"text":"I grew up in Euclid so when I saw this nice looking restaurant open in my home town I thought I would go and support it.  Great Scott Tavern was just average IMO.  The service was not that great and the food was very average.  The green salad was a huge plate of spring mix with a few cherry tomatoes cut in half and some cheese sprinkled on.  Nothing special.  My diver scallops tasted great and were cooked perfectly but holy crap there were 4 of them and and three were the size of a quarter and one was decent sized.  I wasn't sure if this was an appetizer or a main 'til I got the $25 charge.  The Mac-n-cheese the table had was good.  The bread that came for the table was just ok but we had to ask for it rather than it coming with the salads.   What really looked nice was the bar area.  That would be a cool place to hangout.  I live about 50 min away so I'd never go back for that dinner experience."}
{"text":"Great local Resturant.  Try the frites.  They have a revolving specials on the menu which are all very good.  In one area they have a full bar that you can watch them cook your food on an open wood flame.  Very good food relaxing atmosphere.  So if you are stressed and need good food with the ability to have adult beverages stop here."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a coupon from the Entertainment book.    The food was excellent.   Many people would think there aren't a ton of choices, but I think there was enough.    The service was excellent, our waitress was funny, quick, and friendly.    There was someone playing jazz on the piano which was nice as well.    It seems they do events, which I want to check out on day.   As I said the food was great.   I had the meatloaf and my husband had a fish special.    The inside was industrial, and really cool (I like exposed ceilings).    Definitely a good find close to home!"}
{"text":"Loved it both times we went. We had amazing food and great atmosphere.  I can not wait to go again.  No problem parking and food is reasonably priced. It is almost a steal for the quality of good food.  Really great service! The mussels appetizers is more than worth the money. Don't skip the frites!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a work get together and had a great time! What a great restaurant/bar. I love how the restaurant and bar are basically two different entities. You can come for a nice sit down dinner or stop into the bar for a great handmade cocktail and watch the game!!! The menu is great and usually changes every couple months. Such a great local place which is also locally owned. Cant wait to stop in again!!!"}
{"text":"Great stuff here in a rather nondescript strip center in Euclid. Kitchen can be slow if crowded but the food is great."}
{"text":"Very awesome place!  At first I had my doubts and thought I wouldn't like anything here...boy was I wrong!  Nice atmosphere...as soon as I went to the bar area, I was greeted by my server/bartender Stephanie (who is super cool by the way). She was friendly, engaging and attentive in a non annoying way. Specials of the day aren't posted anywhere, it is verbally told to you. Decided to try one of the specials, Beef Brisket Potato Skins (not on the menu). Very tender and good, hope it goes on the menu. Also decided to try the wings, Stephanie warned me about the Honey Ghost flavor (very very hot) but when I tried it...in my opinion, not that hot at all.  Everyone was super friendly...on my way out, I ran into the manager and he introduced himself.  Very nice and approachable guy, I think he said his name was Joe (don't be mad, I am bad with names).  Would definitely come back...really want to try the mussels and frites. The only small little gripe is that I hope they expand the menu...have more choices but other than that...very relaxing and nice place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I met some friends there last night.  They were there before me, in that time they had ordered food and drinks.  When I arrived, it took 10 minutes before the server came and checked on me, when I did order a beer, it took 10 more minutes before I received the drink (there was maybe 10 tables with people in the establishment)  Shortly there after, a friend ordered a drink, which they were now out of, and was then told the beer she ordered could only be served tall, not short.  A draft beer.  One size only?!?!
My friends were somewhat pleased with there entrees.  They said the food was \"okay\"
To sum up my description of the evening, it was like being in \"The Twilight Zone\". The employees all seem confused, dazed, and shouldn't be working in customer service.  So strange, I do not plan on returning."}
