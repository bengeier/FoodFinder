{"text":"Have been in to Sharky's a handful of times for beer and wings. The wings are huge and always fresh! THey have 125 flavours and everyone I've tried has been delicious. If you like spicy definitely check their selection out. The service is great, owner is very friendly and challenged us to a hot wing contest and gave us over $100 worth of free food and beer. Very neighbourhood pub feel, definitely take a chance and check out Sharky's."}
{"text":"I went here a few times when it was Wild Wing. They still have giant wings menu minus the franchise. I had a hankering for a burger and decided to have the Sharkies Burger with fries. It was delicious! The burger itself seemed handmade and came with lots of fresh fixings. The fries were plentiful and I couldn't finish them all.

While speaking with the bartender and watching some football on the TV I mentioned that I hadn't gone to a Stampeders game in a while and liked watching CFL games. The next thing I knew he was handing me tickets to a game on the weekend!

Thanks for the great service, the delicous burger and the fantastic football game (which the Stamps won)!"}
{"text":"I avoided this place like the plague when it was Wild Wing, but now that it is called Sharky's, it just oozes ambiance and class.

And a place that sells wings and plays sports with deeply polished mahogany.
Well, not mahogany, but I am no arborist, I just like to drink beer.

The bartender was really friendly, he switched the sound on the TVs from the baseball to the football game, which made the fiance really happy. He made me a really spicy, delicious ceaser. Don't order wine here though. I think there is probably one person out of 50 who order wine and that means that bottle of red has been sitting open for awhile. Just don't do it. My friend choked it down without sending it back cause she is too nice.
Nice selection of beers on tap including Big Rock, Wildrose and Village.

I really enjoyed the food here too, will come back for wings cause there are seriously 8 million flavours, including hot chocolate. 

SEXUAL CHOCOLATE.
