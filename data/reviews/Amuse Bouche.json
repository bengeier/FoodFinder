{"text":"Three of us recently went for dinner and I thought it was great.  Small restaurant so I do suggest reservations.  It is also BYOB which makes it fun.  We started with the Hummus, Burrata, and Kale salad.  The hummus had great flavor and the kale salad was delicious.  You should skip the burrata.  For entrees we had the Black Cod on a bed of asian noodles.  Cooked perfect and the peanut sauce on the noodles was a nice pairing.  Duck breast was also spot on with the dried fruit chutney.  Hanger steak was good.  We finished with the bread pudding...some of the best I have ever had.  Creme brulee-as it should be-nice sugar shell, good consistency and great vanilla flavor.  Our third dessert was the chocolate panna cotta.  My least favorite was the chocolate.  I know by reading the many other reviews lots of people love it.  I think the bread pudding and creme brulee were far superior.    Overall I think this is a gem for the west-side.  I think the reviews about slow service and not being kid-friendly are way off.  There are plenty of restaurants that cater to families.  This restaurant serves great food that shouldn't comprise their standards.  To only give this restaurant 3 stars because they don't serve grilled cheese is ridiculous.  If you are in the area I highly suggest you eat here, but don't forget to bring wine."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice and all dishes were prepared  as good as they get. We have had home made soups,mussels, fish and chips and the steak. The service was friendly and the atmosphere  was that of a small neighborhood restaurant. It started as just a catering business but customers suggested they serve meals. First was just one meal a day ,now it is all three except Sunday it is closed. This is the first meals we have had in Surprise where we found the food to be this good . We hope that in the future improvements are made in the atmosphere as Some French decore and music would enlighten the experience. We can take our own wine there and corkage is only $2 per person."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place. What was I thinking?!!' I've been missing out! I had the quiche Lorraine which was excellent, my boyfriend had the Cuban panini which was sooo yummy. They also had a corn green chile soup that was to die for. Everything was amazing, a true little gem in surprise for sure! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch- small menu but everything is done very well.  Sometimes you have to wait a bit, even with a reservation.  It is small and quite crowded so be prepared to be packed in like a sardine.  Despite that- I consider myself lucky because the food is so delicious!  Eggs benedict is amazing.  BYO champagne for mimosas."}
{"text":"Brunch.  Dinner Service  If I could afford to, I would eat here every night. Spot on for recipes, delicious coffee, accurate descriptions On menu. Surprise is lucky to have this place."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Both chefs are French Culinary Institute of Paris graduates who own this quaint, BYOB, no corking charge only a $2.00 glass fee !  The food is Nouveau French and bar none the best in town!  The prices are moderate and we always save room for the chocolate tart dessert.  We go there often and always meet very interesting people from all over town and most times end up sharing the wines we bring with each other .  You will be glad you dined there I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for microwave food. I was looking forward to this place as I've heard great things. Unfortunately I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Gourmet quality food in a little strip mall setting.  Not a lot of tables, and they are usually filled!  Pricey, but worth it.  Probably among the Top 3 restaurants within 50 miles. Compares with the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is an amazing breakfast spot. It's constantly packed and for good reason. Come here as soon as you can. I would even call and make a reservation just incase."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Amuse was great.  We had the most amazing dinner and our waiter was fantastic.  Our second experience, however, was very unpleasant.  We took some of our friends who are from out of town, but just recently bought a second home here.  The food was not as good and the service was horrific.  The waitress even had the nerve to say that  she and the staff were betting in the kitchen on who was going to eat the bread at our table.  She said that our friends were more fit than my husband and I because we ate the bread and they didn't??  Well, our friend just lost 30 pounds because he just had heart surgery and our other friend just doesn't eat that much -- very tiny lucky gal.  I could not believe how rude and insulting the waitress was though.  We will not be going back!  So disappointed.  I thought this would be our new place, but the inconsistency is a real turn off."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and love this place!  You can't beat the quiche, but the meatloaf is great, too.  I am picky about my meatloaf and theirs is delicious.  Of course the desserts are to die:)  We mostly go for lunch and brunch.  They raise the prices at dinner time and the selection is limited, but it's all good!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets.  The paninis are excellent with rich flaovors and ravishing ingredients.  You can definitely tell the difference with taste and food quality from a chef.  The restaurant has a nice pleasant atmosphere.  What a gem in Surprise.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Always excellent food. I have not had anything I did not enjoy. The Cabernet burger is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amuse Bouche - a hidden bistro gem in the land of chain restaurants!    Every time I visit, there is something delicious and unique on the menu.  My favorites include the always fresh tasting, perfect pate du foie with perfectly toasted crunchy crostinis.  The salade bleu is just the right portion size with yummy candied almonds. The hummus platter always satisfies and reminds me of simple hummus I've had in Israel & Jordan.  My most favorite dish, by far, has been for breakfast; nowhere have I had a benedict corned beef dish like theirs - fresh corned beef and perfectly poached eggs, amazing!    We visited recently with several out of town visitors and a few of us ordered the scallops dish and they were grilled to perfection, everyone agreed that Amuse Bouche knows how to handle seafood - full flavor and seasoned well!  The meatloaf platter never disappoints as the meat is cooked well without losing juice or flavor - slam dunk for those who love this traditional meal.  The pork chops special was overcooked; however, after dining here many times over the years, this was the only miss in a sea of out-of-the-park hits!  So we won't hold it against them and will definitely be back! :)  The marriage of flavors is just not something you find in most area restaurants, so I recommend you try Amuse Bouche for any occasion.  Please ask for server Kim; she's polite, kind, and very attentive to basic needs, as well as, special requests. :)  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I was a first time visitor to Amuse Bouche on Tuesday, and was rather disappointed by the food. We were greeted and seated immediately by a very helpful and knowledgeable waiter/host.   We were going to a movie after lunch, so we ordered:   1) The Cabernet Burger cooked medium (it came well-done) and accompanied by French fries (which were good, but nothing spectacular). When the burger arrived, I said that doesn't look medium, my companion said, \"it looks well-done.\" We didn't say anything as we had a movie to go to. Companion's verdict on this burger was \"would not order it again,\" regardless of temperature. He also pointed to a lot of fluid from the burger - not sure what that was. I tasted a small bite, and while I like cabernet wine, I didn't like the burger.  2) Salmon Salad - this came with a very large piece of salmon with an exquisite potato and herb crust on top of a whole lot of field greens, a perfectly cooked hard-boiled egg, candied pecans, and tomato. I enjoyed the crusted salmon, pecans, and egg, until I had several bites of distinctly \"fishy\" as in \"old fishy\" salmon in the middle. It was a surprise to have that yucky taste right in the middle of such a good piece of fish. I didn't say anything until after I paid the bill. I wanted to keep the dining experience upbeat and get to the movie.  3) Pot de crème - we ordered this and stated we did not have much time. It was prettily presented with whipped cream and what I think was cocoa on top. The pot de crème was cold (as if from the refrigerator) and the whipped cream was delightfully light. We both thought it would have been a bit more interesting if the chocolate was not so cold. I have read that such desserts might be taken from the refrigerator and set on the counter for 15 minutes before serving. On the other hand, we had told the waiter we were in a hurry and he promptly brought the dish out. --I don't think I would be as picky over this but for our entrees. If I were to give this dessert another chance, I would inquire about letting it sit to warm up a bit (which they may ordinarily do).  My companion didn't tell me what he thought of his meal until later in the car when I specifically asked him.  One other thing about the salmon salad - it had a whole lot of greens with it, and nothing to really break it up... If I made such a dish at home, I would use less greens and perhaps throw in some slices of Persian cucumber, some smaller sliced tomatoes through the salad greens... It just felt rather one dimensional. The dressing was tasty, but it looked like it had been blended at high speed for too long to a thick, almost pudding-like emulsification. The amount of salmon served was about twice what I would consider a serving. (I'd prefer smaller servings.) I had no desire to eat dinner that night (all the protein from the salmon and egg kept me well-sated).  Two other tables were occupied in the restaurant while we were there. One was by a man relishing what looked like a panini and pot de crème. Maybe that is something I should try for lunch. His manner with the waiter suggested to me that he was a regular. Another table was occupied by a couple. I observed one of the couple telling the waiter that something about her quiche was inedible (she also mentioned something about bacon, I think she said it was undercooked). I stopped paying attention and do not know what the resolution was.  Overall, the only way I would test this restaurant again would be for the breakfast. I don't think I would order any seafood dishes from them. I also would try the place as the waiter/host had so much knowledge and was clearly passionate about the place. It makes me hope that what I experienced was an anomaly...or the pangs of a young restaurant trying to grow. The waiter mentioned that the owners now only cook on Sundays as they have a family. I can't help but wonder if the restaurant still needs a bit more watchful care in the kitchen that might best come from the owners.  I am not excited by the menus, especially the crepes. I wish the owners might gain a bit of inspiration from Chez Vous in Scottsdale for crepes.  I was also disappointed by a narrow herbal tea selection...Bigelow. I was hoping for some verveine.... (Chez Vous has it by Harney Brothers)...  I live in Surprise, and would really like some reliably inspiring French food nearby. It's tiresome to have to go to Scottsdale or Phoenix for really good food. I guess I will have to give this restaurant another chance.  One last really small thing... There were loads of fabric/artificial tulips in the planters at the front of the restaurant. This was an odd site in the height of June in Arizona. It is true, such a planter would be low maintenance and not require any care. ---I think a bit more care and detail is merited at this restaurant by the owners at very least in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The quiche is amazing.  Hands down best in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch with friends. The freshly made hummus and pita is an ample start to share.  The Quiche was by far the best I have had and the tomato bisque soup was outstanding.  Service was extraordinary.  This restaurant is small in size but big on flavor and service.  Definitely on my list for a return visit."}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS amazing from the salads and soups, to the meatloaf sandwich, to the divine Sunday Brunch.  I have dined at AB several times and it is always a culinary pleasure. The waitstaff treat you like friends.  They have always been prompt and courteous.   While the portions have not been \"Super\" sized to a typical American standard, I can promise that the portions are MORE than enough.   When such a fabulous place receives rave reviews (from The New York Times to Phoenix Magazine, and more)  people are going to go en mass to try it out...and, well, if you refuse to make reservations please do not pout when you cannot be seated immediately. I have also utilized their talent as caterers for a celebration in my home for business associates and all of my guests were overwhelmed by AB's amazing food.  Guests were trailing after the traveling servers for seconds and thirds.  It was one successful party!!!   The price point of such incredible food is spot on and I would even say it is a GREAT deal!!! To the people who have written poor reviews...please DO go elsewhere because you are making my dining experience an unpleasant one with your presence."}
{"text":"I'M IN EGGS BENEDICT HEAVEN! This is the holy grail for eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce here is out of this world. I could order a cup of it and just drink it straight. The waffles look amazing as well. The belgian waffle is piled high with fresh strawberries and bananas topped with whipped cream and syrup. The plate is so big it could easily feed 2. This is definitely my go to breakfast spot. There are 2 setbacks though. The place is TINY! I'm talking sardines in a can style. And reservations are often difficult. One time I made a reservation ahead of time for a party of 6 and when we showed up (on time), the owner simply said, oh well some people wanted to come inside to eat so I just decided to give up your table, sorry about that.\" ... so we left. That was very annoying. And on many occasions, we have had reservations but still had to wait a while to be seated... But I tend to overlook the small space and disorganization because the food is that good!"}
{"text":"Was busy running errands with my daughter and need to grab lunch.  I've been wanting to try it so bad!  My daughter isn't very adventurous but went with me just the same.  I had a pork Panini and my girl got some kind of baguette sandwich I wasn't really paying attention I was starving!  Both came with a side house salad.  The pork Panini thing was yummy!  I would totally get that again.  My daughter was satisfied as well.  Going back again that's for sure!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday lunch, the place was packed.  We grabbed the only available table outside.  One older waitress explains to us the BYOB policy when we asked for the wine list. Then she says \"I take it you have never been here before?\"  *walks off giggling*  One of my girlfriend walks to a pharmacy near by (recommended by old  waitress), and when she returned with 2 bottles of wine our new waitress tells us \"Oh, well, you can't drink that on the patio!\"  After some disucssion, and our new waitress going inside to talk to the manager, they allowed us to drink but said it would only be this one time.  Later other patrons next to us began complaining where we could hear them \"Why do THEY get to drink on the patio?\"  Needless to say it was a VERY unpleasant experience, and I will not be returning.  From now on I will happily drive to downtown PHX from Surprise to meet my girlfriends for lunch where I know where to find this same quality of food but far superior customer service."}
{"text":"I had written a rather negative review, not about the food which was quite good, about how the staff badly mishandled an issue with a take/out order. I also wrote to the owner on their website with the same concerns. I must tell you I received a very clear and detailed email agreeing with me completely concerning the issue and understood my feelings. He generously refunded the order and invited me to return. I plan to do just that."}
{"text":"Fast friendly good service.  I had breakfast.  The tomatoe mushroom crepes with swiss  cheese .the portion was enough for two. My server sherry was very attentive ."}
{"text":"My husband and I very much enjoyed breakfast at Amuse Bouche recently. This was our first meal at the restaurant and it will not be our last. We'd heard reservations were recommended but since it was the middle of July and we planned to get there soon after they opened, we took our chances. There was only one other customer there prior to opening so we didn't have to wait in line but the restaurant did fill up steadily after that.   We shared the beignets and my only regret was wearing a black top--the piping hot pastries were covered in a fluffy layer of powdered sugar just as they should be. I ordered the corned beef Benedict served with country potatoes which was delicious. The corned beef is made in house and the flavor reflects that--more delicate in taste and texture than most other restaurants serve. Cover that in a silky Hollandiase sauce and it's heaven on a plate. It came with country potatoes that were perfectly cooked to my liking--crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. My husband had a waffle with fruit and freshly whipped cream that was also delicious. We're thinking of splitting a plate next time as each of our dishes was much more ample than we expected.   The restaurant is small, so if you're planning to visit during snowbird season or the lunch, dinner or breakfast rush any time of year definitely reserve your table. The only drawback is they don't use Open Table so you have to call to make a reservation for your party like it's 1999."}
{"text":"Stopped in year for New Years lunch and we picked a perfect time because our waitress said it's normally packed and we were alone. :-). We ordered a hummus platter (fresh, grilled pita ) and authentic hummus. I ordered the Parisian baguette and hubby had the special, a pork tenderloin panini. Both came with fries and we ordered iced tea. I was in heaven between the iced tea and the fries (as was he ) and it took me a minute to pay attention to the main.  We would both. Like to come back for breakfast on a Sunday for the beignets... And actually some dessert. The dinner menu didn't pique our interest but that's ok! Sweet, quaint atmosphere. Waitress was personable, sincere, and very welcoming.  Definitely recommend -- support local !"}
{"text":"Went here the other night and had dinner with friends we all ordered something different so we could try each others everything was amazing then we ordered two of the deserts the blueberry bread pudding with a Carmel sauce was to die for order it best desert I have ever had in my life"}
{"text":"Has huge potential.  I ordered the quinoa and kale salad with chicken breast.  I asked for it with dressing on the side, they forgot but quickly brought a new one out and it looked attractive. The salad was missing the almonds as describe in the menu, and there were dried cranberries added that weren't on the menu. The two huge balls of goat cheese was just too much, it was warm and hard to break up any because it was so gooey I couldn't eat it.  The chicken was super dry and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave for too long.  My friend got the Cabernet Burger with fries.  The fries were really good, as was the hamburger.  He also ordered the bread pudding (I didn't try it). It was attractive on the dish and he said it was an A+. The waitress was nice, and attentive. The odd thing that bugged me ( I Am a little OCD) was there were tables that needed to be wiped off the entire time we were eating.  There was also paper napkins under the table that should have been picked up. There were only 2 other customers there so not busy.  No one wants to sit to have a nice lunch and look at dirty tables.  But, I would go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. The chef/owner is a great individual that loves to interact with his customers. We ate lunch as a group. All of us ordered burgers. All medium rare except one well done. He actually came out to our table to make sure our medium rare burgers weren't too cold since they had to sit and wait till the well done was cooked. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the sentiments below. Yes it's a small restaurant, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in flavor. This is a rare gem this far west in Surprise. The food is flavorful, well presented, and the service is pleasant. I have had the Paella and the Lobster Mac & Cheese and was supremely impressed by both. My companions were in agreement...fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their benes and I always get the corn beef benedict!  Best homemade hollandaise sauce! Make sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"Amazingly wonderful Easter brunch!  Perfect food, great service. Never knew they had breakfast. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is definitely not a restaurant for large parties of more than about 6 people. The whole restaurant is about ten tables big, if that. It is a small, quaint location with excellent service.   You can expect mostly paninis, soup, salad, and entrees like fish and chips. It is a a tad bit pricey, but not really. You will spend about ten bucks a person on an entree and that isn't all that bad.   Next time I go there I am going to just get soup and salad so I can gorge myself on their desserts. I had a fancy pants peach cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream. Makes mouth happy. I'm going to say it's not that it couldn't be kid friendly, but most of the things on the menu definitely have grown up tastes and portions to them.   Also, they are only open to about 7 pm or so, so don't expect to get a super late dinner there."}
{"text":"Went to the Regional Dinner last night. It was cuisine of Spain (missed out on Switzerland last week) and the place was packed for good reason. Absolutely delicious from start to finish. Tried foods I thought I would never enjoy but to my surprise learned I love clams. Can't wait to see what the next Regional Dinner will be.  Make sure to make your reservations ASAP and come hungry."}
{"text":"Totally awesome.  Best french food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Incredible food. I had a great Cuban panini and the quiche Lorraine was superb. The desserts are also incredible, including the creme brulee and raspberry bread pudding. It's a small restaurant with not much inside seating, so be prepared."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the last 2-3 years and it has always been superb.  The quiche Lorraine is so wonderful, just like a custard which it should be.  Sandwiches are excellent.  And dinners are really good.  I go often."}
{"text":"Have not been to Amuse Bouche for quite sometime, actually more than a year.  I needed to bring home dinner tonight and wanted something more than just fast food. I called Amuse Bouche ahead of time and ordered two entrees for pick up at the end of the day. I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before my \"pick up\" time and I knew I was early but did not mind the wait. I was very happy that my meals were not ready as I did not want them to be packed and waiting for pick up as other restaurants do. I was pleased to watch the chef actually prepare my order and I had a wonderful conversation with the hostess during my wait. I surprised my husband with dinner which was Beef Stoganoff and Meatloaf. We open a bottle of red wine and enjoyed our meal. Both entrees were delicious and we even have some left over! I know that I will not wait another year before I return!"}
{"text":"Slow and not customer-focused service. Took 20 min to bring the salads (there were only 4 people on the floor at the time and we actually reserved our seats!). If you are not too hungry they will charge you $3 to split the order :-("}
{"text":"This is for takeout only. My husband had a lunch meeting there so I asked him to pick me up the chicken salad. He ordered it when he was leaving. When he brought it home I was very disappointed to see it was pretty much a bag of lettuce with a few strips of chicken, a few onions, maybe a strip of undercooked bacon in a clump at the bottom, and a few slices of apple. The chicken was good. They put a roll in a separate box with some butter. It's 100+ degrees so of course it melted and soaked the bread making it mushy. It was disappointing...$14 for a 1/2 a chicken breast and a bag of lettuce. No thanks."}
{"text":"This review is based on one lunch visit.  Having lived in Paris, I ordered only specifically French items:  quiche lorraine, French onion soup and the basket of croissants.  The quiche was excellent, perfectly seasoned, creamy and rich with lots of chopped bacon, as it should be.  Also, a very generous salad came with  good (and sufficient) dressing).  The only minor issue is that the crust could have been more crisp.  I give this dish an A-. The French onion soup was also authentic, with a rich broth, lots of gruyere  cheese and a chunk of a baguette on the top.  Baked in the oven with the top all melted, unlike the ersatz version found in many American restaurants.    Again, the only caveat is that it was a little too salty, which didn't prevent it from being delicious.  An A-.   The basket of croissants came  with four small heated croissants, plus four small scoops of butter and a scoop of jam, each in their own little container.  They were good, buttery and tasty, although not as crusty and layered as the best croissant are.  B+.    The small restaurant was nicely decorated with French pictures and bright colors, with an outdoor patio that could seat about 10-12 people. The food was a bit slow in coming, especially since we were almost the only customers, but we were told it would take 15 minutes to prepare the croissant, and the food was carefully prepared and hot when it arrived. Service was efficient rather than friendly (very French) but everything was done properly, no complaints.  The bill with tax was $27.92, and clearly stated that this was \"pre-tip amount\", unlike in France where the tip (service compris) is automatically added to the bill.  I think the prices are a bit high for those dishes, but the overall quality was very good and I would happily return.  And another big plus, very soft music in the background, rather than the usual blaring sounds that hinder conversation in so many restaurants now.  A good local restaurant."}
{"text":"We have looked forward to dining here for a year or more and were disappointed last night. While our server was a nice young lady the management should spend some time training.  Our party of four ordered Mussel's as a shared appetizer which were pretty good. However only two slices of bread were provided and there was no spoon to use for serving onto our plates. Instead of plates shallow bowls should have been provided so we could enjoy some of the broth.   There was a long delay between the time we ordered and when we received our orders. Our server told us they were short staffed resulting in delays in the kitchen.   Once our orders arrived we were surprised at the appearance of our individual orders,  a pasta dish was poorly sauced, the pasta was in bits and pieces and quite lumpy and dry. Beef Bourgegion was okay however the whipped potatoes were off color as if in the steam table too long and the portion of beef was very small.  A Pork Tenderloin dish was also small portioned and tough as well as unattractively dished and the whipped potatoes were also off color from being in the steam table too long. The Salmon in filo dough was good.  We ordered bread pudding and crepe to share and were so surprised that they weren't garnished with whipped cream.   They have remodeled to a larger room and as a result more customers are seated. They had better figure out how to serve these customers in a more timely manner and get production issues ironed out in the kitchen.   I don't mind high prices IF I receive great food and service."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast a couple of weeks ago and the food was excellent as well as the coffee. I will be back for many more meals. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Cab burger is the best item on their lunch menu!!! LOVE it... between that and their Sunday brunch Salmon Eggs Benedict.... mmmm....pretty sure I just started drooling.... Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Last nights dinner with another couple overall was fair. The service was at best poor.  The waiter did not write down our orders and so forgot 2 salads had been ordered and brought only one. When asked about the other salad he made a somewhat smart remark and then went for the missing salad. Our order consisted of Duck, Hanger Steak & 2 orders of Scallops.  The food was not served together the duck and steak (which was at best warm) were brought to the table and about 5 minutes later the 2 orders of scallops were served. I should mention that, including our party of 4, there were only 10 people in the restaurant at the time. The waiter did not show up at the table again until he brought our bills. So what do we get this time at Amuse Bouche for about $80 per couple - Poor Service, 1 cold (but tasty) meal, & very small portions of everything I think the quality of the restaurant has gone done.  We had breakfast there on Easter Sunday and Eggs Benedict were only fair."}
{"text":"This charming restaurant is a beacon of hope and light on the West side for great eats.  At this point we've been there countless times and enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Their BYO wine and beer policy is great.  We usually take a few bottles of wine since there are various specials that we might want to pair with the food.  They do eggs at brunch better than anyone around, plus made-to-order Hollandaise sauce on the Benedict.  The food portions and style is very honest- they have a hard working french style bistro with an American twist. The owner-chefs were trained in France and it shows in the quality and care of the food.   The food is always fresh - highly recommend dinner.  Try the duck, meatloaf, fresh scallops (the largest we have had in AZ anywhere) - everything is good.  Reserve ahead as the tables fill up fast."}
{"text":"Saturday LUNCH anyone... Or Sunday Brunch?  Live in the West Valley and tired of driving to Central Phoenix for some of those unique restaurants and not going to the same Chains? Looking for something you can take friends and family to where you know they will come back saying... Ooh Yeah! Let me introduce you to Amuse Bouche Bistro.  The staff is stellar and extremely knowledgeable of the menu, even had suggestions on what to get. When you enter the Bistro and they say Thanks for Coming...that's how every restaurant should welcome their guests. From the food to the ambiance and the spectacular staff it was truly a pleasure dining at ABB!"}
{"text":"Meat loaf sandwich was moist with a tomato bacon sauce, along with an onion aioli. Yum.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Lunch early afternoon cook and waitress are less than stellar as well as the food during this time.  Our Cabernet burgers were overcooked when we asked for medium well.  This is the second time as of recently that we have have been there and have been unhappy with the wait staff and cook. When the owners are cooking the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner last night and was very disappointed. Haven't been here in over a year and things have changed!  My pasta was of the grocery store variety an looked left over. The pork tenderloin was tough. The bread pudding and crepes were tasty but lacked attention to detail. Whipped cream would have been nice.  Service was  great!  Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Husband and I shared bacon wrapped, cheese stuffed dates. Pricey, but very good. We also shared a croque monsuier ? that was tasty and very filling. Sandwich came with a field greens salad with candied nuts. Friendly service. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the blueberry bread pudding. My husband and I shared the meatloaf and he really liked it. I can't fairly give my opinion as I'm not much of a meat eater. A couple things to note: The menu changes so call ahead. It is small ... Smaller than my bedroom, so go in expecting such. The staff was friendly and helpful. I look forward to trying the breakfast."}
{"text":"I love a good vegetable sandwich.  I don't mind paying a premium for getting what I love.  Unfortunately, the veggie sandwich I had at Amuse Bouche - recommended by the server - was stunningly mediocre, considering my bill ended up being somewhere around $13 bucks for a sandwich and a few fries.  The aioli was bland, there was an amount of cheese that went beyond the realm of good taste, and the roasted vegetables were sopping wet from the marinade or braising sauce or whatever they used - oily and overpowering, not tasty and delicious.  I make occasional trips to Buckeye and Surprise for work, and was hoping to find a gem in the West Valley based on the reviews of this place.  It wasn't completely bad - just priced at a point they'd never be able to get away with if there were more competition for the dollars of Sun City Festival residents."}
{"text":"Yum! Quiche is fantastic! The hollandaise sauce like butter!!!"}
{"text":"Been for sunday brunch and lunch a few times and the food impressed me and my husband, but the last lunch was very disappointing in more than one way. The same dish we ordered before was so good that we ordered the same thing but the 3 of us who ordered it didnt finish it because it was not good. I mentioned to the waitress that it was very different than last time but she disagreed and went on her way. We were left at the table with food we did not eat.  I mentioned again that the batter was undercooked and thick but her response was that it was the same recipe so....nothing again. She just cleared the plates and brought the check. We paid it. As my family left, i stayed behind to just let the other waitress know we didnt enjoy our meal and asked why it was different.  She also said it was the same recipe so it shouldn't be different.  Wow, at this point im disappointed and told im making this up. Until she finally told me the truth...were training a new cook so it might be a little different.  No apology either...the front staff needs a bit of refining. The service is half the experience, it needs to be a friendly atmosphere to succeed. I gave 4 stars for the sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I live in Park City, UT and come out to Surprise to visit my mom. My stepdad has a daughter living in Sweden and her Swedish friends told her about this place, I was intrigued.  This place did not disappoint! I had a dinner special, filet mignon topped with crab. I was giddy at first bite, it was that good. My husband had scallops, they were perfectly cooked. I liked that it was BYOB, there is a $3 corkage fee per person. We had the blueberry bread pudding with caramel sauce, it was amazing! It took a little time to get our food, but we hardly noticed, we got the hummus appetizer to tide us over.  I've been coming out to Surprise for about 5 years, this is the best place I've eaten at, by far. The food here is better than most of the fancy restaurants in my home of Park City, UT. Pricey, yes, but also the best restaurant meal I've had in a LONG time."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Amuse Bouche for breakfast. We always order the Salmon Eggs Benedict. The eggs are poached to perfection and the hollendaise sauce is light buttery lemon sunshine! My son gets the belgian waffle with strawberries and bananas, home made whipped cream and warm syrup. The potatoes on the side are delectable, crisp on the outside and fluffy when you take a bite! We alway! ALWAYS! get beignets and the croissant basket and a side of bacon and sausage! The service is warm, friendly and attentive. Absolutely brilliant breakfasts!"}
{"text":"I hired AB to cater a private event in my home and I actually had guests follow the servers throughout the party...my guests couldn't resist snatching up more tasty morsels (even though there was PLENTY of food to go around)!!!!  Amazing catering. Truly.  I've tried other caterers and they were good, but not AB great.  Professionals!  Food is amazing!!!   I've also attended social events where AB was the caterer. They were able to pull it off amazingly well with such a large crowd.  Quiche is exquisite!   Most recently, I had the opportunity to try their version of tacos at the Arizona Taco Festival at the Salt River Fields and, BY FAR, they were the BEST tacos (but those are not on the restaurant menu...just saying...these chefs are versatile!!!)  Since moving to East Phoenix, I still make the trek for myself and for any out-of-state visitors of mine because I know they need to try this special place.  This place is that good.  If it is high season (winter) please do not expect immediate seating or seating at all.  This is a quaint bistro that many many many people love.  If it is a special occasion, call ahead and make reservations!"}
{"text":"Limited menu with some great dishes Gourmet quality  Limited seating Great for a lunch  Small portions, but good quality  Would return again"}
{"text":"I am really sad to have to give this place a 1 star. We have been here quite a few times and have had wonderful service and been treated great, however when we came in today it was a different story. Being military we have always received a military discount on out bill on previous visits. When we asked today they informed us that they didn't have military discount. When we let them know that we had been offered it in the past the waitress, Kim, seemed annoyed by our request. When we gave her the military ID she then preceded to say, very loudly for others to hear, that our ID was expired, which was not true. When we showed her the expiration date on the ID she once again was rude and disrespectful. Unfortunately the unprofessional and rude behavior of this waitress, Kim, towards our military members has deterred us from ever visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Our go-to for Sunday brunch. Their Waffle and Eggs Benedict with potatoes are incredible!"}
{"text":"This is the best we found in the area. Like all of the area this little place is in the middle of a shopping area. In the sense of small, almost crowded and busy restaurant this can be considered in the light of a French restaurant. Be warned that the size of the dishes are all American.   All of the food we enjoyed was fantastic. The server had a lot of experience with the menu and made excellent suggestions. We ate off of there special menu once and couldn't believe the short rib and the chicken. They were both exceptionally tender and tasty.   Just don't forget to bring a bottle of wine with you for the meal."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service. I truly appreciate having this place in Surprise."}
{"text":"We took my mother in law out to this cute little place on Mother's Day last weekend.  I'm glad we made a reservation because it was very busy.  We each had a beignet and I tried the eggs benedict florentine.  I thought everything was delicious and service was fast and friendly despite the large number of people in the restaurant.  They even gave my mother in law a rose at the end of our meal.  I would love to return here to try their dinner sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this restaurant, my friend spoke highly about this restaurant. When we went the waitress/ hostess was very rude to us. She Embarrassed  us in front of all the other customers in the restaurant. This was our first visit. The food was not all that, I had fish and chips  My husband had a sandwich.     We will not be returning.  The Owner needs to know that there waitress is running off there business."}
{"text":"This is THE one restaurant that is always on our list of favorites.  Meatloaf sandwich is better than homemade. I've never had anything that I didn't like. It's BYOB for a small corkage fee, so you can bring your favorite and stay within a budget. Service is usually great, but it can get a little noisy in such a small space.  Update:  5 stars to 3 in one swoop.   I am VERY disappointed today that they were not able to honor the reservation we made for Mother's Day (Unless I was willing to have my elderly parents join the rest of the throng waiting in the sun and heat for a seat). The hostess informed me that I wouldn't be checking in, but put at the bottom of the list even though WE arrived 5 minutes early.   A different party had been waiting for 40 minutes past their reservation, but had to get out of the heat.  Too bad. REALLY, it was too bad. Good thing is that I make a mean béarnaise and Safeway has all of ingredients for a lovely Mother's Day meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs Benedict as a takeout order. They wait and assemble it fresh when you get there so it doesn't get all smooshy...it was excellent! I'm excited to go there again and try more menu items. The beignets looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Enjoyed lunch with family, had the Quiche Lorraine and it was cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed my favorite dessert, Creme Brûlée, and savored every last bite. Highly recommended. Hoping to try breakfast and dinner soon. My only wish is that this establishment was bigger."}
{"text":"Chef owned gem! This is the best lunch place in Surprise, but the dinner menu is the best. The small dining room is a bit of an issue with the giant lunch crowd, but dinner is usually better. If you live near, I highly recommend doing take-out and enjoying the great food in your own dining room. Since the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, take-out allows you to enjoy a great bottle of wine with your meal."}
{"text":"Amuse Bouche Bistro caters the most incredible Thanksgiving meal I've ever had! Not just the traditional turkey but and wonderful tender lamb as well! All the sides were just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Two stars for getting seated quickly and having the order taken and brought quickly. The food was not representative of good French food. The flavor of the traditional Benedict was only salty with no other discernible flavor and the hash Benedict had no flavor. The potatoes were dripping in grease and the beignets were over cooked. I'm picky though , so feel free to try and disprove my rating...."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place,brought back some great memories from my visit in Provence,fr. The menu is INcredibly delicious.I was there for brunch and cannot wait to make a reservation for dinner..Don't forget to bring your own Wine,etc.and order the Beignets to start..Au'Revoir"}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice now since the place is literally 5 minutes from my house and I am so tired of chain-restaurants, which is all we seem to have here.  The first time I went for lunch and had the cabernet burger.  The wait was long and the waitstaff not too friendly but for lunch, that didn't bother me much.  I did get a bad stomach ache after eating, my guess was that the burger was too heavy with too much cheese-sauce etc (disclaimer: I try to eat fresh and light, dairy free food as on a daily basis so I probably have a lower tolerance than most on the rare occasion that I do indulge).  The burger did taste very good but it was pricey.  Last night my husband and I went for dinner.  I called ahead and requested a table against the back wall.  The lady on the phone told me \"she wasn't sure but she would see what she could do\".  Based on that, I was expecting to see a packed restaurant when I arrived, yet we were the only two couples in there (it was early, right after they opened).  Since it's BYOB, we each brought a bottle of Chimay.  It does look like a wine bottle (its beer), but the waitress' reaction was unexcusable.  She said \"okay, which one would you like me to open\".  My husband replied \"both\", to which she said \"excuse me? Both at the same time?!?\".  Then she looked at the bottles closer and said \"oh, it's beer, not wine.  I was about to saayyyy...\"   What the H?  I don't care if I bring in a case of wine to drink by myself, such an unprofessional reaction is inexcusable.  It gets better.  We ordered the pate for appetizer, which was good but too cold. I then asked her if I could swap out the side on the duck breast (bread pudding) for something else since I love duck but abhore bread pudding.  Her response was \"well, I'm not sure.  I'll have to ask the chef if he agrees, he tends to get funny about that\".  Excuse me? If I happen to not like a side or am allergic to one, you're going to force me to eat it if the chef does not \"agree\" with my choices? I told her \"well, he can either swap out the side dish and sell me a $28 duck, or I will have the $8 soup\".   She huffed away and came back saying \"well, the reason he doesn't want to swap things out is because he orders only so many things for one night, but in this case he has agreed to do it\".  Wait a minute, you're telling me the chef only stocks so many potatoes based on what? How many people his crystall ball tell him will order it that night? Ridiculous!  It soured the whole dining experience for me.  Anyways, I ordered the duck medium well, it came out rare.  My husband had the halibut and it was drenched in sauce. The \"fresh\" mashed potatoes were so runny (butter? milk? cream? not sure) they practically flowed off my plate.  The duck was bland, I've had much much better in many places accross the valley.  We ordered the chocolate pot au creme in an attempt to save the dinner and that fell flat too.  I guess they tried to make it \"dense and rich\" which basically rendered it inedible.  To top it off, both myhusband and I got sick (not throwing up sick but a bad stomach ache and lots of bloating about an hour after the dinner, second time for that) Now, full disclosure: I was born and raised in Belgium.  I live for an occasional splurge of  french food and I've eaten in many small places around the world  that honor the french cuisine and work miracles with fresh and rare ingredients.  This place does neither.  The food is commercial, overcooked, bland and laced in butter and cream. The only thing french is the attitudes of the waitstaff and the chef, which they might want to drop given this is Surprise, AZ and not France and customers are used to choices and friendliness. This is NOT the wonderful experience that French cuisine can be.  Go to Christopher's at the biltmore or Vogue Bistro and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"The best quiche we've ever had.  Mom had the mushroom and onion and I had the Lorraine.  Next time we're bringing our own wine and coming for dessert.  Very small,  just like a European cafe."}
{"text":"I've been back here and unfortunately the service has gotten worse.  The waffles and egg benedict were still very good.  I believe they should get someone new to host and waitress.    There are two gals that seem to be there and the smaller one just seems rude and forgetful.  Instead of apologizing for her error she comes across like you are an inconvenience.  It just makes for a poor experience on what could have been a nice brunch."}
{"text":"Saw the place on yelp and it had great reviews.   The food is very good, so come here with a healthy appetite. You won't be disappointed.   We came here with friends. We ordered the following: lamb panini, Cabernet burger, grilled ham & cheese sandwich, and pate. Loved the lamb on panini with the garlic aioli. The burger was good, cooked at the right temperature and had a very good flavor. We got the grilled cheese & ham for the kids, but they did an amazing job, almost wished I had ordered it instead. Lol But the star of the show had to be the pate!  My wife and our friend kept going on and on about it!    The service was good. They only had one person when we went who was our hostess/server. Very friendly/attentive despite being the only person in the front. I say it took about 15 mins for our food to be delivered. But it's a smaller place and I can only imagine there was probably only one cook in the back. But the food came out nice and hot, so we didn't mind the wait. It was well worth it.   The price on the items was very decently priced. And I love the menu because it was simple, wasn't over burden with 60 options. I believe most of the items was under 12, so not too bad.   The place is on the smaller end like I stated before, but they do offer both indoor & outdoor seating. It was well kept up, no dirty tables. Very clean bathrooms.  I really like the mural of a street in Paris on the wall. The entire place had a lot of character.   It's located in a shopping center, so lots of parking.  I just yelped it and went to GPS, right off of Cotton in Surprise. Can't miss it.   Overall I really like this place. Would recommend this place to anyone. The food was great, the service was good even with them being short handed. Nice quite place to have lunch or a early dinner."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place 2.5 stars.  There were a few service hiccups that do not seem consistent with the atmosphere they're obviously seeking.  Our main entrees were brought when my husband was still eating his appetizer causing us to scramble to find room for all of the dishes.  My husband's appetizer dish (which was a long rectangular dish and not at all inconspicuous) sat ON the table until dessert dishes were cleared.  Space is at a premium here (so much so that two of our dining companions were bumped by neighboring diners and food had to be passed down the tables as the servers couldn't get to the people at the end).  It also seemed rather expensive.    The food was okay.  My salad wasn't tossed terribly well and despite the description that mentioned candied walnuts, I think I located exactly one.  My filet was quality and cooked well but someone was rather heavy-handed with the demiglace in the kitchen.  My aunt's filet was oversauced as well.  It probably wouldn't have been an issue except it was salty.  (And I LOVE salt so me describing something as salty should tell you something.)    The bread pudding was delicious although the blueberries were completely drowned out by the caramel sauce.  Overall...  eh."}
{"text":"The burger & meatloaf sandwich are amazing!!  The quiche is the best I've ever had, how a quiche should be cooked! Sunday brunch is my favorite... even the yogurt is delicious!  (we've eaten there several times now!)"}
{"text":"I love this place but when we arrived at 6:30. It was not open even though you say open till 8 pm  Came on Sunday open til 1pm. Usually love the food but not so much today. Bacon and tomato crepe way too greasy. Service slow and not friendly."}
{"text":"So very disappointed, took my Mother there today for the brunch.  Had read the great reviews and the place was crowded- both good signs for a restaurant!  Accordingly we thought we were in for something special.  The service was fantastic.  My boyfriend and I both ordered eggs Benedict, Mom ordered a ham crepe with mornay sauce.  I was able to eat my eggs, but the ham was so salty I couldn't eat the rest of my food and gave my plate to my \" give it to Mikey he'll eat anything\" boyfriend.  He ate it but said he wished we had stayed home.  Mom said her crepe was \"meh\".  Disappointing Mother's Day brunch but they did give us a very pretty rose to take home."}
{"text":"Again, let me start by saying I have 22 years of restaurant experience. Just came back from Sunday \"brunch\" at Amuse Bouche. I was really looking forward to the meal. I was totally disappointed.   First: The staff: What the hell do they think they are serving? The attitude was that of an extremely high end European bistro and Amuse Bouche falls WAAAAAAY short of that. REALLY STAFF drop the bullshit attitudes and take a good look at your surroundings and TASTE the food on the plates..it really is not that good to warrant the attitude. Kitchen staff looked like they just woke up and threw on something off the floor from the bar the night before.....really unsightly. THE FOOD: Looked nice taste was really at best mediocre. I do not get it....it could be a gem but unfortunately it is a dud. Can someone please tell me why this is classified as French ? Is it the name of the place just so happens to be two French words? Nothing about the place is French other than the name. Known for their Benedicts...then they should be better. Known for the Quiche.....then it should be better. A must try Beignets.....Have any of you ever been to Cafe Du Monde ? Brunch ? Ummm no that was not brunch by ANY definition. Really bland odd corned beef hash.........I love CBH and this was bad.....really bad. Clientele: The clientele base really should know better. I think they do but for some reason they are there anyway."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite places. I've had the meat loaf sandwich no less than 5 times and combined with the salad make it the perfect lunch. I highly recommend this place and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Amuse Bouche and this place is phenomenal I've been here for breakfast and lunch. The Belgian waffles were delicious , I've also had the quiche Lorraine  I can't wait to go for dinner , if you're considering having dinner here I strongly recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  We happened to be in Surprise on a Sunday morning, and we were looking for a breakfast spot.  Yelpers suggested Amuse Bouche so we called the restaurant from the car, got a reservation for a short time later (about our driving time), and were seated right after our arrival.  The reservation was a good idea, since they were really busy.  The food was great!  I had the Eggs  Benedict and my foodie partner had the Quiche Lorraine.  Each was terrific, as were the OJ and coffee.  The powdered sugar-covered pastries that we had as a prelude were super, even though they were very powdery.  We wore the powdered sugar as a badge of honor.  The service was excellent.  The place is small and crowded, but the staff were friendly and efficient.  It's a happy place!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to go against the flow of the other reviews on this one.   My wife and myself had decided to try this place out based on recommendations from friends and the reviews on yelp.    The restaurant is small, about 10 tables.  It's literally a catering company that has a few tables in the front.  It's has the basic decorations, but nothing special.  First thing is that I was surprised by the prices.  Dinners begin at $15 (only 2 meals available at this price) and quickly go up to $35/plate.    I figured it'd be in line with Vogue which is around $15-20/plate and has much more atmosphere.  I got the Fish and Chips, my wife got the meatloaf and we split a bowl of the bisque special.  All of the food was good but we both found it to be heavy and it didn't sit well for either of us.  We've also noticed that all 3 dishes were heavy in salt, especially the soup.    I was really disappointed as I really had my hopes up after all of the good reviews."}
{"text":"Dinner several times over the Holidays has found my husband and I frequent future dinners of this fantastic restaurant.  The braised short ribs, glazed carrot and mashed potatoes was exquisite.  Both the lamb fishes with either the biscuit or papperdalla were seasoned beautifully.  We also had the fresh baquette with three cheeses and cranberry chutney which melted in your mouth.  Eating at Amuse Bouche is a wonderful experience.  Bring your favorite wine and plan to stay for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"My mother has been a huge fan of their brunch for years, and it's become my go-to brunch when visiting my parents in Arizona. The staff are incredibly friendly and the food is great. Love the beignets and the different benedict options.  You can bring your own champagne for brunch too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food and Great service. They may need to expand to a bigger location because people should be eating at this place daily!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun small restaurant. The food is amazing, and the BYOB policy and sit on the patio atmosphere is the most relaxing thing in the world - no great views, just a parking lot, so bring someone interesting to talk to and enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday breakfast. Excellent food, excellent service. My home made corned beef hash Benedict was truly exceptional. Others ate the Beignets and raved about them. They smelled so good it took al my will power not to be a pig and eat those too. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Here ia the deal. The back of the house has their act together, for the most part. The front of the house, not so much. The location is too small are very crowded, expecially in the winter with all the snowbirds. The waitstaff and hostess become overwhelmed... When you're running this type of restaurant service is a huge part of the over all experience. In the service department this place is about on par with Dennys. Now on to the food. I'm pretty sure the breakfast menu has been the same for years, but it is definitely good. I would recommend this place once the snowbirds leave OR if you have zen like patients."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the 1st time. It was for breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict, followed up with a Beignet. It was way beyond my expectations. The food, as well as the presentation surpassed some of the 5 star restaurants I've frequented. Being from the east coast, these are the type places you seek out away from all those \"Big Box Restaurants\". This is truly a find. Very intimate, and the entire staff very professional, and very friendly! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I walked into amuse and was asked if I had a to go order, which I did not. The hostess then began reading through reservations aloud for me to hear, as if to say it's an inconvenience to serve you before reserved patrons. I was alone and only wanted coffee and beniets. It took about 15 min for me to order and then check out. I must add that neither item were worth mentioning. As a Louisiana native I know beniets. Theirs aren't even close. Coffee was weak and moderately warm. I could lol past that but I cannot look past the rudeness. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch recently at Amuse Bouche with my good friend and littlest guy.  I enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad while she had one of the paninis of the day. I was a little disappointed that the best they could offer for little people is a grilled cheese sandwich. Not that I'm looking for a whole litany of options and I understand that the point of this little bistro is that it's supposed to be a bit upscale, but if you're open for lunch in Surprise, a family-centered community, adding some kid friendly options might not be soooo bad and could help put butts in the seats during the weekday.   I found the service to be nice but they were a little snooty when we first arrived and eyeballed my son. I thought overall service was slow considering what we ordered and the grilled cheese came out cold. It was not busy at all so not sure about the delay. The salad was just ok. The panini was just ok. Having patio dining was nice though. The wait staff warmed up when they saw how well behaved my boy was but first impressions are hard to take back.  After reading such rave reviews on Yelp about this place, I honestly felt it fell short from a lunch perspective. I may considering trying again at dinner, sans children, and really get a little more in-depth with the menu options. So for now, my review is that Amuse Bouche is just ok when it comes to a lunch time spot in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great place.  Small and intimate and superb food.  Service is very good.  Recently went for their prime rib special and it was great. Included two sides and dessert. I always have their house salad with blue cheese crumbles -- nuts, fresh greens, cranberries and a great dressing.  I've eaten there many times over the past few years -- super brunch and excellent lunches (quiche is great)."}
{"text":"I was out in Arizona for business and met with my family. They took me to dinner to Amuse Bouche. The night we went there was one table available and we snagged it. I was observing the other patrons and all I could hear was how delicious the food was. We started off with 2 appetizers Polynesian Shrimp with coconut-lime broth, which was delicious and had a freshness about the broth and Fromage Fort, the combination of fresh bread and melted cheese along with fig marmalade, sweet mustard and tiny olives what a delicious combination. Then on to the soup portion. I have had French Onion in many restaurants, but their French Onion tasted great. I have low tolerance to salt and I could not taste the salt. The broth was fabulous. My main entree was Chicken Francese. If you love lemon asparagus and chicken. This is a must. It was served on a nice serving of angel hair pasta. That night they were serving fresh Halibut which was sold out by 7:00. I heard their fish is impeccable. They haven't obtained their liquor license yet. Don't let that stop you, just bring your own and they will cork it for you.   I would say Amuse Bousche is right up there with Fine Dining. I live in a city where you have your choice of fine dining and Amuse Bouche has that atmosphere of fine dining but with a relaxed feeling. On my next business trip I hope to make my way there."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place. Claims to be a gourmet \"takeout\" but there are a few tables inside and out that you can sit at, despite the fact that the entire shop is roughly the size of my master bedroom's crapper. I got their menu and will scan and post it when I get around to it. Since I was the designated food bringer-homer, I ordered a lamb panini for myself and a flank steak panini for my wife, along with an order of blueberry bread pudding and mille feuille, which the lady informed me meant \"a thousand layers\", confirming what I already knew from high-school French. The paninis came in boxes which also contained a reasonably boring salad spruced up with a fairly tasty balsamic dressing and candied pecans - the first time I believe I've ever had those. They added a little something that improved the taste further.  The panini was delicious; the lamb part of it, anyway. It's real hard to get good lamb in this city, especially lamb that tasted this good. I'm dead sick of typical lamb dishes in the US where everyone seems to think that you cannot prepare lamb without rosemary (==FALSE). The sweet onions with it were perfect. I didn't like the crusty bread that it was on - maybe that's the standard for a panini but I'd have preferred something that didn't rip the roof of my mouth wide open.  Two minor issues with this place. Firstly, it's too expensive. The paninis at $10 each are right at the upper limit of what I'd pay for what I got. Other dishes, like the fish and chips, are exorbitantly priced - would you pay $16 for F&C? There's another steak dish they have for $23 which is probably the filet with carrot butter (the menu's downstairs or I'd check again) - get serious, this place is a tiny hole in the wall and I'd expect nothing over $12, even if the chef DID have a French accent. And even if they DO mix carrots with butter.  Second thing. That kid that blows raspberries and mutters \"chocolate\" into her dad's armpit or whatever was there again. This time Grandpa brought her in. She ran around for a bit, then she sat down and her mum (behind the counter) brought her out some hummus to eat (?!), all the time giggling about how the little girl was wearing her \"pirate shoes\" or something. Okay. This is a take-out shop, not Disneyland. If I want family-style hijinks I'll go to Chucky Cheese, not what I thought was a gourmet French place. Kiddy stay home when mummy and daddy worky; customer eat and leave happy. I'm not one of those people that smiles beatifically when young kids caper about and drool over candy. Unless it's my kid. You can imagine what Halloween is like at my house. Fortunately I only spent a short time in there while waiting for my food to be prepared.  Four stars this time purely on the strength of the lamb panini and the fact that the counter gal was nice enough to give me a cold glass of water while I waited. The desserts are still in my fridge from when I went there yesterday and I'll probably eat one or both of them tomorrow, since we already had an early dessert from Ritters this afternoon. *8-) I don't think they'll change my rating either way, though."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant twice in two weeks to see if our opinion would improve. Their main dish salads are ridiculously small! And I mean ridiculously small! My husband had the French dip and switched out his french fries for a side salad. The side salad on his plate was larger than my main dish salad.  My first visits salad was the something or other Blue. Although the taste was good, the portion was extremely lacking in size.  On our second visit, I had the Ceasar and again the size of the salad is waaaaaay too small to be considered a main dish, not to mention the price they are charging for such a small amount of food!  One person in our party got the burger with fries and that looked to be good and enough food on the plate. Both of us that got the salads left very hungry.  Disappointed. I wanted to like this place and give it a good review."}
{"text":"A friend of my wife and mine recommended this place to us saying that the meatloaf sandwich was wonderful.  I'm always looking for something 'new' and different so after my wife had her hair done next door to the Amuse, we decided that because we were in the neighborhood, we'd give it a try.  The placed looked nice, it was small, clean and we were the only customers in the place at about 1:00PM.  There was an elderly man there (I think he was related to the owners and he was baby sitting for a 5 yr old girl).  At any rate, he was not eating, just baby sitting.  The menu is sparse with only 6 featured items and then a few other items like a vegetarian sandwich and a soup of the day.  I wish I had taken the soup of the day (Creamed Green Chili) but unfortunately, I had the 1/2 lb hamburger called The Cabernet Burger because it's flavored with a Cabernet wine.  I'm sure that a lot of people would like this burger but it just wasn't for me.  I'm not sure if there was too much wine in the burger or if the meat was just too greasy because the bottom half of the bun was soaked with something - either grease or wine oozing from the hamburger meat.  In all honesty, I did eat 1/2 of this huge monster of a burger and 1/2 of the fries - that would be the half that weren't overly deep fried and hard as wood.  My wife had the Quiche Lorraine that comes with a salad and was supposed to have balsamic vinaigrette but to me, it looked like they forgot to add the dressing or if it was supposed to be on the side and they forgot to bring the dressing with the meal.  My wife passed on eating the quiche because it was a little runny for her taste.  Quiche has to be baked for about a half an hour and then it has to set for a little while before being cut and served. It is my guess that this quiche was baked much earlier in the day and then left out under a heat lamp.  It looked like the egg / custard mix was starting to 'melt' and as it did, the crust began to get soggy.    So, we paid about $22 bucks for half a burger a dry salad and a glass of tea.  Unlike our friend that recommended the Amuse to us, I will steer our friends away from this not so good place."}
{"text":"Amazing! I came here for brunch on Sunday. It is an extremely small space, so when you walk in you are right there (slightly intimidating when everyone turns to stare!). But once seated it was so good. The service is the friendliest I've seen, with multiple servers all helping out each table. I like that it's BYOB and so we brought some bubbly. There is a glass charge of $3 but well worth it since no corking fee.  The beignets are a MUST try! WOW! We all had the benedict, but I can't wait to go back and try everything else! An absolutely perfect Sunday brunch!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dessert.  Was craving a dark chocolate tart.  The rich dark chocolate was good, but I'm not sure I would get it again.  The crust was very average.  Perhaps the restaurant's culinary forte is in the entrees.  I was looking forward to trying out the dinners next time, but am not sure I will return.  I mentioned as we were being seated that we were there for dessert.  The waiter just seated us without a menu, brought water and left.  Then he walked by and said he would be with us in a bit.  He came back & proceeded to set the table with a fork, spoon, and knife.  I mentioned to him that we had wanted dessert only.  He said he knew, and then proceeded to rattle off the desserts quickly.  The waiter came across as edgy, somewhat annoyed, and not wanting to be there.  For wanting to be an upscale bistro, I found the attitude of service to be unacceptable.  I am more than willing to pay for great food and/or service, but this place disappointed me enough to make me not want to come back."}
{"text":"My understanding is that Amuse Bouche closed for a while to morph into a larger restaurant with longer hours. Was thinking I might check it out again--as I thought there was also going to be new ownership--until reading most recent reviews. I ate there twice, pre-expansion. Previous incarnation had great food, but it was way too slow in getting to the table. European-style dining is one thing; this was ridiculous. Also, waitstaff was awful. Not especially friendly nor accommodating. Who insists on a \"split plate\" charge when each of you is ordering a similar meal, and you just want to swap for the other's half sandwich? It was explained that was a house policy, but screw that! That last annoyance was enough to keep me from returning after that visit. Hope ownership decides it wants to keep and grow the clientele because I certainly won't return if these issues are still issues."}
{"text":"Really good place for breakfast here in surprise. I asked if they had Mimosas and they said they didn't serve but that I could bring My own Champagne. Great Idea next time I come I sure will remember to bring it. Food here is really good."}
{"text":"We have frequented this restaurant many times when it was owned by someone else. We were unsure of the new owner but took some out-of-town guests there. It did not disappoint. Our appetizers which were frites, mussels, and bruschetta were all out of this world delicious. All of our entrees were delicious as well. We shared the homemade bread pudding which was sinful. Kudo's to the new owner/chef. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had Christmas Eve dinner and the food was very good.  It was a fixed menu which facilitated the good service.  We have been there before and will certainly return again."}
{"text":"We stopped in this small bistro while visiting with family in Arizona.  Based upon the Yelp reviews, I was intrigued and want to check it out for lunch.  First of all, it is very tiny, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=T26UYP8c20EJZacTFySeFQ I'd say they could seat maybe 40-50 people max inside the restaurant and on the outdoor patio.    The lunch menu offered appetizers, salads, house specialties and paninis.  I decided to order one of the house specialties which was the Cabernet Burger. Wow, is all I can say about this burger.  I don't think I have ever had a hamburger flavored with wine before.  It was a half pound of red wine-infused beef goodness.  There was white cheddar, bacon jam and garlic aioli on the burger that just added to the awesome flavor.  It was very good.  Our table also decided on the another house specialty which was the Paris Baguette sandwich.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=qTkDfiKalJ5zmmc4SQnIxg  Of course, I sampled this, also for Yelp reviewing purposes ;)  It was delicious.  It had Black Forest Ham, brie, Dijon aioli, hard-boiled eggs and tomato.  It was accompanied by a field green salad.  Lastly, we got the Black Forest Ham Panini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/amuse-bouche-surprise?select=f2sVvmOb3YfEOljygqSgBg  This was a very flavorful panini.  Upon tasting this, we almost thought it resembled a Monte Cristo because of the richness.  It had Swiss cheese, tomatoes and Dijon aioli on it.  I think what made all three of these things we ordered really terrific was the fresh bread they were all prepared on.    Service was friendly and helpful.  They were very busy when we visited and our waitress was tending to a lot by herself, it seemed.  I would have never known about this place, if it weren't for Yelp.  Glad to have found this little great hidden gem tucked away in shopping center in Surprise."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and both times have been on Sunday's. Excellent food both times and we will be back for sure! The beignets are amazing as well as the Eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant, lovely little surprise.  What a nice way to have lunch after a day of exploring out west.  Although small and in a strip mall, once inside you are in a charming red \"bistroish \"  cafe. The style is warm and the food is delicious.   I  highly recommend the Lamb Panini  super good, moist  and flavorful.  The Fish And Chips special was tasty too. The fish and fries both appeared to be beer battered .  Generous portions and great taste. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Amuse Bouche recently then YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO AMUSE BOUCHE.  Amuse Bouche recently was sold and ownership and the chefs have changed. This is also no longer a B.Y.O.B. Restaurant. They now have a liquor license and a bar to seat people. The restaurant has a NEW modern decor and has doubled in size and now has an enclosed patio.  They started us off with an Amuse Bouche of a stuffed mushroom cap and assorted HOT Breads with butter.  We started with the Risotto Fritters. The rice was a little overcooked but the flavors were outstanding and perfect. A tasty dish.  For Dinner I had the Grouper Special. The Grouper was stunning...It's a difficult fish to prepare and is unforgiving. The Grouper just melted in my mouth and I really enjoyed the Spiced Honey Orange Glaze with it. I did think the rice and slaw that came with it were a little too neutral in flavor but I really enjoyed the fish.  My husband tried the Beef Bourguignon. I heard it was mostly good. A few pieces were dry but the potatoes were rich and yummy.  We thought the Bananas Foster would be fun to try. We both really loved the bananas in it and the crepe....I hate to be picky but we thought someone might have slipped with the sugar in the fresh whipped cream because it was cloyingly sweet (and I really LOVE sweets). We both also thought the caramel had a burnt taste....not perfect ......  Our server was efficient.  I feel my experience was a 3.5 star. We both thought pricing was reasonable for what we had. I rounded up because the good was more a four than a three.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"It's a small world indeed.   This is a family run business and this review is for the catering service and the incredible food and for the amazing owners, Snir and Kierstin Mor. Why do I say it's a small world? Well, Kierstin happens to be from San Ramon. Yep, of all the Bay Area, a San Ramon person catering the first night of Shiva in honor of my Grandmother in Sun City, Arizona and the restaurant is in Surprise. Small world indeed.  Jewish rituals around death are to some very hard to deal with and can be very complicated. Due to the fact my Gram had been living near me for the past year but still had her residence in Sun City and due to proximity of the mortuary and cemetery and other factors, my Mom and I decided to use a caterer to ensure we had enough food for everyone who may come for Shiva( traditionally everyone who attends the graveside would attend) My mom still being a local had been to their restaurant and had contacted them when we knew my Grandmother's death was imminent. We were and still are very grateful that Snir understood without question that we couldn't give him a set date or time just a heads up and a basic idea of timing and what our needs were and where the Shiva would be taking place.  How can one review the food for what gentiles would consider a wake? Well, my feeling is how could I not. I'm Jewish- I like to eat. I like to talk about food. I like to cook food (someday will get my groove back with this)- The food was seriously THAT GOOD. Snir and Kierstin were THAT GREAT and luckily we ordered more than needed as we ended up needing to serve the leftovers the following evening and it fed me for another couple of days.   I can honestly say Snir made the absolute BEST quiche I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of quiche in my life. First of all, I am still amazed at how he was able to cater quiche that was so light, so layered and so perfectly executed.  I have dreams about this quiche (and due to the eating my feelings since my Gram's passing the dream part is no exaggeration). We also had 2 different phenomenal vegetarian lasagnas one with eggplant one with olives, a couple of different salads- one with kale and quinoa and one with candied nuts The dressing was amazing. The rolls were great and lastly the lemon bars (no left overs) and the pot de creme(too rich for my taste buds but everyone raved about them) were a nice way to end a hard day on a sweet note.     I will say that if I lived in the area and needed catering, this would be my go to caterer. I wished I could have had the opportunity to to their actual restaurant but I know that day may come. Knowing that the restaurant is in Surprise, I am certain that all of the chain restaurants around may overshadow the gem but I sure hope not.   Toda Raba!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute. It's small but has an outside area as well so that helps. It's very Parisian which I love. The menu is smaller so you know it's gotta be authentic! Unfortunately I didn't really like what I got. It's nothing towards them I just don't think my taste buds enjoyed it. There was something on the sand which that made me question it. I honestly thought it was fish but I think it was the type of cheese. It might have been Gouda cheese or something. It was good but I think because there was a lot of it, I just couldn't enjoy it. It was too much for me. The idea of the sandwich was really good though. I'd like to come back and try it again. They were pretty quick at bringing the food out. I also know they have coffee here so I'd like to try that the next time I come here so hopefully soon! It's not a bad place otherwise!"}
{"text":"Wow! Never knew this place even existed. Stopped by here only to try their burger! Yes a burger at a Frenchie restaurant! Probably one of my favorite burger of all-time!!! The Cabernet Burger!!! This puppy has a 1/2lb beef patty flavored with Cabernet wine, Swiss cheese, bacon jam, caramelized onions, served with French fries. I'm at that age when I am trying different thing in food. And am I glad I tried this. Since I am only a few blocks away from here, this is where I will be getting my burger from. Not sure if the family will like this place. Wife and daughter are pretty much safe on food. I will like to come back and try other things here soon."}
{"text":"WOW! What a dining experience:-)  Don't let the small room in an out of the way strip mall fool you.  This place has big flavor in all it's dishes.  I had the rack of lamb. Tasted more like a miniature prime rib!!! No hint of any gamy flavor which lamb can have.  Also, you must have dessert and make it the bread pudding.  As good as Commanders Palace in New Orleans, and that's the best I've had...until now.   And bring your own bottle of wine.  They don't have a liquor license, but will open any you bring.  Feel free to call ahead to ask for suggested wines for for the options on the menu.  If you're in Phoenix, this is place is a must.  I've heard their burgers are great, but will have to wait until my next visit to report on this one."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous restaurant!  We went there for their brunch on Sunday.  There were 3 of us and we each ordered different things and shared.  I got the Eggs Benedict. OMG it was so delicious!  The egg was cooked perfectly.  The ham was phenomenal.  The English Muffin was toasted just right and all of this was drowned in the most amazing hollandaise sauce I've ever had.  We also had the waffle that was very nice and we also had the fresh baked croissants with tiny pearls of cold butter.  YUM!  The breakfast bread pudding was sweet, sticky, and tasty!  We also had the beignets (can you tell we love carbs?!) that were a bit heavy but went very well with the coffee.  I wish I lived in AZ so we could go here all the time but alas we do not."}
{"text":"So happy for Chef/owner John!  What a fantastic restaurant.  The remodel is beautiful and the food and service are all 5 stars!  We have had great meals here and it has become our favorite restaurant.   We had a private social here recently with our wine club, and they went above and beyond, to make everyone happy! The food was outstanding and delicious.  Great wine list, plus they have a full bar for cocktails too.  Do yourself a favor, and go see for yourself....Amuse Bouche is wonderful!  Bob Appetit!!  Jojo & Dick"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful.  We shared the Meatloaf sandwich and the Caprese. I will definitely  return.  Would love to try the Eggs Benedict next time.    Compliments to the Chef."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  We like to dine here during special occasions (anniversary, birthday, etc)  Their eggs benedict are the best I have ever had! The restaurant is very small, but they do take reservations."}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant can easily win your heart over with its food. This restaurant was also featured in Phoenix magazine, and that's how I found out about it... You have to try the quiche at least once when you are here. The candied pecans are an unexpected surprise with the swiss cheese and bacon mixed inside the quiche. They are also known for their burgers, so I tried the Cabernet burger, which was absolutely delicious! It's very filling at 1/2 lbs of burgerness!  I also tried the pate for the first time ever. It was served with toasted bread. I'm not the biggest fan of pate after finally trying it, but my husband loved the creamy texture and pungent flavor of the pate and now compares other pates to this one.  There are several different kind of paninis available too. If you come with a friend, the paninis seem big enough to split. The lamb panini that I tried had a more gamey taste to it. Fortunately, there was cheese and other toppings that helped balance that strong flavor out. I might just settle for a pork panini next time  for a milder flavor.  The restaurant itself is not very big. I came here once during the week with coworkers and the six of us sat outside on the patio. The restaurant can get really packed, so it's good that there is patio seating for more options, because it's less crowded on the patio versus indoors. If you're in the mood for a French bistro restaurant, definitely don't hesitate to come try here. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Well it was not a good experience. We went there for lunch. Waited over 1 hour for our food finally had to ask for it to be packaged to go. Terrible service and the waitress apologized too. The kitchen staff needs to figure out how to get the food out to customers faster. Probably won't being going back."}
{"text":"This is truly a French bistro in the little desert town of Surprise. Everything was Delish."}
{"text":"Great little bistro, we each ordered the Cabernet Burger, not all burgers are created equal! Treat yourself.  Outdoor seating was nice and very quiet and very relaxing."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  My daughter and I shared a sandwich.  Though it does state in small print that there is $3 split fee most restaurants verbally advise you of that up front.  We were also asked if we wanted blue cheese on our salad.  We said yes not realizing until the check arrived that there was an additional charge for that as well.  Tables are very close together affording little privacy.  Food was average."}
{"text":"LIkely the only reason I do not give this little gem five stars is the strip mall ambience of the place. The food is fresh, delicious, and wonderfully presented. Have not tried dinner...at bit pricey for me, but breakfast and lunch menus are small and delightful. They are very helpful if you are taking an older person who has rather picky taste (just eggs and english muffin please). Their crepes are to die for, all the soups have been rich and creamy, the bread tastes home baked. If you want New Orleans style pastry..Sunday is your day. We are now regulars."}
{"text":"Just went here for a Valentine's Day lunch. Service was good, atmosphere was ok. The food was fabulous, got Quiche Lorraine, Lamb Panini and Cabernet Burger. Will definitely order the Quiche and the Burger, but not the Lamb Panini. It's nice to have a place close by where the food is really good."}
{"text":"The 4 of us had dinner one night. With tip it was about 85.  Pros: The food quality was excellent The service was great The bread was delicious  Cons: This is a byob restaurant and there is a corking fee The portions could be bigger. My father and law and I had the meatloaf and while it was great, for $15, I expected more than 2 pieces on a small bed of mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"After reading the \"Best of Phoenix Awards\", I had to try Amuse Bouche.  When I read the article and saw something about it in one of the Yelp talk threads I thought ~ \"What is this, a French restaurant located on the west side that is actually good?\"    Well I gave it two chances for my first visit was a 1-2 star experience and my second visit was better but not enough to raise my rating...    First experience ~ I wanted to try the \"Best Quiche Lorraine in Phoenix\".  What I got was a so-so swiss and bacon quiche that was runny and not evenly cooked.  The pie crust was exceptional but when I pointed out the runniness of the quiche to my server she stated \"that's how it's cooked\".  My quiche came with a side salad for which I was asked if I wanted some blue cheese crumbles on top and of course I agreed.  I did not know it was going to cost me an additional $1 for what should have been on top of the salad to begin with...  The salad was fresh, the candied pecans were good but the salad needed more dressing.  (see pic)  Aside from the runny quiche the service was deplorable.  Loud 80's big hair band rock was coming from the kitchen area and filtered through this little \"French Restaurant\". My server did not know her menu and stated that my quiche was egg-less when I pointed out it was too runny.  My ice tea ran dry a couple of times due to my server and the cook eating in the kitchen.  It was somewhat gross because they were cooking other peeps meals while eating theirs... No hand washing in between, yeeuuh!    Second visit ~ I made sure no one in the kitchen area was eating and cooking at the same time.  I was also glad to get a different server this on visit even though I could not believe the other lame-o server was still there.  This server knew the menu very well and was very attentive with his service.  After reading the Yelp reviews I tried their Cabernet Burger.  It was more cabernet than burger...  You could not taste the beef and the caramelized onions made this burger too mushy for which the bun could not hold up to it.  The French fries were pre-frozen and were not good even with the onion aioli...  I had HIGH hopes for this west side French Bistro but their food and service fell flat like a French Beret..."}
{"text":"Wow, so glad we happened upon this place the other day. Tiny menu, but it's all done right. Tiny bistro, but I like it. Waitresses were wonderful, so kind, responsive, and accommodating. Food came out fresh and fast. We each tried a different kind of eggs Benedict and WOW. Like seriously, it was the best eggs benedict we've all had. I think it was the hollandaise, there was so much flavor! Potatoes were excellent. Coffee was fresh. We're coming back to this one."}
{"text":"We this restaurant might have great food but not very nice hostess or owner.  We stop to make a reservation in the afternoon for a specific table and when we arrived they had just sat someone at the table. The only table let was by the bathroom or at the door really not nice places to sit for an expensive dinner. Off my list of restaurants to recommend I the Surprise Area"}
{"text":"Seriously the best waffles i've ever had in my life. I really like this place, and i'll definitely be back. I almost didn't go here because of all the reviews that said how few and far between the seating was. I was happily surprised to see it's really not that small. I was expecting 2 or 3 tables by some people's descriptions, but it was much more than that. It was a normal size sit down cafe. And i'm very thankful for its location as there is not much quality food out in this area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Can I take one star off because I don't live near enough to this place? We had the Risotto Fritters which were tasty little fried rice balls paired with a delicious dipping sauce. I had the Cabernet Burger that was so rich, sweet, and perfectly cooked. My wife had the special Quiche Lorraine which was the creamiest quiche we've ever tasted. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes. Great atmosphere and friendly service!"}
{"text":"When the Mama was in town we needed to grab lunch while running errands, so we came here... I had been dying to try it, a good place to eat out here is kinda rare. I ordered the pork loin panini and the Ma ordered the Parisian baguette sandwich. Both came with a small side green salad with candied pecans and some kind of creamy vinaigrette dressing. The dressing wasn't amazing, but it was good, so hence the salad was good. I felt like the dressing had potential to be better, just a re-work of the recipe would do the trick. The pork loin panini was really good, I would order it again, but probably never actually will because after trying my Mom's sandwich, I will be stuck on it! It was soooooooooo amazing!   We ordered take out, but the waiter was still very kind and patient, he gave us some waters and let us sit at the table while we waited, so that was nice. =) I am so glad to have this place out here!"}
{"text":"Ah yes Amuse Bouche, is the GOAT. Very great environment and the servers are comforting. Ive had many Cubanos before in the valley and this is by far the best prepared and tasting. I will definitely be coming back soon, then again. You will not go wrong eating here boi.  -the great Anthony L"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the lunch menu. I had a French Dip, salad, and French Onion Soup. The soup was good, salad was ok. The French Dip was more like a shredded pot roast sandwich. I was expecting thinly sliced beef (a distinct difference from pot roast). Maybe we'll try the dinner (after 3:00 menu) next time."}
{"text":"The place is small, but welcoming and clean. However, aside from the name there is little French about it. The menu is very limited. It consists mainly of Fish & Chips (British), Pannini/Sandwiches (Italian), Salads of different descriptions (International), Pasta (Italian), Hamburgers (American), Onion Soup and Moules Mariniere (both French). Varied Desserts. We chose Moules Mariniere, described as PEI mussels, but looked like and tasted like rock mussels, in a bland white butter sauce served in an ice cold dish. Big faux pas. This included a side dish of French Fries, something odd, and unique, since this dish is usually served with French bread. Being from Europe we thought this to be a bit eccentric. The price of $15 for this dish was a bit on the high side for the place. Nice try, but no cigar. Obviously, will not be returning."}
{"text":"The staff was helpful and the restaurant was immaculate.  We went for lunch on a weekday so just a few customers. I had a small salad and found it fresh and yummy.  I added chicken for some extra protein.  My friend ordered French onion soup and said it was wonderful.  It is a little pricy as I only got the small salad and tea and paid $20 with tip.  Overall, I'd recommend this local restaurant."}
{"text":"What a little hidden gem in Surprise ! It's tiny like bistro in Europe and the quiche is to die for.  My girlfriend had the special of the day, a veal dish on spaetzle and she was raving about it! And we were told we could bring our own wine when we come in, that we love. The servers were fast and friendly , the kitchen takes a little times as I'm guessing it's made from scratch, oh but so worth it. Can't wait to come for one of the four course meals in a few weeks. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We'd been enjoying semi-annual outdoor Sunday brunches here for years. My husband always got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and for me the quiche lorraine. Plus we loved their beignets. A few years ago I began feeling increasing concern for the servers, getting the impression this is an especially difficult place to work.  This morning was our last time. Our table as well as several others were simply ignored for long periods of time. We saw people waiting 45 minutes for coffee. Plus, I'm socially sensitive and the west valley vibe of often very judgmental folks way too keen on being all into each other's business always was something that forced me to do spiritual work on myself the whole time."}
{"text":"What a difference good customer service makes!!  For my second visit I took my with daughter with me.  I called before heading over to make sure they had room for us. The person who answered the phone was friendly, improvement right off the bat!  When we arrived we were immediately greeted kindly & given an option of 2 tables that were open. The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :)   The food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas. The lemonade was a big hit :)  The entire experience, like the fries, was perfect & we both can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch. Reviews were good so we had high hopes. We had reservations and were seated right away. It took quite a while for a waitress to come over and take our order. At least five different wait staff brought things to our table during the course of the meal and they all seemed confused and didn't know what we had ordered. We ordered iced tea, coffee and water to drink. We got the iced tea and coffee pretty quickly brought by someone else. Had to flag someone down and ask for the water again. The coffee was very good. We ordered beneigts to start, eggs Benedict and a Belgian waffle and a side of scrambled eggs. The beneigts came pretty timely and were fresh and tasty. We waited a very long time for the rest. A different I waitress brought the waffle and eggs Benedict to the table. No side of scrambled eggs and no syrup for the waffle. We mentioned the missing items. It was very strange but the eggs Benedict was ICE cold as if it had been in a refrigerator (yes it was THAT cold) and the egg yolks were over cooked like a hard boiled egg. The waffle was also cold and soggy. When a waitress came with the scrambled eggs (and still no syrup) we asked her to please send our dishes back as they were cold. She took them away. We got refills on our coffee and iced tea. Funny thing is that the iced tea refill was some kind of hibiscus minty tasting tea, not what we first had. That's when our original waitress put the bill on the table. We told her what had happened and that we hadn't eaten yet. We asked her to please just charge us for the beneigts, coffee and iced tea so that we could leave because we had already waited a very long time and didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. She apologized and said she would let her boss know. All of the wait staff seemed frenzied. While we were waiting for our adjusted bill here came another eggs Benedict and waffle. We were surprised but figured we'd go ahead and eat and just pay our full bill. We again had to ask for syrup as it had never been brought to the table. Just then a nice man came to our table to apologize about the cold food and wanted to make sure it was hot this time. I took a bite of the eggs Benedict and said yes, thank you, it seems to be fine this time. It was warm this time and the eggs were cooked properly but it wasn't very flavorful. I didn't finish it because quite frankly it was rather bland and I had filled up on the three cups of coffee I drank while waiting for our food. I noticed my husband wasn't eating the waffle and asked him what was wrong. He said it was warm this time but it was soggy and not crisp as a Belgian waffle should be. He ate about 1/8 of the waffle. At this point we sort of gave up and placed our plates away from us and just waited for the bill. No one ever came back to the table to see if the food was good other than the one man who wanted to know if it was warm this time. Yet another different waiter came to the table and took the plates of uneaten food without noticing we didn't eat it or asking why we didn't eat it. We waited about 15 minutes trying to get the bill and couldn't even find our original waitress. Then the nice man came over to our table and apologized again and said that he was comping the meal. We told him about the mushy waffle and that the wait staff seemed confused and chaotic. He apologized again and said they needed to work on training. Everyone was very nice but the service was very bad and the bulk of our meal was disappointing. I don't know if this is how it always is here or they were just unorganized because it was Mother's Day?  Wait staff should be assigned a section of a restaurant and attend to those table's needs but that for sure was not happening here. It wasn't a special menu for the day just the brunch one they always have listed online. It was our first time here and I would have been very embarrassed if I had brought guests here but since it was just my husband and I, and I had chosen the restaurant for my Mother's Day meal I just shrugged it off, left a tip and didn't let it ruin my day. We heard staff saying they had a new owner. I hope they get it all worked out because it looks based on former reviews that it used to be a good place to dine. They did comp our meal which was the right thing to do thus the two star rating instead of one star."}
{"text":"We loved Amuse Bouche! We visited for dinner. Everything we had was superb! We had the Hummus, Cauliflower-Truffle Oil Soup, Meatloaf Platter and the most amazing Pot Pie with Crawfish and Sausage. Even their bread rolls were amazing. The service was too! I can't say enough! We had a great experience, and we will definitely be back! We must try their Brunch and their Desserts.  NOTE: Make sure to make a reservation . The restaurant is small (quaint/nice/no frills)."}
{"text":"We went to try this place out again since we heard  they have remodeled and now have a bar. The food was very good, a little overpriced for Surprise but I don't mind paying for quality. I paid $18 for a crepe that was essentially an egg and  bacon burrito with a cheese sauce and a side of potatoes and mixed greens. The reason why this is not a 4 star review is because of the service. Our reservation was at 8:45 and it took about 45 minutes before we got to order. They need need to get rid of the geriatric wait staff here. I know they are the staff from the previous ownership, which is why we stopped going. The previous owners were great, but we were always hesitant to go because service was so bad. We got the same server as last time and once again she pulled the same shit. She took 30 minutes just to take our drink order. We ordered 2 bottles of champagne and a carafe of orange juice. She never brought ice buckets, made us open our own bottles and forgot the orange juice for another 10 minutes. Once she took our order she had to come back 15 minutes after our order was originally taken to ask us what we ordered again because supposedly the pos system sent it to the wrong printer? She never asked if we wanted more champagne after we finished our bottles. We would have ordered 2 more, so the restaurant lost on that one. She was nice though and kept apologizing for her service. As a fellow Surprise business owner I want to see this place succeed, but they will have a hard time if they don't work on getting a better staff. I have personally employed two of their staff members, one of their cooks twice actually. (he starts of great but will continually call out and then eventually stop showing up.) I hope the new owner reads this. It's going to be hard competing with places like Vogue and State 48 if you don't improve from.the previous  business. The owners were not doing well and that's why they obviously sold it. So if you just keep the same staff and same menu, why do you think you will succeed? Surprise is a rough crowd. I will give them a second and third chance to change this review because I am rooting for them. Update the menu, maybe play some music, decorate the place a little, hire professional servers and you might be one of the top restaurants in Surprise."}
{"text":"If you live in Surprise you know that there are not many good dining options.  Well this unique French place is top-notch, we have desert and the blueberry bread pudding was out of this world.  Will try entree's soon but great start"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall is so much fun! I brought my mother here for birthday brunch, and brought a bottle of cheap champagne for mimosas. They pop it open for you and give you a pitcher of orange juice for self-pour. I had the lamb panini, and it was absolutely fantastic. Seriously, the onions were sweet and plentiful and the lamb was cooked to perfection. Amuse Bouche was a great restaurant with awesome service and food - we will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"We have always meant to try Amuse Bouche, but the idea of a crowd always turned us away. We stopped in on Sat for a late lunch/early dinner and the place was dead! I had the Cabernet burger. Really tasty and totally different than any other hamburger I have had. The taste of the wine really came through and the onion aoili was a nice touch. I wish the bun was different though, tasted good but pretty much fell apart. The husband had the meatloaf sandwich and really enjoyed it, he did wish that he had fried instead of the side salad though.  The waitress was sweet and excited to find out that we were Surprise residents and asked us to come back, especially during the summer, since the snow bird crowd is now thinning out. It sounds like breakfast they may be packed, but I would love to try it out, and I am curious to see what dinner specials they run."}
{"text":"We started with three cheeses accompanied by fig chutney and wild honey ($6 ea). I then had the beet salad ($8) with goat cheese and candied pecans. The beets were prepared wonderfully. My wife & daughter had the artichoke and green chili bisque. This soup was unlike any soup I've ever tasted. You have to come here for the soup if you don't try anything else. You'll want try more food though. Trust me.  For our entrees my daughter & I had the pan seared duck with a lemon risotto crepe ($27). My wife had the fried chicken & cole slaw ($16?). Both were fantastic.  The service was great as well. The fact this place is a BYOB is just the icing on the cake.  Oh, by the way, go for their Sunday brunch too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't normally understand the hype around burgers - you've had one you've had them all - that is until I had their speciality Cabernet Burger. It's a 1/2 pound beef patty flavored with cabernet wine, topped with swiss cheese, bacon jam, caramelized onions and onion aioli served with some of the most phenomenal french fries I have had in some time! The paninis were insane as well, crispy and really flavorful!  Service was great - drinks were never empty and waiters were friendly.  The decor is cute and french themed. Worth checking out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Great food. Make a reservation because they fill up fast but we were able to get in for Sunday breakfast luckily. Small town feel but high class taste. Bring your own alcohol also helps and we will do next time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! When I go out to dinner I expect to have dinner NOT LUNCH! Beyond disappointed. We will not go back until the menu changes .......which apparently is based on snowbird population (stated by staff....Dec or Jan)"}
{"text":"What a joke! You'd better make a reservation. If you walk up and put your name on the list they will continue to take reservations over the phone and seat those people before you. I've never heard of treating your walk in customers so bad. Such a disappointment as the food reviews are great. An hour and 45 minutes is absurd when you are told 1 hour. Also the fsct that the staff would make comments on a customer within earshot. Totally unprofessional"}
{"text":"My all-time FAVORITE soup in the universe!!!  Butternut Squash soup at Amuse Bouche. The Caprese Panini is the bomb too!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the catering I had the pleasure of enjoying recently at a reception.  I had heard about the food here through my girlfriend, whose Aunt was a HUGE fan of Amuse Bouche.  They had Amuse, cater the reception for her celebration of life and I was certainly impressed!  The food was fresh and delicious, it was obvious they put a lot of love into the preparation.  We had fantastic seasoned shrimp, crab cakes, salmon mousse, grilled vegetable antipasti, croissant sandwiches, fresh hummus, and brie.  For dessert, we had eclairs, lemon tarts and macaroons.  I had two of each dessert to figure out which I liked best... normally a gal who would definitely be into eclairs all the way I found myself loving the lemon tart - WOW.  If I were up in the area again for any reason, I would definitely stop in and try a meal here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Quiche Lorraine & Meatloaf Sandwich. Nice little intimate gem in Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch spot!  We chose Amuse Bouche for our anniversary lunch this year and wow!  The intimate setting and the service first of all were top notch. We both ordered the infamous Cabernet burger. Heaven on a bun!  My husband has even taken some visiting work associates (used to dining at top Scottsdale eateries) in the past and everyone unanimously agrees with us - best burger ever!  The fries are also fabulous. Wish we could have stuck around for dessert but unfortunately we had an emergency come up and had to dash before having the pleasure. That will need to be rectified sometime soon on a return trip."}
{"text":"crap quick-bake pillsbury \"baked to order\". Croissant is NOT supposed to be gooey inside. Whatever expeller-pressed oil infused chemical it uses to achieve the \"buttery\" flakiness of the outer crust, you didn't fool me.  [this is my second attempt at this review. i would *swear* my april review with pictures was well placed, but it has since disappeared.]  I was so excited to try this place after reading the accolades and seeing some of the reviews here. I was sorely mistaken. echoing my bobblehead (and filtered) fellow-yelper's review, this place thinks *way* too high of itself. drop the attitude folks.  CROISSANT. # is not supposed to be gooey inside. it was for fakers.  POTATOES # margarine or expeller-pressed lube is the standard here. ugh. and to think we used to eat this stuff without blinking. for shame.  SERVICE. server keeps stopping at my table to see what else i want. every few seconds it seems. then they drop the check. before i asked. ok, i'm not going to fuss. unwilling to be shooed, i leave it. then she whisks it away, returning seconds later to scold me because there's no payment inside. OK OK I get it, I'm leaving!"}
{"text":"We are impressed! First visit to Amuse Bouche this afternoon. We were too early for the dinner menu but the lunch selection suited us just fine.   We gave the duck liver pâté a try as we have never had pâté presented on its own... No doubt whatsoever that this was excellent but it is clearly an acquired taste and we have not acquired it! The toasted, sliced baguette it came with, however, was fabulous and downright tasty with the simple house salad served with the pâté.  Given that Amuse Bouch is known and acclaimed for their Cabernet burger, that was our entree. It was everything described; thick, rich, moist, sweet, flavorful. The braised, candied onions with a wee bit of bacon was a wonderful contrast against the tangy cheese and bold beef. The ciabatta bun was a light, yet sturdy, vessel for the juicy burger.  The fries, oh the fries! Thank you for knowing how to make a fry that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... Note I said crispy, not burnt, and tender, not mushy. They were fries, not a pre-cut baked potato... Yummy!  This was a meal that we will crave again, it was positively memorable, and will bring us back! Bonus, they asked about every aspect of our meal and upon learning we did not have the taste for pâté, removed it from our bill... This is over-the-top customer service as we had ate at least 25% of it and it was our personal experiment (as in not their problem we didn't fall in love with it).  They lost a star due to the very small tables and a more eat-in kitchen ambiance than boutique bistro (which is what the name, menu, and color scheme suggested). But this issue won't keep us from coming back."}
{"text":"The breakfast was delicious! The beignets were so-so.  They were a little dry. I had the bacon and ham crepe (not pictured) and it was the perfect portion as well as delicious. The OJ mimosas had pulp in them which I really enjoyed. We did not have reservations and were given a little bit of a hard time but we were still seated.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I enjoyed Croque Monsieur, a black forest ham and guyere cheese sandwich with mornay sauce and salad.  Friends enjoyed the cabernet burger with fries, quiche, and the caprese pannini.  We shared dates/Manchego cheese wrapped in bacon that was amazing!  Do make sure you include dessert!  Pot of Creme (Chocolate Mousse) and Bread Pudding with Blueberries and Carmel Sauce!   We will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Amuse Bouche is a nice lil cafe. The staff is friendly. Service is prompt and the food is good. I tried their quinoa & kale salad w/ chicken and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not much else to say... Need a quick tasty bite, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Just had Sunday breakfast at Amuse Bouche.  Started out with the Beignets and coffee.  Then we both had the Eggs Benedict.  Excellent food and service albeit a tad too much, did take some home.   The service was second to none, neither was the food.  Hollandaise Sauce was perfect, the eggs done to a tee!  Just could not have been better."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast on the patio!  Bring your own champagne for mimosas!  Can't wait to go back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"We had a private .gathering at this place last night.  It was awesome.  The chef/owner Snir was terrific at explaining what we were going to be eating.  Our entrees were CoqAuVin and Beef Bourguigon,  also had  Tarte Flambé, and spring greens with a balsamic vinaigrette.  Dessert was Profiteroles, homemade cream puffs filled with vanilla ice cream and smothered in chocolate sauce.  Kierstin & Snir  co-owners were very gracious."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere!  Great service! The food is freshly prepared,  including freshly made pasta,  I had the special \" Fettuccine Alfredo\" with a generous portion of shrimp!!! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to visit this place last weekend. Food was good and I liked the menu options. We ordered beignets, and I will be honest, this is the first time I've ever had them so I don't really have a reference for comparison but I was not really impressed by them. The rest of the food was really good and the portions were perfect. The staff was very polite and our waiter made sure our coffee and water cups were full all the time.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"For most people in the valley this little bistro is to far away for them to dine at.  I'll give you a few reasons why should check this place out.  It's not far away from the Surprise baseball stadium, so it could be your choice to have lunch before a spring training game.  It is directly on your way by car to Vegas from Phoenix.  Or here's another reason, it really is worth the drive because how great the food is.  A very small place with about 20 seats so it's very quaint as you would expect.   Nicely decorated with a french flair and a large window looking directly into the kitchen.  So you get to see the chef in action!    On to the meal, the Cabernet Burger is one of the tastiest that I have ever had.  Marinated in cabernet sauvignon, topped with swiss cheese, applewood bacon, and carmelized onions.  The flavors ooze all over the bun and into your mouth.  Also comes with some delicately delicous fries.  A little crispy, but not to much, just the way I like it.  This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Who would have thought Surprise would have such a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"J'ai passé un super dîner ce soir, la nourriture était excellente, le service était excellent, l'atmosphère agréable. Bon soir"}
{"text":"Been there once. Never Again!  Hit me up for an extra $12.00 on the bill. $3 for xtra pita bread for the $10 dollar humus appetizer,  $3 bucks each for glasses we told the waitress we didn't want, and $3 for an extra plate that we didn't want. We split a seafood dinner for$30, too much fried chit. To top it off we were seated right next to the restroom so people were walking by us all night long. Left there pretty pised off. Only reason I even left a dam tip was because my date is a waitress and she shamed me into it. If I wasn't on a first, I would of said F_ _ k it, no tip. Waitress was no help at all. This place Sucked for me."}
{"text":"I didn't realize it had been so long since I worked in the area. I believed it had been six or seven years, but Kirsten said they have been open for nine years, and my first time here was a few months after they opened. I must tell you my sole reason for returning to Surprise was to eat at this restaurant. The first time there was no Trip Advisor (at least of which I was aware). We had wanted to go to a different joint that was closed. I stumbled upon this one. I almost want to call it a food boutique. Don't let the outside fool you. Yes this is a strip mall. I don't even know what else is sold here because once you zero in on Amuse Bouche, nothing else matters. If I had a babe, this would be the perfect place to bring her. Dinner with friends is a close second. But on to my story: Like I said, I hadn't been here in nine years. We played with the idea of coming (it was my agenda all along) but we are prey to ever changing work hours. When I called on Friday to get a reservation (duh), they were full. Saturday? Full. Sunday? No dinner served. In fact, they only serve dinner twice a week. A specialty dinner. I expressed my dismay and ended the call. A friend suggested that I have them call me should someone cancel. Brilliant! I did just that. Of course Chelsea remembered me from five minutes prior. Low and behold, I am just about to shut off my cell phone (a work requirement) when it rings. It is Chelsea from AB and they are going to squeeze my party in. 4:30, 8:30 or outside. No way for 4:30 and it has been getting nippy after sundown so 8:30 is perfect. I thank her profusely and gleefully look forward to the end of the work day.  On Fridays the menu is Prime Rib. Period. You pick the sides.  I'm not crazy about Prime Rib. But I would have eaten sautéed socks at this restaurant. So Prime Rib it is. We walk in and it comes back to me how intimately the inside sits. There are approximately ten tables. To the right is a lovely Parisian mural painted over booths. To the left are wistful images of Joie de Vivre. My dinner companion watches the kitchen produce its magic while my view is of some drive-through something. The person who seated us was the owner Kirsten, and she has a show with her waitress Sally that she should take on the road. Of the Abbot & Costello ilk, they were like unmarried Lucy and Desi, and hilarious. We had been told beforehand that this is a BYOB place, so I had a bottle with me. $3 charge for providing the glass. A great deal if you ask me. So yeah, Prime Rib. With a twist. Turns out they prepare it Sous Vit which means the meat is vacuum packed, immersed in water to 130º, then an immersion circulator is put in that gently circulates the water. So it is prepared to exactly the degree of cooking that rocks your boat. It is finished in the oven for the crust that all PR consumers crave.  The sides were basic. Basically fantastic! For a starter I could definitely appreciate a nice organic salad containing field greens, candied almonds, crumbled blue cheese, bacon, with balsamic vinaigrette, but the idea of Roasted Cream of Green Chile soup spoke to me. Kirsten told us, when she wasn't cracking wise with Sally, that a lot of times people ask for soup recipes, but this soup was putting her four kids through college, so the offer was off the table. They will all be able to attend Ivy League schools. She also holds a cooking class here.  For my sides I chose Brussel sprouts, sautéed in butter and Cremini mushrooms in shallot & garlic, with a shot of Brandy. I already knew what I wanted for dessert but Kirsten wouldn't entertain it. My cohort chose potato gratin and green peas. The prime rib was also served with a Bordelaise demi-glaze and horseradish cream sauce. When returning with our uncorked bottle, Kirsten commented to the effect that she needed some good wine. I told her that she was welcome to have a glass. She intimated that that was a great idea.  I see this is getting long so I will cut to the chaise. The soup, just as Kirsten proclaimed, was life changing. Smooth and tender, if you can call soup that. Had little bits of corn in it. I don't know - maybe we can rob her for the recipe next visit. The rolls reminded me of Coco Bread that can be sampled in Bermuda. A little sweet. Nice and chewy. The prime rib was oh so tender, and the sides brought out the flavor of the meat perfectly. The sauce and horseradish cream made each bite a little bit of Heaven. The wine we brought, care of Nancy Baty of Hess Collection, perfectly complemented the meal. Thanks Bates! The meat was this huge, hunking piece, and I had dessert on my mind, so I didn't eat a whole lot. As the evening progressed. She served the last table's dessert before ours, and it was clear to me that Kirsten would take us up on our invitation. She sat for a glass of wine when the last other customers cleared out. Turns out she is from the Bay Area, just like me, and the three of us had a really nice California conversation. But fi"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. They have decent food. Husband got the meatloaf sandwich, which he raved about. It was $10.99. I got the \"Cabernet burger ($12)\" and the \"Quiche Lorraine ($9.50)\". The burger was not worth the price. The Quiche was good, but again, I had better quiche for half that price. The salad that comes with with the quiche is a spring salad mix and its very fresh. We'll come back here maybe twice a year when we don't know what else to eat."}
{"text":"Amuse Bouche is such a special place because Kiersten and Snir have such a beautiful vision for their work. They aim to comfort and delight with their cooking and that's exactly what they do.  They will cater my wedding on 12.31.16 and last night we had a tasting to try everything from appetizers to macaroons, paninis & soup to 10 hour braised chicken and beef. It was magical because love was put into every bite.  I'm so grateful for them and they have our support for life. Thank you Kiersten & Snir! Kim & Joe"}
{"text":"The Cabernet Burger is great! Excellent service. Gonna have to try the Sunday brunch some day, as I keep hearing rave reviews about it."}
{"text":"My two dear friends suggested this adorable small quaint cafe.  I have been back four times with my girlfriends.  To include I dragged my husband there and he was very  impressed with his lunch. Something for everyone start with the wrapped figs and end with the blueberry bread pudding.  YUM!  Also, remember to bring your own wine. The corking fee is super reasonable. Most  important Bella is one of the sweetest servers you will ever meet!  Ask her for a recommendation she knows the menu well!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and easily got seated.  I am originally from Columbus Ohio and we had many wonderful restaurants that are privately owned and have outstanding food.  I have not be overly fortunate to find good meals since moving to Phoenix three years ago.  I read some reviews and decided to stop by.  My son and I both enjoyed our lunch very much.  I had the Parisian Baguette and he had the Caprese with a side salad.  The salad doesn't have much dressing as is mentioned in other reviews but I didn't think it needed anymore than what was offered on it. The greens and candied pecans were fresh and full of flavor.  I think too many people are accustomed  to drowning their salads in dressing.  The sandwiches were very good.  You could actually smell the freshness of the tomato when the server set the plates down.  The flavors worked well together.  The only issue is the interior of the restaurant.  I have yet to be there in the evening but it would be nice if they put out the white tablecloths and had nice lighting to at least add to the experience.  They are working with what they have in the storefront so maybe in days to come they can get a venue that matches the quality of the food.  It's much better than the chains that surround the area.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a freaking fun little spot!    Our family had a great breakfast at this restaurant and service was very good.  The beignets were a hit with my daughter and wife.  Waffles were a perfect crisp on the edges and loaded on top with fruit and real whipped create.  Syrup tastes like cinnamon buns.  My wife's quiche was cooked to perfection with airy egg and perfectly infused cheese flavor.  And my crepe with ham and swiss cheese was amazingly tasty, large, and filling enough that I only ate half.  I wanted to finish it, I just couldn't    We'll be heading back and hoping to catch when they do their French Onion Soup...  One oddity: We had called ahead and were told they did not take reservations.  When we arrived and asked for a table, they asked if we had reservations.  Chatting with them, it sounds like they do take reservations in the winter/spring (snowbird season) and they apologized for any confusion.  Space is at a premium at this spot, so call ahead."}
{"text":"You simply must eat here. The food is amazing, service is excellent and it is just a nice place to eat. Remember, this is not fast food, but my wife and I love to sit and chat anyway. I highly recommend the quiche, the French onion soup, and their fresh greens salad is just want you want on a warm day. We love sitting in the outside area in nice weather and watching the world go by and pretend we are on the Rive Gauche. Also, the recent renovations really add to the whole experience. I would give a six if I could."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here. I would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction."}
{"text":"They just expand and we were very surprised, the place is very nice, service is excellent and the food is amazing!! Our favorite is egg Benedict and the waffles. You definitely need to try this place"}
{"text":"What a gem! I loved this place. The patio was a great atmosphere and the food was fantastic. It was worth the drive and we will be back with friends in tow!   We enjoyed the burger, the salmon salad, and the yummy chocolate dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is a must hit.  I had a Cabernet burger, and hands down its the best gormet style burger I've ever eaten.  It's messy, just ask for extra napkins, and don't mess with what it comes with.  As is, it's mix of flavors will soon make you disappointed with any other burger.  It's an unusual environment, as someone said earlier, it's a little intimidating when you walk in, but stay, sit, and enjoy.    My wife and I will be going back."}
{"text":"The Cowboy steak was so amazing tender you could cut it with a butter knife. The chicken Frances and croissants was amazing as well. Service was good. Nothing but accolades and praise! It was a perfect dinner."}
{"text":"A very delightful treat!  I had their filet mgnon and it was cooked to perfection.  It was served with their spectacular carrot butter and potatoes.  I highly recommend this bistro."}
{"text":"I had a 11-person brunch reservation today at this restaurant. They were a little late in getting us seated, but once we were the service was stellar! I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and it was delicious. Everyone else in my party also raved about their food. They came out every few minutes to make sure we were okay. They chilled the champagne I brought with me (gotta love BYOB), and you can't leave here without trying the bread pudding. We will definitely be going back. Nice to see the town of Surprise open up a local eatery with fantastic service and food. Who needs a chain restaurant when you have this place to go??"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch yesterday and ordered a Cabernet burger and fries and a creme brulee for dessert. The burger was outstanding, extremely juicy and flavorful. The fries were also outstanding. Creme brulee was pretty good, but in my opinion, they're hard to get wrong. Service was excellent, our waitress was quick on refilling out glasses and checking in to make sure everything was ok. The dining area is pretty cozy so if you're going during a rush hour, you may want to call ahead."}
{"text":"A friend and I came, for the first time, for lunch the other day.  What a delight!  It's a wee, tiny place with only twelve or so tables, but they also have outdoor tables.  One thing I loved is that there's enough room between tables, that one can have an easy, relaxed conversation with friends.  The decor was simple, but pleasant.  The staff was very attentive and helpful.    And the food was excellent.  My friend had the Quiche Lorraine with the side of greens and very much enjoyed it.  I had their special of a pork tenderloin panini with grilled onions and tomatoes with side greens.  The sandwich was DELICIOUS!    Amuse Bouche is definitely a restaurant to which I would return and recommend."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum YUM! Only been here for breakfast but we keep coming back again and again.  The eggs Benedict corned beef hash is so delicious. The beignets come out hot and I dream of eating them when I'm not there (think triangle doughnut with powdered sugar).  Everything made fresh. Need to stop writing review now so I can go make a reservation for this weekend."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Solid practiced technique. house made product. Excellent ingredients. I had the lamb Panini and cream of artichoke soup. Obviously that these Chefs are well trained and understand how a simple approach makes the best food. The severs were friendly but a little slow. I would return."}
{"text":"Finally got around to visiting the newly remodeled facility with new owners and sorry it took me so long as they have been open since March, Everything was great from start to finish: 1. Coffee/Tea was HOT and excellent 2. Beignets were very good, but could have been larger, a little more Light and puffy. But not a complaint just a suggestion 3. Eggs Benedict were Awesome with the best Hollandaise Sauce ever!  4. Great Staff and owner was out to check how everything went   Cannot wait to go back very soon as their Lunch Menu looks really good!"}
{"text":"Very small place but well design... Went there for lunch and was  very quiet... the soup of d Jour was very nice so the quiche. The cabernet burger was delicious but I was very disappointed with the lamb panini... very blend... I'm glad that I tried that place for lunch I'm not sure for dinner.  Not too bad but I'm no sure if I'll return :("}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews. Today I had the wife and child with me so I thought we would try a new place. Let me start by saying the location is good, the decor is simple but works for the style they are going for. This is where your fine dining experience will end. Normally when I spend over $50 for lunch I don't expect frozen meats and to hear a microwave cooking things constantly. Not the case here. The Cabernet burger was alright but nothing I'd write home about. The fries were good, but frozen. The special of the day was a fettuccine alfredo dish that was visually appealing but lacking in flavor. Bland and runny white sauce. The croissant appetizer is worth getting and they seemed to be made fresh. This was the highlight of the meal.  The service was prompt in the beginning but quickly faded as the restaurant filled to capacity. No real organization to it and seems like either one more server would help balance the load, but could also create an even bigger traffic jam.   Overall, 2 stars. Food was marginal, table service was as good as it could be. A nice concept but poorly executed."}
{"text":"Today on Father's Day, my husband and I went to AB for Sunday brunch and I was immediately anxious looking at the menu as a vegetarian.  So, first thing is first, I ordered a mimosa which was wonderful.  Then ordered the avocado toast which was really good.  Our server sent john bossmann, the head chef to our table as we had questions on vegetarian options.  John said \"I got you\".  Went into the kitchen and brought us a wonderful soy based beet patty treated with caramelized onions, peppers, tomatoes, and arugula. He then brought us an arugula salad with aged blue cheese and couscous. We finished with beignet and a huge hug to the owner.  He didn't act annoyed of our dietary restrictions, he actually appeared to have fun with the challenge and he sure delivered.  Surprise, AZ has very few original (non-chain) restaurants and am so happy to had the honor to enjoy this food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious  (shrimp scampi and bacon wrapped dates) and the service was top notch. The dining area is small and the portions are also on the small side but well worth the visit. I also recommend the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"My mouth was definitely amused.  And in a good way.  Before my visit I pictured a French style pretentious little place.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't go in with bad thoughts, that's just what came to mind with the name.  But when we walked in, the place and especially the people were anything BUT pretentious and the food was anything but just French.  Sure, there were the French staples like quiche and croissants...but then there was freshly made hummus, fritattas, paninis, and the biggest shocker, burnt ends sandwiches.  Not to mention a good selection of tempting desserts (oh yeah).  The owners were extremely nice and had the cutest little daughter with them that just made you laugh as she gave her 'dadda' raspberries on his neck as he held her, and pointed at the desserts murmuring gleefully 'chocolate'.  A girl after my own heart.  Definitely a family friendly place.  It seemed everyone that worked there had such a good relationship with each other.  They gave samples as freely as their smiles and recommendations.  The hummus was so obviously deliciously fresh, and had the wonderful aroma of garlic.  It's the first time I ever ate hummus by the spoonful.  I could never do that with the store bought stuff.  Yuck.  But this stuff...this was the shiznits!  The lamb panini was oozing caramelized onions and aioli mayo with tender shavings of perfectly cooked lamb on a chewy crusty baguette.  I know, baguette and panini...doesn't seem right...but it was delish.  It came with a side of fresh greens drizzled with balsamic, sprinkled with candied pecans.  Yummers.  The artichoke fritatta was pretty tasty, although I wish it would have been a larger portion for the price.  Fritatta eater wasn't as pleased as I was with my panini.  We tried the creamed green chili soup while there also...that had a mild little bite to it and was yummy as well, but I decided to forgo the soup for tonight.  The piece de resistance had to be the chocolate torte.  Smooth dark Belgian chocolate in a flaky crust.  It just slid right down my throat and gave my tummy a big hug.  Amuse Bouche is actually a take-out / catering restaurant.  Just keep in mind if you take out, it's not a fast food restaurant so you'll be waiting a little for your food.  I didn't mind at all since the people there just chatted with us while the food was being prepared.  The menu changes daily, so you're bound to find something tasty every day.  Synopsis:  A second, third, fourth....maybe more...visit is definitely in my future.  For about a dollar more than McDonald's (remember, the people who didn't know who People Day was even though they made the sign) you can get fresh food that is a whole heck of a lot healthier and tastier.  They even have imported drinks if you're in the mood to try.  Amuse my Bouche anytime!"}
{"text":"Surprise, cute little place in Surprise!  Met a friend who was in town for work in Surprise.  I'm a Central Phx person so this was a long drive out for me.  Worth it to meet my friend and I feel lucky to find this cute spot!  Comfy and clean and good service!  Started with a tasty little Amuse Bouche, which was an avocado bruschetta.  Ok!  Then, because it was 111 out, we ordered cool salads.  I enjoyed the citrus salad with chicken and my friend had a lovely chop with blue cheese.  All served with warm bread.  Nice wine list and, again, very good service.  Glad to find this little gem of a non-chain restaurant in Surprise!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and was very impressed! Don't think of coming without a reservation. The food was amazing and the staff always keep your beverage full!"}
{"text":"Obviously experiencing \"new owner\" pains. Waited 30\" to place our order and over an hour for the meal. Wait staff is obviously new. Did they expand the kitchen when the dining room was expanded? Doesn't appear to be the case. Unfortunately they will chase away a lot of customers who were anxiously awaiting the reboot. We may try again in 6 mos to see if they've figured it out."}
{"text":"We have dined several times at Amuse Bouche for lunch and keep going back for one reason - the food is great.    One of the highlights on the lunch menu is the Cabernet burger.  The couple sitting at the table next to us each had the burger and we overheard their comments as follows: \"this burger changed my life\" said the man.  The woman called a friend and said \"this is the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I didn't even need to add ketchup!\"  I think that about says it all.  I've also had the Cabernet burger, and it is really great.  But that's not all that is on the menu.  You can start with their pâté which is wonderful (although they could give you a few more bits of toasted bread because you run out of them before you run out of pâté).  Their salads are delicious and plentiful.  The sandwiches are great.  I had the Parisian sandwich on my most recent visit (with black forest ham, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, etc., on a baguette) and a wonderful side salad.  I've also had the Panini's, including the Cuban and the lamb.  They are both excellent.  And finally, the French fries.  They are beer battered and served piping hot.  It is worth going there just to have the fries.  As other commenters have noted, this is a very small place, but the service is excellent and the food is terrific.  You should give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for breakfast in honor of our anniversary. We were not disappointed. We started out with beignets, of course, and they were worthy of New Orleans and smothered in powdered sugar. Hubby had the spinach eggs florentine and I had  their corned beef eggs benedict. Both of us agreed they were lovely dishes. The holandaise sauce was light and creamy and my corned beef hash, made from scratch, was the best I have ever eaten. Hubby found out they had bread pudding, so he opted for a desert with our breakfast. I had a bite, loved the sauce, but was to full to share anymore. Our service was top notch. The owners do the cooking and the woman came over several time to see how we were liking everything. All in all, a very pleasant experience and we will certainly be going back, maybe for lunch next time."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant in the West valley. We've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The sandwiches are fabulous, even the half I took home for later. Breakfast is delightful. OMG the  beignets! Tonight we went for a Father's Day 3 course dinner. The prime rib was incredible. More impressive was the attitude of the service staff despite being short handed. They were welcoming and friendly and efficient. This is one of the best restaurants in the valley. It is BYOB so go prepared and hungry."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of enjoying this amazing food not once but twice in as many days. My first time was lunch in there location.  Everything was so delicious. Fritters, goat cheese, meatloaf, the daily special green chili soup was the best! The next day we had them cater an event for our family for about 50 people.  They did a wonderful job with the food and service.  The crab cakes, shrimp, hummus, brie with port/fig chutney, salmon mouse all to die for.  The choclate eclairs and lemon tarts were fantastic. This little place is a great find.  The owners and chiefs have perfected their knowledge of french cooking to everything they make and it's something definitely not to be missed.  Only wish we didn't live in another state. Definitely a place to stop anytime you are near Surprise Az."}
{"text":"My parents come here all the time so when I was there to visit, we had to pay a visit. Great menu although a little misleading - the soup of the day was corn chowder with green chilies however the menu felt more French than Southwestern. Service was great - above and beyond even though they claimed they didn't have our reservation written down. Duck Confit was amazing, very traditional served with lentils, crispy skin and so delicious. I hope that one day they have a stand alone space or larger space.  Using the bathroom is a bit awkward as the door opens right into the dining room."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on Saturday morning only to be informed that they only have breakfast on Sunday mornings from 8 - 11 am. Coffee was weak -- had them take it back. Very limited menu."}
{"text":"My family loved their dinner but unfortunately the restaurant was unwilling to accommodate my request for a vegetarian entree. When our server checked with the kitchen, she reported that everything was already portioned out and they couldn't make me a plate of polenta & roasted vegetables. Weak."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best restaurants in Surprise. We went on Mother's Day and it was crowded and we were glad we had a reservation. Despite the crowd they seemed to be well staffed and service was efficient and friendly. I had the plain waffle which was perfectly cooked. Very flavorful with crispy outside and soft inside the only downfall (which makes this a 4 star review rather than a 5 star) is that they didn't bring any butter and I had to go inside to ask for some and although the waitress arrived promptly the butter was cold and hard which obviously didn't spread well on with my room temperature waffle. My mother had the waffle with vanilla whipped cream and fruit and that was amazing the whipped cream was delicious! My in-laws ordered beignets which were large, light and flaky with lots of powered sugar. There was enough to share and they were great. My husband even liked them and he's not a fan of  beignets. They also got the country potatoes which were oven roasted and very good. Along with that they both had the fresh fruit which was freshly cut bananas, melon and berries and it looked very good.  My husband got the corned beef benedict with their homemade corned beef and he loved it and thought it was one of the best corned beefs he'd had in a long time. They also have great coffee; not bitter the kind you can enjoy drinking black. It was a very good choice for Mother's Day and not overly expensive. We will be back the next time we visit the in-laws in Sun City Grand."}
{"text":"I must be nuts. This place is across the street from us and it took an old buddy to tell me about it yesterday. So we golf carted over there for brunch. Delicious and not expensive. Had eggs Benedict for the first time in years. I'm trying lunch real soon. Considering that the place was packed, it didn't take long. Be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Stopped by here and had a Croque Monsieur sandwich and some green chile soup. Both were excellent. Will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Delightful restaurant with delicious food. I had the Eggs Benedict with brisket. Absolutely wonderful. My husband had a bacon, ham, swiss cheese crepe with scrambled eggs. Scrumptious! This was Sunday brunch and will definitely be going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating off of the brunch menu and it was fantastic. I had the eggs Florentine and they were great. I think I like that even better than the dinner menu, which although very good, could use a little facelift and maybe offer a few more options. If you're in the area, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and never felt the need to Write a review but the new ownership isn't doing this place any favors. The burgers are smaller and over cooker and breakfast on Sundays has went way down hill. Burnt potatoes and smaller portions.  Service is still good but food takes forever."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight for date night dinner because the reviews were so good. Frankly, the reviews do it NO justice!! The food is simply amazing, and we are going back for the much talked about breakfast tomorrow. It's small, but quiet and perfect for a more romantic dinner. BYOB which is fine for us bc we don't drink. Same price you will pay for the steakhouse down the road but Waaaay better food.. Everything is prepared fresh daily from scratch. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum.  What a great surprise to find a wonderful French Bistro on my trip to Arizona last week.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all top notch.  I went there with a foodie friend and he loved it too.  We were fighting for the last beignet.  If you go there on Sunday, like I did, I'd advise making a reservation.  The place was packed!  The beignet was heavenly and my eggs benedict was just a masterpiece.  Bravo Amuse Bouche!  The food, atmosphere, and ambience reminded me of my days living in Paris.  So if the cost of a ticket to France is too much, just take a trip to this great little bistro and save a bundle.  Leave your passport at home, but bring your appetite.  You'll get a taste of France and won't be disappointed.  You'll be transformed to the city of lights and might even walk out speaking French.  Encore, encore!"}
