{"text":"My new favorite place! With working in Foster Plaza, it's great to find a quick/easy/cheap way to get a great lunch! Sojourn never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Sojourn is Awesome!  Staff is super friendly (And usually remember your name), food is excellent, and prices are more than reasonable. They have 3 daily specials that are anywhere from $6-8 and come with a sandwich/wrap/pasta, fruit and soup, you are NOT allowed to alter them in any way, but they are almost always great."}
{"text":"I think I ate here 10 business days in a row after I discovered Sojourn years ago. I'm a fan of soups, fresh ingredients, and anything you can put between slices of grilled bread. Often times you get a side of smiles and a friendly 'thank you' on your way out the door. I'm also a big fan of value and consistency, 3 daily specials ranging from $5.95- $7.95 that are posted daily on their facebook page makes ordering a cinch - most sandwiches come with soup or salad and a fruit cup and a pickle spear. To-go orders are neatly packed with utensils and condiments. Soup comes with crackers.  If you are short on time, you can call ahead and they will have your order ready when you arrive. Outdoor seating is nice on a warm day too. Some of my favorites - pastrami rachel, pan fried buffalo chicken, ahi tuna, cajun turkey wrap, grilled chicken with pepperoni - the list is endless. All of their soups are home runs: mushroom, crab, or lobster bisque, creamy french onion, wisconsin cheddar..   If I ever leave this area for another job, I will be the one at a disadvantage for lack of the perfect lunch option!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for lunch in the area.  Friendly service; they will learn your name.  Its clear they care and provide a delicious meal at a very good price!  Wish there was a bit more seating inside but no fault to them."}
{"text":"Sojourn is an excellent lunch spot with delicious menu options like the steak Caesar wrap and crab cakes in addition to daily specials which include soup and a side for a very reasonable price.  For less than $10, I'm not sure why anyone would opt for fast food options nearby.  You might have to wait 5 minutes longer but you're sure to get fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite on my way to a meeting in Greentree. I was about to (reluctantly) settle for Subway when I spotted this joint across the street.   I arrived just after 1, the place was empty. I ordered one of the specials for $5.95 - which I assumed was the price of the sandwich. No - that was the price of the sandwich, a cup of soup, pickle, and a fruit cup.   Aside from being a great deal, the food was great. I had the crab chowder and a cajun-rubbed turkey sandwich (which was loaded).   This is a great spot for lunch - great food and reasonable prices. Highly recommend - it's a welcome alternative to the chains on Noblestown."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. The workers are also great. I eat here often. I always order one of their specials. There are usually 3 per day. $5.95, $6.95, and $7.95. They are usually sandwiches/burgers/wraps, and pastas. They all come with a side salad, or 1 of 3 soups which is usually the route I go. I love their chicken noodle soup, wedding soup, crab bisque, and Chicken Cavatelli. For sandwiches, I get their Chicken Parm, Buffalo Chicken, Italian Wrap, Marinated Chicken Breast. They also have a pasta that I like which is penne with chicken and shrimp in hot pepper mafalda sauce. You can't go wrong for the money. This place is great. It is very small, so hard to eat in sometimes if you are there during peak hours. Once it gets nice out, they do have a few tables out on the sidewalk. I usually get it to go. If you want to see their daily specials, friend them on facebook where they post the 3 specials and 3 soups every day. Sometimes they cater, and close these restaurant up which stinks, but you can also see that on facebook. Great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Phenominal food. High quality with low prices. Clean place. Owner was manning the fort. Nothing better than a committed business owner. Entire meal was under 10$.   Pulled into this place on accident. Best mistake I made. Found my self a new go to spot.    Highly recommended   Honest and well maintained business. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Sojourn catered the funeral luncheon for my father-in-law today and the food was excellent.  The price was very reasonable and the portion sizes were excellent.  I would recommend Sojourn for any catering needs."}
{"text":"Great food - try the specials as they are cheap and tasty. A welcome deli in Greentree, PA!"}
{"text":"This review is for take out! I work a few miles away so a coworker and I called in our order and picked it up (ready in 10 minutes!). I was only inside for a minute, but it seemed like a good environment... small only about 5 tables but perfect for a quick lunch!  I ordered the two sliders with a cup of soup combo: turkey and havarti, tuna salad with hot pepper cheese, and the cheddar and cauliflower soup ($5.95). To my surprise my meal also came with a pickle and a cup of fruit! The tuna was fresh and the havarti was a delicious touch to the turkey sammy. And the soup... mmm creamy, cheesy goodness!  My coworker got the special of two Italian sliders with a cup of wedding soup. He says this is his favorite wedding soup ever.   Typically when I hear \"slider\" I think small so I was glad I was able to select two. But I didn't even get to my second slider until a few hours later! It was very filling.   Be sure to check out their Facebook page for daily specials!"}
