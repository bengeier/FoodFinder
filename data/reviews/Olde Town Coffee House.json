{"text":"Best pie in Dane County! Great service and good food. Veggie Benedict is my favorite item on the menu."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here twice and both were delicious.  Reuben was very good.  Fish sandwich was humongous!  I am not a fan of waffle fries but there are several sides to choose from.  Their home made soups are very good but I was not fond of the chili.  It was too spicy for my taste.  A friend ordered the Mediterranean omelet and said it was very good.  It was loaded with veggies including artichoke hearts..several large.  The service is very friendly and the portions are \"Wisconsin sized\". Ya, hey.  So for me there is always enough for another meal.  I have not had any of their homemade desserts but I was nearly tempted to order pecan pie yesterday.  It looked SO good.  If you have time to shop there is a wonderful gift shop next door called SPLURGE.  They have many items I have not seen anywhere else.  Right now is everything Christmas.  Gorgeous ornaments, floral arrangements and gifts."}
{"text":"We occasionally stop on Sunday morning  for breakfast. Food was \"good\", but service seems to be a problem. Had to ask several times for silver ware, asked for water but never got it.  For the prices, a little better service would be good."}
{"text":"Wonderful food - I've never had a bad thing here. Their cinnamon rolls are the best I've ever had (although sadly they sell out fairly early on Saturday mornings - which is not good for late risers like me).   Service is always good. It has a cozy, small town service kind of feel that I enjoy although when they're busy it can get pretty loud.   Only negative thing: I wish they were open all day - there are times my husband and I want their food AFTER 2:00 PM."}
{"text":"I'm not your average person that just accepts food that is edible. Olde Town Coffee House did not have very good breakfast. The biscuits and gravy were lukewarm, probably frozen. There was a *very small* selection of coffee, which I didn't expect considering the name of the place. I probably won't give breakfast another chance here."}
{"text":"Great food. Well done and everything came out hot. Service was excellent. Got the bacon and avocado skillet and it made 2 meals and was delicious. Would go again!"}
{"text":"This review is I for coffee only since that's all I had. Let's just say it was the worst latte I've ever had. For a place that calls self \"coffee and tea\" in their name, you should be able to get it right. It tasted thin, almost watered down.  Just none of the richer, nuttiness you get from a good latte. Maybe they aren't using high-quality beans.  Anyway I'll probably be back to try breakfast but not coffee. Un uh."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast. Only go a couple of times a year, but it's been good every time. Best place for breakfast in town."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we're traveling through. We love love love this place!!   Today, my wife and daughter had the chicken pot pie, and I had a ham frittata. Both were delicious. We added Cinnascone and a gf blueberry muffin. Yum  And the coffee is always delicious! Great place for a highway stop, as well as a great place to hangout for awhile!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie eggs benedict and a side of grilled asparagus (don't judge me).  Hubby had biscuits & gravy, we both had coffee and OJ.  B & G-had scrambled eggs on top, yummy biscuits, gravy was rich with a good amount of locally made sausage, nice flavor.  Generous portion.  My EB needed more hollandaise sauce, and the flavor wasn't as robust as I prefer.  Nice crispy red potatoes, not soggy.  A few coffee choices, nothing special.  They had run out of Kona blend but brought some out immediately.  Decent service."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot! We went in around 11 a.m. on a Saturday and the place was really dead...which is always kind of nice when we're eating out with the kid.  I ended up getting their chorizo Benedict, and it was pretty good!  It wasn't AMAZING, but I would eat it again. My husband did like his corned beef hash, but it was a little weird looking...like they didn't finish cooking the potatoes.  It was almost impossible for him to eat with a fork because everything was slippery on his plate - if they had browned the potatoes more it would have been perfect.  I really enjoyed my cup of coffee and the lady working was nice.  We would definitely stop in again when we're in town!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Cottage Grove to grad a bite to eat. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. You'll have to order at the counter, but the waitstaff brings your food out to your table. They also have a great patio in the summer."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have coffee, great sandwich or salad! The menu is huge, food is fresh and made to order. It's always clean and the service is great..the owner is always super friendly with a smile on her face!"}
{"text":"A-OK is pretty much on target for my thoughts on this place.  It was a cute restaurant and seemed to have a healthy business which is nice to see after the closing of Heritage Cafe in Madison on Cottage Grove Road.  I had the fiesta wrap with fruit.  Other side options were waffle fries and cottage cheese and I appreciated the selection.  The wrap was fine but far from a party in my mouth.  I was hoping it would be a bit more spicy, but understand they probably have to cater to milder tastes.  Next time I'll try something else.  I imagine Old Town Coffee House probably shines at breakfast.  Next time I should consider doing that although I feel I can probably make a healthier choice with lunch.  Finally, service seemed a little slow but that could simply be because they were pumping out the entrees and since I was by myself today, I didn't have conversation to pass the time."}
{"text":"This is a good place to drop in for a to-go coffee. I had some time to kill and was needing a caffeine fix. Olde Town is set up primarily as a diner with booths and tables with just a small area of couches for lounging. The price for standard brewed coffee was very affordable with their large (approx ~24oz) clocking in at $1.95.  I'd like to try this spot again for a meal, as it seems like a popular spot for local residents!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and really enjoyed the food I've had and the waitstaff is all really friendly.  You also get very big portions for a great price."}
{"text":"En route out of town we stopped at  Olde Town for breakfast. It is a quick serve casual type place... order at the counter and your food is brought to the table when ready. We were a little put off by the lady at the bakery counter. She didn't seem to know if the items were made on site or not. Eventually she said that they are baked \"downstairs\". The lady taking our order was nice and food was brought out promptly. The food was just ok, nothing fantastic or exceptional to warrant more stars. It was fine, and they allowed us coffees to go, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"The food is very great. Services is awesome. Everything else was great I love the tables set up the way they set up the coffee. The only team that I miss was fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some air conditioning and a quick lunch before my daughter's game at a nearby field.  Ice tea was fresh brewed and strong- fabulous. The rustic ham sandwich was very tasty with high quality ham and cheddar cheese but the fresh fruit was off.  After a bit I realized it smelled like fish.  It happens, a cooler spill or bad cutting board.  Told the waitress and she was very good about it.  I didn't really want anything in return, just asked for more iced tea.  She came back to my table and insisted I have a piece of pie.  It was amazing!  Really good pie is hard to find and that and the customer service really made this a pleasant stop."}
{"text":"Met a colleague here for a business meeting breakfast. It was my first visit because it's not exactly close to home.  The cafe is spacious and clean with lots of natural light and comfortable seating. They had free wi-fi and most excellent self serve coffee.   The menu is diverse enough that you'll find something pleasing to your palette. My eggs were cooked perfectly. The baked goods looked beautiful but I didn't try any of the six types of pie they were offering.   Even though I live a distance away, I'd consider bringing my family for a fun adventure and delish meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town for work, I make a point to eat here. The coffee is always hot and fresh, the meats and cheese they use for their salads and sandwiches is so delicious and the bakery items are no joke! I haven't had their breakfast yet, but I hope to someday! The wifi is good, so you can get work done over your meal if you need to. It can get pretty busy during lunch, so be courteous and don't take a large table I you're a party of one! And get a cinnamon roll. They are divine and as big as my hand!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here on a semi-regular basis but haven't been in several years.  We stopped in today for breakfast and were less than impressed.  The atmosphere is still really nice- bright and clean- but the food was less than stellar. We both had omelets, which sounded good (bacon, cheese, and apples), but ended up being very bland, like there was no seasoning whatsoever.  Couldn't even taste the bacon. The potatoes were decent, but a little greasier than I would have liked (like there was too much oil).  The girl taking our order at the counter was very obviously new and just learning, so I was willing to give her a break on her ineptitude with putting in our orders, but then she brought out our meals and we never got our toast (thought maybe she was bringing out the plates and coming back with the toast, but...not so much). I thought the prices were really high ($9 for each meal), given the quality of the food and the fact that we didn't even get the toast we'd paid for. We didn't have coffee or baked goods this time, so I can't attest to those, but I remember them as being decent in the past.  So not a bad place to stop in, given that there aren't a lot of options in Cottage Grove, but probably not somewhere I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Have never been so disrespected in my life. When I got here I waited about ten minutes in line to place my order. I ordered the chefs favorite omlette (was good when hot). I then proceed outside to the patio with my large glass of water and small orange juice (I prefer water but don't like to be cheap) let me remind you, this is my first time ever here. I stopped between jobs to fuel up with some energy and boy was it a mistake. Upon sitting down I spilled my water, thought oh its no big deal I'll wait to get one when someone comes out. I proceeded to have a conversation with some collegues and my food came out about 30 minutes later. I asked the waitress for a glass of water since I had spilled mine 30 minutes prior and she said \"no, you can get up and get it yourself\" I was so shocked by this answer I didn't even a response as I just watched her walk away. When she came out next, I told her I would really appreciate that water. She said \"I'm really fucking busy right now\" (10am on a weekday morning) and ignored and walked away from me again. I asked to speak with the general manager and she went back inside. She came about five minutes later with a pen and paper and said her manager wasn't here. As she set down the pen and paper for my she tipped over my remaining water on my short! When I stood up to go inside and get my own glass of water she harassed me all the way to the door, at one point saying \"hey little boy, don't you go in there and cause a scene\" mind you, I'm a 27 year old who owns multiple buisnesses. I have NEVER been spoke to this way. By the time I got back to my food, my business partners were gone. We were all completely embarraseed and humiliated in public by this waitress and I will never come back here nor would I ever recommend anyone else does either. My hunch is this place will evaporate with more stories of horrible customer service. Would rate 0 stars if possible. I came hungry, I left hungry, mad, and soaking wet"}
{"text":"This is a very busy place. A little disorganized. The staff were kind of rude. they don't really smile or are very approachable. Food was okay. Probably won't come back but I'm happy that Cottage Grove has a brunch place."}
{"text":"The French toast is my favorite.  Like to get sausage patties and a good cup of tea. They put vanilla in their hot chocolate, I prefer no vanilla. They are aways accommodating.  Nice people great food, clean,fresh and a very pleasant place in general."}
