{"text":"Had to grab a quick lunch and some of the locals who work down the street suggested Niko's for a delectable snack.  I'm a sucker for gyros and tzatziki sauce so I had to order it when I saw it on the menu.  The food came out fast and was pipping hot...and delicious!  The fries could be better, though.  Oh, and if you order a large sweet tea, you be prepared to get a LARGE sweet tea.  They're not kidding.  Puts Cook-Out's \"big-ass\" sweet tea to shame."}
{"text":"Excellent food and plenty of seating.  The gyro was great - they definitely nailed the tazitki sauce!"}
{"text":"Not too bad.  Lots on the menu for a deli.  Atmosphere is fair and it's a bit loud in the dining room especially with a woman yelling out numbers for order pickups (extremely irritating).  Sandwiches are ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"99 Health Grade - yay!!! 
This is a great spot for lunch!!  Don't be deterred by a long line - it moves quickly.  Their hours are 7AM-3PM: Monday - Friday.  I have never eaten anything bad here!  Fresh food, friendly staff, great food - and quick service: what's not to love?"}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would. I went here today to pick up some breakfast for my co workers and I. I called in our order and asked if I could substitute my grits for fruit, the young lady on the phone said thats fine at no charge. As Im paying for my food I see an additional charge added on as the cashier was ringing me up, I asked her what the charge was for, she stated it was an additional charge for the fruit. I informed her the young lady on the phone stated there was no extra charge. She replied and stated she wasnt the cashier and there is a charge as she proceeded to snatch my card out of my hand and say she'll just take it off. I asked one of the cooks who the owner of the restaurant was and she said it was the cashier. The same cashier that snatched my card out of my hand. The cook asked what was wrong, I explained to her that she was rude and she's usually rude when we come in. The cook replied and stated \"maybe it was something you did to her, she's nice to everyone else and if you dont like the service you dont have to come back\" I've never heard this come from any business, I was truly appauled.  I then return and say due to the poor service I would like a refund. The Owner/cashier asked what was wrong, I explained to her the issue. She denied her being rude, she stated \"if theres nothing wrong with your food I can't give you your money back, its your problem\" (while putting my food back into the bag). During this time her daughter/cook is at the front saying she called the police. My co worker and I were standing there speaking to the owner calmly and professionally  doing nothing wrong only asking for a refund due to the poor and rude service we received (this is not the first time, I decided to try again assuming she wasnt having a good day). The food itself is mediocre and overpriced and definitely not worth being treated in such a manner where u feel uncomfortable especially when you're the one spending the money at their establishment.  Its just unfortunate that there are still people who have such a backwards way of thinking towards others and feel they can speak to people any kind of way just because they own the establishment.  I would not ever visit this place again nor would I recommend them to anyone. She did not try to rectify the situation or apologize she clearly stated to my co worker and I,  if you dont like our service you dont have to come back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had chicken pita with a side of fries. Very average, pita was a bit dry. Chicken was pretty good though. Fries were fried in old grease. Didn't really had another option for lunch in the area though except for crappy fast food places."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for sure among all of us in that work in the area. The ladies that work here are kind, quick, and make darn good food. They always have awesome specials but they will even customize your order based on your diet needs. Couldn't ask for a better Breakfast/lunch spot! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch.. Greek American. We were over at the airport center for training and there are not a lot of choices for lunch so we decided to check out this place that was within walking distance. Menu includes hot sandwiches, wraps, gyros, and salads. Pretty basic. But if you are short on time you get your food pretty quick."}
{"text":"My last review was deleted but that just proves my point. I guess there was too much honesty in it. I witnessed a paying customer being treated so rudely and then threatened with calling the police when she spoke up for herself. And the only difference I could pinpoint between her and other customers was the color of her skin. Spend your money in other places that value it."}
{"text":"No frills, cafeteria style diner, which totally works as they feed hundreds of near by workers. 

Only disappointment was having breakfast end at 10am - Everyone knows breakfast is the best meal at places like this."}
{"text":"Good....fast....friendly.  There's just a little bit of everything for everyone at Niko's Grill.  Kinda half deli, half counter-service.  This is a great place to drop by for when you're in a big hurry, or not."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic ! I eat here regularly and have never had a bad meal. My go to is the grilled chicken pita, but I can vouch for almost everything on the menu. The family that owns Nikos is really great and make me feel right at home. You can tell this is their passion, lots of love in the food! 
I've also had them cater a few work events for me too- amazing! They do a really great job customizing the menu to the picky coworkers :) and think of everything, it's such a breeze when they handle it.
Don't be scared of the long lines-they move fast!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Horrible coffee. The best thing on the menu is the Tuna melt on Rye."}

{"text":"I was in Charlotte on a business trip, and decided to give Niko's a try since it was so close. I ordered the Grilled chicken Greek salad, and it was delicious! Well done Niko's well done!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite for the guys at work.  The Chicken Parmesan Sandwich is truly a delightful meal, and I have yet to have any sandwich that was not anything but delicious.  

Open for breakfast and lunch, it has plenty of seating for the local college students and business park employees.  It seems to have the entire Charlotte Police Dept eating there daily which is very interesting seeing that they do not sell doughnuts at all.

This is not a fast food joint, but you do place the order at the counter, and they will yell your number when ready.  The line is usually to the door, but it does move fast and they do have a separate takeout/pickup line for those who choose to call ahead.

It's off the beaten path, but if you have time during the week for lunch and you are near the airport, do yourself a favor and give this place a try.

Plenty of parking is available, and the service is good.  

If I had another hand, I would give it 3 thumbs up.

{"text":"If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  

Got the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  

Summary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again."}
{"text":"I just started a job over here and was happy to find a little place that's right by where I'll be working.  It was a decent sized place and when we first walked in I was worried because the line was pretty long. Well, I have to say, the line is definitely from the yumminess & price of the food because they moved us through super fast. They had alot to choose from, and I tried the chicken parmesan. The cheese was just dripping off and man it was good!! I'll definitely be back to this little place."}
{"text":"Great food for a quick stop to eat fast food with home cooked quality.  Customer service was happy to have a convo about how good the okra is."}
