{"text":"This Thai place used to be my favorite thai in the valley until it changed ownership. After the it went down the drain. I used to give it 5 stars. The old owner opened up Bola Thai in Mesa which is my new fav!"}
{"text":"So I would rate this place better but I just can't get past the service... I can only hope you don't get the server I seem to get every time I go in... Even Togo she is so crazy... She can't speak english or understand and then it just gets more crazy as the night go's bye...... The Pumpkin Curry is wonderfull... The Museman Curry is good as well... don't get the yellow curry no goods!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite thai restaurant.This place has amazing food.Go here for my birthday every year.Some personal favorites are: thai tea with cream and sugar,mee krob appetizer,the spicy soups,prik king,red coconut curry with scallops,garlic shrimp,curry noodles,pad thai and for dessert the coconut icecream with custard or the sticky rice with mango all very yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place and the food is amazing in my opinion. I do have to agree that the service can be slower and at times rude.  I have been going here long enough to know that the waitress is nice and I haven't experienced any issues myself but I have witnessed situations that would lead to some of the previous reviews. Overall, I say give it a chance if you want some good Thai food. I eat her frequently and have yet to find a dish that I do not like."}
{"text":"I LOVE thai food but I have tried this place at least 3 different times and it has falken short EVERY time. Food is mediocre and the only positive side is that they have cheap lunch specials, I believe $6.95 - that includes entree, veggie soup and veggie eggroll. However I dont mind paying money for some tasty food but I guess if you are on a budget and like mediocre thai food or dont know any better this is the place for you ! The lady who is a waitress is hell-a rude and ignores her customers. Walks away while you are talking to her, waves her hand says ok and doesn't bring out what you had tried to ask for. The previous visit she completey screwed up our order and begged for us to still eat it and pay for it because she would get in trouble with boss....we wouldn't have minded if it was something we ate but it was shrimp and we both are vegetarians, we even told her before we order (no fish sauce, we are vegetarians and dont eat meat or seafood ) ummmm NO THANK YOU !! The most recent  visit we did get lunch specials and I didn't realize it came with an eggroll and soup until we saw the waitress bring it out for another table who just got there , I asked her but this time we already were eating our entress. She brought it out anyways and I figured better late than never, right ? When we were getting up I heard that same waitress arguing with another customer since she tried to convince him that is what he ordered aftet she brought the wrong item to him....I actually cant believe she is still there !!!"}
{"text":"The food is really amazing-but there is a catch. The servicr is really slow. Once I waited 45 min in the restaurant for a to go order. Another time it took almost an hour, and probably bc the order was lost. When we wanted some to go boxes, I had to stand there waiting for them to ask me fir, I kid you not 5 min. I ended up just finding them myself. Also do tour own math on the bill."}
{"text":"Once I discovered Mint Thai I quit Chinese food - that was 20 years ago.   While the lunch special is a great deal, your best bet is to come in a large group and share a big mess family style with some dishes spicy and some not.   Curries! The Gang Ped (Red Curry) is bold and straightforward while the Pineapple Curry (also red) is a good combination of spicy and sweet (I recommend at least 2 stars, 3+ if you can handle the heat - which is a good flavorful hot, not just brute force).   Entrees: The Pad Thai is has a nice peanut flavor and is neither sticky nor chewy as at some other places. The Rama Beef is a good change up with tender beef in a peanut sauce over thin crispy noodles. Spicy Cashew is another family favorite.  Lastly, the service is great and the people are extremely friendly.  How good is Mint Thai? When no one in the family is available and my grandma needs a fix, she brings her cleaning lady - checkmate."}
{"text":"I've tried lots of Thai restaurants in the East Valley and a couple in Phoenix. I have to say that Mint Thai is the best!! Like someone said earlier, it is in a location that isn't admirable but when you walk inside it's very welcoming.   I took my friend here and he has never had Thai before and after that he said he was a fan. The service is always good. We didn't wait very long till we received our orders.  I'm very lucky for this place to be located in the East Valley.  I ordered the Rama Beef which I always get every time I come here. It has a peanut buttery flavor which engulfed my pallet, I smooth and the seasonings are just perfect. My friend had the Sizzling Beef, I've never had it before but it was really good. They bring out a HOT skillet and place the vegetable and beef on it and watch it sizzles!! It was way cool! Be careful though it's still hot, wait a few minutes.   The music they play is Thai which gives it that ambiance of Asia... I guess. I do want their CDs though even though I don't know what their saying!!  ALSO most Thai restaurants close between 2-4pm this little one is open from 11AM-9PM no breaks in between. I've had this problem before where I'm craving Thai between 2-4pm and no one seems to be open, it's a pain!!"}
{"text":"I decided awhile back I was going to try all the restaurants in my neighborhood - don't worry I'm still going to work out! ;) Mint Thai is a little cafe located in a strip mall - it's not fancy by any means but the food is incredible!! I'm a firm believer that not everything is as it seems. The exterior of this cafe is rather modest and not for snotty at heart looking for \"the scene\". The only scene you'll find here is aromatic dishes served in a quaint cafe by the friendly owners.   I've been to Thailand a few times now and although the food is not quite as good as my dinner on the beach, with the sun setting over the ocean, in the Phi Phi island's...this is Gilbert! With that said it's very good and lived up to my expectations of what I know Thai food in America to be."}
{"text":"Love this place and been coming for years.  Panang Curry and Rama Beef are our favorites.  They are very good at getting the spice level just the way you want it.  The entree servings always are ample for an extra meal to take home.  I have always had the same server (she may be the only one) and I find her very kind.  I think sometimes there is a language barrier but never found her to be rude."}
{"text":"The food is stellar!  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend the mussaman curry and coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"this place was so so.  we went on easter they were not busy at all but the service was awful.  they were slow and the food wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry which was very tasty, the ambience was a little dark and stuffy. The food was OK not fantastic, just ok. The price and the food went hand in hand. You def get what you pay for...and everything is pretty resonably priced."}
{"text":"Did lunch on a Tuesday, and ordered a lunch special.  Food was mediocre, and service was quite slow - it looked like they were well under-staffed, even for a slow(ish) weekday.  Close to where I was (thanks Yelp), so may go again, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Hands down still the best Thai food in the Valley. A staple in the east valley since the early 1980's. The Mint Thai Cafe Menu is extensive, with all the traditional Thai fare. Several specials are offered. Tonight Pumpkin Curry. Over thirty years in business and still the best place for great Thai food.."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible! The pepper steak was served in a gelatinous soup like substance. The brown rice was mush and had mysterious red color. Meat was old n withered. As for the service. The woman always there, maybe the owner is certainly bat shit crazy... As for the rest they are all pretty zany characters. Ewww! Worst Thai place in Gilbert. I will never walk in that place again."}
{"text":"Very tasty meal. Served nice and warm just the way I like it. As far a spiciness goes a 1 star is probably adequate. We had the 40( Gang Kew Wan - Flavorful green curry paste cooked with coconut milk, green peas, and bamboo shoots and sweet basil $9.95) and 44 (Mixed Vegetable Curry  Mixed vegetables with coconut milk and red curry $10.95) both with chicken. I loved my 40. Also had Tom Ka Gai (chicken) - Thai hot-and-sour soup with chicken, herbs, and lime juice in light creamy coconut milk broth $10.95 (Delicious)"}
{"text":"Good food! Staff is normally friendly, sometimes a little slow but always a smile. They aren't huge fans of keeping the inside temperature down, so if your looking for a cool down on a summer day... Wait till late in the evening!"}
{"text":"I like this thai restaurant a lot for their pad thai.  Very flavorful.  Consistently good service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We have been going here for years. My favorite thing to order is the curry noodles. I haven't seen this at any other thai places in the area.  The eggplant dish comes is a close second! The staff is also very kind and welcoming.  The food taste is consistant whether you are eating in or getting take out."}
{"text":"Some great Thai food at  a very reasonable price. The chicken satay is amazing and the Kang Karee is really good too . And they have some of the best soups I have ever tried. This is definately a place to try for some high quality authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"we said hello and sat ourselves after a brief but interesting/awkward game of who-can-stare-at-each-other-longer with the waitress upon walking in, and looked over the extensive menu. lots of options and the lunch prices were good.  the waitress comes and asks if we are ready to order? no not yet. okay drinks? oh yes, let's flip back over to that page. but she backed away at that point and said in broken english that she'd be back later. we had a bit of a laugh about that. but she did finally come back and took our order when we were ready.  the thai iced coffee was 10/10. the spicy cashew entree i had for lunch was 10/10. the potstickers are 11/10!!! -- seriously a *must have* --- so the food is quite good. the service is about as expected for a hole in the wall thai restaraunt, but after we had ordered we were checked on regularly by multiple friendly staff. holes in the walls are always a hit or a miss and this one's a hit. thank you for a tasty lunch, we will come back again."}
{"text":"So, the food here was pretty decent with one small problem-- our food was so unbelievably spicy that neither of us could stomach it! I am not usually one to shy away from spicy food, but... let me put it this way: thai food leftovers never make it more than 24 hours in my house, and I threw out two almost full boxes after several days. Being from Washington, I am pretty critical of my thai food; and this was just not the best around."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on the advice of a neighbor & I was pleasantly surprised. It was really good food. Haven't been back since, but that is only because of the price. A little high for my budget, but was a nice experience.  The place seems like a dump when you walk in, but the food is actually quite good. I'd go back if I had an extra $40-$50 for 2 people to eat dinner."}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"Spicy mint thai chicken 5 stars please\" Thats what I'm talking about sucka. Not for the faint of heart this is spicy, very spicy. We get it togo at our work so I can't speak as to the service or atmosphere, but the food is damn good."}
{"text":"Finally....I found good Thai food in the valley.  In the mood for Thai and not ready to go to the same bland places I've been to, I reached out to Yelp yesterday and found Mint Thai.  Although the construction on the 101 made getting there tough, it was well worth the drive!  When the 4 of us arrived, we were a little nervous. 7:15pm on a Saturday night there were only 2 cars in the parking lot. Once we got inside, we started to feel a little better as the Thai host greeted us. The decor was pretty common Thai...seemed dated but comfortable.   To start, we ordered some Tom Yum and  Tom Ka, both traditional and tasty, although we agreed that the Tom Ka was a bit richer in flavor.  For dinner, we ordered 4 dishes and all got thumbs up!  Gang Kew Wan....or Green Curry with Chicken...DEEEElicious. The peas, the basil, and the curry had great flavor.  We had ordered it medium and I think I would have preferred it Hot...but was able to spice it up with a little chili powder provided on the table.   Eggplant Pad Prik- eggplant, spicy garlic sauce and basil. Awesome flavors and balance  Lard Na w/ Beef- The noodles had great consistency, the beef and broccoli great flavor. The gravy was good but a little thinner than I've had in the past making it seem a little watery. The dish needed a little more heat but was still really good.  Pad Thai- Should be staple at any Thai place and Mint Thai's did not disappoint. Lots of layers and flavors. Sweet but not too sweet. Good size portion, lots of sprouts and onions and ample chopped peanuts on the side to mix in. Really good.  If looking for good Thai food without the need for a great deal of ambience and don't mind the strip mall idea, you should definitely check our Mint Thai!"}
{"text":"I loved it. The place was quiet, so we got good service, the lady was super friendly. We had all kinds of curry, and they were excellent. Don't know about the rest of the menu, but the curries were great. We also had desert some kind of ice cream and that was also good.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mint Thai Cafe is a very brave litttle restaurant that is successful in it's desire to forsake the \"strip mall\" prejudices.  When pulling up in front of the Cafe, for the first time, it appears very normal and expectations tend to be lessened.  Upon entering, however, you are treated to an intimate atmosphere where the actual dining room is not immediately visible.  the hostess greets you with a warm smile and brings you around the corner.  There, you are seated at one of the 8 or nine tables in the room.  There appears to be a secondary room as well, but I have never been sat there.   The server is there, also with a genuine smile and offers welcome and beverages.  The menu is full of the same wonderful items you would expect to see in a Thai restaurant, however there seems to be something extra.... My dining companion and I order a couple of apetizers to share a nd a couple of entrees to try.  we both like it very spicey, soa s we sweat through our meal we are unceaseingly complimenting every bite!  Perhaps it is because our eyes are watering and we are engrossed in the experience, but we do not notice that our water and iced tea glasses are constyantly being refilled without our noticing it.   That is what I loved besides the great tasting food.  The service is all over it without being all over you.  I really hate intrusive service that many yelpers also seem to mention in their reviews. Mint Thai Cafe is professional, authentic and oh so convenient!"}
{"text":"The food at Mint Thai Cafe is AWESOME!! My family and I have been coming to Mint Thai for about 14 years now.  This is the best Thai food in the valley!! The yellow curry has a wonderful mix of flavors! The sizzling beef will make you moan with pleasure! We have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed!  The waitresses are very friendly and know us by name.  The yum Yai salad is crisp fresh and delicious! The golden nest appetizers are golden crispy potato \"nest\" filled with chicken, peas and green onions and comes with a sweet spicy sauce!  Wish there were more than 4 to an order!  Just try this restaurant, your taste buds will rejoice!! Can't say enough about the high quality food here!! Corrine Jones"}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices, nice Thai iced coffees and teas, and good service.  We have eaten here three times. Every time was good. This time, my boyfriend had the Po Tak Tom Yum Seafood soup. It was appropriately spicy, flavorful, and the seafood was not overcooked. I had the Spicy Cashew with Shrimp, which was savory and good.  We will return."}
{"text":"There are 3 Thai restaurants that I absolutely adore, and this is one of them. The food is phenomenal, and it's always interesting going to eat there. I say interesting because the waitress is well, interesting. I would recommend this place to anyone when interested in going to eat Thai food in the East Valley. Their prices are average for a Thai restaurant. You can never go wrong with yellow curry or some pad thai, as they both are wonderful comfort foods. I hear their rama beef is phenomenal, I wish I weren't vegetarian just so I'd be able to try. Gr8 place though."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and I swear the waitress never ages... she sometimes comes across as grumpy, but she means well. The food is FANTASTIC, in nearly 17 years i've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Very good Thai. Had the spicy chicken cashew, and it was really, really good. Great flavor...just thought the portion was a little bit too small, as I was definitely wanting more!  Also had the \"Siamese Twins\" of Chicken & Seafood, along with bamboo shoots & green beans in green curry, and would definitely recommend this dish.   Server/staff was humorous and amusing throughout the meal, and added to the peculiar ambiance of this restaurant  Great restaurant"}
{"text":"I have been here on 2 occasions and left happy both times!   Last time I went here with my boyfriend and he had the pepper steak with rice we also ordered the vegetable tempura which was crispy golden and tasted fabulous! The wait staff is always super nice and attentive. I ordered the pad thia noodles with chicken with a number 3 of heat. It was spicy but amazing! This is a good find! I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and both times have had great quality food and excellent service! We have tried the Yellow Curry, Rama Beef, Larb Salad, Tom Kai soup, and for dessert we have had the Sticky Rice with custard and Stick Rice with coconut ice cream! All has be amazing!   Here's a quick tip: This restaurant is perfect for a lazy afternoon meal. Don't come in and expect fast food. They cook the food in traditional methods which takes time. While there we were incredibly embarrassed by people who came in with a snippity attitude and treated the staff here poorly. Be patience and remember, you are here to experience the food and the culture. If not, than order take out!"}
{"text":"There are many different Thai restaurants around the Phoenix Valley that serve red curry, but I have found none that can match the authenticity of Mint Thai. Mint Thai brings the culture, tastes, and ingredients of Thailand right to our community.  The most important part of a Thai meal, especially red curry is that it is authentic. There are four main reasons why Mint Thai has the most authentic red curry.  It can almost be considered as common sense, but it is crucial to the red curry that the ingredients are fresh and imported from Thailand. When you are cooking other types of food, this may not seem as important but with red curry there are a lot of herbs and other ingredients that simply cannot be produced correctly here in America. If they do make it here, it will not be the right flavor to give you the true Thai taste. The red curry paste is specific to Thailand. The spices used in the Thai red curry paste are not the same as other places. Another ingredient, the fish oil is made in Thailand. The fish used has to be caught in the country of Thailand to get the distinct fish that is used there. Different countries make fish oil with their own type of fish causing the taste to vary. The fish go through a fragmenting process and the juices are pressed out of it after a few weeks. All the ingredients used by Mint Thai are from the native country of Thailand and are added to the dish in the proper order to make the perfect dish.   Another thing that Mint Thai does precisely is the way that they use the ingredients that they buy in their red curry.  The order that is used when adding ingredients is critical. For example, contrary to making vegetable stew, where you can add all your ingredients at the same time and throw it in the crock pot or on the stove, and come back to it at a later time, Thai Red Curry must be constantly watched over and made in a particular order. Straying from this order will cause the red curry to not be authentic and taste differently.   So far, I've spoken of things that are important in order to get the taste of the red curry that you are looking for. Now I want to tough on how Mint Thai adds its own personal touch in order to make your experience while dinning and eating red curry feel authentic. The red curry is presented in such a way as you would find in Thailand. The food is always the right temperature and served with white rice. The staffs at Mint Thai are mostly all from the native country of Thailand. Hearing them speak to each other in the Thai language completes the experience. The decorations inside the restaurant are also very traditional Thai. It is complete with a picture of the King and Queen of Thailand, who are very highly respected and loved in Thailand.    Mint Thai gives dinning out for red curry the complete authentic experience. They are friendly and welcoming and the food is also fresh and delicious! The price is very reasonable and eating red curry there is one purchased meal you will not regret."}
{"text":"Sad to say I used to like this place, but had to downgrade my review. Repeated inconsistent service and food quality have made this place hit or miss. I honestly thought they must have sold the place or gone under new management, but I spoke to the owner who told me she has owned it for the last ten years. Startlingly, she told me herself a lot of the issues come from cutting corners to save money. Twice we ordered red curry to go which is extremely liquidy/almost soup like. The literally packed it in a tin foil homemade \"boat\" in a typical square styrofoam to-go box so of course I didn't make it back to work with it it spilling out everywhere all over the bag. When I called and spoke to her and asked get about the packaging she first said that is how they always do it. I explained to her we have ordered many times before and it has always come in a styrofoam cup with a lid and she said that they only do that for the entree not the lunch special because the cups are more expensive. I kindly tried to explain there is no way you can expect a liquid to not spill out of a box that is not sealed. Needless to say customer service was not a major concern for her. Let me add hat they also have recently raised there prices again and reduced their portion s izes. The amount of rice is only about enough for one person and they charge extra if you ask for more rice. On a good day the food has lots of flavor and is well prepared which is why I still gave it any stars at all."}
{"text":"Thai places in the East Valley are all pretty similar. Most offer a 6.95 lunch with an appetizer and one of the standard red/green/panang curries with some other dishes you would only try if you'd already gotten your Panang on this week (or phad thai for the wusses). This place is no different in that respect, but I have found the food consistently pretty good and the service fast. Dinner size portions are giant and will feed two people for 2 days. They can be skimpy with the rice here though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places, i love the tofu Tom Kha made Thai HOT!   Really good Thai coffee too."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai, I love the mussaman chicken curry."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. They don't make my Thai hot quite as hot as it is at Swadee but it's still very good. The service is hit or miss, though. Sometimes it's spot on, sometimes it's not. Last time we were here we waited a long time to be served and our one friend's order was wrong. The food, though, is very good. I enjoy their panang curry and their nam sod. The nam sod is very good with a lot of ginger. I actually like the flavor of it better here than at Swadee but the heat is better at Swadee.   They have a lot of vegetarian options which is nice and the portions are ample and good prices. I can always get a few meals out of one of their dishes so that's a good thing. So, service isn't stellar, food is good, prices and portions are good so it's a regular for us."}
{"text":"Very good place for lunch, prices are reasonable.  Lunch is offered Mon - Sat.  We always enjoyed the food we get here.  We normally order the fried rice lunch special, a noodle dish and another entree.  Friendly staff, can be slow sometimes when the restaurant get crowded."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, Thai food can be HOT --- Super HOT. So when you order, make sure you let them know what level of hot by how many \"stars\" you would like your food. Mint Thai Cafe is good authentic Thai food, so I order \"0\" hot. Yes, I said \"0\".   Don't know what to order - order the Chicken Rama!!! Best dish in the place!!!"}
{"text":"So we've gone back several times since our original review. Things seem to have gone downhill. Last time, one of the plates that came out looked, smelled, and tasted like wet hay. Ew!   4 stars seems to be in the range of 1/2 star--no heat!  Potatoes tasted funky in the yellow curry too.  Not too sure what's going on here, but we're on the prowl for a new Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Thai food.  We are picky about Thai but this moved to the top of our list. We found it on the way to Trader Joe's, which is nearby.  My wife and I had the red and green curry and both were fantastic.  Mine was with chicken and she had the green curry with veggies.  Wonton soup and \"chubby dumplings\" which are like pot stickers.  The portions were large.  I am a big guy with an even bigger appetite and we took food home.  Everything was great, the service was perfect and we will surely be going back soon.  If you like Thai, you need to give this place a try to see if you like it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Massaman Curry ... one word .... YUMMY!  Food was Exceptional (again).  Wife got the Mixed veggie curry and loved it as well.  This looks like the best Thai food in Chandler/Gilbert Area!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food because I am not gonna pay for a place where the server is annoyed by us. It was our first time there so we do not have our number for the food we want memorized. So sorry. Was excited to eat there too Lady was rude."}
{"text":"Well, it is not that it is bad, it just is not good.    The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, it is comfortable and is clean.  The staff were friendly although we were unsure if we were to seat ourselves or wait to be seated (and no one there seemed to want to give us any hints on which to do, as we lingered in the entryway).    The food was presented very well, it looked great!! However after diving into it I found that the presentation was a bit of a facade.  The flavours were shallow and not well balanced.    Again, I would not tell anyone to avoid the Mint Thai Cafe, however I am sure that I can find better Thai in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Oh perfected yellow curry... I have found you!!! I will admit, upon walking into this place, my first though was, \"Unmatched chairs and white lattice as decoration?\"  But after sitting my snobbish butt down and going over the menu, I began to warm up.  They have a whole page of curry dishes.  I will say again, a WHOLE PAGE of curry dishes! And on this page, I found my food holy grail.  Yellow curry.  So good. So good.  Seriously - it was cooked exactly as my Indonesian oma would churn out of her magical kitchen.  Luckily, every time I have been back, it has been w/ family who are able to order other things on the menu, as I am not.  I've had the Rama Beef (courtesy of my dad), which has a thick, heavy peanut sauce that will fill you up all it's own. Highly recommend it.  The chow mein with veggies (not so courteously from my sis), is amazing. Light for a noodle dish.  My seven year old ordered the fried tofu (he's a freak) and LOVED it!  We've had the same server every time, and I'm convinced she is pleasantly insane. Can't understand a word she says, but she gets our order right every time. It's amazing.  The wontons leave a bit to be desired. They came to us flat, a bit hard and with less than half a teaspoon of filling. But seriously, by the end of the meal, I'd forgotten about them.  Go here for Thai food. Seriously."}
{"text":"I drive 20-30 minutes just to have their Rama beef! The Tom Kha soup is also excellent. Wife likes the pad thai. Service can be slow but food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing curry.  Probably the best in the valley.  But it doesn't matter how good the food is because the service was horrible!  I haven't gone back because the service was so, so bad.  The waitress was rude, completely screwed up our order, and gave us no apologies.  I probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Tom yum gai soup is amazing and helps with cold or flu. I could eat this soup daily. It is savory and lemony and spicy. The yum yai salad is also a go to for me. The dressing is sweet and tangy and goes well with peanuts and eggs. Curry noodles are my favorite dish(I order it no onions). It's similar to an angel hair and it's almost a noodle soup. Mango and sticky rice or mint Thai pie are perfect endings to the meal. They have changed owners a lot over the years but those items that I mentioned are still ones I'd vouch for"}
{"text":"SOLID THAI!! Finally... Being from SoCal, I am SUPER spoiled when it comes down to authentic and delicious Asian cuisine. So needless to say, I've had some disappointments since moving to East Valley AZ... However, there's HOPE! Mint Thai came through on a rich and creamy Tom Kha Chicken soup  that satisfied my craving, and also helped me stave off a cold that I was coming down with. The Thai Toast appetizer and spring rolls were also quite delightful.  They did make a mistake on our order, but they addressed everything politely and quickly. I didn't try many items this time because I wasn't feeling the best, but the soup and customer service has ensured a return visit will be taking place in the future."}
{"text":"We've had Royal Thai in San Francisco which is fabulous, 5 Star in San Diego which was the best, and found Mint Thai Cafe years ago.  It's the best Thai food we've experienced here in AZ.   2.5 stars is the hottest we can go.  I don't know why people seem to always order items that are Americanized and not try the great (better) dishes they offer, like Rama Beef--YUM-OMG! or the Nam Sod--oh so delicious, the ginger, the lime, cilantro and it would be fantastic if they included mint, plus a side of the cucumber salad like we got at the SD restaurant.  So we always get Nam Sod, Massuman curry, rama, plus sometimes the satay.  Satay is fantastic but not as wonderful as shrimp satay (which we got in SD).  Too bad it's a drive, but still worth it.  The service is better (this is the 3rd owner (no more Mr. One eye) since we started there) and the atmosphere has improved with the renovation, but the prices have almost doubled."}
{"text":"First time at the Mint Thai Cafe tonight. Service was exceptional and food was very good. Had the Pad Thai Noodles and Susan had the Rice Down Under. We both enjoyed what we had and have enough left over for tomorrow. Had to save some room to try a dessert so we gave the Sticky Rice with Mango a try. The dessert was terrific! Always like to try new things. We will likely return."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food! Have been going for over 15 years, must get the Tom Ka Gai soup. My favorite is the Rama Chicken (peanut sauce), the best ever! Husband loves Gang Ped!"}
{"text":"I've been to this spot a few times.  We decided to order takeout.  My husband ordered his go to which is pad tai with chicken. I decided to order something different so I had the Tom yum gai soup. It was amazing. It is the perfect balance of heat, sweet, sour and creamy. I couldn't put it down.  The lemongrass and lime permeate the dish and its finished off with a hint of coconut cream. I could drink it up. My husband kept eating my soup because it was that tasty. If you don't like mushrooms then this isn't for you because they are filled with them.   The pad thai was also tasty. They even out the peanuts on the side of the dish for you to mix in which I can appreciate. If you get a chance eat here.  It's delicious and try the soup you will want seconds and thirds or maybe just a trough and a bib:)"}
{"text":"I hear this place used to be wonderful, and wished I had visited it then. Last week when I went  I found everything oily & flavorless.  My Pad Thai was grotesque - it tasted like they substituted vegetables for lard. As it sat uneaten it congealed into into a solid block.    I'm health conscious, so this is definitely off my list."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The owner's elderly mother often sits in a booth near the door and greets you with a sweet smile and a \"wai\".  Beautiful and oh-so charming.   And then you dine...  I've grown tired of being disappointed by highly-touted Chinese restaurants in The Valley that don't stack up, so I've begun seeking out Thai restaurants instead and have found my favorite.  I've dined at Mint Thai almost a dozen times without being disappointed.  I love spicy, and boy, do they know how to do spicy!  Can't think of a lunch or a dinner that wasn't perfect."}
{"text":"Love their curry noodles and spicy soup.  Their coconut ice cream with peanuts on top is delicious too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley!! The Rama Beef is a classic. Great Pad Thai! Panang curry is delicious. The Thai coffee with cream is to die for. Service is great. Food is amazing every time! Never had anything here that I did not like. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The hunt for good Thai in AZ continues.. Thank goodness this one's so close to the home, thank goodness it's soooo good!  The pad thai is light, balanced, in good proportions, was as spicy as I needed it to be, and has good presentation. It was not too dry or wet, which makes my  mouth water just thinking about it. Good thing I took leftovers!  I also got the red curry in spicy mode. Very very on point. A bigger bowl of more curry to scoop from (than Thai Rama), with rice. The blend of sweet, hot, and sour from the sauce, meat and potatoes mixes well with the steaming, fresh, soft rice. Kept going for 2nds and 3rds!   The only thing I would change is the number of waiters/waitresses they had. There was only one lady serving all 7-8 tables. She looked really too busy to stop by and ask how I was. Lucky for her I was too busy stuffing my face with goodness. There was an older lady busing, but they need maybe another person helping out in front of house. Just a thought. Too bad there's no 4.5 because it came really close to a 5 star."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I've been coming here for years (both dine in and take out) and have never been disappointed. If you love Thai food check this place out. Their Rama Beef is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my 15th review and my 1st 5-star rating.   I have been a major fan of Mint Thai for three plus years.  Their entire menu is off the charts good.  I learned about this place at the office where about 8 of us would get lunch to go and have a thai festival.  I have eaten at probably 18 thai restaurants in my life and this is the one that stands out above the rest!  The facility is clean and the service is awesome but its the food that knocks this place into the stratosphere.    The red, green, and panang curries are all awesome and the three colored fish has a very unique, sweet flavor.... But the winner of the prize at this joint is their Rama Beef... a peanut flavored sauce on thin slices of beef that is nothing like any Ram or Rama dish I have tried at any other Thai establishment.  This is the joint!"}
{"text":"I love the Mint Thai. I have always gotten the same meal there- the Golden Nests for appetizers and Green Curry Chicken for my meal -and I have never been disappointed! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of three on a Friday night around 845pm.  The first thing I hear when I get there is multiple tables complaining about the slow service.  I should have taken this as a sign. We ordered the stuffed chicken wings, fried wontons, and the Thai pork chops.  While the food wasn't anything to write home about, the service was slow, didn't provide silverware, and when we got plates they were dirty. The Thai tea was decent."}
{"text":"We saw this place a few times just driving by. We looked up the Yelp reviews today and gave it a shot. Whoa Nelly! This place is great! The ambiance is OK, the food was spectacular and the service was a little \"moody\" - but maybe she had a bad day and there was a slight language barrier.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were ample. We will return!  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I used to like coming here but there is one waitress that is so annoying that I won't be back.   The last time I had my baby along and she hovered for 10 minutes saying what a cute baby he was.  I think she wanted a big tip  and was trying to butter me up.  It's really annoying to try and eat your food while a stranger is hovering over you.  So if you don't' mind a strange person waiting on you then be my guest."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place one day when I was craving dumplings. My husband and I loved them so much they are now the standard for all other places. We went back for dinner sharing the Pad Thai  with chicken and beef and Drunken noodles with shrimp. The flavor of the pad Thai was strong with a great mix of sweet and spicy.  My husband preferred the chicken over the beef because the chicken has more of the flavor from the sauce. I like that they put the peanuts on the side so you can add as much or little as you like. The drunken noodles were cooked perfectly, the shrimp were large and deveined so nicely. Can't wait to come back and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"This is hands down the absolute worst Thai food I have ever had. My husband got the spicy cashew lunch special with brown rice. He described it as bland. I tasted it and can say it is hands down the most disgusting dish I have ever tasted. I got the Pad See Ewe that was absolutely tasteless. It was dry and had no spice although it was supposed to. My husband bit into the egg roll that comes with the lunch special and immediately said, \"This is not even edible.\" He described it as being like biting into a dirty oil filter. It was that gross. This meal was a total waste of money. If you want good Thai food, look elsewhere. This was a pick up order. If we had been at the restaurant we would have sent it back."}
{"text":"We found this Thai place after trying to decide on a place to eat.  We were impressed with the food.  It's a slow paced but relaxing environment.  We had panang, yellow and green curry.  The sauces were very thick and flavorful.  The spice level was perfect.  We had sticky rice and cyst for desert also yummy!!  We eat Thai a lot and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"You won't find better Thai food in Phoenix.  I've never been disappointed, the service is great, the drinks are delicious.  Also!  They have Jolly Ranchers at the cash register.  Yes!  Very well priced."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant, good food, food service!! Homemade food, and I loved the grand mom. She is 94 :)"}
{"text":"The second I stepped into the Mint Thai Café, I was surrounded by Thai culture. Thai music filled the small restaurant. The restaurant was decorated with elephants as well as common Hindu symbols and art. The tables were covered with fabrics of colorful patterns. Curtains of the same fabric covered the windows and entrances to the kitchen and bathrooms. The back wall was painted of a Thai beach. My family and I were greeted by a small Thai hostess who asked with a friendly smile, \"how many?\" and then proceeded to lead my family of five to a table, while she held a conversation about how our day was. She even tried to make my little sister laugh, which was unsuccessful because my sister is quite shy, but it was still nice having such a friendly waitress. Since the restaurant was small and not very busy, our waitress was fully attentive and took care of our every want and need right away. The service was amazing!   First, my family ordered a large soup called Tom Ka Gai. The soup included chicken, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc. The soup had the perfect spicy kick to it, while having an amazing flavor, too. I definitely recommend this to all customers! Next, our entrées arrived. I ordered the Siamese Twins which was a green curry. It included chicken, bamboo shoots, Thai leaves, green beans, and white rice. The sauce was, just like the soup, the perfect combination of a spicy kick and a tasty flavor! It was so delicious, I cleared my whole plate!   The Mint Thai Café is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and it is my favorite. I plan to dine here many more times in the future and I suggest lovers of Thai and spicy food take the time and eat there. Not only was the food amazing, but so was the service and the environment. You walk into a pure and friendly Thai culture, which a lot of restaurants around here do not have. It is also small and not too busy so it is nice being away from big crowds and loud areas. I recommend the Mint Thai Café to all."}
{"text":"Great Thai place. My friend who lived in Thailand for a while says that the food here is just as good as it is in the country. I find it delicious as well. I prefer the Brown curry and the red curry both are great. the spiciness of the food is exponential though. Im Indian and i usually get 3 starts out of 4 but when you order 4 stars it will make you cry. I would recommend for most people 2 stars and for the week 1 star."}
{"text":"Had the Tom Ka Gai and it was great! Very flavorful and a good price. My colleafue had a seafood curry that look awesome (I want to try it next time). Waitress was so friendly and quick to serve everything. I plan to come back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for green tea, dumplings, and curry so I went to Mint Thai Cafe in Gilbert, Arizona.  I had forgotten about my first visit two years ago when I was with a group and somehow didn't get served when everyone else did so I left.  This time I was served salty tea.  , When I complained I was told it wasn't green tea and they would give me green tea.  Again, the water was salty.  The dumplings arrived but the soy sauce was especially loaded with vinegar.  When I complained an asian man was sent to my table.  He screamed at me for complaining about the food.  At that point, I asked him to lower his voice and give me the bill for the one egg roll I consumed.  He screamed no! and walked off.  I waited for the bill, but then the waitress told me to leave which I did.  Mint Tai Cafe has a sign on its door that says, \"#1 Rated Thai Food in Arizona.  That wasn't true for me twice.  I have tanned skin.  It's a shame how racists are bullying businesses in Gilbert to discriminate against certain people.  Gilbert was a much nicer town before Trump was elected."}
{"text":"First time I tried the place.  Th spring rolls were good, but the Pad Thai had zero flavor and zero spice. Also no ordered the sizzling beef, and I couldnt figure out whether the flavors went well together, or were just plain weird.  Definitely better Thai places in Gilbert, and I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Very gross food. Ordered yellow curry with tofu and added broccoli. Charged four dollars total for added broccoli, of which each curry only had 2-3 pieces. Curry was not creamy, semi translucent and lacked any flavor. Tofu and potato terribly undercooked, potato felt and tasted raw. Spring rolls were not crispy and very mushy inside. Will never go back and will continue to get my yellow curry from Thai Basil in Tempe."}
{"text":"We've been going to Mint Thai for the last five years. The food is consistently wonderful, flavor and they have large portions.  I never leave hungry.  I am sold on their Thai Iced Tea and order a small size to try and be \"good.\"  I down that quickly and then order a second and wonder why I didn't order the larger size to begin with!  My favorite dishes are the Crispy Noodles with Chicken (No. 63) and the Silver Noodles with Chicken (No. 33).     The service has deteriorated over the last year or so. We really miss Christine.   But, you can tell they are trying to get it right and effort goes a long way with me.  They always have kind words for my son and many times will bring out a trinket or cute little something as a parting gift for him.  I just wished we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go for the first time today.  I got spicy cashew chicken, hot.  It wasn't too hot I think next time I may get extra hot.  The vegetables that came in it were good.  I liked the chicken it was white meat and perfect size pieces.  The man who took my money was very nice.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Curry Noodle, Green Curry, and Rama Chicken or Beef we have ordered for years and although the prices keep going up for the dishes, the flavor and the spice  of each are awesome.  We always get take out and have never dined there but we probably should.  Highly recommended for authentic Thai Food!"}
{"text":"Prices are very reasonable for Thai cuisine. We went for the lunch special for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. The soup we had for the lunch special was a bit bland but it wasn't horrible, the entree was absolutely delicious and the eggrolls are some of the best I have had here in the valley. I wish the owners would keep the place a little cooler on a 113 degree day, but I can live with it. All in all this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"First time here.   Called in an order.  Lady was semi rude on phone.   But thought maybe they're busy.     She tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.   I show up 25 minutes later.  And it's still not ready.  I'm thinking okay..  I can understand,  maybe they messed up the food or whatever.     I'm writing this at 40 minutes after I called,(15 min sitting down waiting).   There are only 3 tables and the ladies aren't even checking on me or apologizing.   Regardless of how good the food is.  Never coming back.  UPDATE : 30 min after arriving I finally receive my food.   No sorry or anything.  Absolutely ludicrous!!i could of cooked pad Thai myself faster and cheaper.  Pissed."}
{"text":"Beyond horrible waitress , rude even when you try to be nice to her. We also asked about the lunch special being as it was 2:55 (dinner price begins at 3). She said no it was dinner time. I didn't want to argue with her but throughout the meal she was extremely rude no matter how kind we were to her. The food came out at a reasonable time and was decent. But the service from that particular waitress is why we will never return."}
{"text":"The Thai fried rice, drunken noodles and pad Thai are all very good.  I love spicy food and this restaurant doesn't shy away from spicing it up if you order 4 spicy.  The service is great.  The atmosphere is not why you'd choose to eat here, but if you are looking for authentic delicious Thai food you've found the right place."}
{"text":"I havn't quite gotten into Thai food so that is why I am listing this as A Ok as the food was just ok in my opinion. For someone that loves Thai food though, this might be a terrific place. I had the yellow chicken curry with rice and my friend had the red chicken curry with rice. Both were ok but I liked the red better. They were served with some kind of soup which was not memorable for me. Probably a place worth giving a try if you like Thai. The atmosphere was a bit dark and old. I don't remember the pricing being bad either."}
{"text":"Sorry to write this bad review. The quality of the food is not there. Their Pad Thai tasted like dog food. Yes, dog food which both me and my husband agreed on.  The Shrimp Fried Rice is ok. Shrimp are fresh, but the fried rice was't cook right. The two lunches we ordered, Green Curry & Basil Chicken, are the two better dishes we had that afternoon.  We would not go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for authentic Thai food, we've been coming here for years! Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the meager strip mall location and the simple decor. The Thai food here will delight your taste buds. When they offer the pumpkin curry, get it--fantastic! They also do a great job with coconut shrimp and pad thai, and they make a killer Thai iced tea. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Around Thanksgiving, we went to Mint Thai for lunch (it being our usual thai lunch spot). What a mess. The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything. In the end, out of a party of 4, only 1 of us had received what we ordered, 1 of us was violently ill (and remained so for DAYS - having to visit the doctor, etc), 2 of us felt moderately ill later, and only one of us felt ok. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I just moved here from CA and was craving Thai food. I ordered the yellow curry and Thai iced tea for takeout. They told me my order would be ready in 5min.  This definitely makes me wonder how much of it was made ahead of time. For the price the quality is decent-good and the quantity is generous."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day with a friend and I've heard good things about this restaurant many times. I was not disappointed, just not quite as impressed as I have been with some other local thai places.   Service was not bad at all that day, but my friend let me know it can be a little slow at times. The lunch buffet was great, I think it was around seven bucks per plate and the portions were generous.   I had the green curry with chicken and ordered a mild spice limit. The dish was a little bland when I got it and perhaps thats just because im not used to the spice levels in this restaurant. Other places I've ordered a 2 out of 10 and barely managed to eat it due to spiciness. Other than that the dish was good, vegetables cooked to a nice crisp, rice well cooked, chicken yummy. The tofu soup they included and the egg role weren't too bad either. Again, not super memorable but good.   Maybe next time I'll try another dish and a different spice level and see if I've missed out on what everyone is loving about this place. Overall, a good solid Thai place, just not going to become one of my local favs."}
{"text":"Very weird service.  Good soups.  Terrible pad thai.  Delicious sticky rice with mangos.  Consistency is definitely a problem here.  Eccentricity is not."}
{"text":"We have had dinner here twice now and both times the food was very good as was the service. We can recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the curry here, but the service left something to be desired.  My friend and I ordered the same thing and it took about 45 minutes for us to get our food.  The waitress blamed it on the cooks, but I have a suspicion that she just forgot to put in the order.  Good for the food, just ignore the service."}
{"text":"I have tried many different Thai places in the East Valley and this has been my tride and true. I am consistently pleased with the food and the staff! The atmosphere is nice and makes dining there a joy. I encourage anyone to try the Thai Custard dessert. Its my favorite!"}
{"text":"The portions *seem* okay, but actually they aren't that great (they really cheap out on meat).  I've given them a couple chances, but both times I've been very disappointed by how stingy they can be -- it's almost all sauce! Come on, Mint Thai, you can do better than that! I can understand being frugal with seafood, but ...chicken?   It's not just with their entrees, but with their beverages. I got a $3.95 Thai tea which was 3/4 ice...on one of the coldest days of December. Is the tea made of gold? Mint Thai, for what special occasion are you squirreling away this cheap beverage?  Sigh. It's tasty overall, but I just feel awful paying the same price as other Thai restaurants for *truly* half the food."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Great Pad Thai! The curry was delicious.Our server was very nice and brought extra rice for my daughters to take home to eat the next day with the sauce from the curry they ordered because they loved it so much! My favorite was the Tom Yum soup! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just ate dinner here and it was AMAZING!! We got pad Thai, stir fry noodles with beef (chow mein), crispy rolls, and mango sticky rice. We loved every single bite. We wouldn't change anything and are open to trying something new next time but will have a hard time not getting the same thing. Oh soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mint Thai for more than 20 years, I've even been to Thailand...this place is one of my favorites.  It is a bit of a \"whole-in-the-wall,\" but the food is great at a good value.  I love the Pumpkin Curry with chicken.  The homemade coconut ice cream is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here yesterday and I was really impressed by how quickly the food was ready. I ordered the Lard Na (#61) and it was amazing. The sauce was delicious and the beef was really good quality. The veggies were also cooked perfectly (not too firm, not too mushy). I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants around town. Their Pad Thai is excellent, decent portion size - my boyfrined love this dish called The Siamese Twins - chicken and shrimp dish with bamboo in a green curry sauce - YUMMY!  It is kind of located in an awkward location - but don't let that discourage you. Definitely a great place to go when you are craving Thai!"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. The service, however, is not. I would blame the kitchen for being slow to cook, but the lady who is usually there is slow right off the bat. She rivals certain servers at King Tuts in slowness. If she was fighting a Predator, I think she would win by just starving him out or hiding in the back until the Predator got bored of waiting and blew himself up or went and found a Xenomorph to fight instead. Anyway, I'm pretty sure she's the owner. She's always there.  Get the red curry noodles. They are the obvious star of the show."}
{"text":"I am sorry to have to give this place a bad review but my experience last night was pretty bad.  I ordered food to go, it cost me around $11 bucks for a plate.  I ordered cashew chicken and got 4/5 hot.  I get the food home and was starving at this point.  The entree was basically soup; so soupy it was very messy to eat!  Not much chicken, good degree of hotness, too many onions, and I swear there were no cashews.  The white rice also didn't taste right to me, but that's easy to get wrong.  After I ate it all I was still hungry and basically NOT very satisfied.  For $11 bucks I would have done better to eat panda express if I was craving some sort of asian.  The best part?  I believe they use MSG or too much salt or something, after eating I developed a severe headache which I went to bed with.  After drinking tons of water I hoped it would be better in the morning.  I was dead wrong.  This morning I woke up with a migraine and the same salty taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of from last night; I've never been sensitive to headaches in the past but today is simply unbearable.  For the money I would definitely advise avoiding this place.  Sorry Mint Thai!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Mint Thai? This is definitely one of my favorite Thai food restaurants in the Phoenix area. I little family run place with affordable prices and very good food! This is where I first fell in love with Mussaman Curry! They make a great one here with potatoes, shredded beef, peanuts and onions! The appetizers are really good as well my favorites being peanut satay and their spring rolls! The Thai Iced Tea is about three sizes bigger than most places. They don't skimp on portions here! I'm a fan for sure!"}
{"text":"Call me sheltered, but I'd never had coconut in anything that wasn't sweet before I ate at Mint Thai :)  I was with a client and he ordered. I remember I was SO apprehensive about trying the new and weird-sounding dishes he chose! I know, I am revealing how *white* I am. But, the point of the story is, thanks to Mint Thai, now I am positively addicted to Thai and anything with coconut milk in particular!   Mint Thai Cafe is cute, clean, although only average ambiance and service. The dishes I have tried are all very tasty. Try the Satay, Tom Yum Gui, Thai BBQ chicken, and all of their curries. Mmmm.... coconut....."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and this is our closest Thai spot. We got the usual Red Curry which was amazing the first time. 2nd time was not so amazing. Nothing awful about it, it taste good but was not consistent with the first try which was 100%!! Also tried the Pad Thai which was awesome!! Over all we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, I was disappointed at the lack of nutritious vegetables in our lunch. I got about two cups of white rice, one piece of tomato and three pieces of potatoes, some gross gelatinous tofu and a bowl of coconut milk. My husband had a plate of noodles, tofu and bean sprouts. Would love to have had a bunch of broccoli or peas. No wonder there are so many diabetics in the U.S.  The waitress has such a thick accent I couldn't understand her and scowled the entire time.  I'd rather of eaten at Pei Wei. They have the yummiest, chewiest, tastiest tofu with gobs of vegetables and BROWN rice!!!!! I was actually nauseous an hour after I ate."}
{"text":"The location was great for us, since it was really close to our house. However, the food wasn't the best or worst of all Thai places we've eaten. They were really nice to us and the service was excellent, but that may be due to the fact that there were no other customers. They were able to adjust the food spicy-ness for us, and it was definitely a 12 on the 10 point scale they give for spicy-ness.      Our only complaint is for the saucy-ness of the pad tai which was waay too saucy. And the Thai ice tea which was waay too sweet and syrupy tasting."}
{"text":"It was our first time there. The waitress was really rude and rushed us so badly. She was busy , which is fine. We  totally understand about her being so busy. When she came up to the table she gave me 1 min to speak and then rushed  me .. She forced my order and it was wrong . So I fixed it. She was so mean about it .. I was in shock.. :/:(. She was so aggressive and she was pissed off, the strangest thing I have ever seen at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was grateful that they accepted my take out order right at 9pm.But when I got the bill it was a whopping TEN dollars more than I had expected!I didn't have my reading glasses with me so I was unable to read the cashiers itemized list.So I just went ahead and paid it.I grabbed a Togo menu and re-checked my total.I had been correct.I was overcharged just under ten bucks.I was not too excited over the taste of my entrees either.The Yum Pla Murk salad has raw squid,That was not clarified in the menu.I won't be going back.I can't afford it."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped for lunch on a Saturday.  The place was pretty dead, but I've been to plenty of empty Thai places that are amazing, so not a big deal.  The decor is kind of strange, but that's nothing new with Thai places either.  We were seated immediately and a few minutes later our server came to take our order.  I ordered the Pad See Ew with fried tofu, spice level medium hot (my go to dish).  I told her I wanted it spicy, but not crazy spicy.  My mom ordered the Yellow Curry (mild) with fried tofu and an iced tea.  Our server wasn't very friendly....kind of short with us.  Seemed impatient.  Anyway, food comes out.  It's like mine had not taste.  No heat, no flavor, nothing.  It was honestly the worst Pad See Ew I've ever had.  My mom never got her iced tea either.  I have my go to Thai places, but I'm always eager to try a new spot but sadly, I'll never return to this one."}
{"text":"GAVE 2 STARs -  I do not like to downgrade a restaurant that has been a favororite for years BUT...   For our appetizer: Our first disappointment for the evening, but not the last. The eggrolls have gone down in size to a fraction of what we got before.    NO RICE - We have been going to MINT THAI for years and years.  Over 20 to be exact... but recently on our visit they brought our favorite dish #50 SIAMESE TWINS with chicken and shrimp... and said, anything else?  We said... yes the RICE to eat this curry dish with, they said, well there is an EXTRA CHARGE for rice!!!! ??  This dish is not cheap around $12.00 and no rice? What THAI restaurant... does not give rice with their CURRY dishes?  We have been to many around the valley, because WE LOVE THAI.  WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED, with MINT THAI, has it changed hands.???   We LIVE NEARBY, will go to some others we like.  Mint has become to pricey, and not customer friendly.  Sign us, sad in Mesa."}
{"text":"We tried this place with friends on Saturday night. It was delicious!!!! Myself and hubby ordered the Curry Noodles. I asked for mine hot and hubby asked for thai hot. Both of us agreed it could of been hotter. But we LOVE spice so it's probably just us. We also ordered the Fried wontons for an appetizer and those were tasty as well. All of us really enjoyed this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Our server was trying to sell us \"dinner\" price instead of the \"lunch special.\" One of our order comes with an egg roll and soup but our server forgot the egg roll. She never checked on us. She just looks so mad. This was our first time here and it wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. You get some great Thai food with fresh ingredients for a great price. One of the ladies that runs the place was very friendly. Her personality made the meal all the more enjoyable. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was very good and it came out quickly.  Only issue was the waitress, had to ask for two menus, then we ordered two beers but only got one, then getting enough to go boxes was challenging."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 20 years! I love this place. Great food, polite service, just the BEST!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on since 2001.  No frills, and the decor and overall environment is outdated - but the food is consistently yummy.  Not the best around, but I can always count on having my taste buds satisfied at this place.  The prices are quite reasonable, and the staff is friendly (although a little difficult to understand at times due to a language barrier).  Try the sticky rice and Thai iced tea or coffee for an extra treat."}
{"text":"Decent food, pretty decent service...but it was hot in the restaurant, the medium had no spice whatsoever (although my husband appreciated that), and the service was a little slow. Maybe, if there is a next time, it will be better."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was in high school and that's about 10 years ago now. The food still tastes exactly the same as it did back then and that's one of the things I love about this place! Consistency in taste is important to me.  My favorites are their Thai Fried Rice, Pad Thai and Curry Noodles! Be careful with their spicy scale because I absolutely LOVE super spicy food but their Thai Hot is too much, even for me (which is rare).  In terms of service, they have ladies from Thailand that work the register and wait tables. You have to cut them a bit of slack. Their English is very poor and sometimes it is hard to understand what they're saying, but they're sweet and all I really care about is the food quality and taste. :) This is definitely my favorite Thai place in Arizona... Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I loved the peaceful environment, the food was excellent and everyone there was just casual and peaceful. One thing I liked, they don't bother you a lot while you're enjoying the cuisine which is worth every penny. Our dinner for two cost around $28 + tip. I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Service great,  decor a step above the Valley norm and presentation make this one of the best all round Thai meals I've had in the region.   Thai hot? Sorry but Touch of Thai and The Thai house  in the north  and the north west of Phoenix respectively equal them and I had stressed me craving/ need/ addiction to experience such. I.E.,That's why I was at a Thai place to begin with since Indian eateries appear to have conceded their heat advantage to pander to local tastes.  . It tasted really good though and only decorum , and a wife that would have stabbed me for doing this, prevented me from licking out the bowl:)   The ginger dish that my partner had was very very  light in the ginger department but was pretty good otherwise and everything was as fresh as I've seen within the valley.  So is it worth a 30 mile drive on a regular basis? Not based on this single experience but it's good enough to  my Thai go to when in the region."}
{"text":"We loved this place.   I tried brown curry for the first time-with tofu and a couple other things in it.   It was so good.   I'm going back with my husband next time."}
{"text":"I wrote a review under another account, but this one is mainly for restaurants.   Just went to Mint Thai again recently...I have been going there for more than 20 years and have even been to Thailand (so I think I know a thing or two about Thai food)...this place is one of my favorites!   Mint Thai is a bit of a \"whole-in-the-wall,\" but the food is great at a good value.  I love the Pumpkin Curry with chicken.  The homemade coconut ice cream is a must for dessert."}
{"text":"This was the first Thai I have had and it did not disappoint.  I went to Mint Thai with my in-laws, who love the place, so I had high expectations. It's a nice restaurant, with ample seating, and a good atmosphere. The menu can be a little intimidating. Each dish is numbered, named, and has a description, and there are something like 70+ dishes to choose from, plus spiciness options, so it can be kind of hard especially for a newbie.  I picked something in the 60s with chicken and red curry. It was really delicious, with unique flavors and a good spiciness. My only difficulty was that my food was basically swimming in the sauce. I ended up packing some up to take home, and ended up with a plate still full of sauce.  Other than that, this place was delicious. If only it weren't so far away, so I could try more of their options."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! I had the cashew chicken with brown rice. I will come here again for sure."}
{"text":"I got the Fried rice here and it was really good. The price you pay for what you get is ridiculous, because the food is such a big portion for a cheaper price. Like I had a mountain of fried rice. Service is good, but server have a really straight up and firm personality, however she is still very attentive and welcoming. The only thing that is off about this place that the decorations seems very old. When it's empty, it just look very old and boring and not a lot of excitement. The walls are decorated with a few Thai decorations, but mostly just empty walls and the chair/booth are not appealing in my opinion. Pump up the decorations and this place could get a 5 Stars!! NOTE: the servers get paid hourly , so they don't receive the tip you gave them, the tip goes straight to the owners. I don't know how much they get paid hourly, but once server told me to keep the tip bc she wouldn't be able to receive them."}
{"text":"The food tastes all right, but I prefer Thai Rama better.  I don't think the number of times we've gone here that we've ever gotten really good service and I would have to say maybe it's on the subpar side - Service 2 star, Food 4 star, so it averages to 3 Stars.  This restaurant has been around a long time, probably for over 20 years.  I think when I went with my white husband way back when, we were treated better than when I go with my Asian family.  Maybe Asians like to treat Asians poorly.  I don't know, but that's not good.  We don't come here very often because who wants to feel aggravated when they eat, even if it's good food."}
{"text":"We ate here once and will never go back. Overpriced for Chinese, service was really slow, and the food was \"iffy\" at best. The Pad Thai had no flavor. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is atrocious. Definitely worth braving crappy service, one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"This place pretty good . A bit pricey especially for 4 spring rolls that are cut in half. I think those were almost $9  . I had the panang curry which was really good. I think I picked a level 7 of hotness and it was not hot enough for me. So overall good Thai food. Brown rice wAs yummy too. Thai tea was ok and over priced for the amount they give you. Server was nice but very hard to understand."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in two weeks, mainly due to convenience in errand running. I'm a creature of habit and always order Pad Se Ew at every Thai restaurant I frequent, and did no different at this restaurant (haha)! On both occasions we also ordered the Vegetable Soup. It was presented in a steel bowl type container that allows a flame to emit to keep the soup hot [I'll attempt to attach a picture to compensate for my poor description :)]. On the first occasion the soup was amazing and the Pad See Ew was just ok. On the second occasion the soup was just ok and the Pad See Ew was amazing.   The atmosphere is quite casual, nothing too fancy. My first visit I was not sure whether or not to seat myself, so I just waited a while (haha). The staff is very nice, and the little boy that runs around in a Cardinals jersey is adorable!  My brother really enjoys the food, so I'm sure I will be back again and I hope the soup and Pad See Ew are both amazing on the next visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! It was our first time eating Thai food and our server gave us wonderful recommendations. When we left she even gave us a menu to take with us and had marked the meals we had eaten along with a few others she recommended we try next visit. She was so very helpful and the food was just as impressive! It was our first time and will definitely not be our last."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  Definitely the worst Thai food I've ever had.  Went in with 2 friend's. They ordered pepper steak.  It came out looking like soup, the meat was terribly overcome and tasteless.   the soup they served with the luncheon special was very spicy which they failed to tell us.  One of my friend s does not eat Spicy food.  I ordered chicken massaman which I've ordered in at least 15 different restaurants and have never seem tomatoes in it before.  The taste was horrible.  Needless to say, won't ever go back there again.  Just wish I could have given them zero stars"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out, so can't comment on the atmosphere. The food was solid, but not extraordinary. There was a Thai couple paying for their meal when I arrived to pick up my food, so that must be a good sign, right?"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it's always been amazing. It's one of my go to spots in the area, inside is very quiet and nice. Service is nice and fast."}
{"text":"It took me a while to warm up to Mint Thai Cafe. I'm a huge Thai fan but there are certain dishes I love that they don't serve here. Recently I found out that they serve Pad Kee Mao, though it isn't on the menu, and it's great. Their Green Bean Special (something like Pad Prik King) is really good, though not the traditional style I'm used to, and their eggplant dish is superb. Overall they are a really good restaurant with a great atmosphere, though I found their Mango Sticky-rice a bit gummy and when Mango is out of season they offer Jack-fruit. Though I appreciate their honesty with the mango (nothing worse than gamey or unripe mango!) the jack fruit just wasn't good at all. Overall a good restaurant, but only now my go-to-for-thai after certain other closures in the area."}
{"text":"I have eaten their food about 50 times. But I do always get it to go so I can't say much about the dining experience or service.   It's by far my favorite food. I do always get curry so I can't speak for the other dishes. I have tried several different curries. Yellow, red, Penang and I usually get massaman.  When you get it to go they box it and bag it up nice so it makes it home without making a mess I your car.   I only wish this place didn't look so drab from the outside. I guess the inside isn't a spectacle either."}
{"text":"The Thai food here was good. I had massaman curry and my fiancé had pad thai. His rocked, the sauce was thick. My curry was great, and you can get glass noodles which for some reason is hard to sub out at other places. The Thai Ice tea was really really good!"}
{"text":"Came in around 7:45. Waitress asks if we are doing carry out and acts quite miffed when we say that we want to eat in. They close at 9 so....?   When she brought our water glasses, she banged them on the table with visible agitation.   I looked over the menu for a few minutes, more contemplating this lady's rudeness than the selections.  When she returned after a few minutes I hadn't yet made up my mind as to what I was going to order and told her so apologetically and with a smile, and she gave this look of disdain, anger, gosh, I don't know what....scary.    We left."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting for my food. How can I give a 5 star review without even tasting my food? Because I was asking if the dish I ordered had any meat or dairy products in it and she assured there was none, and before giving me my food she mentioned it had eggs and if I was ok with that. She said the noodles had eggs, and I said that the website said it had rice noodles. She had the dish 're made for me without a question so I would leave happy. Thank you so much for the kindness and consideration!     Bonus, free side of egg rolls for my husband!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner. Excellent food and wonderful service by some very nice folks"}
{"text":"The best Green curry chicken I have had in a long time. Not much for ambiance, but it's a great take out place. They are very accomadating to special dietary needs and have really good brown rice-upon request and will even add tofu to various dishes. I prefer to NOT eat in, as the staff is very difficult to understand and a bit too chatty! If it was located in a nicer building and had better ambiance, I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"This place needs an A/C.  I'm not going to visit this place between the months of June and August until they do."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mint Thai for over 10 years.  The food has gone up and down over that time, but it's been pretty good throughout.  The service is always good, and it's a pretty kid friendly place.  Since discovering Latitude 8 in downtown Chandler, we don't go to Mint Thai as much anymore, but we still go by every once in a while."}
{"text":"I picked up some takeout here this evening.  I wondered if I had gone to a totally different restaurant than the 4 star Mint Thai I had visited several months ago.  On the one hand maybe they are having an off night.  On the other hand maybe they have dropped significantly in quality since my first dining experience.  If you would kindly lend me yet another hand, I have run across restaurants where the take out food is like a totally different restaurant.  Maybe Mint Thai is one of those places.  There is a trend down and to the right in the reviews..."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little hidden gem in gilbert.  Pros: great food and flavor! I am not a fan of super spicy food and this place is able to deliver great tasting thai food without burning your mouth off! The inside is never busy, even on a saturday night.   Cons: they dont deliver and that is a real bummer. The inside is a really strange set up. There is odd placement of curtains and really bright lighting. There is also the family who probably owns it sitting around the resturant.   My advice get the yellow curry and take it home and watch some netflix. Now that sounds like a good night!!"}
{"text":"The hubby suggested this place since he knows I love my Asian food and this was his first time trying Thai food. It was a cozy place and we were greeted as soon as we walked in however there was only one other family sitting in a booth.  We already knew what we were going to order since the menu was available online.  The food arrive quickly and our waitress was attentive and friendly. The food was good but nothing spectacular.  I'd go back again though and try the curry."}
{"text":"Great first experience.  Loved the Thai tea & soup.  Chicken rice was delicious too. Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"I enjoy their Rama Chicken. Their peanut sauce is great. However, their service is slow. It is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long. If they improved their service my rating  would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I really love the food here!!!  Everything and anything that I have ever ordered has been amazing, but I can honestly say that my order has very rarely been exactly what I've ordered...? That's the only reason I can't give Mint Thai a full 5 stars.  The service here is terrible!!!  I am hardly ever one to complain about service, but when I do it's usually here on Yelp to help fellow members to society. Upon entering the restaurant I always have my fingers crossed that someone other then \"that waitress\" is working. Never fails, she's always there!!! Ugh!!!   If you are just looking for great food, this is the place!!! But if you want wonderful customer service too, you are not going to find it here."}
{"text":"I usually get the pad Thai and it is sooo good. This place was my go to for Thai food. As of lately the pad Thai looks and tastes like it has been sitting out. Not sure what's going on but the lady on the phone has a chip on her shoulder. Probably won't eat here for a while."}
{"text":"I gave them 4 stars, since the service was a bit off however, I would have to say the food was good defiantly worth a return visit. Reasonable on price witch is a pleasant surprise. Lost the 5 star since the service was nothing I've ever experienced once you get past that your in for a treat with dim lighting and good food. Not the best but very good!"}
{"text":"Worst worst Thai food , we came visit family and we wanted to try some Thai food decided to try this place and omg it had 4 stars not good at all my pad Thai was so sweet and their egg rolls had no flavor and it seems like the vegetables in the egg rolls was so mushy.   We are from California we wanted to try some good Thai food and this is not the best Thai food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai spot.   Ambiance is good, much better than any other E. Valley Thai spot, the service is prompt and very friendly.  We spent about 15 minutes after our meal chatting it up with the owner.  They really make you feel welcome.  The food is excellent. I love Thai food due to the complex flavors that they use in their dishes.  Sweet, savory, spicy, vinegary all come together in a wonderful way.  Mint Thai's flavors are superior and the way their dishes are presented just adds to the eating experience.  I had their Laarb (excellent), Shrimp Red Curry (excellent), Spicy Fried Rice (average... not flavorful), and Mango with Sticky Rice (excellent).  I gave them a pass on the Spicy Fried Rice.  For me, it wasn't flavorful enough.... I should have just splashed some fish sauce on it.  Their other dishes were so good and so much better than other places they still get a 4-star review, even with average fried rice.  I just won't order the Spicy Rice next time."}
{"text":"Veggie Tom Ka is on point....try the curry noodles. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Silky, spicy, sumptuous . . . tom kai gai.  Truly the premiere piping hot pot of soup in the Valley. Chicken, kaffir lime, coconut milk, lemongrass and ginger deliver fireworks on the taste buds.  The service is attentive but not stalker; the decor is primarily traditional with golden splashes and photos of dignitaries. It's quaint, inviting and tucked away on the east side of Gilbert Road.  Over the years, I sampled my way through the menu and adamantly recommend the green curry (gang kew wan) as your main course at a very reasonable $10. Or, for a special seaside treat, opt for the seafood green curry at $15.  Kick up the spice to your heart's desire, and relish the thought of sweet sticky rice with Thai custard as the close to a delightful culinary escapade. Of course, don't forget the Thai iced tea to escort the flavors to your soon-to-be exuberant tummy.  Feel like sharing? Portion sizes are primed for a combo with your fave dinner companion."}
{"text":"The female server is on the borderline crazy but she is really fun to be with.  It is the Thai notion of being playful without offending customers which mean if you like a serious server--this would not be the place for you.  The food is good like a typical Thai place but their prices can be in the high side.  Dinner for both us with the appetizer (fish cake and combo amuse bouche, two dinner entree, plus a papaya salad) will set you back $72 dollars.  We got the special deal that knock $25 off but with 18% tip turns out to be $60 dollars.  It is on the expensive side..If the money isn't a object, this will be the place for you for a fun meal with a chatty, and a flirty waitress."}
{"text":"I really don't know what all of the hype is about this place. The service was not the best. Our waitress stood at our booth until we placed our order even after my husband said we needed a few more moments to decide. The curry was not the greatest and I was left very unsatisfied with my meal. My husband didn't seem to like his meal either. The portions were very small and not worth the price we paid. We will not return"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, and I remember it being better. I had the Yellow Curry and it was a bit too soupy for my taste. Daughter did like the dumplings, and husband enjoyed the Pad Thai. It really was just so-so though. Service was good, but that was only because we were in there with 2 other parties."}
{"text":"Oh so good, so so good. I've been looking for good Thai food ever since traveling through Thailand last year. This place really hit the mark.  The Laarb was fantastic and quite spicy, just the way it should be. It was presented really beautifully with cabbage leaves and sprigs of mint leaves. I ordered the Red Curry with mixed vegetables and shrimp. Yum. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and the curry was delicious.  Mangoes and sticky rice for dessert too. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So happy to have found another great Thai restaurant in the east valley!   Pad see-ew was delish! My husband ordered the Siamese twins. Mmmm perfect amount of curry for a super taster (me). We had our 6 yr old son with us and he gobbled up the Pad see-ew  too. I was surprised with how quick we received our order and the portions were just the right size for a little sharing. We will definitely be back to try more entrees!"}
{"text":"Great food!  PROS--Great food, laid back atmosphere.  Price is great, and there are plenty of options on the menu.  Portions are big as well.    CONS--Close a little early, but other than that, the everything was just fine.   I've been to many Thai restaurants where I live, and all are pricey and come with small portions.  Not so here.  I will be back if I'm ever in the area again."}
