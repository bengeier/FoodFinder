{"text":"We had a great dinner and fantastic service.  I had been a little concerned about reading some of the reviews about lack of service, but we had incredible service from Tony.  He kept my water glass full (I drink a lot of water) without ever being prompted. We had chicken satay appetizer - which was very tasty.  The peanut sauce was a little skimpy, but Tony immediately brought more when we asked.  Husband liked his trout, and I really enjoyed my salmon with loaded baked potato (yes it is loaded!)  As recommended by someone else, we LOVED the key lime pie.   Yes we'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The reviews are all over the place on this restaurant and we now understand why. Our service was ok, we had to wait quite awhile for our server but another server stepped in and made up for it by taking our drink orders. The drinks were absolutely amazing, with the best Caesar I've ever had, and then our food was horrible. My husband's $40 filet was ordered medium and came BURNED, with soggy mushrooms. My swordfish was dry and tasteless and my roasted cauliflower was also burned.  We had waited so long for food at that point that we just ate part of it and left, with no desire to try for a better food.  Conclusion: great atmosphere and drinks, terrible overpriced food."}
{"text":"We just stopped by and thought we would try Chop.  We got a great seat at the bar as soon as we walked on.  Must have been meant to be. Jeff our bartender took wonderful care of us. Great wine suggestions. He was supper attentive and helpful. We will be back at the bar to see Jeff."}
{"text":"This place never fails, we come here all the time. Love the staff, they are so nice and will help you make your decision. The pork chop is legit is to die for.. But so is everything else (chicken, ravioli, burgers, salmon.. Everything I've had) on the menu! Tuesday's burger and a bottle is an amazing deal! Bread pudding is must! Love it here!"}
{"text":"Went to Chops the local steakhouse that has opened recently.  The decor is tasteful and a blend between a traditional steakhouse with the wooden accents and decor and a modern flair with the open ceiling.  It is a small place and so can fill up pretty easily and was quite busy for a Sunday evening.  The service was attentive and in way saw too much of wait staff for such a small place.  Wine selection was decent.  The appetizers were very generic and seemed a bit overpriced so we never chose any.  We ordered the steak salad which was very ordinary.  Iceberg lettuce?  How about some Romaine as some of the more upscale steakhouses do?  Few pieces of steak.  We then ordered the Maui Rib Eye which had good flavor and the Chicken Piallard (fancy name but just a piece of flattend chicken breast with no flavor).  Very surprising that they did not have any hot bread served which is something that would add a nice touch to the meal.  All in all, a decent value if you go for one of their specials like Date Night on Thursdays?   Is it a dinner to remember... nah, but its does not disappoint either."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with a $30 for $60 Groupon.  I have to admit, my expectations were lowered after reading several of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First the décor.  It was nice, a little too dark for me, but overall I liked the feel of the place.  We sat in a high-back booth in the bar area that felt very private.  Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.  The service was also very good.  Our server, Shay, took great care of us.  She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.  Our food came out quickly and the billing process was also fast.  The food was good but not great.  They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.  First the ribs, tender, well seasoned, and a generous portion (5 or 6 bones).  The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy, especially for kids, so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.  My wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge, iceberg, blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50  My wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).  It was well seasoned and served with a loaded baked potato.  She ordered it medium but it came out closer to mid well-well done.  The meat was still flavorful and tender so we didn't send it back.  The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.  I got several of the appetizers for my entrée (potato fritters, beef carpacchio, and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good, basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay, needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing, 4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.  The place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.  I would go back to try some other items but probably order any meat a temperature less than I normally would."}
{"text":"We tried Chop for the first time and found the bad reviews quite perplexing.  We found the food to be quite well made and presented and the service to be quite attentive without being overbearing despite going on a busy Saturday evening.  We tried the pan seared ahi tuna, which was perfectly cooked, and came with a drizzle that added a surprising little zing.  I am not a tuna fan, but this was quite amazing.  Our meals were both served hot, and adequately presented.  The prime rib had good flavor without an overbearing rub (some places use way too much rosemary and garlic), and the lobster ravioli was quite light and delicious and not drowned in sauce.  It was a pricey meal, but worth it for a locally owned restaurant within close proximity to our home.  I want to add that they gave my wife her desert for free because it was her 50th birthday.  If I were to make a suggestion it would be to keep the lights up a little brighter, dark is intimate, but it was a tad too dark for my tastes. Lobster ravioli could be presented a little better without much effort from the kitchen.  We intend on going again."}
{"text":"I always Yelp for new places when I travel and while visiting relatives in nearby Mesa I decided to try CHoP on a Sunday night. While the reviews all indicated the restaurant was usually not overcrowded we were surprised to find only 3 other tables occupied after 8! Needless to say the service was great and we had the pick of the tables! I would like to return when there is a bit more atmosphere - but it was a Sunday night. Then it may move up to five stars when I can rate the service under normal conditions.  We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the main course - Barbecue Baby Back Ribs with a baked potato substituted for the fries for my companion. The ribs were well seasoned - just the right amount of sweetness to let the flavor of the ribs dominate and not too sticky. And he never had to pick them up as the meat came completely off the hot bones with just a fork - Excellent. And that baked potato was a hit. It was perfectly baked, not dried out and the added sour cream, bacon and a few chives really did the trick.  The other entrée was the Rubbed and Grilled Pork Tenderloin with a spicy mustard Barbecue sauce on the side. The presentation was unique with the tenderloin sliced and laid out in a line on an oval plate. Even so it stayed moist, warm and it was flavorful. The rub added to the taste and coupled with the sauce it was delicious. Another treat was the coleslaw on the side in a dish of its own. It was crisp and fresh with a mild bite to it. A great pairing.  We had two glasses of 14 Hands Cab - a favorite of mine - so nice to see it on the glass list.  I will be back on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Atmosphere was friendly, yet cozy and private at the same time.  I took my daughter there for her 13th birthday, and we both loved it."}
{"text":"This was our second time there and the customer service was once again EXCELLENT !  It doesn't matter who your server is, because their entire staff checks in on you during your dining experience.  We ordered the halibut and the prime rib which was served on the bone.  My green beans came out chewy and more al dente than I preferred, but they were quick to replace it with another side for me.... No questions asked ! Happy hour food menu selection was small, but they have great wine selections on HH. Keep in mind it's more of a meat or fish menu, so no pastas or a lot of veggie alternatives. Good portion size so you won't be left hungry."}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon with the intent of trying this restaurant out.  Made a reservation per the Groupon directions.   Upon arrival I was encouraged as the place was buzzing for a Monday evening.  We had to wait in the \"odd\" entrance area for the Hostess to seat another party, clear a table & intermittently greet other patrons upon arrival.  By the way the front door leads into an area about 10 x 10 where everyone (about 8-10 while we waited) waits to be greeted & seated. Once were seated not far from the front door/waiting area....it took a while for our server to greet us with water, etc.   Sadly our server was less than warm....in fact as the meal proceeded we only saw him after he took our orders, served the first glass of wine & poured the last of bottle.  I appreciate that perhaps he was giving us space/privacy but he appeared more attentive to other tables.   As for our meal, I ordered one of the specials, Ono with red pepper butter sauce.   This poor fish was overcooked & the presentation was poor for an establishment of this quality.  Thank goodness I chose a side of broccoli as it provided the only color to the plate though it was mushy.  My wife ordered the linguine with meatballs.  Satisfactory at best although the pasta was nicely al dente. I have to admit that I could have tracked down the server if I really tried...but quite frankly he seemed less interested in getting our business for the future.  I also didn't want to see another fillet of Ono destroyed by the kitchen!!   Groupon ' s are a marketing opportunity to bring in new patrons....this restaurant is definitely a pass for now & probably forever."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my husband last night. First off, the decor is beautiful, and the ambiance is fantastic. This is one of the coolest looking restaurants in the valley, and I have to admit we were surprised to see something so beautiful in a strip mall.   We were a little early for our reservation and had to wait at the bar before our table was ready, but even though it was really busy, the bar staff was very helpful and attentive. I ordered an Ocotillo Sunset which was like a martini with peach vodka and lime, and fruit juice. It was awesome. I ordered another one when we sat down, and I rarely do that.  I have to confess that artichokes are one of my all time favorite foods, and they have grilled artichokes as a special. Apparently, they aren't always on the menu, but they were last night, and they were amazing. They were perfectly grilled, and they came with a dipping sauce that was the perfect compliment. I figured that would be the highlight of the meal but I was wrong.  I ordered the sirloin steak with a baked potato, and my husband ordered the pork chop. Both were cooked exactly as we ordered them. Odd to focus on the side dishes, but my baked potato was huge, and I ended up finishing the whole thing because it was so good, and the cole slaw that came with my husbands pork chop was really good too. It was an asian style slaw and it was very light with just a hint of peanut flavor.  However, the highlight of the night for me was the dessert. We almost never order dessert when we go out, but I saw the peanut butter brownie on the menu and had to try it. First let me say that my husband ordered the creme brulee. It's his favorite dessert, and he really like the one from CHoP. It had a lemon flavor to it, and he said it was great. However, we both agreed that the peanut butter brownie was the better dessert by far.  All in all, fantastic meal. CHoP is a bit of drive from our house, but I'm sure we will be heading down there again. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Chop used to be a favorite. The steak frites--- awesome! Double chop, my husband's fave. We've introduced this restaurant to many people, but they've lost us.  On a Tuesday, we decided to head over for their special, 2 burgers and a bottle of wine for $30. Ordered our burgers and sides  and the server said sides are no longer included- the restaurant was losing money. If we wanted fries, it would cost $5.00 extra for a total of $10.00! WHAT!!!  Just the burgers, please, as I'm fuming. Burger shows up on a huge plate, looking very lonely, no lettuce, tomato-- nothing. Got home and did something I've never done-- researched the bottle of wine- I can get it for $7.00.  Really, a handful of fries would be to much to throw on the plate? Hate being nickle and dimed... We won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Chop for our Anniversary.  I had purchased a Groupon about 2 months ago and thought we could try it out.  I'm always worried how we will be treated when we tell the place that we are using a Groupon but in my opinion, it's a good way to try a place out.  Let me say this:  the food was wonderful.  Everything we ate was wonderful and had a lot of flavor.  The only bad thing about the food was that my husbands med-rare steak was over cooked, otherwise, we enjoyed everything else.    Service - in a nutshell, was horrid.  We ordered bottled water and 10 minutes later, she brought us two glasses of tap.  As we ordered, she was very curt, short and acted like she couldn't be bothered.  Wine came out when we were done with our appetizers.  She didn't bring anything to our table - besides the tap water.  As a matter of fact, the Chef came to our table to ask how everything was, and we said \"food is great\".  He bussed our table, also took our dessert order and dropped off our check.  We never saw her again.  Husband requested a glass of red to go with his steak, and barely got it before the last bite.  She was all over 2 other tables in her section, but ours and the table next to us - barely got a glance the whole night.    Atmosphere was swanky and fun.  It was loud and fun, but certainly not a place for a romantic evening, but that didn't matter, we enjoyed it.  Will we be back?  If they get better servers - certainly!  And we still tipped well because we didn't want to be those people who tip bad just because we had a Groupon.  Stupid us.  Bottom line, get better servers"}
{"text":"Vibe and food is on point. Great spot for a date with your spouse or significant other."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 6:15 tonight and still wasn't seated at 7:00 so our party of 4 left.  I have no idea how good the food is, but the management is subpar.  No one seemed concerned we had to wait or even attempted to apologize for the wait.  They didn't seem to have enough waiters and people to bus the tables.  There are too many fine restaurants in the area to put up with this level of service."}
{"text":"The service is impeccable, the bar has great ambience, and your wish is there command."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Ocotillo a few months ago and have finally came into Chop for the first time tonight for Christmas Eve dinner. We brought our extended family, and had made reservations. There was a mix up in our reservation- but within minutes they had a table ready for us! We really appreciate all they did to accommodate us on such a busy night!   The whole staff was so friendly and welcoming. Our server Matt was polite and attentive. The food was outstanding! A few of us had the pork chop (seriously the best chop I have ever had!), one had the salmon which was excellent. Two had the rib eye- which was incredible! I highly recommend the mushrooms.   Dessert was also noteworthy: toffee bread pudding, Oreo cookie pie and the key lime were all excellent!   The GM, Burnie, checked in on us a few times- such a great guy! We appreciate the hospitality and really felt welcomed to the neighborhood. Chop will absolutely become a regular stop for us!  Happy holidays to the whole staff and thank you again for a special evening."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Every time my family orders multiple steaks, they can never seem to get our temperatures correct. It is really unfortunate because we like the location and atmosphere. The ribs however are ALWAYS excellent.. but unfortunately this is a steak house and that is the one menu item they can't seem to perfect. :["}
{"text":"My husband and I love CHoP.  We eat out 4-5 times a week due to our work schedules.  We found Chop to be our favorite restaurant in South Chandler... Why???  The food is excellent and reasonably priced.  The service is superior.  The management team of Chris and Jill always ensure you have a great experience.  I would highly recommend Chop to anyone who hasn't tried them."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was not, but even worse was the manager's response.   Our service concerns: -We were seated on wet seats that had just been wiped down with a wet cloth.   -Our cocktails (ordered as straight up) were delivered on the rocks. -Salads were delivered, but we had no flatware or napkins, a manager brought us flatware, but no napkins. -The wine was set on our table unopened and the waitress walked away.  A manager finally noticed and opened our wine so that we could begin our meal. -Other than the initial pour, nobody ever returned to refill our wine. -One time (at our request) our waters were refilled, but not again. -Our plates were cleared only as we were leaving.   As our bill was delivered I asked for the manager and I informed her of our concerns.  She half-heartedly apologized and informed us this was not the service they pride themselves on, and that she had scolded the server. She had nothing to offer other than her apology.  The mistakes made were far beyond any one individual, and minor concerns were actually exacerbated by the manager's response.  It's rare when acknowledged and legitimate service concerns are made worse when the manager steps in."}
{"text":"I just celebrated the end of my 30+ year career as an airline pilot at Chop. We had 200+ family, pilots, flight attendants and friends there and the Chop staff was awesome along with the food and atmosphere! It was a perfect evening! For your next night out or your next party I highly recommend Chop and the staff...Jill, Burnie, Monica, Jeff, Nick, Matt and all the others! Love you guys! ?"}
{"text":"We went to the new place in Chandler, related to the other two in the Ocotillo shopping center, and the bar was full on a Wednesday Nite (January 30, 2013) with patrons having a great time.  We were seated in the bar area, as a group had reserved the large meeting room to the right as you come in the doors.  We have nothing but praise for the place.  The Happy Hour prices on wines, the appetizer (grilled artichokes) and the service was great.  $5 for a glass of great Cab?  Are you kidding me?  It was great.  We had two glasses over the course of the evening.  We had the petite fillet, (the baked potato for $5 was larger than the fillet) and both were excellent.  Done to perfection.  The wedge salad and the trimmings were cold, and tasty.  The FRESH IDAHO TROUT ((yes I need to shout out that dish) was wonderful, tasty, grilled to perfection, and no bones...All in all a great place, lively, a full  crowd but not rowdy...Yes, it was a little pricey, but not any more than I would have expected for a great steakhouse.  It will be a place to go to, any time, but hurry, as it fills up early...Here is to a great opening and a long tenure here in Chandler.."}
{"text":"Best Moscow Mule I've ever had - for the second time - and the wedge salad is always a great start to any of the menu items.  Manager, Jill, is delightful, knows her guests and keeps things humming while making your visit special.  The baseball cut sirloin is a winner with your choice of sides (all are good to great).  Would love to see some big bold red Washington wines (Va Piano Vineyards, Page Cellars, Amavi or Pepperbridge) on their list but otherwise five stars...always."}
{"text":"What a confusing experience.  This restaurant doesn't seem to know what it wants to be or what kind of clientele to expect.  If I could give this place a 2.5 I would.  My husband and I went here Friday night for an early Valentine's Day dinner to avoid the forced prix fixe madness across the Valley that is Valentine's Day.  We had a 7:15 reservation and got there a little early since we didn't know where it was and we weren't seated until 7:30.  We weren't the only ones waiting and our options were outside or in the bar area - which takes up a large portion of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself looks nice - dim lights, modern yet cozy setting - but your first impression of the restaurant as you stand there waiting for a table is the large, loud bar area with two bright televisions playing sports.  We were finally seated in a two-top and it was so close to the bar area it was hard to hear each other talk.  Our waitress was very friendly, although it was hard to tell her apart from the hostesses - they were dressed almost exactly alike.  This was something apparently appreciated by other male customers at the bar - I noticed at one point our waitress and one of the hostesses were paying an abnormal amount of attention to the men than their job.  I will say the food was delicious - I had the filet with cauliflower gratin and my husband had the beef short ribs.  Our issue was that we had barely received our drinks when the food came. While expediency is appreciated, I'm out to have a nice enjoyable evening and not feel like the restaurant is trying to shove my ass out the door.    So, CHoP - what are you, a sports bar or a steakhouse?  A place where people come to enjoy their meal and enjoy an accompanying glass of wine, or just another Outback where you're trying to turn tables as quickly as possible?"}
{"text":"Disappointed....after reading the reviews we thought we would give this place a shot to discount the less than average reviews and I cant help to say I  not impressed not only for how the food was prepared but also the prices. Our orders were very simple and my wife ordered a basic salad with chicken and I the prime rib (medium) with a \"baked \"potato. My wife received her salad with shrimp and I received the $30 prime rib with a bone and plenty of fat throughout the entire cut of meat. Its was chewy and not a very easy piece of meat to cut. Medium came out like rare just like the \" microwave baked\" potato. The potato temp had no chance of melting the toppings. Never used a knife before to carve a potato. Im not the kind of person who will send it back because I know whats coming on the return. I accepted the horrible meal because I did not want to disappoint the guests at our table. How does a salad come to the table with shrimp and not chicken. Whos managing the kitchen..this isn't a new review on food temp and prep..look down further folks..same meal same results. Oh by the way when the water glass sits empty that would mean fill it up but when you don't come by the table to check on your customers you certainly aren't going to do a good job to make sure your orders are prepared either. Theres plenty of steak houses in the valley for these prices,,,,don't be fooled. Im a well defined cook and just like the TV show...this place was named for those who aren't successful..CHOPPED."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. My boyfriend and I along with another couple tried this place out for the first time. I loved the inside, quite, dark, and quaint. The service and food were pretty good., but the price verses food ratio is off. I ordered the lobster ravioli and got five ravioli for 25 dollars. My boyfriend ordered the scallops which he got five scallops for 36 dollars. No salad, soup or side comes with these. So, for us, it wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"OMG, the mesquite artichoke is amazing!!!!! We have yet to order food that we haven't loved. So good."}
{"text":"Bartender was great and service was not terrible! The steak came over cooked and my husband and I both felt the bill seemed tacky and the waitress response was a tad more tacky! Bottom line, would go again but don't expect an apology if you meal is overcooked or a credit."}
{"text":"The steak was good but way over priced. Could have gotten the same steak at Outback for $15.00. The 4-course meal they have for $40.00 seems well worth the price. I would not order off their regular menu again--based on prices."}
{"text":"always busy, popular among those that are choosey. Spot on service/apps/entree's. Pricey, but everyone is that has anything that resembles \"competent\" service.  For the price you can do better, but the drive isn't worth it with this place right here.  I'll be back, no complaints"}
{"text":"Made our first visit to Chop last weekend and really enjoyed our experience. I can't believe we hadn't heard of this before! Great ambiance, service was awesome (every employee we encountered seemed happy and welcoming), and the food was even better! Being a ribs guy, guess what I ordered? Their baby backs...and it was delicious! I'm not a huge steak fan, but the filet mignon was amazing too. We had reservations (Sat night) to be on the safe side and when we left after 6 it was already filling up pretty quick. I hate listing downsides, but the menu seemed like it was a taaad bit pricey. No other complaints though. I like."}
{"text":"This was definitely a disappointment and we will not be back.  The steak was good but that was about it.  The restaurant was on the dirty side, dark and slow on the service not to mention our server left for the night without telling us.   The concept of the restaurant is good they just didn't pull it off well."}
{"text":"We tried CHoP last weekend. We went in with the intention to sit at the bar, order a couple glasses of wine (or more), have an app, salad and an entree. (woo date night!)  When we walked in, we were immediately impressed with the decor/ambiance. It was  a nice (upscale) change from the typical places in the Chandler area.   We found a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine while we perused the menu. Try to stay 'healthy' we decided on chicken satay, a salad and the pork chops.   The wine was delicious, and the wine menu was impressive.  Then the chicken satay came out......  I took the first bite and tried to figure out if I really liked the over-seasoned taste, or if it was 'too much' - at the same time I realized that something was just 'off.'  My husband took a bite and said \"uh, this is undercooked.\"   He cut the chicken down the middle to separate it from the skewer. The chicken was RAW! not just pink. RAW. If you have been to CHoP then you know it is really dark in there. The chicken was SO raw that you could even see it in the dark.  I immediately spit out my second bite that i had taken in the meantime. The bar waitress notices, asks us if there is an issue, to which we reply \"ya, this is raw.\"   She looked concerned, but not mortified like we were that we just ate raw chicken.   She asked if we wanted to order a different appetizer. Confused as to what just happened, we both said \"sure.\" But as we looked at the menu (remembering that we ordered pork for the  entree....and raw pork is pretty bad, too), we decided to cancel our order and go to Sauce.   In the mean time, when our bartender heard what happened, she came over and said \"well, the good news is that as long as it reached a certain temperature, it shouldn't do any harm.\" (ummmm....huh?). My husband replied \"if it was raw, then it didn't reach a certain temperature, trust me.\"   So - they comp'd our drinks (which was nice). But I was a little put off that the manager/owner didn't want to talk to us. Maybe we left too soon?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time on Thursdays \"Date Night\" where you get a four-course meal for $39.00. That means both appetizers and dessert are FREE. The best part of the meal hands down was the artichoke appetizer. It was absolutely delicious! We also shared the wedge salad-a classic. For entrees we shared the skirt steak and chicken palliard. I was really pleased to find out they serve all local meat, and the entrees were good (I liked the chicken entree better as I found the steak very boring and bland). For dessert we shared the pecan torte...pretty good. We would definitely go back for date night."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with \"Chop.\"  My friend and I saw the deal on Groupon and had been looking to find a decent steakhouse in the Chandler-Gilbert area, so Chop looked really promising. And it does *look* very nice.  The area is well maintained, the entrance is great, and the restaurant has a very upscale look.  When we were seated, the \"dirty laundry\" smell of the linen napkins was overwhelmingly strong and one of the two plates we were given was dirty.  The waitress seemed rather uninterested in us and my friend commented that we wished we had the waiter from a nearby table who seemed much friendlier and more animated.  We ordered the spinach dip and wedge salads but could barely eat the dip. It tasted like frozen spinach microwaved. The wedge salad was decent.  We both ordered the ribeye - mine rare, his medium rare. Mine came out medium well, his medium. When the waitress brought them she awkwardly demanded we cut into them in front of her. When I said they were overcooked she seemed uninterested.   We won't be returning and felt a little cheated by the extremely overpriced Applebee's quality food here."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant on a recent Friday night arriving around 5:00 p.m.  Walking in, I first noticed the decor, which is beautiful.  Next I noticed the very large bar-front and center- with only a handful of people for happy hour.  I was there to eat dinner and my party were the only diners (leaving around an hour later, there were two other diners and still a handful of people at the bar).    A very friendly waitress had both the bar and the restaurant diners to wait on. She couldn't see the restaurant diners from the bar because of how the restaurant is designed.    I had planned on a big meal, as I  hadn't eaten all day.  I ordered the fries from the happy hour menu and a salad, telling the waitress I would order the rest of my meal once I had decided, but to bring the fries with my meal.  I also ordered an iced tea.    My iced tea was immediately brought to the table.  One sip told me it was instant and not brewed---at a restaurant that wants $30-$40 for dinner.  I flagged my waitress down and she explained the tea came from the \"gun\" at the bar and was instant.  I asked for a coke (the water was not filtered, so I passed on that). The Coke came totally flat.  My waitress, a Coke fan, said she would taste it and they would fix the problem.  She came back with a new Coke, agreeing that the other was totally flat.  This time, there was a lot of fizz, but absolutely nothing that tasted like Coke.  Again, my waitress agreed.    Next the fries came out (rather than later as I had asked).  They were lukewarm to cold.  I sent them back.  They came back out very hot and were good.  But not the timing I asked for.   Next came my salad.  The menu stated it was a mix of lettuces with some iceberg.  My salad was 3/4 iceberg--- and worse the very crunchy middle that was virtually white.  I took a bite and the salad was warm.  Not even room temperature, but very oddly warm.  It was a weird experience to eat warm lettuce.  I flagged down my waitress and she came back and explained that the kitchen was very, very small.  The cooks had very little room to set dishes to be served, so they set it on the oven.  She offered to bring another salad out.  This one was chilled, but still mostly iceberg lettuce (with very, very few other ingredients.)   My dining companion was having other problems.  We decided to leave rather than order the rest of our meal."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly a wonderful fish restaurant, even though it is called Chop. The Idaho Trout is amazing and the sides are terrific, onion rings, spaghetti squash and cauliflower gratin. We can't wait for the excellent pecan pie. All so good!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great happy hour. I'd recommend the ribs. Oh, and great staff too . I only go once a month but look forward to it every time."}
{"text":"We always like eating at Chop Chandler and enjoy taking friends along with us.  The service is very good with friendly and attentive staff.  The food is prepared to liking and always very good.  It can be a bit noisy and hard to hear the people you are with."}
{"text":"Groupon night at a new place.  The OK - The food average. -Artichoke dip was tasty -I had the Maui Ribye (I really liked) -My wife had the Filet whch was just ok. -The brocolli that was included with both meals was dreadful. -The side of mushrooms was pretty good.  The Bad - It's too dark.  Our eyes took several minutes to adjust after entering the building. - The service was the same I get at my \"Nieghborhood bar and grill\" maybe worse.   For example: Usually I would be delighted to be asked if I wanted something to drink three times, but when my server takes my drink order and then comes back and asks me again if I would something to drink five minutes later, I just feel awkward.  Then after finishing said drink my server made three trips to my table before realizing my glass was empty and offering me another.  Granted I could have told him I needed another one but he seemed like he was in a rush to do something else and I couldn't get the words out before he was gone again.  This lack of consideration continued throughout the meal.. - I made reservations and feel like I was givin the worst seat in the place  We were seated right next to the kitchen door and bar ordering station.  So much staff action here it's strange they were not more attentive to us.  And since i mentioned this was our very fist time visiting this establishment when making the reservation, I expected something better I guess. - Also,  as the host was seating us; both my wife and I took a step toward our seats when we where suddenly cut off by one of the staff members rushing by in front of us.  Not even an \"excuse me\" or \"sorry\" as he passed.  As if we were in his way!  Overall It was the service that killed the experience for us.  The atmosphere and prices suggest/demand a trained, professional and informed staff.  Once this gets fixed I might come back and try again.  But with so many other options available I don't feel like Chop Chandler made a good first impression and it will be a long time before I give them another chance."}
{"text":"We love coming to Chop! The food is great, we love the meat balls and Mac and cheese for happy hour. For dinner you can't beat the rib eye. Best part is the servers, Lauren and Jeff. They are very attentive & personable. The restaurant is adult oriented and we haven't found anything better in the East Valley. Kudos to Bernie and the whole crew for an A+ experience every time."}
{"text":"A brief one visit review:   Pros: -Super smart, accommodating hostess -Great interior, very classy very modern - Great value if you hit one of their \"deal nights\" that appeals to your party - The food is good and some of it is very creative   Not so good: - Rudest Bartender in the valley, yes she is attractive, but... - Really sub par service dominated by the hipster elite - not very kid friendly, but the hostess did try hard to make it so  I would go back on a date night."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon so I am one of those that is generally cheap.  But I've been to plenty of nice restaurants and when they are good then I walk away feeling the money was well spent.  With Chop, I felt that even with the Groupon I paid too much.  It started with the chicken satay appetizer....most people at the restaurant were in groups of 2 or 4 so why would the appetizer come with 3 pieces?  Gave me a glimpse of the lack of thought of the restaurant.    I just can't see myself coming back for more.  There are plenty of other restaurants that are better.    Pros: nice atmosphere and waiting.  Music was nice.    Cons:  food was quite expensive and only a 2 star for taste.  We had a grilled salmon plate and also a steak salad.  Neither was bad but they weren't worth the $20 each, maybe $12."}
{"text":"I will say we were seated quickly and the service was always prompt but you don't go to a restaurant especially a dark dark restaurant just for quick seating and wonderful service. You go for the food and to a lesser extent the value of that food by what you pay. And this restaurant failed miserably. Although I had a Groupon discount the meal was anti-climatic. We were served fish cakes instead of crab cakes that were massively overpriced. Then when we ordered our main entree which both of us had the 16 oz New York steak we didn't expect that both $38 steaks would come charcoal black on the outside and nearly Raw on the inside with almost more Grizzle than meat!  With cold broccoli parmesan and cauliflower  gratin that was nearly up to par we finished the meal with our heads hanging low. If it wasn't for the Groupon discount this below average meal would have been nearly $150. Now I have to give props to McKenna our server. She was friendly, confident and always doing what she can to help us, but unfortunately due to time constraints we couldn't wait for our food to be redone so we had to hurry up and go to the Chris Tucker concert. Would I ever go there again? Not in this lifetime and I hope they read this and change their meat supplier and kitchen staff. Very sub-par very much so. So if you're looking for a much finer cut of meat for the money my suggestion would be to go to McDonald's"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent!  My fiancé and my first time there. Started with spicy fried calamari! It was cooked perfectly! Yum.   We both had the fish if the day. I had sword fish with squash. Let me tell you. The fish was great!  My fiancé has the bass with grill corn. Not cute watching him attack this poor defenseless corn but all it was very tasty!  The service was great! No complaints."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend who lives in Chandler. .Beautiful restaurant...female bartenders all nice..we ordered the rib eye steak rare but hot in the middle. It arrived cold in the center ..let's just say raw..when asked the manager to take it back and off the bill..as we wanted to try another specialty of there's. .he argued well when you order it as raw as can be.. that's what the chefs cook???? I said rare but cooked..We ordered the chop at the chop  house..the Manger delivered the plate to us by literally dropping on the bar and sliding it towards my girlfriend...horrible experience...mind you.. we had already had chicken satay and deep fried pickles that were fabulous..we are not difficult people. The chop was tough. .I do not recommend this  restaurant for upscale dining...there sister The Living Room always fabulous. ."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this restaurant but was lucky enough to win a Bride's Day Out from the Bridal Expo.  Chop was the last restaurant we had a tasting at and I wish I wasn't more full.  I did try everything and it was amazing.  Sometimes even when the food is great, if the service is bad, it can ruin the meal.  This is not the case with Chop.  The service was amazing and genuine.  I love their private dining experience (it's hard to find that outside of Scottsdale).  I really appreciate the bartender Blake.  He was very knowledgable and definitely increased my knowledge of wine and what I like."}
{"text":"The short version?  The highpoint of the meal was a baked potato.  The longer version is this.  I'm perfectly happy to pay $175 for dinner (with tip).  But (and this is going to sound weird), said meal should be worth it.  Crazy talk, I know.  First, the good: it's a very attractive space.  Ambience get's an A-.  The hostess was very nice and courteous - same for our waitress.  Both get an A.  That, however, is where the good news ends.  We had a couple cocktails to begin - my girlfriend had a vodka/berry/something-or-other chick drink.  She seemed reasonably happy with it.  I had a Moscow Mule.  I'm fairly confident there was some vodka in it but I can't be sure.  It was a very weak pour.  I'm not suggesting that it should be fraternity-guy-strong.  But it felt like the bartender was using one of those automatic liquor disperser thingies that precisely measures exactly 1 oz shots - not a drop more.  Very corporate-esque.   That sort of thing is fine in a chain restaurant. Certainly not at a place with this price point.    On to the wine list; it was decent if somewhat short.  Ended up ordering a Chateau St. Michelle cab - decent wine, decent price.  It was even cellar temperature so thumbs up on that one.    To the food then.  To begin, we split a grilled artichoke for an appetizer - generously sized portion, well prepared, and well presented.  A-.  Why \"minus\"?  The aoli tasted like it came from a jar.      Then the entrees.  Ugh.   Where do I begin?  Well, my girlfriend had their Chicken Paillard.  I'm all for restaurants interpreting recipes in their own way.  But this was more like arugula salad that happened to have some chicken buried underneath.  The only similarity to Chicken Paillard it had was the name.  When I asked her how it was, she said \"It's food.\"  This, by the way, is our code for: its edible but not something I ever want to eat again.  C+ at best.    Then my entrée.  I had the bone-in, New York Strip with a side of sautéed mushrooms.  $38.   When you charge that for a steak, you place yourself squarely in the crosshairs of the big boys: Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Smith & Wollensky's, et cetera.  So you better have your sh*t together.  In this case, Chop brought a (very small) knife to a gun fight.  I'm not going to say it was the worst steak I've ever had.  But it was every bit the worst $38 steak I've ever had.  Even though it was cooked perfectly, it was tough.  Really tough.  As in \"Are you f*cking kidding me?\" tough.  I looked but didn't see any marks from where the jockey was hitting it.  But it was dark in there so who knows.  To add insult to injury: the mushrooms were cold and had waaaaayyyyy too much vinegar on them (psst: they're not pickles guys).  Kind of a final middle finger from Chop to us.  D-  And that's being generous.    The bright silver lining here was the baked potato.  Yep, that was the highlight of the meal.  We actually ended up having a good natured argument as to who got to eat it since we had both abandoned our entrees very early on.    So again: the staff did their job.  But the owners are cheaping-out where it counts: on the ingredients (except for the potato: that was kick ass).   My take: if you want this caliber dining, go to Applebees or any of the other faceless, soulless corporate places out there and save yourself $125.  Because this is \"food\", no more and no less."}
{"text":"This is a new comment on my review of 8-6.  The manager reached out to me & offered a gift card to make it right.  I appreciate his offer, it was a busy & hectic evening & I'm sure it wasn't intentional.  I didn't notice till later when I checked the bill & maybe overreacted.  We have been there several times & have always enjoyed the food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"We bring customers here regularly, and it's a hit. If hungry, you can't go wrong with the Pork Chop or ribs.  The filet is very tender and juicy. It's a darker but nice atmosphere; perfect for date night.  The staff is always professional, friendly, and on top of things. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wants to be high end, but falls short.  This was our third visit to Chop since they opened. I had a Groupon. I really, really wanted to like Chop. Our first two visits were also mediocre. We thought we'd give it one last try. On the positive side, food is pretty outstanding. Their 2 inch pork chop is to die for. The calamari appetizer was excellent. And that's about it for positives. Our server, while friendly, was very young, never introduced herself, and couldn't answer a few simple wine questions. When she told us about the specials, she said \"we have halibut and swordfish\".??? A description would be nice. Aren't servers supposed to \"sell\" the specials by making them sound delicious? For a restaurant that prides itself on wine, the staff needs more training. Water glasses weren't refilled. We had to ask two separate times. Dirty appetizer plates sat on the table throughout the meal. We weren't given fresh silverware for our entrees. No manager ever came around to check on tables - that's a real no-no. And it's very noisy. We had a corner table (upon request) and still got lots of noise from the bar. The wine list was adequate but not outstanding. No interesting dessert choices. For a place where steaks are in the almost $40 range (pork chop is $24.50) and you have to order your sides in most cases, it's just not worth the high price you pay. Go a little further down Dobson to Ocotillo, go left almost to Alma School and eat at Dvine Bistro and Wine Bar. Superbly trained staff, outstanding food, and an amazing wine list. And yes, the staff is trained to answer any and all questions about the wine list. All for around the same price as Chop. Main suggestion to Chop: train and educate the staff on your products, and ensure that they are professionals. In this price range, it's to be expected."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Chop since it opened. There have been a few changes recently, but Christine behind the bar was delightful and one of the main reasons we continue to visit. The GM seems to be rather unfriendly and a bit chaotic. We hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Maybe I have watched too many episodes of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmare but I can say I finally found a restaurant that desperately to evaluate the dishes they are serving their clients.    Appetizer: Crabcakes ($14) Verdict: Don't waste your time. For $14, you are better off getting frozen ones from the frozen food aisle at Walmart. The only thing that was acceptable was the asian slaw that came with it.  Entree 1: Cheeseburger ($9.95) + egg ($2) Verdict: Ordered medium rare but got medium. On top of that, the middle was a little cold. Makes me think the burger was thrown onto the grill before it has fully thawed. Should have picked up some meat from AJ's and made my own burger. Btw, they have a sale on their beef. My wife was not happy.   Entree 2: Steakhouse Linguine with meatballs in vodka sauce ($16) Verdict: If I wanted tasteless dry meatballs, I'd make some. Making meatballs are not really my forte but eating them is. The vodka sauce was so watered down that I barely knew it was there.   Side: Sweet potato fries ($6) Verdict: Finally, the pièce de résistance of the entire meal. By some act of God, they did not screw the fries up. It was pretty tasty. This is the reason for the extra star. Oh yeah....and the beer. They didn't have to make that one.   Overall, the atmosphere and the wait staff were four stars but the food definitely needs work. I feel that a restaurant should put in equal among of effort into every dish on the menu. If you put it on your menu, you better make sure it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Although Chops is a steakhouse, their menu is varied enough to suit any palate.  As I am more vegetarian inclined, I ordered the portobello burger with sweet potato fries.  It was very good. I ordered it without the bun and that didn't seem to be an issue.  The BF had the same thing I ate and his comment was \"it tasted a lot better than it looked.\"  The place was quite busy but the service was still very good.  Nice location and it has to compete with a few other restaurants in the complex but it certainly can hold its own."}
{"text":"Absolutely first class customer service! Food was amazing. Waitress was training and she didn't miss a beat. Would recommend to anyone trying to have a great meal with a mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had anniversary reservations via Open Table with my wife for May 29th. Arrived and hostess says there are no tables available and that there will be a lengthy wait. So much for \"reservations\". As we stood there, another party with no reservation was seated ahead of us. The hostess also informs us that Chop Chandler routinely overbooks. Very disappointed that Chop Chandler does not honor their Open Table commitments. We left without eating. The teenage hostesses were extremely rude with a \"too bad for you\" attitude. If you're an adult, I would recommend taking your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food wasn't worth what you paid for. Don't get hamburgers at all. It was extremely over cooked and very small for a $10 burger. Onion rings were mediocre and the ranch is disgusting. If you like dill ranch you may like it. Steak was decent. I ended up eating my kids macaroni and cheese since it was amazing. Service was mediocre as well. We started off with one person ended up with another (second lady not so friendly). Super dark inside and out. We had a groupon thank goodness because if we didn't I would be upset with $70 bill."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday dinner (with a groupon...).  The service was just fine - waitress brought the food promptly and checked on us as needed.  The food is a bit pricey (groupon helped), but everything tasted good, portion sizes were generous and the presentation was also a plus.   Overall, I can recommend this as a special occasion restaurant, or if you stick to the lower priced parts of the menu, a nice regular dinner.  They even gave us happy hour pricing on the drink and a comped dessert :)"}
{"text":"We had a large group of seven to celebrate a birthday.  The ambiance is nice, waitress and staff seemed nice and attentive. We ordered the following appetizers: calamari, chicken satay, artichoke spinach dip all were tasting and excellent.  The main courses we had were center cut fillet, new strip and ribs everyone enjoyed the food and commented how tender and tasty everything was, this was a very enjoyable dinner.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars (steak, sides, desserts, salads all good). The soup was gross and they forgot to take it off the bill at first. Also this is the only steakhouse I've ever been to with such a short wine list!  Service was awful! We had a waitress that would walk into the room, fill one glass of water then go to the kitchen to grab one fork, etc. She could not multitask so everything took Sooo long! We were there for 2.5 hours for dinner. She also knew nothing about properly opening and serving a bottle of wine.  Overall pretty good. Just don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place:  we were meeting old friends we hadn't seen in years, it was my husband's birthday, and we traveled 40 minutes to eat here.  So, we tried to pass off the negative reviews as sour grapes and went in with a hopeful attitude.  What I gathered by the end of the evening is that Chop seems to want to find a magical combination of special-occasion restaurant and affordable (read, busy) hangout, yet succeeds at neither.  From the get-go, we experienced disorganization and lack of training (both of which are essential ingredients of those \"quality\" steakhouses), and the food did not measure up to its not-exactly-affordable prices.        The first question mark came when I called for reservations.  I got a voice on an answering machine, which asked for all the pertinent details, but then said \"If we CAN'T fit you in, we'll call you back.\"  (???)   Luckily we had no issues there.  The place wasn't too crowded, even though it was a Saturday (hmmm...).  When we arrived, we wondered, as other reviewers did, why there was no host station in the front.  There were, however, at least three hostesses or servers near the entrance as we arrived, most of them chatting with the large group in front of us.  One young woman greeted us with a \"hi!\" but made no move to seat us or give further instruction.   (What happened to the standard \"Welcome to___!  Can I help you?\")  Luckily, the rest of our party was already seated and we saw them easily (it's a small place).          After drinks, we had our first real setback.  We ordered two servings of the grilled artichoke appetizers, which were horrible--blackened/burnt on the outside, with the heart scooped out of the inside (probably to make the spinach artichoke dip).  Worse, the 'chokes were the size of a child's fist.  We picked a few of the halves apart and attempted to eat some of it,  but found only a few edible bites at best-- definitely not worth $9.50.  When we told the waitress politely that we were dissatisfied, she looked like a deer in the headlights.   She had a pleasant, breezy attitude, but it was as if she wasn't trained, or didn't want to respond to anything beyond \"everything's great.\"  No offer to reorder the food, replace it with a different appetizer, or take it off the bill.  (Any one of these Standard Operating Procedures would have been fine, but alas, we only got a stare and a smile.)   We also ordered bread, which took over ten minutes to arrive.  When we reminded her about it after our food was served, she told us a little curtly that it \"has to be prepared.\" Turns out the bread (only four pieces for six of us??)  was also grilled, and the charred stripes were bitter and unpleasant-tasting.  (Note to management:  a good bread basket would be easier on your staff, and more pleasing to your patrons.)          The main courses were decent overall, but not outstanding.  The menu is tame and nothing says, \"wow, I want to try that!\" or \"I come here for the ____; can't get that anywhere else.\"  Three of us had the baseball sirloins, which were cooked well but on the chewy side, on par with Outback's cheaper cuts..  The loaded baked potatoes, however, were gigantic and filling.  Our friend's salmon was moist, but my husband's chicken paillard was overcooked and quite dry, which is his pet peeve.  However, by this time the waitress made only very brief appearances, and he felt it wasn't worth the effort to send it back.  When she brought dessert menus, three of us told her that it was my husband's birthday, yet again, it was deer-in-the-headlights, and no offer of a free dessert  (???).  Still, two of us decided to try the key lime pie (on special) and the lemon crème brulee.  The pie had a great crust and was the best part of the meal, which cheered us up slightly.  The brulee was okay, but served warm (I'm used to it being chilled, but that's me).          As others here have pointed out, there are many great steakhouses in town, and if Chop wants to play with the big boys, they need to take some cues from Maestro's and Donovan's (still the best in the Valley imho, but a fair drive from Chandler).  First, EVERYTHING that comes out of the kitchen needs to be perfectly prepared:  nothing overcooked, ever!  Also, consider more innovative dishes.  Next, service must also be trained to pick up on and meet customer's needs.  This includes having a streamlined seating procedure.  C'mon!  They've been open for more than a year, these kinks really should have been worked out by now.  I have to agree with the poster who doubted the restaurant would survive a year.  There's just too many good restaurants to choose from in this town to settle for a mediocre meal and poor service, with a $270.00 tab (that's with a Groupon deal).    So I have to wonder if the glowing reviews here weren't written by employees or their friends.  Chops gets a \"C\" grade at best, and all six people in our party agreed that it's not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"This was a special birthday dinner for me, so maybe my expectations were too high,  but we were a little disappointed in the service. The server was a sweet gal, but when we were seated and asked about the wines her response was that she was only 19 and didn't know about wine, but could get the manager. After that we waited what seemed like a very long time for unspectacular bread, or repours of our overpriced wine. It was all doubly unfortunate because I ordered the prime rib and 20 minutes -- 20 minutes! later was told they were out.  The birthday bread pudding was fantastic, and that and our groupon to ease the hefty bill saved the experience, but we will probably look elsewhere for steak options next time."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! - Unless you have a groupon - I think - The staff is friendly and conversational - its not their fault the food stinks - if you want to spend quality money on quality food head to your traditional steakhouses - this place is no better that a busy Friday night with over cooked food at Texas Roadhouse or Chillis - the steak was overcooked and broccoli was frozen - my wife's burger was no better than your average Chillis burger - kids meal was the only decent sized plate - mac and cheese was good and the fries were the best of the entire meal - considering that I went to a steakhouse and best I can say is the fires were awesome?!? - so if you want a pretentious joint that's laced with the loafer, short shorts, Tommy Bahama shirt wearing, pinky in the air, oversized wine glass I rule the world 5 carat wedding ring company then this is your place otherwise don't even waste your time with the GROUPON - NOTE TO SELF HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A GROUPON TO RUTH'S CRIS - AVOID THIS DUMP - GO TO FLEMINGS !!"}
{"text":"Very nice steak. They got the medium rare perfectly. Very accommodating on changes when I didn't want certain things. The place is also very pleasant, the atmosphere is nice. Super slow to bring the food, though. I didn't care for the \"pecan torte\" (otherwise known as pecan pie lol) - nothing special."}
{"text":"We had the best meal and server (Matt) Thursday night.  We have been going to Chop for years but usually have bad servers and an okay meal.  So we stay away for 6 months or longer.   I don't know what management did but the ribs were the very best.  The 7 Falls Cabernet was delicious.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Sorry, just not feeling it. The service was the worst part.  If your going to charge the prices you do you must pay attention to your customer and their needs. The 6 pieces of lobster ravioli that my husband got for his birthday was not even cooked correctly, $24 never again."}
{"text":"I get a little suspicious every time I see a really good or a really bad review of somebody who happens to have below FIVE reviews on Yelp in more than a year.   Come on, people, grow up. If you're competitors/haters, grow up. If you're BFF with the owner, don't comment or try to be as objective as you can. If you had a pretty bad experience but are not planning to be part of the Yelp community, send a letter to the manager/owner.  With Chop I kindly recommend to dismiss the nasty reviews and give the place a try.  I'm not affiliate to the place or the owners so I feel free to say what I think.  The ambiance and decor is great. The service was pretty good (Shanen I believe was the waitress name) and the food was above good.  I had the small filet, a 7 oz which seems more like a 9oz with a good side of broccoli with tasteful cheese. It was cook to perfection. My only complain would be the unnecessary scoop of butter (or some kind of rub alike) on the top.   The price was pretty decent in comparison with other steak houses.  Remember that it's a new place so they have to work in tuning things up but all in all, it's a great addition to Chandler and I'll definitely go back.  Maybe next time I'll sit a the bar to review that section of the place.  Cheers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a date night here last night and loved the ambience, from the lighting to the aroma of yummy food.  My husband was able to call ahead to make reservations and we were immediately seated after walking in for our 5:30pm reservation.    We had Chris for our waiter who was very nice.  I had asked about a merlot to try and after tasting I wanted a more \"smoky\" wine.  Chris was very nice but not very wine knowledgeable so I asked if he could ck with the bartender.  We were very impressed to have the bar tender come over to our table and personally talk with us.  They didn't offer a smoky flavored wine by the glass but offered a bottle.  I just wanted a single glass of wine so I chose to have a different drink.  He then asked if we were locals and what wine we were looking for.  I told him yes and a favorite red wine of mine is called \"Pazo\". He said he would add it to their lists of wine to order as they would be offering over 100 plus wines in the near future.  We ordered the spinach and chips appetizer and it was perfect portion as well as super fresh and delectably delightful starter to our meal.  We then had a house salad and a Cesar salad and enjoyed both, perfect portions and fresh, crisp lettuce and veggies.  My husband ordered pesto salmon with Brussels sprouts and it was melt in your mouth wonderful.    I ordered the filet and a baked potato that was extremely tender and had an aromatic flavoring with the maple butter flavoring.  We finished our enjoyable meal with a lemon creme brûlée and it was off the hook with a twist of lemon flavor.  We will definitely be back to Chop as it was a great experience with a fun, romantic atmosphere.  My husband made mention he loved the wall behind the bar.  The wall was floor to ceiling shelves with alcohol bottles and sheer lighting behind setting the perfect mood for a date night.  Enjoy, we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took my clients here last night on their recommendation. Chop did not disappoint. The wait staff was impeccable in their timing and amount of attention. The food was delicious. I had the trout and it was enjoyable but I found myself digging into my partner's baby back ribs. Wow, them ribs were simply amazing!!    Our cocktails were top class an our whole group ordered seconds. All in all a great time. Perfect place to entertain guest, date, etc.   BONUS: I made a mistake on the bill. It was my fault but the manager graciously and discreetly corrected it without any qualms. First class act."}
{"text":"Horrible Overall!  This place gets a 1 star for the decor only!  Went in on a Wednesday night, waited over an hour for a table, even though half the tables were empty.  Only stayed because it was my sons birthday and he really wanted to go there.  Food is average at best!  Service was bad, got our appetizer before our drinks.  Had to ask the server for refill on water multiple times throughout the meal.  Beware when you get the bill, they charge some extra taxes that aren't required, we made the manager remove it.  Save your money and go get a real steak at the keg by chandler mall"}
{"text":"Great start with our waiter. ( I don't know his name). Was very disappointed in service  from McKenna. Food was great. Service not so much!!"}
{"text":"The 2 star rating is for the \"bang for your buck.\"  I have no problem spending $100+ on dinner for two if the food is incredible. Came here with a groupon.  Ordered the Caesar salad, steak and salmon.  Everything was just OK. The steak lacked seasoning and didn't melt in your mouth. What is weird is Texas Roadhouse has steaks that are so flavorful and delicious. I was expecting more. Nothing stood out. I kept thinking to myself, if it were not for this Groupon and everything being half off I would have felt ripped off. lol Go to Fogo De Chao or Roadhouse if you want a good steak.  Don't waste your $ and expectations here."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of checking out the new joints in Chandler and thought hitting up CHoP was a perfect fit for my mom's b-day. Overall experience was pretty good and our night was saved by finally getting some good service towards the end of our meal..so refreshing after a rocky start to our evening. I worked in the service industry and I'm not asking for over the top service but it's nice when, I don't know, your server smiles and says hello..or I don't know..if the bartender acts interested in gaining your drink order? Overall the food was good & flavorful. I hit up the mixed grill special and it was delish - ribs, chicken & local sausage. Apps were tasty but as other reviewers have mentioned I don't know that the price point matches up for what you're getting on the plate. I'd check them out again...and cross my fingers that we get the same server that saved the experience!"}
{"text":"We went out to Chop last night for a nice dinner. We started with the Grilled Artichoke, it was good but very salty. She had the Ocotillo Sunset and it was delicious. She also had the Salmon Filet and it was great. I had the Maui Rib-eye. It was cooked well and the flavor was amazing. We had the Pecan Torte for desert and I was not impressed. It was overly sweet and did not have a good texture.   Overall the ombience was very nice, food was OK.  However, I would not go back without another Groupon. The food is a just too over priced."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Waited 30 min for table...no worries for Friday night and no reservations. Saw waited twice...asst manager stood in as \"waitress\". Ordered baby back ribs for a child and an adult, both plates came out cold. Really only saw waiter!!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time dining at Chop, both our previous experiences were quite good, but it's been around a year since our last dinner there. We were given a generous gift card to use. We arrived at 4 p.m. and were seated at a table near the bar, there were 2 patrons at the bar. The first thing we noticed was how loud the music was playing. We don't mind music, but we prefer to \"hear\" our dinner conversation. We asked if the music could be lowered in volume, it was lowered minutely, still to loud for a relaxing dinner or even conversation. My spouse ordered the pork chop with the brocolli parmesan side. We've ordered this dish in the past and it was always quite good. I ordered the short rib dinner which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Neither of our dinners were remotely close in quality to our previous dining experience. My spouses brocolli parmesan had an odd taste, some type of strange spices and the cheese was not parmesan, it was closer to a romano or pecorino. He sent it back and asked for the cauliflower o'gratin dish as a replacement. The pork chop was dry and tough, not tender and juicy like our previous dining. The cauliflower side arrived and it was practically inedible, they had not drained the cauliflower adequatly, and the cheese tasted like a powdered yellow cheese. The shortrib dish, which is $28 arrived with two small portions of ribs, very overcooked and stringy. For the price of these menu items, diners deserve better. There are too many better restaurants in the area to spend our dining dollars and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing first time visit. The food was good and the service was great. The wine list was small but all the selections were great. Wednesday is 1/3 off bottle night which is a good deal. The manager on duty was fantastic change of pace he was doing everything that was essential for the night to run smooth. Props to the management team."}
{"text":"At first we were hesitant in dining here due to our prior experience of the steaks being overlooked and on the saltier side(two to three years ago). We gave it go and were pleasantly surprised with the taste and service this time around.   Food - Fried Zuccini, Downtown field greens, garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, cauliflower gratin, broccoli , and Boneless Maui Rib Rye.   The highlights of the meal was the fried zuccini, garlic mashed potatoes, and the Maui rib eye steak. We loved that the zuccinis were sliced in chips versus spears and the cucumber ranch was a nice touch. The marinade on the steak was delicious and the meat was tender. On par with Houston's/Hillstone's Hawaiian rib eye.    Drinks - Blackberry Smash - if you like bourbons, this is a fabulous cocktail for you.   Service - Our server Jess was attentive, informative, friendly, and did not hover.   This will become our new local favorite steakhouse."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, very classy and nice for a date. The baseball top cut sirloin was amazing with the asian coleslaw. Match it with a Pinot Noir Mont Pellier,  you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night... we made reservations but arrived 30 minutes early to try out the bar.  The Happy Hour is really good (4 - 6).  Draft beers are only $2.50 and all 'You Call Its' were $5.  The wife enjoyed her wine and I had a Whiskey sour -- both were good.  The bar is nice for small gatherings and the bartenders were nice and knew their stuff.  We moved to our table and were seated in a very comfortable, quiet, dark table only lit by a candle and some dim lights around the trim.  We started with the wedge salad and it was great -- maybe a little too much dressing but it was fine by me and the ingredients were fresh and pungent.  For our entrees my wife had their signature dish 'The Chop' and she loved it (she replaced the cole slaw with grilled asparagus)... I don't think she put her fork/knife down once.  I ordered the Bone-In Strip (medium rare of course) at the waiters recommendation and it was extremely flavorful and full of juice.  The bone was gigantic and later given to the dogs.  There was nothing I didn't like about Chop, our tab did come out to ~$150 after tip but that was b/c we each had 3 drinks.  I would recommend this place (the bar) for a small gathering and dinner for a nice, romantic, somewhat reasonably priced steak house."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is always great and the food is delicious. I personally love to go on Sunday or Tuesday when it is burger night. Their burgers are amazing and you get two burgers and a bottle of wine for $29 between 4-6pm. They also have great salads, and a great happy hour. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have only eaten here once so can't attest to the food quality. But l, I tried to book a 20 person event at this location in their private room. I was not allowed to talk to a manager at the 4pm opening time. Was hung up on and no one ever returned my call. They obviously don't need the business that bad."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful birthday celebration here. Our family ordered the sirloin, filet, pork chop, prime rib, and lamb chops. Everything was cooked perfectly! My son's mac and cheese was by far the best side we tried. Our server was attentive with great timing... she didn't hover, but our glasses were never empty. Unfortunately, our budget won't let us come here more often, but for special occasions, Chop is our local favorite!"}
{"text":"Went for Anniversary dinner. There was a little Snafu w/our order. The Manager totality made it right. Relaxed environment with legit steaks. They can handle big groups or smaller ones. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"First time at CHOP and it did not disappoint.  Had two salads which contained a variety of greens, croutons and bacon in a champagne vinaigrette.  Very nice and they customized hubby's salad by omitting the bacon.  Do you know anyone who omits bacon on anything?  We ordered two baseball sirloins which came with a full-sized (and I mean full) loaded baked potato.  I didn't find the potatoes to be that loaded.  It had sour cream, butter, chives and bacon.  What I was missing was a little more bacon if you are going to call it loaded.  As usual, hubby asked for the potato to be naked--nothing on it.  Yes, plain.  He chose a plain potato over a loaded potato.  Do you sense  aberrant behavior here?  Is it time for the men and/or women in white coats to put him into a white van and take him to a place where the decor is mostly white (well, it used to be).  Now they add color for the benefit of the patients.  To go on, the sirloins were perfectly cooked as individually requested. Even hubby's blood rare steak came out blood rare.  Of course, he thought that it could have been rarer.  Not so.  But then again vampires are never satisfied.   The service was good mostly provided by well-groomed, attractive, really young ladies who did not miss a beat.   Water glasses filled and on their toes.  Thank you ladies.  By the time we left close to 8PM, the place was packed.  It seems I am not the only one who likes CHOP."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe, dim lighting, cool ambiance, and modern decor. Tip: leave the kids at home, this is more of a \"date night\" kind of place.   We didn't have reservations, but were able to be seated immediately on a Friday evening to our surprise. Our server promptly greeted us and informed us that she was brand new and not very knowledgeable about the menu just yet. That was fine by us, as long as she was attentive, which she was...to the best of her ability. The only thing that struck us as odd was how many different coworkers kept coming to our table to deliver food, drinks, refills, etc....obviously they were helping her out...a LOT. My husband ordered the filet (med-rare) and it came out PERFECT. I ordered the salmon, and while the edges were crispy, the inside was very undercooked, almost raw. I sent it back to the kitchen to be cooked some more and it came out a few minutes later done to perfection as well. The manager Chris came over to our table and addressed the issue immediately, told us he was taking 25% off our bill and comping a dessert (key lime pie=delicious!). Very nice gesture. We stayed a while to enjoy a few drinks, and never felt rushed at all.   Was our dining experience here perfect? No. Mistakes happen. It's how they're dealt with that makes all the difference. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I hate about restaurants its when you charge over $30 for a plate that isn't worth much more thatn $19. I do not understand how or why anyone could give this place 5 stars.   We typically head to Scottsdale or Phoenix for our date nights on the weekends but since we live in Chandler and this place advertises all over we decided to give it a shot.   First, when you walk in there are two huge doors you walk through. And then there is like no obvious hostess stand. Its just empty. Of course there is nice decor but I have seen WAY better. Nothing to write home about. We stood there awkwardly looking around until someone walked up next to a computer attached to the wall. When you want to guests to think you are a 5 star restaurant and charge those prices you should always have someone there to greet guests so they know where to go. If you want some ideas on how to do this Chop, go to Mastro's, Capital Grille, BLT, etc.   After being shown to our table - it took literally 12 mintues for our server to get to us and on a Friday night this restaurant was not packed so what in the heck?!? We orderd a BOTTLE of Chardonnay. Here is my second angry moment of the night. When someone orders a bottle of wine that needs to stay chilled, you should chill it at the table! The server took it back to the kitchen to keep it cold back there. So anytime we ran out of wine we had to wait until the server came by and ask him to go get it. What a joke!!!  I ordered the special which was grouper for the night. My husband the trout. After my first bite I just started cracking up laughing. You are going to charge me $32 for a piece of fish that was SO over cooked that I had problems pulling a bite off the filet with my fork. It was honestely the worst over cooked piece of fish I have ever had. I can name dozens of restaurants that serve fish properly and for much less than $32 a plate. My husband and I will drop lots of money on our date nights but we better get quality in the food we pay for and this was just god awful.  Needless to say I will never be back, and Chop, please teach your cooks how to properly good food to the doneness the guests want. I heard the table next to us complain about how dry and over done his steak was. Way to over priced, poor service and poor food. A total waste of $200.00."}
{"text":"I am taking off an additional star, rating them at 3/5 entirely based off of the fact that their service is terrible. I would rate them lower if it wasn't for their good food.   I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, and my brother got the Baby Back Ribs. The Ravioli wasn't as great as my server made it out to be, but it wasn't bad. The ribs on the other hand were really good, along with their fries. The ribs fell off the bone & he finished the entire thing.   Onto our server(s?), the first girl that came up to our table didn't even introduce her self & didn't bother asking if we wanted anything to drink. We pretty much knew what we wanted so we ordered after a few questions. After that she was no where to be seen. We didn't have the opportunity to order drinks or anything! I am not sure if it was because we are young (I'm 20 & he is 16) or if it was because I asked questions regarding my Passport Dining Pass (which gives us access to various offers) but we were not taken as seriously as the tables of adults around us.   When our food finally came, a different server brought it out. She continued to wait on us & did actually bring us extra condiments but only when I flagged her down/got her attention first. She was friendly enough though.   Overall, I think that we might have been treated with poor service by the wait staff because of our age & possibly the assumption that we wouldn't tip well? I'm not sure but I definitely won't be leaving an exceptional tip after our experience."}
{"text":"I was invited to a business lecture held here... Food (steak) was over cooked but sides were good.. And Oreo cookie desert was fantastic. Defiantly not an ideal place for a dinner conference / lecture... As there is no way to isolate the notice from the main dining room! Service was overall good.."}
{"text":"I was given a second chance to try CHoP in Chandler and last nights experience was completely different than my first.   Let's start with the staff, last night (a week day evening so the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded) they all were on their game. Our glasses were constantly being refilled, plates were taken away at the appropriate times and the table was checked on often to make sure things were coming out to our liking.   Appetizer: Downtown Fries ($9) - the fries were cooked well, not soggy or overdone. They were seasoned properly and the spicy aioli that come with the fries was great.   Entree: Barbecue Baby Back Ribs ($24) - it has been a while since I have had good ribs. These were fall off the bone delicious! The barbecue sauce was sweet and had a little bit, the meat was tender and not fatty like some ribs can be. I would order these again and recommend them too!   Dessert: Pecan Torte ($7) - the pecans were crispy and the combo with the vanilla ice cream and the butterscotch sauce tied this little dessert together. A tasty little dessert to share as it is rich.   Everything I had last night was on par, the service was up to snuff like a steakhouse should be. Bravo to the staff, chef's and management who made last night a lovely dinning experience."}
{"text":"Props to CHOP for many reasons.  First we were in AZ for work arrived late we arrived close to 9 PM and the kitchen was closed but the amazing manager oniste that night went above and beyond to get us something to eat.  The food was amazing! We had salads, a mix of regular and sweet potato fries along with a few cocktails.  They have the coldest beer in town which was perfect.  Besides the great food, manager and staff the vibe for locals and guests is top notch.  We would recommend this place to anyone visiting or who lives near by and hasn't been.  Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite date night location. Terrific service ... Friendly, informative, and they pay attention to details. Food was delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to dinner here with girlfriends but was very disappointed. We arrived early with plenty of open seating but they sat us in the bar anyway.  Hostesses should gauge the type of diner when choosing a location in which to seat them, not just server load management. Not overly impressed with menu, especially the dinner salads...more like lunch-size, but tasty.  Waitress not very friendly, seemed indifferent at best.  Bar got crowded and became so noisy we could hardly hear each other.  Looks like a good place to go if you want to eat meat and drink, but not for a  nice 'catch-up' dinner with friends. Used a Groupon to try the place... but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place.  I've never seen a steakhouse that didn't offer complimentary bread/rolls and butter.  They didn't have portion sizes listed.  My prime rib was 35.95 and for that price I was expecting a larger portion.  The prime rib was served with no au jus which was a shock.  I ordered it med-rare but it was extremely rare.  It was also tough except on the outside.  It definitely wasn't slow cooked it was cooked fast and that's what happens.  You get it dark on the outside but still red on the inside and tough.  Prime rib is supposed to cut like butter but it was less tender than a steak.  I could barely cut and chew it.  Service wasn't really good either and they sat us right next to the bar and we had to listen to two drunks ramble for an hour.  I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner, party of 11 and it was fantastic ! The food is so good here that everyone in the group kept commenting on how great it was. There was a vegan in the group who also was really pleased with her veggie burger and menu options. The wine list is great, it had expensive to cheap but good wines so you could get exactly what you would need here. It's a great place to dress up or dress down with a group or even just a romantic night out. It's very quiet and dim, so the ambiance is perfect for adult dining. I am not huge on putting a review on yelp, so this place was good enough for me to come out of my way to post this. It was exactly what I wanted in a restaurant for my birthday dinner, thanks to the chef and staff !"}
{"text":"Very good food. Got the pork chop and it was great. Great environment too. Also very friendly and great service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic bottle wine selection. Amazing food for the price. staff very accommodating. The reservation/waiting area/setup/process could be better....however immediately upon ordering a $120 bottle of wine, a great table magically opened up...smart staff :) service was superb!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation here to meet friends at 7:15 and try the restaurant for the first time.  A reservation means nothing except you get to sit and wait until someone leaves, very poorly run restaurant.  We sat at the bar while the ONE bartender ignored the end where we were sitting and tended to guests in the middle or men who seemed to admire her chest.  We waited a good hour then got seated, service continued to be very poor, drinks made wrong 2-3 times, once at the bar then 2 more times at the table!  They kept putting tonic water when asked for club soda.  Dinner took forever, a most painful experience, we will not ever be back for another try!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family here.  Food (NY strip/Prime rib/Mac&Cheese kids/Ribs kids) was good and tasty.  Service was fine and friendly.  Dessert (Peanut butter cheese cake and Pecan Torte were yummy)  decaf coffee was fresh.  Only downside was the noise level - large bday party in the same private dining area.  I liked the decor and the dim lighting ambiance."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic!  You must order the loaded mashed potatoes....so delicious! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, reasonable prices. Definitely recommend for a good quiet night out! Also, probably not super kid friendly Friday or Saturday nights."}
{"text":"So sad to hear that CHOP is no longer doing the Thursday Date Night Special.  We really enjoyed having the excuse to treat ourselves on Thursday.  I hope management brings it back. :-("}
{"text":"Food was amazing service was great! Pecan torte was heavenly! Atmosphere was charming.  This is an excellent restaurant for all occasions.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fine dining this is NOT!! horrible service...no offer of bread, crackers or anything pre meal.  Caesar salal was small and marginal...not worth $7...2 croutons, lettuce and very garlicky dressing.. not even a pleasant presentation. Waitress never removed the menus until we handed them to her with the service of the entrees.  Very loud...asked for a quiet table and we were seated near the bar...then near the end, fortunately ,of our meal, they turned on loud music and the bar patrons started shouting over the top of it...Horrible experience...my friend told her displeasure to the guy who picked up our payment and he did not tell the manager or anyone that we were disappointed.  Nothing but another bar...where the heck is fine dining??? This was not worth our $118-bill at all.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  We make the effort to pass the mall to come here. The staff is top tier the food is awesome. Happy hour til 6, we split the prime rib. Everything is just a bit better than other restaurants, really really good music selection. The community tables were a really good idea. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Another 5 Star!! The Veggie Burger was exceptionally delicious and a BIG shout out to José who made it to perfection!  Another BIG shout out to Jeff, Lauren and Monica! Love the CHoP VIbE!!"}
{"text":"I've been twice, and ChoP didn't disappoint either time.  The grille artichoke is smoky and served with a sauce that was so delicious my 10 year old said he could drink it.  Also a fan of the beef carpaccio.  My only complaint is there isn't enough meat on the plate  Service is outstanding and ambiance very relaxing."}
{"text":"CHOP is solid, that's all there is to it.  Great setting, nice ambience, nice dark mood, while staying fresh and light. It's not your uncle bob's steak house from the 60's, this place is modern, clean, and classy and it fits right in in this nice plaza.  The food is solid, great cuts of meat, nice tender filets of fish, and the starters are filling and tasty. Sweet Potato Fries are perfect, the artichoke dip is too, and I am a HUGE fan of the garlic citrus butter that comes with seafood options.  What I like most is that they offer a rotating, changing specialty menu. One week the special could be swordfish, another week could be Halibut, another rockfish, and all of them are superb. With CHOP you're not getting the same old boring steak and potatoes and old guys routine, you're getting quality, delicious cuts, quality ingredients, a nice modern setting, and an overall fine dining experience.  I'm a regular, they got me hooked at least once per month."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place but the food sucks. The food has no flavor and the presentation is mediocre. I tried a few dishes and was not satisfied. The quality of their food does not match the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations 3 weeks in advance for Valentine's Day, we came from Ahwatukee and due to the weather, heavy rain, and our misguided GPS we were running late. I called and spoke to the hostess to advise them & if they would hold our reservation and was told they would reserve our table. When we arrived the hostess said since we were late it would be a wait if 30-45 minutes! I explained we called ahead and advised we were running late she spoke to another hostess and then sat us at a small high top table next to the wine fridge that was obviously a horrible table. My husband asked to speak to the manager and we were moved to another table.  The food was just ok at best and the cost was comparable to Roy's, capital grill, or Mitchell's. We will never return."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, can't wait to get back to CHoP.  We went with 5 other people and decided to share everything to get a good feel for the menu.  For apps we had the artichokes, which were out of this world.  Just the right texture and smokey flavor.  We also had the salmon app and fries, both were soo good.  The sauces with everything were beyond great too! For meals we had collectively: Salmon with pesto....loved this dish, the salmon was not overwhelmed but complimented by the sauce.   Filet...ummm amazing.  Cooked to perfection with a delicious butter on top. Ribs....really good, tender.  The sauce does have a kick, which was ok by me! Trout   I feel like you don't see trout on the menu in AZ very often, being from the Midwest I was a little skeptical, but it was delicious, seasoned and cooked perfect and the portion was enormous!  Overall, I loved the atmosphere, the waitstaff was so friendly and the food was awesome.  This is a great date night spot or would be a great girls night out!  I can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife and some of her work colleagues for a company dinner.  It has a nice, steakhouse ambiance inside and the service was awesome.  I was told I had to try their babyback ribs (from a frequent diner, against my will) and so I did.  They were overcooked, slathered with sauce and not very appetizing.  I wanted the NY Strip and wish I would have gotten that.  My wife had a filet and it was FANTASTIC!  Made me wish I would have gotten a steak even more.  The appetizers were great, they have a great beer selection, which was served ice cold (always underrated feature).  The staff was very friendly, competent and very prompt.  The waitress did a great job for a large party and she is truly an asset to that place.  I guess I should have gone with my gut, as I LOVE steak.  I smoke ribs often and I should have know better ordering BBQ ribs at an upscale steak joint.  Overall the food was fantastic, from the artichoke appetizer to the desserts.  I would highly recommend this place.  I held back on a fifth star for the poor effort on the ribs."}
{"text":"Best dinner ever!  Called last minute and received a 6:45pm reservation for our 28th wedding anniversary.  We were seated on arrival and found great atmosphere and service.    My wife had the baseball cut top sirloin and I had the prime rib.  The prime rib was the best ever.  It was 1  1/2\" thick and almost covered the plate.  It was cooked to perfection.  My wife few said hers was excellent  The manager served us a bread pudding dessert on the house and congratulated .  We will be returning to patronize Chop."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful birthday celebration meal there, everyone's meal was delicious. We did have trouble seeing the interior and reading the menus as it was so dark in there."}
{"text":"If I could give this review a 2.5, I would.  My wife and I went to Chop for date night, and frankly, we could've had the exact same meal at our neighborhood Applebee's (and we haven't been to an Applebee's in over 20 years).   I will say the cocktails were very good (strawberry mojoto and Lynchburg lemonade).  The calamari appetizer was extremely chewy and rubbery.   The bacon on the wedge salad tasted burnt.  We asked for bread, and the server literally brought us ONE slice of dry, prepackaged bread cut in half!   As far as the entrees, the Maui ribeye steak was mediocre at best.  I asked for horseradish sauce on the side, which tasted like it came out of the bottle.  The ribs were a bit skinny,  but the sauce was good. The macaroni and cheese was gritty and lacked flavor,  probably because the chef overcooked the bechamel sauce.  I will say the service was very good, but I honestly feel like we paid $100 for a meal worth no more than $50. Given the number of customers (we went on a Saturday night), Chop has the potential to be more like a Scottsdale restaurant if they step their game up a few notches.  If they are going to charge, Scottsdale prices, then they need to offer a similar product (i.e., don't serve food in dishes lined with paper!)."}
{"text":"Me, my wife and her best friend of 25 years, decided to try this place based on a google search under \"steakhouses\". The first thing i noticed when we arrived was that it was a huge bar with lots of bar seating, very few dining booths with the bar in the center and the dining booths in a U-shape surrounding the bar. A waitress came buy, eventually, and took our drink order and dropped off three bread plates. We asked for two iced teas and a water with lemon. She apparently didn't like our non-alcoholic order, as it took 20 minutes to see her again. When the drinks arrived, they were peach iced tea, not what I asked for..... We placed our order: prime rib, sirloin and grilled salmon.The food finally came and i tried to tell the waitress about the tea mix-up, but she darted away as soon as she dropped off our meals. A busboy comes buy twenty minutes after the meal has started and drops off the bread. I try to tell him about the tea. He tells me, \"We don't have a big selection of drinks that are non-alcohol,\" then he darts away, taking our bread plates with him(We only received one little piece of bread). After we finally received our food order, it was the last we saw of our waitress until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, if you are real heavy duty drinker and you want a place to \"really put 'em away, this is your place, as it is 75% bar.  If you are looking for a nice family style steakhouse, this is not the the place!  With prices that start at $25.00 for the cheapest entree, you can do much better elsewhere. You'll get better service as well. Drive past this place, your're not missing much. Drink up......"}
{"text":"I have no clue why people give this place less than 4 stars. Just ate here for the first time. Ambience is great. Dark, romantic lighting, cool vibe. Had a great corner booth as well.  Our server Matt was super friendly and cool. Gave excellent recommendations on both food and wine.   We started with Ahi Tuna and Crab Cakes. Ahi perfectly seared. Crab Cakes were crisp on an amazing slaw.  Then a great Wedge salad with house made blue cheese. Dressing was incredible. Not creamy. More of a heavy blue vinegarette which I prefer.  For main course, probably the 2 best entrees on the menu. Center cut filet and braised short rib. Highly recommend either.  Finished off with Toffee bread pudding, which the restaurant comped because it was an anniversary celebration.   Will definitely be frequenting Chop on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, as always however the service was terrible. I made a reservation for 7 and indicated it was my Mother-in-laws birthday. The waitress was uninterested and only checked in to take our order. The bar guy was engaging, but we expected a lot more from our dining experience. For $400+ dinner for 7, we look for much better service. No one even acknowledged the special occasion until we were leaving. The bus boy was nice. Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Chop Chandler provides a great dining experience for everyone. I personally love the patio that they recently opened especially because of the great weather we have in Chandler. All of the servers go out of their way to make the customers feel welcome and enjoy their meal. I have never ordered anything that I was unhappy with. Some of my favorite meals are the pork chop, streak salad, and the filet. Every time my family and I have been the Chop we have never been disappointed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant. The host was too young and didn't know much but we were able to find an open table by the bar. The decor is very pleasing to the eye but not to comfortable on the back. The chairs have little to no back support and the bench type sitting is less to be desired even with the pillows they provide (an obvious sign they knew it wasn't comfortable). Menu has a wide selection of different types of food, just not much on the menu. My wife and I chose the sirloin. The portions were ridiculously small especially for the large price. Our dinner could have been served on a tea saucer. The food was great and we did enjoy it. I can honestly say I felt like the portions were appetizer size. At the end of my meal I was looking to see if my wife was going to eat all of hers (unfortunately she did). Overall they are doing good. Portions and price are my major issues."}
{"text":"Last night was our second and last trip to CHoP.  We went back on a date night a few months ago and had a horrible experience. Our reservation wasn't on time, some other issues and as a result we got a 25% off card for next time.  Last night was the next time.  Our reservation was timely,  it that was about it. It took over an hour to get our main course. We went at 8:00 pm, so this wasn't the main dinner rush at all. Our server was nice, but not fully attentive. We presented our 25% off card early on after seating so I was a little surprised there was no real follow up on the restaurant behalf. Waters repeatedly went empty on multiple occasions.  The table next to us sent their food back for some issues.  Our meal itself is why I give it a 2 rather than a 1.  The filet was excellently prepared, but the baked potato left something to be desired.  When we got the bill  25% discount wasn't applied, so we had to send it back.  With the food options in the San Tan Valley, this place just isn't worth the money for the service you receive."}
{"text":"We love this place. Everything about their menu is great. It's perfect for a date night and I love the patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, as well as the atmosphere. However, I expected great things after we tasted the \"Awesome Fries\". There were AWESOME, as expected! However, when our steak came along with sweet potato fries and macaroni and cheese, I was a little disappointed.   The steak was cooked perfectly. However, the flavor wasn't there. I don't think it was worth $34. For a few more bucks, I can go to Flemings and have flavorful steak. The sweet potato fries seemed a little boring after having the Awesome Fries. The cheese in the macaroni was far too overpowering.   However, I would go back and have appetizers and drinks there, as it seemed fun and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this place..   We usually head north to Scottsdale for dinner, but decided to head south this time and try Chop.  We made reservations and we were a little early so we hung out by the door. I really liked the look a feel of the place, nice and dark and lively without being too loud. A really nice guy came and asked if we wanted a drink while we waited. He was very knowledgeable, personable and efficient. If we had stayed standing at the door this restaurant would have gotten 5 stars.  Instead we were seated. The booth was comfortable. We waited a while for a server to acknowledge us, but I was ok with that since we already had a drink. When she did come over she didn't show much knowledge of the menu. We ordered and the food came out in what seemed like 5 minutes, too fast for a made to order steak.  They dropped the food off and no one came to check if we had what we needed. My wine glass was empty the server looked at it numerous times and never asked if I needed another. I like wine with my steak. I had to flag her down for another.   Now to the food. It was OK. My steak was cooked perfectly. It was just way over salted! I almost couldn't eat it, but no one came by to ask so I ate what I could. The Brussels sprouts were under cooked. My husband loved his short ribs.   Now to dessert ... I asked our girl of any of the desserts could be made gluten-free. She looked  at the menu and said \"you're good! For all of them!\" Now, I know I can not have graham crackers and pie crusts, etc. I said I don't think I'm good, she looked again and said \"yep! If it doesn't have stars next to it you're safe!\"  The opposite was true, the stars denote an item is gluten-free.   I would give this place another try, it has potential. I would recommend training the staff better. Our server  was very nice, but did not know the menu or how to be attentive."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night and everything was excellent. I had the rib eye cooked medium rare and it came out excellent. Steak was great quality. Some others at the table ordered the pork chops. They said it was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday and had great food AND service!! I ordered the Bronzino and my friend ordered the bbq ribs. Our server McKenna had great recommendations and was extremely friendly. We ended our night with the bread pudding. It was the perfect end to our evening! Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Jeff and Lauren are Amazing bartenders and very attentive to their customers.  Amazing and fun cocktails. Great happy hour.  Wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to dine at Fleming's, but my boyfriend wanted to try something new, so we went on Yelp and stumbled upon Chop. I was seriously blown away. The ambiance is industrial and romantic. We were sat right away (make reservations) and greeted by our server MATT. He was absolutely amazing. So friendly and knowledgeable. We got a bottle of prisoner wine, followed by some yummy dirty martinis. We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer, which were just okay. BUT the steaks were amazing. We each got the center cut cooked medium rare. I forgot which dessert we got (It was a recommendation by Matt), but it was seriously a great ending to our meal. It is literally my new favorite steakhouse and possibly my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited Chop Chandler on a Friday night for the first time with a Groupon.   I am not understanding some of the complaints, I think some people are just not happy unless they are complaining.    Food was fantastic, service was exceptional.     We had a 7:00 reservation and arrived very early, the place was packed.  So we headed to the bar for a cocktail and were quickly acknowledged, received our drinks in a very timely matter, specially considering how busy the bar was.  We were seated earlier than our reservation was for and quickly received water and only minutes later our waiter arrived.  He had several tables and from what I witnessed, he did a outstanding job with all the tables.  We had the shrimps cocktail, the shrimp were huge and fresh.  I had the salmon, it was perfectly seasoned and cook.  My husband had the pork chop, it had to of been 3 inches thick and perfectly ch-arched, cooked all he way through, moist and delicious.  Finished with the lemon creme brulee, YUM"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just had our rehearsal dinner here. I literally could not have asked for better service or food! We will absolutely be back, I'd recommend Chop for any large event or party as well. Everything flowed beautifully, the private room is beautiful, and the service was incredible."}
{"text":"The service is why I give this restaurant only 3 stars. I've been back to Chop twice and both times the food has been pretty good but the service us been really poor and it was not busy at all. Let me explain... We ordered drinks, someone else brought the drinks out and we didn't see our server for quite awhile. When she finally came back, we ordered an appetizer and someone else brought it out. At that point, the server said she was leaving for awhile and we would have someone else step in and assured us we would be well taken care of while she was gone. She described the girl who was replacing her but we never had the fill-in server approach our table. She walked by us many times helping tables around us but never stopped by to see how our food was, if we were doing ok, if we needed anything else. It almost became a joke. She finally came by and filled out water but didn't ask how anything was or if she could get us anything else. We finally had to stand to get our check. Even though the food is really good and the restaurant is trying to create an atmosphere of high quality, until they retrain their wait staff or hire ones who know what good service is, we will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place out for a while, so i was happy to get and then use a Groupon.  I am happy that I finally made it here.  We dined on great steaks and had fabulous service.  I will defiantly be back as this is a great local steakhouse."}
{"text":"The server was polite and that's really about it.  Chop is trying to place themselves as a fine dinning restaurant, unfortunately this is no Mastros City Hall, Steak 44 or Flemmings.  We went on a Thursday night, it was not very busy.  I ordered a Pork Chop and my wife a filet, and a bottle of red wine.  I received my Pork Chop (approx 2\" thick) and took a bite, it was very tough and not good at all.  I do not send food back, but this was really bad.  I had my wife try it and she said it was really tough and I should send it back.  I then decided to split the chop down the middle and the chop was still refrigerator cold.  I told our waitress and she also touched the center and agreed it was refrigerator cold.  She was very sorry and I told her not a problem and I would just order a filet as well.   She said she would put a rush on it.  At this point, I am not upset and I understand, sometimes food is not prepared correctly and this one was definitely  refrigerator cold in the middle and not cooked.   Now, upscale and even chain restaurants, a GM or manager will stop by and apologize and see if there's anything else they can do to help you.  The biggest disappointment was that 20 minutes later, not only did I not have my filet, but the manager, Jill, never stopped by until I finally asked to speak to the manager.  I didn't realize the manager was the person I observed cleaning the wine glasses behind the bar for some time, I thought she was the bartender.  When she finally showed up, both my wife and I were surprised that she was the GM and/or manager and she was insulted when I thought she was the bartender.  I was pretty upset that she didn't personally come up to us at all and we had to ask for the manager.  After a few more minutes, I finally had my filet.  You would think, that Jill would follow up a few minutes later to make sure to check on us and see if my filet was cooked correctly, nope!  If this is the manager, this place is in trouble.  If you don't care about your patrons, then a business will eventually fail.  I could not be more disappointed by the way we were treated.  The pork chop was cold, but not as cold as the manager.  Very disappointed in the food, and more so, their manager."}
{"text":"So had the groupon for this place and as you know MOST of the time the restaurant is poor-fair at best. I have to say this has been our best groupon meal since we started.  The food is a little expensive to just pay staight up, but we saw that all during the week they have different specials like spend $50 get $25, kids eat free (but I would never take mine there) specials on drinks and such like that, that make it more worth it for sure. We had the potatoe fritts and they were awesome. A little spicy but in a good way. We only ordered ice teas and was fine there. I saw they had Kiltlifter on draft and that always gets me happy, $5 normally so Im sure better during the slower times so I will have to have a few of those next times! I ordered the baseball cut (never heard of that before) sirloin and it was PERFECT. No need for A1. no a scrap of fat on it. Got the loaded potatoe and also was close to perfect. big, fluffy, all the fixins and a light salt coating that is a favorite of mine. I would have liked the plate to have some sort of garnish to make the plate look a little more complete. Wife had the steak something (smaller cut flat iron steak I believe) with the potatoe also. Quite a smaller portion but it was aout $7 cheaper, she was eyeing up my steak after she took care of hers haha! We also shared the mac&cheese, very tastey! great way to complete the meal. We would have like some vegatables to go with it but thought ordering a side of that also would seem to much. Dessert we got the lemon creme brulee and oreo sandwich. The creme was perfectly torched for the sugar and very good. Oreo was a bit heavy but tasted great with warm hot fudge on the bottom. Great to dip the sandwich in. Coffee was also good. Great romantic place for dinner that is for sure! I know this place could be suffering because there is nothing around it, and would no doubt be a bigger success in a more populated area. 100% sure we will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere were great! The cocktails are superb. Definately a place to revisit!"}
{"text":"I had a special request and Chris, GM, went above and beyond what I even hoped for!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at Chop. The staff has always treated us well and restaurant is organized. If there is ever a mistake, they are quick to fix. I think the Management has done an outstanding job of turning this place into a local hangout. I take my coworkers in that come from out of town every time.   My recommendations: Stone IPA and Prime Rib with creamy horseradish.   Keep up the great work, we love this place!"}
{"text":"It's expensive. That's what you'll notice as soon as you see the menu. But first, you'll see beautiful decor and be greeted by excellent servers/bartenders. The food is fantastic. The service makes it worth it."}
{"text":"We discovered Chop completely by accident several months ago. It has quickly become one of our favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is fantastic, the food is phenomenal, the staff is second to none!  What makes this restaurant truly a class act is the owner, he's incredibly personable, he talks to us every time, shares pictures of his family and their dogs. My 9yo daughter absolutely adores him. My family and I highly recommend Chop, it's perfect if if you're coming from a business meeting or fancy event... and you won't feel out of place if you're just swinging by wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Chop is able to accommodate everyone without anybody feeling out of place."}
{"text":"An excellent date night or even nice meal with family. I wouldn't suggest bringing the kiddos. The food is incredible and the staff is great. Jason and I met my father here and we had a perfect experience."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Our waiter Nick was amazing!!! The price of alcohol and the \"manager\" and bartender Bernie is the reason we will never be going back.   We used to be a regular patron of this place, but today a double of Oban 14 cost $36!!! More than any of the entrees we got!! When we brought this to the attention of Bernie he asked me what I would like him to do and walked away, but not before being completely rude.   After speaking with a second manager, a pretty brunette woman, we still paid full price and only had half-ass apologies and excuses.   Shame because the food and ambience is great, but the price increase in alcohol is ridiculous and their managers are worthless.   Tom K. is known for such great service, and Bernie will be the ruin of this brand's reputation."}
{"text":"I really struggled between a three and four star rating. I wish there were halves but the \"A-OK\" description on the three star seemed to fit with our experience at CHoP.  My boyfriend's parents were in town from Ohio and we wanted to take them to a nice restaurant nearby for Father's Day. We made reservations at CHoP for 7:30pm, showed up right at 7:30pm and then waited about ten minutes before we were seated. This bugs the crap out of me and reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld - \"You just don' t know how to HOLD the reservation!\" The wait wouldn't have been SO bad had there actually been a waiting area. You literally walk in the door and are faced with the hostess, who is basically working out of what can only be described as a sideways cabinet. Anywhere you stand, you were in the way of guests trying to leave, guests coming through the door and waitresses going to the other side of the room.  Once we were seated we were greeted by our waiter and got some apps ordered. The calamari was a smidge on the rubbery side but not overly greasy and the sauce was tasty. The parents got spinach dip, which was described as \"good, but there's too much spinach and not enough dip\".   Sadly, they were out of scallops and something else that 1/2 of our table wanted to order. Our dinner took about 25-30 minutes to come out because our ticket was apparently put in right after a ticket for 20 people. I can only comment on my entree and my boyfriend's steak because the other guests described their meals as just good. The seasoning on my chicken was tasty and it was well cooked. The macaroni and cheese was just eh. The cheeses they used didn't seem to add much of a cheesy flavor (weird, I know) and it was more gritty than creamy. The boyfriend's steak seemed to be charred on both sides but he said it was still tender. His baked potato was room temperature.  All in all, a decent dinner but the chances of us returning are slim."}
{"text":"Love this place it's perfect for date night great atmosphere and very mature feel. I had the trout it was so flavorful and cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"I attended a function at Chop on Tuesday night and while the food is always great, I wanted to give a special shout-out to Monica who served all of the guests on the patio with speed, efficiency and a smile.  She was exceptional the entire evening and deserving of special kudos!"}
{"text":"Went to Chop last night for dinner. I had been there once before and was not overly impressed. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had made some changes to the menu. I had the portobello mushroom burger (I don't eat meat) with the fried zucchini. So totally yummy!! I had the Vegi burger last time and it was good, but not memorable. Friends raved about the short ribs and burger. Service was great and I love the atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, the restaurant itself is gorgeous and has a great vibe. The location is also awesome.   Now for the hostess...did not have a great vibe...she seemed like she was super unhappy being there the entire time we were there. Maybe she was having a bad day?...  Our server was awesome for the time being...until he disappeared on our table with no warning. 20 minutes later a new server came to check on us and she was attentive.   The food was average, I ordered the rib eye with a loaded potato. The steak was ok but a little under seasoned and the potato was dry.   Over all, we left disappointed. It was not a consistent experience therefore I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner. Sadly the Yelp menu for this place way beyond WRONG. The menu was limited and to be called a steak,seafood and burgers is a farce. The seafood was sadly limited to only 2 options. The crab cakes were luke warm at best. All appetizers came out except mine, crab cakes so by the time I got mine everyone else was done. Not a great start. They had a specialty martini that was described so deliciously I ordered one. Turns out it tasted like a watered down lemoncelo. Dinner came and it was just ok. Nothing to write a ton about sadly. The place was decorated cute but dark... Our server was attentive, descriptive and nice. Probably the only highlight of our meal. For the price, won't be back."}
{"text":"The 5 stars breaks down like this: 1 GOLD Star for Monica, 4 stars for the food. We started with awesome fries because with a name like that how can you pass it up?! They were good. My husband ordered the pork chop and it was ginormous, he chose the cauliflower gratin and squash for aides, both of which were good. I ordered the short rib with polenta and it was so yummy, a little on the salty side, but still cooked to perfection! Our daughter (8) ordered the loaded potato side, haha, she loved it. Overall, it was good and we will definitely return and request to be seated in Monica's section. She was very nice and very attentive, just as a great waiter should be!"}
{"text":"You know - it wasn't bad. For the money, it wasn't good either. Nothing we ordered was awesome. The crab cakes were ... tasteless. It did NOT taste like crab. It was almost like a white fish cake was made, no seasonings and then deep fried. I added salt and lemon - but just wasn't worth it. The lamb chops were tasty and done perfectly. I had the mint Chimmichurri on the side and thank goodness! It was probably exactly how it was supposed to be, but I would have hated it on my meat. Very much like eating mint our of a garden with a side of bermuda grass. My husbands steak and side was good. The deserts were fine. Other than the crab cake - nothing was bad - just meh. For $150 before tip for two people - I would rather go to Mastros. Ambiance was nice - a little dark and very 'bar' centric. Service was decent."}
{"text":"Top notch service and food! We always go here for special occasions and it's fantastic every time. Ribeye with the Maui marinade is to die for!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to CHoP often and always have a great experience.  We are always satisfied with our food, atmosphere and all around experience.  The scallops with crispy kale is amazing!  We are always greeted immediately upon walking in.  The service has always been good.  The last few times that we've gone there has been a female manager on the floor that will NEVER come to our table to see how everything is.  She will walk past us, look at us sometimes but will keep going.  She's never really smiling either.  Overall I love this place and will continue to go back.  The manager needs to make more of an effort to visit the tables more."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant. Ordered the specials.... Halibut, green beans, spaghetti squash. Very tasty. Service was very good, attentive. My only comment is that the atmosphere was a little loud with music and people talking... not sure if it was because we were sitting closer to the bar area or not. Overall it was a nice experience"}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times. I'm in town for business constantly and often stay at the hotel across the road. The service is always great (4.5-5 star) but the food has always been 'a bit' to very disappointing. I go back because the service makes me feel like it could be good.   But the food...   And it is menu items I didn't think you could mess up. Last time it was the Caesar salad which was covered in little dried capers that did nothing for it...actually ruined it. This time it's a wedge salad that is drowning in a very poorly made, oily blue cheese dressing. Similarly, I didn't think you could get calamari that was too bad. But I ordered that last time and it was tossed too much salt and chili...to the point I couldn't eat it even with much shaking and brushing. I've had the mashed potatoes as a side and they're pretty mediocre. I have had a good steak here so there's hope for that.   If you want a place with great service and good wine/drinks, this is a winner. If you want enjoyable food, this place is way too hit or miss."}
{"text":"Just great food, amazing wait staff, and best of all affordable.  Atmosphere is great.   Our wait staff, Nicholas was very attentive and made sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. Very impressed with the prompt service, timing of courses, and quality of food. I've been all around the country to many steakhouses and this ranks up there with the best of them. I'll definitely be back in future."}
{"text":"We had fantastic service (thank you, Chris). Everyone was friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding.  You have to try their potato soup - it's to die for, and the steak frites was delicious as well. The atmosphere was perfect for date night and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time there and we were pleasantly surprised!  My dad had a juicy thick steak cooked to perfection!  I had wedge salad and chicken satay. My dads mashed potatoes was a large amount and very delicious!  Took home pecan torte and it was very rich and perfect. My only complaint is they are not open for lunch!  They would get lots of customers with Intel down the street."}
{"text":"My wife took me here on a date night last night. She made 6:45 reservations. When we arrived we were told they were behind on reservations but we were second in line. Another party with the same reservation time was waiting at the bar. Then another couple came in, also with the same reservation time as us. They were seated before us for whatever reason, as I and my pregnant wife were left to stand in the seatingless area in front of the hostess. We were seated 20 mins after our reservation.  We got the spinach & artichoke dip, mac and cheese, onion rings and a bbq burger. The dip was very bland. We rarely find the need to add salt to any restaurant food, but tried that and pepper but it didn't help much. The onion rings were just ok. The burger was a big disappointment. It wasn't the size I'd expect from a steak/chop house. It was cooked well, but the flavor was nothing amazing. And for it being a bbq burger, there was barely any sauce; so little you could see the line drawn on the bun of where it was squirted. The mac and cheese was good and maybe the only redeeming dish we had.   Our server was very friendly and once the food came, attentive.   I would not go back. A place with the principles to seat a party that arrives after you do, in front of you, after you'd be told 'you're next' and to do so without a word of explanation or apology is not a place I want to give my money to. So that was the biggest factor to us. Not honoring or reservation time (which pushed us enough that we had to reschedule our after dinner plans) was another. And for going for a nice dinner out and not feeling we got that with the product we received was really the third strike. We'll try somewhere else new next time where we're at least respected as customers."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner here last night. Initially sat at the bar waiting for a table. Would have liked to sit outside but host stated it was too windy when they started to set up. Unfortunate for the revenue that night. Was a nice night.   Asked the bartender if they had any special types of mules they made. Response was essentially...not really. Orderd a regular one. Was a little strong for me.  I had the green Chile burger w/o bun. Added bacon, egg & caramelized onion. It was cooked just as I asked. Would order again.   The fried pickles as a side were good. Accept for the clumped up ones that were a little soggy.   Pecan tort for desert. Very good if your in the mood for sweet stuff. If you like pecan pie with vanilla ice cream you'll like it.   Restaurant  has a dark candle lit romantic setting.   I would give a 3.5 on rating if offered.  Side note to mgmnt. Step it up a notch, if you want to compete with downtown chandler."}
{"text":"The food was delicious (swordfish & green chile burger). However, the service was terrible. I don't even know who our server was. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed date night here this past weekend. We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip. It was delicious. For dinner I had the green chili burger. It wasn't as good as my husband's bbq burger, but it was still good. We followed it up with the pecan torte and a toffee rice pudding that was a special. So delicious. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Service: Standard, nothing to write home about. Decor: Romantic, dark and rustic Cuisine: Large portions, big enough to split with partner.  Wine: Nice selection. I adored Uppercut. Spirits: Well-made.  An oops on my husband's after dinner drink, the bartender actually caught upon service though. Entertainment: I love anywhere with live music and could careless how good they are if they have a good vibe! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Good..  Service:  there on a Wed so the place was nearly empty. Thus, we got thier full attention. The bartender, who I suspect was the manager, was great. We did not like the Pinot on happy hour (tasted like grape juice) even after he opened a ne bottle. They had no problem replacing it with his pairing for our dishes and he comp'd a desert since we were celebrating the birth of our 2nd child.  Food: We had the Pork Chop (5 stars) & Pork Loin (3 stars).  Chop was perfect, nothing more to say there. Loin had nice flavor with a bit of smoke but was way too dry even with the sauce. If it was moist it would have been  5 stars.  Areas for improvement: Very Dark , though eye adjusted OK after a bit Very cold - needed to be a bit warmer to be 100% comfortable Music went from OK to very bad electronic music. Need something more consistant to set the atmosphere better IMO   We will be going back."}
{"text":"Loved it! From the key lime martini (yum!), to the fried pickles (sliced thin and crispy just the way I like them). Had the Maui ribeye and chose the cauliflower gratin as our side. Could have eaten a bucket full of them! Asked for our dessert to come with the meal so we would be sure to try it. Several staff stopped by to tell us how fun that was! We asked what the music playlist was and the manager went so far as writing down the Spotify info. Awesome night, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent menu, some prices seem a bit high but the selection is good. Not many places carry a baseball cut on a regular menu, and at $22 I couldn't pass up my favorite cut of meat. Great wine selection, iffy beer selection. Service was solid, but a bit discombobulated as we were asked if we wanted new drinks three times in about 5 minutes. May have been a shift change or trainee though, as everything else was good. My only real complaint was the texas toast they serve does not really go with the \"honey butter\" they serve alongside it. Overall, its nice to have a new steak joint in town that offer some quality cuts!"}
{"text":"Staff are absolutely wonderful people. If you go to Chop you will not be disappointed. Food is great, drinks are on point and with great people waiting on you...you can't lose!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this restaurant over a year ago. I finally came here last night with my fiance. The Groupon expired, but I used the cash value I still had. We had a great experience from start to finish. The host was kind and let us choose where we wanted to sit. I was hesitant to come based on some negative reviews I read, but fortunately for us our experience was wonderful. The server was smart, positive, and helpful, everything was perfectly timed. Nice sophisticated upscale classy environment. The  Chicken Satay was marinated and cooked SO well. Delicious. The broccoli with parmesan cheese was soft and the cheese was fresh, not the cheap dry powder stuff, but real cheese. Delicious! The sirloin steak was great, but honestly, the next time I go I am going to order the sauteed chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. Loaded potato was alright, little dry, nothing crazy, needed sauce or something, took some mushrooms and put them on the baked potato. Not a deal breaker though. The server and hostess both greeted us with a warm and gracious smile, they seemed genuinely happy to be working there. I am excited to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by my first and probably last visit to Chop last Saturday night.   The problems started with the hostess, nice enough, but clearly confused. I waited 45 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived. The service was piecemeal and I wasn't really sure who our actual server was. The manager took our order and followed up when she could, she was nice enough to offer a larger table than the smaller one that we were initially seated. That effort was the highlight of our night. Others brought our food and the occasional drink refill. But my wife waited 20 minutes for a glass of red wine and was never asked if she wanted another.   The menu was uninspired. We started with a spinach dip and chips and an order of fried calamari. Neither very memorable. Each of us had burgers and fries. All the food came out quickly and was fine, but we left expecting something better.   The location and atmosphere are great, although from what we sampled of the menu and service, that's what Chop has going for it. All flash and very little substance. At least that was our experience on a moderately busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day special: 2 entrees and a bottle of wine.  Excellent Corvina and pork chop. Somewhat noisy."}
{"text":"Thank you Groupon, for yet again another new restaurant to try out at the right price.  For ambiance / decor, I give this place five stars.  Sadly, everything else fell short.  Started with the artichoke dip - which is for some reason served with a side of sour cream and bottled or canned salsa.  It just wasn't seasoned, and felt like it was missing a component, even after being salt & peppered.  The wedge salad, which I'm adding a picture of, was tasty, but was served on such a tiny plate that much of it ended up on the table after trying to cut it.  Ordered the filet, medium, and while the flavor was good - having a $38 steak come out over-cooked at a nice steakhouse is always disheartening.  Why didn't I send it back?  Well, let's just say that on this particular night, 80% of the service and attention was being given to a large group to the side who were consuming copious amounts of over-priced wine.  For the sides, I got the loaded baked potato and creamed spinach, both of which were spot on.  So the lesson learned here, is that while ambiance and image are important, they will never trump quality or service.  In other words, check this place out if it's on a discount or specially priced night - otherwise, spend your hard earned money at Durant's if you want the whole package."}
{"text":"11/12/17 Another stellar experience at CHoP. Perfectly seasoned and grilled strip steak, sweet and tender onion rings, crab cakes beyond any I've ever tasted anywhere in the U.S., and service beyond exceptional. We will continue to have our special occasions like wedding anniversaries exclusively at CHoP because they've earned our loyalty with amazing food and the way they always treat us like royalty, even anticipating our needs."}
{"text":"Got a gift certificate to The Chop, a restaurant in the Downtown Ocotillo retail plaza at Queen Creek and Price in Chandler. Probably would not have gone there otherwise, because it was pricey, but seemed like a great way to celebrate our wedding anniversary. And boy it was! The first thing you notice when you step inside is how dark it is compared to the bright sun of the Sonoran Desert. It has tasteful dark wood and dark brown leather upholstery throughout. It also features lovely candlelight and modern but warm light fixtures. There are big comfortable and decorative throw pillows scattered throughout the banquettes. Everyone is very friendly from the greeter to the waitstaff. I had checked out the menu in advance online, which was good as it took my eyes quite awhile to adjust to the difference in light, so I kinda knew what I wanted. Hubby and I were both pleasantly surprised to see so many vegetarian items on the menu considering it is a steakhouse (we are vegetarians, him moreso than me -- I will eat fish and seafood). Luckily we arrived during happy hour so I got a discounted Shock Top from their prodigious drink menu; hubster just got a diet Coke, but they always made sure his drink was refilled plus we got waters without having to ask. I ordered macaroni and cheese with pancetta and tomato basil soup; he ordered a veggie burger and spaghetti squash. Everything was so good we did some sharing back and forth and relived the feeding each other cake thing from our wedding reception. We had told the greeter it was our wedding anniversary, and she told our waiter and he gave us a free dessert, complete with lit candle, some kind of chocolate peanut butter affair with ice cream on top with two spoons that was absolutely scrumptious. We used up our whole gift card, but it was so worth it! For a special occasion, or even just drinks after work, this is the place to go! (Oh, also, if you want to watch the game, although the sound on the TVs was muted.) Definitely a don't-miss destination!"}
{"text":"No, WE DID NOT HAVE A GROUPON, we paid full price. My wife and I went on a double date her with another couple. Just as a side note...My wife is pregnant. We started off by ordering two apps, both artichoke dips. Both were super grease all over! Chips were blah, dip was below comparable to a hole in the wall bars food. To be honest it was probably microwaved. Chilli's has better dip then this dump. Out of the four dinners, three came out to our table wrong. My wife who again is prego, was served a moldy...yes, moldy baked potato. When we told our server who was also prego, she didn't even care. Took it back to change out, and didn't bother to bring a new one or anything else out to us until we reminded her.  A steak that was ordered medium, came out rare as a rare could get before it a health code violation was broken. The meat looked like it was about to still give a \"moooooo.\" But hey, some people are into their meat that way. The salad I orderd was deeeeesgusting disgusting disgusting. I would have rather eaten a middle school cafeteria lunch. The lettuce was straight out of a Dole brand bag. Not even the good brand, the bottom shelf $1.29 bag where it's all red cabbage, a few carrots, and two pieces of green.   I think you get the point. We acknowledge the problems to our server who didn't give two______(fill in the blank)____.  Being good people, we paid our bill, left an above average tip (20%) and now letting the community know what they can possibly expect as well. This place got a reputation at first as being a great place, but has since tanked. I feels it's just a name, don't get luared into going because it's trendy. You'll regret it and remember that this review told you not to.  All the best,  The honest guy"}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good...   Service was just ok, not bad at all.. but it could have been better at the start.. once we got going it was fine.  I thought some of the items were a bit too pricey for what they were.  If we are going to pay $40 for a steak, it should be a very good steak .. and it should  be a little bit larger!! Granted I understand that a steak is not HUGE to begin with , however this was $40 and a TINY piece of meat. I felt kind of bad for my guy... So, to pay over $100 for the meal and still be sort of hungry when leaving is unacceptable in my eyes."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with advising you not to go here. With so many options there really is no reason to NOT enjoy your night out at dinner.   Pros -easy to get reservation -has a deal on groupon -the physical set up of the restaurant is nice and that's where the greatness ends -Live music (not in my taste but nice to have)  Neutrals -Server took forever to get to the table..which honestly didn't matter because I was with someone who I love spending time with -Food was okay. Spinach artichoke dip is good but then again it's good at Applebee's too...for half the price. Rib eye was yummy, trout was yummy...I mean I expect the food to be good...it wasn't amazing or like something I'm craving now...but at least I have zero complains about it being \"bad\" tasting.  -Food came out at pretty good timing although entrees closely timed with appetizer I'm not that picky  Cons -the service was HORRIBLE: -No clue what the servers name was so let's call her \"terrible server\" TS for short -TS took forever to bring our drinks...so they tasted accordingly...like ice watered down my overpriced cocktail.  -TS came to take the food order and didn't show up again until we were half way done with the meal....this means someone else brought out appetizer, someone else brought out entrees...and then she showed up (what if there was something wrong with the order or if we needed something?) -she finally shows up and get this..this is what TS says \"I don't want you guys to think I'm ditching you so I'm going to transfer you to someone else\" -First of all you'd need to be there in order to ditch us and second- who leaves a table when they are DONE eating? **I wonder if this was done on purpose cause she knew she sucked and it would now be a table under someone else's name? But I doubt TS is that smart. -After 13 minutes a new server shows up....13 min doesn't seem like a long time but it is when you're done with your food, drinks are empty, and you're waiting to leave....waiting....waiting....ditched by TS and waiting... -New server asks if we need anything and instead of dessert we just want to get out of there now...so we ask for box and check.  -Tab arrives, we pay (we tip based on check not service-dumb I know) and we leave.   I am going to say what I always say when we get poor service (which is rare) and guess that TS had a bad day...maybe her b/f ditched her...pun intended...but either way I don't go to restaurants and order overpriced food to NOT enjoy myself.   Chop this one right off your list people! I warned you."}
{"text":"First time at Chop....made reservations via their website.  Seated immediately.  Excellent service.  We had the zucchini chips which we loved!  Dessert was comped as it was my best friends birthday dinner.  She had the pecan torte and loved it.  We will definitely return!!!   Excellent customer service from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"A Groupon is what brought me into the restaurant initially and the decor is beautiful inside and out.  It was a very long wait but decided to stick it out.  The inside is a bit small but in the winter the outside patio will be used for sure.  The seating also included the bar area and I am picky about that.  For just hanging out that is wonderful but for a romantic dinner it could be a bit crowded and uncomfortable.  There isn't many options in that regard because of the limited space.  The food was really good.  I had the ribs & chicken on two different occasions.  I can't remember if it is on Wednesday or Thursday nights but they have a special for coupled up folks that is a good price."}
{"text":"How anyone could give this place less than 5 stars is beyond me. The prices are a little higher than I was expecting but once you're in there it makes sense. The food is made from scratch, it's crazy delicious, and the service is awesome. I had the ribs which were the definition of fall of the bone. My wife had the salmon. She isn't a big fan of salmon but loved it. The fried pickles were amazeballs as well. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I will say Chop is pretty cool inside and has a great ambiance. The service was great and they have a pretty decent wine list. The reason for the three stars is that the price you pay for the quality of food is kind of a rip off. Not that the food was bad but I would rate high if t was about 10-15 dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"Dined here twice. Both times the bar tenders were awesome. Both times the food was exceptional.   For some reason our waitress was not very good on our second visit. Just not attentive or what I would expect for this level of restaurant.   Not horrible just not great.   The steak is absolutely amazing.   Will definitely return. This is our new fav steak spot."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants! Great ambiance, excellent food, and top-notch service. I've enjoyed date nights here and work dinners as well. The salmon and spaghetti squash are my favorites.  I recommend making reservations because it gets busy in the evening. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Made reservation and went here for our anniversary dinner.  Excellent from start to finish.  Arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately, service was exceptional (very sorry I have forgotten our waitress's name as she was attentive and ad a great personality), food and drinks came at the right pace.  Prices were reasonable for the great baseball top steak and double cut, house cut pork chop.  Very pleased and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place! I have been here a few times and will continue to come. The drinks are amazing (especially the Queen of the Creek!)! I order the filet with fries. I LOVE THEIR FRIES! My only complaint is that I always order my filet medium well, and almost always get it well. It is still very good and I am also not a fan of sending my plate back. However, this will not stop me from returning! One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a friend's birthday and now a huge fan of this place,  great ambiance and excellent service.  Our server, Nick made awesome recommendations and promptly accommodated requests.   I ordered the rib eye steak with Maui marinade and fingerling potatoes,  seriously ate every last bite it was so good that I didn't care how stuffed I was,  and these are HUGE portions.  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib with a loaded potato, seriously could have split this meal,  and it was incredible.   Highly recommend this place,  awesome for date night,  special occasions or something different in a fine dining experience. Definitely will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere, menu selection was good. Artichoke appetizer was over cooked as well as the Filet. Kids menu portions were great and service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I/we have eaten at the Chop several times in the past year and any time we sit elsewhere besides sitting at the bar, our service has been horrible. I hate asking the waiter/waitress to refill my water or coffee cup over and over again, especially when the restaurant is charging you $12.00 for a martini. On a positive side, historically the food has always been excellent. Last night after sharing a few appetizers, my wife and I shared a fresh sea bass dinner for $29.50, which was very tasty. However, for $29.50 (which I thought was priced high to begin with) you would think the total size of the serving would be larger then about 4-5 ounces. I believe our days of dinning at the Chop has come to a halt."}
{"text":"We experienced insulting service AND mediocre food.  I am embarrassed every time I think about our dinner there.***We were treating clients to dinner, so before we were even seated we gave the hostess our card and asked for the bill to be charged to our card and given to us at the end of the night***this is an important detail to what's coming.  Throughout the meal, the service was so slow it was as if we were being ignored.  We'd ask for things, refills, missing sides, dessert menu, creamer for our coffee, etc. and they would never come.  We'd have to keep asking for the same things, even though the restaurant was not overly busy.  Our waiter got annoyed when we asked for the table to be leveled because drinks were spilling. Later he was annoyed when we made an inquiry regarding changes to the wine list.  When the meal finally ended, a large bill came and had been charged to our card as we requested. Since we were treating our clients, we did not spend much time reviewing the many changes to avoid any awkwardness.  We added a 20%+ tip and eventually left the restaurant.  While getting into our vehicle, we heard another waiter of ours yelling for our clients to not leave the parking lot until they paid their bill.  We quickly waved the waiter over to us to spare our poor clients further embarrassment, whereupon he started yelling across the parking lot to us instead of just stepping off the sidewalk and having a normal conversation about whatever confusion they were having internally.  At first, the waiter claimed we walked out without paying. This is the same waiter who brought us our bill that was already charged to our card.  After long disputes between waiters and staff, with no apologies for the inconvenience or being accused of ditching our bill, and our clients awkwardly leaving somewhere in the middle of all this, it was discovered that another table's bill was charged to our card in error- their error of course!  When they re-ran the correct bill on our card, we left NO TIP because the entire night had been such a nightmare and still no one had the courtesy to apologize or at least stop acting as if we did something wrong.  I just reviewed our monthly statement and those jokers took it upon themselves to add a tip to the new receipt!!!! They took the tip that we so generously gave (because it was not earned) on the original receipt, before we were chased down and accused of ditching our bill etc., and added it to the new receipt!!!!!!!  This is such fraud and they should have known exactly why we chose not to tip the second time around & been understanding about that.  It was such disgraceful service and highly unethical to make any changes to a signed receipt.  There were so many other things I could complain about, but this is more phone typing than I like to do.  It's also my first review!"}
{"text":"Nice date restaurant, dark but that gives the impression of cooler which I'll take in Arizona ;)  Excellent wine and cocktails, wonderful service, awesome Happy Hour specials-even on weekends. My husband loved his steak, and my sea bass was excellent. Must get the grilled artichoke. Must.      Will be back, the perfect date night restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner recently and had an excellent experience.  The staff is very accommodating.  Manager Bernie greeted us and ensured our experience throughout the evening was relaxing, enjoyable and that our expectations were met.    The cuisine was delicious. Definitely recommend!   Thank you Chop!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, food is too delicious to describe and the ambiance is so great, whether you want a bar set up, a large group set up, or just an intimate set, CHOP has it ALL!!! Please say hi to Jill for me!!!   Just Celebrated wife's \"double nickel\" birthday and everything was INCREDIBLE. Service, appetizers main course and drinks.....ALL YOU COULD ASK FOR!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting the restaurant. Their hamburgers are delicious. The service is good. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place (since we usually go to Rock Lobster or Sauce Pizza & Wine which is in the same location), but I have to tell you; What a fantastic experience!!   Entrance/Drink: We made reservations for 4pm on Sunday evening. We were greeted immediately by the hostess....but decided to sit at the bar. Very posh, dim but romantic place. We had the pleasure of having Jeff be our barkeep for the evening, and he was AWESOME. Asked about Jeff's drink special of the evening, and even offered to let me sample the EG Vodka (original and Rosemary/Lavender) which was so smooth and delicious. I decided to order the drink special and it was great. If you are a vodka drinker...I highly recommend. He was very knowledgable with the brand as well.   Entrees: My wife ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast (lemon Rosemary marinade) and the spaghetti squash as her side. I ordered the Bacon Blue (Arugula Bacon Danish Bleu Cheese) added caramelized onions and added the Mac and Cheese side dish. Everything was really delicious with great flavor.  Pretty much the best Mac and Cheese I have had EVER, and the burger was the second best I have had (after Gordon Ramsey's BURGR in Vegas).   Dessert: Pecan torte is what we ordered. It was the perfect ending for a perfect meal. So delicious. Jeff had recommended the bread pudding for next time, which he said is even better than the pecan torte.   Bonus: Every time we were done with a dish, the hostess (or another waitress) would IMMEDIATELY grab the dirty plate if Jeff was busy making drinks. Service was immaculate. They were definitely on top of their game.   This is definitely my new favorite spot, and they have Happy Hour daily from 4-6pm.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service from the minute you walk in the door! Hostesses are great, happy hour daily including weekends, really???? The chefs are amazing, we come for steaks that o couldn'make at home same with the cocktails! Best place in chandler!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all, kind of dark inside...would make for a solid date place.  A bit overpriced but the meals are large.  Only downside was the side dishes, you only get one choice then it's al la cart for $5 a piece.  Around the table we had the salmon and trout, both good.  The ribeye was unique with a pineapple/citrus flavor, I liked it.  Ordered a kiltlifter and was only chared $2.50 so that was awesome, for not even sitting at the bar.  Would go to this place atleast once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Just ate here when nephew and wife were in town.  We all ate something different.  I had the pork chop.  It was amazing.  Service was excellent.  Wife and I have eaten here several times.  Don't know why I have not reviewed before.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a groupon the other day.  I haven't tried many of the places in this plaza so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has kind of a intimate atmosphere; not too big with a bar right in the middle with low lights.  I see why they call it a Steak Bar.  They had some nice specials during the week like 50% off bottles of wine on Wednesday, which was a nice change.  I got the marinated rib-eye which delicious.  I never order marinated steaks either, but I figured I'd try something different for once.  The flavor was very nice and the steak had a great char on it and was cooked exactly how I ordered it.  The baked potato was also good and nice that you didn't have to pay for ala carte sides.  The GF got the sliced sirloin steak which was also very good.  Oddly, they really didn't ask how she wanted it done and it was on the rarer side of medium.  I thought that was interesting so I figured I'd warn people.  But really, I shouldn't have to, if you're thinking maybe you want it well done, DERP!  I cook a lot of steaks and when people want them over cooked and then complain about them being tough it makes me  crazy.  Back on topic, we ordered some potato popper things that were awesome for an appetizer.  I would definitely go back to this place again.  It is a nice spot in Chandler that's not really low end or crazy expensive.  I'd definitely go here again over Fleming's."}
{"text":"The food and waitstaff were awesome. I made a reservation for a Sunday night and it was a little crowded when we arrived at 6:30. We went for a birthday and they gave us a complementary dessert of our choice. I had the salmon and spaghetti squash and the person I dined with had the boneless rib eye steak that he said was cooked perfectly. I would totally recommend this place of your wanting a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great dining experience! Order the Power Greens Salad with Grilled Salmon. The Bang Bang Shrimp is also excellent! Service is excellent. Great wine options."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I have had!  The service was excellent.  The Manager Jill went out of her way to make sure we had a great meal.  I fly down here a lot with fellow pilot Rick and I will make sure we come back for another great meal!  If you want a great meal this is the place."}
{"text":"The brined pork chop, appropriately called, \"The Pork Chop\", is definitely worth trying. And then we got the peanutbutter cheesecake... That was awesome too.  I thought my green chili burger was dry, but everyone else enjoyed their meal.  Service was great and we enjoyed the cocktails and martinis. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"We could not have been happier with choosing CHoP for my mother's birthday celebration last night! I had reserved a large corner booth for the eight of us, which was ready and waiting when we got there. For the next two hours Chris and his staff doted on us! All of us loved our meals especially the wedge salad, the burgers, and the salmon. Make sure you leave room for the toffee bread pudding! It was delicious! The servers were all so friendly and attentive.  Thank you for making our night special! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Server was nice. Restaurant not busy. She was VERY slow and not attentive. Appetizers came out before the drinks.  Then after finishing appetizers and waiting around had to ask for our server to order dinner. After finishing dinner and clearing our plates waited 30 minutes for our bill! Bill was wrong, double charged for an item. Then charged for something we didn't order. Food was average at best. We spent over 2 hours on a Wednesday night. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had the ribs with a baked potato and the  steak frites with French fries.  Everything was super delicious. Service was perfect - quick and perfect recommendations!!!"}
{"text":"Waited 15-20 minutes at the bar when bartender knew I wanted service told another staff member at the food window to help me. Waited another 5-10 and staff member never came over. Left for The Keg, I've always had excellent service there it was just a little farther to drive should've went there in the first place"}
{"text":"I have yet to try a dish here that I don't love! The thick cut pork chop with apple chutney is cooked to perfection and is by far my favorite dish.  If pork isn't your thing, the prime rib or lobster ravioli are top notch!"}
{"text":"Well, I will say I was impressed by the outside of the building.. (I noticed the outside so carefully because I was standing outside as I was actively being stood up on a date). It looks like a place where the food should be decent if not good. I figured I deserved a meal anyway..  Well I order the salmon w a baked potato & a side of mushrooms.. The mushrooms were horrible. The potato was hard and cold. I ordered a new potato and it's ok.. Not much flavor. Just a bunch of sh** dumped into a potato. The salmon was passable, tho I'd never order it again from here. It was a Friday and busy; but if u can't handle the quantity, u need to have less seating.   Not worth the $$ .. I'll maybe come back; if someone else is paying for it..   Oh yea, the wine was good. Maybe this is more a drinks place"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The food was amazingly delicious, we both had pork chops and were impressed, however that was their only saving grace with the 2 stars.  The service was terrible. First off, the pour on my wine was that of a taster. just barely 3 fingers full, for the price i expect a little more. Our server was constantly walking past us, with our empty glasses on the edge of the table, and still we had to stop her each time we needed to order a new drink. Again, for the price you pay to eat here I would expect a better service experience.  Not sure what was up, whether it was the bar-tender or the server but it would take 15mins just to get our ordered drink, and even then we had to ask her why it hasn't arrived yet. Sad to say she could have made much more on us as a table had she paid more attention, we likely would have gone thru 3-4 drinks each instead of only 1-2.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay not sure how I want to write this, because I flat out didn't enjoy this from just after we were seated. 1. Salad I had was good! (No Bread); ordered my steak med rare it was more toward rare the and charred on the outside and was tough to cut. Light was way low couldn't really see what I was eating. Then the Noise level way to much not ideal for a group. Not even for two.  I didn't feel like the service, the food, or the atmosphere (noise) were equal to the mood set by the decor!! Not saying the people weren't nice because they were."}
{"text":"Chop is like a really pretty girl who is an airhead that can't hold a conversation with you.  You can only admire the beauty for a few minutes before being driven away by the flaws.  Chop is a nice looking restaurant. A nice bar, sleek booths, a sharp decor, and a good looking staff all get your attention before taking your seat. And that's where the good stuff ends.  The menu is rather boring but that shouldn't be a problem as long as the execution is good. Well, the food here is really bad.  Like, really bad.  I've been multiple times hoping to finally find something they do great but, alas, there isn't anything. Meats are dry and boring (trying brining those pork chops guys!) and some of the items are so poorly conceived they are disgusting. For example, the spaghetti squash was prepared with a ton of capers.  I love capers but this was so bad it rendered everything else on the plate inedible. Capers and squash- the dynamic duo. But that's what you get here; a nice decor and a miserable effort by the kitchen."}
{"text":"The Monday night prime rib special ($19.95) SOUNDED like a good idea.  We set forth to discover this new neighborhood restaurant with high hopes.  The restaurant itself is attractive, if dim.  It was hard to read the menu without using our cell phones as flashlights.  The hostess made a good first impression; the chairs in our corner table were comfortable and ample.  But the place was so dimly lit, I couldn't tell if \"medium rare\" was more rare than raw.  One taste and I knew for sure it was very salty.  Ditto for the au jus.  Even my husband who salts with impunity thought it was salty, so there you go.  His loaded baked potato was cold on delivery.  It was only slightly warmer on its second trip.  As for service, we barely saw our waiter.  No water refills, although the restaurant was practically empty.  I appreciated being able to substitute broccoli for the baked potato, but the promised Parmesan-lemon topping was so scarce as to be indiscernible.  The raucous music selections did not seem to jibe with the sedate atmosphere.  Sadly, I don't think we will be revisiting CHoP.  Hard to erase a bad first impression.  ."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner!  Rib Eye was perfect and the loaded baked potato was so good, I ate the entire thing...skin and all.  My wife loved her burger and the Toffee Bread Pudding was to die for.  Our waitress Monica was great, friendly and attentive, made for an enjoyable evening out.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed! A groupon got us here, and we will be back. We arrived around 5:15, wanted to do an early dinner & avoid crowd on Friday evening, made reservations.  I had scallops - my husband had the prime rib. They were both excellent. The Bleu cheese dressing was of the best I have had. The special dessert for the evening was key lime pie and it was fabulous!  My only disappointment was the Server was not very friendly - almost condescending, however she did have all to us in a timely manner and was efficient. More of an adult atmosphere, wouldn't recommend children."}
{"text":"I loved there food and service.  My fiance and I came here for a dinner together, and of course pick a night where the majority of the place was booked by a party, however we did get to sit down and eat in a really nice area.  I ordered the steak (marinated) and sweet potato frys and I tell you the steak was to die for!  Very delicious, will return again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was my wife's treat to me for my birthday! She picked this place because I love a good steak house!  So for starters this place gets four stars because the food is worth every penny.....  The restaurant is clean. Bathrooms are clean. The entrance is very dark when you walk in with one hostess stand! The hostess is very nice and welcoming...  The food like I said was on par with the price. I ordered the filet mignon with the chop fries.( they were awesome.)  Also ordered a side of sautéed spinach. It was one of the specials.  The meat was cooked perfectly and so were the sides!  The appetizer was chicken satay with peanut dipping sauce. Awesome as well.   My wife and I are foodies and love to eat out at nice places and try new ones we also know what good service is since we have been around the block a few times with the restaurant business!   The four stars is totally for the food!!!   The service could be so much better and so much more organized..  I had to wait for certain things and also had to grab the waiters attention just to get service witch I should not have had to do with the price of the food!  It seems as though the staffing is just not there although the bar seemed over staffed to me.  Perhaps this restaurant makes more money from the bar then it does the food side. Which is a shame because they have an amazing menu and all the items we ordered were perfectly executed!  Well done to the kitchen staff!!!!  The pecan torte was delicious! Said the wife !  She's tough to get approval from being a pastry chief herself !!! So great job with dessert too guys!   We will definitely be back here as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Chop on a Tuesday night, kind of late. The head chef greeted us and recommended a few things on the menu. The ambiance is awesome. I ordered the last order of lamb chops and my husband ordered the famous pork CHOP. They were both delicious and perfectly cooked. Our server was attentive and responded pleasantly to our requests. When we were ready to pay the bill, the server brought over two spoons - we looked at her puzzled and she said \"the chef would like to buy your dessert!\" To our surprise we received a beautiful piece of key lime pie - I was not a fan of key lime pie before, but I AM NOW! Yum!! We ate the whole thing. Great spot in little DT Ocotillo. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Chop last night.  Here's a general overview:  1. The good - ambiance was great, bar was cool, services was attentive, tolerated my two young kids - probably too young to have taken there. My wife ordered braised short ribs, they were fantastic.  2. The bad - I ordered mahi mahi.  I thought it very bland.  I had lunch at Capital Grille this afternoon and ordered their halibut.  The difference between Capital Grille and  Chop was night and day.   I'd go back, but for the price I though the food was just decent. Certainly wouldn't recommend ordering the mahi mahi"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. A friend recommended it a month ago. My husband and I went on a Saturday evening. We both had fish, 2 sides and a bottle of wine and the food and service were excellent. I went for dinner tonight with the friend who had recommended it originally. Horrible experience from the moment we walked in until we left. Our reservations were for 6:45. At 7:25 they finally seated us at a 6-person booth in the corner. We waited 40 minutes and they did not apologize for the wait, offer to buy us drinks or an appetizer. Neither of us were in mood for a steak, so my friend ordered the chicken breast and I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka sauce and a side salad. Her chicken breast was dry and looked like a charcoal briquette. My lobster ravioli was dry and there was only a hint of sauce (pink tint on the plate). When the waitress inquired as to our meals, I said the ravioli was bit dry and could I get some extra sauce? She brought me marinara and never came back to check on me. My entree did not include marinara sauce. Did she not recognize what I had ordered? My friend could not eat her dry chicken, but I was so hungry I slathered my ravioli in marinara and choked it down. Then we waited for our check. The busboy took our plates and asked me how my meal was. I said not so good. He said \"Well, you should know better than to order spaghetti at a chop house\". Really? They don't have spaghetti on the menu and if you offer lobster ravioli for $24 on your menu with no side, then it should be edible. If a customer tells you their meal sucks, perhaps you should tell the manager so they can make it right!  If the only thing you do right is a steak, then you should only sell steak.  No thanks, we would not like any dessert.  Please put us out of our misery. We had to flag down our waitress (who never offered her name or checked on us more than once the entire meal) for the check and could not get out of there fast enough. Neither of us will return."}
{"text":"The service and quality of this establishment is hit or miss, the bartenders are great especially Jeff but last night when a steak is ordered medium rare and served medium plus don't patronize me and give me a 20% off your next meal, make it right, you have one thing to do well as a steakhouse and it's cook the steak perfectly! The manager had the nerve to say I cut through the steak and it's off just a hair, I think medium rare and medium plus Is more than just a hair off. They can't seem to get this right! If I have to send a steak back that I'm paying $40 for, would prefer not to eat alone while you try and re-cook it and then give me a coupon to come back, honestly ridiculous and not the definition of customer service for a high-priced steakhouse!"}
{"text":"i have been anxious to try this place and I did but sadly I was underwhelmed. I ordered the steak salad, the steak was very chewy, the salad had primarily iceberg lettuce.. really?? and a few cherry tomatoes. Very disappointing for the price.   Go to Flemings... Who serves iceberg lettuce and if the steak was a disappointment what do you order"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly which is great! Except our booth was basically a table for 1. It felt like they just threw another hair there. My husband felt awkward the entire time while dining. Food was good but we probably won't go back for that."}
{"text":"So glad we purchased a groupon here to try it out. Upon arriving we waited 10 minutes at our table before asking a busser to see who our waitress was supposed to be.   It seemed 5 different people took care of us, which in some restaurants is called teamwork, here it was disarray.   The tables were so close in their side room that we felt like we were sharing conversations with people we didn't know. Also, our steaks, while cooked to order, lacked flavor.  On the good end, we loved the setting. The decorations and mood was nice. The fries were good, the seasonal beer was great (3 dollar draft at happy hour) and the baked potato was outstanding.  We probably won't be back, but it'd be worth trying if you find the right deal or like their menu options. My hope would be that our service experience was an outlier."}
{"text":"We visited with a group of 6 people and were greeted when we first walked in by 3 of the staff.  We ordered a bottle of white wine, and as another reviewer wrote, they did not chill the wine on the table, and they should have.  We ordered two appetizers, smoked salmon and calamari.  I asked the waitress if the calamari was the \"circle kind\" or if it was all \"squid bodies\".  She said they were the circle kind and no squid bodies, but when the appetizer came, there were many squid bodies and only a few circles, and the portion was small.  The smoked salmon came out after our food, and wasn't my favorite, although it is supposed to be pretty good.  The waitress did apologize for the appetizer coming out after the food.  I ordered the chicken paillard, which was very good, and a nice portion size.  Others at the table ordered Steak Frites, which was extremely small portion, but tasted good and was loaded with french fries.  The steak was like a steak appetizer, and we could've gone to McDonald's after dinner.  Another ordered the steak and baked potato, and his steak was small as well.  For dessert, I had the pecan trifle with ice cream, which was very tasty as well.  I believe the food was overpriced for what you ended up getting. This would be a great place to just go and have drinks and appetizers, and not ordered any entree.  It is extremely dark inside the restaurant, which I found sort of odd.  The staff was friendly.  They need to work on their portion sizes in contrast to their prices.  We dropped $100 (incl tip) between my husband and I and so did the other 2 couples that were with us, and food portions lacking."}
{"text":"My husband and I showed up precisely at 6:45 for out 6:45 reservation and were informed that they were running behind on reservations. Not a big deal. The hostess lets us know that only one couple is ahead of us anyway. A couple comes in as we are stepping aside to wait. We heard them get told about the wait as well and they also stepped aside to the area we were in to wait. At about 7 a couple from the bar is called and taken back to a table. 5-10 minutes later, the couple that came in AFTER us is called and taken to a table. We were finally seated about 5 minutes after they were.  Once we were seated the service was so so. Our server was very nice but seemed to disappear at times.  Most of the food was fairly good. The spinach and artichoke dip was very plain with almost no taste. Onion rings were a bit greasy. Definite 2 star experience. We had tickets to see a movie at 8:30 which we had to cancel because of the amount of time we spent there. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times for a date night with my wife.  The first time was awesome and I would have rated 5 stars.  The second time was subpar and would have rated 2 stars.  The pros are the ambiance, price, and service. The cons are the food.  On our first visit we loved everything.  The food and service were on point.  The second visit was this weekend.  The bar service was ok at best.  The bartenders were friendly but they seemed swamped and couldn't handle the crowd quickly enough.  At dinner, I ordered the crab cake appetizer and had to return it.  IT was like cat food smothered with mayo.  My wife had the shrimp cocktail which was awesome.  We both ordered the filet mignon entree.  My wife ordered plain and I asked for mine blackened.  Hers was delish but mine was like sticking my tongue in a salt shaker.  The quality of the meat was good and the cook was perfect, but the seasoning, oh my god, I have never had something so salty, and I like salt.  The waitress and hostess were great.  Unfortunately the crab cakes were left on the bill and I had to ask to have it removed and it was.     I will be back and I do like this place and this review is nothing more than constructive criticism for a restaurant that I do like.  The ambiance was great and I wish there were more places like this in the east valley.  But, they need to step up their food game a bit."}
{"text":"Another great burger night special.  Tuesday and Sunday from 4 to 6.  We love the veggie burgers but any 2 burgers and a bottle of wine from a select list only $29.  The Concannon Syrah is our usual and we always add the grilled broccolini when available.  Fantastic side. Kudos to Matt for the great and personable service."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak salad to go was given a 20 to 30 minute Waite time. I showed up 30 minutes after it should have been done to find out they no longer can make that salad. I picked a different salad the price was twice as expensive and was told it would be another 10 minutes. If I were you I would not give a company who provides this type of service your money. For a salad I was charged 28.11 considering I help business such as there's get started I can see why we would never lend to them. I recommend taking your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with brother while in town for work.    Great \"live\" atmosphere. Had to wait about 20 minutes for table, but were well kept at the bar area high top tables.  Had a round of drinks and without requesting, the manager comped is a second round due to the wait.  The bar table was comfortable, sober just ended up having a fantastic steak dinner with the best loaded baked potato I have had in years!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely amazing and the service was as well.  I would recommend this place for happy hour or dinner.  Very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at Chop for the last few years and it's one of our favorite spots in Chandler. We typically start with their spinach dip and then move onto their homemade veggie burger with awesome fries and the chimichurri steak salad.  Their service is top notch and we love the ambience. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the service was really off. Sat the bar and was invisible for about 15 min. Sat for dinner drinks were immediately served  but server was not present for 15 min.  Finished meal 15 min before we got the check. Dinner came slow but was amazing. Have been here several times. Seems like an off customer server night.  Will be come back but hope this was just an off night."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Husband and I finally were able to get a date night.Sat at the table for over 10 minutes waiting for a server. Finally decided to move from the table to the bar since we weren't going to get any service. We asked the bartender what was good here and he went in to say, they added the burgers about a few weeks ago and he didn't agree with it. He didn't really point out anything that they were known for. After the poor description of the menu and lack of service, we decided to just get up and leave. As we walked out, I then asked the host why we never received a server, she then went on and said that they were short staffed. Awesome. Wont be doing this train wreck again"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place on the aesthetics alone, it would be an enthusiastic five stars. You would not expect to find someplace this cool in a suburban strip mall. The interior looked sleek and modern with a lot of dark hardwood and smooth and shiny bartop/tabletops and huge mirrors on the walls. The booths and tables were all leather and although they looked minimalist in design were actually very comfortable. The dim lighting added to the ambiance and was very cool looking: some neutral toned boxy Chinese lantern style lights above the tables, huge dome lights that seemed to be made from some kind of found objects from the early industrial age, and really snazzy back lighting at the bar area that up-lit the liquor bottles in a really cool way and highlighted the exposed (but tastefully painted black) pipes and duct work running across the ceiling. The best part was they played some really awesome music for us to enjoy while we ate our meal. No annoying pop songs or boring elevator music, their soundtrack could have been straight from Sirius satellite radio's AltNation station (which is the coolest radio station on the planet). Also, it didn't hurt that the bartenders and servers were all young and cute. Although, ours was not particularly good at her job and none of them stirred an inch when we walked in the door until after we had been standing there uncertainly for about 10 minutes.  The food was tasty, but not good enough to justify the bill. We spent $120 for the hubby and I but the food was just ok. They seemed to be pricing themselves at the level of an upscale steakhouse... but they aren't. My husband ordered the $38 NY strip and said that it tasted pretty much the same as the steak we usually make at home. I ordered the Maui ribeye for $30. After the waitress had described what was in the marinade, I expected many levels of flavor from the ginger and various other elements but really all I tasted was the pineapple, especially on the seared outside where the juice had carmelized. I am sure there are people out there who may like an overly sweet steak but not me. The choices for side dishes were boring and unoriginal... various permutations of the potato, sauteed veggies, etc. The only one that sounded interesting was the barley salad but I did not think that would go well with steak so I ordered the sweet potato fries and he got the regular fries. We both agreed we'd had better fries at a fast food restaurant. The best part of the meal was the potato soup which was very flavorful but also a little too rich and wasn't nearly as hot as it should have been when it was served to us. For the dessert we got the lemon zest creme brulee which was basically just creme brulee (I could not detect any tartness in it whatsoever).  The plus side is that they have a pretty good beer list and those were all reasonably priced ($4 or $5). I think we would come back for a light supper (they did have some burgers on the menu for only $12) or happy hour. Unfortunately, their wine was also drastically overpriced with glasses from $7 to $14 for very low-end wines that would retail around $8-15 a bottle; but from 4-6 pm daily those would have been $5 as well so thats a good thing. It's too bad they are so greedily trying to price gouge the wealthy Ocotillo residents; otherwise this would have likely become our new favorite place for a nice steak dinner but with The Keg just up the road why would you spend more for an inferior meal?"}
{"text":"The food was great - I ordered a wedge salad and the Cajun ahi tuna; both were really good. Judy had crab cakes which were good as well. Beer: mudshark IPA was okay - not as \"hoppy\" as we like our IPA's. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars was the service... We sat AT THE BAR and I had to wait literally 5-6 minutes with an empty beer while the bartenders talked to wait staff and each other. If I'm sitting at the bar I shouldn't have to wait for a beer when my glass is empty... I LITERALLY turned our beer glasses UPSIDE DOWN to get the bartenders attention that we needed a refill - or at least ask us if we want another. Could've been much better..."}
{"text":"What a bummer! I was so excited for Chop. The atmosphere is great, but the food was horrible. I ordered the filet, medium rare, with broccoli. Each bite of my steak tasted like charcoal. I don't like my filet crunchy.. Do you? I'm not even sure that the broccoli was cooked. Crunchy as well. My fiancé got ribs which were black. Someone came up to the table and grabbed my plate full of food to discard. Didn't even bother to ask me if it tasted ok. I had high hopes for Chop. I love supporting local business, but this place unfortunately isn't worth your time or money."}
{"text":"We arrived for dinner on a Saturday evening. We made a reservation for a party of 3. Upon arrival, our table wasn't ready. We waited about 10 minutes.. Not too bad. They sat us in the back where there was a large party with children. It was loud and not pleasant. I ordered a filet which in turn wasn't prepared as ordered. In fact, I sent it back twice. Another person in my group attempted to order Prime rib only to be informed after he ordered it that they were out. Poor management to run out of Prime rib at 8pm on a Saturday night at a Steak house. Our salads were drenched in dressing.. Sent those back too. Our waitress was kind and friendly.. She was the only save for this restaurant . Poor service on behalf of their preparation, menu, and overall management. The prices are that of Flemings.. I will not return to this establishment or recommend it."}
{"text":"So pleased to have a place in Chandler that is somewhat hip. So, thank you for that. The food is nice, the atmosphere is great, and the wait staff is attentive. We have been twice to dine and ordered take out as well. The only item I have not enjoyed was the Asian Chicken Salad--pretty bland.   But...my husband raves about the ribs, and the steak is really nice, flavorful and prepared well."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Chop, so naturally it was on our list of places to visit during Arizona Restaurant Week. Per usual, this restaurant delivered! Not only do you get a gourmet three-course meal at an affordable price, but the $40 per person price tag also includes a glass of wine. Free booze??? I'm in!!! I got the sirloin and my husband got the pork chop. Everything was good. I highly recommend the pecan torte for dessert. The combination of nuts, caramel, pastry crust, and ice cream is divine."}
{"text":"Every time I visit they find a way to exceed my expectations. Great food, service and atmosphere. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ok, slow to learn!  Food is Bonanza grade, at Flemmings prices.  If you can get to the bar seat due to all the drunk Chop investors and their posse, you might get a drink, just a bunch of assholes drinking for free and they treat the real customers like shit.  If you really want a good steak, chops or fish I really suggest you go to DC Steakhouse in down town chandler.  Very good prices and excellent food.  I would stay away from Chop, looks nice but that is as far as it goes"}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for CHop and thought to give it a try,  convenient to our home, we made resevations for Saturday night at 7:30 for a party of 3. The restaurant's decor was very nice, typical steak house trendy. We were greeted and sat promptly. The restaurant was filled and very loud. Our waiter was very attentive, came over and greeted us, took our drink orders, and told us all the specials. May I mention the oddness of no table setup (no napkins or utensils) and no warm bread. OK, moving on, we ordered the Beef Carpaccio w/Arugula and Capers @ $12, Chimichuri Steak Salad w/Field Greens, Vinaigrette, Bleu Cheese @ $14.5, Steak Frites w/Au Jus, Chop Fries @ $18.5, and a Bone-In NY Strip w/Seasonal Vegetables @ $38. All our food was perfectly cooked to the request. All the food tasted good. Were we blown away? no! What we were blown away with was the price to portions. The Bone-In NY Strip small though done perfectly had very little seasoning. The steak salad meat portion was the same for the steak frites 4 small slices of flat iron steak (maybe 4oz.) that was it! We frequent BLT, Morton's, and Fleming's. We'll stick with BLT with it amazing view, unbelieveable popovers and complimentary appetizer and dessert goodies and their Bone-In NY Strip with a choice of sauces if you like at $43. If CHop wants to play in the sandbox with the big boys then they really should step up their game."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for my husband and I, and in fact we just went there again last Friday. It's great for date night or friendly get togethers. Chop has a great ambience regardless who you're dining with. We have always had great service here and the wait staff is super friendly and very knowledgable with both food and drinks. My only suggestion would be to make a reservation if you're going on a Friday or Saturday as it can get pretty busy there.   Okay, I lied... I have another suggestion..... Super food salad and the prime rib with creamy horseradish. My absolute fave"}
{"text":"These guys saved us on a special day. Every restaurant we went to for our anniversary date closed early despite us calling ahead. Stumbled across CHoP and wow. Service and food was stellar. Great wine  and  on tap. My prime rib was awesomeness and Marcys filled Cajun salmon was dynamite!  Thx for the great service and for saving our 24 annual first date."}
{"text":"Awesome place, we really liked the ambiance, warm and inviting. The aromas upon entering are fantastic! The artichoke appetizer was plentiful and tasty. The pork chop was juicy and very thick. The service was a little off but they've only been two weeks so I'm sure they will fix."}
{"text":"Cool look. Warm welcome. Great vibe. This is all before the food is served. The menu isn't complicated. Great choices. Mini Cesesr salad, steakhouse linguini and meatballs. Everything is housemate. Hubby ordered The Pork Chop. Signature dish works well. Let's eat!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my meal. I ordered the salmon upon recommendation from the server. Portion was very small and over cooked. Mashed potatoes were were very cheesy which I was not expecting.  Service was fine, food came extremely fast.  Overall it was just ok.  Based on cost and the quality of the meal I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am moving to Ocotillo so I was really really really hoping the CHoP was great. I wanted a nearby steak place that we could love. So far CHoP underperformed.   We called ahead for reservations. When we arrived on time, there were no seats available so we were allowed to sit at the bar and order drinks. 45 minutes later still no seats so we just ordered food at the bar. The bartender was very nice, and the drinks tasted great.   Finally we took our seats an hour after arrival at the same time our food arrived. The Maui Rib Eye tasted great, but not incredible. We saw our waitress once. My wife ordered a salad which was pretty good. For what it is the price is pretty high; they are trying to be a middle-high end place without the service or experience to match. With incredible service, the food would cut it. But as it is, based on our experience, acceptable food with unacceptable service, means that without a groupon, we probably won't be back  Despite not having seats for our reservation and despite having to order food at the bar and then move to a table we did not even get an \"I'm sorry\" or what would seem like a near obligatory drink or appetizer on the house for such a mistake.   I hope that this was just a one-time bad experience. We will probably give them another chance...but only cause we live close.  UPDATE: we've been back a few more times with better service. I'm upping the review from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here with great friends to enjoy a nice quiet evening..  Where do I start?  Waited only 5 minutes for our water.  Asked for lemon wedges and bread and butter.  Lemon wedges came out 5 more minutes later. Still no bread & butter.  Server took the order for drinks.  Wine by the glass was ordered. 10 minutes later wine was served. Appy's were then ordered.  Asked if the bread was still in the oven?  10 more minutes and the appy's were being served, however, we had to ask for utensils and napkins. Asked for bread again.  Server finally went into the kitchen & brought out the bread & butter.  The bread came out with grease marks from the grill & hard as a rock!  Steaks & sides were served. Some prepared properly, others not.  Cole slaw was served to my wife.  It was a good thing she was not allergic to nuts or bacon which were not indicated on the menu.  Deserts were ok.  We asked if the decaf coffee was fresh and the server indicted it was two hours old.  We asked if they could make a fresh pot.  He said he asked the manager and was told NO!  Really?? Upon paying the check I discussed this situation with the manager Jill.  She apologized and said no one asked her about the coffee. She gave us two $50 gift certificates to return. A great gesture, but just not for me.  The check for four should have been picked up by her along with the apology.  Myself and my guests frequent Fleming's along with other steakhouses.  This would have never occurred at there establishments.  Oh, as far as the quiet evening, heavy metal back round music, I don't think so!"}
{"text":"Very good local spot.  The atmosphere is great and the food is fantastic.  Based on simular places CHOP is average price but we like going as they always have specials and the service is second to none."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and some were similar if not spot on.  I went here for my Birthday (Mid February) The ambiance was great and fortunately for us the company was even better. The decor and feel of the restaurant is awesome and what I'm looking for in a quality chop house.  The service was good however, like Tanya's review our waiter didn't know anything about the wine.  Unfortunately, the food didn't hold up to what I hoped it would be.  I got the Pork Chop.  It was a solid piece of meat however it was dry and lacked the flavor I was hoping for.  Additionally, my baked potato was not fully cooked and I couldn't eat it?  My wife got the chicken which she was happy with but her side of mac n cheese was super dry as well.  The company we were with got the fillet.  It was OK but for $38 I was expecting it to be great.  Ive had better steaks for a lot less.  Anyhow, I was really hoping it would be great but the food was well below expectations.  Very doubtful Ill go back, Id rather go to Flemings or Houston's."}
{"text":"The food is good, but over priced and the service is awful. 45 minutes to get a burger and then the order was wrong! Three strikes on this one. Not coming back."}
{"text":"One of our go-to \"special occasion\" restaurants or where we take out of town guests for a great time. The food and service is always great...haven't had a bad meal in the 5 years we have been coming here. The NY and Rib Eye steaks are up there in quality with Steak 44. As expected, we came here for our anniversary dinner last night and two observations struck us as odd. We notice a little boy (probably around 11 years old), go behind the bar and into the kitchen. All the staff seemed to know who he was...owners kid, perhaps? The other SMH moment was seeing one of servers polish off the last couple swigs of hooch behind the counter...straight out of the bottle! This is why I always make my own doggie bag...I'm afraid I might have extra teeth marks in my steak. Other than that, a great experience like always! We'll see what shenanigans we experience during our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went to try chop for fathers day and while the food was amazing the service was lacking. Dinner started off good and the service was pretty decent, but as the night went on and the place died down so did the service and attention. My boyfriend ordered a second glass of wine before our food even came and he didn't get it till after we were finished eating. My father in law ordered a 16 oz prime rib. When he put in the order he asked for horseradish to come out with his order because it always gets forgotten. The waitress brought his food sans the horseradish at which point he asked for it again. By the time he got it he was almost half way done with his prime rib. Not to mention he took a 5 minute break in between eating it specifically because he wanted the horseradish to eat it with.  We had a late dinner that night so couldn't even blame the staff for being too busy to take care of us. Water was brought when we initially sat down, but not once did someone come by to ask if we wanted a refill. It wasn't till my boyfriend stole my water near the end of the meal that I decided to get up and ask someone to bring us over water which of course they did right away. Same thing with the check we had to get up and ask for it as well as get up and give it to someone to take care of. It wasn't like we were in a rush at any of the given moments--we just literally sat waiting that long before finally taking action ourselves. The staff was super friendly, but the girls spent way too much time by the back bar area talking pretty much the entire time we were being ignored. We will probably go back again just for the food alone, but hopefully the service is better improved."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the service lately but haven't posted because the food makes up for it. My husband loves the pork chop so we kept the bad service to ourselves. On our most recent visit his pork chop was delivered raw and cold in most of the center. Sorry but that should have prompted the chef's personal apology or at least the manager's attention. Instead the server took it and brought it back very quickly...oh yeah, still raw. When the server cleared my husband's plate the pork chop was still there and nothing was said. Not cool Chop, not cool."}
{"text":"We went to Chop for the first time last night as a celebration for my husbands new position at work. I want to give it a 5-Star for our service. Our server was perfect and came around at the right time all evening. He made great suggestions for wine and food and was certainly friendly enough. I'm taking away one star for the restaurant being so dark!! I'm not older or need glasses and I certainly enjoy great ambiance but a place so dark where we had to struggle to read the menu was too much!  Upon arriving, we could hardly see anything and even after we let our eyes adjust, we had to use our phone lights to read the menu...My husband's seat happened to face the door to outside and every time the door opened a bright light shone in his face..This should be a sure sign that your lighting difference from inside to outside at 6:30 pm is a bit too stark! I'm also taking the second star away for the price - I felt like for what we got, it's expensive! There was one chicken dish and it's over $20! Seriously - for lemon chicken?! My husband had the prime rib and it was excellent. My daughter and I both ordered the specials - fish options - and they were tasty - but nothing spectacular - Simple grilled fish with a side of flavored butter which was definitely needed. We will probably go again and it was worth it for a special occasion - but this won't be a regular hang out for us...It's too pricey and I don't want to feel like I'm sitting in my bedroom ready to sleep!"}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when I was able to buy a groupon for dinner we decided to try it.  The restaurant itself looks like a huge bar.  I didn't like that the waitress tried to seat us immediately by the door although there were several empty tables.   We ordered fried zucchini for appetizers, a Caesar and wedge salad for starters.  We also ordered the trout and broccoli/cauliflower au gratin and the \"baseball\" sirloin and French fries.  The zucchini was too thinly cut to hold onto the batter and as a result it tasted greasy - the dip wasn't bad.  The plates that they brought out were warm to the touch so that our salads were not as crisp as we usually like.  That being said, they were just ok. The salad dressing was not cold, the lettuce was warm, thought they could have made more of an effort.  The \"wedge\" was a quarter head of ice berg w/bacon and some type of ranch dressing priced at $7.00.  Not very appetizing to look at and did not taste it either.   I was looking forward to a good steak so when my entrée arrived I was a bit taken aback by the size of it - it was really small for a sirloin - it wasn't your usual strip like you would see in a steak restaurant - it was the size of the palm of my hand - I had not ordered a fillet.  That being said, I was hoping that the flavor would make up for it.   I had ordered the steak medium well.  I took one bite and almost choked, I could barely chew it was so over cooked.  This was the worst steak I had ever eaten - anywhere!  Way overcooked!  Awful!  Most chefs that have cooked steak know the differences between medium, medium well and well.  This one did not.  They had also seasoned everything with some kind of spice - the steak, the fries - even my husband's trout had a weird taste to it.  On top of the that a waiter brought my husband potatoes au gratin instead of the vegetable au gratin he had ordered.  Our waiter did not serve us, someone else did and he was wandering around with our plates for each course looking confused as though he didn't know which table had ordered them.  We had to tell him.   The final surprise came when we got the bill, for the amount of food, the quality of the food and given the surroundings I would not have expected the bill to exceed $80.  It was the worse meal we've had in a long time - aside from that, I thought the restaurant had a plastic vibe to it - Ocotillo isn't Scottsdale - this restaurant is overpriced, the food is inferior and we will never go back.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Really do want to like this place because it is within walking distance of our house and has a nice atmosphere for a \"suburban\" steak joint. Service has always been pretty good, but food is really hit or miss. The burgers are over-cooked, and steak and ribs a bit on the dry side. On the 3 occasions we have visited, we have had to remind the server(s)/management of a sauce being requested on the side. We  probably won't go back, but will hope for the best to see better reviews in the future as they iron out some of the issues."}
{"text":"The baby back ribs were superior , great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Umm yum! Christmas Eve dinner was flawless and an awesome first experience at CHoP. Seated immediately for a 6p reservation, served quickly by a friendly waitress.  Ribs are absolutely fantastic. Super tender, no utensils needed, with great flavor. Mac & Cheese is yummy, especially with the bacon!  Had a bite of the ribeye and some CHoP fries, ribeye was tender and juicy while the fries had a great seasoning salt.   Looking forward to another  visit and to trying a burger, though it will be hard to stray from those ribs!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I need to sit in a masculine restaurant. Which lead me to the latest meat lover, bone-in steak or juicy burger dinner house in the southeast Valley. Chop Chandler. There is nothing in AZ like mesquite grillin, a two inch tall cowboy steak or chop.   Chef Charles Osteen, partner of the group that delivered The Living Room, The Sushi Room and Humble Pie, who worked nineteen years for Houston's is continuing the ultimate steakhouse cuisine.   To start, I order Chop a Rita $11. Sauza silver, watermellon, jalapeno. I best describe this drink as the local gal gone wild. My meal, a wonderfully  seared tall chop $23. House cured, double cut with a baker and green apple chutney. A new American presentation.  The Mission Style restaurant reminds me of Santa Barbara's Spanish Colonial Revival, an architecture I love, with tuck 'n roll booths that boasts a warm and very friendly atmosphere. Well done Men."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service way below average. Sunday evening, 7:30. Place is dead. Our server gets off but doesn't tell us or communicate who new server is that is taking over.  Been here at least five times. Always average. People sitting at bar seem to be employees or friends of employees so that is focus of place as opposed to guests."}
{"text":"Chop I love your food and especially your pork chop but I'm super sad you don't have the lobster ravioli any more :(.  Regardless you food is great and well will be back"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and definitely the place for a date/couples night. I was so looking forward to amazing surprises. imagine a dish called \"awesome fries\"... Not as good as the fast food kind. I did like the service although the waiter knew NOTHING about wine. We just wanted a nice fruity wine he should know that, instead we sampled three tart dry wines and he lost out on a nicer tip and that pricey bottle. I had a good night with the company but doubt I will visit again. Maybe they are still new and need some practice? Hopefully they will get it right. With a $250 bill I would rather grill up some great steaks at home. It's worth the try, maybe I came to visit on a bad night?"}
{"text":"Successful experience about half a dozen times now. Consistently good  food and the service is attentive. Our family of 5 has tried everything from steak, salmon, shrimp and pork chops all of which have been really flavorful with nice presentation.   The restaurant has a good vibe and the bar was busy. Good for adults or older children 12+"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great! Really beautiful place. I would recommend this place just for the bar. Wine list is pretty decent, but I would have liked to see a bigger selection of Syrah. Great selection of micro brews.  We came for dinner and had a reservation. I could tell the server was slammed, and we waited a long time after we were seated for someone to get our drink order. It was probably another 15-20 minutes before our server was caught up enough to come to our table to take our order. Not sure if she was the only server on the floor, but I felt bad for her. She was really nice and we could tell she was doing everything she could. Wasn't her fault. Food was just average. Spinach and artichoke dip was very basic... Nothing special about it. The chips served with it were right out of a bag. I had the prime rib for an entree. Again, it was just average. It was gigantic, and although it had good flavor, for some reason it was very tough.  Again, beautiful restaurant and bar. We will go back for drinks, and maybe try some of the burgers. But we won't be back for the prime rib. A little pricey for just an average steak."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  The steak was over cooked, asked for medium and it was medium well,  no pink at all. Had a Groupon tried to use the remainder balance and it was a choir to use 10 dollars.  The waitress didn't explain the problem with the check, dropped it off and ran.  The manager sat at the bar off duty and complained about Sunday's with the bartender.  Overall not satisfied  The only good thing was music"}
{"text":"Mediocre service, served ice cold brocolli, husbands steak was ok, drinks were good, but overall experience and service were not that great!  Unfortunately not impressed!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is sexy, the service was great and the food was really good. My husband and I have both been in the service industry at high end restaurants. Our bartender Chris gave great service, the food came out in good time and our over all experience was great. I agree with some other posts that a newly opened restaurant is going to make some mistakes, but this place has great potential for the long haul."}
{"text":"If you want a raw pork chop and a general manager that doesn't care...then this place is the place to come! After we expressed our concerns to Jill, the general manager, she still didn't follow up to see how our new plate of food turned out. This place is horrible. Go eat at sizzler's it's the equivalent to this place but the check will be less. If I can express my review in 6 words: \"I'm throwing up in my mouth!\""}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review. Chop used to be one of our favorite restaurants. Both the food and the service had been topnotch. Lately that has not been the case and now I've given it several \"second chances\" and I'm afraid tonight was our last visit.  We arrived for an early dinner, were greeted promptly and seated in a nice booth. The bar was completely empty, only a few other tables in the restaurant were occupied. We ordered drinks and wedge salads - the wine was good and the salads were good. I ordered The Chop, it is their signature dish, it should be amazing - and the first few bites were delicious. I was very happy. This is a double cut, bone-in pork chop and it was moist and very flavorful. At about bite number four I was horrified to realize that the pork was COLD in the center, not merely cool but cold as in still rare, red, and cold from the refrigerator!  I made a few other cuts in the meat and the closer I got to the bone the colder the meat was!  I pushed my plate to the side and waited for our server to return. He passed the table twice but never stopped to ask how our food was. A different server passing our table asked if everything was okay and I told her that the pork was very cold in the center. She apologized and took it back to the kitchen. After about 7 minutes she returned with my pork, it had been butterflied and sliced into two thinner pork chops and cooked on the grill (grill marks now on inside area of the sliced chops). I was no longer excited about the pork as it was no longer a juicy, double thick chop but two smaller chops, worst of all it was now very overcooked and dry. I took one bite, ate some of my side dish and put my fork down.  (I will mention that my husband loved his bbq ribs.) During this time that I watched my husband enjoy his meal, our server still never stopped by the table - I could see him sitting at the edge the bar checking his cell phone so it was not because he was too busy with other customers.  When the second server came by to pick up my husband's plate she noticed that I had not eaten the pork, she asked if I wanted a box. I said that I would like the Brussels Sprouts boxed but that I did not want the pork. She removed the plate and returned with the Brussels sprouts. No concern over the fact that I had obviously not eaten more than five bites of my large $26 pork chop. Our original server never returned, my husband ordered dessert, we got the check, paid and left. No manager ever stopped by the table to see how we liked our meal, no one ever asked if the re-cooked food was prepared properly.  This is a marked departure from the level of service we have had over the past year. Unfortunately, the trend at Chop has been downward and I think it is time for us to find a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was alright. Ordered the Maui steak it was good. Although my wife ordered the filet medium well and it came out medium rare. Over all I don't think I'll be returning it's an expensive steak house that is no better than a Charleston's"}
{"text":"arrrgghh!!! I hate when a great restaurant takes a dive!!  Let's see, we haven't gone in 2 months and here is everywhere they now drop the ball.  The bartenders: They were great and friendly guys who would talk and chat it up with me and the Mrs. No longer. They actually hired the girl from CHAO up the street that was the reason we didn't go there! She's horrible and has a terrible permanent bitchface. Not sure of her name, tattooed Asian girl. We will just call her Miss Attitude.   The food special: No more Thursday night datenight?? Are you kidding? We must have sent 40 people there and turned them onto this restaurant for that special. No more.   The food prep. Terrible. The ribs were super dry when we went on Oct 21nd. The burgers were overcooked and the fries were ultra soggy.   Won't be going back for awhile if ever. Which sucks because we live right behind it. Time to explore other avenues."}
{"text":"Great location, good ambiance but the food is overpriced and below average. When you go out to eat you expect the quality of the food to be worthy of its price point. If the quality of the dishes are below average the rest of the experience is tainted... Like putting lipstick on a pig."}
{"text":"The steak her was good.  I had the basic baseball cut and wife had the sirloin.  I have to day though that mine tasted better and it was the cheaper of the two.  This is a steak you don't need A1. Had all the flavors you need and expect without it.  This is pave had an older crowd.  Great fora relaxing dinner or date night.  I enjoyed it.  Food was good."}
{"text":"My date and I thought this was a pretty cool looking place. The Bar is nicely decorated and the wait staff and bartenders were very helpful and easy on the eyes too. We started with the smoked salmon, great appetizer but we finished it in just a few bites. I ordered the steak frites and he ordered the steak salad. We finished everything on our plates. Portions here are on the lighter side but the $ is not. The waitress was attentive and friendly. The night started slipping with the dessert. So close! We ordered the pecan torte, which was a very large portion but it tasted like flour. Not sure if it was meant to be cooked to be soft but I couldn't eat it. The waitress swapped it for the lemon creme brulee. There were not a lot fo dessert options, only 3. I love creme brulee but the classic vanilla creme brulee is what I like. It was tasty but I really wanted that torte! The bill was under $60 (we didn't order cocktails it was way too hot that night and we just wanted to hydrate with H2O) and I had a Groupon. I think I will give it a second shot but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is over priced bar food and I would not recommend it to anybody. We went as a party of 9 people for an early dinner (4:30pm). For the 9 of us, it was over $250, which is fine except it was BAR FOOD..and no one had alcohol either! The service was slow for a Sunday at 4:30pm but we figured it was because we were a bigger party. The gratuity was included (of course because of the bigger party) so it almost seemed like the waitress was very laxed with the service.   On to the food..my daughter and I split the cheapest item on the menu - a bacon cheeseburger for $9. Oh wait...the sides are not included - French fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, or zucchini slices for $3-$5 more. Lovely..so now the cheapest item on the menu is a burger that does not come with fries so it actually turns into a $12 item. Which again would not be so bad if it actually was a burger WORTH $12. Alas it is not, because it's BAR FOOD. So here in lays my dilemma, overpriced bar food that is mediocre at best. The sweet potato fries were good but we didn't care for the zucchini, it was sliced way too thin.  Other people in party had the steak and mashed potato...they said it was okay but well over $30 for that dish!! I can't imagine paying those type of prices at a bar. I wouldn't get a steak there anyways..too big a risk. Everyone seems to think they can make a steak...and that's not the case. Especially for over $30.  The free dessert we got for my friends birthday turns out to be the best part of the meal! Their take on pecan pie and ice cream is delicious! I would go back there for that!!   Save your money..go to a bar to drink.   But if you want a good burger, I would visit The Habit - best burgers and fries/onion rings in the game. And so much cheaper. Although it is not table service, it's well worth the compromise."}
{"text":"Chop is a great restaurant really good food good drinks and the ambience in the place is just so superb. Everyone should try the awesome fries they are so good the brussels sprouts are delicious pretty much everything on the menu was really fresh and it never disappoints if you want to try it out you need to go during happy hour and enjoy the amazing drinks and appetizers"}
{"text":"Family took me here for my 42nd birthday. We have never been before. Great food!!  Try the fried pickles as an appetizer! I had the boneless ribeye...awesome!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Expectations are based on price. $39.00 for a filet and garlic mashed potatoes... $11.00 wedge salad. Just plain dressing on the salad...no blue cheese crumbles. The filet was not more than 3/4\" thick...about 4 to 5 oz.(oz. not indicated on menu) and average quality. For the price, I expected more.  The service was good but the kitchen had my mashed potatoes on my wife's plate and visa versa...not a big deal. With so many other options in the area, I have no reason to visit Chop again."}
{"text":"This is basically one big bar. Alas, the bar type food. The food can only be described as mediocre at best. Our server was super nice and attentive. The seating was comfortable, but we did come right when they first opened. I can imagine it gets more hectic as the evening progresses. If you are looking for a really great steak, head to Fleming's. If you are looking for a bar that serves food, then this is the place. Very very casual attire. No one was dressed up. T-shirts and shorts seemed the norm here. Prices are high for what you get. Don't expect a lot or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"These guys do a great job!  Ribeye (Maui Marinated) and key lime pie ALL DAY!!  Been here several times. I would definitely recommend if you're in the area. If you're not in the area, go there anyway."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for a date night dinner! I'm vegetarian and got spaghetti squash, which is absolute yum. My fiancé got pork chop, obviously the best entree to pick. Service is top notch too. Walked out tummy full and happy! Definitely going back again.   Chop, Thank you for the amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Party of seven went to Chop to celebrate my brother's 40th birthday.  From the food to the service, everything was great.  My brother is hard to please when it comes to food, he ordered the prime rib, said it was the best he had in a long time! Three of us ordered the special which was grilled halibut, wonderful! The desserts are a must, the lemon creme brûlée and the mint Oreo cookie were a huge hit. The decor is very sexy and I would recommend Chop to anyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food.  You must try the Moscow Mule.  Jill is amazing. Very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"For a steak place, it was really just \"ok\"...my filet was small, a little too well done, not juicy. My husbands ribeye was small and burnt as well. The bread pudding for dessert was really good though! If I'm going to spend $150 on steak for 2 people in the future, I'll go to The Keg, Ruth's Chris, or Mortons...."}
{"text":"Joined a friend for dinner there last night (Mother's Day). This place was fantastic. Aside from our server being a little slow at getting back to us for our order....the service was great.  I never had to ask to have my water glass filled.....which is a huge problem at most places. My friend and I split the swordfish special and the sirloin plate.....which were both cooked magnificently.  The swordfish just melted in your mouth and the sirloin was probably the best sirloin I've had. It was freezing cold in the restaurant.....but, that was the only uncomfortable factor. This has been added to my fave steakhouses"}
{"text":"Three times in a row the service has been off... tonight (SUN 29 APR), we ordered an appetizer before our entree... never got the app; the server offered to bring the app later, after we were well into the entree, but the offer was shallow, if not insincere...and no one from management came by our table to address the issue... it was a super slow night in the restaurant... not only did we not see, or receive acknowledgment from, management, but service was unacceptable for the nearly $200 I spent for dinner (just my wife and I, plus one order to go)... I had to go to the bar to order drinks while we waited for dessert... we brought an order home for the kids; once we arrived home, we discovered that the order was wrong, but not worth calling to try to correct it for the drive back given the late hour... The restaurant has a fairly high price point, and given, the service was lackluster and disappointing... the food was good: short rib and cauliflower au gratin was a good choice..., but not worth the headache and disappointment of the poor service. If this is the continued standard, we won't be eating there for much longer."}
{"text":"This spot was very romantic.  Found it with a groupon - $30 for $60 - would have been an okay deal for one person but the two of us ended up with a $150 bill because we ordered side dishes after seeing the people next to us having a steak, and that's it, delievered on a plate.  Not for me!  I ordered the salmon, it was delicious.  Perfectly prepared.  It came with parmesan brocolli, a nice side but odd pairing for the salmon."}
{"text":"Reservation was made for 6:45 and was greeted and seated promptly. There were 4 of us, including 2 children. I was a little worried as we arrived because it looked a little more of an adult type restaurant but ended up being fine. We sat in the corner of and my girls loved the pillow decor. We started with the crab cakes, girls ordered grilled cheese, my husband had the lamb chops and I ordered the rib eye. When our food arrived my husbands lamb chops came a little underdone. We told our waitress and she immediately took it back to get cooked a little more. My girls grilled cheese was delicious, I snuck in a bite and would definitely order it for myself. My steak was great and my husband demolished his lamb chops. The mash potato side was equally as good as my steak and I'm glad I have leftovers for tomorrow. We also ended our meal with the lava cake and bread pudding. Sad to say my little one only let me have a few bites of the bread pudding, next time I'll order my own. Looks like they have some great dinner specials that include bottles of wine which we will need to try. Thank you for a great night, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight for the first time very beautiful inside small dark nice booths seems like a perfect place for a romantic dinner except for the TVs in front of the bar with sports on and some very load guys at the bar screaming at the tv made me ask the question does this place want to be classy or does it want to be a sports bar? Opted for the $14 burgers which looked great going by my daughter had the mushroom burger the meat was dry and the mushrooms were so dry we wounded if they were dehydrated and my green chile burger was very dry as well and the fries very over salted  but the margaritas were good won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a new Chandler steakhouse restaurant down in the Ocotillo area, owned by the same owners of the Living Room and Sushi room next door..Just opened 2 weeks ago so we were excited to see what they were bringing new to the area, plus the reviews have been mixed.  We went early on a weekday for appetizers and wine to avoid any dinner rush.  The atmosphere is really nice here, very intimate, not loud like the sister restaurant (Living Room)..We sat at the bar, the 2 bartenders (Julie and Jazzlyn) were extremely  nice and efficient. Wine list is good, not great but what was really good here were the appetizers.  We had the grilled artichoke and smoked salmon and both of these were large portions and very good.  This was enough for us as a dinner.   We left by 6pm or so and by that time more people were filtering in for dinner and bar.  We had a very good experience here and will definitely be back given that there are very few higher end restaurants in the south Chandler area, but it's great to see new places opening."}
{"text":"this restaurant is in a really nice little shopping center with all white stucco-style buildings.  I ordered the mushroom swiss burger (sans the Swiss) and the Superfood side salad (sans goat cheese)   the burger was typical.  I liked the mushrooms.  I ordered it medium, but it came out more like a medium rare.  I didn't mind that much since I usually get my steaks medium rare, but I know others who would not like that.  I did not expect the salad to be in such a thick creamy dressing, but it was pretty tasty.  I really liked the addition of the cranberries and avocado.  the turnips on the salad were pretty flavorless but they added a nice crunch.  the salad even held up pretty well (bc it's kale) so I was able to eat my leftovers for lunch the next day.  I liked that the parking lot had plenty of spaces available to make parking a breeze.  and the servers and bus boys were very attentive.  they must have refilled our water glasses like 4+ times!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon awhile ago and we were very excited to try them.  The menu online looks fantastic, however it was not fantastic.  I don't think the price and quality of food match. We ordered the Downtown Fries for an appetizer and they were very good.  Both of our drinks were also very good.  When it came to the entree's and sides the quality wasn't really there. I ordered the ribs, they are $24 and come with a side. My friend tried one before I did and let me know they were cold.  I'm not talking room temperature, maybe had to sit under a warmer while waiting for the entree, I'm saying they were cold.  I sent them back, they came out maybe 5 minutes later, they were still cool too the touch but I was starving so I said it was fine. The weird part is it was only half the rack, half was warm and the other half was cold.  The flavor was good but it was difficult to eat because they were cold. The waitress did apologize and the runner who brought them back out apologized for them being cold.  My friend had the handcut ribeye and he said it was very good and he enjoyed it.  I tried his macaroni and cheese, it had a nice flavor but to me the noodles were very over cooked.  My only other thing was the fact that it is extremely dark in the restaurant but then there are the front doors and a side door with people coming and going.  It's extremely bright when they are opened and it's very distracting, not to mention that once you leave the restaurant if it's still daylight it is extremely difficult for your eyes to adjust to the brightness of the sun.  For the price of the food we will probably going somewhere else in the future.  For $24 I can get ribs pretty much everywhere and I bet they would be warm."}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time when a financial planner had his slide show presentation here, and then gave us our complimentary dinner.  Our menu consisted of four choices, the baseball sirloin, salmon, grilled pork chop, and the chicken breast.  I asked the server which of the 4 choices were customer's favorite and that the restaurant was known for.  She said the pork chop, so I selected that.  The wedge salad, being a wedge, had a small amount of blue cheese dressing poured onto the wedge, but the dressing did not make it down to the plate, so needless to say, there was not enough dressing for all that lettuce in that wedge, once you cut it down and separate the leaves.  Salad was very boring.  So I asked for a box and extra dressing for me to \"make my own salad\" when I get home.  Other people got their pork chop way before me.  I saw them trying to cut into it, so hard and dry it was, like vulcanized chicken breast that most restaurants overcook.  That is why I never choose chicken breast at a restaurant, usually cooked hard and dry.  I asked the man at the other table how his pork chop was, because it looked so dry to me, and he was having a hard time cutting it.  He said it was somewhat dry, and could have been cooked less.  Another man announced \"It's great!\" to which I said, \"YOU must like YOUR beef cooked WELL-DONE ! \".  But he acted like he did not hear me.   I saw both of them trying to dip their pork chop slices into something on their plates that was not there, cos it was too dry.   People's salmon looked dry, too.    Yes, my pork chop was so dry.   I asked the server for some liquid sauce, juice or gravy.  She brought me au jus, which was very very bland and flavorless, like water.  Boy, glad I am not ordering the prime rib as I would be disappointed in the au jus.  Golden Corral knows how to make au jus (they have prime rib several times a year).  The apple chutney helped moisten the pork chop.   The meat around the bones had more fat in it, and tasted quite good, but most of the chop was very very dry.   I asked for a box, and I am going to make posole out of my remaining dry white meat pork chop.  I am giving the pork chop 1 star.    The baked potato was large and very bland, meaning, really did not have enough \"goodies\" in it, only small amount on top (like the wedge lettuce and lack of dressing), with some (real) bacon sprinkles.  I put the potato in my box too, gonna add more butter and sour cream when I eat it at home.    People sitting next to me said their steak was good, and it looked good, they knew to order it red on the inside.   But it was sirloin, and I told them I could get sirloin at Golden Corral for $8.99 for Senior Early Bird when you pay just before 4 pm, when the dinner menu comes out.    I thought the service was very good, as you can see, I am a rather demanding Foodie.  When I told our server that the pork chop was so dry, she was speechless.  I give her (pretty, dark straight hair) 4 stars for bringing me everything I asked for (beefy lemons, glass of ice, and Splenda for me to make lemonade with my water, the au jus, the boxes, and take out cup for my home made lemonade), and being gracious and sweet about everything she provided me.    So the service upped my 1 star pork chop to 2 stars overall.  I think I would have been happier with the ribs, and other items I see on the menu, but only 4 items were offered to us on our private party \"Group\" menu.  Well, at least I didn't have to pay for my dinner."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  Is sometimes packed during happy hour.  The steaks are amazing. Great place for a date night or night with friends.  Small space so make a reservation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are BIG fans of CHoP! It's down the street from our house and we've been 4times since opening. Food has always been great, I go for the Salmon, my BF likes the steak, either way you can't go wrong! We prefer the bar over a table, all the bar tenders are super nice and always remember us! We will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"My mom bought a groupon for my fiancé and to try this place. It's not far from where we live and the groupon was actually a really good deal (some of the restaurant ones tend not to be). We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't crowded, but did start to fill up. The staff was friendly and the food was great. My fiancé said it was the best prime rib he had eaten in a long time. The cut of meat was gigantic; it took up 3/4 of the plate. I too had steak, hand cut ribeye. It was a little fatty but that's just part of that cut of meat. It was cooked perfectly and we both left feeling full and that we had gotten our money's worth. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend,"}
{"text":"Some good, some bad.  First the good, I like the atmosphere, dark cozy and a bit quieter than their sister place the Cougar errr I mean Living Room down the way.    The Happy Hour is top notch $5.00 glasses of wine, beer and well mix drinks.  The food selection on the HH menu was also decent and what we had was very good.  Service was attentive even though the bar is rather small it was packed and the two bartenders were running around constantly.  They were also friendly and knowledgeable which is always a plus.  Now onto the bad.  My wife and I split the Maui Rib-eye, I think the price was $30.00.  Now don't get me wrong I have NO problem paying $30.00 for a steak with no side,  it is the norm in most fine dining steakhouses, however when this one arrived it was not a $30.00 steak.  The rib-eye was thin, way to much grizzle around the outside, cmon guys trim it a bit?  And to be honest I have purchased better cuts of steaks at Costco and Fry's. After my wife's first bite she said you can cook them better too.  The point of going to a fine dining steakhouse is to get a steak I don't want to pay $30 for at Whole Foods or AJ's.    We will no doubt go back for Happy Hour, but not so sure about having steak at a place called Chop is kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"My first cut of this update was really nasty.  The good news the food is good.  The service was good.  The bad news it was too damn cold in the restaurant.  It was too cold because the staff had the doors wide open for the first  15 minutes we were in the place (had to ask to have the doors closed).  After about another 15 minutes or so, one of the owners/managers/investors (who was there to eat) decided he was cold and wanted the heat turned down and the doors opened. They didn't open the doors but turning the heat down succeeded in making the place cold again.  WTF people??  As I said, my first cut on this was nasty and I rated them a 1 star (the owner/manger/investor really hacked me off) but after further review that might not be fair."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to come to this place and was very let down. This is my first time here and I certainly will not come back here again. First off, we sat down for good 10 minutes and had no idea who our server was. We literally had to walk to the front & ask the hostress to get service for us. Our waitress finally showed up 5 minutes later to take our order (after we asked around for her). She was nice at first and the appetizer showed up at a decent time. Then, we waited for at least 30 minutes and our meal still didn't show up. I understand that the kitchen could be busy at times. But the server didn't stop by to tell us anything nor checking up on us. We tried to wave her down and she pretended she didn't see us. Since we sat across from the kitchen, we could see total of 5 cooks (at the least) and yet only 3 were working. The other 2 were chatting away or watching TV. We sat on the table and noticed that people who sat at the bar got much better service than us sitting at the table. The only time our waitress checked up on us consistency was when it was time for us to pay the bills.   I still want to give them 2 stars because the restaurant is well decorated and the food is decent. But the service definitely isn't there. I will not recommend anyone to come here if you want good service."}
{"text":"After my first trip here, I simply cannot imagine finding a reason to return.   The service this past Saturday evening was *awful*.  It wasn't even at Fuddrucker's levels, let alone what I would expect out of an establishment that charged me $38 for 2 tiny pieces of still-raw Lamb (we will get to that one later).  When we were seated we gave a drink order, and then the waitress brought out some bread.  She brought 4 pieces of bread for 6 people.  I know it is complimentary, but what is that supposed to compliment exactly?!  Turns out it perfectly complimented the aloof and tragic service we were to receive the rest of the night.    We spent the evening asking to have drinks refilled, asking for more water, asking for the simplest things that should have just been done at a restaurant that proposes to be of this high caliber.  It was not.  The server couldn't even remember what people were drinking, a nearly empty glass with ice, a straw, and a lemon wedge received \"should I get you another kiltlifter?\"  No, you shouldn't replace my iced tea with a beer thank you very much... maybe there is a reason I'm not consuming alcohol?    Then the food.  Ah yes, the chance for redemption.  It didn't happen.  The wedge salad was ridiculously overpriced for 1/4 of a $.99 head of old, bitter, wilted iceberg lettuce (you can AT LEAST take the bitter, white parts off of the lettuce.  At the very least, remove the brown parts... that's bare minimum.  Pretty sure even McDonald's wouldn't have served this salad).  The bleu cheese dressing was very good, it would have been nice to have enough for more than 4 bites of bitter lettuce because it was doing a fine job of covering it up.  Naturally, the server never bothered to ask how it was.  I asked for more dressing, though, and was told there would be an additional charge so I declined.  Pay more for an already overpriced salad that you deleted the bacon from just to have enough dressing to cover up the bitter lettuce.  Hmm, nah.    My entrée came out.  Two tiny bits of lamb, $38.  Fine, whatever... I'll deal with it. The baked potato looked great, it was good... I cut into the lamb and it's raw in the middle.  Now, you would think our waitress would have come back by to see how everything was.  Why would you think that after what I've already said above?!  She didn't.  I'd have told her it was gross, undercooked... in fact when she came by to collect the plates finally (empty glasses everywhere on the table, appetizer plates still sitting around dirty, dishes the guests had stacked themselves now on the edge of the table.. pathetic) she asks if she can take it.  I said, very plainly, \"well it isn't cooked so I'm sure not going to eat it.\"  She removes the plate, says nothing, and proceeds to still charge me for food that I complained about at my first opportunity and makes absolutely no concessions to me.  I was ripped off by this restaurant for $38, right there.  That, friends, is an actual criminal act.  I was charged for something I did not receive.  Theft.  So we had desert, which was average and overpriced.  The crust on the key lime pie was severely overdone, bread pudding was dry, pecan torte tasted good but the texture was terrible and it fell apart gracelessly.    So all of that said, I can't imagine there is any reason for me to bother again.  It was awful, nothing was done to make it less so, no one seemed to care.  I suppose they are content to ride out the 3.5 star rating, pathetic for this price range, and count on continued business from nearby Intel to keep the doors open.  They simply aren't striving to be exceptional, or even meet the needs of their own pricing category.  Avoid."}
