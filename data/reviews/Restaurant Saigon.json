{"text":"The people writing posts above a star are inept at tasting food. Period.  I've had the unfortunate chance to visit this sorry excuse for an Asian restaurant and it was by far the most pathetic and unsanitary showing of anything remotely related to food.  At first glance, the menu seems to be quite big, albeit set in an odd location in a tiny little basement scrap in a semi-detached surviving as a free-standing on Metcalfe.  However, the food is simply a combination of the surviving basics: chicken, noodles from Metro, and cheap frozen vegetables.  The prices are also above $10 for a bowl of noodles and it WAY too overpriced to even think of as acceptable given that even the restaurants nearby don't charge above $4 for a bowl of soup.  Furthermore, any typical Pho or Vietnamese restaurant won't dare serve a hefty portion of noodles, rice or meat for over $6.  Saigon just markets to McGill students who A) don't know the city very well B) people with terrible tastes in food, and C) self-loathing Asians from the students societies who are too lazy to seek out quality.  The food that I and my friend both got was not only the wrong order, with no offer by our waiter/owner to replace or refund our meals but also had blood raw chicken in it!  When we both confronted the server about it, he took my chopsticks and stirred the food around and said it was fine and walked off.  I left without even paying for the bill at that point.  Saigon is pretty much named after the sentiments a war veteran feels when the name is uttered to induce fear, hatred and gunpowder.  The food's quality is as primitive as both fighting factions were induced to and the service is pretty anarchic as the war had been lived out to be.    The only thing this restaurant mimics about Asia it its slums- both in terms of sanity and in general deportment."}
{"text":"my wife needed some comfort food, and restaurant saigon delivered.  yes, we were in need of some pho, which in montreal is called \"soupe tonkinoise\".  since we live in denver (CO), we are accustomed to the usual mound of lime wedges, basil, and culantro, which accompanies this delicious vietnamese dish.  none arrived.  we figured this was a canada/montreal thing.  however, we were pleased by the very hot and delicious broth.  the difference seems to be thicker noodles and a heavier/fattier broth.  my wife loved it.  the meal was delivered quickly, and it was cheap for montreal standards."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for budget friendly Asian food in the downtown area and the menu appeared reasonable, so we thought we'd give it a try. We started with a fried won ton appetizer. It consisted of about six fried wontons containing microscopic pieces of chicken in the middle. Thought the entrees would be better. Thought wrong. I ordered chicken red curry, which had pinkish chicken pieces floating in a brownish broth with vegetables. The chicken tasted under cooked. My husband ordered the General chicken which was soggy, full of dark meat & covered in a drippy brown sauce. It came with rice that had a dead winged insect sticking out the top of the rice mound. After picking that out, he later found another! Not to be out done, I found one in my rice also. We decided at that point to stop eating.   Never coming back. No quality to the food whatsoever. Not to mention, the proprietor seemed utterly disinterested in our dining experience even though there was only one other customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place one night out with a friend since we were around the area. I ordered vietnamese pho with beef(large), it was by far one of the worst pho I have ever had. if you know how good pho tastes, I would definitely do not recommend going here. The soup had no flavor, very blend. Place felt dirty and old.   I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"It is late at night. You are hungry and staying in a downtown hotel. What are you options? Trendy nightspot (too dressy and you're too old), hotel room service/ restaurant (overpriced slop with an added service charge), dragging your self across town to open shop (I don't think so).   Enter Restaurant Saigon! Cheap food, Cheap Flavor, but good times. I had the General's Chicken. It was no gourmet, but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star.  The owners are Chinese.   Peanut and fish sauce were awful.  Owner can was rude. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"My francophone pal Véro recommended this Vietnamese eatery, and it was a great local find: cheap, tasty, and very friendly. In fact, upon learning that my niece loves shrimp, the waiter brought over a free sampling of the house specialty, which was promptly devoured. All four of us somehow ended up ordering vermicelli with our meals, but each was radically different in flavor -- from curry-flavored spice with a major kick to savory broth. Even my nephew, who'd been hesitant at trying such an alien-sounding dish, wolfed his down.  Our only complaint: the wait. The waiter knew we'd been waiting too long and even came over to apologize, but we still waited half an hour for our food, and none of us asked for anything out of the ordinary. (Although Véro did theorize that they might have made a run to the store to get my tofu, since it wasn't on the menu.)"}
{"text":"Been to this place 3 times, but only because it is at such a convenient location and because I don't want to have Subway every day. The food is very disappointing. I have tried the pho: little meat, little flavour, not the right taste. But pho was a better choice than anything fried, like the sweet and sour chicken or salt and pepper chicken or anything of that sort: there is barely any meat, mostly flour, and the little meat that there is is dry. The portion is not that bad though. The service was ok, nothing extraordinary. Two stars because of the cheap price and the 10% for students. The waiter even let me have it once when I forgot my student ID. Quite nice. But I would avoid it as much as possible."}
{"text":"I have a sentimental attachment to Restaurant Saigon, because it fed me on so many cold winter night after hours of study at the library. But even when I was starving, I stuck to only two dishes: pad thai (beef or chicken) and fried rice (beef or chicken). The rest of the menu is not really good, in my opinion. Even with these safe options, I found that the freshness of the meat was variable, and so was the proportion of veggie/rice/meat/seasoning. It gives the impression that the cook is perpetually in a bad mood, not paying attention, and using lesser quality ingredients. That's a shame, because it's McGill's closest asian food joint.  The vietnamese coffee is ok, but it takes some time to prepare. Don't get the pho.  P.S. The owner has really good memory, and remembers most regular clients. He's not very chatty though."}
{"text":"Great cheap Vietnamese place to go for lunch. Pretty much all of their dishes can be had for less than $10 and their all pretty tasty!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place isn't horrible.. But I can't say i'll be going back. If your downtown and want Vietnamese food then go to Saigon style on St.Catherine.. which I've already done a review on.. It's cheap and food is amazing. But anyways, back to this place.. Decor is plain and kind of dirty, there was one man working who just sat a few tables down from us looking bored out of his mind,lol.. guess that was because we were the only people in there! Imperial rolls weren't bad, the food was alright.. But after having DELICIOUS Vietnamese food right downtown(Saigon Style), I have no reason to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Went for beef pho and it really was not even pho honestly. It seemed like some kind of tasteless yellow broth that made it look like day old chicken noodle soup. There was barely any beef, almost a whole choped onion and no sriracha or hoisin was offered. Didnt even get bean sprouts or anything other than the noodles and beef.. Might go back one day and try a different meal but only if im really bored of everything else.   Also it is always empty, not dirty but doesnt look freshly cleaned either. Dont expect service."}
{"text":"There is a large piece of stone hanging at the left wall above the second level, just above the entrance in the restaurant.  The exterior brick walls are about to crumble.  Please report this so they secure the building which is not safe."}
{"text":"When asked where was their Pho in the menu, it was listed under Tonkinese. The heck is Tonkinese??  So I got their Pho and was it bad. Just shreds of one kind of beef. No tripe, no brisket, no rare steak, no tendons etc. And no basil leaves. It came only wih bean sprouts and a 2 sad looking shriveled up sprigs of cilantro.  The only good thing about eating here was the strong US dollar."}
{"text":"Go to place for a quick bite in between study sessions. Cheap meals (less than 10-15$) especially with the 10% student discount. Perfect for students. Don't expect good customer service or quality food however, they bring out their food so fast I'm pretty sure they just microwave it in the back.  Mmmmmm salt and pepper chicken yo'"}
{"text":"Seriously this is one of the worst Asian food restaurant ever. We were craving pho nearby our hotel so we went despite the fairly positive reviews, but we were so wrong. I had a order of egg rolls which tasted and smelled wrong. The oil they fried these in must've been bad or old. I had never tasted anything that horrible before. I almost wanted to leave the place but waited for my beef pho which I must admit was the worst ever! The soup was bland, the beef smelled and tasted old, there was only green onions as garnish, no cilantro, bean sprouts, basil, whatsoever! My friends ordered Pat Thai, Kung Pao Chicken, Black a Bean Chicken, etc. but they were all just horrible! The only thing that tasted good was the Sriracha..."}
{"text":"Honestly I love Viet food but this place was just bad. Perhaps pho is better but vermicelli dish (which I ordered) tasted awful. Could not finish and that's rare for me!"}
{"text":"It is not good. At lunch time, it was full of people, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. The service was good. The food was not."}
