{"text":"Any true desi will tell you that the ultimate rite of passage into browndome is to be able to consume brown street food without a whimper or a tear and with a smile on your face, much like the smiling faces of the clientele of Lahore Chaat and Paan House.

There are 3 reasons I adore this place:

1) Bun Kabab: Ok here goes the literal translation. Bun = Burger buns, Kabab = ground meat patty with spices, dipped in egg, pan fried. sounds simple and boring? NOT. These bun kababs pack a serious punch. The spicy ones contain a chutney that consists only of green chillies and coriander. Get a accompanying Fanta/Thumbs Up (brown soft drinks) in true desi fashion to douse the fires going off in your mouth.

2) Paan: I had to turn to wikipedia for help with this one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paan.  Essentially consumed in South Asia as an after meal digestive tool.

3) Kulfi/Falooda: Ice cream seasoned with pistachios or almonds, cut up into pieces and served in a rosy milk concoction with shredded nuts on top. Life does not get better than this.

All of this for a grand total of $12. Yup, being brown has its perks :)"}
{"text":"Went there 3 nights in a row (past midnight!) on my visit last week. I FINALLY found the authentic Lahore taste there... which sadly, I've not found in USA. 

Anyway, nice neat shop.. very clean and the owner, Butt sb, is a very sweet man. Over the 3 nights, my friends and I tried: 

Shami kebab: 5/5... very nicely made! They give their kebabs in round buns instead of long ones but that's ok. You can tell them if u want less/more  chatni, onions etc.. with it without egg etc 

Aloo bun kebab: 4/10... was on the sweeter side for some odd reason

Papri chaat: 5/5 .. big serving, great for 2ppl 

Dahi Bhallay: 5/5 .. fresh n awesome 

Samosa chaat: 3/5.. I found the samosa stale
 but again, large serving food enough for 2 ppl 

Falooda drink: 2/5 didn't like the taste that much 

Mango drink: 3/5.. wasn't chilled enough for my taste 

Meethay paan: 5/5 .. customized as per my taste and melt in your mouth good!!! 

They also carry all desi stuff like pakola n suparis etc"}
{"text":"Really good Kashmiri chai and ice cream falooda. Highly recommend it if you are looking for a nice chai spot."}
{"text":"I have seen this place grow up in front of my eyes: a few years ago, when the store was a small run down shack to the new, much larger (yet still relatively run down :) location. P.s being run down is a sign of good food in Pakistan, so fear not!

They are known for their bun kababs. The bun is pan fried to perfection, the kabab has the right amount of meat and flavor. Add some home made chutney and spicy ketchup and the resulting product is sheer awesomeness. 

To this, throw in the run down-ness of the store, the shalwaar kameez wearing aunties, the Hindi movies/songs playing in the background and a bottle of Pakola and it's as if you have teleported to Karachi just to have a meal. 

And to boot, the prices are very reasonable. 

Only negative: no credit/debit cards accepted so bring cash."}
{"text":"Authentic. The food is good. It's a hole in the wall place and cash only.

We had the sev puri and the golgappas and both were well made. The sauth (red meetha chutney) was excellent. Also the kulfi is nice - homemade with khoya.

Recommended."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something to clean out your stomach this would be your spot. Avoid at all cost. It's re heated food (and they literally do this in the microwave in front of you) unfortunate we had already paid and didn't look like their was a chance of refund.

We ordered bhel puri, gol guppa, and bun kabobs 

Bhel puri-super un-authentic and portion was not enough for two people to even share. It was super saucy almost soup like and tasted like it was filled with a sort of soy sauce. 

Gol guppa- again portions are despicable for what they charge. They give this small container with the filling which includes just boiled chick peas, plain yogurt, and store bought hot sauce. The pani (water) was extremely sour. To a point where it was inedible.

And for the grand finally the bun kabob. If you're a Pakistani this has got to be one of your favorite alternative to the American cheeseburger. Sadly most places I've visited, including this one, fall way below the acceptable level. The Patti was old refrigerated and reheated. Gross! All they did was slap this on a bun with some chutni sauce. The Patti's refrigerated status was over powering the sauce. No fresh onions,lettuce, nothing. I was very disappointed. I know that Toronto isn't the scene for Pakistani food but I had some high hopes....
