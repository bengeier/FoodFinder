{"text":"Had a great lunch here. The French onion soup was done very well as well as the black bean burger. It was very quiet and since we were the only patrons the waitress took very good care of us. Lunch for two adults and two children $50 w/tip."}
{"text":"Sorry but they really missed the mark on their Mother's Day brunch... They were WAY overbooked and WAY understaffed.  Food was average at best... I was hoping for more. They only had decaf coffee.... And the stations had long lines and at times no one working them...Which was unacceptable. We won't be back for Father's Day...but will give them another chance for dinner soon."}
{"text":"been to six horses 3 times.

the good: 
the food is actually pretty good.  chef does a nice job on most dishes, but our pizza's are too doughy (need to be crispy) and needs more spice.  nice salads, limited wine list but very good beer list with many drafts in house.  reasonable prices

the bad: 
service !  have to wait way too long to get started, then drinks took about 25 minutes to get.  once we got salads and appetizers, our main courses arrived with ONE minute later!  we asked if they could hold the dinners until we finished our appetizers and they did.  when we actually were ready for our main courses, wife's fish was cold and my medium rare steak was warm, ... but exceedingly well done. each of three times, we talked to the manager about our concerns.  the last time she said they had lots of turn over in staff lately and had many inexperienced kids (pretty obvious about the lack of experienced restaurant skills) filling in , and when i questioned her,  she admitted they needed to do more training.  such a disappointment as i am a local and have gently tried to offer constructive criticism to improve my local eatery.   

the ugly: 
service! after 3 bad dinners there, and three conversations with management, we will not be back and opt for mad jacks, 1815 tavern or james place which are all right around the corner and quite pleasant, .... and all have good service from professional waiters and waitresses!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in the heart of Aurora. Food is good and pub style . Love the bar area as it super old school- tile floor, wood, plush seating in some areas. Swanky wood and glass bar. Always good service and never really crazy busy. Food  is so good and the happy hour prices are the best-flatbreads and shrimp taco is the way to go ."}
{"text":"Really good food, friendly staff.  Can't wait to see how all the renovations keep progressing!   Aurora needs some more good restaurants"}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu features local, fresh ingredients and the ambiance couldn't be better. The tavern is located inside the inn and has the appearance of a cozy pub with a fireplace and live music at times. The Cutting Board restaurant is also nearby that I believe shares the same menu. 

I ordered the Caesar salad and fish and chips - both were delicious...especially the fish. The reading was perfectly crispy, which is so rare in a fish and chips recipe. 

I'm definitely planning to become a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and burger.   Great choices in beers.  Excellent burger."}
{"text":"I arrived at Six Horses/Cutting Board  for lunch with my daughter on a rainy Thursday. There were no other people around when I walked in to the hotel. I looked in the restaurant and the Tavern, didn't see anyone and asked the girl at the hotel desk if I should just seat myself. She said yes. So I walked into the bar area, chose a table and sat down. There were two other people eating at another table and I got the impression that they were employees. After not seeing anyone anywhere for a bit, and being ignored by everyone in the area, I got up and went to the front desk. I asked the girl sitting there if they were serving lunch. \"I don't  know,\" was her response. Another employee walked up and she asked him if they were serving lunch. \"I don't  know....,\" was his insightful reply. Then they both proceeded to ignore me and started talking about something else. 
I walked out to find my daughter pulling into the parking lot. We left and went to Mad Jack's Pub on Chillicothe Rd in the center of Aurora. I suggest everyone else do that too."}
{"text":"Another charming small town find. Cozy ambiance, friendly service, good food. Went on a Saturday and had guitar player and singer Erin Burke entertain us with friendly and recognizable songs that offered nice background entertainment without being too loud or drowning out conversation. 
We got steak, burgers, salad, flatbread pizza, a cheese dip, and a piece of cheesecake for dessert, and a good variety of beers.  All was great. 
I love good food and good service but would have loved this place for ambiance alone. It was an added bonus that all the other elements were great too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not much of a crowd here. Tiny place in a hotel. Bartender was great but not really any reason to stay. Or come back."}
{"text":"My mom, partner, and I just left this place. We walked in and there was 5 other people in a place designed to hold 30+. We sat down and 8 minutes later, no service. \"Should we go to the bar? Do we order there?\"

To the bar we go. Sat for another 5 minutes before we stopped the manager to ask for service. She waited more minutes to tell the bartender and it was over 15 minutes from the time we walked in till we had any contact from the bartender or any service provider there. 

Mom asked which Sam Adams they had, don't know, have to check. Partner asks which Great Lakes they had, don't know gotta check. We then said three times which beer he wanted and she still started to pour the wrong beer. I then asked for a cocktail menu, no cocktails on it, so I ask her what their house martinis are and she laughs at me before saying \"dirty.\" 

The rest of the visit was the same, no need to torture anyone with the details. In short: rude staff, excessive wait ties, and management that was not helpful. In terms of looks, bar has some notable features, but is disjointed and has things that clash."}
{"text":"Stayed at the aurora inn while working a horse show at Chagrin Valley Farm. It was a nice surprise to find the tavern attached. 
I can't speak for the food--we only stopped for drinks. But the bartender was awesome, drinks were strong and well done. 

Oh and my boyfriend proposed on the patio. So I'm automatically a fan of this place now"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Aurora. The decor is beautiful with a mix of prohibition era vintage with modern amenities, like USB ports to charge up and purse hooks at the bar seats. Live music Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. Most importantly, an excellent choice of cold draft beers and one of the best collections of hard to find bourbons and ryes in the Cleveland market. The food choices were surprisingly vast and tasty. Nice patio is a perk."}
