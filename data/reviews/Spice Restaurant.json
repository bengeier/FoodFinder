{"text":"This restaurant has extremely slow service. The food came out cold and was over priced. Grilled chicken was tough and not well seasoned. I could not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Restaurant is located inside the hotel. Kind of noisy. We came to try this place out because we bought a Restaurant.com certificate. The food is overpriced so with the certificate it made the price more reasonable. The server was friendly and we received our food promptly. The food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast at the poorly staffed hotel restaurant because I'm staying here at the Sheraton Four Points.

Breakfast was okay. Nothing to write home about. Ate the egg white mushroom and spinach omelet. A little greasy but okay. Glad they had a healthy option. Also came with fruit. Again, not terrible. It was just okay. 

Service sucked. Waiter was nice but clearly did not give a crap about being there. You could tell she was more interested in gossiping even though I mentioned (more than once) I had to leave at 11:15am and needed to get out of there."}
{"text":"I was on training from out of town and had an opportunity to have lunch at Spice, I had Cheese Steak sandwich this was one of the best sandwich I ever had - Philadelphia is famous for best cheese steak which I had a chance to have one when I was there, believe me Spice's cheese steak ranks with the best."}
{"text":"I could eat the club sandwich on gluten free bread every day,  and the grilled Caesar is amazing.  The girls are really nice and attentive, but it was really slow so I'd hope they'd be. 
I work in the area, so I stop by often. I'd recommend it to any of the business people in the area. 

There are great beers on tap that rotate frequently. There is always something local from Arizona. There is otherwise a full bar and they can make anything that you ask for. 

Major games are always on or available on the TVs in the lounge. I've watched many of the World Cup games there."}
{"text":"Only eaten at Spice once.  The enticement of it serving \"American, Mediterranean and Indian-inspired dishes, always priced fairly and prepared to perfection\" drew me in.

I dare you not to laugh at the Soup du Jour available in sizes Cup $4 or Bowel $7.  LOL.  Classic!  Today is Oct 16, 2014.  Let's see how long it takes them to correct the spelling.

Anyway, the dining area looked clean and we got to choose whichever table we wanted.  Unfortunately it did not give off the hustle and bustle atmosphere that I'm used to seeing at a standalone restaurant.  Also the sounds and smells of flavorful food were not in the air.  Not even while our food was being prepared.  Such a shame.

Service was good, but as we were the only ones eating at the time I can't compare the waitstaff.  The food was decent, but nothing too exciting:

Party 1 had greek and caesar salads as well as blacken salmon fillet 
Liked.  4 stars
Portion of bill was $40

Party 2 ordered apps Mumbai Medley of Chicken as well as Asian Chicken Fillets 
Did not like.  1 star.  Kept complaining about the odd tasting sauces
Portion of bill was $20

Party 3 ate a sandwich and fruit
Liked. 4 stars
Portion of bill was $20

I know you're looking at this like - whoa!  You paid how much?  Yeah, well, they're hotel prices.  And like I said, I've only eaten there once.  Most likely, I would not eat there again because venturing over to the restaurants at Metrocenter would probably prove to be a cheaper eat."}
{"text":"The worst place to ever go and eat at. Service is awful, people are rude, food is gross and disgusting.  No one cares here, it is not worth the money you spend at all."}
{"text":"Walked in - Place was completely empty. That should've been our clear sign - to run.
But no, we sat, there was only one worker there (she seated us and took our order as well, hence the title of \"worker\")  no other employees to be seen. But she was nice and said she made a killer bloody mary. so we asked for two.. THEY WERE PERFECTLY PREPPED, Seriously delicious. The pizza we ordered never arrived, so asked for the pizza to go, and she said we still couldn't have the pizza to go because it was in the oven and needed 15 more minutes! lol we had to get back to work! um no thanks lady , just cancel the order., so had the two rounds of drinks and left - the bill was only $25.00 for 4 drinks. normal i guess! anyway i feel like the food shouldn't have taken so long since we were literally the only customers in the restaurant. so for that reason the 2 stars, i don't really feel like giving them a second try since it was an uninteresting place anyway."}
