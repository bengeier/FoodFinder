{"text":"Low class portguese food. Smells like a sewer. Avoid at all costs! Steak is done one way- medium and thats it. They use Nesquick Sauce as a topping for the desserts. Go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by Portuguese. Big disappointment! We had the \"house\" Cod and it was really a waste of fish. The food came out in 15 minutes which indicates just reheating. The potato chips -not typical."}
{"text":"This place is not horrid. If you're expecting a hipster dining experience Ã  la Ossington strip then you're in the wrong place. You will not see plaid shirts, lensless black-rimmed glasses or beards here, instead you'll find Portuguese families enjoying a meal together. Yes, the ambience is a little sterile with their tiled floors and vinyl seats but that's how they roll.  The food is not something you'd request as a last supper but it's also not horrid or low-class. I had the house steak which came with tasty gravy and crispy fries. My only complaint was my medium steak came to me well done.    I came here on the recommendation of a Portuguese friend who dined here."}
{"text":"Bad food quality. Roasted potaotes were from last night of even before (you can taste what's fresh or not). Beware of what tou pay... They'll add a few extra cents to your debit / credit transaction."}
{"text":"Save your money and spend it somewhere else! This place was recommended to me by Portuguese, but it's far from authentic &  delicious Portuguese food that I am familiar with. What a dissapointment!"}
