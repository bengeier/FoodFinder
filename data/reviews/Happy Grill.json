{"text":"If you go to Happys , you become part of the Happy's family! Great variety, simple good food with generous portions! We love Leo, Donna and the entire crew. Try it you will love it!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend like to try out various breakfast places around the area since I just moved here. I saw this place and saw the photo of the biscuit and gravy and since it is my favorite I decided to give it a try. I really should've gone to bojangles instead. 

The service was extremely slow and the waitresses seemed to have \"something better to do\". The food took 25 minutes to get to us and they didn't even have the biscuits and gravy. My boyfriend ordered a side of toast to the French toast which he never got. The French toast was chewy also. I had a breakfast sandwich with hash browns. The portion size of the hash browns was small and it was not very good quality. 

Didn't even get a drink refill until we got the check. Also saw a worker spill toothpick and with his bare hands proceeded to fill it back in...

Say what you want but for a small diner I expected better and friendlier service and much better breakfast."}
{"text":"Great find.  Passed it frequently for years yet didn't know it was there until a friend told me about it.  Terrific breakfast, great service.  Open 7 days a week until 2 PM, breakfast served all day.  Try the home made bread, it's fabulous.  Love seeing my food prepared, that way I know the cooking area is clean."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  The service was friendly and attentive.  The breakfast burrito, pancakes and grits were perfect.  We loved it and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time here and like the first I was impressed. Today it was more crowded being Sunday. It's a nice small, family spot to enjoy good food and great service. The portions are good, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"HOMEMADE BUNS:  If you go here I recommend the Cheeseburger.  They make their own hamburger buns and they are delicious.  They bake a lot of their own bread.  I usually order soda because their iced tea always seems to have a sour taste.  They also serve breakfast all day.  At least all day meaning till they close at 2pm."}
{"text":"This place is great, family run and the homemade food is prepared right out in front of you. I live in Denver and visit here because of relatives in the area. I found Happys because I was looking for Internet a few years ago and sat down to eat. The service is great and very friendly and the price is very reasonable. I make it a point to come here with my dad every time I visit."}
{"text":"We go to eat at Happy's Grill every week in my previous review I mentioned coming here for many years in all those years I have never once been served anything that was delicious. They make their own bread for everything from the French toast to the buns you get your hamburger on. And he makes a totally different breed to be served with meals that is so melt in your mouth good it's crazy. I have had breakfast and lunch here and I have tried about everything on the menu it is all freshly made. Real beef and chicken not frozen, they make their own fried squash and onion rings. They make their own cole slaw for the hot dogs which they also make their own chili for. I can not say enough how fresh and everything is fantastic. Yes it is small there are 8 booths and about 12 chairs at the counter and yes, there is sometimes a little wait when they are busy. BUT they are making every single thing fresh one order at a time if you don't believe me sit at the counter and watch them cook you will be amazed. As long as they are open I will continue to be a regular here the service is so friendly you feel like you're coming to eat with family. It deserves 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"\"An old-fashioned kitchen\"

For a few years I passed by this little gem, always saying, \"I'm going to try that place\". So finally one sunny morning I ventured out to the infamous \"Happy Grill\". 

As I walked in I knew I had found a great breakfast spot. The layout is what I like to think of as \"old-fashioned\" because the kitchen runs the entire length of the place. Something you don't see anymore. A row of backed stools line the counter with a series of booths across from them along the hand painted wall. The wall depicts the theme; happy chickens and pigs running around in a grassy field with the smiling chef centered giving two thumbs up, spatula in hand ready to serve up something tasty. The restaurant reminds me of something out of a movie with it's nostalgic feel.

With only a staff of about five, this place manages to keep up with the bustling demand of grumbling bellies from all over. They all are very friendly here and the appreciation of your presence is felt.

A very clean establishment; the tables are shining and the floor is swept and tidy. Condiments are neatly organized and plentiful. Bathrooms are clean.

The food is typical breakfast food made with love and is tasty. They also do lunch, which I've yet to try. Everything I've tried here has been deliciously devoured. They uniquely bake their own bread which is light and fluffy. You can try some with your meal! Also you can order a loaf to go. They also make meringue cookies that go feat with a cup of joe. 

I think what I like most about this place is the value. You can get out of here for usually less than ten bucks with a full belly. 

I usually go early in the morning and miss the rush. I have seen quite the after-church rush here. 

Overall a wonderful kitchen with good food at a great price, good people with great attitudes, and good service that will keep you coming back makes for a Happy Grill."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch. I had the buffalo wrap with grilled chicken. There was not any blue cheese but I did not miss it or even think about it until just now bc the wrap was that good!  Flavorful with a kick without being overwhelmingly hot. The potato salad was mustardy and just right.  My friend let me have some of his fried squash and OMG the entree envy I had. From scratch nicely breaded and fried.  Good service. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were in the area looking for a decent breakfast spot and found it. There were no reasons to not give 5 stars. 

Place was clean enough - it's a cute little diner. 

Good was cheap enough - $4.55 for 2 eggs, grits, sausage and toast. 

Staff was friendly enough - coffee was kept filled and other servers even asked how we were doing. 

If we were in the area again, I'd have no problem coming back. 

Good job, Happy!"}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall. Go in, it's not too spacious, cozy, and the staff are very friendly. I ordered a Tuna Melt, and it was pretty tasty. I ate with two others, who also loved what they ordered. I don't remember what they ordered. Forgive me! 
The service was great. Quick, easy, friendly. Just the way it should be. 
This place is simple, and it is a great option for lunch out. Not too pricey, nothing too fancy, nothing too complicated. 
I walked in doubting the place, but I walked out pretty happy. I guess that's why they call it Happy Grill. =P"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and they knocked it out of the park. Great place to go for lunch and I wouldn't mind trying the breakfast."}
{"text":"Small 8 table place with a counter. Perfect example of a real diner. Small breakfast/lunch menu.
I'm not sure if I had a different experience than the others reviewers or what,  but our service was pretty slow and very inattentive. We had to flag down our server to get a drink refill. All the tables were full and the two cooks were pretty busy on a small grill, so food didn't come out very fast either.
The food was mediocre. It wasn't any better than some of the chains, which was disappointing. Perhaps I expected too much from a small diner.I wouldn't avoid this place, but I won't go out of my way to come here either."}
{"text":"At first glance, you probably think this is a Chinese take-out. It's actually more like a simple lunch counter, and that's a great thing. We need more of these around, because there aren't too many left.

Now it's not a fancy lunch counter by any means - and if you don't like to watch your food being prepared, or the person preparing it, and want to be pampered, this is not your place. But if you like plain and simple cooking, and a good, friendly neighborhood joint that can provide just about anything - I mean the guy is right in front of you, just ask him to change what he's doing - then this is the spot.

Definitely great for lunch, probably good for breakfast (haven't tried it yet though), and not sure if they are even open for dinner. Still, it makes me happy knowing they are there. See what I did there?"}
{"text":"No place like Happy's.  Sit at the counter if you can. Give Leo a fist pump and he is your personal chef.  Great food, consistent, and the name describes it best, a Happy environment.  My daughters love it.  He puts Mickey Mouse ears on the pancakes, by request only according to my 8 yr old."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg and livermush English muffin. My first experience with livermush and it did not disappoint. Service was quick and friendly and prices were excellent. Only complaint was the coffee, tasted like your standard all day on the burner diner coffee. Overall, a recommend."}
{"text":"Owner is super friendly, the staff is wonderful! The service here is completely 5 stars. Food is very well priced. Chocolate milk, OJ, pancakes and French toast are all so good!"}
