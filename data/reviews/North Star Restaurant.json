{"text":"NEVER Again!  To Begin, I thought smoking in a restaurant within Allegheny county was outlawed years ago....not at this place... My family including my 7 year old left smelling like an ashtray and we were coughing the rest of the night....GROSS!  All items we ordered were overcooked, tables were filthy and the jukebox on our table ripped us off.  Don't waste your time, unless you like your food with a side or cigarettes."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere in the Tiki area! This is our favorite place to meet up with a group in the summer. The outside area is perfect for group happy hours and provides FREE corn hole, volleyball and a swing the ring on the hook(?) type game. We stumbled upon their hoagies during a happy hour this summer and these hoagies are hands down the best around. The hoagies are huge and always served on fresh Mancini's bread. The Penn Lincoln and Italian are our favorites. We call in an order to pick up  at least once a month. If you order a whole hoagie it's enough for 2!"}
{"text":"Service lately has been terrible. Still a good place to eat,hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"Do not judge this bar by the outside!! 

Might look like a dive neighborhood bar from the outside (which the inside fits that bill) but the OUTSIDE is like Summer Camp/tropical get-a-way. Huge bar, tiki paviliion, picnic tables, SAND VOLLEY, Corn hole!!! 

Beer and Volleyball? Sold. 

They also have quite a large menu on the cheaper side too! Grub and Booze and pretend like you aren't in the burgh! 

I just wish it wasn't all the way in Imperial!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The portions are absolutely huge and the entire staff does there best too welcome you with happiness. The portions are HUGE and the food is delicious and very well priced. The ambience is a bar setting but all are welcome. If it's a beautiful day the outside tiki hut is amazing with volleyball and many games to play."}
{"text":"Good service, wanted to go golfing after but unfortunately we had a downpour just as we finished eating.  I had the crab cakes which where not fresh but frozen.  For the price I wasn't too surprised at that.  Will try different food next time as it seems like a nice place.  Other people at my table got burgers which looked much better!  It is also a Pokestop which I won't lie, is a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"We recently ordered wings to go there and they were very meaty wings and very delicious.  The only downfall is they don't come with celery and you have to ask for blue cheese, which was inadvertently omitted from our order.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Check out the Tiki Hut!  Lots of fun!  
Beach volleyball, corn hole and a nice bar with picnic tables.

The menu has Hoagies, burgers, Pizza and a few other items.

I was told the pizza is good.  Had a Pepperoni Pizzaburger that was good!.  !/2 lb. burger on a toasted hoagie bun with a tomato sauce that had some nice spiciness, cheese and pepperoni (Yes it was huge).  It came with fries that were crisp and good."}
{"text":"Love the tiki area!  Food tasted good & was a good price. Drink prices comparable to other bars in the area. Fun little mini golf course"}
