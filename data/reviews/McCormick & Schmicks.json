{"text":"Let's just say less than stellar experience.   Salmon smelled like it had sat on a counter for 8 hours.  Service was uninspiring.  Do yourself and your pocketbook a favor, stay away."}
{"text":"I've had better seafood at STEAK restaurants. This was a huge letdown of an experience. The mussles were pretty disgusting and couldn't even compare to other seafood restaurants.  I can't imagine this will be in business for much longer."}
{"text":"We have stopped in at McCormick & Schmick's many times, usually when we go to Cedar Lee Theatre or Beachwood Place. In all other cases, we have ordered a seafood meal and it has been decent. But that was last year. Let's talk about now. 2009, early spring. Looking at the menu on a cold Sunday early afternoon, many items sounded good. We thought we would sample the meat on the menu. Just for argument's sake. There's not much, but it's featured in a box off to the side. So you might naturally think, well, it must be edible. If you think this, you would be wrong. Look at the menu. Check the wine list. You will see two different sizes of wine pours, 5 oz. and 8 oz. Nobody we observed ordered the 5 oz. You must look at that list, otherwise the server (in our case, Kristi) will never mention you are going to be paying the higher price. A couple glasses of an average wine (Chateau St. Jean, for instance) can easily set you back $14 plus tax and tip. Let's call it $18, shall we? Move on to the entrees. We ordered a dozen oysters, ostensibly fresh. $19.95. Marginal. No side plates, lemon, oyster crackers, or hot sauce were offered. Grit in every single mollusk, plus they were not released from the shell, a nicety I consider essential. We had to ask for every one of those normal sides. My water was only refilled upon request. I also had to request that water twice. When we entered the place, the not-too-busy employees were clustered around the front desk, gossiping, and there they stayed the whole time we were there. Unsavory. The ladies' room soap dispensers were both out of soap. We tried the \"slow roasted prime rib\" at $19.95. I searched that menu with a fine tooth comb. What were some possible vegetables I could have to round out the plate? Potatoes, french fries, potato croquettes (fried) and cole slaw. Iceberg lettuce. It was a vast wasteland of whiteness. No side veg was offered except for a wan ramekin of bland black beans. And bland is putting it nicely. I'm being polite here. After loading on the salt and hot sauce (I waited about ten minutes to get Kristi's attention so I could request it) , they were barely edible. Normally, the prime rib is accompanied by a baked potato with \"the fixin's\" More bland. More whiteness. Or something fried. There was a lone field greens salad on the menu. Try a little, people. The prime rib arrived. No au jus (it was mentioned on the menu but was not on the plate), a tablespoon of horseradish sauce badly in need of seasoning, and three lonely wrinkled asparagus spears topped with a tablespoon of grossly undercooked eggplant cubes. We were splitting the prime rib, and barely nibbled around the edges, it was so dry and tough. Inedible. What happened to you guys, M and S? I know you have to meet your food cost, but an all-potato and all-fried side dish menu? They are also touting the farm raised seafood, which I do not favor. I don't care for Tilapia, farmed salmon or shrimp, or the rest of the farmed seafood family. It all has \"that taste.\" Service was sloppy and half hearted. We will go back to try again, maybe, but I do not recommend the prime rib."}
{"text":"Overcooked black grouper served with cold mixed green bean medley...I ordered the chefs special-bad idea! The fish was overcooked and topped with a crab cheese sauce-yuck! To make matters worst, the fish was...very fishy! I sent it back and opted for a lackluster crab watercress salad with fennel & oranges. It was better but \"forgettable\".  VERY OLD REVIEW from last year."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour between 3:30PM & 6:30PM. Happy hour is only in the bar area on selected items, but two can eat and have drinks for about $15-$20. Cannot beat this anywhere!!  The atmosphere is nice but the bar area is a bit small so bring someone you don't mind being a bit closer to."}
{"text":"Late evening with a good friend, an order of mahi mahi and an order of Chilean sea bass; Two glasses of wine imbibed - in an institution of the American Mall:  McCormick and Schmick's.    The meal was decent, though a tiny bit heavy - my sea bass was dripping with its omega-3 rich fish oil, and probably a moderate amount of butter.  The rice was laden with scallions and a light cheese.  Service was passable, though a bit ... snide.  I didn't react well to the waitress' nasal tones nor her slightly stilted manner. Given that this might be a personal, one-off reaction, I can't really blame the venue.  Decor is reminiscent of all the standard steak-house derived from the 1950s.  Still, it's passable."}
{"text":"Good food and service, the music was the worst part. Madonna and some other really cheesy pop rock does not meet the decor or food. Food was worth it though. I had the Wild Sea Scallops which were delicious, and beautifully prepared. I would also recommend the crab, shrimp and artichoke dip with pita chips for an appetizer, very tasty indeed. Service was fast and friendly. Again I would have given 5 stars if the music was more pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was top notch. I think this may have been due to the fact that they remembered me because due to a few \"Issues\" they wrote off our dinners the last time we were in."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner here. I had steak and it was cook perfectly. I also had potato croquet ( probably not spelled right) but they were great. Service was friendly, and prices were pretty good. My husband had the rainbow trout and said it was the best fish he has ever had."}
{"text":"I have been to McCormick & Schmick's quite a few times myself and have to partially disagree with the other review on here. I probably visit this restaurant on average 2 to 4 times a month, mostly on the weekend's. I have always had a great server, and quick service. The food is a little pricey but you are paying for what you get. Sure there are some farm raised items but most things on the menu are brought in fresh every day and those items are the more expensive, there are plenty of affordable options with prices ranging from $8 to around $30, definitely something for everyone. The meat offerings are obviously not that of a steak place because well, it's a seafood restaurant. In my experience any problem that I may have had has been promptly addressed by the management. The menu changes every day so I don't see how mary can judge it from just one cold sunday afternoon. If you enjoy seafood then you will enjoy this place, the food is good, the atmosphere is engaging and they offer patio seating which is great for the upcoming warmer months"}
{"text":"I love McCormick & Schmicks.  Have eaten around the country.  This one may change my mind.  Terrible.  Did I say TERRIBLE.  Rude Manager, dirty, food poorly done, dirty.  TERRIBLE, Food fresh NOT This place should get a new manager and maybe it will improve."}
{"text":"Good for happy hour; Monday to Friday from 3:30 to 6 pm they offer plates ranging from $1.95 to $4.95.  The only stipulation about happy hour is that you have to buy some sort of drink to get the discounts.  We tried a myriad of happy hour plates, and the general consensus was that the best things we had on the menu were the pot roast sliders and the steamed mussels.  In general, you get a fair value for what you pay for.  For instance, the $1.95 taco was really not that good.  The taco juices had all leaked through one side of the taco, making it impossible to pick up so I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  The fish itself didn't seem too fresh, and actually tasted fishy.  But for $1.95, what do you expect?  On the other hand, the more expensive mussels for $3.95 were very tender, in a light white wine/garlic broth that complimented the mussels well.  We also came here on oyster night (Tuesdays 6-9, $1 oysters).  Once again, a fair value for what you pay.  The oysters were pretty small, and tasted just ok.  I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"What a bad rap M & S is getting.  I usually hit this place for happy hour because as John states 'it's excellent\"!  Cheeseburgers for 2.95!  Everything else ranges from 1.95 to 6.95 but well worth it.  There are beer and wine specials too.  Don't be surprised to find an infused vodka behind the bar either.  I've only eaten dinner there once and the food was really good.  My 5 star rating is really for the happy hour.  It IS as good as it gets price wise.  The Mussels were huge...ha ha, the wings are good, onion rings are wonderful, flat bread pizza is delicious, but the meatballs are where its at.  Those things are worth returning for and at 1.95, c'mon!!"}
{"text":"OK. A good place to take your Mom or Gran. Nothing exciting. No surprises, good or bad. The atmosphere is swanky and the food isn't bad.   I had scallops, which were done nicely-- crisp on the outside, not exactly egg white consistency in the middle, but pretty close. The sushi app was rather mushy. Their version of a mojito-- topped with dark rum-- was very good. Everyone at the table thought the food was good enough. No raves, but no complaints.   They have two children's menu sections. The lower priced one contains your standard burger, chicken fingers or grilled cheese. The slightly more expensive on had selections like grilled salmon and rice, for older or more adventurous kids. My daughter liked her salmon, although it looked a bit dry. She also liked that the waiter brought her Shirley temples with extra cherries!   Desserts were nice-- the usual creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake and a tasty upside down apple pie."}
