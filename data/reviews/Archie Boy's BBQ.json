{"text":"I moved here last year from Austin, and I've really been missing Texas-style brisket. Well, let me tell you, I found it at Archie Boy's. It's just like I remember it and it's incredible. The brisket has that perfectly-rendered fat and the bark is amazing. It was super moist and requires no sauce (like any properly-smoked meat). Archie was a great guy to talk to as well. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This guy just knows how to cook Texas style Bar B Q. His brisket is the bomb and his pulled pork is divine. Archie is very friendly and personable and you can tell he has a passion for his business. I've eaten Bar B Q all over the country and this is hands down the best. Only downside is that Archie is a Dallas Cowboys fan."}

{"text":"We hired Archie to cater a party for about 50 people.  He was responsive, on time, priced great and very customer friendly!  The food was also great and we got many compliments. I would definitely hire him again or highly recommend his food and services."}
