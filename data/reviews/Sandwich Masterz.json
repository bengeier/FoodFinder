{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Not only do the have a large selection of fresh sandwiches, they also offer gluten free bread or can turn any sandwich into a salad bowl for those of us with a gluten sensitivity. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We just moved to Goodyear and stopped in to try this place. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The food is amazing probably the freshest ingredients I have had on a sandwich,and the bread is amazing! They are busy we went at lunch time but we got our food in no time! We will defiantly be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a gourmet sandwich shop that offers something for almost everyone then this is an excellent place to dine.  The menu can be a little confusing if you are used to Subway that has the same sandwiches and lacks diversity. The choices of sandwiches with fresh ingredients and even vegan and vegetarian options is extensive.  Great find on yelp and be sure to check out their extensive menu before arriving to avoid having to waste time once you arrive.  No better place in the West Valley for a gourmet homemade quality sandwich with extensive variety, friendly staff, reasonable prices.  Located in the Safeway shopping center next to the Goodyear Animal Hospital.  Check out the other 125 positive reviews and photos of some of the sandwiches and salads!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place! Quality all natural ingredients, very large selection of food, and the service was fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Phoenix. I go here weekly and try everything. Lots of vegan options as well. Perfect place to grab a sandwich before a Spring Training game. Military discount as well. Great staff"}
{"text":"Ordered 11 sandwiches for all of our employees. Everyone including me loved them! We had them deliver to our office and they were right on time! Thank you for the yummy lunch and the happy employees!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome 
Food is the best
They have a breakfast sandwich that is not on the menu that is the best 
No one else has a sandwich like this"}
{"text":"Had a vegetarian sandwich today # 34. It was not good. The tomato was not ripe the cucumbers were sliced in big chunks. The pesto was very good. The whole wheat bread was chewy like it was kept in plastic bag not that that is a bad thing it's just not expected from a sandwich shop. Crunchy outside soft inside. I was really hoping for a great sandwich for the money but was very disappointed since this shop is on my way home from work. Great service though so I might try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Sandwich Masterz is up the street from me but it is well hidden and I didn't even know it was there until recently. I ordered from there today via Uber eats and it was super quick. I ordered the lunch size Starvin Marvin and it came with a bag of chips and a Snapple for under 10.00. (Not including Uber eats fee) It was absolutely delicious!!! The turkey was so thin it was like it was shredded and the avocado was so yummy. The sandwich was warm and just perfect. I regret that it's this close to me and it's my first time trying it. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Great local shop with great sandwiches! Tried them for dinner last night and was back for lunch today. Over 100+ sandwiches for all types of eaterz."}
{"text":"Once again, my family enjoyed their sandwiches for dinner. Every time we eat there, we order something different. Their pastrami is the best I've ever had, their prime rib cheesesteak is delicious! My daughter enjoys every chicken sandwich she has tried & my son loves their meatballs! If you live or work in the West Valley or are in town for Spring Training, you need to go to Sandwich Masterz!!"}
{"text":"Love supporting local small business! The owner is very friendly! Food was great! I had the italian on sourdough bread. Make sure you get masterz sauce on whichever sandwhich you choose to get. Will be back for sure. Hope to see this place stick around ,  because I live so close and its that good!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the buffalo chicken, high quality meat and great bread. We also had tha pastrami Rueben another great sandwich.  I can't wait to come back and try more. They have over 147 sandwiches.  Very good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Been there twice and both sandwiches were superb. Fresh ingredients, loads of options, great bread selection. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you are into warm, delicious, creamy Reuben sandwiches, sandwich masterz is the place.   I am a sandwich lover and I grade a sandwich shop by the quality of their Reuben.  SM's Reuben is packed with Sauerkraut (not the highly acidic stuff that u find on a grocer store shelf), non-oily thousand Island, and delicate corned beef.  The Reuben is finished with melty Swiss between the classic marlbed rye. 

Friendly service, great sandwiches, reasonable prizes."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, food is all natural and really great, I have to say traveling out to goodyear as it is nice to have some great food.  I recommend going here it is awesome"}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Meat and veggies are fresh. Think Quiznos, but way better. Had the prime rib melt, so great! Can't miss here!"}
{"text":"Really, really, really good! The menu is a bit overwhelming. There are over 100 different sandwich or salad choices. So just take a paper menu, sit down and take some time to figure out what you want. The staff is very friendly and helpful and can make some wonderful suggestions. They also use really high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough good things about this place. It is hands down the best sandwich shop I ever been to in my life. The quality of the food they serve is unmatched. This place completely blows all other sandwich shops in the area out of the water. Their customer service is impeccable. They use all natural ingredients, which is really nice because I always feel like I get my money's worth every time I eat here. The have so many different options, it will probably take a year to try them all!

If you feel overwhelmed by the menu, start off with the Garlic peppercorn cheesesteak with mushrooms, the buffalo chicken or the perfect blend sandwich with avocado and masterz sauce. Can't really lose with those. Make sure you try the masterz sauce on the side. I have tried over 20 sandwiches from here and I haven't had a bad one yet! Don't make the mistake of ordering something super basic the first time you come, it might skew your view on how truly remarkable this place is. 

Giving this place a try will absolutely be a pleasant experience. If this review helps you decide to go there, tell them that Bryce sent you!"}
{"text":"Another great yelp find! Prices just a tad higher than Subway, but their sandwich selection is crazy! Well worth literally pennies more! Had the Thanksgiving Delight; my husband had The Godfather. Mine was turkey, cranberry, and cream cheese. Warm. Really good. Only comment I would make is that the cranberry is a little too sweet. Doesn't have that bite. Husband finished too fast for a pic of his sammie."}
{"text":"I was having trouble choosing what to order for myself and my beloved bae, so I called and asked what the three most popular sandwiches were. The employee on the phone stated that the Italian, the Garlic Peppercorn Cheesesteak, and the Starvin' Marvin were the three that came to mind. I ordered the first two, but decided to replace the Marvin with the Sandwich Police because it looked way more interesting. 
The Italian is solid. If I were on the go and had to order something from a sandwich shop I'd never been to before, I'd likely order the Italian sub and judge the establishment based on that sub alone. Here it's simple, flavorful, and satisfying as it ought to be.
The Peppercorn Cheesesteak (the one with prime rib) was heaven. Just order it. Really, this should be their flagship. Very few people would not enjoy this sandwich by my estimation. My better half enjoyed his half so much he's made a resolution to go there and get one all for himself some time.
The Sandwich Police was my personal favorite of the three! I love a good mix of savory and sweet, and the tang from the cranberries was so nice and unexpected. I'm definitely getting something with cranberries again, or perhaps one of the sandwiches with pineapple. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I am already planning my next trip back. Ordered the little gorilla it was amazing! The food is so fresh and it is all good quality ingredients. The service is fantastic. This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and I loved it! I had the Good Intentions Sandwich with cheddar. Mouth watering, fulfilling and I tasted every delicious bite of the turkey and ham. It helps that their meats are all natural and the ingredients are fresh! The employees were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I will be returning very soon and recommend this place to all Sandwich lovers out there."}
{"text":"If you love sandwiches you need to try this place. Everyone at our table loved their sandwiches which we were told are made out of all natural meat. In addition to the great sandwiches the staff treats you as if you are dining at a full service restaurant without the costs. Great  we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Worst sandwich ever. I thought I was getting a Veggie turkey bacon BLT w/. Avocado.  There was almost nothing on the sandwich...no lettuce, no tomatoes...a tiny slice of avocado....inedible and expensive.
On another note the other person I was with ordered the large Italian and it was good, but still overpriced. 
Based on this experience I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is just outstanding I can not say enough about the quality of the food and service so happy to support this business on the west side"}
{"text":"Okay... This spot really deserves 5 stars, customer service is great, sandwiches are fantastic, and there is nothing like this place out (far) West. Just stay consistent.... Strong work!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich, excellent service. I wasn't sure what to expect and since I tend to be indecisive the menu was a little overwhelming. HOWEVER I managed to choose and ordered the Honey Pot, it was wonderful! I also got an iced tea which was nice and fresh brewed. Found this place on Yelp since I don't live around here, passed Jimmy John's on my way but decided to give this place a try. I'm glad I did, YUM!"}
{"text":"Candle in the Window is the best sandwich I've ever had. My whole family enjoyed their sandwiches too. The next two days my youngest son asked to go back. 

The freshest ingredients are what make these sandwiches so delicious. There are so many choices of sandwiches that whatever combination you can think of exists on their menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on accident, but completely glad I did! Not only do they have a plethora of sandwich options, but they're customizable as well. They offer GF Udis bread which didn't crumble or get soggy! The meat and veggies are fresh and delicious and the pricing is reasonable. Highly recommend sandwich masterz for lunch anytime!"}
{"text":"My brother told me about this place and told me they have fantastic sandwiches. I come in and look over the menu, tons of options. I decide to go with the Italian since that's usually my favorite type. All I needed was one bite to tell me this place isn't lying about their quality. Best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"I am actually angry that they don't have a location in California. 
They were busy but were appropriately apologetic and very upfront about the wait, it was worth the wait! My husband and I both got the vegan pyramid (the gentleman at the register was great about letting us know what was vegan and what was not). The combination of flavors was AWESOME. 
The kids got The Silly Song and The Starvin Marvin and even though we left 10 minutes ago they're still talking about how good they were. 

When we come back this is a must go!

Thanks for a great experience and an epic sandwich"}
{"text":"I have always been searching for a good sandwich shop somewhere in the valley and I have finally found it.  I have been twice and both times the sandwich was excellent.  They have a huge variety of sandwiches and everything tastes fresh like you made it at home.  Both times I also have received excellent customer service from all of the employees.  They even offered a free drink and cookie for a mistake on the order without me even asking.  Def the best sandwich shop in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwiches. Incredible list of options, meats, breads and all natural meats / not the processed stuff sold at most shops. Love it"}
{"text":"Chose from over 127 different sandwiches . Different sizes. Make it a combo with chips and a drink. For our first time everything was great. Employees are very nice and working hard the lady who helped us was very nice and helped us out alot. Receipt says her name was Cas. They do have a kids menu their meal comes with chips drink and a cookie. They are Vegan friendly if your into that. I ordered The One it's turkey salami ham and American cheese. Next time I'm gonna order The Big Italian. Don't let the big menu scare you! Resturant is clean the soda machine area is very clean as well which is a major plus!  Keep up the good work guys! See ya next time"}
{"text":"My go-to spot especially when I'm sick and can't cook. I have a food intolerance so it's important for me to eat fresh foods low in histamines. This place is thee greatest, Subway can't touch this! The staff is always on point, helpful and the place is clean and quiet. The meats are flavorful and un-processed!! Which is a major reason why I eat here that and the veggies are always crisp and zesty which makes the Vegan menu phenomenal. They have like over a 100 sandwiches check them out!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for our family!   The service was over the top friendly and the sandwiches were the best we've ever had! 
The gentleman kindly explained how uniquely prepared these sandwiches are.... 100% natural, right off the bone! No processing, preservatives, nitrates, etc. The bread melted in your mouth, the meat was so full of real flavor. 
Tons of options for people who have particular allergies, vegan sandwiches, gluten free.... You name it! 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Expensive, greasy, childs pizza was not pleasant at all.  The tomatoe sauce was very sour, and unseasoned.    The manager made it right by replacing with a different sandwich.   However, he felt the need to keep explaining and telling me basically every kid loves the pizza!

Didn't meet our expectations,"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and a HUGE menu to chose from. Almost overwhelming. I look forward to trying more the their outstanding sandwiches in the near future.

Only complaint is that the sides of potato salad and macaroni salad are very small. The online menu says \"Full Size $2.50\" but when I order it I get a couple bites for $1.00. I asked the owner and he had no idea what I was talking about \"full size\" and said they only offered the $1.00 size."}
{"text":"best sandwiches i have tried in a while. friendliest staff, best quality that you can taste. try the cookie sundae!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Very courteous.  My toddler is a very picky eater.  Got him the pizza and he didn't want it.  They made him a peanut butter & jelly sandwich....he ate some of it.  Both were good, he's just being a little brat.  Anyway, will definitely come back....sans the kid"}
{"text":"sound these guys on Yelp.  Menu is a bit overwhelming as they have over 100 options.  I had the pastrami and was presently surprised...I just wished there just a bit more meat..  I need to go back and try a few others as the jury is still out, but I will be back"}
{"text":"Great place. Fresh products and excellent service definitely beats the corporate competition. Also has plenty more options as far as sandwiches go.. it'd be pretty hard not to find something you like here."}
{"text":"First, let me preface . . . We love Sandwich Masterz!
We've had AMAZING delights - like their Italian sub (NOT TO BE MISSED)
That being said . . . today was not their day! I know, it's bound to happen but honesty I didn't think it would happen here.
I ordered \"2\" things 
1. Turkey / cranberry and provolone on Gluten Free bread. Switched out the cream cheese for provolone
2. Turkey / bacon sub with provolone, black olives and their yummy MasterZ sauce
Sounds pretty simple but when I got home I found no gluten free bread on # 1 and the olives and MasterZ sauce and cheese were missing on # 2
Not to mention there was very little turkey on both.
We love to support local businesses and we will be back there for sure . . . but next time I'll be sure to check my order"}
{"text":"This place us really awesome!  Great service by the employees and the best sandwich I've had in a very long time. I got the Sandwich Masterz sandwich and holy wow it was delicious!  Definitely will be back in when I come through Goodyear again."}
{"text":"I found them on a catering site where they got great reviews. 
I was looking for a place to cater a party of about 45 people and decided to go and try a sandwich. It was definitely top notch! 
The meats are high end. No junk. The bread especially the sourdough is great. 

I had them cater the party and the guests we swooning over the ham and BBQ chicken sandwiches. The potato and macaroni salads were great too. 

I highly recommend Sandwich Masterz for an everyday meal or catering needs."}
{"text":"This ain't Subway.  That's for sure.   Ordered the \"Perfect Blend\"  turkey, bacon, pastrami and roast beef with extra meat.  Easily 2 meals here.  Each meat was distinct and tasteful.  I'm kind of a meat snob and typically stick with Boarshead products.  These meats did not disappoint.   Called in a several sandwich order and order taker was courteous and knowledgeable.  I was actually confidant they would get everything right and they did.   Upon pick up,  observed courteous staff and they all seemed to give a shit.  Best sandwich option for miles."}
{"text":"Sandwich Masterz definitely lived up to the reviews.  I visited for the first time today and got three sandwiches to share between four people.  The sandwiches were a generous size and all three were very good (meatball, garlic peppercorn steak and Reuben).  When I walked in I was greeted right away and given a menu. The man (I assume was owner but don't know) explained how they make everything and that all the meat is fresh and without preservatives.  I will definitely be back because there are so many more sandwiches to try!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and subs.  Incredible selection.  After many visits and many different sandwiches I have yet to find one I did not like.  If you live in the Far West valley don't miss this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Really good portions.Food taste great and guys behind the counter take time to explain the sandwiches and what they consist of. Definitely going to make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant ever since they open. It is such an amazing place and the variety of sandwiches is overwhelming. Aside from that, the customer service is absolutely impeccable. They go out of their way to make sure you are getting the perfect sub just for you and every sub we've had at this restaurant is better than any sub we've had anywhere else. It has been a gift to have a place like this to go to with such variety and is so different than the regular subs shops that just offer a few choices. Obviously, I really can't say enough as they are truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Great local /small business in Goodyear with great sandwiches and so many delicious options (even ahem vegetarian options, not that is pick one).  So far we've loved each meal here and wife loves the Ruben and I'm partial to the Italian and the prefect match (I think that's what's is called)."}
{"text":"I have pretty high standards when it comes to quality, great tasting food. Customer service while important is usually the last detail I care about. Had the luck of coming across this amazing sandwich shop on Yelp. I got the Italian. It was bomb!! Plenty of quality meats, ingredients, and flavors. And the customer service xp I received from Cass (sry if I misspelled) was first class. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally a great sandwich shop in the west valley!!! Don't like the processed meat at the other sub shops in the area...... you all know who they are!!! Really enjoying the natural thing, (except the meatball sub )  which your menu does mention."}
{"text":"I've never been happy with the amount of bacon I receive on sandwiches, until now. So much bacon. This place is great!!!!"}
{"text":"I was overwhelmed by the number of choices that I just went with my go to - an Italian sub. The bread was good and they are generous with the meat. I found the sides to be on the small side. There was a steady flow of customers the whole time I was there. I will definitely be back to try some of the other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Our men's group at Church met here for breakfast on Saturday. Kaz made the best breakfast sandwiches for us. Their menu is huge with 140+ sandwiches, some classics, some very unique. I came home raving about this place and my wife and daughter decided to go their for lunch. They loved it too! My daughter especially liked that they offer their sandwiches on gluten free bread, and it is good bread without an up-charge. Most sandwiches places don't offer gluten free bread, and if they do, the bread is usually small and not very good. Since she has a wheat allergy it is very hard to get a sandwich at a restaurant or sandwich shop. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sandwiches are killer and they have numerous types. Highly recommend this place and the owner and his staff treat their customers With respect."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh deli. They have many options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores! We came here based on yelp reviews and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a regular size shop. They do have seating available outside. 

OMG I can't believe their menu it's huge! There's 146 sandwhich choices!!! How can they remember all of them omg!!! That's why they are called the sandwhich masterz I guess!!!"}
{"text":"Been addicted to this place since it opened!  The owner, Kez is awesome!  Always making sure you're satisfied with your sandwich. Every sandwich I've tried so far has been amazing!  I. Going down the list and gonna try em all!  

You won't be disappointed with this establishment!  \"I guarantee it\" ( men's wear house voice)..."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich. All the meat is cooked there and all the cheese except the American is natural. Really good quality bread, meat , cheese, toppings and the service is excellent. I had the Rueben which was huge! The pastrami was excellent. My husband had the ham, turkey and beef it had a lot meat which was delicious and obviously high quality. There are a ton of sandwich choices. Next time looking forward to trying the prime rib. Love supporting a small business owner who has such a good product and great"}
{"text":"Third time here at this sandwich shop and they are consistently delicious. They aim for having fresh ingredients, for example of the 5 or so cheeses the only one with any preservatives was the American cheese. Now I'm a patriotic person but I don't do American. The lunch size sandwich was plenty for me each time, as there is a generous portion of meat. They also have a number of vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"I was so pleased to see soooooo many vegan options!!! Many choices to chose from that can match any craving really! The customer service was AMAZING!! I felt so welcomed and you could tell they wanted to make sure you had everything you needed. One of the managers took the time to converse with us and get our feed back! We will be back again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Love their extensive selection of Vegan choices.  The sandwiches are huge and very fresh.  You might have to wait a bit longer than your typical franchised sandwich places, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely, ridiculously delicious. Three glorious words: Peanut Butter Shake. More to come on the review."}
{"text":"Seeing everyone's reviews my daughter and I decided to try it out.  There honestly wasn't anything we liked about this place and we were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Second time here and it didn't disappoint at all! Quality fresh food you can taste. Very helpful and friendly staff. I will be frequenting this sandwich stop."}
{"text":"Great place for meat eaters and veggie heads. my wife and I never can find a place equally as good for both our tastes. Now we have. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Oh my glob!! Sooooo many delicious choices!!! The menu has over 100 sandwiches, which you can make a salad if you like. The place is small, and not flashy at all.  The menus are hand written on chalkboards and classified by meat, veggie, or vegan.
*WARNING* The 8 inch sandwich is mega.  I barely got through half. 
The gentleman at the register was super nice and checked on us several times.  I can't wait to go back and try the warm cookie sundae."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches on the Westside! Definitely would recommend to anybody who lives over on the west side especially Goodyear go check them out."}
{"text":"This place is new and a nice touch to the Goodyear area! Good sandwiches nice selection we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"They have over one hundred different sandwiches. I asked for a cheese steak bit the cashier recommended another cheese steak type of sandwich made with a ribeye and some some garlic sauce. She had me at ribeye. It was delicious with just a slight hint of spice. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time there was nice. My husbands sandwich ended up being $19 and some change.. which I think is something the cashier should let you know before giving you your total...since they're no visible prices. I got the Thanksgiving Delight and it was pretty good. I'd definitely go back to try some different sandwiches. The staff is nice and an employee even gave my son a free cookie. Super nice!"}
{"text":"The options are unbelievable! The crew was friendly and patient with newcomers. They explained their menu to us gave some recommendations and made delicious sandwiches. I got sweet chicken in a spinach wrap and it was scrumptious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious Sandwiches with preservative free meats and freshly baked bread! Definitely impressed and will be back frequently."}
{"text":"My son has eaten here several times with his dad and said it was amazing. 
The service was great. My son is a little picky so he created his own sandwich. My sandwich was warm and delicious.
I wild come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow first time there and so happy. I only had one wrap and it's was prefect.  Like made in heaven the meat was super fresh. I couldn't stop dipping my wrap in the green sauce. It's so good. I can't wait to go back and try another sandwich. And the owner, I didn't catch his name but he was extremely nice."}
{"text":"I really like this sandwich shop! The ingredients they use are a higher quality than your average sandwich shop; has more of a gourmet taste. They have gluten free options, dairy free and vegan!! They always ask if I want their equipment wiped down due to my allergy; really nice folks! Im giving them a 4 star instead of a 5 star because they didn't put mustard on both sides of my sandwich and I wasn't asked if I wanted my bread toasted. I will remember to ask next time. There are coupons in in the leaflet we receive in the mail about once a month. The prices are a bit higher, but if you lean towards a clean eating lifestyle; you will be more than happy to pay for quality good. Check this place out!! Oh, ps--they have kids meals that includes a sandwich, chips, medium drink and a cookie bar for only $5!!"}
{"text":"Being that I have lived in Goodyear since the late 1990s I love to support local businesses. As I walked into the restaurant I was greeted by very friendly employees and a very friendly manager. I was observing the interactions between the manager and the employees and after a few moments, I became very disturbed. The manager was visibly irritated and not patient at all with the employee that was in training. I understand his frustration because I heard the whole story however I just think that with proper training the manager would not have to speak to employees in a disrespectful way. I could tell that the manager just wanted to ensure that I, as the customer was happy. However, after reviewing the company I read that they hire individuals with disabilities and military veterans so it made me even more sad to see the employee getting talked down to. I did mention my concerns to the manager before I left. The food was great! All the employees did a fantastic job, I would just work on training and teamwork."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in the southwest valley.  The pastrami is the bomb.  Small business owner pays great attention to the customer."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Passing through saw the good reviews, it definitely was worthwhile. Prime rib sandwich is amazing! Staff was helpful with the huge menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times. The menu is so big there is no way a person could go in and not find something that would fit their tastes. Today I ordered the No Rules and added some condiments to suite the craving I needed to quench. Sooo so good: these sandwiches are massive and full of flavor. My husband got the Sandwich Master sandwich and was very pleased as well.

The only thing that was off for us during this trip is that the turkey on both of our sandwiches was dry. However, the overall sandwich taste and quality made the dryness forgivable.

I'd also like to mention that the owner (i believe he said he was the owner on one of our visits) is incredibly nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is my second day in a row, I can't seem to have enough. These sandwiches so far are AMAZING! So good Im licking the wrapper.  So now this is one of my regular spots... so delicious. Everyone I have come visit I bring them here. The staff is great and have I mentioned this food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple times and really love the food! Everything is fresh and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is is really really good. glad I finally found a dope sandwich place this far west because subway sucks and the firehouse subs in buckeye isn't as good as some other locations. So for sure come here and eat good stuff."}
{"text":"The delivery guy was super awkward, and didn't say hello or anything, just sort of stared at me like he'd never met a person before? I dunno. 

The food was a mixed bag of really good, just okay, and not good. My sandwich had undercooked bacon and unruled avocado on it, and the chicken was bone dry. But the other sandwiches we ordered were really good! Definitely ask them to add condiments to avoid the dryness!"}
{"text":"Veteran and locally owned shop, serving all natural meats and offering friendly service and 3-mile radius delivery. There are 150 sandwiches to try with an extensive vegetarian and vegan menu. I had The Italian with all the veggies on soft white. Definitely add the Masterz Sauce! It was AMAZING. The Honey Pot was awesome too. Owners offer a loyalty program and discounts for military, service professionals and teachers. NO MORE CHAIN SANDWICH SHOPS FOR US!"}
{"text":"Only been in a couple of times but it's amazing. The guy at the cash register has helped me every time by offering suggestions that are completely vegan and not just vegetarian. The food is so good that I'll probably make a weekly visit. I signed up for the loyalty program so I got 10% off today and $5 off for every $50 I spend. Great people, great food."}
{"text":"Best place ever! I love their commitment to their food and service! Veggie garden is my go to! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"My new sandwich and hunger destroyer choice! It is only five minutes from my apartment!"}
{"text":"I had the Garlic Peppercorn Cheese Steak sandwich. I have to say most of the reviews were right on target, in what a fantastic sandwich place it is. This sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I ever had in my life. If they are all as nearly as good, I will be coming back very frequently. The food was fresh and very tasty. Since they have over 150 sandwiches, there is one for everyones  taste. The owner was very personal and nice. I hope people will support this small business and this place thrives. Subway, Jersey Mikes and the other large chains sandwiches are pale in comparison to this place. I definitely would recommend this place and will visit again."}
{"text":"So excited to find a place where they have so many vegan options! The sandwiches are so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Bought A French dip on Sour Dough... Great Sandwich.. Also they have more to choose from than just chips for side items..."}
{"text":"I'm only half way through my first sandwich I've ordered from here, and I had to write this review immediately because it is sooooo delicious! As a non meat eater, it is so refreshing to see so many vegetarian and vegan options on a menu. There is something on this menu to appeal to anyone's tastes. Reasonably priced, especially for the quality and taste you are getting. Delivery is a huge plus! Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Doing Sandwiches Right

Today, we went to Sandwich Masterz for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Sandwich Masterz are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Sandwich Masterz is here.

We really enjoyed our first visit to Sandwich Masterz.  The menu has plenty of options, fillled with high quality meats, for the meat-eaters and a large selection of vegetarian & vegan options, if meat isn't your thing. 

Sandwich Masterz offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, cole slaw,  or chips, with a beverage.  Today, my lunch companions and I had the Pastrami and swiss on Sourdough, French Dip, and Prime Rib Melt and all were delicious.

My sister thought the Pastrami and swiss on Sourdough was some of the best she has had since she left the east coast, and I thought the French Dip was excellent. All of the breads at Sandwich Masterz are made fresh daily and you can tell with your first bite.  The sourdough was absolutely delicious, soft, crispy, everything that sourdough should be.  I can't wait to try some of the other bread options on my next visit.

The staff at Sandwich Masters were incredibly friendly, helpful, and accomdating. The menu was explained to us,  suggestions based on our  preferences were given, and we were even given a  complimentary sample of the Italian sandwich and hot chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream.

If your in the area give Sandwich Masyerz  a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, and the best customer service."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town; plethora of options available. Quality home style meats, plus complete vegetarian & vegan options available."}
{"text":"Super fresh, tasty sandwiches! If you can't find an option here, you have a problem, because the menu has 150 items and they all sound delicious! Nice and helpful owners as well...a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was so delicious and fresh!! Their masterz sauce is like heaven in my mouth! They have cookies firefighters made and they're amazing! We love that they support them! The staff was so nice and friendly and made our experience that much better! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place this weekend. Was looking for a good pastrami sandwich for my wife and didn't want to go to any of the chains. They were quick, delicious and they have something for everyone. Got the 8\" and had lots of meat. Also tried the Italian it was the best I've had in Phoenix. With over 100 possibilities of sandwich combinations you cannot go wrong here. It fast, clean, and delicious"}
{"text":"Came here with the whole family after the movies. Six kids, my wife and I, and grandma loved the food! Got the bruski and the razzle-dazzle and couldn't be more satisfied. Kids loved the food as well. I love that all the meat here is not processed or cold cuts or deli meat. All the meat is made in house and the chicken tastes like something I would roast in the oven at home. Glad we found this little gem right around the corner from us and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were on our way back to the valley from California and craving sandwiches and found this place on yelp.  When we walked in the place had an odd smell but we were helped by a nice guy who explained about how they use legit meats and everything is fresh.  We ordered 2 sandwiches, one with turkey, chicken and bacon (I think the word legacy was in the name somewhere), and the other with roast beef, pastrami and turkey.  Both sandwiches were really good and there is a list of toppings you can choose from that are all included.  I was really excited to see cucumbers as a veggie option because I love them on sandwiches and so few places offer them.  Sandwiches were great, service efficient.  The only thing that could have been better was if the place didn't have the unpleasant smell it had when we walked in."}
{"text":"While I'm not usually a fan of paying to have someone make me a sandwich; the quality of their ingredients and vast menu certainly make it worth it. Highly recommend their pepper corn prime rib steak sandwich."}
{"text":"They have a HUGE menu selection and they have vegan options! You get what you pay for here. The sandwich is like lunch and dinner for me. I really enjoyed my vegan meatball sandwich. I would totally go here again."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. Good food and service. My fav sandwich on the menu is the Caesar Love. I think their better than most of the Sandwich chains like Subway, JJ's, and Firehouse and they have a large menu of options to choose from. The combo for $1 more is also a good deal."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in and was not disappointed!  They have a huge menu, including vegetarian and vegan options!   I ordered The Bodycheck- chicken, honey mustard, avocado, jack cheese- it was delicious!  They used actual shredded chicken (yum! ) and a perfect amount of honey mustard.   Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"So good. Reviews were on point. You can't seem to go wrong with what your order. Best thing was their soda fountain had Ginger Ale."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great sandwiches and a cozy atmosphere make this a place worthy of its title-masterz!  Would recommend to anyone. Spread the word as these guys are new to the community and need our support!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I ordered the buffalo chix sandwich. It was a good size but there was way too much sauce on it. It completely took away from the other flavors. It also made the entire sandwich soggy. Couldn't eat it normally. Had to use a fork and knife. Probably won't come back.

Edit:
They gave a refund to someone they assumed was me."}
{"text":"So many delicious choices! My husband loves the Reuben as it reminds him of eating one back home. We've never been disappointed by our sandwich choices. Staff is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Went to this place driven by excellent reviews. Lots of types of sandwiches, both for meat lovers, vegetarians and anybody in between. Not sure what happened, got four different sandwiches and none of them were great. They're okay at best, nothing special. Will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The service here is truly exceptional. I was immediately welcomed in and given a short summary about the business. The man helping us was very knowledgeable. After eating our sandwiches (which were delicious) they even took our leftovers, rewrapped them, and sent them home with us to enjoy later. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by for dinner as I was eager to give this new spot a try. I was looking for a solid sandwich for dinner and boy did I find it. I ordered their Reuben as I wanted to try a fairly standard sandwich before I dived into their many, many, many other creative options (over 100). On a scale of 0 to 10, the Rueben was an easy ten. They provided many bread options, the meat as other reviews noted has no fillers, and it was just the right size. No joke, this boy can eat, and their sandwiches are deceivingly filling. My wife ordered the Italian and of course I gave it a try. Only for my yelpers friends of course. It was darn tasty and I do not even like Italians (the sandwich, not the people, I love all people :)) The staff working the shop were great. They were very helpful and loved to offer suggestions.  Overall, very good sandwiches and good people working there. Locals need to give this place some love for the shop to have a chance against the big boys."}
{"text":"What a great little sandwich shop on this side of town! Our sandwiches were fresh and they were very generous on their portions. We were even provided a piece of salami for our two pups. Customer service was fantastic. We took a menu so we can call in an order next time. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite sandwiches. I'm so happy there's things for everyone, as I'm vegan, and I can still go places with my omnivorous friends!
I always get the cherry vegan milkshake and the vegan treat (#113). 
I'm two miles away from their delivery zone but the people there as so nice that they said they can go the extra miles if they're not busy. They're also now on UberEats. It can get pretty busy at lunchtime but around 4-5pm, it's peaceful."}
{"text":"Great food!!!
Love the sandwiches there. Staff is always extremely nice. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, excellent service! The menu board is extensive and full options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. It's worth standing in line when it's busy."}
{"text":"So many great choices, the meats are great the breads are great, I had the Peppercorn CHeesesteak and it was delicious. this place is exactly what the west valley needed. Cant wait to try the other sandwiches on their menu."}
{"text":"Skip JJ's and whatever else is around and go here!  I went here last weekend and had my first Rueben ever.  It just melts in your mouth!  I wish I would have snapped a pic but it was gone pretty fast!.  My whole family left completely satisfied.  Cherry on top is the staff.  They are very knowledgeable and want you know know exactly what you are eating.  I have told all my west side friends to try this place."}
{"text":"Went here like many others based on reviews, was very disappointed, I was looking for a good meatball sandwich. After I ordered the sandwich I walked to the end of the counter and watched an employee come out of the back room with a hand full of frozen meatballs which he proceeded to put in a microwave. I new at that point I'd probably be disappointed and I was.
Not sure how they got so many great reviews, not sure if I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Got a couple ruebens here. Did it two different ways. 
Did t eat it there but ate them about 15 min later once we got home. 
Honestly wasn't that impressed.  The bread was very soggy and it was just \"ok\"
That being said, perhaps it was just the sauce and the kraut and waiting 15 minutes to eat it

The staff was overly nice.  Very excited about what they do and how they do it.  They were super helpful

I will come back and try something else as the reviews are really good"}
{"text":"Great little place. Friendly staff,  lots of choices,  100% all natural meats.   Delicious and yoy can feel good about eating it. Had #22, Starvin Marvin, turkey, swiss, bacon and avocado.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop I have eaten in a long time!!  Sandwiches are freshly made to order.  Our lunch meal was half of a sandwich which was plenty since they don't skimp on their meats or toppings.  I love that they have Vegetarian and Vegan options and plenty of them,  most places just offer lettuce and tomatoes as a vegetarian option (sad).  Can't wait to go back and try a different item on the menu!"}
{"text":"Vegan sandwiches.... Yas! I got the cheese steak with lettuce and pickle it was delicious. My husband got the vegan turkey wrap he was t as thrilled with the texture of the \"meat\" but we will be back . This place has such a wide variety of vegan options and they use quality vegan meats like Gardien. Thanks so much for providing Vegan options in the West Valley."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can eat these sandwiches. For one, they're so big that you practically have to eat it with a knife and fork. But that's not how you're supposed to eat a sandwich. So you end up having to lock yourself in a room at work so that people don't judge you and your near swine like eating method. The sandwich is so stuffed with goodness that it's bound to end up on your clothes and face. But who cares?? You're in a locked room where no one can judge you. Until you realize that the mustard you had to have is not going to come out of that shirt with spit and hope. You wonder what excuses you'll need to come up with to go back to Goodyear since you don't live anywhere near it. Which will inevitably mean using more gas. So now you're considered an anti social slob at your temporary office and people wonder why you insist on visiting if you're just going to hide in a locked room. Don't come here if you don't want this."}
{"text":"I love this little unknown gem! Friendly service and the sandwiches, AMAZING! And what a selection. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich, great fresh ingredients, huge vegan menu (not that I used it) and the folks are friendly and welcoming. Not too far off 10 so a quick enough stop. Good prices for great sandwhich!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We are new to the area and  I'm definitely a sandwich guy.  So I was super hyped about finding a legit sandwich shop close to home.  And Sandwich Masterz is LEGIT!!!!!  I try to eat decent and because of my hobbies my appetite is a bit bigger then the norm.   So when my sandwich was brought to my table and I saw the portion size I was ecstatic!!! Sandwichs are huge, menu is huge and the owners knowledge of his product is huge!!  And the macaroni salad is fantastic as well.  And they have a rewards program.  I could go on and on.  You could try your luck at a competitor, but you would be throwing away your money.  Fresh non processed ingredients make for an amazing meal!!!!!' We are definitely regulars here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this sandwich shop. So many choices didn't know what to choose happened upon it by mistake got a coupon  we took it in. Keep the good work on."}
{"text":"First time in here and WOW.....
The service was incredible and they truly have a sandwich for everybody. With over 100 sandwiches to choose from the choice was hard. My girlfriend who is also vegan LOVED her sandwich and all the options. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is a great new sandwich shop in the west Valley. The meat and cheese is all natural. They have vegan and vegetarian options.  They have lunch size and full size options. For $1.00 more, you get a side (potato salad, macaroni salad, Cole slaw or chips) and a drink. You can make any sandwich into a wrap or salad. I had the prime rib melt on a wheat wrap. The meat was tender and just the right portion. One of my kids had the Buffalo chicken sandwich. The sauce was a little spicy for her but it was still good. The other kids had ham and cheese. The bread is soft too.  We will be back! It was reasonably priced too.  Under  $50 for 6 of us."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich shop. Really good large fresh sandwiches,  friendly owner and staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and service. My daughter and I love going here and tell everyone we know to try it."}
{"text":"This place was okay. One thing I loved was that they had such an extensive vegan menu. I was surprised to see how much they offered. 

The customer service was great, and I like that they seem to focus on serving natural and fresh foods. Browsing through their Google reviews, they have stated that they go out of their way to hire individuals with disabilities and veterans, which I think is great. 

I ordered The Vegan Addict as a salad. I did thoroughly enjoy it, but it was pretty basic, so I would probably get something else instead. I actually typically don't like mock meats or cheeses, and I know that it can be hard to replicate them, but I think they did a great job with the vegan chicken. The bacon was also delicious. I believe they used the Lightlife brand, which is great, but if not it was something very similar. 

My boyfriend got a sandwich that I can't remember the name of, but it had Vegan Roast Beef, Chicken, and Cheddar. He said that the cheese was good, but he couldn't really taste anything besides that. 

We would both try this place again and get something else. Often when I eat at regular restaurants that offer vegan options, I worry that they will mix up the real and fake meat or etc. This restaurant seemed very knowledgable about their vegan options and I did not have to worry at all about that happening. 

Overall, I would definitely suggest this to anybody passing through the area."}
{"text":"It's not often I crave a sandwich but, this has changed since discovering Sandwich Masterz...Everything is fresh and natural...Definitely the most delicious best value and locally owned in a sea of fast food empty calorie restaurants... 

We stop at least twice a week...My Grandson calls it \"Healthy Subway\"...The meats are additive free...Bread baked daily...over a hundred creative choices on the menu...Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten and dairy free options..The Brilliant owner thought of everything including yummy gluten free cookies and non 'big brand' potatoes chips...A little more expensive because of the quality...you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Need a little more room to handle the lunch crowd. The Ruben was excellent, portions are above average and price was fair. Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Sandwich Masterz for the first time and it was DELICIOUS!!! Had the 'lunch size' Veggie Garden sandwich and it was not only delicious, it was also enormous! I ordered it on the soft French roll, and added banana peppers and extra avocado. The Masterz sauce is super yummy, and the sandwich was loaded with super fresh veggies and lots of really green lettuce. The owner's husband was there, and it's always fun to support local, and meet the owner! :) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! These guys know how to make a fresh perfect sandwich, been here a few times and just amazed with all the different selections. Just waiting for my turn to do a meeting at the office and totally going to have them cater. Puts the local subway and some other national franchises to shame!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight for dinner after finding it on Yelp. They definitely deserve their 5 star rating. I had the Italian and he had the one of the ones with prime rib. Both were delicious! I will say I'm going to have a prime rib sandwich next time though. I took a bite of his and melted it was so good. They use all natural meats, no preservatives, etc., which is a huge bonus in my book. Also, they allow you to completely customize it to your liking. Best of all, the staff gave top-notch customer service, making sure we were completely satisfied with our meals. You could tell they took pride in what they were serving and it shows in the food."}
{"text":"Kind of between 3 and 4 stars. The Which was pretty good plenty of meat cheese etc service was slow, seems like they are missing that pop in the food and environment."}
{"text":"Sandwich Masterz offered an astounding range of menu items, and for me specifically, 20 different types of vegan sandwiches. It was almost too hard to choose until I found \"The Vegan Chimp\". It was a combo of every single vegan meat, vegan cheese and veggie offered. And boy was it delicious. It wasn't cheap, but neither were the ingredients in it. The bread was made fresh and all the veggies were nice and crisp. Sandwich Masterz uses Daiya cheese and Gardein meat products, so if you enjoy these you are in for a treat. I really liked talking to the owner's husband, Cas, he gave me lots of information on the business and it truly showed how much work he puts into this business. He said to be on the lookout for their new location opening in Tempe sometime around August. I'm going to have to agree with Arnold here and say \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"There are so many options and the ones I've been lucky enough to try have been amazing. The staff was unbelievably kind and attentive. It is not a typical sandwich shop at all; the staff comes from behind the counter and checks on you to make sure everything is going well. They seemed very knowledgeable about their product, offering information and discussing ingredients (natural and fresh!). The only negative thing about this place is that it's too far from my home."}
{"text":"Tried the Pastrami Pajamas lunch combo with cole slaw, loved it! They definitely don't skimp on the meat and they guys in there are always very friendly. I will drive out of my way to grab lunch here a few times a month. It's one of the best sandwich shops on this side of town, check it out if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"If you like flavor... and you like options... this is the place to go. It's probably the best thing to happen in Goodyear in a while when it comes to the food scene. It's affordable, healthy, huge portions and addicting... fact: I eat there at least twice a week for lunch. Fact: the pesto is ridiculously addicting. 

Okay, the interior is kind of awfully decorated but unless you are a gay bicoastal snob then it probably won't bother you. 

Fact: despite the decor I still go eat there constantly."}
{"text":"Pastrami Ruben was delicious. Perfect ratios of ingredients. Great quality meat and the sauerkraut was perfect and fresh. The side salads are not made on site. Typical deli salads."}
{"text":"This place has so many options! The food has all been yummy...every time we've eaten there. Also, the owner is in the restaurant, and he's super-nice and does everything to make his patrons happy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great meats and a perfect place if you love sandwiches. I recommend the perfect blend! It's legit!"}
{"text":"The food was great!! The sandwich was amazing. The atmosphere was clean and light music was playing. Such a relaxing vibe.   However the people working there was dirty looking,  their clothes was dirty as if they were homeless. Each person was unkept and one of the remake workers was sick or appeared to be because she kept coming out in the dining area to lay her head on table.  Thankfully gloves are worn to make food .  Again I like the sandwich but the staff should be cleaner. That was very disappointing,"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I'm not an actual vegan but I ordered a vegan turkey sandwich on wheat bread with vegan mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and onions. It was DELICIOUS. I am not one for \"fake\" meats (I like some veggie burgers though), but I honestly would not have been able to tell the difference between this vegan sandwich and a non vegan version. My mouth is watering just typing this lol

I also ordered a [non vegan] dark chocolate milkshake (although they do have a vegan version). I asked before hand and they told me that ice cream sweetens it so it ends up tasting like regular chocolate. Boy, were they right and I'm glad I listened! If the straws weren't so skinny I would have inhaled that shake. 

I don't recall what my mom ordered but she enjoyed her sandwich and the milkshake as well. We both agreed it was a great place to eat and that we will go back.

The staff were also very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, patient and caring. We had arrive just after a lunch rush they said, but the place was still clean from what I could tell, even the restrooms. I hope this place gets lots of business and sticks around because I love it. Easily one of my favorite places to eat and they have A LOT of variety.

I will upload pictures of the menu I ordered from. 10/10 recommend!Sign"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when I'm in the mood for sandwiches. I have been several times and have enjoyed each time. As a vegetarian my options tend to be limited when I go out for sandwiches, normally all I can get is a bun with vegetables on it (the usual lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions). However, Sandwich Masterz carries a wide variety of meat-free options such as veggie chicken, beef, and turkey. They can make most of their sandwiches on menu as a vegetarian option, and they have a long list of options available. On occasion the wait can be a little long, especially if they're really busy, but the sandwiches make up for it."}
{"text":"Such a great sandwich shop! We came in 15 min til closing and the owner to the employees were all super friendly. The owner took his time to get us familiar with the shop's all natural, no cold cuts concept. I got a twist on a prime rib dip and my husband got an Italian sandwich. Both were equally delicious as they were hefty in weight...totally worth it."}
{"text":"High quality customer service as well as countless sandwich options. Have gotten it delivered for myself and my coworkers and I on multiple occasions. For the quality of the food they serve, the price points are considerably honest although it may seem expensive at a glance. You may have to wait a while for your food but it is well worth it. They also offer a loyalty program. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and the options are endless. Just a little under 100 different sandwich combos."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Owners husband took the time to ask how the food was. Explained they are lightening up on the buffalo sauce due to yelp reviews...but offered me some on the side.  Thought it was great that they are listening to their customer feedback.   I had the buffalo chicken wrap and I replaced the pepper jack with provolone. At first did not know if there was any buffalo sauce because I couldn't taste it but that is when he came around and asked.  Once I added more, it brought the wrap to life.  Very good...will definitely be coming back and have already recommended to a few of my friends.  Friendly staff, good food, and listens to their customers....oh and super reasonably priced.... what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and not only is the food delicious but the service is spectacular as well. I love that they have over 146 different variety  of sandwiches and over 20 of them are vegetarian/vegan friendly. If you have gluten allergies, they can definitely accommodate by making it a wrap or salad instead. 

When I  come inside, I have been greeted warmly and the staff was friendly and efficient. I am so happy to have finally found a delicious sandwich spot close to work. I can't wait to try the variety of different sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Hands down the *** Sanwich ~ Masterz ~ 


My wife is a vegetarian and this was by far the only sandwich place she has more then 40 options to chose from

We are driving back from LA TO AZ and stoped at this place and take my words this was the best meal in my whole trip 


Great place"}
{"text":"My son went to the sandwich shop this afternoon and he had to come back   night. This was the best sandwich I've ever had. It is better than any sandwich chain on the market.  They were so friendly and the food is all fresh no preservatives or And a large vegan menu. You have to try this place it is awesome."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Service was fast. The sandwich was excellent with fresh bread, condiments, and ingredients. The service was quick and friendly. Was pleased to find out that the majority of the menu had no preservatives or additives, and is not Deli meat. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great quality, great taste 

my hubby loves their bruski sandwich it's literally the only sandwich he will get since trying it and for me every sandwich I've tried so far from them tasted really good :)"}
{"text":"Omg! I love this place I haven't eaten there I get take away. They have a massive selection of sandwiches! Vegan as well! Every time I go I try a new sandwich off the menu. One thing is for SURE don't forget to add the master sauce! Yummy.. yummy... I have the starving Marvin, United Kingdom, American pig, the perfect blend, the bruski, and The Godfather. All great sandwiches. Super loaded with meat and the bread is awesome!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an all natural sandwich shop, look no further!! The owner, Chaz is committed to making 'real food' never processed meats. Their Masterz sauce is a lite creamy pesto that is wonderful on their veggie sandwiches. My husband had a turkey, roast beef and pastrami. All 3 meats were very tender and moist. If you are looking for a healthier sandwich, that tastes great and served by a great guy, you must go to Sandwich Masterz."}
{"text":"I've ordered sandwiches from here multiple times with uber eats and these are the best and the biggest sandwiches around. Love the lunch combos that come with a side and a drink I get nothing but the best here"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They are always extremely nice and they go out of their way to make sure you come back. The garden vegi sandwich is the best sandwich I have ever had. I am a vegetarian and they have dozens of sandwiches to chose from. My husband has had a few of the meat varieties and has loved all of them. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little find on our way home from CA. Owner was extremely helpful and the sandwiches were delicious. I loved that it was real meat and not processed."}
{"text":"This was the best sandwich shop we've been to! The service was awesome and the food was AMAZING! Friendly atmosphere and enjoyed our visit. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best sandwich shop around.  The Italian is absolutely delicious.  The Masterz sauce is a must!  My husband always gets the Reuben and swears it's the best he's ever had.  The service is always top notch, fast, friendly, and always asking for feedback before we leave.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review
We order sandwich masterz from GrubHub all the time. We have never been in the restaurant but the sandwiches are fantastic! I swap out all of my sandwiches with gluten-free bread. The bread is delicious! I have ordered just about every meat on menu as well as the potato salad, coleslaw and milkshakes. Every Sandwich I have ordered as well as every side and drink has tested negative on the nima and more importantly I've never been sick. I simply state that I'm a Celiac on the notes in GrubHub and every single item I have received has been perfect to eat the first time. I am thrilled that we have a sandwich place that takes gluten free seriously and is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and get a sandwich with so many to choose from. The menu is  crazy huge. From vegetarian to mega meat. I could give this a 4 or 5 star review but I would have to come back. I would come back because my sandwich was good. There were a few things that I am not digging. I order a prime rib sandwich and I ask for lettuce and tomato but I did not get it. I didn't cry about it when I was there. But I am one that likes to get what I pay for. Now if my sandwich didn't taste good then I would have. It seems that pictures that are posted show these sandwiches have more meat in them. Mine seemed to be lacking that. It was weird because I didn't see much just more bread than anything   This place has really good bread. I ordered the sour dough. Very good. If i got what I asked for along with a little  bit more of that tasty good meat now that would get a 5 star. The girl at the counter was great she had all the qualities of what customer service is. So that is a plus and that's another reason I would come back. I look forward to trying again. Oh did forgot to mention they do have nice clean dining area."}
{"text":"The bread was amazing and the sandwich was even better! I had \"the big dipper\" sandwich with Au Jus. It's going to be hard to try another sandwich one that one was so good!"}
{"text":"Overall this place gets a 2 because the sandwich was decent but not great. The restaurant screams quiznos with the previous paint still in place, everything seemed dingy and very dirty from the restrooms to the floors, windows and sneeze guard glass. The guy at the counter was friendly but creepy at the same time. All the employees had a sad look or frown upon their faces. The sandwich was overpriced a buck or two and just OK. The menu has so many items its as if they take on sandwich and call it one thing then throw another item or two on it and call it another. How can you call an italian sandwhich a big italian for adding pineapple to it? Is there even pineapple in italian cooking?"}
{"text":"Hands down this is our favorite place if you want a delicious, fresh, killer sandwich.  They have something for everyone.  Meat lovers and Vegans alike.  Such a great menu to choose from. 
The customer service here is awesome.  We are always greeted with a warm hello, how's your day?  
We usually have our meal here because we love the music and the vibe here.  Everyone is always friendly.  

I can't say what my favorite sandwich is because they are all so good.  It would be hard to choose.  My husband loves the Beverly Hills.  

Check them out and tell them Robert & Ray sent you."}
{"text":"I accidently found this place on YELP and was impressed by the great reviews. So, I tried it today. I ordered a large Pastrami and Swiss on marble rye. I had lunch today and saved the other half for lunch tomorrow. Huge sandwich. Very tasty. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is nothing fancy, but has fresh amazing ingredients which means they have the best sandwiches around! I asked about their bread because it's so delicious and very fresh. Just like everything else on their menu (besides the meatballs), the ingredients are all natural and it is brought in from a local bakery every morning. I have had 4 different sandwiches from here and they have ALL been delicious. They have about 87 million sandwich options, a few choices for sides, an RC cola machine and there is truly something for everyone. Even my 5 year old begs to come here! It hurts my soul that we are *just* out of delivery range... but that's probably much better for my wallet and waistline."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting. The food was amazing. The crew was super friendly and helpful and they do not skimp on the meat! I had the green pig. The best BLT sandwich"}
{"text":"Fresh made bread, prime rib & roast beef made daily!! HUGE Vegan & Vegetarian menu, and the lettuce is cut fresh daily and not stinking from a package. Not SUPER fast but that's because it's all fresh made. Large amounts of meat not like subway or jimmy John's. This place is KILLING IT and thanks for being here, the West Side needs more FRESH food options."}
{"text":"Got the Big Dipper and it was REALLY good. My kids got The One with just the meat and cheese and even with that you could taste how great the sandwiches are. My husband tried the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was probably my favorite of the three. 
The staff is super helpful and friendly. One of them saved the day by giving my crazy kids a cookie so I could decide what to eat. (Thanks man!) Will definitely be back to try some others on the menu. 
Oh! And they have a large menu for vegetarian and vegan friends. Now I know where to bring that brother of mine. :]"}
{"text":"This is a owner run shop who are super friendly. Overall the concept is great. They have a huge selection of sandwiches and chose organic options for meats and cheese. However the bread is pretty thick and might defeat the purpose of an overall
Healthy meal. My only suggestion would be to offer Ali ed bread option as opposed to just rolls."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!

Best sandwiches in West Phoenix.  Not an easy accomplishment. 

They make sandwiches fresh and in a hearty portion.  They actually focus on quality over quantity, not just the latter.  

They also use real ingredients.  (unlike subway with its yoga mat bread)

The only complaint I have about this place, is the lack of beverages options, also their ice tea is always terrible.

But the sandwiches and chips are the best in the area.  You can't go wrong here, everything taste sooooooo good."}
{"text":"Great quality product. I'm just not a huge fan of the bread options they have. I believe some better breads would take it over the top."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters! The menu is through the roof.
I had the Italian on sourdough with the works and potato salad. Next time I will try different bread.

Very friendly staff and great music playing."}
{"text":"Best French Dip EVER!!!! All the ingredients are fresh as can be and put that on bread they make fresh everyday makes a sandwich that much better. I have yet to have a sandwich here that is not Amazing. Well worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!! Very friendly staff. Can't wait to come back. They have a HUGE selection of sandwiches. HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this sandwich shop!! The quality of these sandwiches is as good as it gets with fresh ingredients and a list of options a mile long!  We tried a few different ones and have never been disappointed.  The owner is friendly and considerate.  At times the line might be long but they are definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness an AMAZING Sandwich shop has finally made it to the Westside!!! I called in our order for four people after we found this new awesome establishment on Yelp. We pulled up their menu on their website....holy crap! I think we all wanted try everything of the 149 sandwiches offered, lol. Every menu item sounded so amazing we had to spend a little time with the menu. I absolutely love how any of their sandwiches can be made into a wrap or a salad (score for me because I was wanting a salad). 

We actually ended up ordering for delivery and the gentleman on the other end of the line was not only extremely nice and informative but completely honest. We ordered 2 Rubens then was informed they are way better to eat in the store since Rubens tend to be best eaten right off the grill....we still got one, also got 2 French Dips that we upgraded to prime rib...amazing!! and I opted for most likely to several, if not all people other than me sounded weird but it was awesome!! I opted for a salad substitute. I ordered #15, It came with excellent quality ham, pineapple, provolone and marinara sauce....I loved it. The lettuce was fresh and super good since it wasn't your typical lame iceberg lettuce. It was so good!

The French dips were phenomenal! The bread held up to the excellent flavorful au jus but the bread was still fresh and tender great bread. The quality of the prime rib was insanely good according to the parents that both got one :)

Boyfriend ordered the Ruben despite the heads up about it being best piping hot. This thing was huge!!! and much to what was said, when you've been delivered a quality sandwich with quality ingredients, I could have ate this sucker off a flip flop after being 2 days old and it still would have rocked my mouth and taste buds. (by the way, it came piping hot :)

We will be definitely back or order to-go since delivery in this area is sparse and was currently only pizza. 

Super quality, super customer service, fast delivery and amazing food can only amount to one thing.....PURE EXCELLENCE!!!

P.S.....next time we will ask for as side of their green masterz sauce :)"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best sandwich shop I have ever been to! 

I came here for lunch 11 days in a row while I was in town working. I would visit randomly between 11am-2pm. The place was never overly busy and hardly ever a 
wait (weekdays or weekends)! 

I tried a new sand which everyday (11 total!) they have probably at least 100 or more types of sandwiches on the menu. It was a little overwhelming at first, but the staff is more than willing to help you out. 

My favorite sandwiches were the Garlic PrimeRib Cheesesteak and The Big Italian. My favorite part is any sandwich can be a choice or multiple breads, 3 different styles of wraps or a salad. My favorites being the spinach and tomato wraps. 

You also have the ability to add several extra veggies and condiments to your sandwich at no extra charge (even jalapeños and mushrooms). 

They also have the $1 make it a combo deal. Which includes a medium drink, and your choice of coleslaw, macaroni salad, potato salad or chips! 

I can't wait till I come back into town again. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So good!!!! Ask for recommendations and you can't go wrong! We got our food Togo and they nearly packed it and it was amazing!! They recommended eating the Reuben first before it cools down and they are right! Amazing sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Not only is it a great sandwich sub shop, it's a great vegan one also! The Vegan cheese steak is my go to sandwich. Aside from the attention to detail, it's the attention to customer service and passion for great food that's all natural, non gmo and good for you. I found my new spot! Oh and you gotta try the Vegan shakes!"}
{"text":"Ventured to Goodyear for Dutch bros fundraiser and made a day of it. Yelp'd for a place to eat and voila! This place was great! All natural and so fresh! Veggie and vegan options. I had the salad and it was too die for. The turkey was warm, the bacon was phenomenal. Honestly all of it was good. Definitely not like those other sub shops. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Passing through on our way across Arizona and I'm so glad we stopped here! Delicious food and the people working here are really nice. My husband has a cheesesteak which was good and I had a salad with avocado, bacon, and chicken with their amazing Masterz sauce as dressing (YUMMMM)! The manager even came out to give our dog some salami :-) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great for vegans!! They have a whole vegan sandwich menu and vegan milkshakes!! Very friendly and attentive service. The owner/manager was checking on every customer, clean and the sandwich was soooo gooodd. Soft and fluffy bread and packed with tons of flavor. I got the \"vegan treat\", has meatless chicken and turkey, vegan mozzarella cheese, vegan mayo, lettuce, tomato and i added franks red hot, onions, and banana peppers. Ate the whole thing. Will come back to try the rest of the options!! Very happy, satisfied, and fulll."}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time. If you like fresh high quality food you have to try this sandwich shop. Forget Subway and all the other factory sandwich stores! This is the real deal with an amazing choice of meats, cheeses and condiments- sandwich menu is crazy good! GO.."}
{"text":"I didn't love it, but didn't hate it. The 3 star score means I'm still on the fence about the food.

The menu size is exhausting -- 149 sandwiches to be exact! In my opinion they are just a variation of one another, really. Maybe you get a simple turkey and it's called one thing. And if you add another ingredient, say avocado, it is called another name. The reality is that it is still going to be a simple turkey sandwich with add-ons. So, just have a few sandwiches, have a variety of veggies and sauces for customers to select and call yourselves Subway, Quinzos, or even Submarina. There really isn't anything that makes this sandwich place pop. Yeah some of their sandwiches have a ton of meats, but a great sandwich needs to have some balance, something that makes you want to come back. I'm not sure why so many deli places think a fist of meat in between bread automatically makes you an amazing food establishment?! 

I love a wonderful proportion of ingredients that blend well together and make the flavors shine. I got #78, the Prime Rib Stack per recommendation from the owner and the sandwich was okay. It was probably my fault because I had this whole idea of what it would taste like while I waited for it. And it just fell flat in flavor and seasoning, especially for the price.

I was also disappointed with the portion size of their sides.

Size sometimes matters and in the case of my friend's sandwich, she was disappointed. What should have been a six inch, ended up becoming a four inch sandwich because they cut off the ends of her bread. 

All in all, this place is okay, not great, nor mind blowing. I'm not entirely dismissing it, because I might find something I like out of the other 148 choices. I just won't be ordering their #78."}
{"text":"The best cheesesteak on the west side...OF THE COUNTRY not just in AZ. OMG this place is the Holy Grail of sandwiches. Excellent service, clean establishment and the sandwiches are deee-lish! I will definitely be back. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"What makes this location stand out is the service!  It is a quick-stop eating spot with fine dining service.  The owner is usually there taking the orders and he does a phenomenal job helping his customers make a selection.  Great food (both sandwiches and salads) great service....this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Real good sandwiches. I can't complain at all. The food is 100% real. They have never messed up my order or anything either. Friendly people with great sandwiches for a decent price."}
{"text":"This is an amazing sandwhich shop. Fresh and delicious. Never fails to deliver. Good to see that the meats don't contain preservatives. The sandwiches are pretty big, but well worth it. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. I come here a lot during my lunch break and even order for the shop I work at. They take care of every order fast and the sandwiches are even better. The prime dipper is my favorite and the au jus it comes with tops it off perfectly!"}
{"text":"Had the #94 Prime Dipped sandwich on sourdough and it  was good. My wife had the #74 Beverly Hills sandwich and she really loved it. They forgot the avocado and the owner personally brought it out for us and apologized. This is an Air Force veteran owned business, and they will always get our business."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. The custom sauces are delicious! I tried both the masters sauce and the garlic peppercorn mayo. Both were eatable without the sandwich. Then we have the actual sandwiches. They by far have the best selection of sandwich that I've seen anywhere. All sandwiches are hot. You have a choice of breads, and you can fully customize then. This is my new sandwich shop of choice. Try them out!"}
{"text":"This was a great sandwich spot. The gentleman at the register was super nice and explained to us how most of the menu is natural and not processed. They have a super large menu to include a large vegan menu. We are happy to have a nice sandwich shop in our area of town."}
{"text":"The best Reuben sandwich I have had in a long time if not ever. They cook the meat and slice it fresh to order. This was my first time here and they were helpful in coaching me how to order. The sandwich was huge. I will choose this place over any other sandwich or sub shop around from now on."}
{"text":"A location you would miss unless you knew how good the food was, then you would seek it out! Sandwich Masterz uses real food - not processed meats and cheeses. All natural makes a difference, and their House Pesto-base sauce (without any nuts) is delectable. A dollar or two more for a sandwich that you might get at a Slubways (misspelling intentional), but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! These guys are LEGIT! I had the \"No Rules\" and it was just amazing. Great flavor, just the right amount of sauce and meat, very friendly staff. We talked to Cas for a while and you could tell he was passionate about making killer sandwiches.
Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Killer all natural meats and breads. First visit and we really enjoyed our sandwiches. Staff was very informative and friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome guys ! & gals !! Yum - well this counts as a cheat day b/c I blew my entire week but love it Your sandwich place gets a \"Just Dam Good\"  Stamp of Approval- from the foodies in the Secreto clan !"}
{"text":"This is slowly becoming my favorite place to grab lunch. The vegetarian and vegan options are just way too good. Prices are fairly high, but is expected for a quality sandwich. 

**updated 5/9/17**

I was disappointed with this visit. I was curious about one of their vegetarian options and how they prepared it (the tuna). He said it was actually made with real fish and I quickly stopped because that does not align with my vegetarian diet. He continued to talk about this \"biblical vegetarianism,\" and how that trumps my eating habits because it is more than a couple hundred years older and that indeed eating fish is considered vegetarian (pescatarian, anyone). So, if you're a true vegetarian, make sure you ask before ordering because this was considered a \"vegetarian option.\" If I were to eat any meat or fish, I would get extremely sick as my body isn't used to eating those things anymore. Overall, it surprised me because the last time I visited, he was the same guy who repeatedly apologized to me about the extremely long wait because they are very serious about cross-contamination but had insisted about arguing with me about eating fish this time?

I digress, I ordered my usual April Showers sandwich, it was so sloppily put together, the honey mustard was mostly on the outside of the bun, making for a soggy sandwich that was hard to eat especially for the premium price of twelve dollars."}
{"text":"First time to visit...won't be the last!  Amazing variety of sandwiches on the menu. My wife had turkey with cranberry and cream cheese and it was very good. I had the Reuben. It was loaded up pretty good. Staff was very friendly and seemed quite interested in our satisfaction."}
{"text":"First time here today and it was fantastic! I got the mad boxer sandwich. The portions are great and filling! The staff was extremely helpful showing me all the options they have to offer. Even the manager checked on us to make sure everything was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best sandwich shop in town. Fresh meats, cheese, bread and ingredients. I typically always get the Big Italian. The sandwich is huge and fills me up. The menu is expansive and you could easily try a different sandwich every time you go and still be delighted. The owner has always been there when I'm dining in and makes sure that you are enjoying your meal. Support this local business, they are a great asset to Goodyear! Make sure to tell your friends about Sandwich Masterz, they will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place with the positive reviews and extensive sandwich menu. When we arrived, one of the workers greeted us and asked if we had been in before. We said no and she asked if we were meat eaters or veggie eaters and directed us to the appropriate menu. We sat down to look over the choices. With 150 sandwiches (and some very odd combinations) I was really surprised that there wasn't a sandwich with turkey, ham, and bacon. That's a common club that even Subway has. I decided to go with the Good Intentions which has ham, turkey, and American cheese. When the guy at the register rattled off the different bread options, I didn't understand him and asked him to repeat it. He did not say it any slower or clearer the second time. I thought I heard \"soft french\" bread so I went with that in the lunch size, mustard & pickles, chips, and a drink. They actually have Cherry RC Cola! I don't think I've ever seen that before. The music playing is what I would describe as \"angry\" (death metal?) and was not conducive to a pleasant atmosphere. I actually heard the \"F\" word a couple of times before the song was changed. The sandwich was fine and reminded me of Potbelly or Which Wich. During our meal, two of the workers asked how everything was. Another time, the guy walked over, stood right by our table and just watched us for a few seconds... didn't say anything. It was awkward and made me really uncomfortable. I decided it was time to go and quickly finished my sandwich, grabbed my chips and a refill, and we left. If I ever return to Sandwich Masterz, it'll be for takeout because the atmosphere was just terrible."}
{"text":"After being told about this place by a friend, I thought I'd give it a try.
Lots of available parking.  Staff were great and welcomed folks in particularly newcomers to the restaurant. 
Great business model of offering a huge variety of sandwiches, however a weakness in my opinion, is the large menu.  I counted 149 different varieties of sandwiches - too many to choose from or even too long to read from. 
Another weakness is the place is too small in terms of size and place to eat (-1).  There weren't enough tables (inside) to eat and, sadly, there weren't any seating available outside.  As mentioned, the business was small inside. I noted that folks would enter, and being new, would congregate around the entryway reading the exhaustively long menu.  This made it difficult to either exit the restaurant or return to your table (if you can snag one). 
Another drawback is that they were extremely slow in taking orders and being able to pay.  The line was snaking all the way to the door, where as I mentioned, there were folks already trying to familiarize themselves with the menu.  Whilst eating, I even saw a couple of potential customers come in and leave because of the long line and slow service. 
The sandwiches themselves were good, very tasty, and filling though the order was messed up -- ordered our sandwiches on wheat and it came on white, cups weren't given for our combo meals, and a side dish was also forgotten on one of the meals (-1). Of course, the cup and potato salad issues were rectified, but we didn't bother trying to rectify the bread issue because we didn't want to wait additional time again to have it fixed.  Side order was small. 
 I would definitely like to return to try some of the other 148 sandwiches I saw on the menu as it looks like a new business and I Patrick's liked their business model."}
{"text":"I've been to Sandwich Masterz a handful of times and the sandwiches are always delicious. The tall gentleman with glasses is always on point with customer service and he genuinely seems to care about the business and customers. That being said, my most recent visit left me disappointed. The music was too loud so I opted to take my sandwich to go (try to find any place that doesn't play their music too loud now a days). While waiting for my sandwich I watched the staff working behind the counter. I was shocked when I saw an employee wipe down the cutting board and bread knife with the same cloth that they had just used to wipe down the customer tables. I was in disbelief, and disgusted. They handed me my sandwich and I left. I wanted to talk to the tall guy with glasses about it (he seems like the one in charge) so he could talk to his staff, but I'm bad with confrontation."}
{"text":"Our first time and was a great experience. We ordered The Italian. Everything about it was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the the prime dip sandwich, soooo good and the guy who took our order was very knowledgeable. He let us know their meat is 100% all natural absolutely nothing in the meat. Everything was clean and the staff was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This is kind of a catch 22 at this location in Goodyear. The sandwiches are delicious and many varieties to choose from. But unless the issue I have has been resolved, there has been a smell from that building, even before it was sandwich masters and it was a Quiznos. I do recommend the food but take out or delivery from GrubHub is my suggestion."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice staff, and TONS of selections! You will be happy you tried them."}
{"text":"What a great sandwich salad joint. Vegan and vegetarian and of course meat lovers will have a party choosing from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"So I just recently moved out here from Dallas and one of the things on my list was to find a great sandwich/sub place. Sandwich Masterz was one of the few places that pop up on google. The first time I order something (which was a Sweet Chicken sub) from there the customer service was amazing and sub was on point. The employee was super friendly and helpful. The sweet chicken sub was so good that I order another one to go. 

Fast forward today, 6/19/2017. I decided to pick up a Sweet Chicken sub to go today. I ordered just the sandwich this time. I was talking to a gentleman at the register (tall guy with glasses), I told him that I was a big fan of the sweet chicken sub. Thanked him and went home after. Made it home and turned on the tv to watch Friends. As I savagely eat one half of the sub, I was about to demolish the other half when I realized that there was a strained of hair in my sub. I completely lost my appetite and immediately throw the sandwich away. I called the store to explain what I found in my sandwich and the woman who picked up responded with a lack of concern and only asked for my name...hoping for a more responsive interaction I messaged the store via Facebook.

********************UPDATE******************

Sandwich Masterz owner Cas contacted me this afternoon and apologized for the issue and will make another sandwich for me at no cost.

******************UPDATE 2 ******************

After work, I went to Sandwich Masterz and owner Cas again apologized for this issue and made another sandwich for me on the house and gave me a gift card for another sandwich meal combo."}
{"text":"The customer service was good. I hope the place makes it the Westside needs places like this. I was impressed by the sandwich selections there's so many. Looking forward for my next visit"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place we've found since moving to Goodyear. The menu is huge but don't let it overwhelm you as all the sandwiches are great. Potatoes salad is really good as well. We hit this place up at least once a week."}
{"text":"Love this place!:) although service is super slow, they at times seem very stressed, and could maybe smile to lift the mood of such a awesome sand which shop!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches have never been a great deal to me but they've answered my hunger, but this place changes that! Came here around 5pm on a Friday and ordered the Perfect Blend and Oreo shake. Oreo shake was alright, if you want a better shake I'd suggest walking a few feet over to Dream Swirls. 
The perfect blend sandwich was delicious! It is loaded with meat that is VERY tender. The vegetables were just the right amount that one item didn't over power the other. The lunch size sandwich was large enough to save the other half for lunch the next day, and it still tasted amazing after reheating in a toaster oven. Why have I been settling for Subway and grocery deli sandwiches all this time?!? Was their masterz sauce what made their sandwich delectable on top of tender meats? I must go back soon to try something else! I highly suggest Sandwich Masterz! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches... had a pastrami and it was delishhh.. friendly staff, clean and just good. Fresh"}
{"text":"My grandson ordered me a veggie sandwich thinking they would use all products without egg or dairy.  I am a VEGAN and they do have a special sauce without mayo, but he did not know and I received a mayo, lettuce, tomato and dill pickle sandwich. 
  
I called Jeff, the manager and he assured me they make things right.  He said they would re-make or he could get another sandwich at anytime.  Very good that they stand behind their product.  

Just my opinion....be very clear as to what you want so you get that product.  They are very large and would be three meals for me....too bad I could not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Another road trip and another fantastic sandwich. Thanks for the great lunch Sandwich  Masterz."}
{"text":"51 reviews with 5 stars for a sandwich shop... a sandwich shop with some pretty pricey sandwiches?  Could this place truly be worthy of those 5 star reviews?

Well, if I am the one answering that question, then I have to agree with the other 51 reviewers before me... it is DEFINITELY a 5 star sandwich shop!

I ordered The Perfect Blend.  It comes with Turkey, Bacon, Pastrami, Roast Beef, Cheddar, and any of the toppings/accompaniments of your choice.  So good!

My momma ordered the Turkey, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Avocado, Cucumbers, Masterz Sauce, Cream Cheese, and, again, the toppings of your choice.  Again, very good!

Both were served warm with crispy bread.  And the meats are not typical deli meat slices, they are real meats sliced, shredded, pulled, etc. and piled high on these sandwiches!

*****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"The owners net us at the door and introduced the menu and foods. Non-processed meats, GMO, no-fillers & vegan. I got over whai I paid for and fimally found an honest food at great price. Over 100 different different sandwiches to choose from at no extra cost."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the whole valley! Great fresh ingredients and meats! I will be going here every week. Finally a place I can call my official favorite. They just know how to do sandwiches the right way."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich shop. Not sure why everyone thinks it's that great. Bread was ok but a little too thick for my taste. Meat was quality but shave too thin and very dry. All in all decent but nothing that special. They do have a great selection of different sandwiches to choose from I will give them that.  Reasonably priced and good portion of food. Not sure if I would return."}
{"text":"Neat place.  Counter help very knowledgeable and made great suggestions.  The meats are shaved.  They are not processed.  I took 2 large sandwiches to go.  I would definitely go back.  HUGE...almost overwhelming variety."}
{"text":"This a top of the line wholesome, clean, and heathy establishment. Attention to detail is clear and shown in their delicious food. Service is great, you will get what you ask for and beyond. Overall they have a wide selection of choices and all seem to take on the same attentive care as the sub I had received. Great idea on a very healthy spot for the family would definitely recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"Holy Cow this place is amazing! If you are Celiac or just gluten free, you are in for a treat! The gf bread is delicious and soft and they well understand the need to wipe down everything to prevent cross-contamination..and did it cheerfully! You have a million options and can have whatever kind of sandwich you want..all made with fresh all natural meats and ingredients. I was blown away! The staff is super friendly and helpful, and my non gluten-free family loved their sandwiches as well. I highly recommend this place, I guarantee you'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll go with 3 stars for my first visit. I came here because of good reviews. My sandwich was average but maybe I need to try it again. The bread was a bit dry, the prime rib melt was a little dry. I would recommend they add au jus. Maybe keep a pot of sauteed mushrooms and onions around. My onions were not cooked and were barely warm. I will try it again to see if I just got there on an off day. The thing I really didn't like is the sandwich size. When we got home both my wife and I were shocked at just how small the sandwiches were. They need to compare their large to their competitors like Jer$$! Mike, or Fir@house. There's room for improvement so I hope they are listening."}
{"text":"Great place. We came because they offered gluten free sandwiches. Service was top notch. Food was fresh. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and had a different sandwich each time. This place is legit. And Veteran owned!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. The owner greets you when you walk in and wants you to enjoy your sandwich and experience more than anything. The menu usually has 100 sandwiches and he will help you select the right one. If you don't \"love\" the first bite, tell him, and he'll try again with something else. Absolutely perfect ingredients result in the perfect sandwich. You can't go wrong here. It's honestly equal to the best sandwich shop you'll ever visit. Plus, free delicious cookies for the kids as an added bonus."}
{"text":"Bread was good sauce was great ordered a chicken avocado tomato sandwich called razzle dazzle with extra veggies the two things I need on a sandwich tomatoes and avocado were missing. So disappointed!!"}
