{"text":"Attended the soft opening of The Waffle Bar tonight. The grand opening is July 15th. This was originally a prep kitchen for the Liège-style Belgian waffles that Jan, Valerie and their partners prepare for hotels and restaurants around Toronto, but they decided to open it up to the public after much lobbying from the neighbourhood. People were tired of breathing the sweet aroma of waffles that they could not buy!  They carry Greg's Ice-cream like burnt marshmallow and coffee toffee, but so far only dairy-based ones(come on dairy-free chocolate!) and they make their own waffles cones in house, of course. You can also order waffle sliders with various toppings that come in cool compostable banana bowls and sugar-covered beignets. Waffles are also available in to-go packages along with a bottle of rosemary and salt infused caramel sauce.   If you can't make it to the east end, you can find them making fresh beignets and waffles at the Brick Works Farmers' Market on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dessert Specialty: Waffles Menu items: Berry Medley with whipped cream, Belgian style Beignets & Waffle ice-cream Sliders  The new gem in town, The Waffle Bar, is opening its doors to the public at exactly noon time tomorrow July 15, 2012. For the first time in Toronto, an authentic Belgian style waffle shop has hit the streets of our beloved city with the promise of offering some of the best delicacies from the old country.  Just dough it! I believe should be one of The Waffle Bar's taglines. The uniqueness of their waffles is what makes this little spot hidden in the far east of The Beaches worth a trip. I was privileged to attend the store's pre-opening event and speak to one of the partners about what makes this place unique. In a nutshell their flavour and hopefully soon to be success is based on three key ingredients - the waffles are made with dough, not batter; they use pearl sugar imported straight from Belgium and all doughy delicacies are made with butter, never margarine or oil. Very tasty, very unique.  Now, let's talk about this pearl sugar the owner's speak of, which in my mind is la pièce de resistance. Pearl sugar is often used in Belgian waffles from the region of Liège. It's a product of refined white sugar. The sugar is very coarse, hard, opaque white, and does not melt at temperatures typically used for baking. In artisan gourmet waffles like the ones from The Waffle Bar, the sugar is so present in the consistency and texture of the waffle that one can feel, on rare occasions, as you chew the waffle, a bit of the crunchiness that still resides from the pearl sugar. One lucky bite like that will have you craving for them for weeks to come!  When I visited the store, the owners treated us to one of their big menu items, the Berry Medley with whipped cream. This was a simple mini-waffle covered in a what seemed like a blackberry/raspberry sauce and then topped with whipped cream and dusting sugar. Accompanying this, was another waffle covered in salted caramel and milk chocolate. Both were tasty, melt in your mouth goodness.  To also showcase some of the varieties of their waffle dough, we were treated to a delicious Belgian Style Beignet. This by far, was my favourite indulgence. Decandence is the word I would use to describe this beautiful ball of ooey-gooey fried dough covered in sugar. I mean, what's not to like?  And if beignets were not enough, The Waffle Bar also offers ice-cream on waffle cones, known on the menu as Waffle ice-cream sliders. The cones were tasty and had the proper sugar content balance. The ice-cream though, stole the show. With options like Toasted Marshmallows and Lemon Meringue, the ice-cream at The Waffle Bar was nothing short of spectacular and delicious. From what I understood, the ice-cream actually comes from Greg's ice-cream. So even though it's not made on the premises, you are guaranteed an icy treat that would taste as awesome as the waffles do.  Buen Provecho, Viviana,"}
{"text":"This review is not for their food product but rather for their way of doing business.  Hubby and I went to check this place out about a month ago after reading rave reviews on Yelp.  I was very excited since it is pretty difficult to find authentic Belgian waffles in Scarberia.    When we got there, the store was obvious closed for business and since there were no business hours or signs posted, we just figured they don't open on Mondays like many other bakeries.    We returned yesterday (2 weeks later on a Saturday afternoon) and the same thing.  No signs, no hours of operation...store was still closed.  Dismayed, we walked into the neighboring Threads (?) bakery where a very nice shop owner told us that the Waffle Bar will not be open again until some time in the Spring.   Apparently, they closed shop late in December, 2012 (before Xmas holidays) and the shop owners are not re-opening until spring of 2013.  It's pretty amazing that people do business this way and expect their customers to be loyal.  They should at least post a sign indicating their decision not to open until Spring so people like us don't keep returning in hopes of catching them on a day they may be open.    Very discourteous indeed."}
{"text":"Wafflebar is a vendor at the Brick Works Farmers Market on Saturday morning. It is the best waffle I have ever eaten, they use seasonal local fruit as a topping option, as well as chantilly cream or just plain icing sugar. The service is friendly and warm, and the waffles are a great accompaniment to the market coffee. I wholeheartedly recommend this vendor!"}
{"text":"The smell of waffle in the air!  WaffleBar does brings back memory of my trip to Brussels, where I ate  a Liege-style, not a Brussel-Style waffle on the street! That's what WaffleBar made freshly for me when order!  Naked Waffles ($3.50) is hot to touch sprinkled with just the right amount of powder sugar. Doughy and heavy in a good way. There is a choice of topping up with whipped cream, berries and ice cream..but for me I always like mine plain! Just like the real experience, I ate my waffle using my hand and enjoyed every bite of it!  The owners here are really friendly and nice. There is also a small table inside the store if you want to enjoy your treat with a cup of coffee here.  There are also some to go package..."}
