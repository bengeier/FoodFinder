{"text":"By far favourite pupusas in Toronto and awesome Orchata. Must go! And prices are decent"}
{"text":"Best pupuseria i have ever been to, the cooks are great and the food is ever better. This restaurant made me taste what real genuine pupusas taste like."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and had time to kill before a meeting g. We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We ordered 1 Papusa each and two entries...The Papusa was AMAZING!

The entries were enormously large and very delicious also! The gentlemen R next to us ordered shrimp soap that looked really good too!

Dress is casual; it has a cafeteria feel!"}
{"text":"The food here is really great.  I have to say it's one of the best restaurants in the area.  Portions are big and everything is very tasty.  The only issue is the service is so so.  It can take them quite a while to fill your order even when it's not that busy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price, staff could be friendlier but this is not rare with Latin restaurants so I don't expect much there but the service is quick and food good so I'll take that with a smile"}
{"text":"Je ne connais pas très bien le quartier lasalle mais en tout cas, j'y ai découvert un super resto qui offre de magnifique pupusas. C'est bon et c'est délicieux, au menu, j'ai sélectionné une pupusa au porc et haricot, le choux, et la sauce pimentée. Un délice pour les papilles! J'y retournerai n'importe quand."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love the Pupusa and Tacos!! The beef/steak Tacos are so juicy. We got the chicken n pork pupusas, the chicken was so cheesy!! The pork was so succulent!! They give you two types of hot sauces..Red is mild, Green is Hot!!! Homemade mom n pop shop!! Lots of locals come here! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Two of us went today Sunday around 6:30p to order some takeaway. 
They were bustling with customers and some waiting outside, so clearly they have a fan base. 

Our experience 
Price - are good for portions and types (shrimps+chicken +steaks) of food ordered. Paid $49.72 for our meals and extras. 

Ambiance - Jay's games playing, almost all customers seemed very happy and comfortable. It's not fancy, and not meant to be. So it gives you what you expect. 

Service: was OK. Again they were bustling busy, so I don't expect overly friendly service which is unnecessary and doesn't affect the most important part of a restaurant... The food

Food:
Portion are good. We ordered a varietal for sampling as this was our first time. 
Pupusas 
Empanadas Colombianas
Plato mixto - beef, chicken, mussels, shrimp, plantains, rice, tortillas and salad
Saltado de Carne -  beef, fries, rice, plantains, and salad

We didn't like the taste of the flour for the Pupusas, and it was it was weird to get the coleslaw and sauce in a baggie. Especially considering that I didn't know they were in a bag til we got home and could have easily been pierced and spilled. Other than that, the rest of the meal was good, plenty of leftovers. 

Will I return, probably. For some hot food, with actual seasoning and flavor in the area, this is a good option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place! Love their pupusa. 

Nice and quite place, although it can be quite cold inside. Great staff and great food. Not to mention my boyfriend is obsess with their horchata! 10$ for a pitcher. 
Would definitely recommend this place, if you want good and adorable Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"I've never been to El Salvador but it feels like I walked in. The menu is not in english but you can navigate through. Restaurant is packed, ample parking. The two of us ordered: 1x tamale, 1x pupusa, 1x empanada, and the mixed meat plate. We definitely had to pack food to go but we wanted to taste the menu. The pork and cheese pupusa was definitely the best of the appies. I could make due without the tamale. The empanada was good as well. The mixed meat plate was massive - very generous portion. You get chicken, beef, shrimp and mussels. The chicken and beef were kinda dry but the shrimp and mussels were really flavourful. Overall, def recommend and would come back and try other things on their menu such as the fish ceviche."}
{"text":"A wonderful little restaurant! Their menu is small but you'll be happy with the choices. I had the Pupusas with cheese, beans and pork. If you've never had food from Salvador, they are like pancakes that are filled with delicious ingredients!! It comes with a tomato sauce that you can pour on top if you like. Very fresh! Great choice if you are sensitive to gluten! The chef cooks from the heart and only uses fresh ingredients and you can tell in every bite! The staff is kind, knowledgeable and helpful!  The decor is rustic-modern and relaxed. I'll be going back soon! I'm already missing their food!"}
{"text":"Just on sheer value alone, 2 can eat until your jaws or bellies throw in the towel for ~$30. Pupusas are unique, chicharrones are delectable, Yuca tasty and service is super friendly. The decor is representative of the food-- simple and unassuming. No fancy hamfisted bullshit or scammy 'tapas'. You can tell this stuff doesn't get anymore authentic... it really is like walking into a small eatery in central America.

Unfortunately many hidden gem restaurants in LaSalle like La Guanaquita have short lifespans and don't even see their first birthdays. I just sincerely hope that won't be the case for the lowkey Salvadorian joint.

If you don't feel like cooking, or ordering the same old boring greasy nitrate-riddled pizza, do yourself a favor and stop by before it's gone."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that all these years have gone by and I have overlooked this marvelous place!  I went there with a colleague today - she is from Venezuela and loved the place (as did I).  This is solid, Salvadoran fare, beautifully and VERY GENEROUSLY prepared.

The chicken soup was exquisite.  The papusas ... mmmmmmmmmmm.  HUGE.  Tasty.  Also had the tamarind(o) drink.  Go to this place!  You will not regret it!  Nice atmosphere - everyone is there for some home cooking!!"}
