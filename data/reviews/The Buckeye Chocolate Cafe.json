{"text":"One of my favorite places. Really nice atmosphere, staff is always super friendly.  
Great coffee."}
{"text":"A great addition to Chardon! This place has a cozy/cool vibe and the coffee is excellent. You can expect to find a diverse menu, tasty baked goods, delicious chocolates, and a staff that is very friendly and courteous. In front, there is a small patio area and also a drive through for those who are needing their caffeine fix on the go."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy and delicious chai lattes! Quiet vibe so nice place to relax. Will return!"}
{"text":"Buckeye offers the BEST Chocolate Mocha I've ever had!  Stop in and try it, you won't be disappointed.  Even had it made with Almond milk and it was wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"After getting back from a trip to Australia in June, and all the amazing coffee we had there, it is so good to finally find a place locally that has just as good coffee if not better! Love the lattes, love the latte art. Everyone is so friendly here. I have been twice now and can recommend the bagel, egg, cheese, and bacon sandwiches. They are huge and I took half home for lunch. I also love the vanilla lattes. The place is very cute and lots of seating. I also am a fan of the punch card for rewarding customers. Keep it up! Please come to Mentor!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a breakfast menu and an espresso bar, as well as lunch wraps and salads. This is in addition to the fine chocolates. I also saw a note about an evening open mic and a full bar with interesting cocktails. They have an outdoor patio in front with shaded tables, as well as lots of space to sit and work in the air-conditioned space inside--just ask for the wifi password!"}
{"text":"I've been here five times and just gotten a large \"flavor of the day\" coffee each time. They were all great.  Nice place to hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"Great spot when I'm back home in Ohio. Food is good, coffee drinks are pro and they have a quiet area and a more social area. At least it seems that way. Full bar and patio that I have yet to take advantage of. Great place to study, have a meeting or work. Love the staff too nice people!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop for the final day of our trip to Chardon. We didn't think ahead super well and didn't consider that many places were closed on Sundays, however Buckeye was highly recommended to us as a great place for breakfast and coffee!

My boyfriend & I got the avocado and harvest toasts. The bread was toasted, super grain-y, and delicious. Was a great platform for the tasty and fresh toppings. Avocado, bean sprouts, goat cheese, & roasted veggies! Both toasts were great and I'd 100% get them again the next time we visit Chardon. The coffee & cappuccino's were ordered were great as well. I only wish we'd seen their coffee cocktail list before ordering...the chai Russian looked amazing!

They have an assortment of pastries, chocolates, and treats for sale as well. Also some retail items like soaps and things that looked like great gifts."}
{"text":"Loved this chocolate shop/cafe! The style inside is rustic industrial with chocolates set up on display for purchase. Then there is a counter coffee shop and cafe with breakfast and lunch items. The beverage menu is very extensive with many interesting coffee items. Their web site states that there is open mic night on Friday evenings and live music on Saturday. There are wine, beer and specialty cocktails available. 

I ordered an iced chai latte with almond milk and my friend had a cafe latte. The latte was beautiful. The iced chai was good, but not spectacular. The tea seemed priced a bit high to me. There was a 50 cent up charge for the almond milk and I don't think there was more than a splash in it, so I don't understand the up charge at all. I appreciate their attention to quality natural ingredients. Upon leaving I ordered a turkey panini and a brownie to go for my family. I tried the panini and it was delicious! I heard the brownie was good also and it came with one of their buckeyes perched on top! These items were priced reasonably. 

The staff was helpful and friendly and brought your order to your table. The place was clean including the bathrooms. There was a patio out front for nicer weather, but it was directly on the busy road. 

I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.  The flavored coffee is also really delish, not that fake taste that so many flavored coffees have.  With good food and friendly accommodating staff, this coffee shop has a really great atmosphere including a nice patio area.  The chocolate is also delicious with many options for gift buying as well.  They also have an open mic night now for extra fun.  I enjoy stopping and having coffee and breakfast or lunch while reading or studying."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's a more modern coffee shop with a rustic feel and the only problem we have is that it's too far from our apartment! They have live music on many Saturdays, free flavored water, and fantastic truffles. We have eaten from their menu on three separate occasions and have never been disappointed. The menu changes, because they use seasonal ingredients, but it is always unique and has vegetarian-friendly options. Also, delicious drinks. 

P.s. We even had my mom's surprise 50th birthday party here!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops. We travel from Chagrin Falls to Chardon just to get a cup of their coffee/treats. They have a wonderful drive through but the inside is so cozy you almost have to go inside. They do all payments on an iPad so it is easy to use apple pay as well. They have a wonderful staff and exceptional products. Buckeye Cafe offers a variety of foods as well that are great for lunch and breakfast. They even offer a few gluten free options as well. I highly recommend Buckeye Cafe and we cannot wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem offers everything you need to be happy- chocolate, coffee, food, cocktails & beer, free infused water, a cozy work space, and free wifi. It's unassuming from the outside but inside is a warm haven of delights. I ate the brussel sprout salad, which was delicious- well worth the price. I also enjoyed the drink special, which was some type of Fourth of July summer cocktail- being that it's Christmas I was pleasantly surprised at the summer drink! It's hard to get summer flavors in the dead of winter. The staff was courteous and professional while still being low-key. I am very excited to go back and try a different craft cocktail. Also, I was there during the after school rush- it seems to be a meetup place for high school kids after school. They were never obnoxious and didn't stay long, so I didn't mind."}
{"text":"This was a cute restaurant with a very quaint vibe. The summer toast and the strawberry banana smoothie were both delicious and the chocolate truffles were excellent. Great spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time stopping at the The Buckeye Chocolate Cafe! I was pleasantly surprised! I had the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce. The chicken salad tasted and looked very fresh! The bed of lettuce was a high quality lettuce looked like some type of butterhead lettuce with a balsamic glazed drizzled over. 
My chai tea latte was very good and it was made with almond milk. The cashier told me it was a good quality chai mix when I asked her if it was filled with additives and crap! Haha she said it had no high fructose corn syrup and was free of other things! (Let's hope she is telling the truth) 
She was super friendly and answered all my questions with a smile. 
I used the drive thru window so I am not sure about the Decor and ambiance to the place. But I will say they were very speedy at the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here this morning for the first time. Loved it! Avocado toast with sprouts and a strawberry banana smoothie, and I didn't even need to get out of my car! Exactly what I needed this morning!

Just tried the Thai Peanut Salad for lunch today and it was awesome!

So excited! The Thai Peanut Salad is finally back! They've also patched the parking lot to cover the massive crater we used to have to drive around. My other suggestion is separate lines for vehicles placing and picking up orders. That way, those picking up don't need to wait so long. Love this place!"}
