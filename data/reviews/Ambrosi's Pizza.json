{"text":"First time ordering from here and it's amazing! Not greasy at all, the crust is to die for, the place inside is immaculate!!! We live across the street and will be regular customers :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone would rate this place anything but amazing! The pizza is great and the place is always clean! Owner are there always making sure everything is in tip top shape! A+++"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza! Deeeeeelicious. No complaints here. Kind of hidden in one of the many plazas along Mayfield. A find! Good service and prices, too."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre pizza. Crust reminded me of cardboard. Probably on par with hot and ready shops. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"yummmy!!!!!! this is our first time eating here, we heard about it through our co-workers, we bought the calzone and the greek salad, my friends says it is a solid 5/5, the place was clean, the people were awesome and the salad was fresh and plenty as well, we will be going back again.Thank you."}
{"text":"I suspect this pizza shop is CLOSED!! They were not open as of 6/10/17 when we arrived to place an order about 7 PM.  Phone rings and connects to an answering machine login. Hours have been removed from the door. Two weeks ago they had a note on the door indicating they were closed for the memorial day weekend and will reopen. Also their hours were bizarre. A pizza shop that closes at 10:00 PM on a Saturday?? Really?? Its too bad because we really liked the pizza!"}
