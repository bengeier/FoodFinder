{"text":"I love Brother's restaurant, it's a popular spot for my family on special events like birthdays and anniversaries. The food, simply put, is amazing. I've only ever had a few of their pastas but the pizza is the best in Whitby bar none. Staff is friendly and accommodating and the owner frequently makes his rounds throughout the restaurant and speaks with everyone. Don't let the scuzzy parking lot throw you off, this is an awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"We attended Brothers as a party of 6 for a small celebration. 

We made a reservation and our table was ready and waiting when we arrived. 

The corkage fee was quite reasonable, so we were happy about that, however the restaurant did not have a wine decanter. No big deal there, but a little odd. 

We ordered bruschetta and escargot for appetizers and both were very good. 

For the mains one person ordered pasta, 4 had steak and one the veal. 

The pasta was the most tasty dish out of the three (penne con pollo). Our own mistake for ordering steak at a pasta and pizza joint. One was severely undercooked. When we pointed it out to the server she transferred it to another plate and had it cooked some more. The steak also had a fair bit of grit to it. 

We poured our own wine and were not offered coffee or tea after our meal. 

Our server was friendly enough but we would likely not return."}
{"text":"The food was just ok the fettuccine had to much garlic, escargot was nice flavor but could off been warmer.  The French onion soup was also the same tasty but void of been warmer. The price is reasonable for the quality"}
{"text":"Take a break from the hum drum and/or get out of the hustle of life for an hour or so. Come in to Brothers and relax and dine on great food and enjoy awesome service, and I can't stress this enough: leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!
We used to order it a lot but started to get hooked on other menu items. Daily specials are always great.  In house baked bread is incredible! Quality of food and service overall is always superb. You only find that kind of thing in family owned places.
So last night we were in the mood for quality pizza but wanted to stay home and watch a movie. So we ordered ahead and picked up. One bite into it and I remembered why we use to have it as our pizza of choice! Quality of toppings, sauce and the dough.... Perfect!
Honestly had to be one of the best I've ever had in!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service in a quiet neighborhood. It looks unassuming, but don't let that put you off. Had a very enjoyable meal and experience."}
{"text":"It's not bad for your standard Italian fare. The food is decent, priced reasonably well, service is ok but don't expect too much.  It's an older restaurant in an old strip plaza.  The place needs a bit of a makeover and IMO, so does the menu.  But hey, chef Ramsay can't be at all places."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant!
I would also highly recommend making a reservation. We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 and the place was packed.
Great atmosphere, great service. I had 3 options I couldn't decide on for dinner - the waiter, Jarrett made his recommendation and I was not disappointed. The Chicken Marsala with Mushroom Risotto was incredible - I kept eating long after I was full. The portions are very generous.
My husband ordered the New York Striploin and was very happy with his choice!
We will definitely be back - I need to try the other two options on the menu that I couldn't decide on :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just average and not really an authentic Italian eatery. My colleague and I went there for dinner, and were disappointed based upon our experiences vs. what I saw on yelp. The appetizer Bruschetta was not made right as Italian style, and the entree Veal Parmesan tasted awful. Overall I'd not recommend this restaurant to someone who is looking to get some real Italian food."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant and effective service staff. Never feel rushed or ignored no matter how busy. I like their pizza and excellent lasagna. Once had their veal parmigiana and also very tasty. The owner is very hands on which can explain the quality of their kitchen and consistently good service."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices.
Kind of really don't agree with automatic tip of 3 people or more (I think that's the number) but I understand because waitresses work their 
a$%es off.
Great service"}
{"text":"I just took my parents to Brothers Restaurant for their birthday, and we had an excellent meal. The seafood pasta was incredible as always with shrimp, bay scallops and salmon. My wife had an amazing shrimp fetticine in a marinara sauce that was quite delicious. I had a New York steak that was cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

Our server was Alicia who was absolutely fantastic. She was extremely friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. She even noticed that it was a special occasion and asked if we would like her to take some pictures ... without even asking her! 

Brothers js a great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"THE best Italian restaurant in Durham Region. I know the website says Mediterranean, but it's all Italian to me. I've never had a bad meal and the service is pretty good. Ironically, the longest wait is getting your bill. Making reservations is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It's only open for dinner, so call ahead!  It's got a 'nice' restaurant feel, so I wouldn't wear track pants. Everyone else seems to be dressed up for an occasion of some sort in there every time I'm there!

Their website looks pretty new and there's not much on it. I assure you the menu is fantastic and it has to compete with the weekly specials. Not an easy choice: pasta, meat or pizza; you won't be disappointed. The d√©cor needs an update, but is well taken care of and comfortable. We're not here to talk about seats, are we? NO.  

My step-dad, the resident pizza connoisseur, has never ordered anything else there and he was not disappointeds I ordered Cheese Ravioli in a rose sauce. Mmmmmmm. The giant raviolis were full of goat cheese and there was more than enough sauce to coat each one. My mom went with the salmon special. The fish was flaky and flavourful. It was smothered in a cream sauce and served with seasonal veggies. 

The desserts are the same desserts you can get at most restaurants. They're not made in house. They're as good as you can get anywhere. Usually too full for dessert anyway! 

 This is our go-to for family events and special occasions. Everyone likes it, even the pickiest eaters! Brothers is a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Have visited Brother's Restaurant twice and will go back again.  The food has been top notch and the service impeccable.  

Special thanks to Liz and Angela for their personalized service and to the owner for stopping by to make sure we were enjoying our experience.

If in Whitby and looking for a place to try, check out Brother's Restaurant; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here again last night for dinner and the food and service were excellent.

True to my word, I ordering the Chicken Marsala once again, in fact, three of us at the table did. This time I selected the creamy risotto with sun dried tomato and artichoke.

Fantastic!

My husband ordered the 8oz Sirloin topped with a red wine peppercorn demi glaze, also accompanied by the risotto ($19.95). I have to say, this was one of the most flavourful steaks I've tried in a long time. It was cooked to perfection and the little piece he offered to share with me simply melted in my mouth.

Delicious!

As always, the wait staff are excellent here and believe me, they hustle! I honestly can't get over how busy this restaurant is (well, I can, considering how good the food it) but it's crazy!  Make sure you book reservations well enough in advance if you're planning on going.

Oh, and another thing I should mention which I didn't know before... you can order pizza for take-away. A little too far away from where I live to benefit me but for those in the area, I think this would be brilliant."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and tried this place out. It was so good that I came back two days later. I had a small Hot 'N' Spicy pizza and tried a few of the local micro brews. The pizza was cooked perfectly. The pizza crust was thin and crispy and there wasn't too much sauce. The yellow peppers definitely added some heat but it wasn't overpowering. For dessert I had one of the best pieces of carrot cake I have ever eaten and lucky for me it was the last piece so it was extra big.  The waitresses were very friendly and the service was fast. This place will definitely be one of my go to spots when I am in town for work."}
{"text":"Ended up stopping by Brothers with a friend this past weekend. Do yourself a solid favour and do make sure you make a reservation as the wait can be fairly long during their dinner hours. However, it should be mentioned that the service was really friendly and very accommodating. 

Brother's offers a really well rounded selection of pastas but their pizza is really out of this world. We ended up getting two side salads and thought we could split their \"House\" pizza. Yeah, we were wrong! The pizza was great and the toppings were plentiful. We both had leftovers for the next day. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sat at our table for two in the middle of the restaurant for close to 20 minutes after being seated by the owner Chris. Watched waitresses pass by our table numerous times looking at us with our menus closed ready to order. After watching people seated after us with bread on the table and glasses of water poured, it was very clear that we were not going to rate in their eyes. My wife and I were hungry and tired of being ignored so we got up and left. Chris clearly couldn't give a damn because he was too busy chatting up his regulars. Some of the waitresses were to busy chatting with the other diners. I have no idea if the food is any good. We never got a chance to try. If it's anything like the service tonight, it's worth going somewhere else. I prefer going to a restaurant that recognizes that service is an equally important part of the dining experience. Almost as important as taking the dinner order to get things started. We ended up going down the street to Hot Rocks. Just as busy but they managed to seat us have drinks on the table and dinner served in and us out the door in one hour."}
{"text":"Another exceptional meal at Brother's. We shared a beet salad, and really it was enough for a meal for two. Dressed perfectly, it included sweet, red onion, slices of orange, tomatoes and plenty of goat cheese. I also had the special which was chicken piccata - moist and fragrant with capers. The highlight for me? Addictive fettuccine Alfredo on the side - honestly, I had to push the plate away because I just couldn't stop eating it.
As others have suggested, reservations are strongly encouraged. So make them and get here! Date night, celebration, or just plain dinner - a very good choice when you're in Whitby."}
{"text":"I don't make it to the whitby area much but this is a must stop.  I had the penne con pollo this time and it was great.  The service is second to none and I highly recommend Brothers.  If it is more than one you will need a reservation. If it is just one they have always seated me even if there was a line.  This is the best Italian food around."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was pleasant and insightful. We had a table for 6 and we tried various apps and mains. Everyone got what they ordered even with a few minor variations, which were easily and correctly handled. I did notice the servers attention was sharp to detail, food was hot and served at the same time. All in all a fine dining experience well suited for families or couples alike."}
{"text":"Food isn't all that good. Way overpriced. Would not recommend.

Terrible for kids, or elderly people. Not good if you dislike fancy Italian food. If you want some more normal, casual food, you're right out of luck.

This would be a good place for a middle aged, decently wealthy (or at least not poor, if you're gonna waste your money somewhere, don't waste it here) couple going out for a fancy meal."}
{"text":"Brothers Restaurant is located in Whitby and can be difficult to find if you don't know its there. While my boyfriend has pointed it out numerous times, I probably would have gone right by the tiny plaza its housed in without a second thought. My boyfriend decided to take me out for dinner here on Valentines Day.

We had a reservation for 7:30 and I had no idea what to expect given that it was a holiday where people go out to eat all the time, meaning it would be VERY busy. We walked in and I was pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere. It's not a huge restaurant but its not crowded. The tables are far enough away from each other that you don't feel like you're sitting on top of someone and its got a very warm feeling to it. We arrived a bit early and had to wait for our table but were seated promptly at 7:30 as per our reservation.

I ended up starting with the Caprese salad and had Scaloppine Piccata Al Limone (veal with capers, lemon, butter and white wine) with pasta on the side as my main.

Our salads came out quickly and good lord... if you do anything when you come here, try the Caprese salad. Not only do I love caprese salad but I love GOOD caprese salad and this one was TO DIE FOR. I could have eaten three more and that would have been good for dinner! Wonderfully fresh bocconcini cheese with tomatoes and basil drizzled with balsamic and olive oil. The balsamic was incredible, probably some of the best I've ever had.

Our meal was out fairly quickly as well, even though the restaurant was full, the kitchen staff really know what they're doing here. Everything was well timed and at the appropriate temperature when it arrived (warm bread, hot food, etc). My dinner wasn't exactly what I was expecting (who knows what I was expecting... not even me...) but it was superb. The veal was tender and the sauce was super flavorful. One bite with the capers and I was in heaven. The pasta served underneath it had almost a rose sauce on it and was a nice addition to the meal. The fresh veggies were nicely done and still a tad crispy, which is perfect. Nice portion size, not too much but not too little.

Overall, everything was fantastic, couldn't ask for more for a special dinner out. Our server was excellent, stopping by just enough so that we felt taken care of but not so much that we felt smothered. I will absolutely come back to Brother's again in future and I look forward to trying something else of the menu!"}
{"text":"Good service! Pasta nothing special and chicken parm was a whole chicken breast instead of cutlets. Therefore taste was disappointing. Portion sizes are good."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! It is not a thin crust pizza but that's okay because their dough is made fresh in house and you want every last bite of it. Very cheesy and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"This a great little gem of a friendly neighbourhood restaurant. Great Italian food; for the most part I just have a salad and the hot and spicy pizza. The pizza is the best I've had in recent memory."}
