{"text":"Best Chinese food in Cleveland.   They are always professional and make great food.  Everything I've had from there has been wonderful.  Clean restaurant fresh food.   Best Chinese food in Cleveland as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"The one with the super nice and friendly staff. You get the sense that these folks are determined to be the best. Their food is so fresh, never greasy, and arranged with care. I actually exclaimed \"How pretty!\" when I opened my beef broccoli takeout, because everything looked so neat and tidy, with the greenest broccoli ever. And glory be, no sauces running over into the rice! 

The egg rolls are a bit too dry (better than too greasy!), but still very tasty, and jam-packed with crisp veggies. The egg drop soup is extremely thick and flavorful; a pint is more than enough for two people because a little goes a long way. My favorite thing by far however, is that the food is CONSISTENT. You're going to get the same high quality every time, which seems to be a rare thing to come by for Chinese food in on the West side (I'm looking at you, Dragon Towers!). New favorite restaurant. These guys have raised the bar."}
{"text":"Definitely a plus when Dragon Light is open on zombie jesus day. The lady who took my order couldn't have been any more nicer and on point with my order. I arrived early and again was pleasantly greeted. Dining room was cool, not sure why a booth had a bench facing the wall. Seems awkward, yet still amusing. 

Anyways, I should have checked my order which I usually do, but I felt confident it would all be there and correct. Indeed it was.

General Tso had a nice smoky flavor to it and was crispy and awesome. Chicken in the chicken broccoli combo was fresh and legit chicken. Fried rice cooked well, but I could always do without beansprouts. Egg rolls were awesome, as well as the wonton soup. Glad I gave Dragon Light a try and definitely will come more often."}
{"text":"I had high hope for this place because of the reviews but unfortunately the orange chicken was extremely burnt and inedible. The rest was pretty much standard takey outy. The lo mein was angel hair and bland, I prefer the big noodles. I never would have actually wrote a review if the chicken was not so overdone, I can not believe that the person making it or the person packing it up could not see how dried up and dark it was. If they don't care enough about the sate of their food I do not care enough to give it a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Chinese resturants. this place is the best tasting. the food taste so fresh.  Theybhave been in business for many years. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place, we were a little disappointed. The food was \"heavy\" and didn't have any subtleties to the flavors. The Orange chicken was dense and filling. Portion sizes were large, pretty presentation, and the crab Rangoon was ok."}
{"text":"The best pepper steak ever!! love how nice the lady is always so welcoming happy and just as sweet as can be main reason why I love going there!"}
{"text":"It's been a while so I'll throw an update on.  Nothing has changed with regard to the food...it's still the best Chinese on the West Side, no question.  But I will say that it's obvious the proprietors read their Yelps because the very next time we went there, our waitress bent over backwards to address every.single.one of the negative points I mentioned in my original review (well, except parking, but c'mon..)

Since then there's been a little backsliding, but I never have to wait for water anymore!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many great reviews. We just threw away $30 worth of food because it was all inedible. The crab Rangoon was processed crab and nothing else. No cream cheese. Nothing. Had no flavor. The dumplings had 0 flavor and the texture was off. I've never seen orange chicken prepared this way. It tasted like straight oranges, had double breaded chicken that was rock hard and soaked in oil and the sauce was black and super thin. And worst of all a big black ant crawled out of one of the boxes. I live in an apartment and in the 8 months I have lived here I have never seen an ant let alone a giant black one. I guess a positive was that they know how to make white rice? It's unfortunate because even though the ladies spoke barely any English they were extremely nice. I honestly don't know how anyone could call this place \"the best Chinese on the west side\". It is far from it."}
{"text":"Best American Chinese restaurant by far in Cleveland! When I moved here my boyfriend showed this little spot and I have been hooked ever since! The staff are so kind and they know our order every time we call! 2 orders of sesame chicken with lo mein and extra sesame seeds! Best sesame chicken anywhere- I dare you to find better! Thank you dragon light, so worth the drive and braving the neighborhood! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Amazing crab Rangoon!!! We both got shrimp dishes, everything was really good. We both ordered pork fried rice and it was very tasty! Egg rolls with hot mustard, yum! The mustard was amazing. We live in CA and were visiting family in Cleveland (funeral) but we will go back. Parking was okay/ we got lucky to find a spot out front, but neighborhood isn't upscale :-) Food was delicious and service was above average. I'm a happy camper and super full!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese place.  I have yet to try something I didn't like on their menu.  I recommend the Singapore Noodles, the black pepper chicken and the Mongolian chicken (by far my favorite).  I normally pick this up and bring it home, but I have eaten in as well.  Either option is great.  

Only note, they are Closed Mondays"}
{"text":"To start off...I don't think I've ever had chinese food that blew me away, and I've been to Hong Kong and Chinatown in San Francisco.  

In my Chinese food experience, it's either good or bad.  DRAGON LITE IS GOOD.  It's located by my office in Cleveland, so I've really only eaten lunch here. FOOD IS GOOD, PRICE IS GOOD, SO REVIEW IS GOOD.

Pictured is the Singapore Noodles  (yellow curry) with chicken, fried rice and egg roll.  Add a Pepsi and the total was $7.99 + tax and tip!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden Cleveland jem, folks.  Food is always fresh and delicious.  Service is always awesome.  We have a Chinese restaurant at the end of our street and several others that are closer to our house, but we go out of the way to order from Dragon Light.  It's that good.  The egg foo young is legendary, and the pho is fantastic.  Skip the fried food.  You won't regret ordering from Dragon Light!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems that you are always so lucky to find now and then.  The food and service are top worthy of the five stars in every way.  The sauces which are the key to different Chinese stir fry dishes are very authentic.  The hot and sour soup and the egg drop soup are some of the best I have ever had including Chicago Chinatown.  Portions are good sized and the tea is very good and not over steeped.  If you want excellent Chinese food and are in the area, it is worth the trip to get your eat in or carry out."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant 4 times now and all experiences have been wonderful. The restaurant has seating for dine in but a lot of customers seem to order take out. The owner is very nice and she has held the door for me on more than one occasion as I was leaving. I have had the triple delight which is shrimp, chicken and beef which is very good. I have had the vegetable egg foo young, hunan beef, shrimp fried rice and vegetable fried rice and everything has been excellent. It has taken a long time to find a place that makes good egg foo young. They also have a Thai menu to order from also. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Cantonese dishes."}
