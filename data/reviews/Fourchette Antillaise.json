{"text":"My favourite restaurant for Haitian/creole food in the area!! I have family that live in Montreal and this is our go-to restaurant for special occasions! We love it! And the kids love it too!   They relocated and their new restaurant is much bigger and more improved than the last. The food is always amazing! My family and I came for the lunch buffet on a weekend (we've never had their buffet before) and it was so worth it! They had a good variety of foods and still excellent quality! The restaurant was very clean and organized. One of my favourite dishes is their griot (fried pork) with rice and spicy pickly in the side....amazing! Our fave appetizer to get is the acras....it has a nice spicy kick, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! So good! Will always come to this restaurant for as long as they're around! And will continue to recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée un dimanche soir j'ai pris le poulet créole (poulet en sauce) c'était vraiment délicieux ! Tout était bon, le riz, la sauce, le poulet, les plantains (moi qui habituellement n'aime pas le plantain). Mon amie a pris le legume qui était tout aussi bon. Par contre pour le buffet il faut arriver dès l'ouverture (pensez à réserver) car à l'heure où nous sommes arrivés il était trop tard c'était terminé. Un des meilleurs restaurants haïtien à montréal."}
{"text":"Très belle place. Le griot est incroyable et le service était super.   Bonne place pour fêter un anniversaire."}
{"text":"While in Montréal last month, a friend recommended this place.  I wanted to get some good Haitian food before coming home. She mentioned that they have buffet style dining, and that food was really good.  When we first pull up to the shopping center where it's located, I wasn't impressed.  It's not in the best part of town, and parking was horrible.  It was impossible to find somewhere to park.  So, we got dropped off, while the driver/my cousin went looking for a parking spot. I was very surprised when I got inside the restaurant because it was so nice and modern.  It definitely doesn't belong in that shopping center.  The place is kind of tight, and just very open.  We had to wait for a table, but the lady was very pleasant and engaging by letting us know that they were working on our table.  The place was also packed.  I noticed multiple large parties.  It seemed like a popular Sunday and family spot.  I couldn't wait to start eating at that point.  There was a short line when I got up to go get food.  I was so disappointed that they didn't have any fried plantains.  How do you not have plantains at a Haitian restaurant??!!  They have 3-4 type of rice, legum, chicken in sauce, sòs pwa, pikliz, macaroni au gratin and griyo.  Everything I tried tasted good.  They serve Haitian cola/Couronne in a pitcher at the table. There was a separate table/area with desserts.  By the time I made it there, they were out of almost everything.  I really wanted some fresh fruits, but they never brought new ones out.  Overall, food and service was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. I love Creole food and I always make it a point to eat some once a month. My first experience here merits a solid 5 stars.  I had some apprehension coming here. The area looks real ghetto but once I walked through the door I was surprised to see how nice this resto was! We were greeted warmly by the waitress and were seated promptly. The resto was modern and clean with it being half full of hungry patrons.  I ordered their lunch special of Griot (pork), riz collé and plantain. We also ordered a pitcher of fruit Champagne to share. My meal with the drink came to a total of $11... which is very reasonable.  Service was great. Very friendly and service was fast.  Food was delicious.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Are you hungry? Are you really hungry?   Go there to eat until your heart content because it is really filling. I mostly order takeout and I am always stuffed. I beg my boyfriend not to bring me there too much because you can seriously gain weight, then again, it is really good for a decent price. They have a lunch special from 11 am to 4 pm, where you get a big plate filled with rice (or sticky rice), plantain with a choice of meat (chicken, turkey, gruau, vegetable, lamb) ranging from 7,99 to 15$. If you add a drink, it comes to about 10 to 15$ depending on the plate you choose.   The customer service is pretty good. The person taking your order is always polite and smiling. The wait can be long because they take the time to cook it after I order, I think I wait about 10 minutes to 15 minutes for my food. A 20$ for one person can go a long way there.   I defiinitely will come back to the restaurant."}
