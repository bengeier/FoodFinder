{"text":"Visited this past weekend & was sick with likely a food borne illness. We also had a somewhat rude server, even though it was my girlfriend & my birthday no special treatment.  Recommend to visit Pan next door, much higher quality food, service & entertainment.  If you wish to risk eating there,  stay away from all dips (hummus, tzaziki or shared appetizer plate)."}
{"text":"We ordered a $100 meal from Uber Eats and were extremely disappointed. There were two salads missing, no salad dressing with the large greek salad we did get, and the Octopus Riganato's portion size was pathetic, at best. I've ordered from other greek restaurants on the Danforth (Pantheon, Omonoia, etc.) and the portions were way more generous. I gave this restaurant two stars because the three dips we ordered were decent and the potatoes were pretty good. Would maybe give the restaurant another chance for a visit in person, but will not be ordering delivery ever again."}
{"text":"Christina's use to be our families favorite restaurant on the danforth. WOW how things have changed. Food was gross probably the worst experience that i have ever had there. It was truly disappointing. Not only was the food a joke, our waitress was an even bigger JOKE! She literally questioned our ability if we would be able to finish our food. All night she was throwing these sarcastic comments our way. Not enjoyable when you are paying over 150.00 on a night out. 
Not sure if i will be returning if this is how things have changed around there."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best! EVERYTHING was mediocre from the drinks to our over salted food. The only thing that was on point was my company and the band."}
{"text":"The rude waiter served my friend flat beer and me wine that had clearly gone off (tasted like vinegar). We asked for something else instead, then the manager came out and told us to leave."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after trying the fried calamari at Taste of Danforth. Poor judgement on my part. 

Walked in and was acknowledged by the server that was on his way to deliver some food to the patio. Came back after his task and seated us inside but close to the patio.

We ordered the fried calamari to start. Chicken and pork souvlaki dinner as mains. Bread basket was dropped off while we waited. A third of the way through the plate of calamari, my companion spat out some substance that looked like crustacean shells or thin plastic. I alerted the server, he looked at the plate and said \"It's the nerves from the calamari, it's not plastic,\" set down the plate and left. No apology, didn't ask what he could do for us since we're clearly not happy with the food. After that complaint the server avoided all eye contact and even walked AROUND the wall to deliver food to the patio so he didn't have to walk pass our table. 

The chicken was tasteless, I'm not sure if they even have spices in that kitchen. Half the rice was undercooked and hard. The potatoes were nothing to write home about. As my companion reached the last portion of the pork souvlaki it was nothing but fat! UGH!

The prices at this place are ridiculous. Our total bill came to $60. That's way too expensive for such mediocre food.

The only good thing, if it's important to you, is that portion size is pretty big. But when it's bad food is that really a plus?

In summary: Don't ever step foot in here. Bad service and food!"}
{"text":"3 of us ate lunch there today.  Very nice casual ambience.  The bruscheta (tomato and feta) on pita was absolutely amazing. It was the best bruscheta any of us had ever had. We each ordered different lunch specials, and all were excellent.  The Bifteki was the best of the 3 dishes but all were good.  The vegetarian moussaka, the pork souvlaki and the Bifteki were all well worth the price, and quite enjoyable, and the service was attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the First time last night, my husband I enjoyed it so much! Both food and service were wonderful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for some fish and rice based on a recommendation. The red snapper was very good. Service was decent, not super friendly but pretty on the ball. The atmosphere is a bit dark, but it's definitely a neighborhood spot as by the time we  finished eating it was almost packed and pretty lively. Not sure how this stacks up against some of the other places on the street, but I had a great meal tonight."}
{"text":"Dropped in for Dinner on Saturday night. We ordered appetizers and the Chicken and Lamb Souvlaki dinners for main course.  The lamb was ordered as medium to well done.   

The appetizers were good except for the Dolmades which looked like they were quickly put together and not wrapped tightly. 

Our main course was the real issue.  The Chicken Souvlaki seem to not to be completed cooked since the texture was not well done.

As for the Lamb Souvlaki, a number of pieces were raw.  It was so raw I was not able to cut through it with my knife.  I did bring it to the attention of the waiter and he did offer to get them to make me another one which I did not make sense to me since I had already eaten half of the Souvlaki. To add to the disappointment, no apologies from management or the waiter and no offer for a discount.  

It was a Saturday night, but when we got there the restaurant was not packed.  There is no excuse for serving raw meat, especially on a Souvlaki.  This points to a problem in Christina's kitchen and I would recommend avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to place for Greek food on the Danforth, however we visited this place after a few years and I'm sad to say the quality has dropped dramatically. The waiter kept mixing up our order and wouldn't even apologize for it. The stuffed chicken was cold and the grilled squid they brought me was practically burnt. The chicken and the lamb souvlakis were so blan my two companions didn't even finish their food. Sad to say, but I don't think I will be going back to Christina's again. Everything looked so dated and flimsy, this restaurant used to be hip and bustling with people!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the patio with a friend. Amazing food...delish almost fluffy homemade tzaziki, marinated souvlaki, grilled vegetarian platter were all awesome! Service was very good too- not overbearing just polite and attentive. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Christina's is one of those gems that can easily be missed because it's nestled in amid the vibrancy that is the Danforth. Their breakfast at is definitely a great find, and rumour has it that weekend evenings feature bellydancing performances.  Dine on the patio to enjoy prime people watching in the busy Greek neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. One of the few authentic Greek restaurants left on the Danforth. I've been coming here for years and the food has always been great. 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We saw many 5 star reviews so we decided to try it out. Went with a bigger group and made reservations in advance. Took almost 2 hours to get a basket of bread and our drinks after asking numerous times. 

We have had Greek food all over the city and in many parts of Greece and this was bad!! The food quality was subpar, bad cuts of meat and overpriced for what they are offering in the neighbourhood. $30 for a poorly put together set of dips that were not very good is a thumbs down. 

Most of the staff were difficult to say the least. There are \"doers\" and there are people who always say \"can't\", this is one of those places. 

The chef's should be replaced for the quality of the food they put out as it is neither appealing to the eye, nor can they cook Greek food. Of course, this all starts from the top. 

Lastly, the bathrooms were located in the basement, which is fine, but the floors were extremely wet and slippery just off of the staircase, no wet floor signs anywhere in sight. Lawsuit waiting to happen here."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place from a Greek acquaintance. Loved it! Atmosphere was jolly and cozy. We went on a sat night. The bellydancing and live music is great. We had the grilled calamari (around $15-18, i forgot) and the roasted lamb rack ($34). Calamari was great and freah, lamb rack was excellent, flavorful and savory. The house wine ($9 glass) was very good as well, and the bread they serve u is excellent, with some good garlic-butter on it. I would definitely definitely come back. I didnt give 5 stars just because I feel i should try more dishes and as well my bf didnt think the calamari compared to other calamari on the danforth as it lacked some flavours, altho to me i thought it was still delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by one Sunday afternoon for the lunch special food was a great price and service was a bit slow but it was over a good Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"With all the talk and planning for our trip to Greece, my parents and I had a craving for Greek food. We always love coming to Christina's because the food is actually very good. We have been to the Mezes and the Ouzeri's on the Danforth, and sometimes, they can be all talk and no good? The only caveat to all this was the fact that Christina's was a spur of the moment decision...at 8pm on Friday...on the Danforth. We nearly gave up because parking was a zoo (the only reason why we don't come to the Danforth more...) But fate was on our side and we got parking 2 minutes away from the restaurant!

Food. My family and I love ALWAYS order the Maralousalata which is the healthiest salad ever...leaves, lemon, olive oil, and chopped green onions for bite. Something so simple but so delicious. This salad is meant for sharing which is perfect. I always order their fresh sea bass selection (be sure to place your order as soon as you sit, because sometimes by the time you get to ordering, the fish can be gone!) My dad always orders the lamb chop (appetizer portion) but 3 at a time so in fact it's almost a meal...this leaves room for him to also enjoy the Maralousalata, roasted potatoes and dolmades (meat stuffed in grapevine leaves). But these food items are just a sliver of what Christina's offer...the menu is extensive and if my dishes are good, than I am sure other dishes at this restaurant are delicious as well.

Drinks. We also decided to order a bottle of red and the waiter introduced us to a Greek red. We were apprehensive at first as the wines from Greece we tried were bitter, but our waiter assured us that this red was the best selling wine in the restaurant...in fact, in Paris, this was the most popular wine there was. Sold!

The wine was called Estate Hatzimichalis and it was exceptional. Only $42 for the bottle, it tastes like Welchs grape juice, but with alcohol! Not sure if I am selling it here, but what I am trying to say is this red is fruity, delicious, and not heavy which is a better option if you're having heavier Greek fan fare.

Ambiance. On Friday nights, any restaurant on the Danforth would be busy, so patios are out of the question if you don't make reservations or come right at the start of dinner time. Inside the restaurant is dark and long but lots of room. There is also belly-dancing which I did not know was Greek, but all of a sudden, loud, disco Greek music blares out from the radio and this tiny girl in belly-dancing gear gyrates her hips...and so starts the performance (no smoke included...thank goodness). One act has her cover her head in a black cloth and she continues to gyrate up and down tables...asking anyone if they want to dance... (my dad kindly declined...)

Service is great. We always have the same waiter so it's pleasant...and he knows what we like so no menu needed for us.

All in all, try Christina's...if not for the belly dancing. The food is good, and the price not exorbitant. A meal for 3 including a bottle came out to less than $200."}
{"text":"An Outstanding Dining Experience.  My four siblings and I were recently in Toronto enjoying some family bonding time.  After a full day of walking our footsore group came to Christina's for dinner based on the recommendation of a friend in Washington DC.   After we were gratefully seated outside my sister Liz, who had been craving a gyro, was very disappointed when she realized this offering was not on the menu.  Seeing her distress our server, Miltos, went above and beyond to procure a gyro from another neighborhood eatery and presented it to Liz as an \"on the house\" offering. Our group ordered several appetizers and entrees from the Christina's menu that were all were all fantastic!

Miltos was friendly, gracious and very kind.  He did a wonderful job making our meal a memorable event right down to having his photo taken with our group.  We truly enjoyed the outstanding service and great food!
 
We left Christina's as group of very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Entrés pas hasard, nous a on été agréablement surpris. La cuisine est authentique et les plats sont goûteux, la clientèle constituée d'habitués. En plus il y avait un groupe qui jouait de la musique grecque en live. Dépaysement assuré."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! It has amazing food and customer service. The place is beautiful and authentic looking. Took my mother here for mothers day and it was perfect. Despite being completly packed they were quick to bring us appetizers, salad and our meal. We did not have to wait on anything. We were checked on throughout but not so much that it was annoying. Just the perfect amount in case we needed anything. The food was delicious. They bring you garlic bread. We had taramasolata to start. I got the roasted lamb but I should have order the whole rack option because I feel I didn't have enough meat but that's my own fault. The meat was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were literally amazing."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had outside Greece!  

I'm half Greek and have been to Greece several times, and this place reminded me of my family's restaurant in Athens.  None of the places I've been to in Chicago (where I'm from) have the combination of authenticity and overall taste that this place does.

The horiatiki salad, kolokithokeftedes (zucchini cakes), saganaki, and tzatziki were all great, but hands down the best thing I tried was the paidakia (lamb chops): they were extremely tender and succulent without being overly fatty.  

Atmosphere was both classy and casual, with sidewalk seating and an open porch."}
{"text":"As someone who lives a couple of blocks from the Danforth who has frequented most of the Greek restaurants on the strip, I was pleased to have better than average souvlaki on a nice patio.  With pleasant efficient service, my recent visit to Christina's was an overall good experience.  Prices are reasonable.  While we ate outside, the interior is very nice and is a good option when it's not patio weather.  Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Love the food. They really have the Greek flavours right. I would just say the waitresses will take awhile to come back and check on you when the restaraunt begins getting busy !"}
{"text":"Very warm and nice Greek Restaurant. The staff are very friendly. The food is very delicious. We ordered Mousaka and Lamb Kebob.

Mousaka was amazing, the lamb kebob was unbelievable and delicious,

they serve garlic bread for the table and greek salad before the main dish.

We also ordered gilled octapus, that was amazing as well.

The food was great, authentic and high quality and it is a must try."}
{"text":"Christina's is lovely. It has a very homey, familiar vibe. The flavours and scents slowly captivate your senses as you're led to your table.

We started off the night with the assorted dip... it was very difficult to control myself. Home-mate tzatziki, hummus, olives, melitzanosalata.... All with freshly made pita. And the tiropita! Cheese pie with feta and herbs wrapped in filo pastry and served with tomato sauce. I didn't really make that much of a dent in my entrée since I'd stuffed myself with the starter courses.

There is definitely a return visit in the works."}
{"text":"Finally!!! After years of telling me about his favourite greek place my husband finally convinced me to come give Christina's a try. I am so glad I was down!

The atmosphere is so friendly and lively! Definitely adds to the greek feel. When you first walk in to the dining room theres a wall with pictures posted showing all the different notable people who have visited. Makes a good time killer while waiting.The service isn't the best, it's hard to find you server after you order so make sure you have everything you need when you order. They are nice but they ghost you very quick!I 

This was my first time having Saganaki and I was so excited! Unfortunately, my husband was so enveloped in his phone that the server was trying to be nice and waited to long so we didn't really get a \"flaming\" experience- more like a little spit of a ring of fire. However, that's more of a husband fault then a restaurant fault. Even though I didn't get the flames like the other table- it was super delicious! Like I want to come back and eat some now. I ordered the Kotopoulo Yemisto, I didn't like it. It was so over filled with Spinach I didn't even taste the cheese and herbs it supposedly came with (Im sure it didn't actually have any of that) However, my husbands chicken souvlaki was so good! We ended up switching plates and that is my new thing to order when we come back. The tzatziki sauce was especially delicious and something you definitely should ask more fof."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice. The food was good. We order the lamb and salmon and it was delicious. The belly dance makes it more lively. The only thing stop us from a 5 star was the service was slow. It took 10 min before the waiter came to serve us."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly one of my favourite Greek Restaurants in the Danforth area.  We always have a great experience when we go there, food is always meets our expectations. There service is not always the best, can't figure that out.
I always tend to lean towards fish, calamari, pork or the chicken, greek style. Sometimes, they have sardines, then i am in heaven. My wife tends to go for the lamb, most of the time. Regardless, the food is excellent.
The atmosphere, I love. Just the perfect amount of ambience and the busy-ness, enough to enjoy the moment.
I would like to give a 5, but the service is either a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants on the Danforth! These guys know how to take care of you. Great hospitality, even better menu!"}
{"text":"Great service but I found the food too salty for my liking. I also found that they were a bit heavy handed with their lemon on the potatoes that accompanied their soulvaki platter.  Fried calamari was fair but a bit greasy."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. The waitress messed up our order and another person in our party didn't enjoy her salad. When we complained the waitress eventually admitted a mistake with my order and offered to replace it but the manager had to be called for the salad incident. He ended up telling us to leave without any explanation and started clearing our plates before even giving us a chance to decide if we wanted to stay. We have never been embarrassed like this or been treated in such a rude way. We will never be returning or recommending it to any of our friends."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch and I've already really enjoyed it. Great spot in the summer as they have a decent sized patio. 

Their brunch menu is really well priced, you can grab typical brunch food (omelettes, eggs benny, etc) or they have a separate lunch menu with Greek items (spanokopita, bifteki, souvlaki, etc). Most items are priced between $9-$12 so 2 can dine for $30 including coffee, tax and tip.

Service is sometimes borderline (slow, but not slow enough to freak out)"}
{"text":"This place has seen better days. It's dafed and old. And desperately needs an overhaul. 
The food is subpar / the pork souvlaki was tough as leather. It came with bland rice and the usual \"Greek\" boiled potatoes.
Nothing like getting a glass of water after asking the rude servers a few times over.
The bendy stew in all the drinks will give you an idea of how classy the place is  (or lack thereof) ...
Live keyboard and singer started at 9pm and it was noisy and invasive. 
The bathroom .... The trail of toilet paper draped going up the stairs is your warning of what's to come. The washroom .... A gas station bathroom smells better than this one!
Yellowed and stained toilet seats ... The basement smells like a mildewed cave. 
The service is slow .... 
Hanging wires all over the walls. Dusty and lopsided pictures and wall fixtures. THe decor can loosely be described as \"garage sale grab bag\" 
I would never ever recommend this place. 
Its so overpriced. What a crap-hole."}
{"text":"Okay. I know I gave Christina's a very poor review, based on a visit there from many years ago. Today, my friend and I were walking the Danforth, looking for a place to have lunch. We were still stinging from our dreadful Pan experience and when we got to Christina's, my friend suggested we try it. Because time had passed, I thought why not and in we went. And I am very glad we did!

We both had the Vegetarian Moussaka and it was amazing!! Also, the service was so much better than I experienced before. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. This time, we weren't left sitting there forever, being ignored. I don't know if the management has changed or they just cleaned up their act but whatever it is, it's working and we will definitely be back come summer, to enjoy their front patio.

I'm glad now I gave them a second chance because it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a friend who I hadn't seen in ages. As he spoke fluent Greek and I did not, I'm basing this review on my observations.

Nice, quiet, casual atmosphere. No complimentary bread or Pita which was a surprise to both of us.

I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki which given the competition wasn't over the moon fantastic but did satisfy my craving. The chicken was tender at times, once again not the best not the worst. Also it wasn't overly seasoned; therefore, relatively bland. The potatoes and rice that come with it were A-OK.

Waiters were attentive but not hovering. Price point was reasonable.

If you're looking for somewhere quiet on the Danforth, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"\"So we've never been here before. How's the food?\"

Pause. Little smile. \"No complaints unless you complain. How does that sound?\"

Not good, but it was already 2:20 p.m., we'd been turned away from our neighbourhood favouite Mocha for lack of space, and we were STAR VING. So we stayed and allowed ourselves to be seated in their bland Mediterranean-style dining area.

The menu has split personality: half Greek, half greasy spoon. We finally decided on the brunch menu only to notice that it was supposed to have ended 3 minutes earlier, but the waiter was cool and let us order off the brunch menu anyway.  My Villager omelet (feta, onion, green pepper) was nice and light, but the whole wheat toast was made with boring bread out of a bag. The highlight of the meal had to be the hash browns: instead of piling on a giant helping of mushy or overly brown spuds, Christina's gives you a small serving of six or seven beautifully prepared, rosemary-infused potato pieces, lightly browned but crispy and delicious. Perfect. 

On the down side, the decor was dull verging on depressing, and the wait staff, though nice and flexible on brunch times, had no panache. 

We'll probably try Christina's once more to give the Greek half of the menu a chance, but unless our experience is super wow I can't see us making it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Haven't been back in the last year as the last time we went the food and service were awful.

A group of us ventured to Greektown for a friends birthday. A friend (not in attendance)had recommended this restaurant so we thought this would be an excellent opportunity to try the place out, while indulging in one of our favorite foods.

We arrived without reservations (a group of 14) but managed to get in. Truthfully, after our experience, I wish they had told us that they couldn't accommodate us, so we would have gone elsewhere.

Where things went wrong:
1) Waitress was rude and surly. Was not friendly and was a full blown b-i-a-t-c-h.
2) Drink order was screwed up (although she refused to write anything down as she had an \"awesome\" memory)
3) Bread brought out for our table (group of 14) with only enough for 6 people. We asked for more and was told that she'd have to charge us for it. Odd, because if we were seated separately, we would have all had bread.
4) The person's whose birthday we were there to celebrate did not get her meal. The waitress with the \"awesome\" memory, forgot to order it.
5) Food was cold....we called over our waitress to complain that the potatoes that came with the meal were cold. Her response was \"That's the way we serve them here\". Really? Who serves cold potatoes with a Soulvaki dinner? Meat was overcooked and flavourless, as well as being cold.
6) Dirty dishes sat in front of us far too long before they were cleared.
7) Final insult....when the bill arrived there was an automatic 15% gratuity added on (as we were a party larger than 8). While I usually have no issues tipping for service, this particular person did not earn or deserve a 15% tip...so we called over the manager to explain our dilemma. We were told that despite our experience, their server warranted the gratuity and we had to pay it. We paid the bill in full and left...all vowing never to return. And we haven't......."}
{"text":"food was terrible...the food tasted more Middle Eastern than Greek, i wondered if i was being served by Greeks or Muslims

I had the kotopoulo (chicken) with rice and \"greek\" potatoes

just another in a long line of greek restaurants that seem to be shifting to \"mediterranean\" (middle-eastern)...its sad, and Im tired of it

it is also expensive, not worth the price

i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 though, because the service was excellent...had a waiter standing a few feet away from us almost the entire time, so it was easy to get stuff quick

danforth is deteriorating"}
{"text":"Brunch review only.  Absolute crap food, embarrassingly bad; limp french toast, anemic omelet, soggy overcooked potatoes.  Worst of all: the service.  Nearly empty restaurant yet we got our food after tables arriving after us. Confused inattentive service, could not even get the bill, had to ask twice, contemplated dine and dash.  Truly shockingly bad, never ever again for any meal ever for any reason.  Food and service pure garbage."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday lunch with a large group for a celebration. If it wasn't for the group of friends I was with, I probably would've been more frustrated than I was. I've had bad service before but this one took it to another level.

Staff: It is a problem when the restaurant is empty and yet my entire party has no water in their glasses for 90% of the entire meal. They did not come and check out party at all during our entire meal. To start, we had to frantically wave multiple times before we got to order. I had to physically go up to the front counter to ask if someone could bring us water on multiple occasions. And when we were done, we had to go up and get the attention of our waiter when we wanted our bill. I have had better service from the self-checkout line at a grocery store!

Ambience: The place had nice décor. It was quiet, because the restaurant only had a few people. Be advised the stairs to the washroom are uneven. They also didn't turn on the lights to the back half the restaurant and we were seated next to that section so it was pretty dark since there aren't a lot of windows either. I will say if you were seated in the front section, it would've been better.

Food: I had the Keftedes to start, which are meatballs with tomato sauce, which were pretty good. They were soft and warm and seasoned well. I also then had the chicken pasta as a main. I was really disappointed because the pasta tasted salty and dry. I have had Greek food many times in the past and I've never had it this bad when it came to an entrée. The chicken was definitely on the drier side as well. Essentially, appetizer was great, main was bad. But the portions were nice.

To sum it up, the service was non-existent which is something silly because we were a large party. Food was not great, except for the meatballs, but there are so many other establishments that have better food. I am normally willing to give restaurants another shot, but this is one of the rare occasions where I will probably not come back at all."}
{"text":"We started with the 3 dip appetizer and I need to note that my husband and I think Christina's tzatziki was the best ever! It's got a noticeable amount of dill in it and it is  tasty!!!! The other dips were good but we were busy fighting for the tzatziki. 
I had moussaka and he chose lamb- we shared them both and couldn't figure out which we enjoyed more. They were both very enjoyable and we cleaned our plates! The flavors were fresh and balanced and authentic.  
We were the only table seated inside on a lovely summer weekday evening (there were a lot of smokers on the patio and we wanted to put some distance between us and the second hand smoke). I think that being inside put us at a disadvantage for service. The staff was attentive until we ordered and then we were hardly even acknowledged except when something was being delivered to our table. After our empty dinner plates were removed we waited, without ANY acknowledgement for 25 minutes. We had planned to order dessert but no one ever stopped at our table, despite going right past us to the patio. It was so weird!! I finally took my credit card out and waved someone down and we left without dessert. The prices were on the high end of reasonable but the food was great and we overall enjoyed our meal! I imagine that dessert would have been good, too..."}
{"text":"Good service, great saganaki, souvlaki was a bit bland but its overall worth a shot."}
{"text":"Cute little Greek spot on the famous Danforth. It was a breezy summer evening so I opted for a table on the patio for myself and two friends. 
We were greeted promptly. Service was quick - I ordered a chicken souvlaki plate. 
It was well-seasoned and the potatoes were salty - just the way I like it. 
Portion sizes are smaller than Astoria but I honestly didn't mind. The flavors are all on point. 
Very nice summer patio spot."}
{"text":"Picture this. Saturday night, midnight. Just had a super long day and just wanting to eat geek with le boyfriend. We felt adventurous and wanted to try something than our normal - 3 restaurants. To our surprise this restaurant was still open and more than willing to serve us.

We sat down on the patio because it was such a beautiful night. Looked at the menu (let me point out le boyfriend is extremely picky) and we both decided that the Mediterranean Seafood Platter for two is the choice that we wanted to go with. 

After the waiter had taken our order he had brought over the drinks and the bread. Pre buttered with fresh garlic butter - le boyfriend is celiac so he took the risk of eating it (8 hours later we found out he doesn't react to that bread which is FANTASTIC) he couldn't stop because it was sooo delicious.

The food came out. Beautiful presentation and everything tasted excellent. The salmon and white fish was cooked to perfection. The shrimp and the lobster tail was a little on the dry side however none the less still very appetizing. This spot has been added to our go-tos list. 

Also the service was wonderful. Very pleasant and efficient, thank you for a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Service is warm and friendly however the food is JUST okay.... prices are quite high for the portion sizes.  We had the pork souvlaki dinner, very small portion only one skewer a small scoop of rice and two potatoes. We also tried the zucchini tower which was fried slices atop a pile of garlic COLD mashed potatoes . I was told that the cold mashed is the way it is meant to be served but wasn't a fan of the flavour the crispy pieces of zucchini are delicious but the thicker cut pieces are very mushy and not as enjoyable. Overall the ambiance and service was amazing but we probably won't be back for anything but drinks"}
{"text":"We made the trek to Danforth after seeing a BNL concert at Massey Hall. We were looking for late night food in a fun atmosphere to keep the great evening going and Christina's did not disappoint. We were seated promptly and happened on the Saturday live music crowd. It felt like were were transported to a taverna in Greece. Spanakopita is a fall back of mine but... wow! This was almost like a soufflé; it was light and custardy... delicious. The feta in general was creamy and light and less salty than I've had. My boyfriend had the lamb meatballs in a tomato sauce that had us dunking everything we could find in it... potatoes, rice, bread... you name it, we dunked it! It was just a great late dinner all the way around..."}
{"text":"Very original Greek fare.  My moussaka was tasteless.  Also my husband's cod was bland.  He asked for lemon...didn't help.  Seems to be a local hangout people watching place.   Staff friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best place to hang out with your friends on a Friday night. Best live greek music, amazing food, and a nice atmosphere for dancing and enjoying a good time with friends"}
{"text":"I rarely give any restaurant 1/5, but this one deserves it. 

I went here with a group of friends for lunch, during \"taste of the danforth\".  The power went out twice during our meal.  The food was garbage.  I paid $20 for a chicken shwarma shishkabob and fries.  It was horrendous, seriously you can give this stuff for much cheaper ANYWHERE else.  Just go to a food court and you'll get better quality food. 

The waiter was arrogant, snarky, and had no conversation or people skills.  He also refused to separate the bill for us. 

They had some dancer in there, which was just chessy.  Nothing to impress anyone with.  

Maybe I had a bad experience because it was during Tase of the Danforth?  Who know... but this place sucks.

{"text":"This is one place you should consider for a date. Food is prepared fresh and taste good ( not super good) waiters knows the food they r serving and that's very important. 
On weekends you will have your dinner with a live music.
Price wise it's a little above the average.
It's spacious and clean. The atmosphere is nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've been to Christina's for three times so far, and we always end up having a great time at this little gem on the Danforth.

The Food is delicious, always fresh and nicely presented..
With a menu that has a wide selection of vegetarian options, seafood, lamb/beef and poultry..
They also offer sharing platters which are just great for larger groups.

Lamb souvlakis, grilled calamari, saganaki are my star plates in here, but the whole menu is pretty well prepared.

The staff and management are actual professionals, not your regular servers, which is great plus to have, they will all make sure you're always looked after and leaving the place a happy customer.

On weekends (fri&sat), they feature a live band and singers, singing classic and modern greek songs..
The place is usually packed, especially on weekends, so it's a must to make reservations to secure a spot."}
{"text":"A bad experience leaves a long lasting impression.  We had a birthday party here and the staff were rude to the guest who was celebrating!  They basically wanted to clear the table out so that they could bring in more people.  I appreciate wanting to do a brisk business but not at the expensive of making your customers feel horrible.  The place was dark and overcrowded.  As for food selections, you can find better selection in the nearby restaurants since this area is filled with restaurants with better Greek food.  

I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Solid favorite on the Danforth.  Sometimes its a little slow on service and maybe not as tidy as it could be but food doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I do not typically rate restaurants. But this Greek owner was too rude not to warn other families. Very poor service and horrible place for young families. Greek owner was tremendously unaccommodating. Stay away!"}
