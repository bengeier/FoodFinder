{"text":"BEST LOUNGE/GAME ROOM IN TOWN....heck, it's the most down to earth & fun place in LA/OC or Las Vegas.  The ability to socialize with a variety of people, listen to live music, play a variety of fun FREE games is all right in one location.  Good drink prices, plenty of space and no attitudes.  FYI, I have been to this place 3 times and each time, I have a good time."}
{"text":"great bar! super fun for bigger groups. all the outdoor games are really cool and the cafe was surprisingly good. drinks can sometimes be inconsistent though."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out and have a few drinks, play some cool games and eat some great food, what's not to like about it?  Best part here is the customer service we received from Annemarie in the restaurant every morning.  Tons of fun, great personality and she felt like part of the team after one day.  We were there for three days for a sales meeting and wish we had an Annemarie at every establishment...Big Kudos, definitely recommend this place for a good time."}
{"text":"This review is for the Grill at the Gold Spike.  We just finished having a late breakfast here, and I couldn't be happier with our choice.  Our server, Angelina, was so incredibly friendly and patient with our questions, and make absolutely sure that all of our food was compliant with our various dietary restrictions.  She was attentive and funny, and you would be lucky to have her as your server.!  Also, the chef, Don, even came out of the kitchen to talk to us and make sure that the dish would come out exactly like we wanted it.   Awesome service by both of them!!  The food is really good as well, a great alternative to the myriad of greasy, fried, fatty, bloating options in the area.  Try the steak loin salad, it's delicious and won't make you feel like you need a nap after.  Prices are more than fair for what you get as well.  For a relaxed breakfast/lunch spot with great service and healthier options, definitely give The Grill a shot!"}
{"text":"Should've Gave A Review When I Went But This Place Was Awesome!! I Didn't Have Any Cash To Pay The Cover Fee For My Boyfriend (Which Was Like $10 That Night) But They Had 3 Or 4 ATMs Inside That Only Charged Me $3. Pretty Good For Vegas If You Ask Me. Drinks Were On Point And AMAZING. Dance Floor Was Roomy And There's More Space Outside. Also Love The Games That They Have. Wish San Diego Had A Place Like This!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're looking for entertainment! Pool tables, corn bags, shuffle board, darts, comfy seating. It's bar food with a good set up. I recommend ypu try it!"}
{"text":"Last night my friends and I went out to the goldspike, I had a little bit to much to drink. I waited outside for my friends. Howard from security was really nice and helpful. He gave me water, napkins and his business card.   I recommend this place to everyone.   Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Stumbled into the Gold Spike this weekend and was blown away by how clean and inviting it is!  Enjoyed a drink at the bar while watching folks playing pool and generally lounging around in a smoke-free environment.  I particularly enjoyed the couch/bed that sports a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey on the nightstand.  I will definitely be coming back--a really nice place to relax and enjoy the downtown scene."}
{"text":"Had a great time super fun place to chill bit most all had the most amazing service I've had anywhere in vegas if you ever go ask for Bethany she is hands down one of the best bartenders I've ever had weather in Miami or LA or vegas awesome girl"}
{"text":"How can you not love a place with:   - A Giant Jenga Game -  An  Enormous Connect 4 Game -  A Huge Beer Pong Game (seriously, if the rules applied, you'd die) -  A bed in the middle of the room -  Bean Bag chairs...everywhere (giant ones too)  It's a bar, cafeteria, game zone-- It was crazy fun!!!    ...and they have a cooperative co-working environment I plan to check out very soon.  #VegasTech #DowntownProject"}
{"text":"Annemari was AWSOME.... She's super personable and a gnarly chick!!!!!  Get a DJ on Sunday's and promote a Sunday Funday...."}
{"text":"Angelina was the best server EVER! She is so personable and so sweet! We went to life is beautiful festival and stayed at the hotel, ate at the grill the entire stay because of Angelina! I look forward to seeing her next year when we come back again for the festival! Thanks Angelina! YOUR AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Gold Spike Grill is a great diner in downtown Las Vegas.  The food and the interior design are simple and refined.  April and Morgan are some outstanding servers.  They handle the morning shift with aplomb and skill.  April is a tall redhead who is very gregarious.  She is the kind of redhead that would make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window, as Raymond Chandler would say.  Morgan is an elder stateswoman of the restaurant.  She handles and executes service promptly.  She excludes gracefulness covering all the tables.  Tony and the Downtown Project are lucky to have them.    My only suggestion is adding strawberries to the steel cut oatmeal.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I love the vibes and games available here but the drinks are horrible and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The brain child of Tony Hsieh from Zappos it has all the elements of down-to-earth fun and is my new favorite hangout! From the casual chic decor to the oversized games there is something for everyone. Best of all - it's all ages until about 10pm and then at night there is great music both inside and outside with a live band out back where you'll find a year-round \"ice\" skating rink, giant beer pong and fire pits.   We popped in three times this weekend: Saturday 7pm - great vibe, not too crowded - mostly families hanging out. We had a drink a the bar while our teen boys played a game of pool. Bartender kept us entertained with the story behind Gold Spike's renovation.  Saturday 10:30pm - ID at the door (21+ only), lots more security, lots more people - crowd was mixed but probably early 30ish.  Sunday 1pm - popped in for another drink to watch some of the game. $7 for a Hoegaarden? Definitely fewer people but pretty chill. Still lots of security about - which is a good thing downtown.  There is a small free parking lot adjacent to GS off of LV Blvd & Ogden but if we didn't find a spot there would have just parked under the Neonopolis which is just across the street.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bar tenders only serve one area and don't know how to serve people in order, waited  20 min and watched the bar tender serve people from the same small section over and over and ignore everyone else. The night before I was at a club on the strip and they were better than these guys and 10x busier. Learn how to serve all your customers equally."}
{"text":"If you want to get cheated out of your money then go here.  I got only 6 beers and one shot the whole night and somehow my bill was $80. Each beer is $6.50 and a shot is $8.50.. you do the math. As soon as I seen my bill I waited for the bartender to come around and she didn't come around to contest it. What I am saying is they have 4 bartenders just throwing drinks on people's tabs and expect you to pay for it. And they tooked advantage of me because I had a credit card. NEVER coming here again!!"}
{"text":"You can drink and play games with friends for hours. Awesome music, delicious drinks, and good food too! They have a little 'cafe' in the corner away from the bar and noise. It was a little weird getting your picture taken when you were carded in though, and a lot of staff seemed to be confused about pricing & usage policy on pool tables (I'm guessing because it changes depending on how busy they are). Parking around the area is also a little tricky, but it's downtown. Overall, great fun."}
{"text":"These guys were absolutely harassing us and Anne Marie took care of it she is amazing! The bar staff is great and everyone that works here is five star especially Anne Marie!"}
{"text":"This place is fire! The bartender Bethany is incredible. She's always very sweet to me and I never wait for a drink. I'm flying back out from Ohio just to go see her and party at GoldSpike!! Highly recommend, 5/5"}
{"text":"John H. Is the nicest bartender in Vegas! He cares about what tastes best to you and asks questions to figure out which drink would best suit you. I love him and relax instantly when I see him there!!"}
{"text":"Trying to get id back from paying and take a lil long but had fun had me think of my kid times"}
{"text":"Fun, retro spot in Downtown Las Vegas. Lots of games for adults to enjoy while sipping a drink or five. Excellent place to bring a group of friends for the evening, sometimes can be a wait to get in during peak times."}
{"text":"Awesome music, they had a band outside and a dj inside. Drinks are cheap. They have a food truck, games, and an ice rink. Some dude fought a girl there last night, so that's one of my only complaints.  And the bathroom was packed and gross by the end of the night."}
{"text":"Great place to chill & hang out, close to everything bus, fremont st, indoor/outdoor activities n dj n live music is great, bar service was quick n fast. Had a blast being here"}
{"text":"This place sucks on first Friday the lines are long, unorganized & a hot fcking mess other than that Gold spike is ahhhhmazing & always a good time. Bomb bartenders & quick lines"}
{"text":"Gold Spike has always been a favorite of mine, but tonight, it wouldn't have been as fun without the wonderful service from our bartenders, Brittney and Virginia!!!! They were both very attentive and made our drinks completely the way I asked! It was amazing!!! They were amazing! Their customer service was on point for being such a busy place! Thank you so much ladies! We'll definitely return!!!!"}
{"text":"Board games, table tennis, oversized chess. Pretty cool. A little old and just an okay beer selection, but definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"I was having a really nice night with my friends.  They go here a lot.  I wanted another glass of red wine.  I am local. I rarely go out because I travel for work.   Tonight I could not pronounce Pinot Noir to the bartenders expectations. (Which my spell check just picked up).  I was told I was too drunk and escorted out by a big Samoan man. For no reason at all. This is not the first time this has happened to me at this venue.  I hadn't even had 2 drinks.  Your bar tenders are pushing away good locals.  Born and raised in Vegas, I will never recommend this place again."}
{"text":"The Gold Spike was a surprise!  I thought I was going to get some food in a 24 hour casino diner and boy was I wrong!  It was roller skating night and the back patio was packed with people having fun.  The food was pretty good for late night.  The biggest negative was that the inside bar and dance floor area smells bad."}
{"text":"We all went out the other night and visited Gold Spike. The atmosphere was unique with the oversized outside games. This was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Cute. Reasonable. A $22.00 a day \"resort fee\" is not acceptable. You get a simple room, no phone, no alarm clock but a clean, very comfortable bed and a fairly convenient location."}
{"text":"What a lucky find!  Breakfast was great.  Service was great.  Price was great!  We'll go back, for sure!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I was rejected for my ID being a local 26 year old. Bouncer said it didn't look like me because of my hair and looking younger (4 years ago )   Gave him my TAM and food and Safiya card. Manager who was extremely rude and on the phone with obviously a lady friend glanced at ID and said \"no, not her \". I felt very disrespected and will never support this establishment again and will tell every industry acquaintance and customer that will listen (I work downtown on the weekends) about their horrible customer service.  I was never asked for any type of info on my ID and even gave a second form of PHOTO identification.     Also be known I used to support this establishment and tell other patrons it was a fun establishment. (NOT ANYMORE)"}
{"text":"The one star goes to the horrible customer service from a waitress who works during breakfast time at the restaurant. Her name was Anne Marie, Annemarie or something similar (it's the one with black hair shoulder length). The management definitely has to take her aside and let her know that yelling and being disrespectul with the customers and staff are not acceptable. I took my family for breakfast and the whole experience was just a nightmare. Extremely awful. First of, 9AM and the place was totally empty, all the tables were available, but she asks us to step outside and wait for a table while she was on the phone, nevermind that my 85-year-old grandma was with us. So we waited outside and after like forever, she rudely escorted us to the table making sure to let us know we were a burden for making her work. I don't understand why she had to be so rude and talk so freaking loud when it comes to take our orders. Lady, don't you get that you need us and not the other way around? Secondly, seeing her yelling at the cooks in the kitchen was just horrible. We couldn't enjoy our meals because this creepy waitress kept throwing insults at them very loudly. It was horrifying. Why does she need to treat her coworkers like that? She clearly hates her job and wants everyone to be miserable at this restaurant. We got so disturbed with her sick behavior, totally not acceptable. We will definitely NEVER eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Don't go here sober and whatever you do DO NOT EAT HERE. Within 15 minutes of eating 3 of the 5 of us got sick. The games looked fun but need liquid courage to get started and since the majority of our party got sick from the food we had to leave before we could play anything"}
{"text":"Super fun place if you go in the right time and day. I have been here twice, one being on a Saturday and another on Monday. On Friday and Saturday nights they have live bands playing on the 'backyard' of the place, while they play your typical club music inside. If you go at night on a Saturday, it will probably be packed, both inside and outside, but during the week, it's kind of empty. As a fan of different music genres, I would prefer to go during the days that live bands play. They have quite a few games like Foosball/Football Table, darts, giant beer pong, Giant Jenga, Shuffle Board etc... so if you get tired of dancing or listening to music, you could play some games with your friends. They have quite a few alcoholic drinks, soft drinks etc... overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here because of a cocktail city event, which was super dope! It was my first time here and I can't believe how great this place is and that I've never been here. At first glance from the outside it looks like a run-down spot, but it's way more than that! Good chill vibe, LOT'S of fun games to play in the indoor area (giant connect four, pool tables, dance floor, beds, lounge booths, a bar).. There's also an outdoor area with a roller skating rink, giant jenga, bars, giant beer pong, corn hole, tether ball, and more. $10 cover charge for men (ladies are free). +1 for the good priced drinks since it's downtown and not on the strip. They also have good happy hour deals where most drinks are half off. Highly recommend for date night/hanging with friends. 5-STAR."}
{"text":"I am the C.O.O./co-founder of Cubic Solutions LV, LLC and have grown up here in las Vegas for 22 years and knowing my high quality restaurants eateries and dine-ins for this establishment takes the cake with service. Immediately I am welcomed to sit anywhere, I am allowed to relax and work if I need to or just enjoy the day within the inside or outside areas. Morgan, April and Monica are by far my favorite of the servers who attended my food and drink needs but they go above any service I've known by asking how my day is going allowing me to speak without judgement and they truely make me feel comfortable by asking questions and listening. They check on my drink constantly and all I can say is WOW. Way to go for setting a new service standard! I will always Conduct my business here and recommend Goldspike to everyone of my clients and employees"}
{"text":"The diner at the Gold Spike is amazing. Monica, April and Morgan are excellent - they took care of me SO many times in the 3 days I was in Vegas at the Gold Spike. Lorenzo and Leon are great chefs - they run great, efficient kitchens that turn out delicious food. Give these guys a raise!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome plae and hidden gem of Las Vegas!! They have FREE games like shuffleboard, bags/cornhole and giant jenga! The drinks are reasonable priced! They have a live band on the weekends most time! Its a great place to lounge and hang out with friends! My only complaint is the lack of gambling...if and when this place gets some slot machines or table games Gold Spike is gonna rocking all week long!!!!"}
{"text":"The guys that work their are so disrespectful! I will never step foot in there again. It was my first time going there and I was lost and I was trying to talk to my husband to figure out what's going on and the guy just closed the curtains right in my face while I was talking to my husband and basically pushed me back and I couldn't find my husband anymore. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. I HATE SEEING ME OR MY HUSBAND DISRESPECTED LIKE THAT. COMPLETE ASSWHOLES!!"}
{"text":"Security is on their A game and there's plenty of them, which makes for a safe environment.  Once you enter there's a dance floor and a DJ booth. Towards the back there are classic carnival games and pool tables. There is also a clean restaurant adjacent to the bar in case you get hungry. There are TV's spread out around this area. If you walk further back you'll exit onto the huge foyer area where there's more games like bean bag toss and a mini stage with live performances.  They did a great job renovating this place and making it a nice little hang out spot.  My only gripe is it can be a little crowded especially in the small bathrooms. However,  they do have a bathroom attendant inside."}
{"text":"Great bar with a great atmosphere!  We like the fact that there are life sized games and the drinks are well made. Location is cool and we always have a good time here. There is plenty of room and if it gets stuffy you may go outside."}
{"text":"Awesome bar with a great vibe amazing people great drinks. Alot of fun with friends and the food is good."}
{"text":"I came here the other night to celebrate a friend's birthday. It's a cool place to hang out. They have tons of games to play. The last time I went was almost a year ago, and they used to have pool tables. I don't know if they took the tables out or if they just chose to move them that day to make a bigger dance floor. The Dj wasn't that great the night we went. I didn't really enjoy the music.   It's a pretty cool place to hang out, but I would not go out of my way to go there. When we left, they forced me to get my hand stamped. I don't know why they did that. I wasn't coming back, but they insisted."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this tricked out playground. I think the name should be \"Games I Like\" and not Gold Spike. What is there not to love about the things to do here! Free wi-fi, pool, tic tac toe, connect four, life sized chessboard, Giant Jenga, beer pong on steroids - and an airstream. I mean, really!   If you're looking for an upscale vibe that's smokefree and ching-ching-ching-slot-machine-ring free, this is the place to be. Drink prices are more strip like and there isn't a happy hour (Damn it, Jim) but the ambiance and free games somewhat make up for it. But, a happy hour would be nice - just sayin!   Food prices are fair - we had a happy grilled cheese that wasn't all that happy (the bread is more like a brioche and the cheese doesn't melt into it very well) and the portobello mushroom sandwich (delicious!). Everything else looked good on the menu and we will definitely go back to try a few of the 50 different sauces available for wings. I don't eat chicken so maybe they will add a popcorn shrimp or something for pescetarians like me.   If you're looking for a place that makes you wish you had a basement - and that basement was a pimped out game room - this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I love hanging out here... Great atmosphere. Very different from the normal vegas feel. The drinks are good, the bartenders are friendly."}
{"text":"Top stay 4 #Millenials and the #YoungAtHeart alike in #LasVegas | Shout to John H at the bar for being so dope! | #CMEshoot @ClutchMasterE"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to work on a project and we drove 23 hours to get here. We were hungry and there just so happened to be a diner here at the Hotel. We were expecting some of the locals here to be a little rude, but to our surprise we got one of the best waiters that we have ever had, David. David is a super awesome guy and we're glad we met him, he always has time to talk to us whether we're stopping to eat or not and he's just a joy to have a conversation with. It's people like him who make us happy and definitely make our 5 week stay here, a pleasure. :)"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the fun atmosphere of good drinks and fun people has been ruined by the absolutely worst DJ's I've ever had to dance too. Their music doesn't flow and it's killed just whatever weird mash ups they've come up with at the time. If they could fix the DJ error it would be a 5 but it's a 1 while they try to figure out music"}
{"text":"Cool place younger crowd compared to a place like Commonwealth, but had a fun time here....!"}
{"text":"The line was pretty full before midnight but after the line died down. I came in expecting a typical bar with a pool table and live sports on tv.  But man was I wrong!   The \"Golden\" part about the place is the outdoor area. They had live music going and cornhole, jenga, and volleyball. The most fun came from 4-square. I think you have to rent the ball but 3 hours flew by with me just being obsessed straying #1.   I met a couple chill people and linked up with them on Facebook. Great times. Without a doubt I'm going back if I'm ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place did very well. My French Dip was delish. And my server... Brittany I think her name was, was very attentive. My drink was always full. Everyone had an awesome personality. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place has many decent bottled craft and imports, yet no beer list. I asked about their Belgian selection and she said Blue Moon. ??? Then I spied a Chimay in the cooler. The server has no clue about beer whatsoever.  Also there was a happy hour special that the bartendress failed to mention. This place has massive potential, management should be ashamed."}
{"text":"so awesome! I love the games and the environment. always fun groups of people"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and great food. I have yet to have a meal there that wasn't delicious and the service only makes it a better experience! April, Morgan, and Monica are beyond awesome: they get to know you after only a couple visits, are super friendly, and keep you laughing the whole time you're there. The three of them go above and beyond service that I've had anywhere else: they are legitimately some of the nicest, most attentive, funniest servers I've known.  I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"Horrible !!!!!!!! Employement scks. Security thinks there hot shit and they just get paid min,wage. Service in general sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Literally an adult playground as others have said. Its best to get your squad here where you can have fun and drinks if you'd like! Friendly staff and nice people to socialize with too (mostly).  Want to build something out of giant legos? Go for it. Test your delicate hands at human jenga? You can do that too. Huge hopscotch and ping pong? Why not? Pool and darts?Yasss!  Anyways, its a fun place to go when in downtown. Give it a try and have fun!"}
{"text":"Great place. Really nice staff. Andy the cashier in front door is really nice, she let me in for free because it was birthday.  She ROCKS."}
{"text":"So I had no idea how much I would love this place and I'm sad I waited so long to go! There are a lot of games to play there, cool seating areas and I dig the chill atmosphere. :) The drinks are reasonably priced and I liked the bartender. Be warned though.. Careful of the giant jenga because I got a pretty bad splinter! It went in kind of deep and I was definitely bleeding. All in all, I had a great time and will go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! What makes it great is miss Angie! She's always one step ahead of you and chatting it up with her made this review 4 stars! The food is superb and the staff makes you want to come back for more. Ask for Willy's chicken Caesar salad wrap! It's not on the menu, but it's so good on a hot summer afternoon."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is awesome! We had a blast. It's a great transition from casino to bar, grill, pool, shuffle board"}
{"text":"Chief and Jordan at the door are the sweetest!!! They always take care of me. Fave place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun! Came to Las Vegas to visit some friends and they took me here. It was very lively and upbeat! There are games, and the music isn't too loud or gangster like I thought it would be. Only reason 4 stars is because the bathroom lines were long every time we went. And traffic/parking is frustrating even on a Wednesday night, the whole reason we came on a weekday. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I've taken my team from work here twice and everyone had a good time. I went again with friends and it was a nice night as well. The thing that makes this place is the back yard. Playing life size Jenga, Connect 4, or Beer Pong gives everyone something to do without awkward lulls in conversation. The music is good too. The last time I was there the waitress did an excellent job. I gave her a max budget and put my card on a tab. She managed a large group and made sure everyone got what they wanted and closed the tab at the limit I set.   No real dance floor but I will dance wherever. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the long wait times at the bar and in the cafe. The wait for a burger averaged 45 minutes which I think is a bit much."}
{"text":"Such a comfortable setting and amazing bartenders/ bar backs. Thank you for a great experience and attentiveness."}
{"text":"may!17 2015  food was off the chain. waitress great service polite. i was very hungry my family abd i love the food here alway."}
{"text":"Wow! The service at the gold spike is FANTASTIC!!!!! I had John as a bartender. He was on point! I didn't know what I wanted and he basically read my mind and made me the perfect drink!! Super friendly  and nice! Great dude!   The food is great, got the french dip the meat was perfectly cooked, the bread was toasted just the way I like it and the fries perfectly seasoned. What a great lunch!  The atmosphere was fun yet relaxed there are games to play, or you can just bring your lap top and work on stuff.   You defiantly need to check this place out!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"if I could give 0 stars I would!!I was super pumped to go here because of the real world and looked like so much fun.  We are greeted(not really) by a bouncer who makes me take my hat off and take a picture(and was super rude about it I felt like a criminal)  The bar promotes a free champagne deal that I wanted to take advantage of.  I walk up to the bar ask the bartender if it's still valid he completely ignores me and walks away give someone a beer and goes to open a champagne and push it towards me without asking me anything.  I was sitting there super confused and amazed someone could be so rude.  First of all I asked about the promotion which didn't mean that I wanted the champagne and he didn't ask me what else he could get for me or anything.  He was so rude!!!  After that I was completely turned off and left the bar(which was very lame btw)  What ever happened to customer service?  Who wants to go to a bar with super rude staff and who takes pictures of you when entering a bar.... Not me!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for some breakfast & a drink. Everything was great & John the bartender was really friendly & courteous!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good food, great place to socialize or sit back with your laptop. I can't wait to attend a party here. Classic games, chill atmosphere.   It's hipster nirvana."}
{"text":"as far as bars go this is pretty much my favorite or 'go-to' place in town to take my friends/guests for a great hang out. on any night OTHER THAN Friday/Saturday this bar is only mildly crowded and gives you a comfortable vibe comparable to being at a good friends house for the first time for a party. since the remodel a couple months ago the place has really stepped it's appearance up and looks more on the classy scale -- but fear not, anyone in casual wear is welcomed in open arms, but be warned, with so many stylish peers you may want to come dressed to impress. with giant chess, beer pong, shuffle board, jenga.. how could anyone get bored here?! and last but not least,  had a few too many extremely generous cocktails??? just have a bite to eat at their diner to sober up before heading out. meal options are average diner plates. overall, a great place to hang. come here, loosen up and have the time of your life!"}
{"text":"Games were run down. I had fun playing darts and tiny big jenga. Overall, good concept but poorly executed. Have yet to try the food."}
{"text":"Hi, I want to say this past Friday night was the first time I actually visited the club on a busy weekend.  What an amazing time!!! The energy level was amazing! The presence of staff/security was great! My friend had lost her cellphone and the security lady by the exit door had it.  She was kind enough to answer the phone when we called it and told us where she was so we could get it.  Awesome time!  Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Had kitty as our waitress again and she was AMAZING so friendly and always gets our order perfect. Made our experience great! food was very nice! Overall 5 stars"}
{"text":"I agree this place has a great vibe and concept but it is a mess worst service ever such a shame!"}
{"text":"good place to just chill with friends at night. very relaxing and they have a variety of games (trash can beer pong, tetherball, twister, shuffleboard, etc.)"}
{"text":"It's a great place to go on the weekend. My favorite part is the diner the food is great, prices are perfect,  and service is amazing.  My favorite server is Kristy."}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot to hang out with friends! It's like a back yard for locals to hang out."}
{"text":"One of my top spots downtown when you want to either get some work done during the day (and not have to purchase expensive coffee to sit down), PLUS they have super fast FREE internet so that always makes working better.   At night you can play giant sized games (like giant connect four, beer pong, and jenga).   Check it out! I can promise you won't be let down."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot. The drinks are fairly priced ($6-8 for wells), there's lot of room, there's games, the music is usually good (inside and outside), there's a food truck, there's plastic skating, and no cover. It gets pretty crowded after 11pm on weekends."}
{"text":"WHAT? We never even got into this place because the security guard told us we had to finish the drinks we bought at another casino before we could go onside. Wait, isn't this Vegas?"}
{"text":"What a great place to have a drink and unwind.  We did not try the food, but had a few drinks and had a great time playing all of the games throughout the lounge.  Giant Jenga, giant pool, corn hole, table tennis, darts, fooz ball are just a few of the games they have.  There is also plenty of sofa and lounge space to relax and have a great conversation.  The atmoshpere and vibe is very unique and creative.  I can't think of any other place in Las Vegas that is similar.  A great place for a date, meeting friends, and even family outing.  It's also within very close walking distance to other Downtown and Fremont Street restaurants/attractions/bars/casinos."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place the last time we were in Las Vegas and thought it was pretty interesting . Nice outdoor seating and fun oversize games.Decent food .  This time we returned with a large group of people to share this experience with .  There were about 8 of us and I entered first no problem . A few more entered no problem .I looked back and noticed a commotion at the door with a few remaining friends . I returned to see what it was all about . I was informed that they needed ID to get in .Being all in out late forties this seemed kind of odd and also no one else was asked for ID when they entered.After some heated discussion with the doorman  we were told this was a rule and he would get the Manger .  As I am standing by the doorman a little guy looking like  Ceasar Milan  \"bar whisperer \" comes out and whispers in the doorman's ear . \" which ones forgot their ID ?\"The doorman motions to my two friends and he proceeds to explain this is  a law and he has to follow it .I ask him why no one else in our party was asked . No real explanation was given . He says there are metro police in the back and I could talk to them to get the OK . I was more than willing to talk to them . I press him for the OK to talk with \"metro\"he ignores my questions ,and eventually storms off in a little fit   .Not sure why they seem to pick and choose who they let in as it was quite empty .I had heard that Zappos rents all the rooms and it is just locals who hang out their . . We were really looking forward to having a few drinks here ,but after this treatment  I will never return  .  For a better better choice Check out the Golden Nugget for nice poolside lounge seating and lots free of live music at the front bar ."}
{"text":"This is the perfect, downtown hang out spot with a group of friends.   I have never eaten here, and I have not really had their drinks, but to me, Gold Spike is all about the atmosphere. The bean bags and beds and couches feel like a really comfortable party at someone's house. There is always music playing, and you have a wide variety of games to choose from, ranging from corn hole to pool to giant jenga.   Gold Spike has something for everyone, and it is in a great location downtown. You can make it your only stop of the night or one of many.  I have never been here when there was a cover, so you are really getting a great deal. It can get extremely busy, so you may have to wait for games and seating, but it's no where near as crazy as some of the other bars and clubs."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere With the remodel. Went to see a band on a Friday night very good music.. REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE service inside at the bar two girls that did not have a clue behind the bar.. Very rude and slow 20 minutes for a drink is absurd. Then when u ask nicely they give u an attitude like its not there problem"}
{"text":"Fun club!!  Great place to hang out and a really nice change of scenery.  Had such a blast listening to their DJ Presto One!"}
{"text":"This place Is so much fun! The night we went there was roller skating which was very different ! They also have a lot of games and activities !"}
{"text":"Located downtown across from the grand. Nice atmosphere inside & out. Was in the mood for some junk food. Had the loaded nachos & a quesadilla. Portions were pretty big & the prices were reasonable....only $16 for both. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've come here about 3 times had had different experiences depending on the night. (all good, just know what your looking for.   The team is modern, edgy and everything is oversized. They have a lot of the usual games you would play at a backyard bbq, or dive bar: darts, corn-hole, shuffle-board, beer pong. but everything is giant sized. for instance instead of red cups on a table, they use trashcans painted red+ a volleyball instead of a ping-pong ball. It's really fun and all free.   I ordered food, because I was drunk and hungry, but wasn't that impressed so I would stick with the beer and games.   on tuesday nights, you have people lounging on the giant beanbags studying with the free wifi. mellow music plays you can do whatever game you want.  Fridays, and saturdays its crammed full of people. They play club music inside, and have live bands out back in front of a silverbullet camper.  Definitely recommend this place if you don't want to spend a lot of money, but still want to have a good night"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! It is away from the hustle and bustle of the LV strip and it's a great place to hang out with friends. They have a full bar and prices are decent for Las Vegas. They have indoor games (giant connect four, darts, billiards, arcade games), outdoor games (giant beer pong, 8-way and normal beer pong, chess, bean bag toss) which are free except the arcade games, and lots of seating everywhere!! Such a unique place for it to be 24/7. Take ur buddies here!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the creepiness of the outside!! This place is so cute and fun! Downtown is really coming alive. Great for locals to enjoy a night out with out the craziness of the strip. Bar inside and out lots of openness for seating. Ever want to play shuffle board cruise ship style with out the rocking of the boat, play some giant four square with out having to let kids win or enjoy some giant beer pong well this is your place!! They even have cool outdoor seating and live bands. I only didn't give it a 5 because I haven't tried the food yet. So I guess will just have to keep going back until I remember to try it."}
{"text":"Vegas is an amazing place!  Yet, once in a while you need a little break from those darn money eating slot machines and blood sucking tables. Gold Spike is a chance to kick back and play some friendly games that doesn't involve losing your ass. Of course, there is a bar, but its all about the games. Normal games your used to playing... just giant versions. Giant Connect Four, Giant Beer Pong, Giant Jenga, and I'm sure there is a few more that we missed. Our group of 4 spent our time sucking down Vodka sodas and playing a round of Giant Corn Hole. Had a really good time except some annoying kid kept trying to interrupt our game. Fuck him. Also, there was a restaurant we didn't get to try. But judging by their hot sauce collection, I'm sure they are cooking up something good."}
{"text":"Such a cool hang out spot! Don't let the exterior deceive you - it definitely gives off a totally different vibe. Inside you will find a large indoor/outdoor space (also a bar and small restaurant) with a ton of games that will keep you busy for a casual night out.  Indoor: 2 pool tables, tables & couches to lounge around, giant darts, some arcade games, a large open area (I'm guessing for dancing on busy nights?), food, and a bar.  Outdoor: giant jenga, giant operation (this wasn't working when I dropped by), large cornhole, tetherball, four square, giant beer pong/trash pong, a stage, and seating.  I was here on a monday night. Gold Spike wasn't crowded but all the games were still occupied. I'm not sure how this place is on a busy night but I definitely recommend dropping by if you're in town looking for something to do with a group of friends, especially if it's a random weekday with not much going on!"}
{"text":"this place was pretty cool. Outside games were awesome. Heaters were a plus. Live music and great drinks. Inside was dead, outside is the place to be. Came on a Thursday night and had a great time. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is so much fun - a great place to relax or make it a hangout if you want it to be. There is so much space and plenty of games going on. Even on crowded nights that I've been there, it's not suffocating and you can still get in on the games. (Oversized cornhole, oversized beer pong, darts, foosball, oversized jenga, oversized connect 4 - the list goes on!) I feel like the atmosphere is great - I have been with groups of 6-8 people and you meet other people when you're playing the games. It's a friendly environment between strangers!  Also, the cafe is a good spot for some grub. Pretty evenly priced, which surprised me. Angelina was our server the other evening and she was very attentive, and accommodating. I had been to Gold Spike for drinks and hangouts before but the food pleasantly surprised me.  Just be safe when walking to your car! Security at Gold Spike is pretty attentive to the surrounding area, but I am always extra cautious downtown."}
{"text":"Drinks, a diner, games, and indoor and outdoor areas. In the winter they set up an ice skating rink! Awesome atmosphere, definitely one of the best spots in the new downtown."}
{"text":"An adult park. And it's a bar! What sorcery is this? One could not resist it's temptations; giant Jenga, beer pong,  Psychedelic hopscotch, Over sized Corn hole. Oh my!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super fun and has a chill/ laid-back atmosphere... My Lyft driver said this is where the locals go and you can tell..  I came here on a Friday, no cover for girls and $10 for guys.. also tip: sweats are not allowed!  This place is like Dave and Buster's but better!! Enlarged games of chess, shuffel board, Jenga, beer pong, corn hole, connect four and probably more. I like the open space and they have live music playing outside and hip hop music playing inside. Such a good place to hang out or celebrate with a group of friends. I wish we had something like this in Cali, sigh."}
{"text":"I stopped in after the \"Neon Museum\" tour On Mon, at around 2:00pm, so I didn't really get a chance to experience what it's like when it gets into full swing during the evenings, but it definitely seems like a popular local's club to say the least. This place used to be a \"guilty pleasure experience for tourist's visiting the Fremont area and supposedly, the casino was filled with locals who used to walk around with tin foil around their heads that were supposed to influence the slot machines! LOL!!  The casino is closed and has been replaced with a very nice lounge, with a very nice bar, open seating and I was told they serve pretty good bar food by one of the bartenders. I was also told they still rent rooms. The outside has a really cool courtyard area, that has these really neat, over exaggeratedly, large games such as a chess board, with two feet tall pieces and bean bag toss games that are about three times what you would buy at a game store. The yard also features lounge areas with grass carpeting on the benches and little fire pits to relax, drink and just hand out and talk. Most definitely a place to meet up and just hang on a weekend or after work!! Great job at reinventing the wheel with this place. We have nothing like this where I live!(NJ.)"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to have cool friends in the know and got invited to the soft opening last night. Very cool place!  The new management team adds yet another revitalizing kick to the downtown scene, and does so without a gaming device on the premises!  I had visited Gold Spike about 2 or 3 months ago, and chatted with friends about the potential.  Thinking more along the lines of a casino refresh, but I think this lends to an even better scene, attracting a fun crowd.  With the great little courtyard area in the back, highlighting a beautiful Air Stream camper setup, some artificial grass, blow up pools and lawn chairs, 2 corn hole games for entertainment (that's bean bag toss for those who just asked the question), 4x6 timber Jenga style blocks that entertain the players and all the spectators, and a live retro jazzy 3 peice band belting out some Sinatra stylings, how could you not have a good time?  Add cocktails and hors d'oeuvres for a perfect setup.  Inside, the whole casino floor has been converted to a plush modern lounge with a great bar, some high top tables, lounge sofas, oversized bean bags, pillows, a huge bed for relaxing with your friends, and lots to do.  Real darts in the back, with some foosball, pool tables, or a giant corn hole game to continue your legume tossing skills whilst getting an upper body workout.  I plan to head back on a Friday or Saturday night and see how the crowd is.  I imagine this falls right in line with the eclectic offerings of all the other fun downtown establishments."}
{"text":"Besidea the ugly retarded door girl it was a solid night.  The door girl was hella rude, if you don't have the looks at least have a somewhat okay personality... but they had a Cool set up outside with beer Pong with music"}
{"text":"There is not much to say that has not already been said.  Play some games, chill, and listen to some tunes...remember you can come here anytime because they are open 24/7.  We come here for work related hangouts but one time we ordered food from the grill at the tables next to the bar. One of us had a mushroom veggie wrap and another had a veggie burger. It was fresh but diner style food. Recently I heard they are remodeling the grill area and have a new chef. Not sure. I think the grill has another listing so you can check out more info there.  It can get super duper busy outside if they have a show and now that the skating rink outside won't be back again, the space can pack a ton of people in. They usually have portable bars setup out back for those who need it.  Go check it out...oh and don't forget to pet the golden snake for good luck :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this spot, it is wonderful. First up its adults only which is what i want when in Vegas. Oversized fun games inside and out, Connect Four, Jenga, chess, darts, pool tables and more. Big satiny beds to lounge on. Beautiful bar area helpful, friendly staff. The place is really well kept up and clean. The restaurant/grill is now one of our favorites, we ate there 2 days in a row service and food were perfect. The food was seriously gourmet, sooo good and well seasoned. I was really surprised but in a wonderful way. We were told that Thur, Fri and Sat nights there's a live dj & a charge to come party and its well worth it, maybe we'll try that out on the next visit. Its good to have some nice options downtown."}
{"text":"3 stars for the douche bartenders. 5 stars for the overall experience. 3 stars for the restaurant.  1 star for one bathroom for men and women That have about 3-4 stalls  If theres no one at the bar and im effin sitting there with my wallet out to show im ready to get shit faced then wtf  The service girls are friendly and gave free shots foam fingers and wingman tshirts  The restaurant is aite but the servers were very friendly  The ambience is age group friendly. I saw people from 21-60 having a fun time playing childhood games.  Theres plenty of seating inside including big porn beds for everyone to lay on to snog.  Theres also an awesome outdoor scene complete with adult size jenga too bad theres only one, a live band thatll play after 10, an ice skating rink and a seating area with built in fireplaces.   Its an overall awesome place to bring your quirky coworkers if youre not into bowling. Hehe"}
{"text":"Where else can you find an adult playground in Vegas? I've been here on weeknights only so I'm not sure how weekends are (I'm assuming extremely crowded) but I enjoyed coming here the past two Monday nights. Ambiance is very chill and relaxed as opposed to a fast-paced, obnoxious crowd on the strip. I liked that it was away from the loud music on Fremont street.  There are bean bags, comfy beds, chairs to lounge in. A bar with attentive bartenders. Play pool, foursquare, jenga, giant beer pong, etc. It was a nice getaway from the chaos on the strip & Fremont street, for sure.  I don't recommend parking at their vicinity though. Just find a hotel, get it validated or simply pay half of what you'd pay for the Gold Spike parking, which is $10. Say wuuuuut. No thanks.  Overall, it's a nice place to relax, drink, play games & hang out with good company."}
{"text":"Shout out to Goldspike and my favorite bouncer Kashif had a blast thanks again brutha"}
{"text":"My buddy got kicked out because he asked for giant beer pong balls and the NEW bartender assumed it was for beer pong and he got kicked out by security, even after telling them he would pay for the beer pong he didn't order. What a joke of security/bar management."}
{"text":"Fun place to drink. So many things to do and they're tech friendly"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. Been here for Super Bowl had a blast. Whenever we are in town we have to stop by. The oversized cornhole was a good time. Fit in a game of tetherball made my trip."}
{"text":"They definitely could use more games, but thanks for making my birthday celebrations awesome. Despite a few bartender who should probably learn how to make a simple vodka red bull, the service is as quick as they can be & usually polite!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I actually came here two nights in a row! Fun games, great chill vibe, good food & drinks! I come here every time I'm in Vegas & just want to do something off the strip."}
{"text":"THE WORST EXPERIENCE AND TREATMENT FROM SECURITY!!!If I could give the experience zero stars I would. It was not busy on a Tuesday night which is why I don't understand the bad service and the terrible attitude and demeanor from the security staff. When we asked for a refund the security who was the one checking purses at the door got extremely aggressive and refused letting us get our refund for items we didn't consume. When we asked for management this security said he was the manager and proceeded to call in backup to escort our whole group out without allowing refunds. Living in Las Vegas we are a customer service based city. This had been the worst treatment I have ever received in my life. If someone is being civilized with you I don't understand why be so rude. Management please train your staff so they know how to properly treat costumers. Management and Security staff are the ones driving business away their treatment of paying patrons is absolutely awful.I really hope something is done to correct this otherwise they will continue to drive business away!"}
{"text":"Case of the mondaze definitely a local gem! Take a step into the movie imagination of BIG and enjoy the local humor. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place in theory- Giant Jenga and Connect 4, cornhole, ping pong, chalkboards, foosball, and other assorted games indoors and outdoors. The back patio area was especially nice, the bed in the lobby was bizarre.  Service was not attentive- there was a mix up about an event, but we spent significant time in the bar without being acknowledged, and service at the Grill restaurant on site was painfully slow (40 minutes for breakfast).  Meals were hit or miss- I enjoyed the breakfast burrito with bacon (though it did not have the cheese I ordered), and really liked the salsa it came with, but Cassandra's pancakes were pretty bad.  I did not drink, so I cannot speak to their alcohol.  Cool place to have fun with friends but not a place I'm rushing to return to."}
{"text":"I had a great night at this place until I tried to leave.  When I tried leaving a security guard which should have been my first sign that something was up with this place said I could not leave.  I said your crazy I am leaving and as I made my way through the door the security guard proceeded to push me back into the bar knocking people over.  He continued to push me into the dance floor area which was very crowded and we began knocking more people over and more security guards gave notice to this and they also joined in on pushing into a crowd.  After four or five security guards are pushing me into the crowd we were then knocking people over like a bowling ball to bowling pins until I fell backwards on top of dancers.  After this dog pile began to split up, I was then picked up by the guards and dragged out of the building like I had originally intended to do (WTF!!).  So they continued to drag me out to a police car, (SUPRISE!! Security guards and police waiting outside, this is obviously not a place me but more of a place for thugs, dealers and people who probably live in the less savory, lower income parts of town).  So now I'm on the hood of a police car wondering WTF is going on and the police were just doing their jobs by detaining me and figuring out what the details of the situation were.  Another older security showed up weighing about 100lbs soaking wet explaining something to the cops (I don't know what exactly) and when the officers (D.KANO and ESPERANZA) asked for my side of the story I told them when I tried leaving that I was told I could not (false imprisonment) and when I continued to try to leave I was then assaulted by four or five of the security guards.  The officers explained to me that they could not do anything about the assault or alleged false imprisonment because Gold Spike is a business.  When I asked that if I were to imprison and assault someone in my own home, the officer (D.KANO) had no answer nor would he do anything about the assault.  What I'm really mad at here is the security protocols that this establishment has and their bad protocols are only enhanced by the Las Vegas Metro Police Department.  Together they are a formula for disaster and I would not doubt this I am the first or last instance of this happening.  I would like to thank the other police officer for turning off his strobes after my wife explained that I have PTSD and a brain injury but thumbs down to the establishment, its security and the two officers who failed to do anything about an assault."}
{"text":"Beer, good. Games, great. Doorman, dicks. If you come here make sure you stop in before 9 pm because they are strict on the cover charge."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that I have yet to write a review for Gold Spike seeing that I frequent the place so much!  Gold Spike is that DTLV watering hole gem for me. They don't have any insane crazy cocktails... or any specialty cocktails, really. But they have that Cheers atmosphere with a huge twist.  Like others have mentioned, Gold Spike is an adult playground. Not so much with swing sets but life size Jenga, Pool, Beer Pong, Connect Four... etc. Some childhood favorites (and college favorites) in adult size! I always bring my out of town guests here to play and they always have a good time.   The drink prices are reasonable... there is a mid-afternoon/early evening happy hour to be had. I cannot recall the exact times but after 3pm for sure. Even if you don't make happy hour, the drink prices will not break your bank.   Gold Spike is a nice getaway from gaming in the downtown area... that's right; no slots or video poker. Try playing darts or shooting pool instead. If you don't feel like doing anything, there is plenty of seating and a HUGE bed for ample resting between bar hops.  Oh! Do not miss out on the food! There is a diner within the bar/establishment and the breakfast deals are great! The breakfast itself is pretty delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bar for anyone that wants to have a good time. It has to honestly be one of the best bars I have ever been too specially in this part of Vegas. Everyone else mentioned what there is to do here so I won't go into that but trust me this place is great. Prices are also extremely good to give you an example a draft blue moon and cranberry vodka was 14 dollars and they both tastes great. Bartenders were really cool as well as the bouncer/security. There were two people constantly cleaning the place around from chairs to tables to bathrooms. I really appreciate it when a place is clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Had a blast with the siblings and cousins visiting from Hawaii and California.  We went on a Thursday night, so I can only imagine that it wasn't as crowded as it could be. We got the chance to play Ping Pong (outside) and Darts (inside by main bar). You get all the game supplies at the main bar, and as collateral, they hold your ID. Ahahaha... My cousin honestly lost one Ping Pong ball under the fence, but I guess that wasn't a problem...? Maybe it just happens so often that it doesn't phase the business? Wish we could've played the big version of Beer Pong and Cornhole. Apparently, those get hogged a lot. All the bartenders were nice and accommodating, which I know can be a pain in the butt to do when dealing with a large group. Drinks were good so long as you knew what type of mixed drinks you liked and alcohol brands.  I liked the live band that played outside, and didn't mind the DJ and music selection inside either. Both provided good vibes for us to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zappos party HQ. They've got a great bar, tons of life size games (connect 4, corn hole etc.) and late night food. Awesome place to stop by when you're Downtown LV."}
{"text":"Drinks are overpriced and pretty weak. The music selection is incredibly white-college-kid-trying-to-be-gangsta. The crowd is, well, once again, white-college-kid-trying-to-be-gangsta. It's one of those joints where everybody tries to act thug life, and yet nobody is at all intimidating. That might be because I'm old school OG -- or whatever kids call it these days.   The atmosphere is \"fun\", but the novelty of the games wears off quickly. You end up standing around, watching awkward kids pretend they're in a club, and wondering when the drunk idiots at the foosball table will be done. Worth it if you don't feel like trying at all, but... eh..."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place just a little over 4 years now. I love it. From the casual feel to the life size games you just can't go wrong here. My favorite is life size Jenga. The music is always a good mix as well. The bouncers are friendly and so are the bartenders. The feel here is like an adult playground. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"The old Gold Spike is actually where my wife and I got married. This place goes back like four flats on a Cadillac becoming a staple of downtown. After being bought out by Zappo's and completely redoing the main floor; what a change of pace. And an establishment without gaming machines? Not the norm when it comes to Vegas but definitely a nice little change.   They now have TONS of games for your entertaining pleasure from oversized Corn-Hole to oversized Jenga, Connect Four and Beer Pong. There's darts, shuffle board, board games and even a trippy blacklight room with tons of designs and stuff. The drink prices don't break the bank and the eats are half decent. Don't go there looking for a steak or lobster but if you're in the mood for wings or a burger to help soak up the alcohol they will get the job done. I think the key here is that here you have the ability to just play some games and have fun hanging out with your buds.   The outdoor patio area is a great place to meet up w/ your friends and unwind. There's PLENTY of seating to go around. They also have mobile heaters for when it's colder out and sometimes they have a bar outside in the patio area too.  Smoking is reserved for the outdoor patio area only but is nothing we're upset with being we're ex-smokers lol All in all we ALWAYS have a blast when we stop in at the Gold Spike!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food. The sliders are incredible. I've probably had them 20 times and I live in England."}
{"text":"I've seen this concept of children's games for adults or oversized games before, but Gold Spike hits the nail with execution. There are so many books and crannies that you're bound to find a game for you and friends from a couple to a group of 8. I recommend going early if there are men in your group so as to get your wrist stamped before the crowd comes in. I played twister and foursquare in heels and the atmosphere of drunk people just wanting to play games was great. No one was creepy and everyone was dressed pretty casually although some were dressed to impress with the nightclub getting started inside. No judgement here! The only thing I can complain about (reasonably) was the long and sometimes confusing lines to get drinks. There are a couple of bars and they're both packed if you want your fill. Five stars, gold strike. Well done."}
{"text":"Me and my friends always have a great time here! Ski, one of the guys that works there, is always taking care of us and is such a sweetheart! There is so much to do at Goldspike, you won't be bored :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was Eden to locals when it first opened. Nowadays it's super bro-like and bathrooms are filthy. Service is below average but the premises themselves are \"okay\".   The games certainly make up for the lack of quality but I do wish the place was as awesome as it was when it first opened."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a great place to chill, play some life-size social games, grab a drink and even eat.  It's 24/7 great place for a chill date or hanging with friends.  Life size beer pong, corn hole and shuffleboard to name a few. If you are in downtown come here."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here!  Such a cool, spacious, hip place! Oversized board games (like Connect Four, Jenga, etc), Trash Pong (aka oversized beer pong!), and an ice rink! I like how you can hang out indoor or outdoor!     Great music and our bartender was quick and attentive to our every need!  Wouldn't mind coming here again if we're hanging out downtown!"}
{"text":"The Gold Spike used to be the usual hang out spot for my friends and me. But recently they've raised their prices, starting charging cover on the weekends, and no longer include tax in the price of alcohol. I wouldn't really mind just raising the prices, but both raising the prices and not including tax effectively makes a previously $3 beer now a $4.48 beer. That's a 50% increase.  This price increase doesn't only affect the customer; it also affects the bartenders. I've spoken to a few of the bartenders and they have noticed a sizable drop in their take-home pay from tips. Not only that, but the Gold Spike management requires the bartenders' cash drawers be within a certain \"margin of error\", which means bartenders cannot round up or down on the added tax to drinks. This means the bartenders have to spend more time at the drawer counting out change, effectively causing less drinks served per hour which in turn results in even less tips.  That being said, despite their terrible policies and practices, the Gold Spike has amenities which make the experience enjoyable. Pool, darts, foosball, Golden Tee, and a gigantic backyard make the Gold Spike an iconic downtown hangout spot. Avoid the weekends though or you'll be with a very rough crowd, where fights are the norm."}
{"text":"Worst place ever long ass line and then the bouncer brings up two girls to cut the line Nd as we walk with them and ask could we go in with them he said \"no I don't know y'all\" I'm like are you fkn kidding me ? Not worth it honestly shitty place with shitty music only dick swingers hang at this joint and if I can rate this at zero stars I would"}
{"text":"Been here twice, but both times it was really fun.  Great place to go with a group.  Back area has a slew of fun activities like giant Jenga,  giant cornhole (and small cornhole), giant chess, giant beer pong, 4 square, and more.  Crowds are usually pretty chill; everyone just seems to have fun playing the different games and having some drinks.  Inside the bar feels like a cool nightclub, only with giant Connect 4 and some arcade games.  Great local spot on Fremont."}
{"text":"Was having fun with my friends until I dropped my $20 bill and a female employee quickly ran up and took it right in front of me..  kinda like when  kids break a piñata and run to get the candy.. to me that was a shady thing to do how do you wanna have loyal customers or any business when the employees steal right under the customers nose makes you wonder if they steal from the company too"}
{"text":"There's a lot of cool new stuff happening downtown and Gold Spike is one of the main events. It's a giant playground that I think would strike a note of nostalgia to children of the 80's and 90's. They have regular-sized 4 Square (seriously, when was the last time I played that?) and ping pong. Every other game on the lot is giant: Connect 4, Jenga, Beer Pong. You can stay inside for the party vibe and strike some moves on the dance floor or venture outside for a more relaxed vibe and where most of the games are located. Everyone was super chill and friendly. Plus, there was no charge to get in: don't know if that's normal or if we came on a special night. Overall, this place is, as my peers would probably say, dope! Check it out."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Gold Spike for my son's 21st birthday.  We headed over around 11am on Sunday to watch some football.  The place was empty...seriously we were the only peeps there!  Don't get me wrong, it worked out perfectly for us.  We had one on one attention from the bartender (who was super sweet and awesome), we got to watch the football game that we wanted to, and we had the back yard all to ourselves!    I LOVED the back yard.  Lots of fun games to keep you entertained.  I hadn't played tether ball in years!  I also played beer pong for the first time.  Not sure I like it, but I didn't do so bad - LOL!  All of the games were spaced out well, so you didn't feel like you were right on top of each other and the decor was funky and cool.  The cost for drinks was awesome, especially since we are some heavy hitters lol!  We all had a great time and would definitely come back!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ever since the remodel/takeover this place has been increasing in popularity. It has become a spot for quite the variety of people to hang out in Downtown Las Vegas. Generally theres a line on weekends but nobody seems to mind, because the place is always busy. Also, once you get to the door you are greeted by female cashier Andy who always seems to have a great smile. Once in there is a club like vibe in the indoor space with music, dance floor and two bars. Along with their 24 hour cafe. The outside is like a huge play area for adults. With games like large sized Jenga. Theres also an outdoor bar, which is usually where I get drinks from Sean or Josh. They're always fun and make good drinks. This place is also good during the week where you won't find it as busy but fun none the less."}
{"text":"I like this place,  but the bathrooms are disgusting. There is never toilet paper, they were out of soap last time and  they had no paper towels to dry hands. Other than that, the little cafe is pretty decent and the drinks are cheap.  Good times can be had."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome and very unique. Like they have so many activities and games to play to really keep your night fun. And it's way bigger once you go inside. There's a dance floor, a bar, and even a creepy bed next to the dance floor (why is that even there) Then you walk outside and see a live size game of beer pong, cornhole, four square, and other games that remind you of the good days during recess. The music is cool, it varies per night. But there's always a good crowd and a good vibe."}
{"text":"Update: 2/26/18 Proper darts are back at The Gold Spike!   Very happy they've changed their minds. Great little restaurant there now.  Great staff"}
{"text":"Wow what a fun place to play and let your inner child out with giant Jengo, ice skating, and much more.  Even the grill had good food.  The kale salad is the best I have ever had, the jambalaya had a nice kick and they have good Belgian beer for my beer snob BF."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Gold spike! Great live music and great vibes! The bar has a wide variety of drinks, Got the chance to play outdoor beer pong with the party I came with. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"My favorite place to work during the week when I want to get out of the office. They have plenty of spots to plug in and free wifi. The background music can be challenging if you have conference calls, but that's a mild inconvenience.   In the evening it turns into a great place to watch a football/basketball game, meet friends for a drink or just hang out.   This is an awesome addition to Las Vegas and the downtown vibe."}
{"text":"I recently attended the Life is Beautiful Grills and Guitars event here.  I work downtown and often walk by the Gold Spike.  I had know idea what a neat place it is.  I thought it was a casino in the inside but it is not.  The area has the vibe of super community centers with all types of cool stuff to do.  The event was in the back area which is really neat.  It was setup up for the Grills and Guitars event but I've seen big chess sets back there and other games.  The Gold Spike has a very fun vibe to it.  The people in the bar area seemed very relaxed and were enjoying themselves.  The Grills and Guitars Life is Beautiful event was fantastic.  All of the chefs were very friendly and interacted with everyone.  Of course the food was also out of this world and very good."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday celebrations. Bunch of yelpers together for a farewell dinner for a friend. It's an interesting place, it's the kitchen sink of downtown Las Vegas. There is a restaurant, a bar, a lounge, and a game room. Perfect place to get drunk and do weird stuff. The drink are similar to any other location and the food is average junk food. The lounge area is very disorganized chaos (at least on the Friday/Saturday nights). I'd say stop by to take a look at it but there are many better places in that neighborhood that you'll have more fun in."}
{"text":"The games here are awesome!! I wish they had a better system for getting in line for a game. Your best bet is to get there before 10pm of you want to play and post up at a game and don't leave for the rest of the night. My favorite is the jumbo corn hole. They also have jumbo jenga and trash can sized beer pong. Good dancing music but not many people actually start dancing until at least midnight.  There are several bars inside and outside as well as waitresses so the service is quick and you don't have to waste time  waiting to get drinks. Drink prices are not great like $7ish for a well drink that wasn't that strong."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Gold Spike??!? Cause honestly, I can't think of anything. Whenever I think about DTLV, Gold Spike is the first place that comes to mind. I've definitely spent a substantial amount of time here. And believe me, once you go, you'll be hooked.   First off, there's no cover...ever! And I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get in. This place has the perfect ratio of fun, games, alcohol and shenanigans. It's pretty impossible to be bored here. Giant beer pong & chess, CORN HOLE my personal favorite, darts, billiards, shuffle boards, four square (popular with the boys). Lounge on the comfy bed near the entrance or the ginormous bean bags while you hang out with friends. Or take a step outside to catch a breath of fresh air and perhaps a game of oversized jenga. Be forewarned, I am a jenga master, lol! Play me at your own risk :P  Overall I just love the vibe here. You can show up in a pair of jeans tank top and sandals and fit right in. Drinks are reasonably priced and the food was pretty decent. Burgers, sandwiches, wings. Typical but tasty bar food. It's a great place to take out-of-towners or just a cool spot to #meetup with friends.   Helpful tip: Valet at The Downtown Grand, it's free and adjacent to Gold Spike. Very convenient."}
{"text":"it's a bar and restaurant that has over size games and board games you can play.  I've been several times and have had many good times.   The food is delicious and really good priced for what you get.  However I have received horrible service almost every time except for when I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen.    During the day it is comfortable and a little low key, but at night it gets crowded.  Which isn't a bad thing, but defiantly game changer.    The drink prices are pretty high, but it keeps rift raft out so I'm ok with paying a couple extra dollars to be in a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"How can I give this place 0 stars and put it all over their entire social media network? I appreciate Chris the manager for trying to help the situation, but this place is seriously the worst. Terrible music, terrible security. Either they are new or they are just the worst piece of human beings ever. After having my husband wait for me in the hallway of the women's bathroom, we were asked to leave because he was \"in the way of a hallway\" according to one of their mployees. Then had another security guard get in my husbands face to let him know he \"shouldn't be just waiting in line\" even though he's clearly waiting for a woman to get out of a bathroom. Then that security guard was offended because my husband said that he wasn't trying to be disrespectful for waiting in line for me. Tried to kick us out of your okay establishment is uncalled for. Your club and establishment is the reason I would rather stay home and get drunk than go out to a place like this."}
{"text":"My wallet got stolen here and Dustin Shangreaux the security there was really helpful and proactive. I was pissed about my wallet got stolen, but im really satisfied about the service from him."}
{"text":"Pretty young crowd. Drinks are good but service tends to be slow. Don't plan on getting in and out of here quickly."}
{"text":"i would say this place is awesome. games after games and the party dont stop"}
{"text":"Good morning!! I was in Las Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party and some of the girls were staying at the Oasis hotel while others of us were staying at different hotels.  Having been to Goldspike before during the day, I was surprised how it transforms into a different atmosphere at night! What impressed me more was the security!! We went to enter from the side door, seeing some of the girls had a room, and we were greeted by a very pleasant lady who verified my friends were guests and asked if we were going to their room, which we were at that time. At first we thought that was weird but she explained that she was calling over a security guy to escort us to the elevator.  We asked if they had any problems and she said NO that they just don't want any either! We thought that was great considering what had just happened in Texas! Both the lady at the door and the guy who escorted us to the elevator were extremely pleasant and helpful!! The drinks were awesome!! The DJ was ok! Again, Goldspike exceeded my expectations!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas my whole life and Gold Spike is the best place in Las Vegas to have a great time. The staff is fantastic and the women are beautiful. If you ever want to go out and experience Vegas go to Gold Spike. I love it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have given this place more than a couples tries...EVERY TIME we have been in the bartender service had been THE worst in the ENTIRE city. They are all slow. They ignore you. They aren't particularly friendly.  We are locals, we go out a lot downtown, we are great patrons. But this place has disappointed us on service EVERY TIME!  I only give it a second star because of the originality on the back patio and size of the lounge.  The service is SO BAD that I gave to mention it one more time. We finally will not be back again and will give the other bars downtown our money."}
{"text":"I'm definitely one of those girls that loves a good local spot to go to and unwind. Gold Spike is a good mix of the local crowd and small tourist feel of Vegas, but I would say definitely more of the local crowd. This is definitely one of my favorite DTLV spots to go to. Large and wide spacing, full bar, and has lots of \"games\" that I'm sure are even more fun to play when you're drunk   Gold Spike located right in the heart of DTLV off Las Vegas Blvd and Odgen (walking distance from the Ogden Condos. They have an awesome backyard outdoors area aside from the bar inside... they have live bands play on the weekends, and they're famous or well known for their \"life size\" or jumbo beer pong, jenga, and bean bag toss.   Both the inside and outside are well kept and clean... definitely has a hipster type feel to the place. They even pool  tables as well inside the bar, and on the kinky side, they have beds inside :)  Lots of couches and sitting areas, and inside of Gold Spike they also have a 24/hr cafe. Now I've been to Gold Spike during the day time (around 3pm) for a business meeting and have eaten there from the Cafe. I actually ordered from inside Gold Spike lounge area (not near the bar) and I had kids with me... I was surprised I was allowed to have the kids. And I ordered the Portobello Mushroom and caramelized onion sandwich and the girls I was babysitting had chocolate pancakes. The servers brought the food out to us in the lounge and we didn't have to eat inside the cafe which I thought was awesome service!   My sandwich was delicious and full of flavor, drizzled with a dark truffle sauce that sealed the caramelized onion and mushroom taste together. And the fries already came with ranch on the side which was pretty awesome I didn't have to ask for sauce. and the fries we cooked just right, not too hard and not too soggy. The chocolate pancakes are also delicious and just the right amount of sweet.   We received great service all the way from the people serving us food, to the lady cleaning the fire pits in the backyard, to the security guard in the front upon entering Gold Spike... I had a great time coming here at night with friends for a few drunks and an even better time coming here during the day for a business meeting and was able to bring kids and still enjoy the place. Gold Spike is an awesome side to Vegas that if you wanna still party like it's 1999 but are tired of paying Marquee prices... Gold Spike is the place to be! Definitely a Local's Diamond in the  Ruff."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. We stayed at the hotel and had most of our meals at the gold spike. My favorite waitress is Angelina. She is so friendly and attentive. The food was cooked perfect every time. The back yard is a grate place for adults in body but kids at heart. It was a little loud but that is to be expected at a bar. Love it."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun! I have some of my favorite memories here! The playground where every stranger is your friend! Hehe! Love that they have human sized board games, live music/entertainment, a dance floor, so many different bars, pool tables and everything just wraps together to create a wonderful atmosphere! Try this place on a first Friday ;)"}
{"text":"Went to spend the evening with my daughter and her friends for her birthday- the place looks great,  a lot of fun, oversized games like Jenga and Cornwall.  The outdoor area is set up very nicely with lots of seating available. the food was good, nothing unique but good bar food. My only complaint is the service or should I say, the lack of service. Despite the fact that we had a group of twenty people, we could not get anyone to serve us outside.  We would have ordered more food and drinks but when you wait 45 minutes for a beer it's just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place iits great you should xo e here bexause its awesome. Shpet revoews are npt great so frab a drink and see you hrre."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Gold Spike and I had a great time with a few friends. The line was short and we got in really quickly (major plus, because it was FREEZING outside). They don't charge a cover to enter either, which is nice. The inside looks like your standard Las Vegas downtown bar, but outside is where all the games are. They have 4 square, Giant Beer Pong, and Giant chess and checkers. Overall a fun atmosphere. Only drawbacks are that there need to be more restrooms (one of our friends became ill and there was a huge line for the restroom), and they need to add some outdoor heaters to make guests playing games more comfortable."}
{"text":"yasssss! I Love gold spike. They have life size Jenga, beer pong, pool tables, etc. The bartender was the sweetest! I will definately be back the next time i am in vegas!"}
{"text":"This aint the gold spike of yesteryear. It used to be an old dingy casino/hotel but then Zappos brought it and its now a trendy lounge with great vibes, a huge outdoor area with oversized games, and cheap drink prices. They have bands performing sometimes in the evening and a DJ most nights. One of our favorite places to hang out downtown."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to stay here for a company trip and I would certainly come back on my own dime. Great accommodations, the rooms are clean and artfully decorated. Minimalist influence and mid century modern flair. The staff at the bar and The Grill are amazing and cheerful. I had breakfast at The Grill and could not have had a better start to my morning. Angelina, my waitress, was kind, sweet and very thoughtful. She ensured my order was hot and exactly as I asked. The was extremely helpful and ensured my coffee was hot and fresh. I never had to ask for a thing, she anticipated every request. Captain Burrell, the sous chef, was loud, fun and cheerful. I enjoyed speaking with him and he ensured the cook had my order ON POINT! The staff at The Grill was definitely the highlight of the trip and seal the Gold Spike as my favorite downtown Las Vegas hotel."}
{"text":"Cool spot. \"Off the grid\" Bring friends. Cheap drinks. Cool games - jenga, connect four, shuffle board. Not that bullshit Vegas strip scene. They have a \"First Friday\" crowd every first of the month"}
{"text":"Can you kill the overpowering grandma smell? I 'll stay for the party and great deals but YUCK!! I can't breathe."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and it's awesome!  Giant Jenga, Connect 4, Beer Pong, 8 player Beer Pong, Skeeball --- this place is awesome and an easy way to spend several hours hanging out with friends.  Wish there was a place like this where we live!"}
{"text":"I visited Gold Spike 7/29/16. I liked the idea of this establishment at first..  As my friends hit the bar I began to make my way towards the rest room & came across a short, slim framed blonde woman. She too singled me out; as Damon B mentioned in his review; gave me no explanation as to why I was being kicked out. I did not make a big fuss at that moment because the DJ was playing awful music anyway, so I was fine with leaving.   The only reason I am writing this review is because I thoroughly believe I was escorted out due to RACISM. The white anglo saxon woman was clearly on some sort of PREJUDICE power trip & wanted to humiliate & belittle me for my skin tone. I am appalled & disgusted by that particular employees actions, and with the Gold Spike for hiring someone like that in 2016.   I will never be a patron of Gold Spike again & I will certainly inform everyone I know; including my large social media follower base; about the RACIAL PREJUDICE of the employees here.   The ambiance at Gold Spike is less Downtown Las Vegas & more 1950's Mississippi, hit the Brass Lounge or Beauty Bar instead for better music & less backwards social norms."}
{"text":"Looking for a break from Fremont Street, found this place and was stopped by the door man and asked for my room key.  Told him I was not staying there.  Then he asked for my ID.  I am 40 years old and there is no question that I am legal age.  Then he didn't want to let us in because my girlfriend had a bottle of diet 7-UP. Then he wanted to take my picture to be let in.  Sorry, but there is enough competition in downtown Las Vegas that I should not and will not jump through hoops to be allowed to walk into a business to spend my money. At that point I just said \"you know what, I'm good\" and went to a business that was more welcoming of me and my money.  Never let a business treat you like it is a privilege to spend your money there."}
{"text":"What a neat place this was! It's a adult playground were you can act like a child but drink like a adult. What a great concept! If you like something different where you can play 4 square at 1 am with complete strangers and drink then this is your kind of place!"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is definitely one of the best bars here in Las Vegas. It's legitimately a playground for adults with games and things to do throughout the whole place! Just grab a drink and either stay inside or outside! Both have so much for you to do, they give you no excuse to be bored. Plus the music is always crackin too. Whenever my friends wanna hit downtown Gold Spike is definitely always either the first bar we hit, or the bar we finish the night at. So much fun, and you don't have to be jammed up in a tiny space like many of the other bars, this place is HUGE!!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty nice room. Ive stayed at the bridger and the motel six and the tod hostel....this place was okay...i might have liked the tod hostel better weird huh."}
{"text":"Every time I try to go on the weekends the front door men are ghetto and rude and I always even up leaving I would stay away there staff are to ghetto"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. And when it's not a weekend night, it's a fun place to be. On non-weekend nights, it's not too crowded and not too loud. The cocktails pretty much suck. The beer offerings are kinda meh. But you don't come here for the drinks. You come here to play. I particularly like the outdoor area with the giant chess and beer pong areas. It's like a big playground for adults with alcohol. There's no gambling, so it's a nice reprieve from the constant dinging of the slot machines. All in all, I'll consider myself a fan (on non-weekend nights)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill place to just have fun and enjoy your beverage... This is the place. Today's weather is so perfect for some adult size jenga, corn hole, table tennis, pong. Cool place to hang out and socialize with friends or make some new ones. Check this place out next time your in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a MESS.   So, the concept is great; games everywhere, cool vibe, outdoor area, etc. Where it fails absolutely is that it turned into a very young 21-ish hipster dump with people screaming like girls, lots of drunken antics (guys throwing other guys over their shoulders, a little sickness on the side) and a staff that has no idea how to control this unwieldy beast.  Let me address first the bar situation. Sadly understaffed. Will, the unkempt bartender whose ass crack I saw more than I cared to, was rude, inefficient, dirty looking (I mean, scuzzy) and completely biased toward those he served. If they don't fire this guy then he's obviously in with the bosses. Loser.  A girl with a tramp stamp (you can't miss it, it takes up her whole back) behind the bar with her face in the computer for a good solid 20 minutes (that's how long it took us to get a drink and I STILL don't know what she looks like) ignoring everyone at the bar, that she works at, for a living, to do nothing. Perfect.   Well, that's about it for bartenders on a loud, busy Thursday night. A bar back that we'd asked to help us get oblivious tramp stamp girl's attention snapped at us like we were filthy animals who'd wandered in for a scrap. Maybe a little customer service training is in order. I THINK SO.  On our way outside to the back through the blasting music that was so loud that if you could hear yourself think you would tell yourself to leave, saw a guy passed clean out. A sonic boom couldn't wake this guy. Because that's how loud the music was and he was snoring heavily.   Finally make it out to see a bunch of seriously young looking kids screaming about Jenga. The fabulous band (with a bass player!) couldn't be heard over the juvenile squeals and blocks crashing of this game that seems fun, but not when you have cool music to listen to. Priorities are not right here.   We had one great bartender who came over and got us our second drink. She was sweet and very cool. I tried to hand her a tip, but she had walked away (??). I had to call her back. Pretty sure she's not used to that with this entitled whiny crowd. Ugh. I'd die if I had her job. Or, I'd probably go to jail for back handing some of those kids. Where were their parents??  Anyway, avoid until this situation fixes itself, it has so much potential. As of now it's just a joke.  As an aside I'd say to the manangers: if you want to make money it's not by alienating people who have disposable income to spend and allowing the college level brats who make minimum wage to take over. I'm pretty sure they're costing you as much as you're making, both in keeping the older crowd away and with the serious destruction they looked like they were causing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Wish I had one of them back home, it's literally an adult playground with so many games drinking as well as non drinking games.  There are so many bars in here as well as awesome music.  They have a food bar if you have any munchies.  This place is a one stop shop for a night of clean adult fun.    Our server suggested that we check this place out as well as Freemont street and I am so glad she recommended it.  Both places where awesome!  There is no cover charge to get in and most of the games are free to play. Darts you need to hand your ID to the bar tender to get darts and pool you have to pay $10 for an hour of ply as well as put your name on the list.  So bummed that there isn't a place like this back home, I would come there all the time"}
{"text":"Stepped in because we heard this was the \"adult playground\" for downtown Vegas. My husband went to the bar ($8 for a well tequila and tonic). Where the bartender began to complain about how it was just first Friday so it was \"filled with black people who don't tip\". Guess he didnt realize I (an African American woman) was with him. We walked right out. Would give zero if i could"}
{"text":"Pretty laid back lounge and staff. The furniture arrangement is interesting here. Places to sit down all over but yet enough room to dance, if you wanted to. There's a nice outdoor area in the back. I don't know if they have it every night, but when I went, there was a nice band playing some great reggae grooves. Plus it won't hurt your wallet. Worth a look if you're looking for something off the strip."}
{"text":"A group of us went here my first night in Vegas.  It was a great time and I wish we had something like this where I live.  It's chock full of all kinds of over-sized games.  Inside, there's giant cornhole with what seems like 5 lb beanbags (the first time you throw, you will most certainly come up short, way short), shuffleboard, pool, hop scotch, darts and connect four.  There's also a huge bed and a bunch of giant beanbags for relaxing.  Outside is super chill.  It has sort of an upscale backyard feel to it.  They have a bunch of outdoor seating with live music and even more games which included Jenga, more cornhole and beer pong.  Loved it out there!  The only negative I could come up with is that this place is big, a little too big in my opinion.  Seeing other reviews, I can see why now since it used to be a casino.  I feel like the night I went it had a pretty good amount of people there but since there's just so much space to cover it almost felt kind of empty.  I feel like this environment would benefit in a more intimate space but that's just me.  We still had the best time and I only wish they would've fixed the photo booth for us.  We really wanted to leave with a group shot of all 7 of us crammed in there."}
{"text":"We had our christmas party here-good food/ good service/ great drinks fun place to be.  Parking was challenge for some but I will return for drinks and pool."}
{"text":"Hi Gold Spike. Your establishment seems to put a bad taste in my mouth every time I set foot in it.  Get your staff in check. I've eaten at your diner many times since you've reopened. Never to be acknowledged in order to be seated- then wind up seating myself and my friends at the bar inside the diner after a solid amount of waiting time and attempting eye contact with a server. Then STILL get no menu. It's like everyone who works here is overwhelmed- and that's YOUR fault not your employees. Especially **** over at the bar. He's in a very bad mood and not really trying hard to hide it.   You suck. I seriously hate the gold spike ever since you guys took over. Major Bummer. Heard you pay the bands well though. Too bad I don't even want to watch my friends play when you book them because it's such a college frat underemployed hipster nightmare!  Every time All the time!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a really fun place!! I think that it is awesome that something like this is in Las Vegas. Instead of a casino, this has been completely re-done into a fun lounge/playhouse for adults.  There are so many fun things here- Life sized Connect Four, huge beanbag toss, shuffleboard on the inside. Lots of beanbag chairs and seating areas are pretty plentiful. There's no waitress service, but there is a big bar and a few mini-bars around. The main bar is pretty busy, but the bartenders move quickly, so there wasn't too much of a wait.  The best thing about this place is outside! I think that it is called \"The Backyard.\" I really wish that it hadn't been so chilly, because I would have loved to explore it more. I saw life-sized Jenga, more beanbag throws, beer pong, playhouses, a skating rink and a guy singing with a guitar! They had space heaters around, but it just wasn't enough to combat the chill for me. There were lots of people out there, but I am a punk when it comes to the cold!  There was also a DJ spinning some pretty fun songs. I love to dance, but I didn't see many people doing it. Maybe later in the night, there's more dancing? It would be great if so!   I know that there are other rooms/areas that we didn't get to see. I can't wait to come back when the weather is warmer!"}
{"text":"Why so rude, doorman? Were you mad because my sister and I interrupted your conversation with your buddy?  Considering what a ghost town your lounge was at 10:30pm, you'd think they might have made an effort to not offend guests."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Gold Spike and we had a great time! My friend and I played oversized jenga, Lego blocks, and pogs. It's definitely a different from the strip and a great place for a more lowkey vibe: The music was great as well. The keystone to our time here was definitely the amazing drinks. We were recommended the white gummy bear, and it's absolutely delicious. Our bartender, Charlie, was so great he completely made our experience 10x better. If you come, find Charlie and he will make your drinks incredible. 10/10 would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest place I've been to. There's something to do for everyone. Its very chill, good place for dancing and playing jumbo games. The deejay in the lounge plays food music and so does the live band outside."}
{"text":"When I'm out, I'm usually at a club. But sometimes, I just want to chill with friends without being pushed in all directions, while in heels. And thus, Gold Spike has turned into the best alternative.   The space is absolutely huge and open indoors and outdoors. There are a series of games throughout the bar from life-size Jenga to the ultimate college throwback: beer pong. You could spend hours with friends without even noticing the time going by. The bartenders are also always friendly and helpful, which is an added plus!"}
{"text":"This is a decent casino in Downtown Las Vegas. They have a night club that gets packed on the weekends but charge a cover.   If you're in the DTLV area it's worth a visit if you do t want to go to an expensive/ dressy club.   The crowd that attends the club and frequents the casino are primarily locals.   Drinks are cheap if you're not playing but lines do get long as there aren't many bars inside."}
{"text":"I was there for the onesie bar crawl on April 7th. I bought 2 rounds of beer (3 beers each round). I was charged $23 and $29 for the beer, plus a $30 \"courtesy pay fee per transaction. So I ended up being charged $112 for 6 beers. Is this a normal charge schedule??"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the food haha. Loaded Tater Tots....need I say more? And these guys are open allllllll night!"}
{"text":"Decided to stay here for my boyfriends birthday, and was rather impressed with the staff, quality of the rooms and prices. We stayed Thursday-Saturday. The hotel has a modern feel, no clocks, no phones in the room I was bummed there was no iron either but I went down to the office and they sent one up within an hour. The security is no joke here, so don't forget your key plus it's needed to go up and down the elevator. Will at the front desk was extremely personable and even showed us his Rubix cube skills, (in under 30 seconds) the outside games make it a playground for adults. Life size beer pong, chess, cornhole, Jenga, ping pong, pool! There's an outside room for beer pong and octopong. We had so much fun. Will definitely be staying here again. Block away from Fremont street, it was perfect!"}
{"text":"We stayed at this hotel so we were at the bar everyday but not during the club hours. The bartenders and servers at fiddlestix were great. We were provided drink coupons and coffee coupons, which was a great incentive. I really wanted to try the food but we were always out when we were hungry and forget trying to get a drink at night while the club was packed! Can't wait til next time!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people for husbands birthday. Had never played cornhole before and it was so much fun. Lots of variety of games. Place gets really packed. Live band outside, Dj inside. Even have ice skating. Free games, free entry, but drinks are typical prices. Kind of disappointed they dont sell buckets since mostly groups go here. Just for 3 beers each for husband and i its almost $20 and whats 2 beers going to do. Staff here wasnt very friendly though. But overall great exp overall. Even have 24 hr grill and the food is good and its cheap. Would def. Recommend but only to people who like to have fun"}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review for this place. But I guess not.  Drinks: Moderately priced. Well, pricing $$$ is at a downtown price.  Food: I ask the most ridiculous way of cooking my food. Uhm extra eggs with that burger? All hot sauces please? They do it, so tip well.  Entertainment: Games? OMG Giant Jenga? Giant beer pong? live entertainment? Let's just all hang out here!  Service: The servers and the bartenders seriously become your friends the first food/drink they serve. They're just THAT friendly.  Parking: Good luck finding parking on the next door lot but if you can't, down the street."}
{"text":"I was excited too finally come downtown check out another part of new downtown. I  heard about it from friends about Gold Spike lot has changed over and totally different vibe from the crowd too the look. One that say that FAN of! I understand talk about diversity in crowds literally 20's, 30;s, and be nice 40++. It makes for not only good place too people watch but good way reflect on life? Maybe. End about drinking, hanging out, enjoying life. Gold Spike is great spot too do it. The oversize board games. I played connect four with group of friends hanging out for birthday celebration. Only negative thing say is dam not enough yellow disks. Make sure Red or win early then later. Other games shuffleboard, bean bag toss, and big fifty shades of gray bed chill on. Dartboards, and couple nice pool tables. If bar game looking for sure Gold Spike had them all in regular or oversize fashion. If the place is packed you might have too wait but for the most part no one hogging the games. We played made sure let other people get their connect four on. If games get boring they have dj spinning music inside and outside you have live band playing (we were there for few hours so heard two different bands). The outside patio area is pretty cool. I like the set up with small outdoor lounge area in one corner then have couch and comfy chairs kick back hear the band outside. They have heaters outside too. Between the inside and outside. It kind of interesting that almost little sections that see groups just hanging out talking stories and enjoying life. Gold Spike is good time. Sure its nice diversity in downtown from maybe more classy downtown bars and has personality all its own. One that would recommend check out once or make part of any bar crawl downtown style!!!"}
{"text":"Fun filled bar in downtown. They have tons of life sized games for you to play while enjoying some drinks with your friends and family.   Life size beer pong? Shuffle board, Jen ga, ping pong?! Need I say more.  Sundays are 2 for 1 too, uh hello easy call!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with this spot! Bein gamers & a bit competitive ones at that its was the best place for a Xander & Jhonny reunion. Tossed back some bombs! The bartender chicks were super cool & not just fake nice for tips. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool place to chill. They've converted the old casino into a bar/lounge where you can come hang, grab some drinks and play games. Inside, they have comfy couches, beds and bean bag chairs you can sit/lay on, as well as tables and stools in the bar area. Drinks here are pretty cheap (most shots and beers were 5-6 bucks), although it gets crowded so you may have to wait a while during the busy evenings. There's also a restaurant/cafe in the back, where the food is pretty good, although I've only tried it once. They have darts, foosball, bags/cornhole, giant connect four and pool inside that you can play. They also have board games that you can check out to play. The DJ played mostly hip hop and top 40 music.  There is also an outdoor patio area that includes a stage where a live band usually plays on weekend evenings, an ice skating rink for winter and a small bar and snack/concessions area. The band was pretty good and the sound was excellent for a small set up.   I've been here a few times and have had a great time. It's a cool place to chill during the evenings or watch sports during a Sunday."}
{"text":"4 bartenders for 154 trivia teams?! Wtf... Almost 10:00 and we still have 3 trivia rounds to go? Everyone left. This is the wooooooorst..."}
{"text":"This place was reallly cool!!  Mostly in NY we pay for entering places like this, so it was a good change and I had lots of fun!  Dared friends to drinking games..because I am who I am.  Bartender was super exceptional, courteous and provided great pours as well as great service!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't gove off that motel feel. The bed sheets are CLEAN, the rooms are trendy, and the entire resort is super hipster. The pool isn't heated (can't use during the few winter months), they play pop music outside that you can hear from your room. Yes, they do provide ear plugs.  Me and my party were pleasantly surprised with the decor for such a cheap rate. We didn't expect the shower floor to be made out of pebbles, or the lamps be recycled art, etc."}
{"text":"Worse establishment ever. Place went to shit. Cover charges is more than any of the clubs in Vegas. The security are pricks. They lost my ID and didn't take accountability for it. The bartenders take forever to get to you so good luck getting a drink. Honestly I will never go back to this place. Sad seeing a place you went to a lot during you early 20s go so far down hill."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here. My only complaints involve the restrooms which are usually dirty and the men's door is OPEN where you can see urinal users in all their glory in the mirror as you walk by. Poor design and execution. No pun intended."}
{"text":"Gio was the get bouncer.  We had a good time partying this club for my sis bachelorette party. Thank you  Gio"}
{"text":"There no argument that i LOVE the Gold Spike. I've stayed here when the hotel was open and the rooms were modern and comfortable. Now that the hotel section is closed they removed the casino and turned the place into a \"hang out\" . Its a big living room with chairs, counches, beds, games, drinks and food!! Where else in Vegas can you come just to \"hang out\".....dare i mention the ice rink for skating"}
{"text":"Came here at 2am after a night out.  Ordered the chicken and waffles. Everything was great and the server was attentive."}
{"text":"Super young environment. If you like hip hop they play a mixture of old and new. Outside they play alternative and rock which isn't really my thing but it's safe to say they play a mixture of something everyone would like. I think it's cool that there are pool tables inside and a decent size dance floor. It's a great place to go on first Fridays. I'd say check it out."}
{"text":"Gisela is rude every time I've been here too eat.  She has ignored us multiple times and continues to be disrespectful each vist.  She wears long acrylic nails and if your drunk and don't notice those nails will touch your food, which not only is gross but against health code violations. Her customer service is horrible and so are her health standards."}
{"text":"Gold Spike is such a fun and diverse place to go.  I seriously have such a wonderful time everytime I come here. There is so much to do at Gold Spike. Its not just a bar but an adult playground! They have great life sized games such as janga, connect 4, and beer pong. They have the classics like darts, and ski ball.  At Gold Spike I feel like I can be a kid again and let loose! There is always a great atmosphere and live music on the weekends in the backyard.   For those who have not yet gone, it is an absolute treasure. I assure you it will be your new favorite destination. See you on the four square course!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday party at Gold Spike and had a blast. The manager and staff members were overly helpful and the food was amazing! Very chilled place that includes games, music, and drinks in a drama free environment! Love Gold Spike!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots downtown because it is so chill. It has music, a dance floor, and a bar similar to any club - but you don't have to be in club attire to get in. Jean shorts and a T-Shirt is all I need and I can go drink the night away. The inside and the outside are both HUGE. They check your I.D. at the door and pat down people coming in for security reasons which I appreciate, it makes me feel at least 10% safer. The only con is that sometimes even when it is not busy all three bars take so long to serve you! The lines for alcohol are insane.   They also have a dart board, a giant \"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL\" sign, giant beer pong, four square, a giant jenga, and a lot of seating. At least there was a lot this last time I went, it was a Sunday night so it wasn't busy. I have never paid cover to get in here but some friends have said they do charge on certain nights.  Basically, what I am saying is I have never had a bad experience here and I will be back."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in Downtown Las Vegas and it's at night and I'm with friends I'll most likely be at Gold Spike. One of my favorite Downtown places to hang out and definitely have a good time.  NO COVER, always a plus. Free ways to entertain yourself. There's usually a band or DJ playing outside in the huge back area where it's just awesome. The giant game of Jenja, great game just beware of toppling pieces. The giant game of beer pong, to bad the cups aren't filled with alcohol. haha I'd probably earn myself a trip to the hospital after one game. Four square game. Giant game of chess. Darts, corn hole, shuffleboard. etc. There's a two bars, one an actual full bar on the inside and another one outside which is smaller. If it's busy at the inside bar their have servers walking around in the inside or maybe go to the outside bar. Drink prices aren't to bad, not cheap but not expensive. Haven't ate there. Lots a places to relax. Large bean bags. A bed right in the middle for when you find that nice girl and can't wait.  Small parking lot and does get filled but you can park at the Downtown Grand or any of the other businesses nearby."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here! The music is great and the foods good! Play awesome games and enjoy the atmosphere! Lindsay is an awesome waitress!! I came in with a big party and she took care of us really well ! Come on down to Goldspike. I'm definitely coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Variety of games to entertain the crowd while drinking.   Cornhole, tetherball, giant beer pong, foosball, small table games, pool, Jenga, and carnival games are all games you can play. He foosball table is severely worn down and it is hard to play because the table is broken and the sticks with the players on it are not locked on to the table so will pop out when you're playing if you play aggressively. I was so bummed because I thought there was soccer pool but there isn't so don't expect that.   Outside are where majority of the games are as well as a large stage that either a live band will play on or if you're brave enough can sing karaoke from along with the band (they also have an iPad to read lyrics off of).  There's bars    Located inside and out, leaving you with a short wait time at the bar.   I highly recommend this place if you like playing games while you drink!"}
{"text":"Gold spike is really fun. This is usually my go-to bar when I want to go out with my friends or if I have people in from out of town. I believe I have written a review on Gold Spike before and it was a good review. However the review I'm going to write right now is not a good one unfortunately... I was throwing a bachelor/ bachelorette party this last weekend and I had 10 people with me, I had plans of bringing everybody to Gold Spike for months. Telling everyone how awesome this bar was, the adult games, the atmosphere, the entertainment, everything was awesome there! well we get there and two of the people in our group of 10 we're wearing plain white t-shirts and because they were wearing white t-shirts we were not let in. They told us if they had writing on them it would be okay but a plain white T-shirt was not acceptable. I live in Las Vegas and I absolutely realize there is a dress code for most everywhere you go but a white f****** t-shirt are you kidding me!?! All of us looked very nice, we were probably were more dressed up than we should have been for Gold Spike to be quite honest with you... so because two people in our group of 10 were wearing plain white shirts they turned our business down. I personally was very upset because I come here all the time and I come with groups of people to this bar all the time, I also sign up for the contests they hold here. So the fact that I talked this place up and had plans of bringing 10 people here that were from out of state and didn't get in really pissed me off. It completely ruined our plans for the whole night. And that whole night was on me because I was the one who planned it. Gold Spike is more of a light, casual, fun bar, it's not a f****** club, so the fact that they are so strict on someone wearing a white T-shirt is really annoying...ESPECIALLY because it was a big group of people. And no where does it say that white t-shirts aren't allowed... nothing posted on the website and nothing posted outside the bar, so Gold Spike I recommend you put up your dress code up somewhere for people to see it for... that really wasn't fair and you're also about to get 10 s***** ass reviews now all over all over two plain white t-shirts..."}
{"text":"One of the best spots to visit for a good time out on the weekend in Downtown Las Vegas. Admission cover charges can be pretty steep depending on the event that is happening that day or weekend. Once you're in, you hear loud music, see a dance floor and different bars where you can purchase some drinks.  It is a great place to meet some friends and have a good time. They have an outdoor area with a stage and different life sized toys like chess and tether all and four square."}
{"text":"If you're a big kid at heart, this is the place for you. They have all kinds of life size games to play, connect four, twister, giant trash can beer pong, regular beer pong, jenga, pool and more. The drinks are pretty pricey. We always go pregame at one of the bars on Fremont that has super chea shots and then come down here to play games and hangout. They have food too. I've only ever tried my friend's chicken fingers and they were good. Some nights they have a live band in the back patio area which is cool. After a certain hour, there is a cover charge to get in. If I remember right, it was free for ladies and $10 for guys. On weekends it gets really crowded too. The girls line for the bathroom can be a pretty long wait. A lot dont know, but if you head outside and go right towards the pool, they're let you back there to use the bathrooms out there. It's a fun atmosphere and definitely for the younger crowd. It's a cool spot to hangout at, if you don't mind the crowds."}
{"text":"This was a great find! If you're looking for a fun alternative to clubbing, this place is it! I got here pretty late.. I believe around 1am so it wasn't too packed but there were still plenty of people. The restaurant inside has pretty solid food.. not too bad! Service was also friendly and chipper for it being the middle of the night.  I didn't drink here but the games were pretty cool ! They have a huge jenga, pool with soccer bolls, beer pong, four square, regular and jumbo size corn hole, hop scotch and more! Definitely check this place out if you're looking for something fun/chill to do with your friends."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went to meet a large group of friends here to celebrate one of the birthdays in the group. I wondered what made them choose The Gold Spike, I had been there in the past and it was a decent enough bar, casino lobby but nothing to brag about. Ha! They are bragging now! This place rocks! Finally a place in town that's not a loud techno dropping, smokey, crowded, expensive hot mess! LOVED it!   My BF said got your ID ready and I'm thinking why they heck to they need that at the door. I imagine my eyes where wide open in shock as we stepped through the door. It's wide open with the bar and the little deli still in tacked but they have removed the slot machines and added random lounge spots with couches, bean bags, large comfy chairs and tall tables as well. They've added pool tables and over sized games, giant corn hole, yard jenga, giant beer pong, giant connect four and much more! Outside is an even awesomer, yea I went there, lounge area with more seats and a band and another bar. I'm sure I missed some of the other features but it was love at first sight. I love that it was big and there were a lot of people but you wouldn't know, unless you were waiting on drinks at the bar, because you were not bumping into people. Speaking of the bar, which was busy and pretty slow to get served, I'm not sure pricing, I didn't pay but you could get a pitcher of PBR for $12, not terrible. There is no smoking inside so you don't go home smelling like an ash tray and have to wash your hair again after you already washed it to go out.  Did I tell you I love this place! We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"When you think of a lounge, you think of a place with a dancefloor, right?  Not so at Gold Spike.  Board games are the name of the game here, along with a diner, shuffleboard tables, and a wall of hot sauce. It's different, but that is by no means bad."}
{"text":"Total shit hole.  That being said, it appears to be a locals only total shit hole, which endears it to me.  My friends and I stopped here to pre-game (since Yelp looks down on Gold Spike favorable for a casual drink).  But there was feets balls happening on TV, and my friends and I were apparently dressed up enough to stick out like sore thumbs.  But consider that pours are -extremely- generous and do with this place what you will."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and play a game or just hang out.  Started coming here with my gaming friends, the tables are big enough for tabletop games and the waiters will come to take your order anywhere in the \"Living Room.\" Angelina has been our waitress the last couple times and has been great.  Outside is the \"Backyard\" which has a ton of kids games for grow ups, and lots of seats. Once again.you can get a drink or food no matter where you sit the waitstaff will bring you libations."}
{"text":"Such a fun place in downtown Las Vegas!  Our tour guide at Zappos recommended I take our group of 35 people there for lawn games and reasonably priced drinks.  Happy hour provided great prices, the bartender handled our large group with ease and all of the games were a blast for our group that needed to spend some time between our Zappos tour and dinner at Therapy.  We played pool, ping pong, life size beer pong, Jenga and many other games.  There are plenty of places to kick back and relax too if games aren't your thing.  Such a fun place for a group!"}
{"text":"Brought my cousins who are visiting from Indiana here tonight. We had so much fun. The drinks were good. Food was quick. And the games in the back are a lot of fun. The bartenders were rather quick and the tall blonde lady at the door was really nice and helpful. Had a great time! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Sad. Rude security. Specially rude indoor security, very responsive (for no reason), bouncers also. Overall just not worth it. They should hire people with some education"}
{"text":"First off, great place my friends and I went for another friends birthday and it was all our first time. We loved the music inside the dance floor was great and outside was pretty cool too they have games like four square, life sized janga, beer pong with big trash cans and a soccer ball also they have this cute little house you can rent with tables on the outside and it's gated, super cute! The reason for my 4 stars is because we had an incident with one of the waitresses. My boyfriend and friend had ordered drinks (4) and she had only brought out 1 drink and she took forever! But she never returned my boyfriends and friends debit card and then when we tried to find her she was on break, we were asking around for her and the manager was very rude to my boyfriend when he simply just wanted his debit card back, nobody was looking for her we actually bumped into her and she apologized and charged us for the drinks and that was it. The costumer service needs improvement I don't know about you but since the day I started working retail they tell you costumer service is the #1 thing!"}
{"text":"What a great experience last night! Crossed off our vacation trip list! Thanks to BRETT my daughters friend for his hospitality last night!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So we stayed at the oasis for my wedding (I'm a local). This was just a few weeks ago. And before we headed off to the chapel, I killed some time with my bridesmaids and parents at the goldspike! So much fun! I've always loved this bar! I just think everyone that works there is so kind and funny! Thank you for being a part of my memorable weekend."}
{"text":"Food is fire great place to kickit. A lot of things to do..  come here all the time from out of state not a local."}
{"text":"Low life security trying to ruin your vacation. I was a guest at the hotel and kept getting check in and out every time I wanted to take a beer out of the building so disrespectful security. Low budget security guards have nothing better to do than to check your Corona."}
{"text":"This place is TONS of fun!  Management is on top of things, staff is attentive.  We were a large party and David, our server, was totally on point.  He's got a great memory, is advance thinking, and gave us outstanding service!  We hope he serves us next time!"}
{"text":"I Had so much fun at Gold Spike last night for a friend's birthday party!  We had a table outside...our waitress ( Bernadette )was awesome!!  The manager Adam and the security team was very helpful and took great care of us :) this is my new favorite spot in Las Vegas ! I'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"FUN!!!! I love the relaxed atmosphere of Gold Spike. It is a down to earth spot to feel like a kid again.  It is a place to enjoy with affordable drinks that are a nice change of pace from the Strip. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Always a delicious meal! Though this is my first review, this is one of dozens of visits here. Fiancee is enjoying the Steak and Eggs, and he is enjoying them to the fullest! I have decided on the usual eggs Benedict, which is as perfect as ever! We are being taken care of by Pinto, one of our favorites, who regrettably is leaving to start at the Boozery tomorrow!  Another exciting moment today was that the owner, Mr. Hsieh, is doing a walkabout with our honorable Senator Harry Reid!  What a fun breakfast adventure!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I have an absolute blast! Heather and Fred are by far the best bartenders. Always ask for one of them they'll make your experience at Gold Spike unforgettable and fun! Heather has the greatest sense of humor she'll make sure you leave smiling and happy"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Good food. Great prices.  Breakfast is served all day! I ordered the Steak and Eggs, which included a 7oz steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns and toast for $9.99. The steak was perfectly prepared!  They also have a ton of hot sauces to chose from! (At least 100) There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"0200: The first night/morning I was there back in late June hammered, and just wanted to sleep face down on the big bed   bed while celebrating a birthday; as she read 50 Shades to those who had been going hard since 1800 celebrating with us. I believe fried food was involved and Justin Bieber dropped by. Some of this may or may not be true after: Park, Commonwealth, Laundry Room, Commonwealth...and shots here. Not used to that many drinks, especially mostly outside, in late June annnnd it showed!   The second time was wayyyy more coherent. After a fab sushi dinner @ Yummy, we (Beet, Lindsey, Rod & brief Betty Draper appearance at TLR) stopped in. No more photo booth, oh well. Still a cool space and I'd trust Norm K on breakfast all day long. (It was after Ju's greatness @ TLR and only 1-ish) Lots more people outside enjoying the \"backyard\" vibe.   Didn't stay second time too long before we were off to \"Talk Like a Pirate Day\" at Frankie's Tiki Lounge. Definitely want to check out the Airstream and \"yard\" for games and think it works as a place to hang casual DTLV. Service was super friendly, even the nice security guard who tried to listen to my mushed by being face down on the couch undoubtedly brilliant argument for staying there first time (instead I slept in my car @ El Cortez for a few hours till I was truly ready to go.)..seemingly good times no matter how you choose to/end up rolling. Same guard, nice guy!   Yelp 100 Challenge"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover, as they say. From the outside this block looks a little forgotten. And walking up we were met with what I'll describe as a not-so-user-friendly door guy who scanned our faces for, I dunno, I can't even pretend to have any kind of reasoning behind the lack of privacy in modern life anymore. Maybe he stole my soul with his face scan, but nonetheless they scanned me and I went in.  From there things went on the up and up. You lose the lack of curb appeal and enter to find a big, open bar and seating area. The friendly fella slinging drinks poured me a mean Sprite and we headed outside. Indoors there was plenty of seating, but outside is where the party is at.  The place has a chunk of real estate and they're working it. The back is a grownup kid-at-heart's dream: four square, tetherball, massive cornhole, a stage for music, and probably a bunch of other things I'm forgetting. We jumped into the cornhole foray, and then played some four square with a bunch of tipsy kids. And by kids, I mean legal drinking age, but blowing off steam after work. They were fun, but had no clue how to play and as a champ of the 5th grade courts, I can tell you it should be all underhand, all day, two hand touch.  I reigned supreme at tetherball and felt it in my shoulder the next day, but I wrought destruction on my foes. I looked like an idiot, but when your pals are talking smack you wrap the top of the pole and walk away like a boss. Thanks, 6th grade.  Super fun spot to hang out. No idea how it plays out when it gets packed. Our weeknight visit was not super bumping, but I preferred it that way. More discovery, less jostle. Get past the street and the scan and play on."}
{"text":"After a dinner at morels and a couple drinks on Fremont. Some friends and I went here and as we walked up to the door...the peasant doormen told me I was too drunk? I don't really know how they got that judgment...as I was nowhere near \"too drunk\" - I was still 100% coherent - I had my ID out ready to go. Lol. Anyways.... the poor boy door men I guess discriminate on people that look like they are having fun. Lol. Oh well...I feel bad about actually not reviewing the place itself. But when you have low life, peasants at the door that don't give a chance...it's hard. Lol. Anyway...maybe I'll get to go in one day."}
{"text":"Most memorable stop of the night.   I love how there is no gambling just drinking, music, games, and super cool places to chill. They also have an outdoor area with fire pits to relax with friends or listen to a band play.   GOOD TIMES"}
{"text":"The live band was great! The first time I got a beer the bartender was really nice and quick to serve me. The 2nd time I tried to get a beer was a terrible ordeal. The bartender whom was a male would not acknowledge my drink order. Continued to talk to other customers while looking right at me and laughing pretty much in my face. I don't usually write bad reviews but this was a very uncomfortable experience and I wouldn't want it to happen to anyone else again. After asking one more time for like the 3rd time for the beer I wanted the bartender exclaimed \"you are drunk\"! This was my 2nd beer of the night. I was very tired but was not drunk by any means. The gentleman proceeds to say loudly to his manager \"this girl is drunk\". I decided to leave my friends standing there and exit the place but could not find an exit right away. While outside making a call to my friends to meet me and leave a gentlemen walks up to me and tells me that I need to come with him (again very uncomfortable). He takes me to a door outside opens it and tells me to leave and that I was caught on camera drunk? I just didn't know what to think. I was left to stand out on a dark street alone and waiting for my friends who weren't able to find me right away because I wasn't at the entrance we came in at. Overall, would return for the music and venue but will not buy anything from this establishment ever again. Was really looking forward to trying the food too but didn't even make it to do that because of this experience happening."}
{"text":"Goldspike has been my go-to bar ever since I moved to Las Vegas 2 years ago. It is ALWAYS open, so its a great starting point to meet with friends if you're looking for the Fremont experience. It's a lot more laid back than any of the bars and lounges you'll find on the strip, and the drinks are about half the price too! Inside you'll find a dance floor, giant cornhole, and comfy beds and booths to relax on. In the back they have a giant chess board and giant jenga for patrons looking for some fun and games. I've always had a pleasant experience with the staff here, especially the bartenders.   TIP: Sometimes the security can be a bit strict about the dress code so make sure you check what you wear before coming!"}
{"text":"While in DTLV and having and action packed morning after the CMYE at O face doughnuts, some friends of the family invited us to the Gold Spike.  I admit I have not been here since the remodel and takeover by the DTP.  So I of course was enthusiastic about going on this beautiful spring afternoon.  At first I was a little ify about being kid friendly but that was quickly put down when the security at the door said \"come on in, just stay away from the bar area\".  Cool No problem even though It would have been refreshing having a cold adult beverage on a great weather day like today.    We quickly wandered into the back patio area and were pleasantly surprised to see tons of entertainment to be had by all ages with the many games available.  They have a huge Jenga game, ping pong, foosball, four square, hop scotch, giant chess board, beer pong and everyone's favorite corn hole. The back space also had great music playing and the property also had a really cool Airstream trailer and \"Tiny House\" available for use as a meeting space.  Free WiFi is available for everyone which is great during the day because many people use the \"Gold Spike as an office or meeting of the minds for lots of \"Brain Thinking\" stuff.   Inside the Gold Spike is a bar and also a place for food called \"Grill\".  Service was not the greatest because they had one women  running the entire restaurant with two cooks.  Mind you that it was mid afternoon and they had no diners inside, but we ordered at the counter and asked to have food delivered outside which was no problem.  After all it was an amazing weather day so we had to enjoy.  The kids really enjoyed playing the games and the adults didn't seem to mind if they were tearing about.    The food came out within a reasonably quick time.  At a glance, I could tell that they were using good quality ingredients.  This was not you typical bar food.  We ordered the loaded Nachos which was made with colored corn tortilla chips and had tons of melted cheese, salsa, guacamole and Jalapeno's.  I was expecting loaded to include beef, sour cream and maybe some beans but either way they were good and a large portion to share.   Next we had the fried Zucchini which came with a side of marinara for dipping.  Very good sized lightly breaded sticks fried to perfection and sprinkled with shredded, melted cheese.  Yummy!    I had the Turkey Club on Sourdough bread and again this was a  very good sandwich with lots of turkey and crisp bacon and the bread was very delicious.  Another large portion with a mound of fries perfect for sharing.    My friend had they Ruben which looked delicious on grilled marble rye and by the looks of his plate being nearly licked clean my assumption is that It \"WAS\" delicious.  Overall good experience at the Gold Spike today.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Not gourmet by any means but everything had good fresh ingredients and the portions were filling.  The atmosphere was fun and playful, and I look forward to coming back to this place for some adult fun one night."}
{"text":"Just spent a week there. Great place to visit but not stay. If you want to sleep at all this is both the place for you. If you like to party then yes.  The last night I stayed there I had a work friend come visit we saw two fights and several people throwing up into trash cans.  One bright spot is the staff is really nice. Again, great place to visit just don't sleep there."}

The former City Hall building (now Zappos corporate office), and more recently, The old Gold Spike. The Gold Spike Hotel and Casino was a true dive, even by old school Downtown Las Vegas standards. Once the CEO of Zappos started aggressively buying up DTLV real estate, he turned his hipster vision into a reality and now a lot of the modern hipsteresque DTLV is the culmination of his vision and of course money.   Now understand, this is not a direct criticism. I highly respect the man for investing so much in an area of Las Vegas that was truly the definition of dilapidated. Creating Container Park, making use of the former City Hall, and revamping many tired areas is all worth praise, but sometimes, things just go to far.  Case in point: The Gold Spike. At one time, a great low brow casino joint that you could get $1 beers and $.50 roulette. Now, the Gold Spike doesn't even offer gambling of any kind. The Gold Spike is now a non-gaming hotel that has turned their once classic dive casino into a hipster's wet dream of a bedroom. Beds everywhere, pool tables with fur covered handcuffs, a patio and courtyard with human Jenga, beer pong with trash cans, and 3 foot tall chess pieces. And of course, a repurposed Jetstream.   This Gold Spike would make Jackie Gaughan turn over in his grave.   It's a hipster hangout of every 19-20 year old Vegas kid with his older brother's ID. I've been there twice and that is two times more than I needed to go.   I miss the old Gold Spike. The revitalization of DTLV is truly a wonderful thing, but even it can go to far. And it certainly has at the old Gold Spike."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED FOR:  ~BIG KIDS! ~Groups looking for a fun atmosphere     I've been to the Gold Spike a couple of times and luckily at slow times so we could head in with no cover and check things out.  Once was at the holidays and they had an ice skating rink in the \"backyard\".  I just love the vibe and all of the games and overall \"fun\" they have going on.  I'd love to go back with a group of friends and hang out longer and have some fun."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Always heard of it but never checked it out until recently. The place is huge! Drinks were decent, music could have been a little better but after speaking with the DJ I noticed the tunes were on point! The outdoor section was my favorite although it was a little cold, the heaters kept the group comfortable."}
{"text":"The staff at the door are rude and they charge you a cover for re-entry.  There is not enough seating for all the people and the food is not great.  The main attraction is oversized games like beer pong and jenga."}
{"text":"Our server Anne Marie was so sweet and attentive. The atmosphere outside was so fun and the food was amazing and prices great! I would for sure come back here!"}
{"text":"Great laid back place to hang out. Encourages you to look away from your phone and interact with people. Very friendly staff and great service! Love the \"Downtown Dog\" at the grill but you have to get it as a wrap!"}
{"text":"If you've a Vegas local, you already know you'll end up here in the midst of your binge drinking adventures Downtown. This place is super fun and it's filled with different characters and personalities. They have a lot of games you can play inside and outside their facility. It's a great place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in downtown!  Come in, grab a drink from the bar, and dance.  Go outside to the other bar, grab another drink, and play the cornhole toss.  Hang out by the fire pits and chat.  Come back inside and play the carnival games in the corner, or shoot some pool.  Grab another drink by the bar and lounge on the giant bed.  End the night at the diner with a midnight snack!  I'd come here every weekend if I was a local!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar in all of LV. I say that as an incredibly competitive person, because Gold Spike is filled with all sorts of games and activities AND has good music, AND has good drinks, AND is large enough to hold the crowds on Fri and Sat nights. No pushing sweaty drunk people out of my way to get to the bar to get another Downtown Brown for me thank you. Give me a beer and a ping pong paddle and you've got yourself one very happy lady!!!   You WILL have a good time if you come here. Life-size chess. Darts. Giant beer pong. Foursquare. Hopscotch. Connect Four and other board games. DJ Booth with ample inside seating that you do NOT have to reserve.   My only advice is that you be very specific when ordering cocktails, e.g. Old Fashioneds. My first one was delicious and I specified Makers, the second one was made by someone else with Jim Beam and was 60% bitters, 20% whisky, and 20% some mysterious brown concoction and then was muddled and crushed and shaken into oblivion. Basically an entirely different drink altogether. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I really want to give Gold Spike 5 stars. Their backyard with all the games is great, some of their employees are awesome, their food is good, but the service is just too hit or miss.    When they weren't busy its taken 30 minutes to get a drink in their backyard and we had a group of 10.  if you go to the bar to get a drink some bartenders are awesome and others are too busy chatting up customers to help you.  Some bartenders will happily help you out with getting things for the game and others will say they don't know.  I've had to go inside to ask about ordering food. But once I did they were super helpful.   Don't want to slam the place because it is fun and some of the staff does a great job.   Also at night they copy/scan your license and photograph everyone going in. I like this. It probably makes things safer. But they pretend they aren't doing this.  They'll ask a patron to move a little to get them close to the camera but not tell them why and they don't ask before scanning. They don't ask and I have no idea what they do with everyone's data and how it is safeguarded.  It's a cool safety thing. Just not cool to not disclose it or explain how they safeguard the data. I wouldn't want strangers getting a copy of my drivers license."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!  Basically it's a grown up playground with life size beer pong, jenga, Legos, & chess board.  On top of it, they have a huge game of twister, 4-square, pool, corn hole, and shuffleboard.  Inside there's a ginormous bed of pillows (2 queen beds pushed together) and we had a giant group cuddle party.  Although I only had the chance to eat some finger foods (wings, chicken strips, quesadillas, fries, etc) it was enough for me to give it a thumbs up.  However, I was too occupied being a kid again. In this playground area there was an RV trailer and I honestly wish I could have spent the night there.  Omg what fun!"}
{"text":"From 2/23/16 Gold spike  Came here for some grub, before a night of drinking. We had the best server that you can ask for Anne Marie, who was attentive and hilariously entertaining :-) .   We ordered our food, which came out pretty fast I got the Gold Spike Burger. It was so delicious; it's the kind of burger you should get if you don't care about calories. Haha.   When you're done with your food you can hang at the bar and grab drinks, there's the gaming area  where you can play oversize versions of beer pong, connect 4, chess, etc.   Of course, I will be back for more food, or get some stuff Postmates since they use them for delivery."}
{"text":"i put my drink down for 1 minute and they threw my drink away. i am so upset. i spent $10 for a drink and it got tossed. i will never come here again. i am so upset. please AVOID AT ALL COSTS. they steal your money, alcohol, respect, and enjoyment."}
{"text":"Gold Spike is one of my favorite joints on Earth, period. Every time I've gone, I've had a blast. Awesome music, outstanding service, great drinks and tons of fun. Do yourself a favor and check it out if or when you're in Vegas. You won't regret it.   On my way to Vegas now...see you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Ok so we came in for a late night business meeting... It's loud but business is getting done...   Sitting in cafe waiting on food ...we ordered hamburgers, hotdogs, and Tuna sandwiches...  Kinda nice while we were waiting I went to the bar and got tequila shots... Enjoyed them while waiting for food..."}
{"text":"Your mouth gets treated to amazing import beers and tasty food. Not the best drink specials but the prices overall are still good. A lot better than other bars Downtown.   Your hands get treated to a great selection of fun games like oversized darts, oversized corn-hole, and oversized chess. You can also checkout board games to play with friends or complete strangers.   Your buns get treated to very comfortable seating complete with huge beanbag chairs or even lay down in bed and mingle.   Pretty great place to hang out. You can do a little work in the daytime with your laptop or do a little work at night with vodka.   Up to you buddy."}
{"text":"No, I did not come here for the chance to be on the real world, but I wouldn't be surprised if I made it. At the moment, I believe that the cast from the real world are staying here.   From my experience, Goldspike is supposed to be an adult clubhouse (21+) where you will likely have to show your ID to prove it. On Weekends after 10PM they have a $10 cover charge for guys and everyone is asked to wear classy attire. When I went though, my dress code did not meet those standards and I was not given a hard time. Staff is pretty chill and the crowd can get pretty thick on Fridays and Saturdays. If that's not your thing, perhaps it would be better to come on a weeknight.   The difference between coming on a weekday versus weekend is kind of crazy. Yes, this is Vegas, but it's not always a party here. The week days give you the chance to see how young adults have came and abused the luxuries of this establishment. The pool table's stained with beer with holes in the felt, the bathroom stalls don't close right, and the games you can rent are missing pieces.  I even saw a young man try to bounce a pool stick on a table. This place is the epitome of what you would expect to get when you give presents to ungrateful kids.   I'll be back because it offers a unique experience for adults, but I will shed a tear for the damages inflicted on this too generous of an establishment that truly encourages fun."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love beer and giant games for adults? Must try the adult-sized jenga!  It does get really packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"It was a Vegas Saturday afternoon like any other. My head was in a fog, my words slow, mouth dry and I was back on the prowl for a little hair of the dog, seeing as it was the only way to set things straight. As we stumbled into Gold Spike I was pleasantly surprised by the tranquility of the place. No ringing slots, no flashing lights and barely a soul in the room - a much needed escape from it all.  Drink in hand, we walked around the \"playground\" built for giants. Giant Jenga, giant beer pong, giant Connect Four and my favorite of the bunch, giant corn hole. Seriously, this was exactly what the doctor ordered! I wasted no time and grabbed some bean bags reminiscent of small bags of potatoes and proceeded to whip some ass while barely breaking a sweat. Actually, I didn't even break a sweat in the cool comforts of this air conditioned oasis... just drinks and bags, drinks and bags, drinks and bags. Not a bad Saturday and truly a great place to mix up the Vegas routine a bit."}
{"text":"Honestly so many things to say about this place and what it represents for the \"#dtlv community\" and for locals but what I'd like to make note of about this place is best put into bullet form:   -It gets SUPER crowded on the weekends, so if you're looking for a ho-tastic/bro-tastic time, that's the best time to go. Look towards the backyard bars for easier access to booze at these times.   -With that said, I like to go when it's not busy at all, usually early evenings or earlier on the weeknights. You get good amount of attention from the staff, no wait at all on the drinks and food, plugs and TVs all around if you wanna hang out and do some work, and good wifi. Not a bad deal. Also, the Bloody Mary's are delicious!  -Go easy on the bartenders, they're doing their best and they really are just like everyone else--not like the pretentious douchenozzles at other downtown watering holes that make you feel like you need a shower after ordering from them (coughCOMMONWEALTHcough).  -Food is decent. It used to be better when it was priced more reasonably, but for whatever reasons (be it DTP in \"financial jeopardy\" or capitalizing on the growing attention from locals and tourists or both--which is a whole other conversation) the prices have gone up twice in the last year and although the menu has changed, the food quality hasn't IMO. But when you're drinking/hungover and too lazy to find another place for food, the wings aren't bad, the burger isn't bad, and the breakfast isn't bad.    -Going back to the pricing, I know a lot of people have been complaining--like myself who have been going to the Gold Spike since before DTP acquired it and make it their little clubhouse. Yes, the quality has improved. Yes, selection is better. But $4.25 for a PBR draft? Come on, guys. Figure out your beer politics better and either get $2 PBR tall boy cans and use the tap for another craft beer to expand your selection. There are so many creative ways to make money at the bar and still make your regulars happy, it's just a matter of figuring it out and asking how other places do it. I know this place is and will always likely be a work in progress, but let's be reasonable here. A little research goes a long way.   P.S. My favorite bartenders are Virginia, Kaylee, Fred, Summer, Joe (but don't piss him off, trust me). And fine, Will is cool too. :P"}
{"text":"Horrible place to get lit.... They feel as if they are an actual nightclub in one of the prestigious Las Vegas resorts.... In reality, you're a bar in downtown Las Vegas.... In the muck.... I never feel safe there and security is an absolute joke. It reminds me of Paul Blart security enforcement at this mid-grade, at best, establishment. I'm not even this disappointed when I go to PT's Pub....."}
{"text":"This place is like my worst nightmare. I had an open mind coming here, even though I kinda knew the jist of this place was a lounge/bar with board games. I hate board games. In fact, I loathe them. This was like being stuck on a cruise ship and the only thing to do is board games.   My Jameson & Ginger Ale tasted like toilet water ( I assume it was the ginger ale from the gun) and the bartender was less than friendly. Not to mention, the parking lot was a joke, literally 30 spaces, maybe. One way only, so getting in and out was a delight. I never want to come here again."}
{"text":"This place is a great bar. The service is always fairly quick for how busy it tends to get, although I mainly go during the middle of the week due to my schedule. Anyone complaining about the prices should just stick to their local pubs because this is a unique bar and most bars on fremont are pricey anyways. In short you can't find a bar quite like this and I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Beer, Games, Music, Patio. Anytime I'm in DTLV I stop by always a good time."}
{"text":"Reserved a room for gold spike oasis though Priceline about a month in advanced.. show up to registration and the room we got was in the regular gold spike hotel. Noise wasn't bad as others said. Reminds me of a motel 6 in the room, and there was hair in the shower before we used it. Security was very well mannered and courteous. The outdoor games were fun but impossible to play as it was very busy."}
{"text":"Place is the chillest place i have ever been too bartender named fred made us feel right at home.  Theyve got a bunch fo games to play. Darts, beer/shot pong, huge jenha, regular corn hole, huge corn hole, large chess, table tennis, and this game where you throw soccer balls in each others trashcan basically like a huge beer pong game. Pricing is like any normal local bar, but we ordered during happy hour so most drinks are half off. Definetely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice now. The first time I went on a Friday and had an absolute blast, there was a live band, fun games to play and the entertainment was fabulous. I just went again this past Saturday and had such a horrible experience. There were drunk men everywhere hitting on people left and right, they literally made a tunnel to get into the door to go inside and were grabbing peoples butts and making comments, I felt so uncomfortable. I will go back because I love this place but not on a Saturday  late night... to many drunk idiots."}
{"text":"I had a good time. Liked the games, enjoyed the band, Danielle our waitress was too fun. Will come back for fun, music, drinks and relaxation."}
{"text":"3rd stop of the night was Gold Spike. I've been here numerous times before. I always seem to have a good time here. Sometimes I would just come to eat at the cafe located inside. And that is exactly what we did last night. We went straight to the Cafe. After all the cocktails from the previous bars we visited, we were all quite famished!   I ordered Steak nachos. It was pretty good. It had a side of guacamole, mild salsa & sour cream. The nachos were made up of the usual contents (cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeños, etc). It's a pretty big portion for me so I couldn't finish it. Sometimes when I order the nachos some of the chips would come out burnt which is weird.   Most of my friends got the chicken & waffles which is really popular here. I think they have one of the best waffles I ever had, but again I'm usually a couple cocktails in when I eat it. The chicken is pretty crispy. They also have like a hundred different hotsauces to choose from, all labeled with level of hotness.   The place is pretty spacious inside, they have an outdoor as well. They have giant size games which are really cool & different from other bars downtown. Only complaint I have is that they need more parking! Parking is such a struggle!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool bar I would say. They have life-sized board games like jenga, chess/checkers, cornhole, connect four, and these giant beer pong things. They also have pool tables and firebird outside and this random large bed. It's a really nice place to chill with a group of friends I would say.   I came here on a Sunday night around 8 and it didn't start to get busy around 10 but I didn't stay around too long to fully know how it gets later on. The drinks at the bar are I guess \"fairly priced\" it's just they skimp on the alcohol on drinks which is pretty lame. They also have a place to order food inside called, Grill or something. I only tried their herb fries and mozzarella sticks and it was pretty good but nothing special about them.   I guess overall it's a pretty neat place and I'd definitely come back again with more friends to enjoy it with."}
{"text":"Security here is a big issue. Would not let me in because I had a backpack. Offered to let him search it but they said no. Funny bc the dress code is marked at casual and there's nothing on their website about what you can and cannot wear. Seemed like I did not fit the mold of their typical customer or I dare say a racist maybe. Just used the backpack as an excuse. Would not recommend as there is no rational reason for not allowing backpacks into a casual venue like this even when being searched and having your photo taken."}
{"text":"i love how such a cool and fun spot was built in the space of one of Downtown Vegas' original hotel/casinos.  80's and 90's kids' childhood nostalgia meets vice of current age at Gold Spike. daybeds, love sac beanbags, and lounge chairs to relax at. a DJ spinning current and 90's dance hits. life-size Connect 4, dartboards, pool tables, bean bag toss. board games and card games you can check out and play with your party back at one of the tabes. and that's just the inside.  outside, there's a life-size Jenga and life-size beer pong, as well as an ice-skating rink (no idea if it's a permanent fixture or just something for the wintertime). more patio furniture, firepits, and heatlamps. even a band that plays live music.  the crowd is great here. the drinks are delicious, and you don't have to fight through a mass of people just go get an order in. you can forget (and enjoy) that you're not at one of the night clubs which are filled to capacity with all the bachelor/bachelorette parties or the 21st birthday celebrants or the young and crazy college kids that don't know how to hold their alcohol. you don't have to get on some sort of guestlist where the guy-girl ratio has to be a certain way. you're not waiting in line for hours or paying an exorbitant cover charge. you're not restricted to a small portion of the club's total space because you want to dance to some grooves.  the Downtown Vegas revival looks bright with attractions like Gold Spike, the Container Park, Insert Coin(s), etc.  -civilities."}
{"text":"They have some fun activities inside and a large dance floor but the fun really begins when you head to the outdoor space.  There's tons of games in giant form including a giant jenga and giant beer pong. It's a fun casual crowd when you need a break from the strip.    I agree with previous reviews that this place is definitely pretty strict about their dress code."}
{"text":"This past weekend, my partner had a party here for her job promotion. We reserved the Tumbleweed for the party, but since it was so hot outside, they let us take it inside until 9pm. Our server was Ann Marie and she was AWESOME!!! If you're planning on having a party here, place a request in for Ann Marie. She was very attentive with all our guests, very professional and super sweet!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that I've been to many clubs and lounges both on the Strip and Downtown and I feel like Gold Spike is the ultimate chill spot to go to. Great music, fun games, & attentive and fun bartenders! (Big shoutout to Will who made those Midori Sours pretty bomb & to Brittney who made amazing Pineapple upside down drinks for me and my two friends all night long! Super attentive, gave us great suggestions for drinks & was wonderful to talk to! THANKS GIRL!) Overall a great atmosphere & definitely one of my fav chill spots to hangout with friends and meet new people in DTLV!"}
{"text":"CROWDED!!!!  too bad, I used to like the cafe.   LOUD!!!  I normally like fun places, but this place is just too jammed, 'cause it's free to park for customers, no cover and reasonable drink prices."}
{"text":"Interesting place. It's like recess for adults. Giant jenga, giant corn hole, giant beer pong, bean bags, board games.  Didn't try the food. The bathroom was super clean and nice, and the whole place had a really nice smell. But the bartenders suck, they were rude and only paid attention to a group of young women."}
{"text":"It really sucks to have to write this because I've been a long time customer of this establishment. However, two weeks ago the security guards of this place were incredibly disrespectful towards one of the female members of our group. We had a member of our party actually staying in the hotel and as we were trying to enter the bar one of the bouncers denied her entry. When we asked for a reason he became belligerent. The amount of physical bullying/forcing that was exerted to deny a tiny girl entry was ridiculously shameful. The bar has gone downhill and I can assure it's due to the mysogynistic bouncers that they employ. If you have any respect for the downtown seen and the integrity of the Las Vegas culture avoid this bar at all costs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots downtown ! There's a lot of stuff to do as far as games and they have good drinks. Also their security staff is super cool !"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.  All dart boards, foosball, cornhole, giant jenga etc.  Drinks are a little overpriced and the bartenders are for speed not properly made drinks.   Place could use better ventilation.   A bit stuffy inside.  Also smoking is not allowed,  although most of the idiot smokers didn't seemed to heed those rules"}
{"text":"Great adult sized games and definitely a great time! Love coming here."}
{"text":"Had a great time here though I did go on a Friday and it was busy but still had no problem getting drinks or having fun. Four square jenga giant beer pong darts and corn hole with friends while drinking what is not to love. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it used to be a hidden gem now everyone goes there."}
{"text":"last time i was there all the toilets flooded.and no one that worked there could care less that people were walking around in others urine and fecal toilet water. aside from all the high school students with fake ids walking around the place is great (sarcasm). the door men are low intelligence high school drop outs. one of which smelled strongly of marijuana.so if you want to walk around a crowded bar with toilet water on the floor and possibly commit statutory rape, than look no further."}
{"text":"Place was awesome.  Bartender named Jeff shouldn't have been bartending. Awefulllll service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this place...they have life size games and not just the basic giant jenga and beer pong but twister, cornhole, giant legos, connect four, four square, etc! The furniture was made of fake grass to help go with the out door theme. There was also arcade games and such inside with a live DJ and you could hear the music through speakers outside as well. DJ was AMAZING too! Not sure if he was their house DJ or just someone who happened to play there that night but he was WAY better than any house DJ the big name clubs have!  Also we saw this cute tiny home in the \"backyard\" labeled 'Sugar Shack' and it was a tiny home for rent via airbnb! They were hosting a group so we couldn't go check it out but I did find it on Airbnb later and it looks fantastic!  I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. It is indeed the adult playground, as they advertise it!!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places downtown. They have free entry and some times a line at the door. I love that I can go here and relax, or I can go and get drunk, or even just go and play games. They have so many options for activities and so much room. I actually didn't realize then had the outdoor area until my second time going there. As for some of there games.. they have connect four,  jenga, twister, giant beer bong, corn hole, and even some pool. Inside they also have a bunch of chairs, bean bags, and even a bed with pillows. my friend almost fell asleep on the bean bags, however security was quick to wake her up. To keep her up we played huge tic tac toe for like ever! Not sure how she could even sleep with a DJ playing!!! It's more a place to hang out and grab a drink then a place to dance but it still happens in little blasts. White girls trying to twerk!! YAY!! They also have a band that plays outside that gives out FREE BEER. It's free and it's beer, what more can you ask for. They have a couple bars, the one outside takes the longest it seems but they have $3 PBR and tiny cups. Super fun place that I recommend to start or even end your night at."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at Gold Spike last night for a friend's birthday party!  We had a table outside...our waitress was wonderful and the security team was very helpful and took great care of us :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in downtown mainly for the atmosphere! Whenever a friend of mine is visiting from out of town I take them here because there's plenty to do from the games such as the life-sized jenga & beer pong, cornhole and more. It's very common they throw events such as roller skate nights and pre-event parties before big festivals such as Life is Beautiful.  The drinks are moderately priced for Vegas standards. One mixed drink will run you about $8-12. They don't usually have deals which is meh but it's all reasonably priced nonetheless :) The bar food is the type you can expect from any bar-greasy, fatty and delicioso.  They never charged for cover the 10 times I've been there so that's a HUGE plus. Parking can be a bit annoying, good luck finding space on the tiny lot of theirs. You'll have better luck parking at the big structure across the street.   The music choice is pretty good with a variety of pop, top 50, classics and some edm.  Something about this place is very approachable and is a foolproof destination for any out-of-towners or firstcomers. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was just to get a quick bite after a late night of hanging out at the Gold Spike. I ordered the French Toast and was absolutely blown away!  It was a combination of perfect bread and very tasty cinnamon batter.   One of the best parts of this place is the prices. Most items are under $10 which is awesome because there is nothing I love more than a good value!  I had a burger which was OK, but the steak fries on the side were perfect. My last visit I re-ordered the French Toast and got two pancakes for $2 on the side. I was once again surprised with the size of them and how tasty they were. I asked our server what batter they used because I was blown away. For the price, I would much rather have a stack of these than at eat.   There is no doubt I will be back and no doubt that I will continue to crave their French Toast!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot until I was recently informed that they no longer except military IDs. \"What sense does that make?\" What happens to the out of town military that visit????Maybe I'm wrong, but someone needs to clarify the situation because that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Way to support troops if it is true however......that is a major slap to their faces. Come on gold spike you can do better than that."}
{"text":"Our group arrived to the front of the Gold Spike to find a short line at the door where you must show your ID...then, once you enter, wow, a fun place awaits for you and I ...you know...grown ups that are too old play on the playground without kids, but too energetic to stay home...fun grown ups.  This was my first time to Gold Spike...I was pleased that there was not an entrance fee, just a place to have some drinks with friends and have some fun like you might have had as a child on the playground...or with a friend at a slumber party having a pillow fight. We never managed to utilize the bed for the pillow fight, but our group got down with some 4 square, and corn hole. The playground was larger than I thought it would be, with lots of offerings, including beer pong, humongous chess, twister, tether ball, etc.  When my love and I went down with some friends on a Friday night, there was a live band playing. We were in a large party of over a dozen people, but just like playground fashion would have it, we ended up playing with strangers and making new friends...a fun and easy way to wind down after a week of work.  Gold Spike is right in the heart of downtown, and we found a mix of lots of tourists and locals when we came. GS is perfect for a large group, but even a small party could have a great time. Don't take my word for it though, come play and get your drink on for yourself!  - 2017 Review #29 -"}
{"text":"Had an alright time until their scumbag security started hitting on my wife. The individuals who they were congregating with loudly inquired if they \"hit that ass\" as we were leaving. My wife felt sexually harassed and I left feeling insulted and pissed off. Going to exchange words with management at my soonest convenience, as it seems that the security has caused a lot of trouble here before. They are scum and should be stripped of their jobs. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place to hang out with friends late at night. Came to Vegas for EDC and didn't know what to do so we came here from a recommendation and it was such a blast. Live music, drinks, human sized games, and dancing of course. It was just a good time and I recommend this for any age 21+! Make sure to stop by if you're in town. Defintely worth it."}
{"text":"Showed up to the Down and Derby event on 6/20/2018 and noticed that a skate rental was $10 and included a drink ticket for $10. I had no interest in drinking, so I requested to simply pay for a skate rental. I was told that no-can-do and given some spiel about insurance rates going up. Upon continuing to haggle, I was told to leave and threatened with physical assault by the venue staff. I attempted to advise them of the possible negative legal repercussions and they continued to talk over me and mock me stating that they \"deal with people like me on a regular basis\" (when saying \"people like me\", they must have meant to try to make fun of me for my disability). I saw myself out, and to make up for their trouble having to put up with me, I did them a service by pruning some dead branches off of a bush outside the gate. They then threatened again to physically assault me while also holding my arms together with handcuffs. 0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, fabulous service IF YOU ARE SERVED BY MARIA. If not the service is pretty lackluster and might just ruin your experience like it did mine today."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to spend a night out with your friends. What a genius idea! I had the best time EVER at Gold Spike...the concept is phenomenal and brings back great memories of college with all sorts of drinking games and activities. The live bands that play here are seriously the best bands in Vegas, too!  Adam is an incredible GM! My friends and I had such a great time because Adam goes above and beyond to make sure everyone's having fun. Definitely one of the hardest working professionals in Vegas...and you can tell he loves his job. Seriously impressed with this place!  If you want to go dancing, play some retro arcade games, skeeball, beer pong, giant Jenga, giant beer pong, cornhole, darts, and many other awesome games, this is the place!  Every city needs a Gold Spike, and every Gold Spike needs an Adam!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing,food was good .  would never guess how nice this place is from the outside. Very hip/Modern..on their outside patio they have lots of games from ping pong,large genga, corn hole, large chest, shuffleboard, garbage can size beer pong pool table etc.the service was great very friendly and attentive (Angelina)"}
{"text":"This cafe will be the reason why I come back to Gold Spike.  Everything from the smiley face salt and pepper shakers to the hot sauce wall stole my heart.  The food is delicious (ate the pancakes and french toast) and the service was friendly.  Being from the bay area, I am a huge fan of Peet's coffee.  I'm pretty sure this is one of the only venues in Vegas that serves Peet's.  The waitress was even kind enough to give me a to go cup of coffee after we were done with our meal.  If you're looking for an easy, but enjoyable restaurant to get a bite to eat, I highly recommend the Grill.  I am definitely a promoter and fan.  I'll be back for more brioche french toast soon."}
{"text":"Regardless if your Local or out for town, chief needlessly help you out. This place is the heart of down town las vegas for people who are looking for a good time."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere but the bartenders are kinda slow and the music is super broad.. it goes from pop to rap in a matter of songs"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food, with a twist. I liked that most items could be ordered as a wrap or sandwich. Fries were good. It wasn't crowded at all and the staff were super nice and fast"}
{"text":"Gold Spike really needs two listings. One for daytime activities and one for the nightlife. In the day, it's a blessing for anyone who telecommutes. Sometimes when you work from home you just need to get out before your house starts feeling like a jail cell. The free wifi (decent speeds), plenty of outlets and long tables around the bar allow you to spread out and really get some work done. JAIL BREAK! In some ways it still feels like my house though. TV's, good beer, solid tunes and super models. Fine, I made that last one up. Added bonus that cafe serves solid food on the cheap and delivers it to your table. Gold Spike FTW!  At night you can really make use of the outdoor area. They provide (more) cornhole sets, jumbo Jenga, another bar and often times a band rocking out by a Silver Bullet style trailer. Def worth a stop next time you're bar hopping downtown."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on a Sunday night around 10ish. The crowd was slow at first but little by little, clusters of people walked it. They have a buy one get a free drink special! Their house DJ played a variety a good/chill vibes music. It wasn't club music and had a good mix of old and new remixes! I would definitely come here again! We stayed at the Main Street hotel and the walk was not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Went to the Gold Spike for the first time this weekend and oh man! My new favorite place in Vegas!! It is like a playground for adults... Inside are games like connect 4, a dance floor and dj, but it was really happening outside...Tether ball, giant chess, giant corn hole, giant operation (but no buzzer), 4 square, shuffle board, live band, hooka lounge, and GIANT BEER PONG my mind was blown. $3 shots (and regular drinks were pretty stiff, not expensive I mean strong). We were there for hours, seriously fun and a crowd that is there to really have fun. Such a great idea. Love it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"L o v e this place. Great games, drinks arent too expensive, good food. Good atmosphere. Wish there was more than one bathroom but thats not a huge downfall."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place in all of downtown. Horrible music. Horrible bouncers. Horrible crowd. There are plenty of other great dance clubs and trendy bars in the area. Do not waste your time here! There is also a cover, which is ridiculous for the level of service you get. (Hint: the service is non-existent)"}
{"text":"This place is so mix fun. The food is great and the people here are a blast. The only negative is they don't have deserts. This place screams s'mores and twinkee's but all they have is fruit. Regardless... Amaze balls!"}
{"text":"This place can either be super chill or really hectic depending on the night you go. Saturday they had a live Hawaiian band playing in the outside area and it was really nice I actually enjoyed it a lot. But of course it was pack with stupid drunks everywhere. Literally got stepped on by three people by that time I was ready to go. This place is not what it used to be anymore. Thanks people for ruining it...k bye"}
{"text":"I was throughly impressed since the exterior says casino & I know this place is old... I was expecting a dumpy, dark, filthy casino. Ended up being one of the hottest night clubs I've seen. There's Giant connect four, Giant Jenga & 3 games of corn hole, Pool tables & fast service.  Went there to meet some friends at their going away party, they're moving. I really loved the atmosphere. I would go back again just to get out the house. I hate large crowds and it was a Friday night when we went last week. Loved how spacious it felt.  Music was really good, the DJ was fantastic also."}
{"text":"Gold Spike has been marked in my new places to hang out with friends! I've been here once before but it was only for a brief moment. This most recent trip I came with a group of my co-workers to grab a few drinks and hang out.  As soon as you walk in be prepared to show your ID! You little kitties that try to sneak in it's not happening lol. You MUST be 21 and up to enter! I think of this place as like an adult playground! How cool is it that after ordering drinks at the bar you can head out back to enjoy some supersized beer pong, life size chess and sandbag boards!  In addition to the great selections of games and good drinks, the music didn't disappoint one bit! The mini bar that they set up outside doesn't actually have everything like the full bar does inside so if you are a fan of Modelo you have to grab a few inside before heading outside to play.   There are just a few things that are critical to keep me coming back as a returning customer to any bar and that would be great service, music and food! I didn't personally order anything from the kitchen however my co-workers did and had several issues which cost them that 5th star.. I will return soon and hopefully have a better experience than what they did. Other than that, everything else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"An adult playground! We enjoy ourselves every time. No cover charge! Door guards are super cool. Beer isn't the cheapest here tho! Must try if you're in the area! You're like A drunk kid, can't go wrong lol! Beer pong, teatherball & more!"}
{"text":"So the night started out ok, as soon as the bar got slightly busy all went downhill. My party of 4 waited about 45 minutes to get water and close out our tabs. Not to mention the first bartender we asked to take care of us responded with a short \"I'm done\" and didn't even bother to tell another bartender to take care of us. Good intentions horrible service. And how could I forget the drunk belligerent who tried to fight my friend while the security was \"mingling\" with a employee. Obviously not a service minded establishment."}
{"text":"This is an okay bar. Has a ton of TVs which is great for sports games. Has a ton of games to play if you don't like sports. Has a U shaped bar on right hand side, lazy boys in the middle of the place and tables to the right. Very dark atmosphere so bring your reading glasses. Bartender worked alone so it took awhile to get drinks despite being 2pm on a Sunday. Has okay specials and lots of beer and liquor to choose from. Kinda dirty and reminds me of a strip club. Would I come back? Probably."}
{"text":"If you wanna have a good time, without getting all dressed up, or spending a bunch of money,  GoldSpike is your new spot.   It became me and my buddies' \"spot\" after one random visit there. It's like the owner of the old casino let his son redo the ground floor and the son was like \"let's make it a house party on steroids!\".   Space - tons of places to sit, stand, drink and move around.  Drinks - cheaper than most Vegas establishments.   Cafe - surprisingly good, tons of hot sauce options.   Customer Service - 10/10  Fun - you can play giant board games, cornhole, ping pong, regular size board games, sit on a bed, dance, shoot pool, kiss girls, it's a blast.   Location - a block north of Fremont: it's an easy walk from all the hotels downtown.   Crowd - young and hipstery, all cool people mostly locals.   This is a must visit hang out for locals and people staying downtown, trust me."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun, great concept of having interactive games to play. We played Jenga and had a beer pong match against some people and even played tether ball. All in all it was a good night/morning."}
{"text":"Let me first off say I am Las Vegas local and have been going to Gold Spike for over 2 years now. Within the past 3 experiences here have been horrible and discriminated. Every time I have people come visit or go out with other locals here I bring at least 10 or more at a time which is great business for you guys. With that being said your staff/ \"security\" are completely rude when it comes to getting into GOLD SPIKE. You guys are not Hakkasan, Drais, Omnia, etc.. ITS GOLDSPIKE!!! Every time I come here there is something/someone  always in my party that you guys have a problem with. We dress really nice and don't act drunk like girls that I have witnessed outside the line showing their breasts to your \"great friendly staff\" just to get them in, but want to discriminate against someone in my part because they wore a fitted plain white tee. We were willing to pay extra just to get in. Let me also add it was dead inside from what the other people party said. So fellow locals and yelpers go walk a block over to Commonwealth who hold up a better environment and to have a great time without being judged. I will make it known to everyone that I know to not go there anymore!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced with a good diner menu. We were there on a Saturday night around 9pm and it felt like we were there during a shift change. The waitress didn't greet us when we arrived and we sat for awhile before I walked up to the cash register to ask for menus.  I had the sliders on Hawaiian rolls and they were overcooked and dry. We also had a sandwich wrap at the table and that was decent.  I wouldn't recommend this place to be Wow'ed by the food. Service got better after we finally got our menus. I'd recommend this place as an alternative to a diner or casual restaurant in a casino. I like that it's open late and that it's not overpriced."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Downtown LV, make SURE you stop by here. The interior is huge and offers something to do for everyone. Lots of TVs and comfortable seating both inside and outside. What most impressed me was how large the back outdoor area was, where most of the life-size games were located. Even though they don't have any happy hour deals, I really enjoyed my cocktails.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Find Fred, the most honest laid back bar tender in the whole place, in his words \" tip doesn't matter what you feel is right\" I love gold spike I come here when I travel to Vegas from the bay area,  tonight was my first time at gold spike with Freddy being my bar tender and it was honestly the most chill experience."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out - the food is good and always great people to meet up with!"}
{"text":"Had such a blast here, it's basically a playground for adults! Was visiting Vegas from Washington, DC. I had John H and Songi as my bartenders. They were amazing and made me feel right at home. When you go ask for them!! I'm going to tell everyone this is a must when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun! Where adults can be a kid again. Giant Jenga, Twister, Chess, etc. Never played any of them but we really enjoyed watching others play & we just set up right next to a fire pit. Service was good but could have been better. Waitress was not that attentive. We rented a hookah set for $30. That was a blast. Pineapple & Strawberry Daq! The lady renting out the sets was very sweet. Loved being outdoors. The weather was perfect. Would definitely go back. The band playing was jamming all of the early 2000's rock/alternative hits. Was fun to sing along. Didn't catch much of the inside scene but saw the crowd dancing to a DJ & bathrooms were clean. Drinks were reasonably priced. The only other downside was parking & that they made my husband pay a cover charge just for going outside to add more time to our car. If you're staying downtown, WALK!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and I finally made it here lol. such a fun place! You will never get bored. Games, booze and friends...all winners in my book. Games are super sized too!  After playing bunch of games and drinking. They have a cafe serving some bomb ass food. especially, for bar food...it's exceptional.   Go to gold spike, Take a night off from the real world and being grown. 4 stars-"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, Mike was our bartender. The food/menu needs to be worked on. Ordered the Chicago Hotdog and it fell apart, the hotdog was too large for the bun, messy, the bun should be toasted so that all the juices from the pickles peppers etc don't make it soggy. The hotdog by itself with the pickles and peppers tasted good. We will come back but won't order that again."}
{"text":"Best of times every time when I'm at gold spike.  Food was awesome and the new shakes are fire!!! Will see every weekend till I move from Vegas."}
{"text":"I attempted to go here on a Friday night because a friend said it would be fun. Myself and two friends walked up around 10pm. The doorman was super rude and told us we had to go. The reason being because I stepped over the rope on the side of the building where a line would be. Keep in mind there is no line and its 10pm!! Me and my friends are all mid 20's, attractive and slim so it wasn't an appearance thing. It was all because the doorman had an attitude. I have never ever been treated with such disrespect nor turned away from any bar or night club. I strongly recommend taking your business elsewhere unless you are willing to deal with the nazi doorman."}
{"text":"Chief was a chill guy at the line. He was entertaining with a wide variety of guests."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Giant Jenga is a blast and I always love when Hard Candy plays live! There are outdoor and indoor games too. This is definitely one of the more up & coming hot spots on Fremont, especially for locals. Not just a sit down and talk bar, very interactive and you feel like a kid again with all of the backyard games. I love all of the remodeling the have done. Can't wait to see how this place progresses this year!"}
{"text":"I went to Gold Spike several times with friends and had a good time every time.   First, this place is located downtown Vegas, which means that parking may be a little challenging depending on the night but that there is also a lot of activity around it, particularly with Fremont Street so close.  I never paid a cover to get in, but you will be searched for security reasons. Gold Spike is much more of a \"locals\" hanging out spot than what you would typically find on the Strip and there is no specific dress code to get in. One of the best thing about this place are all the games you can play for free once inside.  Another good thing about this place is that they offer free drinks on certain nights, but expect to wait quite a long time for them even on nights when you do have to pay. Bar food was pretty good every time I ordered some.  In conclusion, I would say that this is a pretty good place to hang out. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  I never have a problem with my food, totally consistent.  Even had a friend who can't have anything gluten, she did the grilled veggies, but had to ask about the vinegrette.  The server and chef were kind enough to check it out!!  Great service, awesome food!  The hot dogs are huge and flavorful, fries to die for, cheesecake i'm in love with.  Can't go wrong with this place!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend wanted to go out for drinks on a Monday night to celebrate her bday. We both work at Dayclubs and Nightclubs, so we wanted something low key. My BFF never really goes out much bc she works so much, so I wanted to make a special surprise out it. After having some trouble getting in contact with the venue online, I managed to find an email & received a text response immediate. The response came from John Watkins. After telling him my plan, we coordinated to use the LITTLE HOUSE located in the back area. He followed up with my throughout the day of the event to make sure we were still planning for our 11pm surprise. I arrived with cupcakes, bday banner, and confetti poppers. Once inside Gold Spike, John greeted me and walked me over to the adorable little house and went above and beyond to help me decorate, and plan for the surprise. He must have noticed that I was stressed and starved, bc he sent over some bomb nachos as I wanted for the bday girl to arrive. She arrive and the surprise was hilarious, and everything went as planned. John checked on us multiple times throughout the evening, and invited us back for some industry related events. I will definitely be back to show support, and was impressed with how much John and our little house Server Bernadette made every effort to make out night memorable."}
{"text":"Gold Spike isn't what it used to be. Downtown Project totally gutted the old downtown casino and transformed it into a hipster magnet. The slot machines, tables, everything is gone. In its place is now a chill hang out spot complete with cheap drinks, good food and plenty of entertainment.  The lounge areas is what makes a visit to the Spike worth it. Huge bean bag chairs and comfy couches surround \"board\" games spread throughout the property. Giant versions of Connect 4, and Jenga is what everyone raves about. Overall great atmosphere, total 180 of the old smokey casino that Gold Spike used to be. Be warned though: more and more people are finding out about GS and its geting packed weekend evenings."}
{"text":"I really have enjoyed the times I have stopped by GS. I love all the games they have and the photo booth. Stopped by today 8/7/15 and was very happy they had a cider on tap. I'm hoping they bring in more ciders like a pineapple cider. The bartenders and the security guards were very friendly and professional. I would give GS 5 stars however I don't like that they charge locals to get in on the weekends so that's -1star. Whenever I have friends and family visit and I really want to bring them here but I rather pass and go to a different bar where I don't have to pay to get in. Over all this is a fun place with great service. I'll definitely be coming back some time in the future during the week. But definitely not the weekend. Hopefully they stop charging locals an enterance fee so I can come in during the weekend and spend my money on drinks and not on an enterance fee."}
{"text":"Ann Marie (cocktail waitress) went about and beyond  we all had such a good time we are definitely going back on her shift !!"}
{"text":"Honestly I haven't gave one bad review on yelp. I'm not a bad review kind of person. Especially because I loved Gold Spike. I mean it's a grown up that's a big kid at hearts Dream. But I just went through my statement from March and I have a $21 dollar tab which was correct but it said I tipped $26! Wtf! I'm a bartender and I do tip well. But not over 100% unless I was getting free drinks. I recall ordering only 2 Jameson and coke and 1 Guinness and not getting any free drinks. I definitely wasn't drunk and definitely didn't forget. On a $21 dollar tab for 3 drinks I usually tip any where from $6-$10 normally not $26. So if I wasn't going thru my bank statements I would have never know. I would definitely suggest if you go to this establishment pay with cash. If not some greedy bartender that thinks your drunk might add his own tip!!! Jerk guy bartender!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Gold Spike just to drink a few beers and hang out for a few hours.  First of all, the beer selection was not very good and was expensive at about $7/bottle.  Anyways I bought the beer and went to go play some darts with my friend.  Only one board was worthy of playing (it was being used); the other had severe water damage and was jutting out of the wall.  So we then decided to paly some pool.  The cues weren't great, but were manageable, so we played a few games.  They also had cornhole in the bar.  The place could definitely be cool if the vibe/night was right, but I was there at 9pm on a friday and it was dead so maybe I need to go back another weekend later to experience the true Gold Spike."}
{"text":"Very cool! First time going last nite & played some connect four on the wall, played some jenga & operation outside... oh! & try a boozy capn crunch milkshake from fiddlestix! So tasty! I was worried it would taste too much like alcohol but nope, it blended right in. Interesting ppl watching too."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. They have awesome games but be sure to go on a night where there isn't an event in town or you have to wait in lines to play. The drinks are suuuuper small, like tiny plastic cup small BUT (my bartender, at least) made it VERY strong. It cost me $7.50 for a Vodka cranberry, which, for the area, is a pretty good deal considering how much alcohol was in it. Overall, this bar is a must try if you're looking for a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bottom line.... off you want to have a good time... this is definitely the place you  want to be!!! Prices are not bad for a downtown bar and the life size games are definitely a must have!!   I would definitely recommend everybody to go here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great adult playground I would suggest going a little early so you have a chance to play all of the games without it being too crowded they have life size cornhole ,chess, shuffleboard, Jenga and beer pong a little later in the night they have a DJ and outside they usually have a live band all in all it's a pretty cool spot to hang out downtown oh and don't forget the FourSquare and ping pong"}
{"text":"Gold spike was super chill. The trash can version of beer pong is dope. They have a tether ball pole which my friends enjoyed. Corn hole was fun too. Inside bar and dance floor also outside bar and dance floor. I would recommend as a must see. I met a lot of cool locals. I had a blast. Maybe because I was blasted but nonetheless it was dope."}
{"text":"Bouncers with power trips hitting men and women. Who's drunk here and who's sober..? Talk to the manager and he supports his staff... No excuses in my world.  Don't support this bar."}
{"text":"Finally a place that celebrates my love of board games! I love everything about this place... service at the main bar leaves something to be desired... S.L.O.W., but the work around on that is to just go to another bar. (Bar near security/DJ Booth isn't full service, but very quick)  This place has so much fun stuff!!! Shuffleboard (although I'm sad they took out the standing bar shuffleboard game. I haven't tried playing the floor version, but it looks fun. Life size Jenga, Large and small Bean bag toss games (cornhole), Life size beer pong.. Seriously giant \"red solo cups\" fashioned from large trash cans filled with water, using basketballs to make points. Awesome!  You can check out board games and there's tons of room (couches and chairs) to grab some friends and sit around and play.   There's was a live band playing outside last Saturday. This place has such a fun vibe. I didn't really get the the 3D room, but I don't think I'm the target demo for that kind of thing.   There's also an in house cafe. Decent food for decent prices.  Gold Spike, you are definitely becoming one of my favorite downtown spots!!"}
{"text":"Telly at Gold Spike was beyond amazing at serving my friends and I. I accidentally spilled my drink and I felt so bad but she was so sweet and made sure I didn't clean it up myself! She was the best!!!  Thank you Telly!!!"}
{"text":"This just may be one of the coolest bars I've been to here in Vegas.  If you're not feeling like taking your friends to a dive bar and having a night full of deep meaningful conversations, take 'em to Gold Spike. GS boasts a burger restaurant inside, jenga game which is as tall as myself, giant and regular sized connect four, pool tables, dart boards, shuffle boards, cornhole, giant sized beer pong, a synthetic ice rink, table shuffleboard, and a photo booth.  Along with all of these awesome bar games, GS has a decent beer list with several good brews on tap including one of my personal favs from Brooklyn Brewery. The beers are reasonably priced from a Freemont standpoint and even on a busy night the bartenders are on their game and serving them fast.  On my last visit I came with a friend who specifically wanted to partake in a cornhole tournament they were putting on that he read about in one of the local magazines. Upon calling GS to ask if the tournament was still on, he was met with the puzzled voice of one of the bartenders who had to go ask management about it. The bartender confirmed the tournament was on, so we jetted down there. $20 for a team of two gets you in and on their playoff bracket. There were eight teams competing that night and we admirably did our best and got knocked out of the first round. Afterwards we tried some of the other games around us and pretty much had a blast the entire evening. One drawback we unfortunately discovered  was the fact that there were only 5 cheap plastic darts in the bar which I suppose were supposed to be split between two dartboards, but we made do anyway."}
{"text":"What an awesome outdoor adult playground.  Spacious and lots of places to sit down at and have a drink.    Came here a few times and the outdoor games were fun.  Jenga, Beer Pong (with trash cans) and a pool table but with bowling balls.    Whenever I'm in town and hanging out with a lot of friends, this is the place to go.  Unfortunately, one visit a group of 15 of us were denied access because 2 of our guys had football jersey's so men make sure you do not wear sports attire."}
{"text":"Won't let you in if you are wearing joggers even though it is not listed on the dress code sign and there were at least three people inside that were wearing joggers or adidas track pants..so it's basically a case by case basis."}
{"text":"They treat their locals like crap I used to love coming here until the staff changed especially the bouncers they're the rudest most stupid people I've ever met I'm going to Oddfellows"}
{"text":"Had a blast with my dad, brother, and friend. This is my first time to Vegas and since I'm not a gambler I wasn't sure if I'd have fun. I'm glad I was wrong and I'll definitely be back again. Live music, friendly people, giant games and an awesome staff."}
{"text":"Angie is the best. We feel like family every time we come. The food is excellent and the service exceptional."}
{"text":"So I probably should be giving this place 4 stars bc of the drink prices being a little higher than other bars on Fremont. But its uniqueness is making it a 5 star to me. Some of the coolest things you'll find at a bar I garentee. Outside has such cool games and atmosphere and inside as well! Not your average bar games! They have corn hole (bean bag toss) giant beds, and many more as you've seen in the pics. It's a fun place to go with a group of people. Or if your not shy you can maybe jump in a giant bowling game or something! Please visit this cool spot when you visit Fremont it's a really cool bar to see!"}
{"text":"I think it's a cool place. The only problem is they need more organization. Why isn't there a sign up sheet for most of the games? It's a really cool concept, but there cheapest pitcher of beer is an $18 pitcher of PBR. REALLLLLLY??? The type of place they have should have $2 PBR's. I'm sure this would draw the hipster cliente they are striving to have. Overall, cool place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I came here tonight for the first time for the Down and Derby roller skating event. Apparently they have free roller skating the first and third Wednesday of each month.   The place is pretty big with various activities depending on your interests. Inside, there's a dance floor and giant couches/beds, pool tables, and other giant games. Outside, there's also a giant jenga set and tables to sit at.  The restrooms are pretty cool, too. There's tons of products at your disposal - lotion, hair spray, mouth wash, etc. - so you can touch up after dancing/skating/whatever activity.   People seem pretty fun, too. I can't wait to go back!  Update: I am taking off one star because they charge a $10 cover on Fridays and Saturdays, even if you only planned on going to Fiddlestix to eat. That doesn't really make sense to me. Ladies are free, but men need to pay, which is unfair if you're with your SO. That seems pretty high for a cover, especially for somewhere off the strip."}
{"text":"So much to do inside with many options to drink. The cover charge on the weekend sucks, it it helps with crowd control. A fun place to take people from out town."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars but I have to give something so I guess one will do! Let me start by saying I'm a local along with my group of friends and I have brought gold spike so much business! Last night my boyfriend was told he couldn't come in because he had a plain white tee on, mind you I was already inside and it was dead in there. This isn't freakin Drais or Hakkasaan like you would think that they would want people there and he was willing to pay 10 to get in but to hell with that. The security guards were rude as can be and think they are high and mighty because they have a say so in who goes in and out. I'm going to do my damnedest to ensure I let other locals know how much gold spike and their employees lack manners. Oh and for the record Commonwealth let him in and it was a better crowd with extremely nice security who valued our business. And the DJ played way better music, so fellow yelpers I say walk one block over and go to an establishment that is overall worth every penny"}
{"text":"Wow ok. I never yelp that much but I have to. I was at Gold Spike the other day and got a drink from this bartender named Bitty. She was amazing. Fast, nice, an the drink was spot on. I kept coming back to her cause the serves was the same each time. Also her being hot didn't hurt haha. I recommend going to Gold Spike cause it was a kick as time, but if not for that just to meet Bitty. She's pretty amazing.  I'm sure going to become a regular there now."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience at their bar, which was pleasant. They have a lovely selection which includes radlers, and that always makes me happy.  Of course I generally do like the bars in downtown a as they are not on the strip. I am sure to return."}
{"text":"Awesome now that it's been redone, giant connect four, Jenga, good beer, and live music...great place to hangout and have a drink without the crowd of the other downtown bars on first Friday"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, people watch and get some drinks with friends. Outdoor space with lots of games, jjanga, chess, twister, corn hole, shuffleboard, among others."}
{"text":"I usually have a great time here! They have giant lawn games, legos, Cards Against Humanity, and various other things. The drinks are a bit overpriced sometimes, but they are usually well made. Security seems to be pretty good here, they helped a friend and I when we were being harassed by some intoxicated male patrons.  They need to fix their giant jenga, too easy to get splinters!"}
{"text":"Surprise! This is not the dingy, dark, smokey, depressing, outdated Vegas bar you might expect from it's basic facade. They've spruced the place up with quasi-classy lounge furniture, and GIANT versions of cornhole, darts, and foosball. Sticking with the larger-than-life theme, they've got huge bean bag chairs, an outdoor lounge area, even a bed to chill in. While I personally don't love hanging out in bars during the day, Gold Spike was an okay compromise because they offer something other than drinking to pass the time.   The place is somewhat of a complex, with a bar and cafeteria-style restaurant inside (which features an entire wall of hot sauces... like 100 varieties... random cool gimmick!) If you need a little A/C and a cheap drink, Gold Spike is a surprisingly nice place to get the job done (though, still lacking the sunlight that all Vegas bars shun)."}
{"text":"Fun on wayyyyy to many levels . They have a life size Jenga and chess . The food is cool. But the ambiance is what I love ."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual spot.  Fun games, good atmosphere. The chicken fingers are to die for. Though I think they should add bloody Mary's to the menu.  I like how they have inside and outside, so you can linger around to both."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced drinks and lots to do with groups of friends. Down-side to all of that is it's hard to get groups of drunk people to \"share\" or take turns on the games. Just gotta be friendly and hope for the best! I always run in to at least 2 people I know down here. For me: it's my kind of fun.... I would rather be here than at any casino. It's a go-to for us."}
{"text":"Torn. Like the place but what the hell is the smell in here. First time I came I thought it was a wet mop. Now.. same smell. Gag! Leaving after my alcohol shake."}
{"text":"I love to go to Gold Spike for a more chill yet still unique night... the last time I went, there was an art display going on with people painting and displaying canvases and bodies lol. The coolest thing to me about goldspike is the atmosphere. Inside, there is a bar surrounded by tables with outlets and couches on the periphery. There is an outside area with plenty of standing room, fire pits surrounded by grass couches two lounge and enjoy a beer, human sized beer pong, giant Jenga, and a large Life is Beautiful sign. There is also an outside bar and a stage for live music, which is usually bumping. The drinks are good as well, and on the night I went, they had free champagne for ladies. Gold Spike is one of my favorite places to visit in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It was our last day in town and I found this amazing place while looking for a dancing type bar on yelp. It had a very roomy dance floor. The place was pretty dimmed and intimate as there were also booths with curtains a little ways away from the dance floor. There's a lot of entertainment like pool, giant connect 4, and my favorite was giant beer pong! Lastly their shots were buy one get one free for some reason so we got 4 shots of crown for $17"}
{"text":"Since they have removed gambling and made this more of a bar it is MUCH nicer. I haven't been on a weekend, but the remodel is very much worth the extra price and non smokey seedy gambler's that used to be here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, especially  on a hot summer night. Place to chill with friends and very affordable"}
{"text":"Service a little on the slower (and understaffed) side, but other than that, I am a fan. Great spot to unwind after a day with great happy hour specials and decent food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not local but my cousins are and took me here instead of the strip. I doubted it but I'm glad we came! Got bottle service for a fcking AMAZING price and deal. Great vibes and nothing but good vibes and good people. Kyrra is the cocktail server that's been taking care of my family. And yet again she hooked it up with EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE. If you're gonna come here request for KYRRA!!! You will NOT be disappointed. I PROMISE! Super professional, nice and genuinely a good person! Even the bouncers are AMAZING!!! Blue and Joe are good people! Constantly checked on my group to make sure we were doing well. The environment and those three workers made us feel like family! THANK YOU GOLD SPIKE, THANK YOU KYRRA, AND THANK YOU BLUE AND JOE FOR A DAMN GREAT NIGHT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I had to sum up this place in one word: Random.   I came here for the first time on a Friday night. It was a good mix of young and middle-aged, locals and non-locals. There is so much going on here. You go in, get a drink from the bar, and partake in whatever floats your boat.  There's live music going on in the backyard, along with some games like life-sized beer pong, corn hole, life-sized Jenga, etc. Inside you'll find a foosball table, pool, darts, shuffleboard, connect four and many other games that I may have missed.  Boytoy was right when he said this place is like an adult daycare."}
{"text":"late night spot to have fun in the DT area. but the service detracted from the fun.   pros: - fun: pool tables, bean bag toss, etc. the mood was definitely very festive and fun - roomy: plenty of space to spread out and lounge. lounge chairs and tables. i liked the furniture - very mixed crowd - plenty of parties - birthdays, bachelorettes, etc - no cover! at least i don't remember there being cover  cons: - almost put glass in my eye. no, seriously. i was waiting for a drink at the bar, and one of the bartenders was way too rough with the dirty glasses, a glass exploded and shards of glass flew out. a few pieces flew towards my friend and i, and one hit very very close to my eye. the further disappointment? the manager (it seemed like he was the manager) was right there when it happened. he asked me if i was okay, and that was it. he didn't really check further than that, and he made no offer to compensate OR APOLOGIZE. the bartender who actually broke the glass DID step up to the plate and did try to make us our drinks ASAP, but that was it. is this the type of service i should expect from any bar??? i don't care, i've been to some hole in the wall dive bars, but this was beyond ridiculous.  - who do i need to bang to get a drink???? my friend and i must have waited for a bartender to notice us for nearly 30 mins at the bar. if glass hadn't flown towards my face, i think i would have had to wait another 20 mins for a bartender to even notice us. it was total chaos at the bar! if i wanted to wait this long for a drink, i would have just walked to the nearest liquor store, had a few swigs, and STILL been waiting for a  bartender to get us our drinks.  - bathrooms were a mess. i'll admit it, drunk girls are slobs. this was pretty nasty. and with only a handful of stalls, OF COURSE, there was a line.   would i come again? no."}
{"text":"I think the Gold Spike is uber swank, I like it here. It reminds me of the Bay Area. Had a private tour of the room renovations and an explanation of the \"vision\" for downtown. Wait and see I say, Vegas is reinventing herself every chance she gets. The crowd here is business/professional/casual/hip at least it has been every time I have been in. Again, reminds me of the Bay."}
{"text":"Wow.. Despite the nipply chill of Vegas winter, this bar was so fun I actually stood outside and played giant beer pong, corn hole, and laid on a fluffy grass couch. I wish they had giant tether ball, I'd have died and gone to heaven. Loved the crowd, the bartenders, heat lamps, the giant bed inside the bar.. I loved everything! Definitely recommend coming here if you want to venture off the strip and have some real fun!"}
{"text":"For a no cover entrance, badass DJ, Love the outdoor games, pool tables, hella good vibes. For sure recommend for Friday or Saturday late night outing."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A place where you can hang out grab a beer and not smell secondhand and hear about hitting a royal!  AND ITS DOWNTOWN!  Amazing atmosphere of games and lounging that you wish your backyard and treehouse looked like when you were growing up!  Drink prices are reasonable for downtown and the cafe has a surprisingly fresh menu!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of this place, a cool and trendy place to hang out with people from out of town, drinks are a little pricey if you order the wrong things. But the beers are very well priced, the spirits are a little bit pricy. I can really go here once a month. But when i do go its a fun time. The bands that play are different but enjoyable"}
{"text":"Since its reopening, I has been nothing short of disappointing. Doucheville USA. Nothing like vacuous hipsters! Gone are the days of old Vegas. Like thanks mr zappos, like, seriously, omg! I'll be at the huntridge tavern."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick breakfast while driving through Vegas. The lounge area and restaurant are modern and chic.  We got the breakfast burrito and a pancake. The pancake was delicious and fluffy. The breakfast burrito was simple and hit the spot! Not only was the food great, but the service was excellent. Morgan and Angelina did an amazing job taking care of us.   After breakfast, we walked to the back and realized there is a whole backward area. Tables for beer pong, benches, music, a little house you can rent for parties. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food is average. It's nothing to brag about, I had the chicken wrap and fries, the people are nice but need to step up their game being servers."}
{"text":"I always have a blast when I am here with my friends. 4 square, pool, beer pong (table and bigger version) are a MUST! Good music during weekends, random dodgeball tournaments ! Upbeat environment, great place to meet new people; I suggest pregaming before you go in, as drinks can be pricey. You can find $3 beers in DTLV."}
{"text":"I patronized this place after a year of reprieve. I was disappointed in the changes and service. We had a table with a cocktail  waitress who never showed up. After hunting her down and giving $40 for a 60 bill, she pocketed the cash charged the full amount on the 1 cc given. When questioned she acted like She had no idea of her mistake. The male manager was cocky and unprepared for a professional encounter. Did the owner hire his neighbor??? Locals, don't come here... It's not the same"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Saturday night and loved it! Great live music and spacious venue!"}
{"text":"This is seriously my favorite bar in Las Vegas.  I have been going there on a regular basis for about 3.5 years.  It is located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas.  You can eat, drink and even stay the night! There is a dj inside wednesday- Sunday and live bands in the backyard.  Goldspike is my home away from home.  The management staff is always their to help with any problem you may have with a smile on their face.  The bartenders are awesome and treat their regulars well. The security always remembers me and makes me feel really safe.  I know they have my back!  You can choose from a wide array of games to play.  It has the vibe of a club/house party."}
{"text":"Wow Tater! One of the best mixologist down town!! If you're down town you have to stop by,  you won't be disappointed! Perfect Atmosphere, great food and service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars.  It has the making of a new epic downtown hangout.    The prices are good in the restaurant and at the bar.  But service is slow and not very professional.  My drink was so strong that I could barely drink it.  But two rounds of drinks and beers rang in at. 37$ and our dinner was 19.98 for two so maybe that's the trade off.   The atmosphere is pretty great,  indoor/outdoor games  both large size and regular size which you can check our for FREE just use your licence to hold the game.    We played corn hole,  life size beer pong and Jenga love that there is finally a place to hang out and you don't have to gamble.  There is no gambling licence here.  All games are free.   My biggest complaint besides service is that it's not maintained well at all,  I feel like this Palace in the next year is going to be a dive. It's very unfortunate as so much money went into the building and the potential is amazing but if someone doesn't come in a clean up its going to need a new remodel ASAP.  The women's bathrooms could already use it,  the out door patio heaters,  trim, booth seats in the restaurant and general cleanliness.  The downtown grand next. Door is a great. Example of a quality simple reno and they maintain the quality.   We will go back,  we did have a great time with great. Company. We did like that we could just hang out and it wasn't a club.  The indoor and outdoor options are awesome.  Fire pits out side and a mini \"ice rink\"  skating is, 10$ I would not bother.  The idea is great but synthetic ice does not make for a very smooth or graceful skate.   Parking is limited but there is free valet next. Door at Downtown Grand.    Go have fun."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! I truly cannot get enough of it. You can find me here multiple times per week! I love what the Downtown Project has done to the interior, making if feel like a swanky lounge, yet it also feels like you could kick back and relax. There are a wide variety of games and activities to be enjoyed inside in addition to the full bar.   The grill is cool, too - they have a veggie sandwich that is absolutely delightful with fresh flavors that truly pop. A MUST TRY is the Stigl on tap. It's a grapefruit beer that really tastes like a grapefruit soda - it's perfect for the summertime, yet a little pricey at $9 each.   The outside area is also a treat with giant beer pong, man-sized jenga and a gigantic cornhole set - it's a blast to hang out next to the airstream and listen to a sweet bluegrass band jam.   Man, I love the 'Spike."}
{"text":"Awesome place, trendy, cool, quite, great food, over 100 hot sauces, great music, tvs, darts, free wifi, and all for a very good price."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but they charge way too much for drinks. It looks swanky and cool, and definitely has a bay area feel to it as some other reviewers have said. But this isn't the bay. This is Vegas. And as a Vegas local, I don't expect to pay $8 for a beer unless I'm getting a lap dance with it. As I nursed the single beer I ordered, another pair came in and was shocked to be charged $20 for a round... so I know I\"m not the only one who experienced sticker shock. The bartender seemed like she was very used to people being turned off by the price of drinks.  The whole place came off as pretentious. It would be awesome if their prices were reasonable, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. There's too many options here in Vegas and this place is a bit of a ripoff. It's a shame because it really had potential to be great."}
{"text":"We stopped by during the day and had a hard time figuring out where the entrance was since it's labeled as Fiddlesticks but a few of the cooks were standing outside and helped confirm we were in the right place.  Fun place to come with a large group or for an office party.  Plenty of great back drops with photo ops.  They had me at the life size jenga!!  Life is beautiful."}
{"text":"I came here a few weekends ago on a Sunday afternoon with friends at the end of our Vegas trip. It was a great spot to round out our weekend stay. We had lunch and we were all satisfied with the food. I had a burger and fries and I ate every bite. The staff was pretty friendly. They have couches and I felt like a queen laying there. Since we went in the afternoon it wasn't hopping with a bunch of people but that's alright, we had our own fun. We played cornhole, giant jenga and life size beer pong. It was a pretty laid back spot. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bar tenders started the adventure off with good spirits and laughs, followed up with indoor and outdoor activities made for an awesome afternoon. Good spot to spend a few hours not gambling and enjoying friends."}
{"text":"No more shuffle board.. such a disappointment. They added more seating area which is cool but shuffleboard is AWESOME! no more bean bags.. maybe the drunkies just spilled too much on them . GRR.  Its a cool hang out. Non-smoking inside which is a nice change from most places in Vegas. Plenty of games to check out. Drinks a bit over priced. Good food in the cafe.  Its a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking fun I mean they have beer pong that is the size of real garbage cans they have chess is the size of a human being they have a JENGA that is the size of a human being they play the best music ever that you need to have your Shazam Application out at all times and the drinks are and the service is pretty spot on so fun so amazing right in downtown Las Vegas...not to mention underneath every single bar pub stool you can charge your phone or multimedia device!!!   JACKPOT!  Plus it's SMOKE FREE!!!!"}
{"text":"Came for the adult sized games at the Gold Spike but stayed for the most charismatic, professional, and fun cocktail waitress from Cleveland, Annemarie! If you come here ask for her, she is awesome sauce and she'll remember all your drinks!"}
{"text":"I had an appointment this morning and decided to go somewhere for breakfast after.  A bit of searching on Yelp helped me decide to go with the Gold Spike Grill.  I've been reading about the changes here since it was purchased by the Downtown Project.  Wow, what a nice place!  What a nice surprise!!  The place is small so I didn't have to search to find the Grill.  It's a bright, almost all white area on the east side of the building.  I opted to sit at the counter.  As I walked through the lobby area, I noticed all the people with their laptops and I soon checked my iPhone for wifi.  Free, fast wifi!  Yes!  The menu isn't very large for breakfast but it's certainly adequate.  As I was looking at the menu, my server, Brittany, brought me coffee and a glass of ice water.  I ordered their 3 egg omelette with any three ingredients you choose from their list.  I got spinach, jalapeño, and cheese.  The omelette comes with hash browns and toast of your choice.  As I was enjoying the wifi and taking photos of the Grill, I noticed the hot sauces that were on the counter.  They have a whole bunch of kinds most of which I've never heard of before.    When my omelette arrived, I chose to put some \"Scorned Woman\" hot sauce on part of it.  The bottle had a heat level of 8 on it.  I don't know who judges the heat of a hot sauce, but 8 was a bit too high.  But, it was hot and it was a good addition to the omelette.  Service was good and sitting at the counter, one of the cooks looked out after I was eating for awhile and asked how breakfast was.  When I gave him thumbs up, he had a big smile and went back to his work!  This was something I noted from everyone at the Gold Spike.  People had smiles, they were very pleasant, and they were welcoming!  When I left, I spent some time in the \"back yard\" which would be a great place to bring a drink or sit and spend some time chatting with friends.  There's also an area behind a fence where you can eat outdoors.  Parking is very convenient and free.  Enter from 4th Street between Ogden and Stewart as you head north on 4th.  While the breakfast was nothing exotic, it gets all 5 stars.  This is as good as breakfast gets and the staff is so very pleasant.  Throw in the wifi and you have a great spot!"}
{"text":"Super fun! Drinks were bogo free until midnight and they had a lot of fun games 59 play. Pool, 4 square, twister, giant jenga, a HUGE life size beer pong. Fun people. Staff was polite! Definitely fun and right off of Fremont. I think there was food too but I didn't try anything."}
{"text":"So I went here last night with my friend, and  it was great! The line wasn't long and not to mention it was free to get in. This place is very diverse which I loved. It's very spacious and it also has an outside area as well. They also have an area outside with beer pong, hookah and some other activities.The only negative thing is it gets really hot inside which sucks but I'll definitely visit this place whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"No gaming. No smoking. No trace of Vegas left in it. As usual, Downtown Project took a neighborhood staple and ruined it with Tony's San Francisco vision.  We were here on the last night it was a casino, and were disgusted by the flock of Zapponians, all dressed exactly the same (like a cult), playing bad wedding music on the jukebox and having a grand old time celebrating the fact that their Dear Leader was about to put a bunch of people out of a job.  More recently, I literally spent a half-hour attempting to track down ANYONE who wanted to take my money for the Diet Coke I ordered. A person who values their time would've just walked out (It's 4 cents worth of syrup, for christ's sake), but they've got prominent security everywhere, presumably to keep the old regulars and other characters from the neighborhood out. We can't have any of those scum in Tony's New Downtown, can we?  For a place backed by a company with an outspoken devotion to \"Service,\" the service here is really atrocious.  Unfortunately, despite all of its flaws, and the fact that I'm basically supporting the Evil Empire destroying downtown by going there, I will probably be back when I get sick of working in my windowless office in The Ogden. I'll definitely sit at the bar next time, lest they forget about me...again."}
{"text":"3am'ish, nobody to seat us. A few more minutes we are still standing at the wait to be seated sign. Still time passes. Our friend waves down a server, he then points to a just bussed table that has not been reset. It shall remain that way as I still have a fresh set of utensils from the last table. We are seated for nearly 15min until we receive menus. No drink orders taken. More time passes, then more time. Then more. Then our friend gets up walks to the service counter and flags the guy down to take our order. Waters & food, plus an apology saying it is someone else's section... where is the manager to coordinate the floor? Then we wait and wait and wait. Waters come 10 minutes later than the food comes all at once. Typical bar fare finger food. Burger fries quesadillas etc. Nothing to rave about, but the quacamole extra was spoiled. Chef argued with me. He claimed it was a fresh premade bag that was dated and he just opened. Spoiled tastes as spoiled will taste. Here is the end of the argument, I tasted it before he. He deemed it good before I did without a lick to his lips. Apparently his attitude is that labels on boxes and premade product stays good until opened without any check prior to serving it to guests. Then after this situation of telling me I was wrong he throws up a fresh avocado and says he will make the same batch fresh. Indeed fresh and a completely different product, but I could have done without the throwing it in my face attitude. The server pulled no strings nor did anything to placate the situation, basically we were soiled with sporadic and occasional service and a chef who could only read labels and was at best a by the numbers cook who was in dire need of supervision along w his front of the house cohorts."}
{"text":"I've never felt as violated or as victimized as I have here.  This is a place that claims to care about locals but flushes them down the toilet as soon as they can. I've never felt as much like trash as I have since I've been here. Stay away. If I could post zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Definitley a 1 star for this joke of a place.  We wanted to play big beer pong and when we went to the bartender and told her the same thing she game us a pitcher with ping pong balls.  I told her that i would go ahead and pay for it since she made it but i would rather play big beer pong.  She told me it was ok and to hold on for a bit. I waited for 10 minutes and was surrounded by 4 bouncers telling me i was \"kicked out for life\" because I wasted a pitcher of beer.  Ive had a few other friends who have had issues with the bartenders/bouncers at this place.  Definitley dont go if you're ever in Vegas"}
{"text":"Bouncers were very disrespectful told me I was standing around like an idiot while I was trying to put my ID back which only took me a minute UGH worst place ever so dead inside not worth the trouble ended up leaving right away"}
{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of old Vegas/Fremont street but I really liked coming here. There was no cover and we came around 10:30 and the place was dead, but by 11-11:30 it was really busy.   Blew my mind that on a weekend night they had 2 for 1 drinks until midnight. I was literally buying rounds of drinks for 6 people for under $30, unheard of in Vegas...or anywhere else for the most part (unless you're drinking Washington Apples during happy hour haha). The bartenders and staff were all really cool, a nice change of pace for Vegas.   They have human-sized Jenga, Connect 4, Chess, and Corn Hole (which is inside). It was a lot of fun.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed with the food our service here. They've never been busy and the staff is friendly. Prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. The spot is very diner-like. I've made this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Rollerblades!!!! The most fun I've had in a while. This retro themed night club in vegas is probably the coolest place. You have all these different games inside the club like speed ball, gigantic connect four, water guns and various arcade games. Outside you have this huge roller blade rink that is circled by huge Jenga, huge beer pong, and a bar.   The club itself is more lively outdoors than it is indoor. The music is good and the drinks are made well.   The roller blading is free and you just give them and Id to rent the skates.  If you're looking for something extra fun to do in vegas instead of the normal clubbing and drinking, come to gold spikes!"}
{"text":"This place is a living nightmare.  A bunch of trying too hard, fratty bros, playing yacht rock at absolutely unesecary volumes to literally 5 people at 2 in morning . This place is the worst."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I have had two negative visits that will keep me from ever wanting to return. The first one happened to my friend; they took her license and made her pay for ANOTHER persons tab and refused to give her her license back until she paid for it. That should have been enough to keep me out of here but this was the real clincher.   On a Monday night I went out with a few friends to celebrate graduation and to hang out. In order to enter the bar they took a photo of me and scanned my license. I then went to the bar and ordered a drink and handed the bartender my credit card and told him to keep my tab open. At the end of the night I approached the bar to close out my tab and the bartender told me that he has given my card to Someone else and that he was sorry and I should just call and cancel my card. He also covered my tab but I don't feel that this fully makes up for what happened. This person he gave my card to then went and made purchases using my card causing me further headache. Normally I would agree that the bartender made a mistake. However, the fact that I had to have my photo taken when I had my ID Checked to enter the bar upsets me since the bartenders did not make any effort to make sure that the credit cards they were returning to people actually belonged to that person. They have such a focus on security for their front door but take minimal precautions to make sure that the correct person is signing for their credit card.   If this happened to me on a Monday night then I wonder what may have happened on a busy Saturday when at least a hundred tabs are open at once."}
{"text":"Andie did a wonderful job very helpful and pleasant attitude!!! Had a great time!! Great music great environment!! Check it out for sure"}
{"text":"Visitor from CA.  Friend brought me here. There were four of us. We were killing time for some plans we had in Fremont.  Must say I was happy to have stopped by.  It was a Saturday night, was a bit earlier than 10pm but was a small crowd.  We didn't get to check out the whole venue, but we did decide to play a couple rounds of beer pong.   They also have, which is well shown in other reviews--larger versions of the games as well as others.   Was a good time and would recommend for a fun night out drinking. I will likely return."}
{"text":"I'm a local and I spend thousands of dollars every week on bar tabs, because I can. I've been a faithful customer of Gold Spike for over four years, I absolutely love the theme. I encourage all of my friends to check it out, but maybe not anymore.  My last experience at Gold Spike was absolutely unacceptable. I live in Las Vegas and come from a customer experience background. I'm one of those people that tips profusely. typically 30 to 40%. But my group was recently kicked out because the WOMENS restroom was closed for whatever reason, it doesn't matter.   But the Australian women I was with, figured it would be all right if they took a stall in the men's bathroom.... Seeing that its the closest and only option available. These women were sober, and willing to engage in conversation about why they took such action. The security guard gave zero F*cks and said it was his decision to kick us out.   I understand that it's his choice, but maybe this particular security guard has too much power.. Because he kicked out an entire group of sober people that were spending good money."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Drinks are a good price. Music is always on point. Not too many ppl that you can't get thru or to the  bathroom.  I like the adult version playground outside like jenga,  hopscotch, 4 square,  checkers,  etc.  They even have a big Ass sized version of beer pong. Only thing that ticks me off is that when I'm outside literally standing at the door, security makes you walk all the damn way around the building , even when the bathroom is seriously 5 steps from the door!  If it was packed, for security reasons,  I could understand, but if I need to go  realllyyy bad, n no one is in the hallway blocking me, why make me walk around building ?  :("}
{"text":"I love this place, until I had to get a full patdown and biometric face scan to get in. Never going back."}
{"text":"Chili cheese dog ranking is a 7 out of 10.  Monica at the counter who helped serve us outside was so nice and kind.  She truly appreciated our business."}
{"text":"Love this place went here in the summer time & had a great time so when I went to Vegas for new years I knew this was the place to go. They have a full kitchen inside the club with arcade games a fully stocked bar and a dance floor with seating all around with a dj. Outside they usually have a band playing or another Dj, there's hookah , oversized games (beer pong, bean bag toss, tether ball, foursquare) & more. There's also an additional bar outside.  It's loads of fun never a disappointment.   It's 21+ to get in"}
{"text":"The DJ is terrible tonite. Nobody is dancing. He needs to learn how to feel the crowd that he has. Fellas don't waste your $10 at the door."}
{"text":"This review is only for the grill. Angelina was our server and she was so friendly and personable. Her service was excellent and she makes dining so enjoyable. Will definitely come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"we stayed at the Oasis and eat breakfast at the  Gold Spike . The waitress Angelina is the best happiest friendliest ever. I cant wait to see her again in May. The Cooks are great  wonderful food"}
{"text":"Wow Tony Hseih when did downtown become unfriendly to locals; why should we be waiting in line and paying a cover?"}
{"text":"Had a real good time at this adult fun center with two full-size pool tables and a menagerie of assorted games all over with a center bar.  Very roomy atmosphere, a bed in the middle.  Who knows what goes on there?  A fun center for adults.  Cool first date place or place to hang out with your buddies."}
{"text":"The food was good. And the prices were really good for the quality of food. But the late night service out by the billiards area way awful. And it took 30 mins for burgers. And even longer for med rare steak and fried chicken. And non of our food came at the same time. Not to mention we were the only people eating a 12 am wed morning. Then the server decided to split our check in a weird way and we didn't even ask her to split it. And I hate waiting for water refils, kind of makes me crazy. Only a 3 for bad service."}
{"text":"Gold Spike is truly the adult playground of Vegas.  I loved how they have a little something for everyone such as a giant beer pong, twister, live music, a dance floor, lounging areas etc. I also liked that on a busy Saturday night they had multiple bars open, so the wait wasn't long at all. I enjoyed my time at Gold Spike and I would love to return with a big group of friends, so we could have some fun."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for youth 20-upper 30's. Wish it was around when I was that age."}
{"text":"OoooooWeeeee,  #cousintime w/ my Nea..the other Nea (yes, I have 2 Nea's and I love the same) but YASSSS! This is the spot for me, it's #RECESS for adults.  I promise, this took me back to elementary, but this is the ULTIMATE RECESS session.    Ok, it would be a 5STAR rating but I have to take a STAR away for the BOUNCERS/DOORMAN and this 1 rude ass bartender.  These doorman/bouncers are HIT or MISS, regardless if you're downtown or on mega strip.  HOWEVER, when you are bouncer downtown (if you could see my face) I'm gonna need you to bring it down SEVERAL DAMN NOTCHES.  Look here, I totally get it, just b/c I am female does not automatically mean that I will be pulled to the front and the red carpet will be rolled out for me.  But this mean mugging, chest all puffed out, fake frown, no personality is played da hell out.  It sets the TONE of the establishment before you even walk into the building.  Frfr, it was this big burly ass ****a walking around w/ black latex gloves, cracking his knuckles ready for something to JUMP OFF.  I mean c'mon man, I'm not saying things don't pop in an environment such as this BUT damn!  I really didn't understand why he had the latex gloves on, still over here wondering.  But that's their job, do a mental SMH show your id and walk in, don't let that ruin your evening b/c this is a fun place to be.  As for the bartender, maybe she was having a bad night, idc and irdfc, it's your job.  However your night is going, unfortunately you have to suck it up and PASTE on the fake smile for the customer.  She had major attitude, but once again, do a mental SMH and walk away, you will not ruin my night.  Back to the ULTIMATE RECESS, the inside is cool but walk outside and WHOA!  I felt like my 6yr nephew when we go to the park.  Eyes grew super big, I damn jumped up and down w/ giddiness b/c I was ready to play.  So we walked around, a variety of games, beer pong, cornhole, big ass Jenga, sidewalk chess, FOUR SQUARE and TETHERED BALL, say what, say huh?? I'm gonna say it again #FOURSQUARE and #TETHEREDBALL, yes I did jump in line to play some 4Square and had so much fun.  The ultimate shit talking and competition, and it was FIERCE that night.  As one player stated, \"we SAVAGES tonight, so you better come prepared\"  I was not prepared, but I did make it to the the 3rd square twice.  I'm going back...it's so on.  Dj and dance floor outside, the DJ did his thing, he was cool.    The inside games...G-A-L-A-G-A, yep and I still got my skills, even under the influence.  Aww this was my game back in the day.  Too little to reach the joystick, so I would stand on a chair and rack up my score.  Well 30+ yrs later, under the influence I still racked up the HIGH score.  Skee-ball, connect4 which sits on the wall, pool tables and a photo booth.    There's a restaurant inside too, #FIDDLESTIX I have to go back and try them out.  All in all, I had a BLAST at Gold Spike this past weekend and will definitely be telling friends about this place too.  Umm, so who's down for any of the following: - Galaga - Skee-ball - Connect4 - 4Square - Tethered Ball  Just let me know, I'll meet you there..."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a couple weeks ago and it was a blast!  The games in the back are awesome and we even got a decent amount of people playing 4 square. The lounge area of the Gold Spike is nice too and has a mellow ambiance.  The bathrooms were clean and the games were fun, I just wish we came when there was some live music or something."}
{"text":"I recently read an article in DTLV about the new Gold Spike and knew I had to check it out. I had never been in it before, but I can say they did an awesome job. First of all, all of the staff is super friendly and relaxed, super important if you are inviting people to come over and hang out. They have a huge ben and gig-ass bean bags to relax on, as well as a foosball table, darts and an area to check out game to play with, like Monopoly, Clue, etc. The bar area looks nice; I will have to return to try some of their drinks. There were a ton of people at the bar working on their laptops.   Outside they have a mega Jenga to play with as well as an Airstream camper with a kiddie pool to dip your feet in. It's getting kind of hot, so ideally you would hang out there in the evening.   I will definitely be back to grab a drink but I also feel like brining a book with me on the weekend and just relaxing."}
{"text":"Hands down. this is the place to go.   My drunk group of friends and I ventured down to Fremont to come here, since there was no coverage and it was free rollerblading on a Wednesday night. How can you turn down that offer? Seriously.   When you walk in theres a big dance floor, gaming section, bar, couches, and good vibes. When you walk out to the back, MORE games, like jenga, teeter ball, gigantic beer pong and a freaking roller blading rink! did I say LIT?! If not let me say it one more time. LIT. I guarantee you'll have a great time at this place as my friends and me did. It was awesome watching each other bust our asses on the rink. The music was very chill as well and created a dancing environment. So drunk roller blading + good music = a great Wednesday night for us.   I highly recommend coming to this place if you are visiting Downtown Las Vegas. It'll be an awesome experience for you and your friends."}
{"text":"By far one of my most favorite places to hang not only downtown, but anywhere in Vegas. I've frequented this spot a handful of times and each time I leave happy as a clam. If you're looking for something unique off the strip or maybe somewhere new to take friends when they visit Gold Spike is definitely the spot!   The atmosphere is very carefree with a laid back vibe; not at all stuffy or pretentious. Picture a HUGE hangout spot you can enjoy with your friends. And when I say huge, I mean they literally have HUGE life size games open for anyone to play...for FREE!! From giant Jenga, to corn hole, to chess and gigantic beer pong, there's plenty of good wholesome fun catered especially towards adults.   Friday and Saturday nights are usually pretty popin'. But no worries, they have 3 full bars (two indoors and one outside) to get your thirst quenched. You can come casual, or dressed up, just make sure you're down for a good time!"}
{"text":"I've come to realize after 6 visits here, on saturdays weds and Fridays, that the experience from 7-11pm is great, and 12+ is just frustrating.  I enjoy the little four square and giant pong along with corn hole set ups.  The music and live bands that do make appearances are a lovely addition.  The crowd for the most part is nice.  The vibe and ambiance prior to midnight is more of an active and friendly, music oriented, demographic with fun being the priority.  At midnight the DJs get lazy and leave shitty music playing and leave the station.  Plus the crowd gets more and more immature, rude, obnoxious and less friendly.  A total flip of just a few hours early.  My friends that came early, we have a great time.  The ones that appear around 11:30-12+ cannot find parking and just wanna leave and do something else.  I liked the two bar set up along with the overall lounging placements.  One in the back and the front.  I enjoy waitresses that walk around as well.  It's pretty spacious overall.  They got pool tables and shuffle board!  Lotta games to be honest.  Darts is my shit xD. I just love my time here.   But 12 is straight doodoo.  The good vibes and friendly play and interaction amongst locals and tourist alike disappears quickly once it gets later.  It's upsetting.  A 4star or 5star rating for 7-11pm and a 2-3star rating 11:30pm and on.  Check it out and see for yourself, it's a nice spot :)"}
{"text":"I didn't know Vegas had a place like this. This is a huge playground for adults. The inside is like an adult's only Dave and Busters with a small dance floor. The outside has these huge games, and even dodge ball.  I'm not sure why the reviews aren't so great here?! Maybe I'm just a big kid at heart."}
{"text":"Don't wait in line for the indoor bathroom:  go outside and to your right, there's a 5 stall bathroom that never has a line :)  I played 4 square while listening to the DJ play Cupid Shuffle last night. This place always reminds me of middle school recess, but with alcohol instead of Caprisuns.  Gold Spike is the locals spot. Those guys from High School you hoped to never see again? You will definitely run into them here. You may also run into your 50-something year old teacher from back then too, since a lot of older folks frequent here.    Gold Spike is fun! Guys don't need to awkwardly stand around the bar or the bathroom to try to talk to girls. You don't even have to worry about having a drink in your hand at all times- I never know what to do with my hands if I don't have one! Play a game, invite some strangers over. No one will call you a creep :)   I've never had disappointing late night drunk food..... until I had their fries. yuck :("}
{"text":"Had a lot of cool things there music is great just somewhat a younger crowd. We're going to try a different night."}
{"text":"Well it didn't work out when getting into omnia so we went here instead and I loved it. It's so much fun and has something to do for everyone. The whole crew can dance, eat, play arcade games or play beer pong, Corn-hole, or even life sized beer pong. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas and am hoping for something like this to pop up in San Diego"}
{"text":"Thank you so much to Kashif! My birthday party was so much fun! Me and all my coworkers had a great night. If you are looking for a fun place to go out consider here!"}
{"text":"Honestly yeah they have have good shit going on but my main concern was there so called \"SECURITY\" first of all they bribe costumers to wanna cut in front of the line by tipping them and they wanna act all friendly and be personal, then one day you go on a non paid day and they wanna treat you like a stranger, Point is they let one of my friends in with an expired ID  than a week later they ask us again if we're willing to leave them a tip they will take us to the front of the line and we replay \"sorry dude, today I'm broke so they move on to ask the next people behind us than about half an hour later or so we get to the front  we sll pool ot our id's and they act like they never meet us and we even explain that the week before they let us in and they literally kick us out not wanting to reason things out and on top of that one of the securities tried to get down with one of my sisters and pushed her, seriously like grown ass man on woman type of shit and thats when I lost it but then my sister knocked some scenes into me making me realize he wasn't worth it and so me trying to be the big person knowing that these men had fu**** up I left. You guys don't know me but that's a big deal I can't just walk away from a man disrespecting a woman and so I'm posting this as my review because I don't believe people should be treated this way by a holes that we expect to protect us from this type of violence. And don't the owners want us to come back they should really focus on the people that are not letting us in."}
{"text":"GREAT Atmosphere.  Live music out back. DJ inside. Nice drink prices and a very casual feel.  Had a BLAST and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place off Fremont! Great atmosphere and it offers both the upbeat club ambiance AND the laid back patio atmosphere complete with LIVE music.   The patio is beyond awesome with cool nostalgic backyard games like tetherball, beanbag toss, chess and of course beer pong!   Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was discriminated against and turned away at the door for not being \"model material \" by not having enough make up on my face, instead the guard at the door claimed (lied) I was too drunk. I apologize for being my natural self and wanting to have a good time with my friends.  Thank you.  An honest, negative comment won't hurt your following."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out on a weekend night! Coworkers had raved about Gold Spike, but it wasn't until I had my brother in town that I decided to visit. I was definitely impressed.  Gold Spike is a comprehensive hang out. There is drinking, games, and food. The location includes an indoor area as well as a large outdoor area. Inside there is a large bar, the food area, Connect Four, Foosball, darts, and pool tables. Outside was where most of the games were located. There were several cornhole boards, beer pong, giant beer pong, Four Square, Twister, tetherball, and giant Jengas. They definitely carry a variety of games to appeal to a variety of people.   Obviously, this is a popular spot so getting use of the games can be challenging, especially the outdoor games. We were able to play a variety of games over the course of the night and without too much of a wait. The only complaint I would have is that several of the games were broken or missing pieces which contributed to wait times on the functional games. Twister had broken glass pieces on it, cornhole boards were missing bags, the giant beer pong was missing a ball, Four Square's ball was missing, and pieces of the foosball table were broken. Nothing is perfect, but it's hard to justify coming for games when so many are broken or missing pieces. I think this place would be a five if they would do a quality check on pieces and functionality of the games each night.  There were two bars, one inside and one outside. The bar inside had little to no wait and was quick. The outside bar was more popular, but the wait times were still reasonable. Drink prices were okay when factoring in that entertainment is provided."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this place. It is frequented by a hipsterish crowd and I like to keep it simple. If you like yard games, crowds, and overpriced drinks, this is your scene."}
{"text":"Attended a birthday party here and the place was awesome!  Great staff, very unique decor and setup. Well stocked bar with some unique items including some great beers you don't normally find in bars. Well done Gold Spike, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I was very impressed with the place.  There is PLENTY of seating inside!  To the left of the bar, there was a king sized bed, bean bags, and lots and lots of tables.  I really enjoyed the fact that there was enough space to hang out and not feel like a sardine.  They also have a cafe where you could grab some food and there is also shuffleboard, pool tables, and this glow in the dark room inside.  Outside it feels like I'm at a kickback in somebody's backyard.  It was very chill and relaxing.  There was a couple of couches in the corner and some tables scattered around.  You can play giant connect 4, giant jenga, beer pong, and that game where you toss  a beanbag into a hole.  The night I went there, they also had a live band playing, suh-weeet!    Their drink prices are pretty awesome too.  I had sangria for $8 and my friend got snakebites (guinness and cider) for $6.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the wait to get the bartender's attention.  It wasn't very busy at the bar, but the bartender ignored me and the two other girls I was with (even though we were right in front of him)  and tended to these other guys who got there after us.  We waited to get his attention for 10 minutes and my friend said it's always like that...  So ladies, if you want a drink, you should probably take a man friend with you to get the bartender's attention.    I really enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks are priced right.  I'll come back for more good vibes!"}
{"text":"With no cover fee, Gold Spike is a great staple for Downtown Las Vegas. The environment just screams social, as this place is full of fun activities. This isn't your average \"let's go grab a drink\" bar... there's so much to do and there is a lot of room to relax and hang out. But really though... who doesn't love giant jenga with strangers and friends?  Attire is whatever you want it to be... I've seen people come in casual and I have seen many other dressed to impress.   Can't speak for the food whatsoever as I don't ever remembering ordering food. The parking situation isn't too bad if you understand how Downtown works. I believe it is free after 6pm (or 8pm?) on the streets."}
{"text":"This place is SO cool!   I live in Santa Monica, currently known as Silicon Beach, and have worked in the actual Silicon Valley and in San Francisco, yet none of these places, which are teeming with tech employees and entrepreneurs who work remotely, has come around to the brilliant idea of opening a free, welcoming space for those who work remotely to use free wifi, outlets, and plenty of seating in exchange for the use of a full bar and full food menu, with some cool party games thrown in for good measure. Instead I'm constantly being guilted out of staying in a coffee shop too late or fighting with someone for the ONE outlet in a restaurant.   Why don't more people realize that if you make people comfortable while they're working, they're going to want to stay and spend money? That's what Drew A and I did when we had a work sesh here on a weekday afternoon - we got beers, some nibbles, had a meeting, then closed things off with a rousing game of giant cornhole. While we were there a group was using the projector for a screening of an independent documentary. This is the kind of community centered business that I want to see more of!   From what I hear it gets pretty lively at night... the fact that it stays open late at night is another brilliant aspect of this fun and casual all purpose space.   Please, bring this to California - I'll be forever grateful!"}
{"text":"Good for casual night out with friends, they have several games which you can play. Music and atmosphere makes it better!! I"}
{"text":"Don't ask for darts!!!  I want to first say that I have had many positive experiences at the Gold Spike in the past, but last Saturday night was not one of them.  My wife and a friend of ours head in to have a drink and play some darts. We noticed someone is already playing at one of the boards so we go to the bartender to ask for darts for us. She tells me that she has no more darts. I ask her if some got lost or if there were any more in the back possibly. She then tells me that I need to understand that darts get lost and there is nothing she can do about it and that I need to quit asking. At this point I'm completely shocked and say to her, \"I'm not just some drunk tourist I really don't appreciate your attitude.\" Her exact words back to me were, \"You're about to become a drunk tourist and you can get out of here if you don't like it.\"  Now, I can understand completely that Saturday nights are busy but to give someone attitude and tell them to leave simply because they were asking for darts?   By the way the bartender's name was Heather. If you're at Gold Spike and Heather is behind the bar taking your drink order I would think twice before assuming her service will be friendly!"}
{"text":"It's funny how my previous 1-star review was taken down. Fishy...  The cashier at the entrance on Saturday, July 9 at around 11pm had a terrible attitude and was treating the guys like crap for no reason. Not surprisingly, another reviewer (Nathan R.) mentioned her too.   On the other hand, the security was quick and efficient. They weren't warm but they weren't rude either.  I used to enjoy coming here but because of that cashier's nasty attitude my pals and I would rather go to PT's or any other bar downtown that makes us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"We came here for my friends bday on a Saturday night and we had the WORST experience. I was mind boggled. 2 guys and 4 girls. We weren't drunk or being obnoxious. We got to the front, me and my 2 guy friends got in just fine but after waiting inside for 10 minutes we were wondering what happened to the girls. We went outside and saw that there was a dispute with the manager. Apparently my friend couldn't get in because her ID didn't look like her. She had other identification cards that are clearly her and the fact that the manager had the audacity to say \"nope not her\" yet he's on the phone and probably letting underage girls in. It's so disappointing because it was our friends birthday. We're not little kids, we're in our late twenties for Pete's sake! Probably better off somewhere else because this establishment was a joke. Although the other bouncer on the side exit was nice. Props to him. Other than that we ended up at Inspire (roof top club) which we didn't have any problem getting in."}
{"text":"It all starts with a door camera that captures your face. Excessive? Mayhaps. But at least they aren't intense about it. It looks more aggressive than they make it feel, I guess. Still a little weird though.   The inside of this place has a square bar full of stools  on one side, with large beds and couches on the other. I can see beds and drinks leading to netflix and chill without the netflix. I don't trust them.  I know this doesn't sound great so far but here is the good part: They got a real WOW factor I never would have anticipated. They have an abundance of oversized games! They have dart boards half the size of your body, they have beer pong played with a soccer ball and industrial trash cans themed as cups, TETHERBALL, corn hole, chess, jenga, friggin 4 square?!! Get out of town. That is the coolest adult hang out for adult children I've ever seen.  I will say though... while most of the bar staff was friendly through the drinks we purchased, there was one crab I found there. I asked for a water cup to dilute the alcohol we paid pretty good money for, and he seemed genuinely upset at our responsibility as he flagged us off to a water dispenser and went on about his business with no eagerness to please since we weren't specifically buying drinks anymore. Only nice if we are purchasing from/tipping to you? Not how life works.  Other than that guy... dope spot. Check it out."}
{"text":"Ok this place is super COOOOL!!! Fun atmosphere, games, connect 4, pool, hacky sack and outside area WITH AN ICE RINK!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few nights ago only hearing good things, and it was a lot of fun! I'm a huge fan of games at bars and this is the place for that! They have beer pong, corn hole, even four square! It's like a giant playground for adults.   The only con that I've heard is that on the weekends it gets very packed so it's difficult to play any game."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Games drinks and great music! I really wish we had one of these in California! But every time I'm in Vegas this is a place I have to attend!"}
{"text":"Three stars because I have never had a bad experience in the past. However, last night my ID got denied for being, \"fake as f***\" as the professional at the door told me. I'm 26, not that that excludes me from ever being denied at a bar, but my ID is not fake. I understand that it looks a little different than other IDs from my state (it's the \"enhanced\" MN ID so I can fly domestically after 2018) however, it's your job as a business holding a liquor license to stay up to date and current with state IDs. Now had this situation been resolved in a more polite manner, I wouldn't be here writing this review.   Side note- I was in the bar earlier that evening and made multiple alcohol purchases without getting carded at all so the standard at Gold Spike seems fairly inconsistent."}
{"text":"My sister and I enjoyed Friday night here, during Pride weekend. We parked for $15 in the lot next door. Ladies had no cover, gentlemen were $10. It was very busy! The crowd was very diverse different ages, races, and even a bachelorette party. The vibe was lively and they played a variety of pop, rock, and rap music. I love all games, my sister played 4 square a bunch, word to the wise don't wear heels if you wanna play! We then wandered into the fenced off area to play octopi get! Pitchers of Bud Light are $25-rip off in my opinion but whatever. The band was really good but I didn't pay attention to who it was. They had the hotels restrooms open, it has a communal hand washing area for both sexes. The restroom was well maintained and they had people handing paper towels out to keep the flow going. All in all we had a great time!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out, have some drinks and play games.  It is hit and miss as to how crowded it will be, but for adults looking for some good music, good drinks, lots of entertainment, this is the place to go.  This was our 3rd visit to Gold Spike and each time we have had a great time and have never been disappointed.  If you are down on Fremont, stop in, toss a bean bag or go outside and play some Jenga.  The only way you will not have fun is if you don't allow yourself to..."}
{"text":"Decent place for locals to come out and party! There are tons of activities to do as well as a few bars.   The activities include a back patio with a stage, life size jenga, and other carnival type games. Really chill place to come and out and socialize and have a great time!   Cover is a little expensive sometimes on busy weekends especially for locals."}
{"text":"Good place to get liiiiit. S/o to Chief the security guard. Made my experience 10 times better."}
{"text":"Love this place! This could be my favorite spot in downtown Las Vegas.   For bar food this place is seriously the best. It blows anywhere else out of the water with their nachos, tater tots, chicken wings, sliders ahhh all so good! I've never had a food here that I didn't like.  If you come early or during the week it's not too crowded either so it's perfect for taking advantage of all the games. The catch is you have to leave your id though so make sure you don't forget it before you dip out.   The only downside to this place is the bathrooms which are super small and tends to get really annoying on the weekends with never ending lines to the ladies room. Just try not to break the seal too early and you'll be golden!"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is my absolute favorite place Downtown. Whether you're into the the party inside, the bohemian / chill vibe outside, or you're there for four square and giant beer pong Gold Spike offers something for everyone. Aside from all of the incredible fun, the best part about Gold Spike is the security. I always feel safe and protected here because I know that the boys are maintaining a secure environment for everyone.  You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Omg where have I been?! I have been a long time downtown patron and had no idea this place existed. Lol, geez.  Thought this place was cool, still don't know if this place is even a hotel or not.  Reminds me of the 3rd floor of Cosmo.  And you know what, it doesn't smell like downtown in here.  It's equipped with a DJ and lots of games to challenge your friends. I must be faded Because I can't even play tic tac toe. Lol.    To good times in the heart if downtown!"}
{"text":"Super fun place had huge beer pong and some grass furniture, we went on roller blading day"}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect for mid-day fun. Life-sized games like Jenga and Cornhole. Gluten free drink options like cider and they even serve Estrella which I never see anywhere. Fun atmosphere and good music. Hard not to have a good time at Gold Spike."}
{"text":"I am a local and I can not believe I haven't been to this gem before!!! I will recommend this place to everyone I know!!!  Gigi, Addias and Rickey were so awesome and down to earth!!! They are amazing and I wish all their employees were like them!!!"}
{"text":"Like i said. I usually give a place a second chance. Second time i went. No scratch that,  i almost went another day. But there was some commotion going on at the front door.  The security was giving a guy a hard time. And the girl he was with was not happy about it. In their defense he seemed over intoxicated. So the group i was with decided to go elsewhere.  Fast forward a few weeks............... Decided hey lets try this again. Let me start by saying,  mgt must have paid attention to yelp reviews.  Because the security at the door was on a totally different level. Professional yet not overbearing .  Once inside had a very pleasurable evening. Atmosphere was nice. Music was decent.  And the crowd was a true las vegas mix.  Definitely worth hanging out here now and again. Especially if you're a local. Not sure of happy hour and other perks. But once i go back a few more times, i will inform about deals and more."}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly. I went on a Sunday around 2pm it was super chill until a group of like 20 people came in screaming. Try the bloody mary! It was the best one I've ever had. The bartender said he made it from scratch not sure if that was true but it was still awesome."}
{"text":"Goldspike is definitely the gem of downtown Las Vegas. With its great location (surrounded by parking and off the main path), awesome food (definitely try the nachos), and great premise, this is the place to be if you are in need of going back to your childhood, but mixing it with alcohol.   Brought here by friends for my 28th birthday I was pleasantly surprised by how big the place was. We played the giant connect 4, giant jenga, and giant beer pong (noticing a theme?), and I even tried my hand at some darts (I sucked). Couldn't tell you how much food or drinks was since I didn't pay, but the waitress came to our table with refills whenever we began to run low.  The music was great, with the dj playing top 40 hits as well as some classics with a reggae twist.  The people here were super friendly and they had a live band that consisted of some guys from Canada who could sing/play their hearts out.  The bathrooms were very clean and the food was piping hot. I thought the addition of girls going around the room hula hooping was dope.  Can't wait to come back, best birthday ever!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the service is great!!! It's so awesome that I actually moved into one of their remodeled studio apartments. The drink prices are the cheapest downtown, live bands daily, and some of the best local DJ's play from Wed-Saturday nights. The cafe prices are very reasonable and food tastes great! And also EVERY 3rd Wednesday of the month, they have FREE ROLLERSKATING with FREE ROLLER SKATES for you to use. Check them out whenever you are in Vegas and Downtown Fremont St. They also have oversized Beer Pong, Chess, and Jinga games to play for FREE!!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. Went there with a girlfriend and John H. was amazing. Always on top of our drinks. Shift change and John S. comes on. Totally different atmosphere. So unfriendly and rude. Took away two stars because of his attitude."}
{"text":"The service is very fast and attentive to everyone's needs.  The menu is varied and everyone, no matter what their dietary restrictions, was able to have a huge meal.  I had the Chili Cheese Dog, and it was huge!  I couldn't even finish the fries that came with it.  That big juicy wiener was so good!  My friend had the prime rib that tasted great, although it did consist of about 30% fat that you couldn't eat.  They were very good about substitutions and were always around for water refills."}
{"text":"watch out for the bulldog cashier with the green hair. She's not afraid to be unprofessional and jump from behind the counter at you for something that she thought you said. Haha never again. Bad vibes and shitty staff. Unwelcoming and negative."}
{"text":"Had friends meet for a birthday party here! 1st time I've been there heard about it Glad I went had a fantastic time! Sitting outside on the turf furniture with the heater and fire pit going it was just perfect on a cool nite last nite . Don't have to wait for service from cocktail servers or self service plenty of bars open even on a Saturday nite. Music outside live and Dj spinning inside whatever you like to spend your time doing there you'll have fun! Playing beer pong or giant chess? It a great time very hip I will recommend this cool establishment to all my friends and I'll be back"}
{"text":"Went again about a month ago.. Overpacked and a fight broke out in the line that took a hour to get through. Left after ten minutes of getting inside."}
{"text":"A 10 minute walk from Fremont Street, this is a great place to hang and drink in a chill environment. This is actually where The Real World Las Vegas was filmed also, which is cool.   Inside and outside there are larger than life games such as beer pong, cornhole, etc. Lots of places to hang out and mingle; it would be a fun party spot! They also have food inside, which is why we came in the first place. (Nothing on Fremont was open, besides a few places). Food from Fiddlestix was great!"}
{"text":"Great spot during the daytime for meetings, they have wifi so you can take care of business!  Great spot to hang at night, the place becomes a fun hangout spot!  There is pool tables, board games, a bar with darts and fooseball.  They also have the carnival bar now too.  If you're hungry there is a cafe inside too with pretty decent food.  Some nights they have a live DJ there as well.  Outside in the patio area you can play giant Jenga, giant beer pong, giant chess or checker, ping pong tables, and/or enjoy a nice fire pit.  They also have an area for live bands to perform.  A lot of patio seating outside too to relax."}
{"text":"Always a good place to visit when I'm in Vegas. The place starts getting pack around 11-12 at night on Friday and Saturday. The vibe is pretty chill and they usually have a Dj playing. There's always fun games to do with your friends. The giant beer pong cups, giant jenga, checkers, etc.   There's a lot of beer and drink selections as well. Not a lot on the tap but a good amount to get your drink on. Drinks are pretty cheap compared to the other bars in Vegas."}
{"text":"Descent drink prices, awesome music both inside and outside, great vibe! Oh and bring your girlfriends ;) the bouncer will let you in before everyone. Overall, love this place! Never a dull moment. There's games and stuff. Oh! On Wednesday they do drunken roller skating"}
{"text":"Ruben has been wanting to check the improved Gold Spike out for a while, but I've been hesitant - what was there to see? Well, I was wrong! It turns out I've been to Gold Spike during a Superhero Pub Crawl a couple years ago. The only thing recognizable now was the bar! What used to be a casino is now comfortable Love Sacs, modern furniture and decor, a bed, and various games. It's quite the transformation.  After admiring the area, Ruben and I settled down for a few games of Tic Tac Toe with a large version set on one of the tables. As we continued to venture, we discovered shuffleboard (deck version), cornhole, billiards, life-size connect four, and more. We also played a game of connect four, which we really enjoyed!  Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez. You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a \"bar\" and it's neon paint and objects against a black backdrop. You may also be able to go inside?  The best part of this newly renovated Gold Spike is definitely the \"Backyard\" as they've coined it. Complete with synthetic grass, patio furniture, fire pits, additional cornhole games, life-size jenga, life-size beer pong, bullet trailer, and \"Cold Spike,\" their ice skating rink. Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5, but I read that this is an all-day price like The Cosmopolitan. The rink looked nice and it's large compared to the others in town, however, I heard that it's not really ice! Which makes sense why they haven't shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it's possibly being converted into a roller rink). The furniture was rather dirty, so I didn't take the chance of sitting down, but we really enjoyed a game of life-size jenga! Make sure you wear shoes or run quickly when it falls!   Overall, really cool place to chill with friends and grab a couple drinks. The only mood killer was the smell!! It reeks of bad bathroom freshener that was trying really hard to mask (rather than eliminate) odors, but failed miserably. It was hard to stay inside for a long period of time and you could still smell it while in the Backyard as well, though not as bad."}
{"text":"This place can be a ton of fun depending on the night.  Typically a younger crowd for sure.   Lot's of games for entertainment and a great environment inside and out but drinks are spendy for sure.   Pretty sure Real World was recorded here recently (we were there but buzzed and confused by the cameras).  We checked out skating on a Wednesday this past month- could be a ton of fun but dangerous also, especially since they couldn't seem to keep rocks off the rink.   -Four Square -Corn Hole -Huge Beer Pong with trash cans -Big Jinga  -Big Connect-Four on the wall Most important- Ski Ball ....and some other fun games"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar to go to in Las Vegas. I mostly go on Sundays because of the great 2 for 1 deal. You should really consider doing the roller night on a weekend sometime."}
{"text":"My second time here last night for a pre-bachelorette party I have been here two times the first time it was totally packed they have an ID check which is really strange with like a camera but the bartenders a super cool there's a lot of lounge couch is it located downtown but you'll get a nice crowd if you don't want to spend money on $25 drinks downtown is starting to get better and this is a good spot to either start your evening or Andrew evening there's music dancing there's a lot of things going on in this place But I've enjoyed myself the two times that I was there"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I don't live in Vegas but my friend is a local so he brought me here and I fell in love. This place is so great! It's 24 hours and they have all sorts of childhood games for adults! They had a giant bean bag toss, giant jenga, giant twister, GIANT BEER PONG, and giant connect four. Everything was huge. Oh my god, you have no idea how exciting it was.   There's no cover fee for girls but there's a $10 cover fee for guys after I believe 10PM.  This place is great because the interior is beautifully decorated. The ambiance is very loungey and comfortable. They have these really great booths inside and a 24 hour kitchen. How great is that?? This beats all the bars and clubs that I've been to. I'd much rather come here than to a big, crowded club.   I went to the restaurant to get some food because I was starving! They had a large menu with everything from soups to sandwiches to tacos. There's also a kids meal so I recognize that this place caters to adults and children. I got the fish tacos with fries. The tacos weren't great, but I wasn't there for the food. There was not a lot of fish in the taco itself. It was mostly breading. The fries were good though. The staff were all really nice at the restaurant.   Everyone is very friendly and the environment is relaxed. Drinks range from about $7-12, but they have happy hour from 4PM-7PM and 4AM-7AM. I was there on a Friday night at around 2am-4am, and there was surprisingly a lot of people. I was so surprised that this place was packed at that hour.   There's a parking lot across the street that charges $2-3 an hour, so parking is relatively reasonable. I will definitely be bringing friends back to this place in the future.   This entire area in DTLV is so great!"}
{"text":"This place and the whole complex is a diamond in the rough. The outside of this old Vegas hotel looks crappy, but the interior is way trendy. This is how hipsters do Vegas. The overall restaurant reminded me if Fred's 62 in Los Feliz and Johnny Rockets had a baby.   The food wasn't too bad. I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich which was alright. The meat was a little tough and for the price I expected just a little better. Then again keep in mind that for being a 24h place in downtown Vegas, this place is not bad at all. This place is a solid 3.5 stars. The staff is very down to earth and the service was really good. It was a little slow but we were in a rush so it felt like it took forever. They have over 100 hot sauces that you can choose from which is a cool Concept, especially if you're into hot sauces."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout, good drinks, music and games, great concept. The food is horrendous, and that's why it gets 3 stars. Not a veggie or even a chicken burger option, no paninis, the fried fish sandwich, onion rings and steak fries were all smelly oil soggy and grosse. This place needs a decent kitchen and a way better menu, should learn a thing or two from Rachel's Kitchen next door."}
{"text":"Gold spike is super fun and Andie is amazing!!! Good drinks, good music, good events and all that"}
{"text":"I must say Gold Spike is a favorite place to go.  Unlike going out on the strip, getting dressed up and waiting in long lines, you don't have any of that here.  This place is north right off Fremont Street, and definitely worth your time if you're heading downtown.   My girlfriends and I come here a few times and we never have to pay a cover fee, wait in a long line, or get dressed up. Score! There is a dress code, but it's much more laid back here. When you walk in, you'll see they have a dance floor, an eatery, bars, and games. When you head outside, there is usually a band playing covers of various songs. They're pretty good and dance-able.  They have your childhood games-foursquare, tether ball, giant Jenga; and other variety of games both indoor and out.   I especially like coming to Gold Spike because I like to dance and the dj plays good music. You may be wondering what I consider \"good music.\" I like to dance to old 90's hip hop & pop. Even throws in some Motown and 80's rock. I jam out to all that.  Sing all the songs. I'm the one who doesn't care what I look like, as long as I'm having a good time with my girls. Every now and then they throw in edm and that's when I go outside to cool off, unless it's summer, I just walk to the other side to chill out. Another reason I like coming here, you can sit down. Inside or outside there are places to sit without paying, or having someone come to you to tell you it will be $1500 for the seat. Drinks here are not as expensive either, which I appreciate.    Staff here are pretty cool too. I've never had a bad experience with them, and they all have a good sense of humor.   If you are looking for a place to get down, without all the hoopla, this is the spot to go to."}
{"text":"I like going in here. It has a nice decor, perfect for the 23-year old in all of us, craving to move on from Chucky Cheese.  The only reason I don't go back is the cops tried to arrest me for jaywalking one night across street.  If I wasn't from Las Vegas and I wanted to visit the city, I would recommend the following attire to wear: 1.   White, 70s, low cut suit like the one Travolta wore in Saturday Night Fever 2.   Lots of gold necklaces 3.   The ubiquitous dress shirt and jeans that say - I'm a dumbass here to blow all my money on gambling.  If you wear anything else, the cops won't like you, and casinos won't like you. Hey who says the mob runs this town?"}
{"text":"So in love with this place I decided to have my husband's retirement party here on a Thursday night.  I tried to plan something out and then decided to just have everyone show up.  We ended up with 40+ people who had a blast playing games, listening to the band, drinking, eating and just hanging out.  Kids are allowed in until around 10 so it was nice to have them be able to attend.  THE perfect night!!"}
{"text":"Easy enter, long wait on drinks, and DJ needs better music!   Fritz was a great bartender! He was a very sweet gentleman and showed a lot about his personality! Kinda was watered down but it was worth the buy one get one. Just three out of five!!!"}
{"text":"This maybe a cool spot for younger or able-bodied citizens that live in the downtown area.  However,  for those that are disabled this place is a disaster.  The handicapped parking is on the far end of the parking lot. Free parking is 2 blocks away, most importantly,  there is a huge step to enter the property. Once inside, during the day it took awhile to adjust to the darkness.  The large space, pool tables, comfortable pod setting, well-organized music venue, throwback skeeball games and outside atrium is a perfect hipster retreat. I didn't try the food, the distance from the front door was too far, after struggling to get inside with my cane and service animal."}
{"text":"Adult size everything! Jenga beer pong connect 4 chess so much more! There's a band outside dj inside food and drinks there was even hookah!"}
{"text":"Would have been a cool bar but.... I went to the gold spike with coworkers on a business trip.  I was allowed to enter and they checked my bag on the way in.  After I was there for 2 hours I was approached by security and they told me I need to leave because of my bag.  I told the security employee, who was just doing his job, that he checked me on the way in and he can check me on the way out.  He told me that he was \" being nice\" to leave me into this regal establishment.  Really, \"Being nice\" ? Such a cheese ball line, and also it was insulting and  short of being an all out accusation.  Business owners like these are childish who unprofessional.  I hope the real owner of this company realizes what ammeter novices the  have working for them.  I arrived with 14 people, we left because the management harassed me. What kind of businesses owner kicks someone out due to being inside an establishment that allowed them to enter?"}
{"text":"I meannnnnn. Anyone who knows me knows this is my favorite spot in DTLV. Love the decor (couches + beds + bean bags), the space (it a converted hotel lobby), the price of drinks (sangria, well drinks), the music (both inside and out), the crowd, and the games (everything from life-size jenga to shuffleboard to cornhole)! You can literally bring anyone here and everyone will find something to like about it. We even got hooked up with coffee on a cold night @ the Diner! Used to be a hidden gem, but now becoming pretty popular. Still love it."}
{"text":"I liked this bar while visiting. I loved the life size games such as chess, peg board,  beer pong n more.  They have something each night. This place never sleeps..  The day bartender was nice but not big conversationalist. I mean I can see if it was busy but there were like us and one other person. A little conversation makes for more money.. #ijs. The night bartenders more busy but gave the customer a few more minutes to chat. #weird..."}
{"text":"Aaron who worked the bar was amazing today on 1/27. Me and a bunch of my co workers came for lunch is he was sooo patient with us even though we kept on sending him to the back for something. That's the best service I got from a bar in a really long time. For it to be your first day behind bar keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went to visit Gold Spike for the first time for my friend's birthday party. While standing in line waiting to get in, a bouncer came up to me and told me I am not allowed in, and refused to explain why I was being singled out of the line. I have been clubbing literally hundreds of times, and this is the first time I've ever been denied entry to a club.  This is bad business, and I will be telling everyone I know to stay far away from this venue. I called my friends in the club, and everyone left and we went elsewhere. I will never come back to Gold Spike."}
{"text":"USED to love Gold Spike, now I avoid it like the plague. The clientele is douchy, the fact that I have to get PAT DOWN to get in is douchey, and that as a guy I have to pay to get in, when there are an infinite number of spots downtown that I can have more fun, is SUPER douchey.   Gold Spike? More like douche douche."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is amazing. Morgan helped us and she made sure we were good and was super friendly. Games are amazing. Cheap drinks.  Awesome"}
{"text":"Whatever time you're reading this- come. Super cool place to hang out and have fun. We showed up at around 2:30am Sunday morning- games are free to play. If you need darts or a fooseball table ball just ask the bartender inside they'll hand it right over. Seriously though whether you're going on a date, you're in from out of town, or looking to take your friends from out of town to a cool spot- this is it. There's beer pong for 2 players or up to 6 in regular sized tables. A pitcher of beer is 18 bucks and they give you 4 balls and lots of cups for free. They also have massive beer pong where you play with huge (clean) trash cans and a soccer ball.   Oh and no need to search for a place to grub after there's a 24 hour restaurant inside too! Chicken strips and fries were really good so was the pancake and chicken platter."}
{"text":"When I first heard of the Gold Spike, I knew absolutely nothing about it except that it was located downtown. I imagined this old school smokey casino full of elderly people spending their last pennies in the penny slots, so I was surprised that my friend wanted to go there so badly on Saturday night.  I could not be more incorrect.    The inside is a giant game room with giant sized games that include darts, connect four, corn hole (or bean bags for those of you not from the Midwest), shuffle board, etc. There is also a bar and what looks like a little restaurant.  Even though it's a giant game room, it still has a swanky feel to it.  Then there's a huge back patio area with more corn hole, a giant Jenga game, and chairs and little fire pits, as well as a stage for bands to play.    It's just such a great and fun atmosphere.  It's relaxing and not at all pretentious.  There's so much to do and the drinks are cheap.  My friends and I were all very excited to have found a new fun spot downtown.  We need more places like this!"}
{"text":"Had a great time thanks to Bethany , fun place great bartenders what more do you want , I have hung out all over Vegas from the double down to the foundation room. It's the bartenders that make or break a place . Don't believe me go check her out for yourself , you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Gold Spike recently on a Sunday night.  It was a good crowd and there were so many fun games to play.  Drinks were reasonably priced and we had several as our group played all night. DJ played great music and it was a super fun night.    Loved the backyard and especially the tiny house.  I would love to rent the tiny house sometime.  It is a little expensive.  If I could get 20% off, it would be a done deal.   Heading back in June.   I'll keep watching for deals.  Maybe, just maybe, I can find something."}
{"text":"This place is a riot. A downtown land mark. Always a great crowd. A amazing, fun staff, and so many things to do here unlike most bars. It's a playground for a adults. Great prices, music, games and food. Must go!!!!"}
{"text":"What a tremendous disappointment. Planned to spend our night out here. Called around 4:30pm & spoke with a manager to ask about when to arrive before cover charge and attire, etc. Was told 10pm cover charge begins. Made our way to this spot at 9:40, the bouncer rudely stopped me from entering and said I needed to go around to the main entrance. I said \"but it's not 10? I thought there was no cover prior to 10?\" He looked at me and said \"if you wanna have an attitude you can leave.\" I was so shocked by his abrupt rudeness. My husband grabbed my arm and wanted to leave. I really wanted my friends to see inside (I was here last summer in the day time) so I said \"well let's just go to the main door, surely they aren't charging yet just moving the line.\" When we moved to the other door it wasn't even open yet. We stood there as a different bouncer came out and told us to go back to the side door. ...We were very confused. Yet another bouncer appeared and said to 'stay in this line and wait until 10.'' He also states cover charge WOULD be taken. Again it was muttered \"if you don't like it then leave.\" We left. And won't return. The cover is only $10 which we would/could have paid, but the whole incident was so unprofessional I couldn't give my money to this establishment. Sad the security here are arrogant jerks & ruined the night being before it even got started!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Good music, great games, just a overall fun place to be!"}
{"text":"We came in last night, on a Sunday and had absolutely the best time!! Our Lyft driver had recommended we check it out and we were so happy we did. Drinks were two for one, and we had quite the selection of games to play. From carnival games to giant connect four, giant Jenga, shuffleboard, corn hole, beer pong and giant beer pong this is the place to have a fun night. Can't wait to go back on our next trip to Vegas. Wishing LA had something like this."}
{"text":"Awesome bar, it is basically an adults playground. They have everything from an operation game to giant jenga pieces...their drinks are typical bar prices but they make sure to pack in the alcohol...overall great place to hang out and have some drinks."}
{"text":"No chicken and waffles but, still a great a great place for a bite to keep you raging all night and plowing through the drinks with a fresh base of food. After eating and regaining composure, it's back to destroying  the dance floor and the local ladies."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong hanging out at Goldspike. Its a fun place to hang out with friends.  Theres a huge dance floor and bar inside with arcade games and the backyard is an adults playground with life size games. The restaurant inside has really good food. You must try the unicorn grill cheese at FiddleStix located inside the Goldspike. The best part about this place is is 24/7."}
{"text":"Always fun when you're with friends...beer pong & games were cool..not a bad place to chill at"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!! Great place to hang out with friends and play some jumbo sized games!"}
{"text":"Cool night cap bar! This is a chill casual place to play adult board games outside. Kinda gives me a bit of alice and wonderland maze vibe. This would be great for a big birthday party"}
{"text":"Such a fun lounge/bar in downtown Las Vegas! Usually when I come to Vegas I stick to the strip and go to clubs there, however, this place was amazing and so much fun! It is HUGE also.   They have a huge indoor area with a Dj, bar, games and pool tables. Outside they also have a Dj with a huge dance area and games like tether ball, 4 square, jumbo jenga, and jumbo beer pong. Such a good environment and the bartenders and workers are all super friendly! Lots of space to sit as well  The ambiance is casual and you don't have to worry about wearing heals or anything fancy. People were pleasant and the crowd was great! Definitely recommend going here if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The indoor atmosphere is s little weird but I like that there are plenty of places to sit and lounge. I like the outdoor area and the adult sized games. The bartenders are hit or miss. The restaurant is less than desirable."}
{"text":"Security is corrupt! Never going again. I used to go all the time in big groups. Was there Saturday night. A friend got stopped at the door by security because his clean white V-Neck is apparently \"gang affiliations\". He's a clean cut guy wearing a watch, nice shorts and boat shoes.   Security made him pay an extra $15 to go in, plus the $10 cover. They basically used their power to steal from him, making up fake excuses to pocket the money. I called management who doesn't seem to care or take his incident seriously.  Already told this story to 5 other friends that agree to never go back. I used to enjoy this place but will never give them another dime"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the brand spanking new Gold Spike.  Brought to you by The Downtown Project team and Zappos.com.  Since the grand opening, I have been back every single weekend...oh, and to no other location downtown!  That says a lot for me as I get bored with a place.  Nope, not with the Gold Spike.    Let's start off with the ambiance.  This place is a lounging paradise!  Comfortable, over sized lounge chairs everywhere.  They have a HUGE California King (or even bigger) in the middle of the joint, where you can sit down, have some drinks on, or lie on.  They also have high top tables and chairs if you prefer that as well. You can even bring your laptop and work.  They have free Wifi!!!!  And the greatest thing about the inside?  IT'S SMOKE FREE!!!!     Go outside and they have another lounge area with comfortable couches.  Need more?  They have lounge patio and cushions chairs all around the outside area.  Then, there's the airstream.  It's definitely at conversation starter. Recently, they installed a large golden statue of a cobra snake.  That was kind of odd.  I think the quirky books, trinkets, decorations and bed set this place apart from other downtown lounges.    The other thing that makes this place rock is the amount things you can do there.  Start with the jukebox and the photo booth by the bar.  Behind the photo booth, you have a couple of dart boards to enjoy with friends.  Then, there's the shuffleboard.  It's inside and super fun.  Next to it is the pool table and a HUGE corn hole game set up.  My favorite game!  You can always check out the board games they have behind the counter as well.  Go outside and there's another huge cornhole along with two normal sized corn hole games.  Lastly, they have the huge sized Jenga blocks.  That has to be the crowd favorite so far.  So much fun, but watch out!  Each block is heavy and will hurt your toes if it gets in the way.  What I appreciate is that within the Grill and the bar, they've kept a lot of the old Gold Spike employees.  I love the fact that they remember you if you frequent there.  Folks like Joe, Will, Jay and Heather behind the bar really makes this place feel like home.  OH, don't worry.  The drinks are really inexpensive as usual!  Trust me.  Such a great update to a downtown favorite.  Hands down, my favorite place at the moment.  I've fallen in love with this place all over again and I'm so happy this place exists downtown.  Come check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Gold spike was so much cooler last year. Now it's a bunch of ghetto ratchet people and a college reunion every weekend filled with underaged people. There's life sized beer pong, a dance floor, 4-square, and corn hole. The bouncers will literally let anyone in!! The drinks are pretty affordable and the layout is awesome. It used to be so fun but now it will just be a occasional downtown destination."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun! They have a few things to do indoors like corn hole, darts, foosball, and a dance floor but the real fun is outside! There's a bar & an area for live music. They had games outside like tetherball, four square, and even a life size beer pong game! This is a great place to have a drink and play some fun games with a group of friends."}
{"text":"So they took out all their gaming and relaunched themselves as a lounge. I'm not quite sure what happened to the hotel rooms and what they are used as now.   I came during the evening to check it out. It was really busy, really loud and lots of dumb drunken antics. There's a DJ playing and you can play too : shuffleboards, darts, billiards, board games, cornhole, etc. The plus is there's lots of space and abundant seating and couch beds to lounge on. There's outdoor areas as well with chairs and lawn games.   If you want something to eat, they have a diner in there. It's not much quiet since it opens up into the great room where everything is happening.   I'm sure I've missed more than it has to offer since it's a big place and I didn't go exploring more once me and my friends found a table.   I heard it's open during day and is a far different vibe. It's relaxed and quiet since it can attract the laptop set who need alternate place to work or study. I think that's more my speed.   I don't know if it's always that crowded, but it was a little too crowded for my taste with some rowdy people. It was good people watching though. Where else can I find a hipster in a suit sitting there zoned out with one shoe off?"}
{"text":"In my head I pictured senior citizens trolled in front of slot machines,  cigarettes in their mouth, walkers by their side, in their ritual one armed workout pulling the slot machine handle, giving the stink eye to anyone who dared take the machine next to them.   Nope... nothing at all of that sort could be found here. In fact no type of gambling within the building at all. And no nasty smoke smell.  Line wasn't long to get in. It is a 18 and ove venue.  When you step inside, there's a queen size bed almost directly in front of the entrance. It served as a spacer that separated the so called dance/game floor from the bar.  Located to the right when entering, the bar is square shaped and had 3 lighted  bar tables to the left of it that can seat up to 8 people each. Crowded little place, and the only thing keeping the under 21 guests was a \"21 and over only\" sign. Not too effective of a sign seeing as they did not card anyone ordering at the bar, and security was not checking. So yes, plenty of alcohol challenged teens running around.   On the other side of the bed to the left when entering is the game/lounge/dance floor. Against the outer wall were about 6 table lounge chair combos, in the middle was a mixture of medium and large love sacs and a toss game (sorta like horseshoe but with beanbags); several table lounge chair combos for that party of 4.  Came here last night on a triple date with 2 of my close girlfriends, so we sat at the larger lounge tables. Ambience was good, Dj was the worse. Just a couple of kids practicing around on the tables. Eventually it get better, or we were just getting more and more buzzed. (Drunk)  There was 2 pool tables next to us, 3 dartboards at the bar, a connect four on the back wall, and more games outside. V aping is allowed inside which is a big yay. Waitress are pretty slow, and the bartenders aren't any better. Constantly waving your hand as if your a high school student with the correct answer to the word problem on the board. Took about 15 minutes to get a Jack Daniel Tennessee Honey and budlight.   I do like the functionality of this venue. Ambience is good. Decor nice. Could use a new DJ. Customer service needs improving. It could be a one night thing for them, so we'll give them another chance to redeem themselves on that part. Overal, a good edition for hanging out in the fremont area. Needs more parking. I'm sure there is more but my memory hard drive was pretty much off the rest of the night. (WASTED)"}
{"text":"Gold spike is fantastic to chill, have a drink and play a game. Love giant Cornhole and beer pong! Bartender Brittany is amazing, super nice and has such a positive attitude, which at times can be rare in this city! Would love to see her working more often!"}
{"text":"We came here with friends after dinner to enjoy some games and drinks. I like the atmosphere. Laid back and chill. They have huge bean bags and couches. I was excited because they have games for grown ups but everything was either taken or broken :(. The dart board had no darts the connect four doesn't lock on the bottom so the pieces fall out and the Operation board is missing all the body parts. I recommend to to you Gold Spike that you fix the games so people can enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"Was here about 1 am on Fri/12 Dec for my buddy's b-day: - $200 for Ciroc bottle service (only had Peach flavor, though). - $12 for steak & eggs (we ordered 4 of these). - 18% gratuity added in, I guess because we had 8(?) people in our group. - Tab total came out to $296.53 = $200 bottle + $48 food + $44.64 gratuity + $3.89 tax.  And tipped $50 on top of that (oops, should have paid more attention to the receipt, but had my Ciroc glasses on.  Fortunately, made it back at Downtown Grand blackjack table). - Also, earlier in the evening (eg Thu night) had a Diet Coke at the bar, it was about $3.40(?) + tip. - Will definitely be back.  $200 for Ciroc bottle service and I can show up in a T-shirt and sneakers?  I'd rather do that then blow triple the amount on a/The Strip club bottle."}
{"text":"No parking. They have a parking lot but reserve the spaces for hotel guests only. What hotel guests?  Security is guarding an empty lot. Not cool."}
{"text":"I spent about a month and a half in downtown Las Vegas working with the Downtown Project. Naturally, each and every day was spent at Gold Spike, both in the Grill and Lounge area. I couldn't say better things.   Both April and Maria are wonderful waitresses. The food is great and incredibly affordable. Veggie wrap = a delight. The grill has a definite different allure than the rest of the place, very retro and diner-y. I'm not a hot sauce fan, but there's over 100 hot sauces to choose from, which my colleagues loved. All of the breakfast dishes are awesome as well.  Wifi works great."}
{"text":"I could not be more disappointed with the change over in the cafe. New chef in the cafe/diner has changed the menu and what used to be a hidden gem with solid portions and good variety is now boring and over priced. This place used to serve the most delicious chicken and waffles...not any more.   The waitress even commented that the new chef has changed the whole menu and a lot of regulars has stopped coming due to their disappointment. I tried the \"chicken and Pancakes\" (which isn't even a thing) but whatever. The chicken was a small flattened breast piece with a panko batter and the three pancakes were small and bland. The advertised \"jack Daniels maple syrup\" was and off brand, peel-off lid syrup like you'd get  at a drive-thru fast food joint. The mini portion of fruit was small cubes of watermelon and cantaloup that would fit in the palm of your hand.   The value isn't any better with the drinks either...$8.50 for a Bloody Mary that was blah at best.   Time to find a new spot..."}
{"text":"This is what a frat bro's house would look like if he had designed it for entertainment space. On the inside you have a bar, couches, chairs, lounges and even a couple giant beds. On the outside there's a live DJ playing and you have giant jenga, corn hole, ping pong tables, and even giant beer pong. Drinks are reasonably price and for some reason the last time I was there they had $4 Jamison. Can't really complain about that."}
{"text":"The Gold Spike is everything.  Anything you want in a bar, you can find here.    Pool tables, table tennis, darts, friendly bartenders, DJ, good music, conversation ,a back yard... FUN!  People have a good time at the Gold Spike.  And it is a place where diversity is welcome.  After 7 months living downtown Las Vegas, I finally made it to the Gold Spike today.  I was rewarded with good drinks, lively conversation and an outstanding experience.  I encourage everyone to go and experience this place, which is one of a kind.  A special shout-out to Fritz, who educated me on everything the Gold Spike has to offer.  Only the best bartenders understand how to facilitate conversation between patrons without seeming intrusive.  Fritz makes this seem like an art form.  Thanks man!"}
{"text":"So much fun!!! Like many of the reviews I agree this is like a grown up playground. Only thing it lacked is 4 square and a tether ball but other than that its got it all. Service was a little slow but the bar tender apologized immediately and thanked us for our patience. Decor is fantastic including interconnected handcuffs for the bar chains. Drinks are averaged price but a better beer selection than many other bars nearby. Overall I loved it and will be back my next visit to LV!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night  and it's just the vibe that's there too many hipsters just not my scene anymore the music was some hipster crap but it's cool I was just in a bad mood cause I remember you guys being so fun and all the games were on fire but now everyone just standing around talking about politics and what not , music should be poppin this place is so big no reason to only have one big area with only one sound going on,"}
{"text":"Honorable mention here is the staff.   Morgan, Monica, Lorenzo, Jake and Chef Mark...  These people make a difference...."}
{"text":"Awesome experience with the bartender! He is awesome!! Named Joe! I will Always come back if he's working!!!! Absolutely amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Nice facility...unresponsive to inquiries when I was ready to do an event there. We went elsewhere...guess they didn't need our business."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the better spots to drink in the downtown area. It's pretty packed during Friday/Saturday nights. Sure you can go there any other time of the week but you aren't going to catch anyone there. It has a great environment. They do have a cover charge on the weekend unless you are a female. I would come here with a group of friends given they have a shit ton of stuff to do in the back."}
{"text":"Been to Gold Spike several times last night was the first time we ate there.I've found it had to find Vegan food options in Vegas and was surprised to see several on their menu.  The portabella sandwich was so yummy!  All of my friends that ate as well were super happy with there food.  They also have a huge collection of hot sauces which my man was stoked to try.  Looking forward to eating there again soon!  Thanks Gold Spike Grill"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out and come with a group. It was my first time here and I loved it. Here is my take on the place.  Exterior: From the street there is really nothing that makes Gold Spike stand out from other small hotels and businesses downtown. There is a small parking lot connected to the building which I'm sure is for hotel guests and staff. There is also a large parking lot across the street which is owned by them also but the parking is not free and can get pricey from what I have been told.  Interior: The interior is modern and upscale, I love the changes they have made to the place. When you walk in there is a security booth to your left, a giant lounge bed and seating area in front of you, and a bar to your right. The security guards are just your average big guys off the street and do not look on the professional side, they are more for show than anything as there use of force will be limited, I know this as I do security. The lounge area looks amazing and is a fun place to chill with friends and play some games or just relax, and the bar I will get to later. There were a couple more secluded sections for those who want more privacy which added a nice touch. The bathrooms were spotless which I'm sure will make the people with germ phobias happy.  Outdoor Area: The outside area was where the majority of the fun was. There was a live DJ when I was there and lets not forget about the giant games. Giant Jenga, giant beer pong as seen in my photo, giant shuffleboard, some giant game I think is called corn hole, either way it was badass! I will be returning for the games alone and did I mention it is free to play them?!?  Bar: The bar was decent with a good selection of alcohol to choose from. Service was a little slow as they were packed with drunk businessmen telling stories about random crap and they only had two bartenders on hand. The reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the drinks were not worth the price, they came in kids size plastic cups (smaller than your average red cups), and I got charged for some other groups beer also and the bartender got upset when I wanted their tab returned to my card. Do I look like I buy drinks for random strangers?"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is a fun place to unwind and relax with friends. However, something that hasn't happened before but happens now is their dress code expectations and their charge for men at the door. It is ridiculous. I came here on a Friday night and they charged the guys in my group $20 at the front door and turned away a friend of mine because of his attire. He was wearing jeans with dress shoes and a regular shirt with a dressy business jacket. They said it was because he had a shirt on? But that wasn't an issue when my friends and I used to come in the past weekends. This place is on and off, they'll enforce rules but at the same time let some rules slide depending on your appearance at the moment. I just came in last week with a group of friends and a guy came in with a fake ID but still ended up getting in. There's three lines to stand in: guys, girls, and reserved. They have line separators to divide the three lines but there are so much people cutting and passing through the security with ease to get in. Securities let them! Idk if it's because they know them or are friends with them but that's unfair, you got a line of people waiting and depending on how a girl looks or if a guy could slide in money to the security you could get in Gold Spike without waiting. Now that they charge at the door their drinks are pricey (expected, of course!) but my guy friends would buy two cups of drinks that'll already be $14... so $14 for two drinks + $20 at the door for men = $34 total, only one hour into arriving at Gold Spike. Totally not worth it. Also, parking is non-existent, you must be willing to walk far away to get free/ affordable parking or you must pay a lot to find a parking up close. Upon entering Gold Spike go straight to hanging out outside, their games are fun and the environment out there is better than the inside."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the \"new\" Gold Spike.  Last time out, it was a run-down casino with little excitement inside.  Now, it's a nicely renovated gaming establishment.  By \"gaming\", I mean the bag toss games, giant chess & Jenga, etc.  No casino games that we could find.  That was a bit puzzling, but we accepted that soon after arriving.  The place wasn't crowded by any means, but all the games were occupied.  That created a very strange atmosphere.  What do you do there when all the games are taken up?  Belly up to strangers and declare \"I got next!\"?  Meh.  Sit at a table with a beer while you talk a game waiting for folks to leave?  Hmph.  This place has a lot of promise.  The concept is solid, but the execution needs to be worked on.  There's a lot of open space for people to mull around, but there's nothing to DO for those folks.  There could easily be some blackjack tables in areas, or some slot banks.  Clearly, gambling isn't a priority here.  And that's fine, but it feels strange.  More games (bags, shuffleboard, etc.) could get more people to stick around longer.  We hung around for one beer, a game of bags, then blew out of there.  The crowd tended to be more of the younger, \"hipster\" crowd.  Perhaps if that's your thing, you'd rate this higher.  I yearned for more availability, more fun, more action, and some excitement.  The band that was playing was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Gold Spike has been on my list for a while now, but I really never go to Fremont Street.  It took a friend proposing at the end of the Alibi show to get me down here, and I'm pretty glad I came.  First off, the bar: Meh.  Service was slow.  My fella and I stood there for 10 minutes while the (all males) bartenders took care of all the pretty girls (even ones who got to the bar after us) before looking around the bar blankly.  We had to say something to get his attention.   Drinks are expensive.  We paid $15 for two WELL Whiskey and cokes.  $7.50 a piece for a single?  Yikes.  Too rich for my blood.  I'm reminded why I don't come downtown often.  They have pool tables, and a ton of games available, which is really cool.  I enjoyed seeing everyone playing and having fun.    The reason for the third star was the food.  If the food hadn't been as good, my star rating would have been a solid two.    Service was slow, and pretty impersonal.   The French Dip was bland, and the hummus plate was a little small for $8.  The chicken tenders, however, were amazing.  Really...they were crunchy, and juicy, and NOT GREASY.  That's the biggest thing for me, I can't stand a greasy chicken tender. The chicken tenders and fries (which were great too) deserve a whole star on their own, and saved this from being a 2 star rating.  Will I come back?  Probably not, unless I'm already downtown...but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it, either."}
{"text":"This place is a super cool place to hang out while in downtown Vegas. They have lots of places to sit along with lots of comfy beds to hang out on! The vibe is pretty chill as I've never seen it super busy.  They have a bunch of games you can check out and place. They also have giant connect 4 on the wall.  There is a really neat back patio area where they have live music sometimes. They also have giant jenga, giant corn hole, and giant beer pong!   It's a really fun place to chill. Drinks aren't the best, but they'll do!"}
{"text":"I love that this place has multiple oversized games to play while decompressing with alcohol. I've been here quite a few times but my favorite memories made here happened during the day. Although there isn't live music, the place isn't as busy and we get to play all the games while we're there. The biggest plus is when they decided to add my all time favorite thing to do during recess as a kid...tetherball! The drinks are reasonably priced and usually on the stronger side than most bars."}
{"text":"Their security guards are on a power trip which were unnecessary. I know they're just doing their jobs but they can at least not talk to their customers like they own the place."}
{"text":"This is a really strange place. It's an open lobby area with a bar on one side and a large open area on the other with a bed, bean bags, high table tops and various other low couches. There are games peppered throughout this open area and young hipsters everywhere. Never have I seen so many twenty year-olds gathered in one big place like this before!   There's a DJ table with loud music playing but this isn't a place suited for dancing I don't think. If you are in your 20s you'll probably have a great time here just to hang out or to meet new friends. I ran into a few very cute and young 20(s) year old guys who stared at me with a way-too-friendly smile. Sorry little ones but I'm an old lady even if I might not look it."}
{"text":"Gold Spike is a playground for adults. Seriously, name any game and Gold Spike has it. From your typical bar staples like pool tables and dart boards, to more youthful games like life size Jenga and Connect 4, there's plenty of activities to choose from. I even spied a counter service check out where board games like Scrabble could be rented out! If you venture outside, there's more fun filled adventures waiting for you (like Hopscotch and Giant Beer Pong). There's usually a band playing outside, too.  What I really like about Gold Spike is that there's ample seating available. I'm tired of going into bars/clubs where seating is extremely limited. At Gold Spike, I'm almost guaranteed some sit-down time. I'm also a fan of the wide variety of social activities available to guests. It's pretty hard to get bored here!   4/5 for the Gold Spike venue/nightlife   Worth a Return Visit? Gold Spike is immensely popular with young crowds and especially locals. The vibe here reminds me of bars in Denver. Gold Spike is one of my favorite hangout spots in DTLV.   YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #22"}
{"text":"I love this place in downtown Las Vegas! Several games outside out back and even inside. There's something for everyone here. There's drinks, games and dancing :) I think during the winter there's even ice skating and several fire pits around :) cheap drinks too and no cover as well!"}
{"text":"When your Yelp elite cousin wouldn't stop ranting about going to downtown all for their life size beer pong & games... GO HERE! Between lounging, partying, & watching people play games, this is every fun adult playground!! We were fortunate to come here with the play area all to ourselves on a Sunday morning. I'm curious to see how this place is at night, which I'm sure gets packed!  * Service: They have security guards keeping a look out in case you're doing something \"crazy\". Whoops, they had the \"Life is Beautiful\" stand from the past music festival outside & I climbed it for the heck of a photo & was told to get down. The security guard we met though was super nice! He gave us a brief info on the spots that happen to be poppin at night. The service we received inside by the girl at the bar was super chill & served our drinks the way we wanted it.  * Outdoor playground: - Airstream - Tiny house  - life size beerpong  - dodgeball - jumbo jenga - beerpong tables  - twister - sandbags - life size chess  All are fun while getting a snack or drink from the bar inside! We were having fun playing with it all because no one else was out with us.   * Inside: - Cafe - Full bar - bed & movie-like seats in front of a big screen tv - board games - games   I highly recommend going here if you're looking for something to do in Vegas other than be on the strip, shop, & drink. This place has just about everything that will give you a good time!"}
{"text":"My friend living in Vegas suggested this spot to us and met him and a few of his friends over there. It's basically an adult playground with giant beer pong, chess, & jenga, ping pong tables, darts, you name it. Really chill spot with lots to do. Would probably go back though when I'm with my bestfriends to make the experience more worthwhile."}
{"text":"So i went here with a friend over the weekend. But i am DEFINATELY a fan! Cover is $10 bucks to get in and free for the ladies. Unfortunately i walked in with a White tee and it was against their policy but the guy at the door let me in.   Walked in and there was a dancing in the lobby already with pool tables and a nice center bar and lots of things for everyone to do. what impressed me was the back area with the Big games , Outdoor chess, Corn Hole, Jenga, and HUGE BEER pong. The crowd was chill and everyone seemed friendly. Looks like Security was on point but overall we enjoyed it.   There was a little something for everyone, whether you wanted to dance, chill, or be active playing drinking games. I would definitely come back here and avoid the over crowded upscale clubs."}
{"text":"The first time I went to gold spike I had a good time with my friends. That was about a week ago. I went back this week for Memorial Day weekend. Once I got up the line to the bouncer they scanned my ID and took a picture of my face. They told me I could not enter because my ID apparently did not look like me. I asked how it didn't look like me.. and he rudely said the girl in the ID picture has a slimmer face then yours and has a different hair color. I felt very insulted. Yes my I'd picture was taken 4 years ago when I was 19 and I have recently changed my hair color. But just because I have gained weight in the last years and had make up on tonight with a different hair color apparently that's reason to believe that my ID is not mine. Even tho it scanned and they knew it was a valid ID and it had worked just fine the week before when I had last gone in there. I'm not upset about not being able to go. I left and went to a different bar and enjoyed my Saturday night off. I'm just upset about the reasoning behind it and the way the bouncer handled it and the comments that where made about my appearance. It was just plain rude..."}
{"text":"This place is like a playground for adults. It has pretty much everything from pool to life size beer pong. It does get a little crowded but that's what happens in a bar in Las Vegas. Never a long line to get in. Also I am a girl and the lone for the bathroom is a bit ridiculous at times but once again that's every woman's bathroom. It's also a good place if you're looking for more of a \"younger crowd\".  All around this place is awesome and it's always fun to hang out at."}
{"text":"Erase whatever preconceived notions you had about the Gold Spike. I always thought of it as a run down, old casino with a shitty, yet awesome $4.99 steak and egg breakfast.  On Monday night, friends requested that I join them down there and I am extremely grateful I did. The entire space has been cleaned out and modernly decorated. I entered a giant man cave. This is a large, open space with large games everywhere, a back patio, a bar, and a cafe. It's all non-smoking (which I learned the hard way by lighting up at the bar, but the staff was completely cool about it).   There are several large versions of Connect 4, Shuffleboard, and Bean Bag Toss. There are several pool tables and a large Jenga game outside. There is plenty of lounge seating inside and on the back patio. There is also a little booth were you can borrow board games like Clue, Monopoly, etc.  There are large beds with plush pillows and giant bean bag chairs. The tables have large books full of art and history.  It's a beautiful and open space. The best part, all of these games are 100% free. This place delivers so much fun and happiness. What a wonderful concept! Brought to Las Vegas from Zappos.com and the Downtown Project.  The drinks are inexpensive and they offer gluten free and organic bottled beers. The bar area is the only place in which underage patrons aren't permitted. Such a great place for those teetering between the 20-21 years of age. Best of both worlds.  The Gold Spike is a wonderful addition to downtown and offers fun for the whole family without hurting your pocket. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on going to this \"Good-luck on your new job\" party but O.M.G--- I'm glad I did! I'm not much for drinking (in public) since I wore out my \"inebriated welcome\" in college. So with much partying out of my system I don't look forward to loud music, large crowds and wild daubachary. When I got there, the place reminded me of a much subtle DAVE & BUSTERS. Who plays school-yard games while drunk?!  Rarely giving into peer pressure I decided to sip on something to get my friends off my back. One straight coca-cola turned into rum & coke, a few fireball whisky shots, 7 & 7's, and various other drinks from slick male friends saying \"Hey, Oona. Try this!\", and I was feeling pretty good....  Buzzed and winning at a game that involved sand bags, holes and much focused concentration I ran into a stranger with a jar of maraschino cherries. After making the stupid cherry joke from the movie Grease, I let her put one in my mouth. WTF?! Why would would I take candy from a stranger? Not only that, who know's where her hands have been?! Within a few minutes I felt really wierd. ---Like I had 3 back to back shots! Was I being roofied? I told my friends I didn't feel well...well, I wasn't feeling bad either.   Feeling like I was about to black out and be date raped later on that evening, I had to at least know what to tell the police the next morning, so I asked nonchalantly, \"So, uhh...what was in those cherries?\"  Her boyfriend admitted that they were soaked in MOONSHINE! WTF?! I didn't care that I could possibly black out and be violated, I just cared that it's not regulated by the health department! Holy crap! Isn't that stuff made in people's bath tub?!  Next thing I know, she dumps the cherries on the ground and walks away! Why would she do that?! Is she destroying evidence?   I got super paranoid and all of my friends begin to stand around me and ask me if I was ok, and then taunted me about how I wasn't going to be able to pass my annual drug test at work. I took a picture of the cherries as evidence just in case my urine came up dirty so I could point to the picture and say, \"I SWEAR! I DON'T DO DRUGS--LOOK!\"  After about an hour I started to feel a little better and stopped taking shots. What time is it? One thing about Gold Spike is there is no concept of time. I'm a person that's in bed by 8pm so I'm used to going places where the later it gets, the less people you see! Here--it was the opposite. It was 3am and the place was PACKED. After random guys started circling my seat, looking like they were going to ask me for the \"digits\" I decided it was time to go. It was now approaching 4am! Where did the time go?! I could have continued this adventure by going with my coworkers to get breakfast, but all I kept thinking was the last thing I wanted to Yelp about next was how I barfed my scrambled eggs.  Overall I haven't had THIS MUCH fun in a really long time. I laughed hard, played hard like I was at recess in grade school, and drank hard like I was back in college.  I will definitely come back to Gold Spike again. It was a good time.   P.S. Thank God, I woke up in my own bed, un-roofied!"}
{"text":"Great bar in a great city. Went out there this last Saturday night. Huge games, great decor, expensive drinks(vegas!) bartenders knew there stuff and from what the wife said they were strong but tasty. Downtown vegas is thriving and this is just another option, I would make a point to come check it out if your in the neighborhood. If I could come up with something bad to say it would be that the bathroom lines where long at times but that's just a bar that's doing great business. Happy partying. Cheers"}
{"text":"The environment and staff of this place on first Friday is extremely cheap and unfriendly!!! stay away to avoid being treated wrongfully and disrespected!"}
{"text":"I always thought of this place as the go-to meetup spot at night because it's iconic. The back patio is actually pretty nice. Now, I understand people getting kicked out for causing a ruckus and being extremely belligerent (they SHOULD get kicked out).  But both consecutive times, security kicked out my friends for very ODD reasons.  The first time was back in January 2016. We were sitting down chilling with our drinks. One of my friends was sitting down with us, but he was just to the side, not really interacting because he's a pretty reserved guy. Security came up to him telling him \"You need to leave\" without any explanation. What??? Kicking him out because he's not doing anything? OK............... [Insert Waka Flocka meme here].   The second time was recent (5/18/2018). One of my friends was told by security to leave because \"she looked lost and was wandering around.\" UMMM WHAT??? It seems like Gold Spike is yearning for people to be surrounded and interactive with other people, and for what? You can't let someone just go to the bathroom by themselves????? LOL [Insert blinking white guy gif here].  If you want to come here, you need to babysit your friends. Don't let them look lonely, and don't let them wander around. Don't let them go to the bathroom by themselves. They're not only concerned about belligerent people; they apparently see people who can't find the bathroom by themselves a threat as well.  If this establishment wants to kick out people for certain behavior, they should post the standards of conduct in a public area. I'm trying to look for it on their website, and I see nothing. If you look at all their low-rated reviews, most of them are about situations with security.   Besides that, overpriced drinks & food, weird music until midnight, and just strange vibes all around. I am never coming here and spending money here again.   Tip: Go to Commonwealth and Inspire instead. :) Both have rooftop bars and play amazing music!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a good time in Downtown Las Vegas you need to come here. They always have great live entertainment, great beer, and any drink you can imagine. The party is always lit here weather people want to dance and drink, or if they want to socialize and play their larger then life games. The games range from oversized corn hole, to beer pong, to Jenga, and even 4 square. You can feel like a big kid in a play ground when you are here."}
{"text":"I have never seen the pre-renovation so I have only seen the post-renovation and WOW!  It is modern, fun, entertaining, clean, relaxing, & that feeling where I am at a big house party.  I loved that they have this huge california king sized bed in the middle of their lounge area.  They had a place where you can sitdown, I loved their games that they have all over the area.  It kind of brought me back to childhood memories, they had hop-scotch, they had connect four, etc.  We went there on a Firday night and wow was it packed! It was a very mix crowd and they even had a dj playing at his booth.  Great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing hang out spot. Now that Downtown Project Group has moved in to clear out the gaming, they have turned it into the ultimate lounge. It is all self contained as well. With the Grill and bar close by, the guest will never go hungry or thirsty.  Those conveniences leaves me more time to play darts, both kinds of shuffleboard, billiards, the corn hole game, large jenga, board games, or even beer pong in the backyard. Do you need a place to lounge and red Fifty Shades of Grey? You are in luck. The bed, near the bar, has a copy of it and you are more than welcome to get a group of friends to have story time."}
{"text":"Definitely a local favorite bar downtown! It's always packed on the weekends so come early or you will be waiting in line all night. They always have the best music playing that you can really dance too, on certain nights they even have live music! This bar definitely is unique in the sense of their gaming theme, it's just a place you can shoot back some drinks, play some games, dance all night and totally vibe with the people there! Drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders are super talkative and friendly not to mention hot af too ;) if your visiting Vegas make sure you check them out it's worth a night!"}
{"text":"This place is always my sister's go-to nightlife spot, and I can see why. Ladies get in free ($10 for guys), multiple bars, and plenty of games to play. The music isn't always my favorite but the environment is great. It's fun and invites you to interact with others."}
{"text":"Great Food, good drinks,  and fun times!  They did a great job remodeling the Gold Spike!  This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. They have a gigantic bed that is really fun to lounge on and 5 super big been bags and tons of games. They even now have these cabins they built in the back that you can rent if you like and it is next to the only PLEXI GLASS Skating rink I've ever seen. Everyone that works there all the way down to the security guards are super friendly. It is clear that the owners and/or managers have a cool outlook on things and have made a point to make everything (about going to the GoldSpike) great."}
{"text":"Stayed in Gold Spike tower. They remodled an old downtown hotel to try to make it a trendy boutique hotel. Well a coat of paint and cheap artwork is what you get. My room door lock didnt work, the toilet didnt flush either. Downstairs turns into a nightclub every night and the next morning there is drinks spilled all over the floor.  Now for the real pain in the ass...  in order to get into the hotel at night you have to go through the main front door which turns into the nightclub front door and the line is wrapped around the building so you have to wait in the line just to get into your hotel room. After a long day this is not what I need.  Resort Fee... I found a coupon online for $29/nite weekday. Get to the hotel and they tell me there is an additional $25/nite resort fee!  Its a fun hotel and great location plus you get free parking."}
{"text":"This place is so great I'm planning a wedding rehearsal dinner here. Ask for Joe, he's the man!!"}
{"text":"Being a local we came here last night on Halloween to chill since we didn't want to deal with the craziness of the strip or even Fremont St. The place is clean with reasonable drink prices and human size games which is a nice twist.  We got there around 9:30 and was able to find some seats in the backyard patio which was nice because there was a live band and a bar outside. Besides that we had 2 waitresses serving us so that was pretty cool to not even have to leave our seats. Around midnight a staff member named GiGi approaches us to let us know that we were sitting in a VIP area and if we wanted to stay there we would have to pay $600 for bottle service. I told her that we've been there for hours and have probably bought 8 rounds of drinks without the servers ever mentioning to us that we were in a VIP area. Her excuse was the waitresses were \"NEW\"and didn't know. I'm sorry but that is not our problem when you can not train your staff properly, you don't have any reserve signs, nor is the area sectioned off with a velvet rope or security, and on one of your busiest nights of the year your staff does not know where the VIP section is.  GiGi thank you for ruining our night. If we had known before we had already bought all those drinks through your waitresses and at the bar this review might have been more  pleasant. We went there to get away from the lines and bottle service bs. Plus no where else in the whole damn place did I see bottle service.  Update: Some of my  friends stayed and said no one sat in their \"VIP\" area at all that night. If you didn't try to force bottle service on us we would have spent more $$$$. Oh well maybe you'll be more prepared next year and train your staff properly."}
{"text":"Went down to gold spike for my first time and I was greeted by Gio, Ken, and Sarge. Great service those guys had answered any questions I had about the place and were polite. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Moved away from KC a few years ago and when I come back I always go to Jack Stack and rosedales.   A friend told me to try Q39.    Unbelievable BBQ.  DO NOT miss going there.   Beats Jack stack and Joes.  Great value for the $$.   Jack Stack keeps raising their prices."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it less than one star.... bartenders are so rude. It took forever to get a drink and they were not nice what so ever. We were trying to celebrate a 21st birthday keep the vibes positive and we were not impressed.... there's a bunch of lounges around I suggest you try another..."}
{"text":"This place is the best! The drinks are reasonable prices, the games are super fun, and the atmosphere is amazing. The restaurant in there has great food too! Perfect for sobering up :) such a diverse group of people, good music, always a good time!"}
{"text":"So this is like a playground for adults!  Imagine a bar that's loaded with crazy games inside and out. They have everything you can imagine: billiards, ping pong, corn hole, SUPER HUGE corn hole (picture attached), HUGE chess. The Best for last, HUGE beer pong that you play with a volleyball!!!! There is bar service both inside and outside with plenty of room for a good time. We went with 12 guys and played almost everything. This place is perfect since all 12 of us did not have to stay together, but could easily find each other.  I think this place is perfect for a birthday or bachelor / bachelorette party! You have room for everyone you came with and plenty of chances to meet new people. There is even a stage, so I guess they have live music sometimes."}
{"text":"We had a good time playing the giant beer pong and corn hole last night. However, I think there needs to be a whiteboard or a chalkboard to sign up for games or something along those lines.   Too many people trying to keep the games to themselves for far too long and quite a few knuckleheads in attendance last night.  What do you mean there's no smoking in the bar? Yeah, ya can't smoke here."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. They have many games to play which can easily keep you entertained on a slow night.  The selection of beers is almost endless with some really interesting craft beers. It was a little expensive for my taste but you are downtown and they have good specials I wasn't there for. Its an awesome place to socialize and get to know new people. Really enjoyed the furniture and decor as well. Everything about this place will have you saying, \"wow that's cool!\""}
{"text":"everything about the bar and lounge was 5 stars but the STAFF ARE KINDA THE WORST and think they are above everything. the white lady who was working the front with her ipad looking mighty cool on May 12 was the fckin worst. she literally refused to let me go to mine or my dads room which i had to go thru the club to get to. She had MAJOR attitude as if she wanted her customers to leave and didn't want people to support the business. if you see my name on my room number why can't i go to my room? because you hate your job and the people who spend money to generate your job? i ended up walking away and just going the long way to my room. i hope that old white lady didn't ruin anyone else's fun. i'd come back if she wasn't there"}
{"text":"I bought some food. I bought some drinks. My girlfriend decided to rest on the bench. They did not give me one verbal warning until they kicked my girlfriend out. They just told her to stand herself up and that is it. Once they grabbed my girlfriend, I yelled at them to drop her down. They did not and proceeded to bring her to the exit. She was not drunk, by the way, she was just very sleepy. She immediately followed orders, but still was physically abused and picked up. I left a phone call about the complaint and talked to one of your staff about it when i went back inside. The same person pushed me until I was out even though I was not speaking with him. I am very frustrated and abused and will not be doing any pleasure or business with this facility."}
{"text":"Good vibes. Stayed at oasis. Bar is awesome/ friendly and the food is reliable and delicious the couple times I went."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Can't believe we just discovered this place. Great place to get some work done, play games with friends and drink beer. Thanks to Angelina, our service was amazing!!! She was wonderful and checked on us the whole time. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Awesome idea for a bar with giant games we used to play as kids!  It's a fun change from all the slot machines and roulette tables.  Friendly staff with happy attitudes that add to the experience.  Saturday nights are my favorite days to go - Live music!  Sometimes they have bands from Hawaii, which really brings out the nostalgia for those who now call the \"9th Island\" home.  The food and prices are pretty descent considering it's bar food.  The only con to this place is that they have a tiny parking lot and limited street parking.  But the fact that they even have a FREE parking lot is a plus!  If you can't find parking here, you can always park at a nearby casino.  If you wanna have fun in a chill environment, this is the place.  I'm definitely taking my friends here when they come to town!"}
{"text":"Not an especially attractive crowd.  I was with a big group and we entertained ourselves for hours.   Bartenders were good.  I stepped outside for a moment to say goodbye to my friends and they wanted me to go wait to get back in, and then pay,  just to close out my tab.  The outside staff,  or maybe it was their instructions,  didn't sit well with me at all. The door girl especially was insulting.  I won't go back.  Too many better places in the area."}
{"text":"Great service from our bartender Alejandra, she makes greats shots. Super dope place to have drinks and play games!"}
{"text":"Lame! Sat there at the bar for over 10 minutes and no service. At least I got to take a leak."}
{"text":"Awesome service and they had so many games :) Jessica was an awesome hostess! She was super helpful and really nice! Love her! If you find yourself near the Fremont make sure you stop by!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to unleash your inner kid. Gold spike is definitely my favorite bar in Downtown LV. Not only is it a lounge/bar it is also a GIANT adult playground. There are a variety of games like 4 square, weather ball, giant chess, twister, corn hole, darts among others.   You have the option of being inside or outside there are multiple DJ's and sometimes local bands. Drinks are reasonably priced especially if you compare the prices from the Strip.   Attire is pretty casual which makes I think makes it better than the bars on the strip. People are there to genuinely have let loose and have good time."}
{"text":"hmm what an interesting playground for em big kids...   so unlike your typical vegas scene, this is much more laid back and relaxed atmosphere with just.. the W/E! vibe~ the pros about this place is that it's huuuuge! super spacious! with a backyard! i hate it when you go to a bar/club and people get all up on your grill... no bueno.. the 2nd best thing about this place is the $! thank goodness, they serve normal people drinks at normal people prices!  it is ridiculous how much clubs on the strip will charge their customers for a beer or just a splash of water.. for that, gold spike gets another star in my book~  so the place is very chill to be-- the music does get quite loud so it isn't exactly somewhere to go to have an intimate conversation... but my crew and i had a blast here the first night on our trip~ i recommend it if you're just looking to enjoy more of a chill night."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! It gets pretty packed and the waters they charge for are tiny. But the drinks are good, the people were cool and the hookah was always being checked on. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is interesting. From the perspective of an adult that is really a big kid at heart, it's right up my alley. When you walk in, the atmosphere is super chill. There is a bar on one side, and pool tales, a sitting section, game rental (games like Clue, Scrabble, etc) in the back, and a giant bed. Yes, you heard me right, a giant bed, smack dab in the middle of the place. It's actually quite comfy too, to be honest.   Anywho, there is a wide variety of things to do at the place, ranging from tic-tac-toe, to giant beer pong. (Beer pong that uses barrels and basketballs.) Luckily, no beer is in the actual barrels. Ew. Anyway, there is a vast variety of things to do there and while you are sober, it can be pretty fun for an hour or two. I imagine if you were drinking it would be even funner, but the downside is, like everything in the Freemont area, drinks are expensive. A beer can cost 6 dollars and I don't even want to know what actual liquor costs. I also went during the middle of the day (around 3:00 p.m.) so there wasn't a large amount of people there. I imagine it can get pretty packed, but the place is fairly large and has an outdoor area complete with more lounge sofas. They are also comfortable, just like the bed.   For those of you who want to ice skate, there is also a skating rink there, which is $5 dollars a person. I can't speak for their cafeteria, since I didn't eat there."}
{"text":"If you have a group of friends and want to watch the game, drink together in comfort, or, as we did, play cards against humanities, this is a great place to do it so long as you don't try to go on a friday or saturday night when it is packed.  They have various couches (even two beds), chairs, and booths that will fit a group of any size. Outside they have giant jenga and other games while inside they have cornhole (yes, bean bag toss has a new name) a bar and a small restaurant which  serves tasty snacks. No it won't win any culinary awards but it was better than expected."}
{"text":"Some friends raved when this business, acquired by Tony Hsieh's Downtown Project, re-opened without the casino but with a bar, large lounge area I guess which is for Downtown Project-bots, and a grill. The grill is what I was interested in. My colleague and I went there for lunch. There were a couple of problems. I ordered a cheeseburger, my friend a hamburger, both with fries.  It took about 20 minutes to be served, and that's a long time for a greasy spoon type joint to get the food to your table. Also, my cheeseburger (and the lettuce to go with) was sitting for about five minutes under a heat lamp. Why it takes longer to cook a hamburger than a cheeseburger, I don't know. My friend asked for mayo on the side. The mayo sat under a heat lamp for several minutes. I asked for the special sauce, which was promoted on the menu but for some reason wasn't on our sandwiches. The waitron told us there was no \"special sauce.\" (Double-checked - it was on the menu, not our burgers, though.) Also, the menu promoted the Parmesan buns. There weren't any Parmesan buns that we could discern. And I also asked for a pickle. My colleague got a pickle, but I didn't. I like pickles.  These extraordinary requests sent the diner into some sort of tailspin. Our waitron was diverted by some complicated stock transactions or some such and couldn't find a pickle, the side of mayo slowly warming under the heat lamps, or the missing special sauce that she says doesn't exist, so I asked another waitron for those items.  Go forward another five minutes, and the replacement waitron delivered a pickle and the side of mayo. The burgers themselves, cooked medium, were fine, as were the steak fries. Still, 90 minutes at this place and two screwed up orders - well, one very screwed up order at least - was too much."}
{"text":"Best 18.00 prime rib out the huge servings I always need to take home for later we always hit the Gold Spike whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"We came here for my 21st birthday, and not only was it one of the coolest places we had ever been, but we had exceptional service. We had a blast playing Giant Cornhole, using the photobooth, and the food was awesome too!!!!    ANNEMARIE was our waitress and she was phenomenal to say the least.... we were a party of about 40 people and she remembered everyone's names.... she went above and completely beyond what was expected of her. She impressively dealt with our sarcasm and threw some back. We were so darn lucky to have had her as our waitress... and anyone else would be too!!! She definitely made our experience what it was!!!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says this place is Top 3 bars I have ever been to.  So much to do its ridiculous!  I have never had the food just the spirits and the games but my experience here has been nothing but awesome!  Over sized Beer pong, Giant Connect four, corn hole big and small, ping pong, four square like in middle school plus the drinks makes for a great time.  I have been coming here since 2013.  There is only a few set backs; Parking is a b****, The games get crowded at night. Besides that I think this place is Awesome!  PS.... LOTS OF HIPSTERS"}
{"text":"Downtown is a place for bar hoppin. Their main bar that everyone goes to to Turn up is Gold spike Becuase of their live dj and dance floor plus the games they have. I go to place to just have fun with some friends. I ordere a pitcher of beer which was about $18 to play beer pong with not bad of a price. Came here on a weekday so it was a slow day. The cost to enter for guys was free. I forgot how much it was for weekend entry fee. I believe it's $10?? It's Becuase of the Dj that's why. Cool place to chill and have some oxtail soup around the corner at California hotel after getting drunk. Lol the only Cons is paying for parking *Boooo!"}
{"text":"I came here while in town for a wedding last month. We had a blast! Very cool and laid back atmosphere, with lots of fun over-sized children's games (jenga, beanbag toss, hopscotch, etc), pool tables, and bar. There's also a restaurant that was open late inside. A very cool treat for any 20/30-somethings looking for something different to do in Vegas. I will definitely go back the next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had an event for work and this place was just so much. Our waiter Angelina was just fabulous. She went above and beyond her job to make sure our rather large group was all taken care of."}
{"text":"If you have any self respect, do not stay here. My partner was physically attacked by security here. Spoke to the manager, only to be informed that the security isn't employed by the hotel. A police report will be filed as the assault was unwarranted. They will not release video footage to us as they know they're in the wrong. The security has been seen conversing with some shady looking guys as they stare us down.  I DEFINITELY do NOT FEEL SAFE HERE! Checking out immediately.   It's so sad to see that interracial relationships are still treated with such disrespect. 'Some people need to be taught a lesson, in special ways.' Is what he heard before he was assaulted from behind. Wth?!   The management change and all of these cute games won't fool us anymore. This place is dangerous, floors are filthy (I took a shower and walked from the bathroom to my bed and my feet were black, that's another story) and there's is no customer service.  I used to visit this place twice a year until I started traveling abroad. It's been 3 years and this is what I'm welcomed back with?!  No. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I was staying at the Oasis which is attached to Gold Spike. I popped in to Gold Spike for a quick bite to eat and a beer. Glad I did because it's a rather cool little hangout. The Gold Spike has obviously been recently renovated and has a very modern lounge feel. It's essentially a giant great room with a couple bars and some comfortable seating. This place is dark and intimate and just has a good, fun vibe. The first thing I saw upon entering were some bar goers playing a game of Bean Bag Toss. The food from their small restaurant wasn't tremendous but it was decent. If nothing else its a very convenient place to eat, especially if you're hanging at the bar all night. The one downside, the beer isn't cheap. A glass of Blue Moon was $8 or so. I might expect that on the strip but seems pricey for the Fremont Street area."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. One stop shop for a guaranteed good night. I haven't had the opportunity to come here on a weekend night yet but I've come by for a couple of happy hours and it's always a good time!  Cheap drafts, great wells, and solid food. But the best part are the games and lounging areas! They have over-sized corn hole, pool tables, outdoor seating, huge bean bag chairs, luxurious couches, huge shuffleboard, life-size connect 4, and during the day it's an open work space!   Seriously, just a fun place to come with friends and/or strangers to have a great night. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with this place! I would love to open something like this where I live. It felt like we were in adult recess and if it were up to me we would have spent every day and night there! We are there for breakfast and lunch and both meals were enjoyed by everyone we were with. If I ever go back to Vegas I will be spending every night there!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to meet up, plenty to do, and entertain eachother."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere fun, this place is not it. I would give it zero stars if I could. Bouncers and workers are super rude, ladies still have to pay to get in, the music sucks, it's dirty, just do not go here. It'll be a waste of your time and money. I'm usually not a hard person to please, but needless to say, I will never come back to gold spike again."}
{"text":"I walked in here with no idea as to what it was and what it looked like except that it was renovated from a hotel and there are apparently life-sized games.  My first impression was that Gold Spike is HUGE! There is so much space and plenty of room to walk around, mostly because it was a Wednesday night. We literally just walked in and explored. There's shuffleboard, this ball-tossy game thing (multiple stations), foosball, life-sized connect for, life-sized jenga outside, darts, 2 pool tables, and a little ice skating rink outside as well. There's also a random room with neon everything and a blacklight that makes everything glow. I don't really understand the point of that but it was fun to look at with 3D glasses none-the-less.  The drinks are so affordable compared to most other places and since it wasn't busy, we didn't have to wait. I imagine it would take a while on the weekends, though.  There's a huge cushioned bed near the entrance and several clusters of comfortable seating, including giant beanbags!  My favorite area was probably outside because of the fire pits, life-sized jenga, and random giant golden snake statue. I can definitely see myself hanging out with friends when it gets warmer out! Be careful of the jenga though - it has splinters.  Sorry my review is a little unorganized. This was basically my thought process when I was there all \"Ooh look at this!\" \"Ooh look at that!\" and \"Let's go play outside!\" Gold Spike is basically an adult's Chuck E. Cheese.  There is also a little cafeteria which apparently has good and affordable food, which I haven't tried. I'll be sure to try it next time! Apparently, the weekends have a dance floor opened up and some pretty good DJ's so I'll be sure to come check it out then as well."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking cliche....  I mean, at first it was a great idea.  I like the concept, don't get me wrong.  But now that every d-bag this side of the Colorado River has made it their weekend hangout - No thanks!  Service was slow, drinks were overpriced and the place was WAY too packed.  I love board games - but it was so crowded that you couldn't get near any of the games.  When we tried to inquire about playing a game of cornhole, nobody (even the security guard) knew how we could do that.  There was a live band, which was cool.  I am glad that they don't charge a cover, otherwise I would've really felt ripped off.  Also - I am not sure if there is more than 1 bathroom, but the one I used was far too small for such a large space.  I think there were only 4 stalls and the line was out of control."}
{"text":"Love the Pre-tech days of Silicon valley vibe - Great Bar, Amazing activities and Great Atmosphere - Love the Diner, Ice Skate in The Winter and outdoor games in the spring - Downtown has a gem that must be experienced!"}
{"text":"I woulda never expected a place like this in Sin City. In fact, if it weren't for a friend we wouldn't of known of this place.   Super relax, place is similar to a lounge.  Open area, large bar, ice rink (say waaaa'?), fire pits throughout the back area, life size Janga... Man, I can really dig this place.  Gold Spike also has their own parking lot so that's a plus.    I know where I'll be next time I visit."}
{"text":"My review is based on their food and food service... In the food area, Gold Spike has failed. On a Friday evening at 7, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food and the place was not busy. The onion rings were cold, the Philly cheesesteak was cold (the cheese didn't even pull apart that's how cold the sandwich was) and the chicken wings were warm. We also ordered a bacon ranch burger, which was just a burger, because there was no hint of ranch anywhere on the burger. Great place to mingle and hang out with friends, just eat somewhere else :("}
{"text":"Facts:  -It's usually crowded Friday through Sunday -On said nights it's really hard to get a drink at the main bar -Tons of different games to play like a 3-5 ft tall jenga and connect 4, skating, board games, darts, etc etc -There's a cover for guys AND girls on the weekends (Not a fan of that) -The bathrooms aren't always the cleanest and the wait is usually long -Drinks aren't bad"}
{"text":"Great to see yet another bar sell out and try and be a club on the strip! Really disappointed. Charging at the front for guys, well guess your bar tenders are just going to have to take a tip cut. Just sucks when you're born and raised here and slowly each local bar turns into a money hungry tourist attraction."}
{"text":"This was great atmosphere,fiddlestix food was great, the club was awesome,room service was great I will be back"}
{"text":"Security are jerks. Stupid parking meter only let me pay for 1.5 hour so I was leaving to go add more time and they wouldn't give us a stamp cause they supposedly stamp when we pay. Then they were like they didn't pay get them out of here. Wtf. I paid. Rude. Just cause they dont remember. Then they were like what was the security wearing. Black just like all the other security."}
{"text":"Dopeness.   This place is in the downtown area, the drive from the strip is so 90's, rumor has it that if you bump some Tupac you might see his ghost.  Parking is a hassle, their lot is limited, there are some in the blocks surrounding it, but of course no travelators here, so prepare to trek.  As soon as you walk in you feel real comfortable, you feel that local's spot vibe. The service reflects that. Bar to the right, don't hesitate for your home priced liquor.   Pool, jumbo connect 4, trash can sized beer pong, corn hole and other things I missed. This place is a good time killer and affordable if you didn't have probability on your side during your trip.   I did not eat here, because why would you?   It's pretty black and white, but the fun can color up your night."}
{"text":"Just went to the grill here and our presence wasn't even acknowledged. They weren't even busy. We walked up the hostess said have a seat-didn't offer any menus or a warm welcome. And after sitting for about 5 minutes w/out being serviced we decided maybe sitting at the counter may be a better option. We sat down and again there were at least 2 servers and a busser still no hello or a menu. Made eye contact with the cooks-still nothing. So after about another 7 minutes we decided to leave. How hard is it to greet someone and you WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY? Just flat out rude. I went there b/c I was in the area and the yelp reviews. Never again!"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is this little off-strip casino that I never would have thought to go to. It's down off of Fremont St. near the Mob Museum. No street parking so you'll have to park elsewhere and walk there, which isn't too bad.   The inside is obviously completely remodeled. They have a bar area, a \"living room\" area to hang out in, and the backyard area. Security guards check IDs and hover around a lot, not surprising since not that long ago this area was pretty seedy. Bar staff is pretty incompetent. Been there twice and both times the bartenders weren't paying attention and rang in something wrong, didn't even look me in the eye to take my order, and it wasn't even a super busy time to be there.   The living room area is interesting. There's tables, a giant cornhole game in the middle, fooseball, pool table, and a Games area that has lots of board games under lock and key. You can rent them for free if you give them your ID, but NOBODY is ever there. I always end up grabbing random staff because no one will help you if you don't force them to. There's a trippy little room next to it that's some kind of \"art gallery\" but it's very tiny and pretty much all glow in the dark/techno light ambiance.   Whole interior is super nice and new. They even have a random king sized bed you can lounge on in the living room area. Drink specials are not bad, not amazing. There's a restaurant in there too I've never been to. The bathrooms are hard to find, and nobody has a clear idea of how to guide you. I just use the unisex stall outside the elevators 'cause I don't need that kind of confusion.  Outside has all kinds of fun stuff! Live band on the weekends, giant Jenga, fire pits, more games, and it's all fenced off so it feels pretty private. Really awesome way to start the night! I've played Cards Against Humanity there for a couple hours and nobody bugs you...not even to offer you a drink. So if you want to be left alone, it's good."}
{"text":"I stopped by the other day to meet a friend and I have to say, it's looking pretty good! It was like stepping into a game room for adults without all the noise. I like the fact that I did not see any video poker machines anywhere in the hotel. There were awesome over-sized games everywhere, like a game of Connect Four on the wall. The decor is pretty fabulous, including a bed, to relax in the middle of the room. the outside is also fabulous, with a small grassy area and night time live music. This is not your typical Vegas hotel.   This is going to be a great place to meet up with friends and business associates."}
{"text":"Go here! and bring your friends! this place is amazingly fun. I've been to Vegas a few times, but I just recently discovered this place on my most recent visit.  When you walk in you are greeted with a much-appreciated whoosh of cold air and the smell of apples (strange, but true, everyone commented on the apple scent).  Inside there are random areas for seating, including a big bed and several huge lovesac bean bag chairs.  Outside there are more seating areas with comfy patio furniture to sit on and watch your friends play giant Jenga or giant beer pong or cornhole.  There is a counter where you can check out board games to play including Operation, Lasers, and Cards Against Humanity.  My only issue is that no one is stationed at the counter and you are supposed to ask your server to bring you a game, but we could never track down a server.... we just ordered drinks from the bar.  They had a live band there that started playing outside at 10 pm.  While I usually love live music, it was a little too loud to still comfortably talk to friends."}
{"text":"Dude this spot is the absolute shittttttt out with the old school crappy casino, in with the hip night club scene including An outdoor patio with all versions of games and patio furniture wrapped in AstroTurf. Trust me. If ur cool, u will fit in. Period. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fun place with lots of indoor and outdoor space!  Pros: tons of fun games (giant beer pong, cornhole, giant jenga, darts), indoor space is very open, heat lamps and fire pits all over outside so it stays pretty warm even when it's cool out, live band outside, indoor and outdoor bars  Cons: there were 2 dart boards inside but there was only 1 set of darts, outdoor area gets pretty crowded, this place is pretty large but there's only 4 girls bathrooms and the door was missing on one so the line gets loooong   If you're in the downtown area, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"There is security at the door, keeping an eye on things. Food is good, reasonably priced, & portions are huge, which is amazing considering it's downtown. Ambiance is nice. There's lots of comfy seating inside & huge games outside. Sport games play on the screens around the bar. They have a huge drop projection screen for Monday night football. People gather around the screen in beanbag chairs. Alcohol & giant beer pong, what's not to love. Opportunity for lots of fun & shenanigans. They have heatlamps & firepits surrounded by comfy seats. Staff is friendly & attentive. Dani is my fave & usual bartender. I always get greeted with a smile & she knows what my usual drink is."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fun things to do, good drinks but by FAR the best feature of this bar is the bartender, Beth. Beth had amazing service and kept us laughing the entire time. They need to keep her around at all costs lol... She turned a pretty fun place in to an awesome place for my party and I."}
{"text":"Whenever someone needs a suggestion in Downtown Las Vegas, the first spot that comes to mind is Gold Spike. This fusion of an adult playground, bar, lounge  and restaurant caters to all (21+) and has a little something for everyone. Love that this place doesn't have cover, has great craft beer selections, and always plays great music. The lounge part is super spacious and has tons of seating or dancing room depending on what you and the squad are feeling up to. On the inside there's pool tables, life size connect four, and a couple of other arcade games. However, the best part about this place is the outside. Out back, there's a massive backyard type of set-up with even more lounging, life size beer pong, corn hole, tether ball courts, life size Jenga, life size chess, and a stage for live music. When I recently went there they had also just added a late night food spot to satisfy your drunchies. Overall, if you are looking for a unique spot to grab a drink, dance, play games and eat then definitely go to Gold Spike."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and paid to take a photo in the photo booth and the camera was turned to the wall. I asked 4 different people to help us or at least give us a refund and every person told me to ask someone else for help. After waiting over 20 mins we gave up. Extremely upset with the horrible customer services."}
{"text":"Really delighted with the new Gold Spike! Great bar, fabulous lounge area, tasty food at the grill, and a nice garden out back! Oh, and it's open 24 hours and is also non-smoking. Fabulous.  Added bonus is that the staff are very friendly and I enjoyed a delicious prime rib dinner in the Grill. I need to eat gluten-free and our server was super helpful and careful to check with the kitchen. It was endearing and funny too, because our server didn't really know about gluten free requirements, and explained that as they've just reopened and their clientele has changed, they are now getting used to more demanding requests such as gluten free.  In the end all they had to do was remove the au-jus and give me regular, rather than seasoned fries. It still tasted great and at just $12 was a bargain!!  To top it off, as part of their wide selection of beers they even serve Estrella Damm Daura, which is a Spanish gluten-free beer made with barley but with the gluten removed during the process. My only gripe is the cost, which at $10 a bottle is a bit much. I'll be suggesting they stock an American g/f beer instead like Omission; I hope that would allow a cheaper price point!  I'll be back here... a lot!  More on gluten free in Las Vegas:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/gluten.free.las.vegas/"}
{"text":"Angie at The Grill would have me come back! Staying at the Oasis I don't want to have to go far for food and drinks! She was welcoming and personable! :D she made sure our food was everything we wanted and more! She even talked to us and made our experience an enjoyable one! I would definitely recommend this place but not just for the food! Angie works hard serving people and she told us on one of her two days off she spends doing chemo! I was so impressed to see someone so strong, with just a smile, bubbly personality...especially when she is going through what she is! I just want to thank her!!"}
{"text":"This place is so dope! If you aren't in the mood to get all dressed up and go clubbing on the strip, but still want to have a grand ole time, then come here. We came here twice, the most recent on a Saturday night. It was so live! Indoors they had a DJ on set while outdoors they had a local reggae band playing all night. Both the DJ and the band were seriously on point! Speaking of the outdoor area, it's an adult playground!! You got all sorts of games to play-- life size beer pong, Jenga and chess to name a few. If you're lucky enough you'll get to play a game or two. It can get pretty busy and games get occupied rather quickly."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what I was walking into here because It comes across as a typical nightclub from outside. They even scan your face when they look at your ID. Whoa. The future!!!   It was super mellow when we walked in after dinner but the bartender was friendly and poured a stiff vodka soda. The venue inside is huge and has a little food counter service set up in the back. No clue what was being served because, vodka.   My group went straight to the outdoor area in the back. Tether ball, giant beer pong, four square. It's an adult playground!!! I could and will spend many many hours back here.   I didn't realize until on the way out that inside has games too. I'm curious what this place is like when it's poppin' because I'm already a fan.   I'm sure that I'll end up checking the indoor food scene out the next time I'm in. Why? Because, vodka."}
{"text":"I love the games and entertainment!  Nothing like enjoying some drinks and playing giant Jenga or corn hole. Super fun, I recommend this place to anyone like me who likes to drink and do stuff!  Bartenders are friendly, cool atmosphere. Bathrooms always seem to have issues though."}
{"text":"Horrible security! They are Very rude! He refused to let me know his name. Management where are you at?"}
{"text":"I'm a fan because of Klinq, and I love the 99 cent beer!  The remodel is OK, but skews way too youthful for my taste. I had a Chicago dog on a tortilla, which was pretty good. Had to try it with their hot sauce assortment, but didn't check the numbers on the bottles first. So a 9 is very hot! But the hot dog was good, it had lots of peppers & onions. Love the Airstream in the back."}
{"text":"This was such a fun place.  I had friends in town from LA and they loved this spot too!  The outside area features a great lounge spot with live music all night.  There are overgrown games to play out there as well: barrels and a small b-ball for beer pong, large sandbags for giant corn-hole (yeah i said it), even plastic ice-skating for $5!    The interior of the place was pretty chill, low couches/lounge areas, good music and fun people watching.  Drinks were reasonably priced and the vibe was really casual.  Get there early b/c the line gets long quickly. This place is perfect for large groups of friends looking for soemthing entertaining to do on a budged.  Great spot that will definitely become a new hangout!"}
{"text":"I come here ALL the time and spend a decent amount of money each time...the more i drink the more money I'm likely to spend (I'm a shots for everyone type of drunk). It's usually fun, and drinks are reasonably price. Bartenders in the back are pretty awesome. It's the front bar that's the problem, and security. I don't know if their head is inflated because of their Real World season, but the staff looks like they hate their jobs. I'm not sure they train staff on \"customer service.\" I've worked in retail, so I don't necessarily believe that the customer is always right, but common courtesy every customer deserves at least. I'm literally talking at the very LEAST a smile from the bartenders and a \"what can I get for you?\" Everyone looks miserable as hell unless they are talking to each other or someone they know."}
{"text":"One of my absolute place to hang out in Down Town.   Gold Spike always comes up with fun events and ideas for people to attend.  Good music, fun crowd, plenty of fun."}
{"text":"As an old time Vegas resident, I've had a very good view of downtowns transformation and Gold Spike is quite possibly one of the most visual representations of that.  I never knew how to describe Gold Spike until one of my friends called it \"an adult clubhouse\" which is perfect. When you come to gold spike there's everything to play. Inside there's a DJ booth, dance floor, bean bags,giant connect four, a pool table, and giant shuffle board. If that's not enough there's a whole area outside. While the inside has it's DJ booth, the outside has its stage area where bands play, there's seats for groups, an ice rink(which may or may not be temporary) and GIANT BEER PONG!!!!! Gold spike is really one of those places that you have to come to and has become sort a meeting grounds for all of downtown. You never have a bad time and if you are, you go to a different part of the bar and it's a whole new vibe PS: if you ever need a quiet place to hang out during the day, gold spike is very good for that. I've ridden my bike here before midday and just grabbed a few drinks and just relaxed"}
{"text":"There really do need to be two listings for this place: one for service/pricing/food & drink quality, and one for the venue & ambiance. Since there aren't, though, those first few things drag down the venue/ambiance score to a solid 2. I would go with 3, but according to Yelp, that means \"A-OK,\" and a \"Meh, I've experienced better\" really seems to fit the best here. If service were consistently good here and the drinks were priced more reasonably for a downtown spot, at least a 3 would be warranted.  I never expect a stellar experience here, especially early afternoon when almost no one is there, but it's clear who should be in a customer-facing job and who shouldn't.  Our group of 5 walked in and ordered a few drinks from the bartender, Oscar. My friend asked him if we could also order food with him. He said yes, so she asked for garlic fries, and all five of us heard him repeat it in confirmation. We brought our drinks to a nearby table to wait. Meanwhile, a server came by to give us some menus and see if we wanted to order anything else to eat. A few people did put in orders. A handful of minutes later, the first of their orders (fried mozz & zucchini) started coming out. A couple minutes after that, our friend's sandwich came out, but still no garlic fries. We asked the bartender if he'd heard back about our garlic fries. His answer: \"You didn't order any food with me.\" Really? We would have understood if he had just said, \"Oh, did you ask for garlic fries? I'm so sorry, I must have spaced that order, I'll put it in right away.\" But as it was, he just flat out told us we didn't order food with him, even though all of us heard her order and him give verbal acceptance. Meanwhile, our server, Angelina, was very nice, personable, and accommodating, and apologized on his behalf.  There were was also questionable handling of our drink tab by Oscar and by another female employee who appeared to be at least a shift manager. Our guy friend went to the bar to settle the separate tab we had there and asked Oscar if he could put it on a different card than the one we handed him at the beginning. He didn't know, and the other woman just said \"No.\" We asked again because we'd never been to a bar where you can't transfer your tab to another card when cashing out. After going around in a few verbal circles, the woman explained there would still be a pending charge on the first card that would be there a couple days before disappearing. Great, yes, we know -- we understand how authorizations work. Assuming we didn't, though, why wouldn't you just offer us that caveat to begin with instead of just flat-out saying \"No?\"  Anyway, this experience isn't necessarily indicative of every one I've had at Gold Spike, but most have been mediocre. Coupled with the over-priced drinks (even during happy hour, which only applies to a few things anyway), even the giant games can't outweigh the \"meh\"-ness of this place. It's just so damn conveniently located for us, though, that we'll still end up there for random mediocre lunches in the future (the garlic & herb fries still call to us, after all). Hopefully, Angelina will be there to make it that much more bearable."}
{"text":"Cool spot younger crowd no gambling just a bunch of oversized old skool games we went for super bowl it was 90.00 for all you can drink n eat 1-5pm I'm talking top shelf liquor too not house booze and a pretty good spread of food as well"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was actually rad...now it's turned into a YMCA for the tools of Vegas. What happened to this gem?"}
{"text":"This has become a regular haunt for myself and my friends. We normally go hang out while the bartender Joe is working. He makes the best bloody mary/maria mix you'll find for miles. The staff is friendly, the venue is cool, and drinks and food are great and reasonably priced. My friend and I sat at the bar for hours and didn't even realize. We asked if they had any unique hot sauce for our chicken wings, and they proceeded to bring us over 20 unique bottles from all over the place. I will be a regular for as long as I'm here!"}
{"text":"Gold Spike is a great place to go with a group of friends looking for a fun time. Seems like a bar that would fit right in the San Francisco Bay Area, geared towards a younger 20-something year old crowd.  Drinks are fairly priced, around $10 give or take. Some nights there are cheaper drink specials. Food's tasty, nothing special for a bar though.  The main draw though are all the things and activities to do. Inside there's usually a DJ at night, and always cornhole, in addition to the arcade and carnival games. Outside is where the action's at: oversized beer pong, jenga, and four square, plus the live band some nights.  Gold Spike can get pretty hectic  at night, but it is a good time. I'd recommend rolling through with a big group."}
{"text":"I patronized Gold Spike twice in the space of about twelve hours.  The first time was in the evening when the vibe was loungey. There was a DJ playing in the \"Living Room\" where people were reliving their childhoods playing Jenga and Bean Bag Toss. I stepped out into the backyard for a bit where a band was playing while more guests were playing some schoolyard-type game I couldn't quite figure out.  I returned the next morning to the Grill in order to redeem an underwhelming breakfast at the Garden Court Buffet (see review) as well as benefit from the free wi-fi. I had a very tasty order of Cinnamon French Toast. The two servers and even the chef were very pleasant and chatty with me. The morning was slow so they didn't mind me catching up with some business on my laptop.   I would definitely return at night with some friends to enjoy the music and the \"recess\" games. I'd also come back for breakfast. Whatever mixed reviews have been posted here about the staff couldn't have been about the two mature lady servers and the African-American chef I met."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of DTLV and I wasn't super motivated to check out Gold Spike after hearing the comparisons of it to dorm social rooms, but I ended up here with friends are big fans, so I played nice.   The ambiance is odd. Kind of reminds me of a dated living room, but we had a nice time playing board games and having a few drinks. I think this was due to the company more than anything else. Once it started getting crowded, louder and a band started up, I had my fill and decided to head out.   I see who this place would appeal to, but it's just not for me."}
{"text":"We went on a monday to avoid the crowds. The playground was awesome! The service was slow for over priced drinks. The security and cleaning staff walked around with an attitude and looked pissed off, and there were empty glasses and bottles everywhere. The ping pong tables were pretty raggety, but life size beer pong will change your life! Also 4 square is a great game. Very fun place."}
{"text":"So the other day I put a review on how I had a horrible experience with the security . The manager Adam contacts me directly and tells me to call him and explain the situation a little bit more to him . I then call him and he is super apologetic and very professional and gave me explanations . He then told me I can get back into goldspike and if I have any issues with security to call him directly !   Adam thank you for following up and being professional and understanding my side of the story . I will make sure that me and my friends will keep going over there and I will refer all friends to go over there to have a good time !"}
{"text":"On Saturday, 9 July 2016 at approximately 11:40pm, I, Nate walked up to the front door where the first Polynesian Male Security at Re-Entry was very kind and informed which line I needed to be in for Male General Admission. From that moment I greeted all security personnel and complied to all uniform security checks as I, myself, am a Security Manager for a Beach Club and Nightclub on the strip but was in return greeted with rude forceful directions followed by a forceful slamming of the stamp on the bottom of my right wrist. Upon looking up at her as to why she was so rude she returned a reaction to belittle and make me feel like I should not come in. Moving into the next phase of security procedure the person checking for contraband and/or weapons didn't even attempt to give me directions as he just forced me around. Moments later I found my group of friends a table near the bar with no further incident.  Note: Sad enough to say this place used to be my favorite place downtown during weekdays since I could never make it out because I manage the nightclub but without a doubt if I could give this place negative stars it would be a 5 star rating for the door. Bartenders on the other hand were very nice in all aspects granted I only bought and drank two alcoholic beverages.  End"}
{"text":"I get what they're trying to do here which is like a hip and cool hang out joint for adults. There's a lot of places to chill and if you're \"lucky\" you might even get the bed to relax on. As for me, my germaphobia begins to kick in so I avoid that attraction.   I feel like there's a lot of potential for this place. Maybe I need to go during night time to fully experience this joint because every time I go, there's hardly anyone there. As mentioned, there's a lot of space to sit at but then there's also a lot of empty spaces. Maybe it's some sort of a dance floor?   I think they could add some more games too. There's a connect four and darts inside. Outside there's plenty of things to do like Twister, life size beer pong, tetherball, life size chess, and more. I can see why this place would be fun but I think it needs a lot of maintenance. Many of their chairs and games looks worn out and it makes me wonder when was the last time they bothered deep cleaning any of their materials?   The drinks are okay. I'm not much of a drinker so I don't think I'm the best candidate to judge alcohol, but the price is a bit on the high side. Last time, I got a watered down alcohol and was charged $15 for it. Talk about buyers remorse. I wish they had drink discounts, but if they do, there was no sign of it anywhere.   I'm always a bit hesitant to go here but it is pretty fun if you don't know what else to do around downtown. So if you want to have a good time, enjoy the free games and sip on some drinks. But again, I just wish they cleaned their stuff once in a while. Or maybe replace them overall!"}
