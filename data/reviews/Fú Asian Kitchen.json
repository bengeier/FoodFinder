{"text":"The food is nice, original Chinese, the whole family enjoyed a lot after a long drive. We arrived quite late, only 40 minutes before its close, but the staff were very nice and took good care of us."}
{"text":"So good! We found this place on a lark, middle line between overly priced places and Panda Express. We were so happy we chose this place - the food was fresh and tasted great, used more spices and oils to flavor than just slathering it with sauce. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Have been there twice so far and will go again. . .I hope it makes it because both times the place was empty.  It is my new favorite Chinese dining place. . .My husband loved it also and he is not a huge fan of Chinese food. . Service is good and so is atmosphere. . .We had the garlic noodles both times..I had Mongolian Beef and loved it.  It was mildly seasoned which I found appealing and the beef was as tender as I have ever had. . . Had that the second time as well!.  My husband had the Honey Walnut Shrimp and he was pleased.  We tried the General's chicken, it was good but not as good as the other dishes that we tried.  We also enjoyed vegetable egg rolls!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was awesome.   Honey walnut shrimp, pad thai, and peppersteak were delicious.  Steak was tender.  Everything was very flavorful.  A little pricy but the quality was worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I frequent the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas often, but never made it to this restaurant until last weekend. On Sunday 5/17 around 530pm, we decided to try it out. It wasn't busy at all. Service was great, and the ambiance was nice, but unfortunately  the two dishes we shared just weren't up to par. I wouldn't advise getting the Hong Kong seafood noodle dish. Sauce was weird tasting, hardly any shrimp or scallops or even vegetables for that matter. I mean baby scallops? For an Asian cuisine in Vegas, especially at the hard rock hotel, it was disappointing. I have had better food in LA at Chin Chin Grill!! There is actually one in Vegas too!  Check out the Chinese Chicken Salad, General Tsao's Chicken, and much more! Sorry FU , don't think we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great staff , good food, very accommodating staff quick service.recommend when with a large Group ask just for a bunch of different dishes and wait to see what the restaurant brings you , we did and it was fun  The hot and sour soap is very good."}
{"text":"Was very shocked that this place was not full, especially during Restaurant Week. Normally this is a big Red Flag for me, as I am concerned when a restaurant is not busy during peak dinner hours. But what a pleasant surprise for us. This place is like a hidden gem. Great food and service, with a trendy/hip decor.   We stayed mostly on the Restaurant Week menu, and it was worth the price. We did have one appetizer that was not on our prefixed menu, this was the chilled shrimp with the spicy jellyfish. This was really good and had a nice kick to it. It might have needed just a degree or two more spice, but it was great for me! The texture of the jellyfish might not please everyone, as it had a slight crunch with a texture of Udon noodles. Our first course was a Asian Tapas sampler: Pan Fried Shrimp Dumplings with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potstickers, and Spicy Wontons. All three were really good, with our unanimous winner being the fried shrimp dumpling. Second course was a choice of: Wok seared Salmon with Ginger Basil sauce, or Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli. Since there was four in our group, we easily all shared. The ribs were amazing. Perfectly prepared with a side of kimchee. The shrimp was really good and they were of great size too. The salmon was delicious as well. The ginger basil added just the right amount of zest to the perfectly cooked piece of fish. Nice size portions on all the entrees. Our final course was the dessert trio of: Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and finally Lychee Mochi Ice Cream. Each one of us liked different ones for different reasons, so be sure to ask the staff questions based on your personal tastes or desires. I will add that the wine prices were right on line with other restaurants of this price range. Average amount of selections of wines and beers.  This leads me into the staff, OUTSTANDING service! They were on top of everything! We had several questions through out the meal and they directed us in good directions based on our specific tastes. All in all, this was a great meal for the price. The only possible draw back might be the location in the Hard Rock, as it should have been very busy the whole evening. We all said we would go back there again."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch special to go. Side note, if you order it to go, you do not get the free soup that is suppose to come with it. Supposedly, it's because they don't have a container for it..... I guess it's too hard for them to place that order....  I ordered the chicken and veggies with rice. They give you a decent amount of chicken. It comes with mixed veggies of broccoli, bok choy, carrots and cabbage. I also asked for hot chili oil and sriracha on the side. Overall customer service was good. I was able to call down and then pick it up after it was made. However, it tastes more american than asian."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as I had hoped for. Service was great but only 3 other tables when we arrived at 7:00 on a Wednesday and we were the last ones there at 8:00. Ordered potstickers which were bland, Sea bass was good but boring, and the vegetarian dish was also bland. In this town I'm not sure this place will survive. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had! Honey walnut shrimp, Garlic green beans, shrimp fried rice. Wow. Amazing."}
{"text":"Ask for the vegetarian menu. Yummiest crispy tofu on the curry and veggies dish. Kung Pao vegan chicken too! Yummy cocktails. Hardly any smoke at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Originally came here in August 2013 and it was delicious gourmet Chinese food that tasted unique and chef-prepared.  Now, in 2018 - the once delicious Kung Pao is now standard takeout fare - they bring it to you with pretty much a full bell pepper chopped up in massive chunks, and it tastes like bland boring crap.  Not the kind of food you expect for these prices or for this location. You pay $18 for what you could get at a strip mall spot for $8.  It's 2, 3 Star food and the service and all that is great but the 4-5 star prices make it a complete rip off."}
{"text":"Omg food is bomb! Great service, that sea bass though ugh amazing! Oh and those green beans like what?! This place needs to be packed with people come on!! Loved it."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to it since me and my husband had it last time but it was extremely disappointing!   We were not greeted by our server after 15 minutes later, the online menu said they had porridge but they canceled it and don't have it anymore. I ordered a lunch menu while my husband ordered two appetizers and waited 30 minutes before the server stopped by and told us that they didn't have one of the appetizers ( lobster puff ) . Finally when the food came, they totally forgot I had a soup that came with my order and didn't bother serving me until 20 minutes later. They strongly need more training with their servers and faster speed with the food since it's not even filled up with customers."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. The bellman recommend this restaurant and it did not disappoint. We were seated right away, it was not full at the time. We order several dishes. The plates are served family style, perfect for sharing. We ordered teriyaki chicken skewers to start they were ok. For main course we had cashew chicken which was good but they forgot to add the cashews. We pointed it out to the server and he brought some out. The shrimp with mixed veggies, pork fried rice and garlic green beans and beef with mushrooms dish which were all great! I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is in the Hard Rock Casino. If you like Chinese food, you can go to this place. The food is okay, but like the other restaurants in Vegas, the price is not cheap. There is not a lot of people eating there, so you don't need to wait for a long time. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Good, solid Asian fare.   We were there at the tail end of lunch time on a Sunday so while our service was excellent we may not be the best data point since the place was almost empty.   Food was delicious though and the lunch specials (~$9 for soup, egg roll and the entrée with rice) might have been the best deal of our entire stay.    I noticed they were doing a ton of takeout orders - this struck me as odd.  Where do you take your takeout food to when you're in a Vegas resort?  You're not allowed to bring food in the pool so where else?  Your room?  Weird..."}
{"text":"Good and service was really good.  I was surprised restaurant wasn't more busy.  Great Chinese food!  Our server did a great job recommending what to order."}
{"text":"This place is nothing more than really Americanized and not so good Asian food.  Fusion--ha!  If you mix crap with crap you still have crap.  I had the duck with plum sauce--greasy with mushy skin (should be crispy).  Plum sauce was essentially flavorless duck sauce (not sauce for duck, but that sweet apricot sauce that comes in those little packets).  Served with stale rice without any aromatics.  Heck, minute rice has more flavor.    If the food was even 1/2 as good as frozen Chinese food from my grocery store, then the price would still be too high.    Only plus was that our server was friendly.    Hard Rock--give this place a hard kick out of your casino!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing vegan options! The vegetables are perfectly cooked and awesome flavors and spices!!! Give it a try, hidden gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very reasonably priced.. And the service very attentive. Not sure you can do much better than this place for Chinese food on the strip and the cost is half what some of the other hotel Asian restaurants charge."}
{"text":"This dinner was disappointing. I was excited to eat here based on the reviews, not what I expected. Three items I would not recommend.. Garlic noodles, crab Rangoon and chicken wraps. The wraps were watery and plain. Literally, there was a pool of water on the plate. Thanks for drying off the lettuce. Garlic noodles were nothing to write home about... Raw garlic and noodles with some free onion for color. The crab rangoons were fried cream cheese wontons with no crab not worth the $10 price tag. Friendly staff..but food quality, will not return. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my hubby here in a very busy weekend. Service was quick and servers very observant of customers needs. Love the ribs with honey glaze. We had to have seconds on that. The fish for main dish was cooked just right to perfection and presentation was good. If you want to eat in a nice seated dinning, with fresh, quality asian food, this is the place to go. The cocktails in the menu was also good. :)"}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell Yelp how disappointed I am in Fu.  I am staying at the Hard Rock Hotel on business.  My colleague and myself are sitting in our room watching the BCS National Championship game.  We decided we did not want to go far for dinner, so we chose the closest restaurant to our elevator.  We placed our order at the hostess counter, so far so good.  When it is time to pick up our food, I ask the hostess for a couple of plates so that we may enjoy our dinner in the room.  SHE REFUSED TO GIVE US PLATES.  Are you kidding me???  I explained that we are staying at the hotel (we charged dinner to our room).  I even told her that I would bring the plates back when we finished.  She was not having any of it.  I had to call room service to bring me plates.  RIDICULOUS.  We finally got the plates.  I wish they had never come.  The food was bland.  The rice was under cooked.  The Pad Thai had no flavor whatsoever.  It tasted like Panda Express on a BAD Night.  FAIIL."}
{"text":"It should be noted that Vegas has the reputation for not having exactly the best cultural foods. If you're from Asia and want an authentic experience, you'll have a hard time. The restaurant doesn't try to specialize in one specific cuisine but has dishes from many different cultures. You're not gonna get the authentic Asian experience in this city, but if you're Chinese or Viet you'll get a nice taste of home.   Also, special shoutout to service which bumped up this 3-star restaurant to a four."}
{"text":"What i love about this place are the employees working especially the ladies.. Lol the food were okay."}
{"text":"Not good food.   The starters seemed reheated and not at all fresh.  The main didn't excite at all in fact pretty flavourless.   Had high hopes of a nice meal but was left disappointed.   The restaurant definitely needs a makeover- looks tired."}
{"text":"I am sooooo happy we made a point of dining at Fu. This is some of the BEST Chinese food I've eaten in years. Literally. I came for lunch and had the dim sum sampler - and made the decision at that point to return for dinner with my hubby.   We ordered the Kim chee beef fried rice, fried five spice pork chops with jalapeños and kung pao shrimp. YUM!!! The fried rice was amazing, wonderfully flavored by the Kim chee with the most melt-in-your-mouth beef I've ever tasted!! The pork chops were also beyond delicious - crispy and tender and flavorful. My mouth was very happy! The kung pao shrimp was a home run, the shrimp was cooked perfectly - not overdone as is often the case - while the green peppers were nice and crisp, and it wasn't overly sauced nor too spicy. The servings were very generous and we definitely over-ordered. I was so bummed that we couldn't take the leftovers with us!  If you're in Vegas, and have a hankering for some Chinese food, definitely make the trek over to Fu! You will not be disappointed. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good, clean, and fresh food. I have eaten here a few times and I am always pleased. Service is great and the soups are delicious. Prices are slightly higher than a place outside of a casino but that is expected."}
{"text":"Glad to see the Woo family is cooking again in Las Vegas,  Started with famous garlic noodles and shrimp dumplings.  Then had scallops with black bean sauce and shrimp in tomato sauce with broccoli (on New Years menu).   Seafood was very fresh.  Also had chicken with eggplant and peking duck.  Had choice of teas and got a great one.  Little pricy, but that is to be expected for hotel restaurants.  Waiters were very friendly and helpful.  Very enjoyable, relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how this restaurant is so highly rated.  I searched for restaurants to eat at for dinner during our vacation to Las Vegas, and we were pretty excited to eat here once we saw the large selection on the menu and the photos online.  We were sadly disappointed with the food; and maybe it is because we have had such good Asian food in the past at other restaurants, that Fu did not meet our expectations.  Even coming in the middle of dinner time on a weekend, the restaurant was very empty and quiet.  The waitress was nice, and it was not her fault that we did not enjoy our food.  I would say the food is very average at best.  We ordered the Peking duck, which actually came out from the kitchen cold.  Not warm or room temperature, but actually cold.  We asked the waitress to take it back, and it seems that they just barely heated it and brought it back out for us, but we tried to eat it anyway.  The udon noodles with stir fry that we ordered looked tasty, but when we actually ate it, it was very bland, and the only flavor seemed to come mostly from the oil that they loaded in the food, rather than from natural flavors brought out from the ingredients.  This made the dish very heavy on the stomach.  The tofu kung pao was inundated with many large pieces of vegetables and barely had any actual tofu, even though the serving was very big.  Each dish was very expensive for the quality of the food... We would have been happy to spend the money if the food was worth it, although the bill was too much in this case on an unenjoyable and forgettable meal.  Overall, we felt as if we wasted a night of our vacation here.  On the bright side, free parking at the Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"Great food!  We were weary about going in because we could clearly see that the place was near empty. Every other restaurant we had passed by at the Hard Rock was much more full than this place and I'm generally concerned about the quality of the food when no one is eating there.  We took the chance anyway. I'm glad we did!  We ordered lots of food and the only slight bummer was the duck was a little bit dry. Other than that everything was so tasty.   The specialty drinks and shots are great too! After dinner we ordered the Rabbit shot. Then we ordered it again. Our server was super friendly too."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service last night party of 4 and we LOVED everything we ordered. Our 2 male servers were great, super friendly ,attentive and knowledgeable about the menu .. service was spot on ..thank you wish I got both of your names .. we started with Calamari app it was amazing ..omg good. We ordered honey walnut shrimp w lemon aioli  soo good ! Also the shrimp scallop sizzle plater ....yummmm and spiced fried salmon good but least favorite of the night and potstickers.   For sure would highly recommend this place ... Yummy"}
{"text":"We were greeted right when we walked up an promptly seated. The waiter was patient with us as we asked a million questions about the menu items due to food allergies. The food was delicious. I will be eating here again if we come back to town."}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was good but this is fast food quality Chinese with restaurant prices. I had the General's Chicken and tried the Mongolian Beef...both lacked flavor. There are actually fast food places that have more flavor in these dishes than Fu. I wouldn't go here until you're just dying for chinese and you're stuck at the Hard Rock.   I tried this place because of the appearance of the restaurant and the name seemed fun. However, I think this place need to either improve the taste of their food or cut the prices in half."}
{"text":"if you are in hard rock hotel and carving for Chinese food, it is not bad at all for Chinese food. comparing to the Chinese restaurant on the strip, Fu is close to traditional Chinese food. However, it doesn't have a variety of entrée."}
{"text":"Monday Night dinner! If your Hard Rocking in Las Vegas you have to try FU! Great Food great Service!  I went with the XO Udon Noodles with Stir Fried Shrimp and Scallops. This was a great treat never had I had a wheat noodle so light and delicate the shrimp and scallops were cooked tender and the vegetables were perfect with a mild crunch! My wife enjoyed her Sweet & Sour Chicken it wasn't that prefab stuff you get at normal Chinese restaurants! The Chicken was real pieces of white meat lightly breaded and fried and of course it had a Sweet & Sour sauce that alone would make you want more bits of pineapple and cherries and plenty of vegetables!  FU serves homestyle so there is plenty to share and entrees go a long way so bring an appetite. They also make some good mixed Drinks! I had an Lychee Acri Blueberry Martini normally I like my straight up Martini but this was a great accompaniment to my dinner. Special Bravo to Hannah our server for making our evening wonderful! If you like Asian fare with a little twist visit FU in the Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great asian fusion food. If you like asian food tho sis the real deal! hosting my party there, they can do set menus family styles for parties. very excited!"}
{"text":"Always quality food when you come here. The honey walnut prawns are huge and perfectly battered. The general's chicken was very popular at our table. The HK chow mein is delicious. Five spice calamari to die for. Everything on the menu is great. The service is wonderful and friendly. The food is always cooked perfectly. This is a great place for high quality authentic Chinese food and it has a great ambiance. Wonderful for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! We always make a special trip here when in vegas and it's pretty reasonable for vegas!  The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"After hours of walking the convention center and overhearing people talking about Chinese food, I was starving and started thinking about lunch. I walked by Fu several times on my way to my room at the HRH Towers and it was empty each time. I had to pack up and leave so I decided to stop in and give a try before I left for the airport.  Waiters were on their game - very attentive. My order is about as white as it gets - but for the record, I have been to China and I know how to use chopsticks. I started off with egg roll appetizers. Loved the presentation, and great flavor. The sweet and sour just perfect and super spicy hot mustard. YES...you can screw up eggrolls. They did not.  Wanted to order off the main menu but realized I should probably keep it simple and stick to lunch portions. So I ordered the General's Chicken off the lunch menu which came in a rice bowl and came with Eggflower soup. $11? Wait, I am in Vegas, right? Of course, you'll get nailed for a soda at $4 but who cares. This was the BEST chicken I've had in a really long time! Perfectly spicy, tangy, sweet - YUM! All white meat chicken, cooked perfectly with no weird gooey parts. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The Eggflower soup had plenty of mushrooms and veggies in it also - made for a delicious.  I definitely got my Chinese fix for the year! Lots of food, great atmosphere, friendly service and high quality food at a decent price. I would definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good, stay away. I was very close to dishing out a 1 Star rating but I decided it was worthy of two, I am careful how I dish out the 1 star rating. Food was bland, not much flavor in anything. They claimed chicken was all white breast meat but it was more like mystery meat to me. Place was near empty, not busy at all yet we still waited forever for our food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it was just okay - but when I returned this week with friends, I was really impressed.  The Crab Rangoons, Stirred Tenderloin of Beef w/ Mushrooms, Shrimp & Scallops w/ Lemon Butter and Seafood Fried Rice were all outstanding!  The BIG disappointment was the absolutely ridiculous prices on the wine list (extremely limited choices - which is fine).  They wanted $54 for a bottle of wine that tastes lousy and can be purchased at Wal-Mart for $13!   Heck, even on the strip, the standard markup is 100% on bottled wine - but the markup at FU is 400%.  A bottle of Veuve (champagne) that sells for $43 was listed for $150.  Again, ridiculous!  I settled for a mixed  drink that costed $13; it was served in a glass that was so tall and narrow, that after they filled it with ice, I'm guessing I actually got about 3oz of liquid.  Eat here, but just drink water - save your imbibing for the casino (Hard Rock)."}
{"text":"Not Ordinary Asian!   This was among the BEST Asian food I have ever had in the Las Vegas area. Delicious from the Hot and Sour Soup to the Walnut Shrimp and Crab cakes in between. The food presentation was clean neat and crisp. Service was near the top but not many people there. I had an early dinner. Even the cheap desert was Mangolicious. My bill was $50 for one and while dining alone is not much fun I would do it again. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I ordered the walnut shrimp and fried rice. It was delicious! The portion sizes are huge and I couldn't finish the meal. Great Asian dishes here!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice. The staff was very friendly. We ordered just a few sides. Crab cakes, rice, wontons and egg rolls. All very good! Prices are not bad for being in Vegas. Located in the hard rock hotel in the casino area. You can share this items with at least 2 people. The egg rolls and crab cakes come in 2. Food tasted fresh."}
{"text":"It was delightful. I ate the potstickers and they were delicious. I was sad to see I had ate them all because they were so good. The presentation and staff were excellent. I was treated kindly as a solo tourist diner. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are my favorite here and very reasonable. Dinner has more options and more flavors. Service is prompt and consistent. Inside the Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"I'm. Native San Franciscan, this is an authentic Hong Kong Chinese restaurant! I was pleasantly surprised when our early dinner turned into a feast! Try Peking Duck, honey cashew prawns, General Zhou chicken. I was in ecstasy!"}
{"text":"After spending a decent amount here in happy to say I'm glad I dropped in. Their food was great and service was impeccable! My wife who is usually hard to please was full and said she had enjoyed her meal- especially the dessert! She's happy, I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Stellar Asian food! I've eaten Asian at the Bellagio, Caesar's and Venetian and this place in the Hard Rock is by far the best. Unpretentious prices, attentive and friendly staff, a great menu selection and tasty food bursting with savory umami. They had a cute dim sum platter that had one piece of every type of dim sum you could want. How easy is that?"}
{"text":"I am Chinese and I have been to almost every Chinese restaurant off the strip in Vegas and I had been to some high-end strip Chinese restaurant such as Jasmin. I have to say Fu is an unique Chinese American fusion culinary experience and it was worth every penny I paid. Like many Chinese, I was initially skeptical about over priced Chinese food. But boy was I glad I made the choice to come here.  For a party of four, we ordered the miso sea bass wrap and the baby back pork rib. Both were outstanding. For main entrees, we had grilled beef tenderloin with Fu sauce, wok fried salmon with creamy Thai basil sauce, eggplant with pork, and garlic noodle. I was so impressed with the uniqueness of the sauce, and the perfect balance of tastes in each dish. For dessert, we ordered the mango pudding and the banana spring rolls with ice cream. That topped off an outstanding meal with great company.  You cannot view Fu in the same category as your traditional Chinese restaurants. Fu epitomizes what a good Chinese fusion restaurant should be. It introduces new senses to the palate, and it boldly adds new flavors to some otherwise very simple dishes. It truly is worth the money"}
{"text":"I hate to speak poorly of this spot because I've been coming here for years. I used to play a lot in the casino so I would get a nice food comp of either 15 or 20 bucks. I think that made it easier to like because, without the food comp, spending 20-30 bucks on a meal that I can get faster and possibly even better tasting only 10 minutes up the road seems ridiculous to spend here when it's less then 10 bucks there. But, I've been coming here so much that the hostess immediately remembers me every time I arrive even if it's been a very long time. She's very sweet and I hate to give the place a poor review for the value if she works there. But, honestly, it's just average for extremely high pricing. I usually get the Mongolian beef, which is decent but it's hard to stomach paying 20 bucks when, like I mentioned, I can go to a local place and get the exact same meal for 6.99. Sorry nice host girl but I gotta be honest"}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to come to Sin City for Labor Day weekend. My friends and I ended up booking a room at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel as we drove to LVNV. It was my first time staying at this location and I was amazed at how stunning the casino and hotel was. On our second night as we were getting dressed and ready to go to the strip I started getting hungry and knew I should probably eat before we headed out. Looking at the list of dining options located inside the casino I opted to eat at Fu Restaurant because we ate at Mr. Lucky's the night before and I was not impressed with their food or service and because this was one of the few options that was open late.  This Asian fusion restaurant was located right by the entrance to our hotel room's tower. The place was hip and beautifully decorated with lanterns and Chinese symbols. I ordered the Ahi Poke with Avocado and Won Ton Chips and the Hong Kong Chow Mein with Chicken, Scallops, BBQ Pork and Shrimp. To be honest, I did not expect the food to be good because it was Asian cuisine made in an Americanize setting. So when I tasted the dishes that came out I was very surprised and pleased at how flavorful and delicious all the food came out to be. The ahi was fresh, the noodles were crispy, the pork was tender, and the sauces were so tasty. The service was also outstanding. Our server was great at helping to clarify and suggest items on the menu. He was also very tentative. I had a great dining experience and would recommend Fu Restaurant to anyone who stays at this hotel or ends up at the Hard Rock Casino."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because we were starving but I highly doubt it. This place is quite empty but the food was really good! It is served family style. I HIGHLY recommend the garlic noodles and the Stir Fry Chicken with Eggplant and Basil. I am dreaming of that plate currently. Best I've had hands down! Chicken Fried Rice was good -- not too greasy and flavorful."}
{"text":"For a hangover, I love Asian food, some noodles or fried rice, mmmm. This served well but not the best. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and my friend had the chicken rice. The rice was not really fried (personal preference) as I would like have liked it.   The service was good, kitchen was kind of slow given the restaurant was not busy at all. There were a few lunch specials even on Saturday!   We also had an Irish coffee which was really good. The decor and ambiance is really neat."}
{"text":"Service was very good. We were a group of 6 that were seated immediately. Very expensive for the portion but you know casino pricing. The food was ok. The 2 that had Pho were very excited. The rest of us said the food was ok."}
{"text":"FU is a good restaurant in the same vein as Chin Chin's, P.F. Chang's and other mainstream Chinese restaurants that's not the hole in the wall down and dirty Chinatown styled nor the cheap steamtray  mall fare like Panda Express or even Pick Up Stix (which does cook to order).  The service is good here.  The food, and I'm Cantonese, is good.  The prices and portions of course are high and low... smaller portions for higher rates compared to Chinatown area restaurants.  But keep in mind, this is in the Hard Rock.  This has a different ambient vibe.   The food is authentic in that it's good food.    If you're craving Chinese food, this is a good place.  If you're taking a date to Chinese food, this is a good place that's not ghetto or down and dirty dining (the type of place you'd take your girlfriend of 10+ years you're now taking for granted or your wife and kids for eats).  This is a good \"white folk friendly\" Chinese restaurant, meaning some of the waitstaff are non-Asian and speak perfect English, any Asian women working here are not old  Mama-San's nor the FOB or China Doll types, but are mainstream young Asian Americans that non-Asians can relate to, and the place is very very very clean.  So, it's a really nice place to visit and has a positive and clean vibe to it."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant as we were attending an event later in the evening at the Joint, so this was convenient.  My wife and I love Asian cuisine, so we thought we would give it a try.  First, the ambiance is nice and the service was excellent - no issues there.  We ordered the dim sum plate, egg rolls and Singapore noodles.  The dim sum plate contained a fluffy pork bun (cha sui pao), har gao sui mai (shimp dumpling, pork dumpling) and a pot sticker.  All items were very dry and bland.  The egg rolls were fine, although a bit greasy while the noodles were good, but nothing to write home about.    Overall, I was disappointed in the quality of the food, certainly given the price we paid.  I can't say that we will return to this restaurant the next time we are at Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Some of the best Dim Sum I have ever had.  That includes Soul, Hong Kong, and an amazing place in Kyoto called Tiger Dumplings.  I just had two sets of their samplers and they were f'ng PERFECT, and I mean it."}
{"text":"Very good place at Paris LAS VEGAS and nice noodle and fried rice after we enjoy two days Hamburg and ice. Hot, warm soup and nice rice. Good service and price middle level. It worth of come again and transportation good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place had really tasty Asian food. I was exhausted and ordered takeout. The hot and sour soup was actually really good. I got a noodle dish that was good but not spectacular. I also got green beans and they were very fresh and cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed this meal especially since it was takeout."}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing! Super sweet and helpful staff. Their manager is awesome and is so cool :)  The food is so yummy. I had the chicken fried rice and it was so yummy and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Get your Chinese food fix in Vegas....  This is a little more than your standard Chinese restaurant.  It's located inside the hard rock hotel which is a little off he strip.  Not pretentious or anything as you're far away from all the other hotels.  Service was nice and food tasted good.  We ordered family style and had a bunch of dishes to share.  Pickled cucumbers starter were great.  Walnut shrimp was different than the usual style, but still good.  Can't remember the rest, but nothing sucked really.    I only wished my whiskey cocktail tasted a little better, but it wasn't terrible.  Bottom line, if you're in the area and craving some tasty Chinese food.....F U."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with my husband here. We were very impressed with the food. Get the udon noodles with shrimp and scallops. Yummm! Service was also very fast and everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  The lobster puff balls are really good!!  Try all the Tapas on the menu!!!  Tony the manager is super friendly and remembers your name and makes you feel right at home! :)"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and loved it. Will definitely go again soon and try out some more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm giving Fu five stars because it flawlessly executes Asian American dining at the right price point. It's not highly authentic being that they cater to western tastes; however, the quality of the ingredients is fantastic and everything that I've tried here has been consistently satisfying. My favorite dishes are the Hong Kong noodles and Kung Pao chicken. I'd definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the Hard Rock as you'll get better value out of Fu than Nobu. Last note - service is very friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Came during my stay in Vegas because of the great reviews for the vegan chickn, let me tell you I was not disappointed! The vegan Kung pao chickn dish was absolutely delicious, and the sauce it was in was amazing. We also ordered the veggie lo mein and veggie egg rolls that were super yummy as well. If you're looking for a good restaurant in Vegas with vegetarian/vegan options give Fu Asian Kitchen a try, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Beef chow fun, Salt and pepper pork, and the roast duck was delicious. I do not advise of the sweet and sour chicken and the calamari."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got such a high rating. Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and got a discount so decided to try this place out. I did not have high expectations and just wanted some basic easy dishes to try. Got the pork chop rice and potstickers.  Tasted worse than Panda Express, the potstickers tasted like they just got it out of a frozen bag and microwaved it, the pork chop rice was a little better but not worth it.  The way I rate on Yelp is mostly weighted on food quality not presentation or atmosphere so zero stars for the food. The service was great. The staff was cool and attentive, place was clean just don't come here thinking they have anything close to real chinese food. The restaurant name really says it all when it comes to the taste. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"I dined here twice - the first time was a to go lunch bowl and we had a sit down dinner last night. My lunch bowl was spicy Kung pao chicken and I ate every bite of it.  Last night we had vegetable spring rolls for an appetizer. Hubby chose the Kung pao chicken and I had shrimp and pork wonton soup with rice noodles.  The portions were decent- hubby ate almost all of his entree and I finished about half of my soup (the bowl was pretty large).  Refills on soda are not free - you will be charged."}
{"text":"Excellent food ..tried the kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, honey walnut shrimp, and shrimp fried rice ...very tasty with high quality ingredients ..service was excellent ..final bill was $75 for four people and we were all stuffed"}
{"text":"Amazing service and on top of that they have vegan dishes on their menu.   Super friendly staff, very attentive and on top of things.   Jason Duran was the manager when we dined and he was friendly and very welcoming.   I'm definitely coming back.  Oh, if possible try the Tiger drink ... So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and thought I would try it. Yelpers were on point with this one. Good Asian fare, reasonably priced and nice portions. Food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering. I will definitely come back. Service was great also. This is a hidden gem in the Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"They're all so sweet here! And they've always been so accommodating with my gluten free food choices. The lettuce wraps are my go to and are soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would! I ate there yesterday at 6pm. Food and service was good. But I got severe food poisoning 11 hrs later. I know it was from here because it was my only meal that day. Massive vomiting and diarrhea so bad I passed out hitting my head and splitting it open. I'm thankful for the 4 firemen who helped my wife. Feeling some better now but I hope the food and beverage director does a better job checking food temp levels before cooking.  For the record I had seafood noodles with extra shrimps and scallops. I think the seafood was bad."}
{"text":"Love it here.  I really love their noodle dishes.  The veggie lo-mein has tender noodles. a slightly sweet sauce and lots of crispy vegetables.  The Chicken with vegetables is outstanding.  The chicken is super tender with crispy veggies as well.  If you're craving asian, this is a beautiful room, with super friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Came here with a bachelorette party (group of 9) on a Saturday night in May and it worked out great. We had tickets to Magic Mike Live at 10:30 so wanted to eat at a restaurant in the Hard Rock Hotel. Fu had really good food that was great for sharing, and our servers were friendly and helpful. I saw some reviews had commented that the service was really slow, and while this wasn't a problem for us there was one time we had to inquire about a dish we had ordered (and we were one of probably 2-3 tables there at the time). Everything we ordered was great, minus the Chinese chicken salad, which I would skip. Crowd pleasers: veggie egg roll, vegetable low mein, and Hong Kong chow mein."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!!! I was at the hard rock hotel and the restaurant was downstairs in the lobby next to nobu. The lady who took my order was the nicest ever. They brought it up to my room. The lady who brought it up was friendly and so nice - we talked about our kids and her living in Vegas. If I was there longer, we would have gone again. Priced well too!"}
{"text":"Lunch Menu is a great deal.  Just the right amount of food with rice included at the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"You have to experience the fu kitchen if you're staying at the Hard Rick or just in Vegas. You will be first greeted by Anna who is the friendliest person you will ever come across. The love that she has for her job carries into the service that is given. Amazing food with a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy it in."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for a date with your sweetie! Very friendly staff! The General's chicken and garlic noodles are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for my food. Talked to the manager and was told, \"yeah, that's about how long it takes when there's a conference in town.\" I don't understand how that's relevant when the restaurant is only half full. She also said the food is coming out slowly because of their limited staff and that all the restaurants are like that at the hotel. How is that possible? Don't hotels book conferences several months (if not longer) in advance?  To make it worse, the food was just alright. The manager ended up comping my entree which is why this review is two stars instead of one. This place is definitely not worth waiting 40 minutes for your food while the restaurant is half empty."}
{"text":"Very fresh and well made Asian cuisine. I went with a classic Chinese dish, beef with broccoli and the broccoli was steamed well and was firm, not mush. The beef was tender and perfectly cooked.  Plus it wasn't swimming in sauce.    We hit it up during a very late lunch and there was only us and another table, so service was great.  Really nice setting.   It was a good experience, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Fu Asian Kitchen is located inside of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. It is on the Casino floor. There is free self park parking available.  They have 4-5 lunch specials. We got the shrimp vegetables and rice along with the salt and broccoli rice. The lunch specials also come with the soup of the day, an egg drop corn chowder. I didn't love the soup, it was on the salty and gelatinous side for me, but I appreciated trying it.  The main dishes were hot and FRESH! The service was excellent. They always had our water glasses filled, brought lemons for our water when we asked, and finished the meal with a delicious cappuccino. They also asked if we needed extra soy sauce, chop sticks, and hot sauce.   Prompt service, fresh food, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid meal!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Asian restaurant located in the Hard Rock Hotel. They are open for lunch and dinner. They have a decent sized seating area.  They also have a room service menu available.  I ordered the Mopo Tofu and it was good. Large portions with a decent side of rice."}
{"text":"TL;DR: very average Asian fusion; similar to greasy Chinese takeout   My friends and I were staying at the Hard Rock and needed a place to quickly go for dinner before heading out. Two of us are vegetarian, so we also didn't want to spend forever looking for a place that had options. We found Fu and decided to go in, but should have been deterred by the empty seats everywhere.   Food: A friend and I split the vegan chicken and vegetable lo mein, both of which were mediocre. The lo mein is a bunch of greasy noodles with a few stalks of broccoli; the vegan chicken is good, but tastes a lot like kung pao chicken would at any regular Chinese takeout spot. It's rather sweet with very bland bell peppers and unseasoned peanuts to accompany. All in all, not worth the money.  Ambiance: In the hard rock hotel, but was quiet when we went. It's dark and meant to have the feel of a more upscale Asian spot, but seeing the slot machines in the doorway beyond makes it very obvious that this is not."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time for dinner. I was not sure on what to order sorry I got a few apps. It was sooo, you have to try all of them. I had steamed edamame, veggie egg rolls, shrimp dumplings and quesadilla with duck and goat cheese"}
{"text":"Me and my mainland chinese friends both like this restaurant...very moderately priced for a casino restaurant...all the dishes are good...waitstaff friendly and attentive.  This is a great option for chinese if you are close to the hard rock casino"}
{"text":"I met my friends here for dinner. I'm vegan and we figured it would be easy for me to find something I could eat at an Asian restaurant. Our server brought me the special vegan menu, which was quite helpful, though I was disappointed that only a few items were vegan, and very few of those didn't have edamame or tofu. (I try to avoid soy.) I ordered the Singapore noodles and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was a sad experience for us. We ordered duck buns and shrimps, but were served half duck, by a different person! I boldly decided to try it out, since I felt like this food would be wasted otherwise. It was a terrible idea. Cinthia argued that we got cheaper Dish (25$ vs 35$ for buns), so we ended up paying additionally 2$ for buns. Meat was full of bones and fat, no vegies on a side at all. Sauce was terribly sweet. The only tasting thing was actually buns, but we are barely full.   Both dishes came with a side of rice, which was neither written nor told.    We paid 55$ for 2 dishes, so I guess $$ rating is misleading.   Overall, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Went here around 3 pm on a weekday, wasn't busy at all with maybe 15% of the tables being used.  Was sat down quickly and given a drinks menu but not a food menu.  I waited 5 minutes while employee after employee walked by, doing other things.  Even met eyes with some of them.  Nobody offered me a drink or a menu.  Ok, fuck you then.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So my friends and I stopped by here for dinner during our Vegas trip. I was really glad that they had a separate gluten free menu. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai which was delicious. The drinks were good. But the reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because the service was extremely slow! The restaurant wasn't crowded the night we went. I would say there was maybe 6 tables occupied but for some reason, it took a long time to get our food, drinks, and finally our bill."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the 1st time. Wow. Food was delicious. I had the Seabass. It was fresh. I tried the Rasberry Belgiam beer and that was yummy. Service was great. Love the decorations."}
{"text":"I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.  The food at Fu is floating around the rankings of P.F. Chang's. Given the choice between the two, I would choose P.F. Chang's though.  The Chinese horoscope themed drinks were good. They were strong for fruity concoctions.  We ordered two types of edamame to snack on while we waited for out order to arrive. One regular with salt and one with a spicy seasoning. The spicy one was pretty good, not too spicy, but flavorful.  We also had the crispy vegetable egg rolls. They were tasty and perfectly fried.  For my main dishes I had the garlic green beans, garlic noodles, and the duck. They were all alright, they could have used a little more flavor. I would still order them all again as is though.  The service was nice as well. Someone at our table didn't quite understand the complexities of the lazy Susan and ended up spilling a glass of water into my duck. They staff immediately cleaned it up and brought a new plate of duck.  There are so many better options to eat at Vegas, but if you have to eat at the Hard Rock Hotel, Fu isn't too bad of an option."}
{"text":"Very good service and excellent food and a reasonable price FOR being inside a major casino.  Lunch was $12.95 and very good.  Generals Chicken was top notch.  Sweet and spicy.  Atmosphere was very nice as well.  Waitresses were super friendly ans on the ball.  Frankly, this was a surprise for being inside the Hard Rock Casino.  Main surprise was the affordable price and the fact that it was top notch Chinese food.   I recommend to anyone who want a great Chinese lunch for under $20.  Obviously that is rare in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ended up here before going to see a show at the Hard Rock. Seating was readily available in this quiet, intimate Chinese restaurant. The server took our drink order, disappeared, then came back again to ask for our IDs. The cocktails are all named after different animals. I ordered a pineapple mojito (the animal name eludes me in this moment) but unfortunately the mint overpowered the drink. The the server took our dinner order... but had to come back moments later to confirm. We got crab Rangoon and the lettuce wraps - super tasty! We really enjoyed the accompanying sauces. One of us ordered from the gluten free menu, and they cooked it to his request. Two of us ordered seafood dishes and we absolutely loved them. The portions are huge and there is a perfect mix of seafood and veggies: the three different types of mushrooms were especially tasty. The scallops melted in my mouth! We were sitting finishing up our beers and raving about how great this place was when I spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall just above the server's station. I was so ready to come back to this place, and I know that this is the desert where cockroaches naturally live, but the insect sighting left a metaphorical bad taste in my mouth. All in all, service was satisfactory, food portions were large, cocktails were interesting in variety -- I hope I can bring myself to look past the critter on the wall and come back sometime."}
{"text":"We tried out Fu because we got a coupon upon check in and decided to give it a try. The food is excellent. The fun noddles were absolutely delicious as were the steamed buns. My boyfriend had Kung pao chicken and said it was amazing. We started with fun unique cocktails. Our server was extremely friendly and super attentive which really made it a nice experience. Definitely share items or order one by one because the portions are enough to share."}
{"text":"I love this little gem inside the hard rock. Every year I stay at the hard rock for a convention and there's only a few places I enjoy eating regularly at the hotel and FU is one of them. The Kalbi tacos on the magic mike menu are so flavorful. Other favorites are the duck salad, the tuna salad, garlic green beans, and lettuce cups. Oh and the hot and sour soup!!! So good! The service is very friendly and they even have a vegan menu option. I will definitely be back next year!"}
{"text":"Food is super tasty and beautifully presented, service is very nice!  Came here early for dinner one night on a weekday and the restaurant wasn't busy, but towards later in the evening, the restaurant was full. So come early. The drinks menu has the 12 Chinese zodiac themed cocktails which was super cool. Just find the year you were born and order the drink that correspond to your year.   Our server was very nice and gave us a bunch of recommendations on the menu items and also explained the menu and portion sizes. We ordered a bunch of small plate appetizers to share as tapas style. The menu is extensive and the choices is abundant, anything your heart desires. Out of the 6 appetizers we ordered, EVERYTHING was delicious!! There was not a single dish I didn't like. Duck quesadillas were super tasty, the jicama and mango salsa was perfect. The minced thai lettuce wrap and the ahi tuna shrimp lettuce wrap were both delicious with perfect flavoring. Crab cakes were also super tasty and full of real crab meat. Calamari steaks with jalapeno was flavored beautifully, and we got a sushi roll that was full of fresh fish and no rice for those of us on a low carb diet. Well I was also saving my carbs for dessert which we got the variety mochi ice cream and my favorite the fried banana with vanilla bean ice cream. yum!  Service was superb, sweet and attentive. Bathroom is outside of the restaurant in the casino. Great experience, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was seeing my boy Bo Burham in concert and needed some place at Hard Rock to eat, decided to stop by the Fu Asian Kitchen. The waiters here are very helpful, I tried to order the dry scallops and the waiter saw how white I was and advised against it. Ended up feasting on the cashew chicken, also their cocktails come in hella awesome mugs."}
{"text":"Ok so it's not like this place has killer Chinese food, but I just like it because I go to Vegas and stay at the Hard Rock Hotel here and there, and this place is a decent substitute for Chinese food while I get a little \"home sick\" for it. If it was located anywhere else, like NYC I would have probably given this place 3 stars in terms of food, but since it's Vegas and I'm in the middle of the desert, this is probably as good as it's going to get.   The portions are great. The price is reasonable. The service is decent. I like to sit down and eat here to take a break from the rowdiness of \"Vegas\". It seems very clean.   I like getting the pickled green shredded pork noodle soup. It's pretty Chinese, hard to go wrong with it."}
{"text":"The only reason I came to this spot was because a close friend of mine recommended it to me. I thought it was just like any other Asian restaurant, but I was completely surprised by how amazing the food tasted. Now it's a go to spot in Vegas for me if I'm craving Asian American cuisine even if it's a little out of the way.  I highly recommend getting their baby back pork ribs with honey plum glaze and I assure you its going to knock your socks off. I wished I ordered more because we had to split 4 pieces monster the three of us. Another plate worth mentioning is their pan fried shrimp dumplings which is the dim sum dish with whole shrimp in a translucent wrapper better known as Har Gow was the best I've ever had at any restaurant. You can taste the quality over cheaper dim sum places I've been to and by adding that crunch factor it was top notch. All the dishes I had here exceeded my expectations and to top it off the service fantastic. Our waitress gave us helpful recommendations that led to a very memorable dining experience in Vegas and it didn't hurt that she was cute too ;)"}
{"text":"I had the sea bass in lettuce cups and the duck quesadilla.  Both were out of the box amazing along with their twist on the cucumber salad. Everyone is so pleasant from the front to the back. Theresa was especially sweet and very helpful. The dining room appears to be small but there is a huge back part they open for big parties and when the hotel is full and busy. Im going to try their sweet and sour chicken next time."}
{"text":"Manager/Owner Theresa turned a bad experience into a wonderful one. We are Vegan and went to FU for lunch on our Anniversary. They were out of the \"meat\" to make the Vegan Kung Pao (which was the reason we went there). Decided to just go to Chinatown for Vegan Thai when the manager and co-owner Theresa came over. We talked about our experience there as well as another time when we wanted to go their that they happened to be closed but didn't mention it on their website. Theresa asked if she could have her chef prepare several Off Menu items that would be Vegan. We reluctantly agreed. The Chef did a wonderful job creating Vegan Lettuce Wraps, Vegan Vegetable/Tofu Curry and Vegan Lo Mein. The waiter was excellent and I cannot recommend the service and food enough. Very few professionals take the time to do what Theresa and her staff did and they turned a situation where we would have never gone back, to one where we felt very good, enjoyed the food thoroughly and feel like we should let the world know through Yelp. Thank you Theresa, your professionalism is appreciated and we are excited about going back. Add those items to the new \"Vegan Menu\" at FU. Thank you."}
{"text":"Who knew that some of the best Asian food was at the Hard Rock Hotel and not on Spring Mountain Road.  Chef Ming See Woo is turning out amazing dishes with lots of flavor and an abundance of creativity.  Two of us had a tasting of several of her items.  She had determined the menu in advance and we chose a few dishes off the menus.  Items we tried:  Sizzling rice seafood soup Mustard greens with salty egg and pork soup Duck quesadilla with goat cheese Miso sea bass in lettuce cups Four dim sum dishes--pork bun, pan fried pot sticker, Siu Mai, and har gow. Honey walnut prawn Baby back rib with honey plum glaze Crispy Japanese calamari with five spice, salt and pepper, and jalapeño Drunken crab with rice wine dipping sauce Peking duck with vegetables, bao, and duck sauce Beef tenderloin with spicy Fú sauce and rice cake Lobster in sake butter sauce Pepper spice chicken with chili XO shrimp Honey walnut shrimp Garlic egg noodles White chocolate bread pudding Chocolate mousse with chocolate pieces and Mandarin orange Oreo beignets Crispy banana spring rolls with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce  I cannot point out one dish that was not up to par but there were several standouts.  The XO shrimp were on a different menu that's given to their Asian guests.  The XO shrimp is outstanding and can be ordered anytime.  The lobster is pricey but it is excellent.  Served with the garlic egg noodles, it's an excellent dish.  The sake butter sauce was superb.  The mustard greens soup--also on the Asian menu--was excellent.  The duck quesadilla was an interesting twist that shows why Fú bills itself as a fusion restaurant.  The honey walnut shrimp were outstanding and was the beef tenderloin.  I know I'm listing everything that we tried, but it was all very good.  Finally, the desserts were great.  Oreo beignets with chocolate sauce and crispy banana spring rolls with ice cream.  Chocolate mousse and white chocolate bread pudding.  Desserts don't get much better than this.  Service was excellent.  Serving plates were replaced after each round and we were given fresh, large-sized wet napkins in wrapper to keep our fingers clean from the finger food.  Our cloth napkins were also changed halfway through the meal.  This was an outstanding experience.  Chef Woo is really doing some great things at Fú!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! We stayed at the Hard Rock and after a long period of partying and not eating, came here for sustenance. Tried the shrimp/green beans, General Tso's chicken, fried rice and Wonton soup. Everything was really good. Large portions. Oh and the cold leftovers that night and the next morning? AMAZING."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good.  A bit pricey, but if I'm at the Hard Rock for an event for a few days... I will be dining here."}
{"text":"Be warned of you have Celiac's do not eat here! We stayed at the Hard Rock for my sister's Bachelorette Party and ate at Fu Saturday night and had a horrible experience.   We specifically alerted the waiters that our bride has Celiac's and can not have gluten. They assured us the Pad Tai noodles are gluten free after eating some the bride started to feel sick. We asked the waiter if he was certain the dish was indeed gluten free, he said he would check. When he returned to our table he said \"no the dish is full of gluten... No just kidding\" this response was completely rude, insensitive and uncalled for.   This completely ruined the rest of our weekend as the bride was throwing up and in pain. We were unable to go to XS to see Zedd and use our prepaid passes. This experience was horrible and ruined half of our trip!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, they are always so polite to me when I go there. Very respectful, well mannered people. The food  is also very delicious, live their wonton soup and fried rice....."}
{"text":"Las Vegas restaurants are so expensive that we were thrilled to find somewhere with great food and reasonable prices.  We ordered the General's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice.  See a trend here?????   Anyway, everything came out hot and fresh and not in a \"hurry and eat so we can turn your table kind of way\".  The General's Chicken was somewhat similar to General Tso's but it wasn't deep fried, but skinless.   Great sauce and the right temperature.   King Pao was the same way, very tasty and the right heat.   If anything, the rice might have been a little bland but they give you two sauces (hot and hotter) which added a punch.  Our server was great and the prices were what we see at home so we were pleasantly surprised.  Would go back."}
{"text":"I've been to FU 2x now and both times I have been pretty happy with the food and service. Both times I dined there, I had shrimp dumplings that were beautiful and delicious! Along side I had Ox-Tail soup that was delicious.. and another time I enjoyed pad thai.. so the place specializes in Asian fare from many styles.  Both times I ate there.. it was with a friend , and both times the bill was around $60 for both of us. So its not extremely expensive, but its not cheap... Though overall its a good quality product they serve so that makes it even more worth it. I am sure I will be back for more of something sooner or later as it is in my neighborhood.. until then.. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This was a perfect experience. Friendly AMD considering staff, perfectly cooked dishes, good choice, reasonable prizes. Only thing they can work on is the ambiance. It's not an very inviting place to stay longer. A little bit to bright light, empty.   We were here before an show, so a little bit in a hurry. Which was no problem. The signaled the kitchen so everything was out on time. With a big excuse. Because of the small time frame the Peking Duck was prepared in the Kitchen instead at the table. For us that was fine.   My husband had an excellent choice with the Peking Duck. I had a similar experience with the tenderloin with mixed mushrooms. WoW. A real big variety of more exclusive mushrooms. Big chunks of soft tenderloin and a big bowl of rice (which I didn't ate, too much).   We'll definitely be back when we visite the Hardrock."}
{"text":"I gave two stars because my appetizer was decent.   However, my main course was the duck with plum sauce and I had to send it back because it was too cold. I honestly wasn't going to say anything but I think our waitress saw my face when I took my first bite. My friend and I got the same thing and hers was also cold and when we received them back, they were both lukewarm at best, rubbery and tough to chew.   We didn't eat anymore and they removed both of the ducks from our bill. The service was really good and my other friend enjoyed her sweet and sour chicken so I suggest going with another entree than the duck and you might enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very quiet place to have dinner in Vegas. It's great for big groups who want a little privacy but still be around other customers. The service was great and the food was even better. I highly recommend their sweet and sour soup and their pad thai."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times, and had a variety of entrees and appetizers. My only complaint is with the Wor Wonton Soup. Although very tasty, it was luke warm at best. Other than that, I enjoyed the food. Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"In the hard rock. Nice menu alil pricy but hey it's vegas. We had fried rice, pad thai and cocktails. The food was good and fresh. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My daughter and are super grateful for this restaurant. I've been craving Kung Pao Chicken since I began my lifestyle as a vegan.   We arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel hangry, tired, and a bit nervous. Our daughter had a dance competition that weekend.   We were amazed that this restaurant actually a vegan section on their menu. I literally felt like Mushu's spirit was guiding me there that day.  My daughter who is also a vegan ordered the Kung Pao vegan too. Fu Asian Kitchen became or go to place for our entire stay at The Hard Rock.  We were able to relax in their comfortable dining room. Our waiter was very friendly.  Don't come to this restaurant expecting to eat authentic Asian cuisine. They are a happy medium between authentic and Americanized Asian cuisine.   Cons- 1. No vegan broth or soups.  Pros- 1. Convenient location if you're staying at the HRH Tower. 2. Homemade vegan protein. 3. All fresh ingredients. 4. Large portions. 5. Offer brown rice. 6. Tasty and a wide range of Asian dishes. 7. Very friendly staff and attentive. 8. Clean and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"I had a delicious meal (Udon with shrimp & veggie tempura) and wonderful service. The meal was filling, abundant portion size and very fairly priced. I'm staying at the hotel for work and this was a great find only steps from my room!"}
{"text":"This was a great find thanks to the other wonderful Yelp reviews! The service we received was astounding. The server was very friendly, prompt and was extremely efficient. He had answers to all of our questions and had great suggestions on different menu items to try. The wife and I were both very pleased with both of our dishes and would easily rate them top 2 of any Chinese style restaurant food we've ever had. She had the Hong Kong Chow Mein, I had the Orange Peel Beef, both had wonderful flavor and the meat was very tender. The Chow Mein sauce was thick and flavorful, vegetables were cooked perfectly. The Orange beef had a great flavor with not too much orange.  They had some lunch specials so that was nice on the wallet. Typical plate pricing was around $18, lunch specials were 12ish making this place a great spot to stop. Definitely keeping this place as a 'go-to' next time we're in town and can't decide where to eat!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was even better. We came for my niece's birthday and they were great. I'm so glad Richard G. recommended the fried rice with pork and shrimp.... Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here taste good. I like the Mongolian beef the most, but whatever you order. It will be great. The service is beyond and great! I will be back ~_~"}
{"text":"Why don't they just call this Chinese Kitchen? In my opinion, 90% of the menu is filled with Chinese food and the other 10% are random quote on quote \"Asian\" dishes. It would feel more authentic if they classified themselves as an Chinese restaurant rather than categorizing themselves as an \"Asian\" restaurant. Anyhow, we stumbled into this restaurant after running out of options at the Hard Rock.   I ordered the Cashew Chicken with steam rice. The chicken and vegetables in it was extremely salty. Also there was barely any cashews in it. My meal was quite disappointing but luckily our waitress was very friendly and prompt with her services. Otherwise I would've given Fu Asian Kitchen two stars instead of three. I don't think I'll return to give this restaurant another try."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome and very helpful - food was delicious and a great value compared to Nobu"}
{"text":"This restaurant had very authentic food and the prices we're reasonable! The food was delicious"}
{"text":"We ordered the cashew chicken and combo chow mein. Chow mein is the crispy noodle kind. Very good. Came with chicken,shrimp,scallops and pork. Cashew chicken was loaded with chicken, unlike some places that put more vegis in it. I highly recommend this place. Top quality ingredients and tastes fresh. Wish more places were like this."}
{"text":"I was shocked that great chinese food existed on the Las Vegas Strip area. The fusion of all the flavors of the orient come together in harmony here at FU in the Hard Rock Hotel.   The chicken fried rice was very simple, yet delicious. The kung pao chicken was nice and sweet with a little bit of tang and spicyness. I really enjoyed the dragon shrimp. Big jumbo shrimp with water chestnuts and broccoli, coated in a sweet citrus sauce...TO DIE FOR! The cocktail I had was called \" Monkey\". It was made with gin and cucumber lemon water, topped with club soda...very refreshing!  Very hip and trendy spot. Loved the Asian decor. Our waiter was very polite and friendly. Highly recommend this spot. It is truly a hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great meal with a small group. Nice round tables with a glass lazy Susan in the middle excellent for sharing small bites or more. Our group had Peking Duck, Pho Vermicelli w beef, basil Shrimp and Sea Bass. We shared a seafood fried rice and a few other bits. Service was good atmosphere great. Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"I actually really love this place i must say ....this is seriously some of my fave asian food ...evrything is so good"}
{"text":"The night after New Years and it's pretty relaxed right now. Not too busy not too slow.  I went Korea and had amazing dim sum, BUT THIS BETTER! I want to eat more and come back again and again. This has to be one of the best if not the best dim sum and pot stickers I've ever eaten.  This is an amazing restaurant you have to visit in Las Vegas.   Dim Sum sampler $10 - Must have.  Pot stickers $10 - Must have."}
{"text":"Sea bass is excellent. Pepper beef was great except for my broccoli wasn't cooked all the way. I would like to try some of the appetizers next time if I ever come back."}
{"text":"Over the top perfection. We used to go to the Mayflower on the west side and felt a hurt when they moved to the strip, but the pilgrimage to the Hard Rock was well worth it. Try the veggie kung pao chicken. You will not believe it isn't chicken. Bar is over the top fantastic. Very knowledgeable wait staff, aimed to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. Salmon in basil cream, garlic noodles and miso cod will satisfy all, but do try the veggie kung pao chicken!"}
{"text":"This is a nice intimate Chinese restaurant that's located inside the Hard Rock Casino. The food here was very tasty, and on point with authentic Chinese cuisine. I especially liked the vegetable lo mein. It was flavorful, with crisp vegetables and perfectly cooked noodles. Also, the potstickers and crab rangoon's were an excellent choice for appetizers. The service was quick and friendly. I did also try the Kung pao chicken. I would say this was not one of my favorites, as it was not very spicy at all. The general's chicken was a much better choice. Overall a good meal experience!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Asian cuisine in Vegas. Nothing on the menu will disappoint. Fried Rice is amazing. General TSO's is out of this world and the Sweet and Sour Chicken and Mongolian Beef are to die for. Portion size are great as they are large and great for family dining.  For Vegas, pricing is fantastic. For a party of 5 grubbing it down, we paid $85 and had a ton of leftovers.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with friendly staff. Food is well prepared and looks as good as it tastes.   Prices are a bit higher than I'd expect for Asian cuisine, but then everything here seems to cost a bit more.   Nice collection of Chinese zodiac cocktails, wine and beers (including Asian beers)"}
{"text":"The service here is extraordinary. The staff here really took extra steps to make sure we were taken care of. Our server was friendly, sweet and very soft spoken.   (We ordered shrimp dumplings and some chicken pho.)  They made the chicken pho for us even though they only have beef on their menu. The food came out in a timely manner and the manager, Tony, brought us our pho and asked if we would like him to split it for us. We said yes please and he filled our two smaller bowls for us which was very sweet. He made polite small talk and was very observant over our table to make sure we had everything we needed.  The dumplings were the best I've ever had and that's saying a lot since we eat a lot of pho across the country. Some people may not like the doughy texture but if you like it like I do, order it as is and if not, ask for them to make it crispier!   Our pho bowl was $14 and we were able to refill our small bowls 4 times and got super full between the two of us. We will definitely be back here more during our stay this week at Hard Rock! I'm sure after some partying, this place will be the perfect hangover cure!"}
{"text":"Wow - I am so surprised at the reviews of FU. I am glad I didn't read them before we decided to try it out this past weekend. The food was excellent, the service was amazing and the server we had was very knowledgeable of the better dishes on the menu. We ordered the Thai Spicy Basil Chicken lettuce wraps, which were spicy and the flavor was excellent. The Curry Lobster puffs were a little less spicy, but excellent option that reminded me of the Crab & cream cheese wontons of the regular Chinese restaurants only better. Then for dinner we had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was excellent as well. The portions are larger family style so there is plenty to share between two people. The rice was soft and fluffy as well (unlike one of the previous reviews). We did not have dessert but I did try the Year of the Dog cocktail which was yummy as well.  With our experience, it is shocking to have read the other reviews. Maybe they took a look at the reviews and up'ed the anti on their service & the quality of the food. Hopefully there will be more good reviews in their future."}
{"text":"I am big fan of this restaurant. I feel bad that it does not get as many guest as it deserves.  It has a great service and a good selection with awesome hospitality.  I stopped by for lunch and got two dishes for under $20 and the food came out quick.  The server was awesome and the ambiance was chill.  FU in Chinese means good fortune for anyone who doesn't know that and it was good fortune for me.  I got the lunch special Sweet and Sour Pork and the the lobster crab ragoon.  Both were yummy and I even had enough for left overs.  dp"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and very professional- my server, was very knowledgeable of the menu and  was able to make some very good recommendations. I only wish I would have taken all of his suggestions and not ventured on my own.... The two tapas dishes he recommended, the squid/shrimp and pot stickers were amazing, the  edamame was horrible though- under cooked, no flavor whatsoever even though I ordered the spicy. I had three pods, pushed it aside and moved on. The bus boy must know this dish is frequently disregarded, because he was quick to remove the audacious presentation from my table. Fu's pot stickers were, themselves, somewhat under-seasoned, but the vinegar-ginger sauce for dipping provided a wonderful ascension to the dish. The  hosin accompanied duck that I had for my entree was well above average: cooked to perfection and flavorful, the hosin sauce tasted manufactured, however, it was still a terrific condiment. The \"Chinese pancakes\" were spongy and not over steamed, but exaggerated how filling the meal was. Overall, a great hint of elegance for the Hard Rock Hotel, but not up to the expectations that had been set by the hotel staff and the overly praising reviews I had read both on Yelp and Online."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the service is top notch. The food was devine. The selection on the menu is just right too."}
{"text":"What a gem. To  my surprise, we've found a place to satisfy our asian food cravings in the heart of Las Vegas! Our whole experience at Fu Asian Kitchen was great, and they've found a creative way to serve asian fusion dishes to satisfy any appetite.   Our original thought was to order the typical rice and noodle dishes. However, we were steered towards the tapas menu and decided to share 6 tapas amongst 2 people, which was the perfect amount. The kitchen served our dishes in sets of 2, making it a 3 course meal.  Korean tacos (from the nightly special menu)      - My favorite dish of the meal. At $6 for 2 tacos, it was quite a bargain. The Korean meat,                      spicy sauce and kimchi ratio perfectly compliment each other   Miso Sea Bass in Lettuce Cups      - The sea bass melts in your mouth.   Crab Cakes with Wasabi Aioli       - I could have done without the wasabi aioli on top, but the crab cakes were fluffy and filling  Tuna Tartare, Shrimp & Avocado Lettuce Wraps     - A bit repetitive since we also got the sea bass lettuce cups, but the tuna was fresh and tastefully seasoned   Baby Back Pork Ribs with Honey Plum Glaze      - Love the sauce, the ribs could have been more tender. They pulled off the bone easily but the meat wasn't as soft as I had hoped  Crispy Japanese Calamari      - Loved it. The 5 spice seasoning and cucumbers created the perfect balance on this dish.  For dessert, we got the mochi ice cream and chocolate beignets. The mochi layer of the ice cream was a bit odd and rubbery. However, the chocolate beignets were amazing. I would come back just for them. I was beyond full at this point but couldn't let these beauties go to waste."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing food and excellent service. My boyfriend agreed that it was the best and quickest lunch we've ever had, so that's saying something. We will definitely be back! Thank you for having such an excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate my Birthday here.I told 3 people that I have a birthday and not only people didn't say something simple like 'Happy Birthday' but didn't even offer a complimentary desert as all restaurants do.Food wasn't very tasty either,tea tasted like water(6$).This place is empty and now I understand why.Not welcoming,staff is not trainer.I wish I celebrated my special day somewhere else."}
{"text":"The staff was great and attentive. Atmosphere is relaxing and conveniently located. The food was was not good in the slightest. I had the war wanton soup. The shrimp was not fresh and tasted fishy. The pork was tough and had a weird flavor. I was to afraid to sample the chicken. The broth was the only thing good about the soup. I stay at the Hard Rock hotel about 15 times per year and this was my first and last time eating at FU."}
{"text":"Fu which means good luck in Chinese, just recently opened at Hard Rock Hotel. This   establishment serves authentic Chinese food along with other Asian inspired foods such as Vietnamese and Thai, but mostly Chinese.   This is located inside the new section of Hard Rock Hotel.  The atmosphere of Fu had an Asian modern feel.  Food:  Things we ordered were;  Jelly Fish, which was delicious.   The Duck, roasted to perfection, giving it's natural juices an appealing taste was you chew in your mouth.  Pork, which was tender and juicy  Noodles for long life.  Shrimp with some kind of BBQ sauce.  and of course the fried rice.  The Chinese food was  a bit too authentic for me but i still enjoyed it and would love to bring my friends here for real authentic Chinese food.  The service in Fu was great! The waiters were all tentative. If they noticed your plate was too dirty they would change it right away.  This restaurant is a casual/fine dining service.  Try this place out now if your into authentic Chinese. I must warn you this place is nothing like Pf Chang's."}
{"text":"I usually write lengthy, detailed reviews but for this place, I can't. I just simply need to say - GO!! GO HERE! Delish!!   They say the food is served \"family style,\" but yeahhhh, I wasn't sharing. I didn't need to. It was enough food for me, myself and I even though four of us were at the table! LOL.   Shrimp and Scallop Sizzle - or whatever it's called, YES!!! Huge pieces of shrimp, scallop, and eggplant.    Seafood Fried Rice w/Crispy Garlic - ABSOLUTELY!! I had some leftover but not much. I did let a friend take a spoonful. She was just as pleased as I was.   Cucumber Salad - While I expected cucumber circles, we received cucumber wedges almost. The dressing was divine!!   Yep - GO HERE and get what I got! You won't be sorry. Oh wait, some may say it was too salty. NOT FOR ME! It was just perfect!"}
{"text":"there should be space for 4.5 stars because this was excellent but not \"as good as it gets\". went here because i had a casino dining credit that I had to use. Wasnt expecting much but the food was delicious. The pepper steak was succulent pieces of steak cooked to perfection. The mapo tofu was about 8/10 delicious indeed. Service was prompt. Im a fan I can't wait for my next casino comp! really suprised anyone could give this less than 4 stars it really was a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"1 star - martini took 20 minutes.  Associate ordered beer: took 20 or so minutes - we came to conclusion that they must have been brewing it in the back therefore the long wait.  Customer service 2 1/2.   4 1/2 stars food - Food was delish - Sea Bass was fall apart in your mouth amazing. That is what really matters I suppose anyway. I would come again but never going to order a drink - instead just food."}
{"text":"2 stars for the service n decor...If you want Chinese food, you could do better with any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. To do Fusion well, you first have to do authentic well.  For the price you'd expect something more but no such (Fu) luck after dining here 2x...the food is just not very special. It might be because being in a hotel they are catering to the visitors and consistency do not matter much...too bad for us locals."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and had to take a group of 20 out for dinner. Since we were at the Hard Rock and Aria was rated pretty high, we gave it a shot. Restaurant was decent sized and the decor was simple. Met up with the lead waiter that was going to take care of us and we worked out the plans for dinner. I did not want the guests to worry about dinner choices so I have the waiter a dollar amount per person and away he went! A short while later food started coming out from the kitchen, some common and some never before ordered.  The food never stopped, appetizer after appetizer, entree after entree, side dish after side dish, the food never stopped! Delicious too! We had chicken, beef, pork and seafood. Vegetables of all types as well as noodles and rice. Customers were blown away and so was I!! Outstanding job by the wait staff and the kitchen. Had so much food left over and this was a. Group of big eaters! Will definitely be back!! Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The food was great we had the chicken fried rice,  generals chicken and cream cheese won tons! All the food was great chicken was amazing huge chunks of chicken. The rice was awesome. The restaurant was very nice. Wait staff was friendly we had a great experience. This really elevated Chinese food for me, not at all like your local Chinese food delivery place!!"}
{"text":"For this price I expect good service and food. Unfortunately both are bad. First, we have got wrong type of duck, and they charged us for buns which should be included. No more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Fu restaurant inside HardRock Hotel and Casino on Valentine's day. We received excellent service, it seemed everyone was working together. We had several servers check up on us during dinner. I ordered the Korean bbq beef, it was delicious! My husband got the chicken and green beans. He enjoyed it. My daughter ordered the garlic noodles, they were very garlicky. We love garlic! We were all very pleased with the service and food at Fu!"}
{"text":"I like the food here a lot. I've been 2 times so far, and each time, the food was a cut above the run of the mill offerings in this food genre. In fact, if I was rating the food alone, this would have been a solid 4. They lost a star however, due to the service. The first time, I thought it was a fluke, so I held off on the review until having the chance to visit them again, but the second time was no better. It's not that it was bad service by any means, it was what I would call weird service. The first time, we got a very pleasant Asian waiter, who was friendly, attentive, and barely spoke a lick of English. Which was charming at first, but when 3 different dishes came out that were not what we ordered, charming quickly became annoying. The second time, we got an English speaking waiter, who was just a little \"off\". It's hard to say what went wrong, and I hesitate to call someone overly-attentive, but they were oddly-overly-attentive, hovering around the table, breaking into our conversations too frequently, and two times, he tried to grab my drink before I was finished. I hate that. In any case, it's a 4 for the food, but the service dragged it down to a 3. I will go back though. It's brand new, and if they read their online reviews, they will get better at what they do. I would still recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"With the recent acquisition of The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino by Sir Richard Branson it seems a property already undergoing great change will quickly get a major facelift, everything from the gaming floor to pools, clubs and Restaurants said to be in consideration with FU Asian Kitchen likely to be lost in the shuffle and thus providing fans as well as those who've never been an impetus to go soon.  Owned and operated by Hard Rock, but in reality the domain of Chef Ming See Woo who has been at the property since 2012, FU represents the latest chapter in a career that dates back to 1976 when Woo and her husband opened Mayflower Chinese on Paradise Road, a brief retirement proving unfulfilling and her home at the Casino also on Paradise continuing to outperform expectations even now in 2018.  Last visited almost exactly two years prior, an ever-youthful appearing Ming See still working in the kitchen most days and the space largely unchanged, it was alongside one first-timer that a rounded booth was taken just prior to 5:30pm on Saturday, a pre-show surge in traffic briefly filling seats to about 50% around six but the Restaurant otherwise offering peace and quiet throughout the two and a half hour meal.  Located just past the main entrance of The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, MB Steak and Oyster Bar both opened between visits along with a Magic Mike show that has contributed some Happy-Hour Tapas to the Menu, it was after perusing a list of Cocktails based on signs of the Chinese Zodiac that two were selected to start, the current year's Dog smooth and creamy which proved well-suited to both Spicy Tuna Tartare on pan-seared Rice as well as Tacos placing marinated Beef atop fiery Kimchee.  Allowing Chef Woo to dictate the course of the evening, a choice to adhere to the current menu rather than several unique specials offered last time likely a result of the unexpected rush, it was prior to more Appetizers that a sizable Salad topped with Duck and Oranges arrived, the flavor profile sweet yet pleasant while Potstickers served in follow-up outpaced those from Send Noodles as well as Jasmine by a substantial margin despite their similar or lower cost.  Checked on frequently by servers, a second round of Drinks highlighted by the Fruit-forward Horse while an Ox hit hard with Vodka and Soju, it was here that the menu turned toward sharable Entrees including tender Sirloin on a bed of Broccoli with rich FU Sauce, the Fried Salmon at its side an unexpected surprise that managed to wow by way of crispy Skin and Flesh that appeared only lightly kissed by heat at the center.  Somewhat glad to have declined Rice as far more than necessary would have been used to soak up vibrant Thai Basil Sauce, the veteran move a saving of stomach capacity for two additional plates, it was once again that FU's Walnut Shrimp stood out by way of citrusy Mayonnaise that plays well of candied Nuts and light Tempura while stir-fried Udon delighted by being springy and slick with the umami-rich mix of Shrimp, Scallops, Peppers, Snap Peas, Soy and Mushrooms.  Using less hotel music than memory suggests, the dimmed environs thus perfect for lingering over Coffee or Drinks, it was alongside the Mojito-inspired \"Sheep\" that Espresso from Illy arrived, Woo's impressive Bread Pudding 86ed as it does not have a long enough shelf-life for the Restaurant's volume and unfortunately replaced by lackluster Mochi with Paraffin-eque shells served on a platter next to Banana Spring Rolls and Oreo Cookies that have been Tempura battered and Fried.  ***1/2:  A step back from two-years prior, the rumored closure of this and other Hard Rock Hotel & Casino venues to make way for Virgin's big plans likely at least partially responsible, there nonetheless remain plenty of good reasons to visit FU soon, not the least of which being Chef Ming See herself...though who knows, maybe she'll end up somewhere else on Paradise Road or at one of the property's new Restaurants as she still appears healthy and happy behind the stove."}
{"text":"After my trip to China, I went here with the family for a graduation dinner celebration.  The place is modern and clean.  The place was empty.  We got a bunch of entrees to share: Hong Kong Chow Mein, Tropical Fried Rice, Beef with Broccoli, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Wok-Fired Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce and Chicken with Mixed Veggies.  I liked the Salmon with Thai Basil Sauce - it was breaded and crispy fried and the sauce was good. Everything else tasted alright.  You can get better tasting food for much less in Chinatown.  The desserts were pretty good.  We had the mango pudding - tasted like real mangoes instead of fake medicine-tasting garbage.  We also got the banana spring rolls with ice cream.  I feel bad for the hostess wearing a cheong sam.  One passerby was like \"you're not even Chinese! You're Mexican!\"  Yup, this is faux Chinese/ faux Asian at its finest!"}
{"text":"Slightly biased with prices since I can get it discounted - but nonetheless, I would still return.  Usually when you enter, the restaurant is pretty empty but the quality of the food is there. Definitely similar to a PF Chang's (not that I've tried but from friends who have) and prices could be a little steep or standard for hotel dining.   Lunch Specials, comes with soup, side or rice and couple pieces of Chinese Broccoli  --- $9.99 I believe and I would recommend the General's Chicken(it's technically better Orange Chicken from Panda Express with more sauce and a bit more spicy flavor). Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef are also available.   The Miso Glazed Sea Bass is also nomz  -- a bit pricey, $27 but it is delicious.   General's Chicken -- about $15-$17 for dinner, entree items are along this price range too  Garlic Noodles -- $9, very simple dish that comes with no veggies except chopped green onions... but it's absolutely one of my faves  Wonton Noodle Soup -- around $10 to $12, a bit pricer but pretty good - similar to ones at Chinese Noodle Cafes  Skip the HK style Fried Noodles, Beef Hor Fun, Spicy Sichuan Beef Noodle Soup and Potstickers though  Will be back and would take friends here!"}
{"text":"Of course, since it's an Asian restaurant, I wasn't worried that they wouldn't have vegan options. Their website touts a kung pao vegan \"chicken.\" I didn't see it on the menu, so instead of asking, because I was ravenous at the time, I ordered the kung pao tofu. I asked if it had vegetables. 'Red and green peppers.' I wanted more vegetables. He added broccoli to it for me! I love broccoli. There were a handful of other vegetarian options as well. This dish was VERY saucy, perhaps a little too saucy, but it was tasty.  The dishes come with white rice. I asked for brown. It's not true brown rice. It must have been that 5% brown I've heard about. I almost couldn't tell the difference between the brown and the white rice that came with my boyfriend's chicken entree (which was much healthier than mine since it wasn't doused in sauce - but perhaps the cholesterol tradeoff evens that out).  We went at a slow time in the afternoon on a Thursday. The hostess was kind. The waiters were very helpful and friendly. The decor was wonderful. The half eggshells on the walls, insides painted gold, make a nice reflection for the lights that fill the room. Very charming."}
{"text":"We go to vegas all the time. But this was my 1st time at the Fu Asian kitchen and boy are they a great restaurant. Friendly staff very clean environment great lounge music and great and yummy food. Try their dumplings and the Mongolian beef which is out of this world. The servers were very attentive and kind. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Kind of expensive, and so so service.  The lettuce wraps tasted weird and weren't very good, the xo green beans were just okay for $13, and the shrimp tasted flavorless and fishy.  No wonder it was pretty empty."}
{"text":"I usually expect Chinese food to be family style: big dishes, shared. Fu is definitely single serving, which is perfect because I ended up in Vegas alone. I was looking for a vegetarian place and Fu popped up.  The menus is ok. A lot of Americanized stuff, as well as some Thai dishes for some reason(pad thai, really?) I got the vegan chicken kung pao and was pleasantly  surprised. It came with rice and was well seasoned. I never like regular kung pao but I finished the whole thing.  Special commendations should be made for my waiter, Thomas. He offered hot sauce before I asked, brought out water and chopsticks for my meal, and even apologized when I ordered a drink with cherries, which I am allergic to, even though it was my fault that I didn't read the menu. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food ;-), I will be visiting again when I come to Las Vegas again.    Would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Wish I took a photo. Pot stickers were awesome. The magic mike inspired tacos with kalbi and kimchi was the BEST!! Could have eaten another order, maybe two!"}
{"text":"Checked into the Hard Rock and received a $20.00 off coupon for Fu.  Decided to give it a try.   The result?  We found an enjoyable new place that hit the spot although it didn't hit every spot.  Fu is Asian Fusion.  The staff was friendly although they did forget to apply the coupon and had to redo the bill.  (They did however give me my change which made me very happy and earned a bigger tip.)  First the tasty.  The Shrimp Dumplings were excellent with a delicate sauce giving them a burst of flavor.  The ribs were in a tasty plum sauce but alas it was over the top in sweetness.  I had to take some chili paste to tone it down.  Go figure.  Still the ribs tasted good once the sweetness died down.  For entrees we had the pan fried noodles with shrimp, scallops, chicken and mushrooms.  This was my favorite dish although my plus one did not like the noodles as much as I.  The dish was well prepared.  Our waitress recommended the steak tenderloins which we tried. The sauce was the star as the tenderloin strips were cooked perfectly but without the sauce, lacked the flavor you get from a steak establishment.  The sauce however was divine and I could have licked the bowl.  The drink menu is limited and the deserts are lacking.  Without the coupon this would have cost us $80.00 (2 apps, noodles and 1 entree plus a drink).  A little pricey but not out of line considering we couldn't finish everything.  All in all, Fu has the potential to be a hit but needs more consistency."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here last night. The service was amazing they went above and beyond to please us. They we're so nice. The food was even better. Best Chinese food I have had in vegas by far. Fu you are my new favorite hidden gem!"}
{"text":"By far the best Asian food I have ever been to. So delicious, all entrees are freshly made. I love that they mixed things up at night and have a different set of menu. Yum. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"It was completely dead in here the day we came in for an early dinner. Like, we were literally the only people in the restaurant.  Service was excellent. Of course, how could it not be with no one else to wait on?  The food was good. It seemed like standard fare Chinese food. Prices weren't that extravagant either."}
{"text":"Very good spot for a quick lunch. Food portions are def on the family style size and they pack great flavor.  The price point is very good specially because you'll end up with left overs for sure! Get some Fu for the after party!  Ambiance is pretty nice. Fresh and a little more than just casual.   Location was kinda far from my tower (closer to the HRH tower) and was a little hidden.  One of the things I appreciated the most was how attentive our server Paul was. He was knowledgable, friendly and courteous. This guy made the experience go from average to pretty cool."}
{"text":"Last on my agenda for Restaurant Week was Fu at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Lovely to look at outside the red footbridge that leads inside, I also found this restaurant to serve colorful and very tasty Cantonese food in a relaxed setting.  Diane and I were seated on a comfortable banquette and a Chinese-themed chair behind a black lacquered table.  This was our best bargain of RW, because for $30.13 the first course for each person included an Asian Tapas Sampler that consisted of a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potsticker, and a Spicy Wonton; the second course a choice of Wok Seared Salmon with Ginger Basil Sauce, Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli; and the third course a Dessert Trio of Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and Lychee Mochi Ice Cream.  None of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separately.  The potsticker was excellent with Ginger Sauce.  I didn't find the wonton to be spicy at all.  And, I quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling.  Since I was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out, plus present a more comprehensive review, I also ordered a bowl of Spicy Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, which was nicely hot and spicy as billed, with morsels of chicken, bamboo shoots, Wood Ear Mushrooms, Green Onions, and Black and Glass Noodles--a fairly mild but still spicy, good-sized serving for one diner.  Lucky for me, Diane had a Hard Rock Hotel BOGO coupon for Fu from the night before when we had become introduced to Culinary Dropout, so besides two entrees of Honey Walnut Shrimp, we were also presented with our ordered choice of Kung Pao Chicken.  Diane got her Walnut Shrimp devegetablized but I enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps.  The Lemon Aioli on this dish was subtle, the shrimps were succulent, and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds.  This entree was quite large in size.  Indeed, there is no noticeable portion control in operation here.  The Kung Pao Chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two (even though I ate two entrees by myself).  But I'm a big boy with a big appetite!  LOL!  This was dead-ahead Cantonese Kung Pao Chicken just mildly spicy with slices of Red and Green Bell Pepper, mostly whole peanuts, and no visible Chili Peppers.  The spice emanated from the Brown Sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed.  No filler like celery was present, and no fat clung to the top-tier chicken.  In the assemblage of desserts, the tapioca tasted lemony, and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla.  The Chocolate Ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top, and cake underneath, was fabulous.  Even the smooth and hot Jasmine Mist Organic Tea was great!  And, refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner.  The meal lasted long because I was barely able to finish all of the fine Cantonese food laid out before me.  But eventually I did!  Thumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance.  And, service was friendly and excellent, and so accommodating that when I asked for Sweet & Low, although I found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant (Splenda and Equal are), a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from Room Service, and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packets.  This was a great way for us to bid goodbye to Restaurant Week just before we left for California.  And, we will surely be back for more of the wonderful Cantonese food so graciously served at Fu."}
{"text":"Sweetest staff ever!! Always so kind and welcoming. I work up stairs and get a chance to see them every day. Fried rice is always a great choice and the atmosphere is a great dine in option."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Had high expectations but left unsettled.  We waited much too long for less than half the tables full.  We made a special request to fried rice but chef did not deliver.  Sizzling beef looked amazing and black pepper sauce and mushrooms were awesome but the beef cubes were tough not tender.  Unfortunate."}
{"text":"What a gem inside the Hard Rock Casino!  Food: 5 stars (Must try the ribs, miso sea bass, Mongolian beef tenderloin, and Thai basil salmon!   Everything is cooked to perfection. I love how the sauces are so unique and rich - I always make time to eat here every time I visit Vegas!)  Service: 5 stars (My party is always well taken care of...A little smile goes a long way. :))  Ambiance: 5 stars (LOVE the decor! Modern chic and super cool.)  Can't wait to go back! Mm mmm! :P"}
