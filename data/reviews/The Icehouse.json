{"text":"The drinks are about $7 a pop. It's $3 an hour for parking. Most of the very limited menu was sold out.  Popcorn is free...  The Icehouse is meant to have a concession stand feel. The prices and me he selections rival the Kohl Center in prices -but does of course serve alcohol."}
{"text":"The Edgewater has done a lovely job of creating a glorified concession stand with very junior staff who aren't sure what beers are on tap, hilarious bar prices and poor ventilation. You'll leave with a lighter wallet, fry oil scented clothes and a dull pain from allowing yourself to get swindled by a boy scout."}
{"text":"Wanted to ice skating on a beautiful snowy Saturday. Was SO EXCITED. Called and asked what time they were open until, they told me 9, drove in a blizzard to go ice skating, arrived at 540 to be told they were closing at 6 for a private event. No offer to make up for the miscommunication. Disappointed and won't be returning - will find somewhere else in Madison to ice skate."}
