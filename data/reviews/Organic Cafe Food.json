{"text":"Walking around downtown all the coffee shops were closed, however we stumbled upon this one. The staff/service was very friendly, and the drinks were delicious and fairly priced! My friend & I even received treats on the house because it was so cold! Would recommend, and definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally have a place to get food again by my place of work, however, I need to go back to looking because this continues to disappoint even after giving them more than several chances.  First off, they are rarely open before 730 am when they should be up and ready to go with coffee at 630 (when they say they open).  Second the food is terrible. Nothing makes them stand out from the egg and cheese english muffin that I can make at home.  They recently added more items to their lunch menu (hence the next chance) but alas, their chicken tastes like rubber.  It was clearly under-cooked (hope I am not poisoned) and very sub-grade (if it even was chicken).  I couldn't even finish more than one bite without sending it spiraling into the trash."}
{"text":"Three stars are for the very tasty fish (basa) and rice from the Persian side of the menu. It was good. Good-sized portion. Friendly service.

But there is so, so much that this cafe needs to work in or it'll be closed by the end of April.

First, the name. It makes no sense. Yes they serve Paradise Mountain \"organic\" coffee. Every coffee that's not Vietnamese robusta that costs 35 cents a pound and is used to make instant coffee is \"organic.\" That doesn't give you the right to name your cafe \"Organic Cafe Food\" when nothing else on the entire menu is certified organic. You can't just throw that term around unless you're going to back it up with a statement on sourcing. 

Further to the name: This used to be a Viet sub joint called \"Cafe Sub.\" The new owners replaced \"sub\" with... that's right, \"food.\" I just- no words. You have one opportunity to name your restaurant and you choose that name. It's brave, I guess.

Second, the coffee. It's made on a Breville. A home espresso machine, and not a high-end one. But they market the place as if it is a high-end coffeehouse. It's not. It's not even as good as the espresso setup in my kitchen. And Paradise Mountain is, to my taste, horrible, way too dark, and not the sort of bean that a place trying to market itself as a coffeehouse would serve.

Third, the menu. It's WAY too big with no obvious theme. It's like a mom and pop hole in the wall on the Plus 15. 

I suggested to the owner that they focus on Persian food and I hope the that they listen, but I really doubt this place will be around for long."}
