{"text":"Inside Carnegie Museum, down, down, down in the basement is a casual cafe called Fossil Fuels (adorable.) What I like most about this place is that they know their clientele. People with kids! That said, be prepared that the ambiance is very \"basement cafeteria\". If you want fancy-schmancy, visit the upscale cafe upstairs. They had many healthy and quick options for adults and kids alike. Salads, wraps, slice of pizza, cup of soup. Soft drinks, coffee, juice and the like as well. There are also vending machines available if you need something even faster! My two favorite options: a cup of goldfish crackers for around $1.50 and a hard boiled egg for a buck. I usually am a \"brown-bag\" girl on museum days, but I wouldn't hesitate to head to Fossil Fuels for a quick snack or lunch when I leave my lunch at home."}
{"text":"Really cute option in the museum! I had a garden salad that was overloaded with veggies and hubs had a pizza slice. Reasonably priced and clean.  Great for families!"}
