{"text":"Nice big juicy burger. You pick your toppings which I like. Went with traditional goods for first time.  I knocked a star off because of bun. It was fresh but the quality should stand up to the same quality of the patty. It would be a real game changer for this place.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Never have I been to a place in Calgary that's had this much hype surrounding it, But, in the case of Flipping Burgers, much of it is well, well deserved!   To begin, imagine my joy to find out that this place has Halal offerings! (Goodbye Fish Filets, I'll see you later Veggie burgers.) Next, let it be known that the food is actually pretty great; I'm sure the creativity of their in-house made creations make for some killer burgers [I can only speak for the Beef and Chicken burgers (5 stars) and fries (3 stars - relatively dry at the time and lacking seasoning) but I've seen some other interesting plates come out the kitchen]. Combine all that with friendly, passionate service and you'll soon agree that Flipp'n Burgers is a classic. Me and my spouse make it a must to stop by whenever we're in Kensington.   Oh, and they got those ol' school glass pop bottles all cold and refreshing just waiting for you. Doesn't get much more classic than that!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service is hit and miss. Mostly hit. Nice and quick though it can get busy."}
{"text":"I'll start with the worst -- when they first opened I got a plastic pull tab (eg like from a yogurt container) that fell into a tub of sauce in my burger. First burger I had. Plus the wait was forever. Sounds bad? Yup. But then... I went back and told them. Told them how much I liked the burger, and told them abut the plastic tab (this happens a lot in kitchens, or so I've been told by friends who have worked kitchens) and the stupid wait time. They thanked me for the candor, and fixed it. Now, that is how businesses should operate. They've become a fixture in the community already! They take the feedback and change. I love that! I just had a double cheese burger with dijon, hot sauce, onion, frizzled onion, pickle, and banana peppers. It was amazing. the patties are steak trim. They also do veggie burgers AND vegan patties! Also, they make their own Kufta/Kofta,  shaped like hot dogs and served in a hot dog bun. They also have all-beef hot dogs. And Caesar salad. And shakes. Gahhh, the mind drools. Topping options? How about hummus, or horseradish, or pesto or various aioli? Man, hillhurst/sunnyside has NEEDED a burger joint for a lonnnng time (only burgers you can get are in bars. Different atmosphere, is all). These guys nailed it -- and it all started with a chunk of plastic in my first burger..."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Had a cheeseburger and onion rings. Rings were overcooked and the bun was kinda dry. Thr beef patty was nothing special. Wouldn't bother with thos place again."}
{"text":"Worst burgers!! Worst fries!!  There is a weird ramp u gotta walk on to get onto the place that was not set right and I almost broke my foot on it.  The guy behind the counter was rude and unimpressed with his job. When we asked for a second  gravy he scoffed about it. And the chicken tenders  were burnt.  Nope never going back."}
{"text":"I went to this place a while ago and have never been back. So this review should be taken with a grain of salt the place may have improved since; but when I went,  Pro: Closest take out type \"gourmet\" burger place to downtown. - Price seems on par with other places like it.  Cons: - The girl who was working (1 girl, 1 guy) was just plain rude. Rolling her eyes when I remind her about a missing order of fries.. Standing there like we are an inconvenience while we are ordering. - The sweet potato fries were inedible, absolutely disgusting (and I rarely say that about any food) they were like hunks of mushy sweet potato that had been floating in cold grease. They were promptly thrown away. - Burger was ok, I remember thinking it had a strange taste, but not horrible like the fries.  I could walk to this place from my house in 10 minutes and I have been here once with no plans to return.."}
{"text":"Tasty, straight forward burgers in a fun tiny spot.  However I'd skip the beef bacon."}
{"text":"I liked the variety of toppings/ buns/ burgers  offered here. It's nice to see they have more than one vegetarian option. I also like how they break down what ingredients are in the veggie burgers. I chose the vegan burger an my bfriend the double cheeseburger, along with yam fries.  The staff were super friendly and chatty, so they would get 5 stars for service alone.  When the burgers came out, they kindly separated our yam fries on to each plate. The fries were kind of floppy, not crispy like I'm used to having them. They come with skin on, which makes me think they are healthier than they probably are. Didn't think the portion size was worth the $4.  My vegan burger was decent. Didn't have too much flavour, but it was my fault for not asking for enough sauce. The bun was nice and fresh and the sautéed mushrooms tasty, but I would have liked a few more on there seeing as its a topping you pay extra for. My bf enjoyed his burger. He also felt though that it was a tiny bit over priced for the portion size. I definitely would go back to Flippin' when I'm in the area again, and craving a  burger, simply for the fact that they use hormone free meat. I'm liking how this is starting to become a more popular choice for calgary burger joints, so thanks to these guys for jumping on board."}
{"text":"Came to this place as my bf and I were in search for a good burger joint and saw the reviews on Yelp. This place is pretty close to our home and its great! Service was awesome and food was really good. We told the guy it was our first time there and he took the time to give us a rundown of how to order. They have so many burger choices. You pick your burger, pick your toppings (so many of them) and pick your sauce. We ordered 2 burgers, a vanila milkshek (old fashioned and delicious btw), glass bottle of coke and small fries for $40. Was fairly decently priced for the amount of food that you get.   The thing we love about this place is that they use fresh ingredients. No frozen stuff. They make and cook the patties as soon as you order. The patties are made from local meat (Aspen farm) so they are supporting a local company and the buns are fresh (you can taste the freshness and softness of the bread. They offer vegan as well as gluten free. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service despite the late hour we arrived.  Generous sized portions.   Great food, great taste.  Excellent fries! Go try !"}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger and onion rings. The burger was a generic burger with little taste and the onion rings had to have a bucket of salt on them. The only  reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the quick delivery, won't be eating there again and recommend no one else does either!"}
{"text":"A great option for a group of people with lots of different dietary needs. The carnivore, vegetarian and vegan will all be very satisfied.   I had the vegan burger on a gluten free bun, which, I was told, dont come frozen but  are made fresh from local bakery daily. Really really good.   Overall: great burgers, friendly service, and fun decor. Will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Kensington, possibly in Calgary. Lots of options including veggie and halal. On the cons, it is quite expensive ($9.25 for a cheeseburger), and service can be very slow."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was delicious, yam fries were okay, and strawberry milkshake was really not worth the $6.50 I paid for it."}
{"text":"It was good. Everything tasted fresh and the char broil flavor is nice. Fries are awesome. The burger could have been cooked a little longer as it was a bit more medium than well done. Maybe you have to ask like in the USA? Overall good."}
{"text":"Below average burgers. The fries were soggy yet tasted burnt. Won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Went to this burger place recently and was not very impressed with it, I was asked for my name and said it'll be called when it's done, it's a very loud, smoky, greasy little shop, there is no where to stand, thankfully one table became available so I sat down and waited for my name to be called, after 15 min the 3 ppl order After me got their orders and I went up and ask, she looked around for my order and couldn't seem to find it, finally she said it'll be out soon without any apology, then another 10 min, my order came out the prep lady just yelled out what was ordered (burger and fries) without calling my name, I almost missed it, very unorganized.  The guy flips the burger was chatting with his friend not working on the grills, one lady was standing there for a long time, finally the order lady asked if it's ready, and he just said yes, then he took out her chicken burger from the warmer and put some sauce on, so apparently it was done long time ago and he didn't bother to serve it because he's so busy chatting.  The food was ok, nothing special, it's greasier than other burgers, the fries was horrible, extremely greasy and hard, tasted like re-fried day-old fries.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"$10 for a single mushroom/Swiss wasn't good value in my opinion.  Bun was unremarkable and beef was a bit too blackened for my liking.  One of these days a burger joint will open that puts fresh sautéed mushrooms and real Swiss on a high quality bun.  That would be worth $10.  As it stands, I can get a higher quality burger for the same price from national burger chain.    Lower this price point, and improve on quality & this place will do much more business."}
{"text":"We live across the street from Flipp'n burgers and we were itching to try in, but getting in shape for a trip prevented us.  After the trip, we decided to give it a try.  I got the Flipp'n burger and my wife got a cheeseburger with bacon.  We also shared onion rings.  We got  both burgers on whole wheat buns which was a nice option to have.  The Flipp'n burger was HUGE.  It was enough for 2 people definitely.  The ingredients (especially the fried onions) were great.  I believe the beef burger patties were store-bought which was a bit disappointing, but otherwise this burger was good and filling if you want to be filled.  I would give it 4/5.  My wife did not like the taste of the bacon on the cheeseburger as it was beef bacon and not pork.  She was quite disgusted with the discovery of several thick black hairs in the burger.  Once found, she would not eat another bite (understandably so).  Atmosphere is good in there.  It is a little unorganized when there is more than 1 customer in there.  I like the option of bottled pop.  If 3.5/5 was an option I would give it that, but with the discovery of hair in the burger I brought it down to a 3 instead of raising it to the 4.  Otherwise I would have given it 4."}
{"text":"The vegan burger is seriously delicious -- one of the best I've had! And they had a handy little sign listing the ingredients of their vegetarian items, which is very helpful. So many yummy toppings, plus the fries were really good too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Flipp'n is located in what some would call a \"building with character\", but don't let the sketchy exterior dissuade you, this place makes a great burger. They make a really good bacon cheddar burger and I usually get Avocado on it. The avocado they use is always fresh and never brown and mushy like I've seen at other places. A little pricy but definitely worth it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times I had the cheeseburger. They were quite different (but both yummy) because there's tons of different topping options, some included with the price of the burger and a few premium items they charge extra for.  They (awesomely) make the burger patties with meat that's free of hormones and antibiotics. They pretty much let the meat stand on its own -- I would prefer a more seasoned patty personally, but I know many others who would disagree. They are big, sloppy, greasy burgers, in a good way. A single cheeseburger comes in at under $10, and it's a filling lunch by itself.  The place is small, but they have a decent number of seats and the decor is really charming -- classic Coca-Cola diner retro. The service is friendly, you get the feeling the staff is enjoying themselves and that's always nice."}
{"text":"As I think most of you know, I'm a vintage girl, so anywhere that looks like it stepped out of the 1950s will get at least one visit from me. In this regards, the place is great - cutesy, kitschy, and if you sit on one of the window stalls sharing a milkshake, you'll start expecting the gang from Archie comics to wander in. The staff are also great - very attentive to making sure your order is right, and explaining what's included.  For that alone, they should get 4 stars. However, the food is where the problems begin sneaking in.   The vanilla milkshake is pretty good - ridiculously expensive for what it was, but had a decent taste, although it wasn't all that thick. For $5, I expect a LOT of ice cream in my milkshake!   The burger... well, you know when you go get a burger at stampede, or at a really cheap cafe? Yeah, that's what they taste like. It's also kraft singles for the 'cheese'. Now, they do have some pretty impressive included sides (mushrooms and onions, yum!) but $9 for a burger that I can buy for $5 in a cafe somewhere... I'm not very impressed. I want something memorable, not something my tastebuds identify as 'cheap ass fast food'.   The portion of fries was HUGE (too many even when sharing a container between two very hungry people), but too salty for my taste. I love seasoning salt, but the fries shouldn't be turning orange from the amount used.   So, for someone who likes those types of burgers, fries and milkshakes, you'd probably like this place.   For me... guess I'll skip the nostalgia and just head over to Smashburger when I want something at a comparable price but way better quality."}
{"text":"Though delicious, I find the burgers a little expensive for the serving size, I tried the fries to compensate but they weren't good. Either they're going for the rustic baked look for it otherwise the fries tasted just old and soggy. Regular fries won't be a bad option to offer besides the baked ones so we'd know what to expect."}
{"text":"I think this place seats about 15 people. Our group of 5 arrived at 1:30pm and for a while we sat with the friendliest guy who was finishing up, then we stuck his table to another table. It's not quite made for groups. I love that they have three types of veggie burgers, one of them vegan. Most of our team had Angus beef burgers and fries and all the burgers were thick and great-tasting. The fries and caesar salad were good sides. The staff were really nice. Some regulars showed up and everyone glowed with comraderie. It seemed like a nice place.  In other news, they have a falafel burger. And a black bean burger. So I know I will be back at least two more times."}
{"text":"I totally get what the hype is about when it comes to flipp'n burgers! Fresh made burgers, grilled to order with the classic toppings and a few different choices.  We ordered cheeseburgers with an egg on top, fries and a drink. You aren't paying fast food prices here, but you are getting what you pay for. The burgers came out hot, juicy and tasting fresh off the grill. So good!   The fries were a hit as well, fresh out of the fryer with delicious seasoning. The portion was generous and too much for me to eat along with a burger. Fries would be perfect for sharing though.  Loved it and I know where I'm coming the next time I'm craving a burger in kensi."}
{"text":"This review is for their Halal Flippin burger.  The patty and condiments are awesome and worthy of a 5-star rating.  However, the halal burger itself, I suspect is frozen because it doesn't quite taste like fresh beef.  That is what brings this place down to 3-stars for me.  If they can actually offer a quality halal patty, this would be the best halal burger I've had in Canada, which currently rests with Burgernator in Toronto.    Fries were crisp and delicious. Really a stand-out item.  Very, very good fries."}
{"text":"Hit up this place when Urbanspoon listed this as a gluten free option. My friend recently developed celiac allergy and I was hankering for a burger. Not very many burger restaurants offer GF buns, so it was a no brainer. I went for the black bean burger, but when I came to pay I realized my burger was probably not made in house. How'd I know? There were manufacturer's ingredients label for both the vegetarian patties on the side of the glass toppings bar. Somewhat disappointed that my burger came from a vacuum packed plastic and a box. When my burger was ready, I asked for Flippn sauce, sautéed mushrooms and cajun onions; OMG the onions added such a nice smoky flavour. My friend loved her Flippn burger, saying that the patty was cooked well and juicy, but like all GF buns, it didn't taste good. That didn't really take away from the burger, my friend just ate the majority of her burger without the bun. We were amused by the 50s race car diner interior, the mini coke bottle salt and pepper shakers, and the attentive service. I might not be back but I do recommend getting some cajun onions on your burger!"}
{"text":"In my never ending quest for great burgers and fries, I had to find a way to get to Flippn Burgers in Kensington. Having the day off today gave me just such an opportunity.  I had already read numerous reviews on Yelp about this place and knew it was small, so I made sure I went early - 11:30am. The place was almost empty, so no lack of places to sit.  Let's start with the burger. I ordered a cheeseburger on a brown bun with mustard, pickle and sauteed onions, with fries and a bottle of ginger ale. I like that the pop is in glass bottles - a nice touch. I know now what other reviewers meant about the patty itself. It doesn't have that 'I just made this with my own hands' texture. In fact one could mistake this for a frozen patty. But I do believe that the meats used in this place are 'halal' meats, so I doubt this allows for fresh ground beef made into handmade patties. I could be wrong.  That's OK though. The burger was good enough. My biggest concern was the fries. My last sojourn was to Cliveburger and their fries were - how shall we say - shellacked. They were likely cooked at too high a temperature and this created a fry that was too crispy and not tender enough on the inside.  Not at Flippn Burgers. Their fries (IMHO) are perfect. Many thanks to Omar, who is forever trying to get the recipe right. You did it, man."}
{"text":"So, having a girls' night with my best friend - watching movies, having wine and we both decide (as you do after a little vino) that it's time for burgers and fries! On to Skip the Dishes we go to see where we can order from, and there's Flipp'n Burgers. I'd been wanting to try their food for some time, so the opportunity had arrived.   Now I will be honest here. The food was delivered right on time, but still we found that the burgers were still not super. (Beefy bacon - definitely worth writing home about! That was what I enjoyed the most about my burger.)   The star that stole the show for us, however, was a complete shocker: MEXICAN POUTINE, WE ARE NOT WORTHY!! Fries - crisp and hot. Peppers - jalapeño and banana...oh my...and the gravy...wow. A little on the salty side (but that's what we wanted!) and the right amount of gravy to cheese curd ratio. Don't be fooled by the menu on Skip indicating that it's \"Swiss\". Nope. These were the real deal cheese curds.   I may not be raving about your burgers, but that poutine is the stuff of legends. Keep on Flipp'n!"}
{"text":"Great for a reasonably priced burger! Big, juicy and with your choice of awesome toppings. Fries were great, too. Love the retro decor and glass bottle cokes!"}
{"text":"So I went back to this place last night, and as always, their burgers are *awesome* and based on my experience yesterday, now the service is *awesome* as well!  Now this place is my fave burger joint in the city hands down.  Keep up the good work you guys!"}
{"text":"I am spending my money here...  Here's why.  We met a young couple w Down's syndrome at flippin burgers, and they were obviously cherished customers. The owners gave them empty pop bottles to take in (they are saving for an engagement ring), split a burger in half and put on individual toppings for each, and made the sweet girl poutine when she asked (although it isn't on the menu), and told us how special and important that this couple are to them.  So ya.  EAT HERE.  It's a great little business that deserves to be supported.  Ps: we loved our burgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers but they are never consistent with the poutines and milkshakes. I don't know if it's a lack of training of the staff but I was very disappointed in the milkshake I recently brought from there. I could have made a better milkshake in my sleep."}
{"text":"I bet someone woke up one day and thought \"Damn, Sabahat is a really awesome girl. I think we ought to do something equally awesome for her. How about we open up a BURGER joint 2 minutes from her house? She loves burgers! Oh, and lets serve up beef bacon! Cuz she doesnt eat pig bacon. Yeah, this can be our awesome little present to her!\"  Pros:  - AMAZING vegan burger! I'm no vegan, and even I was SO impressed! It was moist, and FULL of flavour! Seriously the best non-meat burger I've ever had. I'd fully go and order that same burger again! - They have beef bacon!! As in, no pork bacon in the house! Whaaat?! Yesssss!! - Super cute vintage glass Coca Cola bottles. I dont really like Coca Cola, but they're cute as hell. - Cute decor and friendly awesome staff.  Cons:  - A little slow, but heck, who cares.  - Its mighty hard to walk by this place without wanting to stop in and get a burger. And we dont want to pig out on burgers everyday, do we? I reserve that for one special week during the year :)  VERDICT:  Flipp'n Burgers! Woohoo! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The best burger in Canada according to my growing 14 year old son. We eat here every few weeks. Amazing staff and service too."}
{"text":"First time in. Reminds me of a place called Secret Pizza in Las Vegas. Retro New York style burger joint, small, intimate, black and white photos on the wall. Good old rock and roll playing. Friendly staff.  Serving glass bottle Coke to complete the time warp. Don't have a liquor license so no beer  :(    Ordered... Now we wait.   The burger: hormone free, no anti biotics. Perfectly charred tower of deliciousness. Had the Flippn burger, a double with two kinds of cheese, beef bacon and fried onions, it was almost as tall as my retro Coke glass. Shared a large fries. Huge. Fresh. Well cooked (and the fryer oil is not weeks old! The fries were awesome. Bonus!)  After dislocating my jaw to get my face around this bad boy, my taste buds ascended to heaven. Wow. Only two complains. My mouth, and the napkins, were not big enough. Finished the burger. Six napkins down.   Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. PFG - pretty f***** good. Definitely come check it out. Worth every penny.  Love it!"}
{"text":"#134  I headed in after 18 April 2015's Yelp! Event at the Container Bar/Vine Styles just before 1700. I had seen many snippets of reviews, overheard conversations, etc. but I wish I could say what my newest friend, Kate B., said in her review in that she got \"what the hype is about when it comes to Flipp'n burgers!\"  Sadly, I do not get it. I was born blonde but I do not think that's it.  Most of you who know me know I eat a lot, I eat around, and am reasonably fair when it comes to reviews and descriptions and even if you do not know me, you are probably smart enough to figure out.  Let's start with the order:  1 Flipp'n burger $14 1 order onion rings $5 1 creamsicle shake $6.25 1 Yelp! discount and adding an egg to the burger -$2  So, that's $27+ with tax before the tip.  So, with this order in process and waiting at a small table, I proceeded to read other reviews and tips noticing that my friend Wanda B. said this about her side order that she discovered \"they are McCain's Sweet Potato French Fries. What happened to the home made version? Seriously I can buy my own McCain's frozen french fries in the stores.\" After reading that, my happiness began to fade and when I got my onion rings, they seemed overcooked and rather small (a large quantity for sure) but I can tell you that the onion ring type dishes at Smashburger or even A&W are way better. Do not get these; you will be sorry. I don't know if these are McCain's or whatever but I do know, these were not acceptable for the kind of press this joint has.  By the way, during the order process, I did see an order of french fries which did look good so, when I do go back, I'll probably just stick with those.  The shake was delicious! The problem here was the lack of quantity (too little shake for too much moolah).  Now, for the apparently 2014 award winning burger on a multigrain bun, I noticed the following:  the toppings were amply applied and fresh (you get to pick those and I hope the picture I uploaded of that bar did post because that was awesome). the burgers (meat) were huge (two of them) I should have removed the mushrooms since I normally don't like those on burgers and I think that made it taste salty (on the whole, the burger was too salty, probably because of this). the sandwich was huge!  To be honest, I've had better burger meat at Smashburger and Clive Burger (though recently, Clive Burger appears to have dropped the ball).  For this amount of money, I expected higher quality (except as already noted) and quantity (again, as already noted).  I will go at least one more time because I realize people have off days; hell, maybe my day was off but my trip to Nellie's in Kensington around noon was really good (that review is coming by the way).  The decor here is totally awesome with pictures of golden era of New York and San Francisco and the many Elvis pictures. Feels like an old diner but be warned, it can get claustrophoic.  The customer service is about you'd expect for Canada/Canadians, Californians, nothing to write home about (it should be better but it could have been worse). But again, I will give it one more chance at a to be determined data (after my stomach recovers)."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I did. Cool little corner nook in Kensington with great ambiance. Calgary needs more places like this BUT I wasn't blow away by the food. My meat was under cooked and none of the flavours blew my mind. $30 for two burgers and a large fries, I expected more flavour. Overall not bad and with the positive other reviews I would definitely give it a second chance!"}
{"text":"I don't often opt for a burger when dining out, mainly because gluten-free buns aren't always reliable in the taste department, and I generally make them at home. I did happen to read all the great reviews of Flipp'n, and decided to check things out.   Man oh man! This was an amazing burger. Simple, yet extremely tasty (and the GF bun was a home run). Service is very made-to-order, and seating is limited, but I found that I didn't mind watching other customers prep their burgers while I waited for mine, and the taste was totally worth the wait.   I didn't even mention the fries yet - the seasoning on the fries is perfect. They are cooked to a nice crispy finish, and are a perfect compliment to the burgers."}
{"text":"Really inconsistent with the food. Wish the staff had better training. When they run out of actual chicken fingers they run to safe way and get the super cheap one that are for kids and charge the same price. The renovation is useless if the service and food is the same."}
{"text":"Super yummy juicy halal burgers joint. i recommend this place to anyone. Also they have nice onion rings. Didn't like fries much but over all best experience in Calgary."}
{"text":"Noone can find a better, tasty burger anywhere on calgary or province wide or even Canadian wide ... Than what these guys have! They make it with passion .. Lots of passion and a big smile on the face."}
{"text":"Meat - combine it with fire and you've got a flavour formula that's been around for hundreds of years!  Flipp'n Burgers knows this combination, and they know it well.    The Food - The burgers are wonderfully juicy with that locked-in flavour that only fire can provide.  Lots of toppin's and fixin's fer yer choosin', so you can build up your Flipp'n burger however you like.  The Place - It's a great quick stop if you're on the go in Kensington, but to get the full effect, stay a while.  Flipp'n's got a nice throwback 50's inspired burger joint feel with classic celebrity photos, two-person booths, and a few modern touches.  Grab yourself a glass bottle of Coca-Cola and savour it.  Could just be my inability to read signs, but I found their menu billboard a little confusing.  I've found myself looking up in the air, totally lost, saying something like \"Umm..I'll...get the burger?\"   But for an independent burger joint like this, I just chalk that up to \"Character!\"  As a result, however, I'm not too familiar with any other items they offer.  I'll take a longer look at the menu next time, as I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a tasty, juicy, Halal Burger then this place has it. Went in with my family for the first time and it was absolutely delicious and not to mention such a friendly staff. I prefer the Onion rings over the Fries and their Chocolate Shake is to die for! yumm.. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! I ordered their special and it was great. The fries aren't that good though. I totally recommend them."}
{"text":"Good burger, nothing to write home about though. I'd rather try a few different places before coming back but certainly if you are in the area and feel like a burger then you can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"It's honestly not bad food but very over priced. And for vegans ordering a vegan burger -  it's very disappointing. The vegan patty on its own tasted great but was as thin as a coin, so the entire burger just tasted like bun. If they would make this patty thick, then I would give a better rating."}
{"text":"After listening to John Gilchrist's review of Flipp'n Burger I decided to add another YYCBurger Week burger to my list. Realizing that it would be super busy at lunch time after a great review I opted to go at 12:45. I found parking easily on 10 St. The place was full but there was actually a table free when my friend I got there. Sadly that was the best part of the visit, that we got a table right away. The YYCBurger was supposed to be a 6oz burger, melted smoked gouda, sautéed mushrooms and peppers, frizzled onions, and baby spinach on a fresh white Kaiser with melted garlic butter, topped with Provencal mustard an egg and a smoke sauce. The egg was over cooked and the onions were soggy and the burger obviously a pre-made patty. It's a step up from a chain-store burger but not the delectable juicy burger that I would need at least 5 napkins for because of the runny egg-yolk and the rest of the toppings. I needed the 5 napkins because it was very greasy, couldn't really tell there was a smoke sauce on it or garlic butter. I'd give this a miss."}
{"text":"This is a really great burger place!   The interior has a very retro feel to it--black and white photos on the wall are very nostalgic and there is a cute retro fridge where the drinks(lemonade, bottled water, Coca Cola) are kept.     Hubby and I shared a bacon cheese burger with yam fries.  Yum!  Big and juicy, that's how we like it!   Our son had the double cheeseburger.   The servers and chef were very friendly and attentive.  They informed us halfway through our meal that their freezer came back online(they had trouble restarting it after the power went out due to the flood), so we ordered Creamsicle and chocolate milkshakes.           I think I can get used to beef bacon.  They even gave us an extra side of fries with their special Flipp'n burger sauce.   Delicious and zingy!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered my burger with cheese and \"beefy bacon\",I stayed away from the frys as I saw a previous customer order them and they looked like flip. The grill/kitchen looked disgusting, and this one kid was running the place..Then when it was time to put toppings on, the toppings looked gross (no covers), The owner eventually showed up, and started cleaning tables with disposable napkins(ridiculous), and then came to top my burger, it was just a mish-mash of horrible flavours placed all over. IT GOES MAYO ON TOP SIDE WITH VEGGIES, THEN SAUCES ON BOTTOM YOU DUMBFLIPPS. well the burger was a huge dissapointment - premade frozen bulk burgers from a factory, the tiniest tomatoes and cheapest lettuce you can imaging, all this for 16$, total flippn ripoff. Stay away, i'll never be coming back, flip off..."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers in this city! The choices are rather spread out! Service is rather hit or miss. Pricing is great as well."}
{"text":"Service was good, the counter person was polite and easy going.  The hamburger met my son's craving for a hamburger; I had the black bean burger and it was nice.  The chicken burger was actually 2 chicken fingers - guess it worked.  Not a burger to write home about, but was still good."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Poor service. Rude management/owner. Watched someone who appeared to be either the manager or the owner basically berate a little old lady for not speaking loud enough to the cashier when placing her order, though I could hear her just fine standing 5ft away and the cashier didn't seem to have any trouble neither; dude was just 'flippin' out. I could go on but it's not worth it. This place is lame. Burger was just ok (the toppings were all piled on top of the patty - nothing underneath leaving the bottom bun completely dry, give me a break) for a 12$ burger I expect more; I expect more out of a $8 burger. NEXT!"}
{"text":"I think it may be slightly pricey but it's super good ..... And the beef bacon on the burgers made my day!"}
{"text":"There are a number of quality burger joints in town. Flipp'n Burgers is joining in on the fun, guns blazing. I'm not a regular at burger joints so I'm not going to compare with the others. But if you want a great juicy flavorful burger with all the toppings, I fully recommend Flipp'n.  It's a very small and clean space on 10th street in Kensington. The small space adds intimacy and character, but means as this place gains popularity, you might have to take your sandwich to go. The kitchen and counter are basically all in one. You could actually shout your order from one of three booths or two tables. Max 10-12 seating capacity I'd say.  What I look for from a burger joint is: quality buns: check - you can choose between several types quality patties, size large: check - well, they aren't gigantic, but if need more, get two! quality toppings: there are so many toppings, you could make a plain bun amazing drippin' juicy ensemble: check friendly interesting owner who likes being there: check  And the price? Not cheap, but not outrageous. $7-$9 for a burger, depending on the type. It's worth it.  I'm quite happy with this addition to one of my favourite Calgary neighbourhoods."}
{"text":"Great burgers and delicious fries but Online orders seem to take precedence. The staff seemed overwhelmed but it was Valentine's Day so maybe that's why!!"}
{"text":"12 dollar hockey puck with skate blade bacon. Destroyed my insides later that night. Ate at 4 places while there. 2 were terrible. 2 were good (Grumans and Uno Pizza)."}
{"text":"While this place is normally great don't order from here with Skip the Dishes. Driver sat at restaurant for 20 minutes because they were delayed making the food and it took over an hour when I was quoted 30 min. Also not only was everything ice cold but they didn't include any of the additional dipping sauces ordered, no cheese on the burger and milkshake was a warm chocolate soup with curdled whip cream."}
{"text":"Just as good as the first time."}
{"text":"Great burger, had a double cheese burger and it was amazing. I will certainly be going back the next time I'm in Calgary"}
{"text":"I've been here before, but I had never tried their Flipp'n burger, and it was time (first anniversary since they opened). There was SO MUCH juicy goodness dripping from it that the mess would've run down my arms if I wasn't careful. Wasn't sure I could finish it, either, but I managed to, with a huge pile of toppings, a side of yam fries, and a shake (chocolate). You can pay a lot more for a fancy burger in an upscale restaurant, but I'm not sure it would taste better than this Flipp'n masterpiece."}
{"text":"My fiance & I stopped by last Saturday and had a great experience. I had the Flippn' Burger which nearly blew my mind! A decent sized burger, it was saucy, meaty & messy - just the way I like it. Linds had the black bean burger and claimed it was one of the better veggie burgers she has had. The milkshake & yam fries were the icing on the cake. If you haven't tried here yet, it's one of the best burger joints in the city."}
{"text":"They need to flip faster as 20 min is a little long to wait for a burger. Had the double cheese on my way from downtown to my night class. Not bad but felt fairly processed - like a patty from M&Ms meat shop. No one clearing tables, three people staring at order slips and no one seems to be in a big hurry."}
{"text":"This is the BEST vegan burger I've ever eaten.  Even better than what I make at home.  The perfect combination of flavour, juicy-ness and texture.  I enjoy it most with pickles, tomato, saute'd onions and mushrooms, lettuce, mustard.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"First time been to this burger place. Not disappointed. It is juicy and delicious. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Have not even got my order yet but I'm super impressed with the atmosphere and the staff is great. Can't wait to bite in."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, just for their chocolate milkshakes.  A notch down from Boogie's Burgers and a bit watery compared to Peter's Drive In.  Comes with whipped cream, nice touch.  Will have to return to try their burgers one day.  Nice diner-like feel, with a more modern style to it.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with this place. The staff are always super friendly, their late night hours are really convenient and, most importantly, they serve one of the best burgers in town. Even though I'm totally incapable of ever finishing one, I can't help but order the Flippin Burger every time; it is sooo tasty I prefer to distend my stomach than let one scrumptious bite go to waste. Nothing special about the sides, I've had the fries and the onion rings and both were pretty meh but honestly I think filling up on anything but the burgers is a waste of tummy space anyways!"}
{"text":"I've been back since my very first visit and sadly have to drop my rating. During my first visit the sweet potato french fries were home made and delicious.  This time I ordered the fries only to discover they are McCain's Sweet Potato French Fries. What happened to the home made version? Seriously I can buy my own McCain's frozen french fries in the stores.  Burgers are still super delicious here and they will keep me coming back. But I won't be ordering the fries again."}
{"text":"I will start by saying, I love the Kensington area of Calgary.  I was on my way to Hot Wax Records and figured I would stop for a burger.  Well I knew i was going to love it as soon as I stepped in.  The small, hole in the wall places with random pics and decor on the walls always do it for me as far as ambiance go.  Relaxing and random...Love it!  So I told the guy it was my first time there, what does he recommend?  Well before he even finished telling me, he had a Flipp'n burger on the grill for me.  Big beef paddy, cheddar, swiss, bacon, fried onions and flipp'n sauce (hold the mushrooms).  Got some sweet potato fries and a coke.  He finished the order and I dug in.  GREAT tasting burger.. nicely seasoned beef, nice bun (a good bun makes the burger!)  and the toppings, although messy, were great.  I had a few fries too but that burger was filling!    Left a little over full, but that's my fault for being a burger glutton.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good full huge messy burgers that you devour quickly, fries arent all that. Also bestt part is they have the halal option. I would def go back there again for a burger craving"}
{"text":"Must have been the first customers at 1130 on a Sunday. Dude was on his phone but attentive when needed to be_ very relaxed vibe. Got bacon cheesy burger with large fries and ginger ale in glass btl- bacon wasnt the best. Overall good but the bacon was disappointment. Fries not the best but last night I ate the best fries at side street sooo maybe not fair. I was so hungover this was yummy meal"}
{"text":"Seeking some Retro cool in Kensington- yeah, go here!  I love the burgers here. I have been twice. Once for the mushroom Swiss and another time for the burger with flipp'n sauce, sauteed onions and mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and pickle. I can't wait to try the veggie items like falafel or black bean burger. There's a lot of toppings and sauces to choose from to customize your meal. It's good to have so many options!   My hubby ordered the flipp'n burger which had 2 parties, 2 kinds of cheese, bacon, mushrooms, oh my!!! Our son had a cheeseburger. Sooo tasty and we shared a large order of fries.   There's not much seating indoors but the service is friendly. We sat on the picnic tables in the back outside in the parking lot. Great place to grab take-out and I always leave with a full tummy and a smile!"}
{"text":"After a good lifting session, not only was I craving a burger, I felt like I deserved a burger.  A couple guys suggested Flipp'n Burger.  Without question, I headed straight over with my gym gear on.  Flipp'n burger is located in the heart of Kensington - it was a Thursday night around 7:30PM and parking could easily be found on the streets.  I quickly glanced at the menu board and decided to go with the signature flippin' n burger to go.  I sat and waited so I was able to browse the interior a bit.  It seemed a little retro looking and small with a few tables at the front and seating near the window.  There was also seating outside but it was too cold for that.  I noticed there was a lot of glass bottle sodas and a freezer full of popsicles near the counter where you pay.   After a few minutes, I was called to choose my toppings and that's when I noticed that the burger I had ordered came with two beef patties! Haha, I guess that's what happens when you quickly glance and order.  Any who, there are the general toppings you can choose from as well as a handful of sauces.  I got everything but the jalapenos and olives.  My burger came with cheddar & swiss cheese, 'crispy' onions, sautéed mushrooms, beef bacon and flipp'n sauce....Boy, my burger was flipp'n huge!    When I got home, I couldn't wait to dig into my flipp'n burger.  When I took it out of the paper bag, it kind of fell apart, which was sad because it wasn't wrapped properly but I did not fear as I knew it was all going to the same place, my belly :)  I ate with a fork and knife and I found the bun to be too bready and a waste of calories.  The pattie itself was seasoned well and juicy but slightly on the dry side, and my onions weren't crispy (must have been the drive home) but the beef bacon was delicious!! I found the combination of the burger to be pretty good but it wasn't flippin' amazing.  Maybe next time I'll dine in and have my burger fresh!"}
{"text":"After a day of crummy weather, with the SO spending far too much time in rush hour traffic while heading down for a visit, going out for dinner lost its appeal when 6:30 rolled around and all we wanted to do was crash and watch Netflix. Enter my quest on just-eat.ca to find something for us that was vegan and would deliver to my neighbourhood!  I had heard about Flipp'n Burgers and we decided to order a couple vegan burgers and sweet potato fries! I was very impressed by the amount of toppings available. Our delivery arrived right on schedule despite the weather (thank you delivery driver for being rad and existing).   Upon opening up our take out containers, we felt a little confused initially (as were the kitchen staff apparently) because our toppings were a little mismatched from what we ordered. Luckily, both were still completely vegan so I was happy to eat it either way. I had to throw out the generic \"aoli\" every restaurant seems to give out even when I specify it's no use to me, but the yam fries were fine.   Was very impressed by the vegan burger itself and the quick delivery, as well as the cute bottles our sodas came in. Would like to stop in and check out the decor and stuff in the future, though I'm rarely in the Kensington area around dinnertime! Will order again :)"}
{"text":"Dig the burgers, dig the decor, dig the super friendly staff. The burgers are big and juicy cooked to order  and not greasy and small like some competitors in the city. Endless topping choices, glass bottle sodas, gluten free options. Liked everything about it and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I hate going to new places. I hate explaining celiac's disease because I feel high maintenance and awkward. Right away the staff made me feel comfortable and took my questions seriously. Terrific gluten free buns and the burger was delicious. The (owner I believe) was lovely and even cleaned the grill prior to my burger. There is always a risk as a celiac but they seem to take it super serious. And they didn't bat an eyelash or treat me like I'm difficult.  Bonus: they are Halal and can do vegan. As someone allergic to pork they also do beef bacon. I wish I noticed sooner so I could try it.   Always nice to see staff cleaning tables and such. Most burger joints are so greasy but this one looks like they take pride in what they do.   Great decor. Fantastic retro feel."}
{"text":"Pretty good, very close to a 4 star but the burger could've been a bit juicer and flavorful.  Staff was great, recommended various burger types and how they set you up (you direct them to put your add-on's after the burger is cooked (lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, pickled onions, etc. and the sauces).  Didn't take too long to come out (got the bacon burger and the flippin burger), and as stated in general it was a good burger but did not 'wow' me.  The shakes were sort of the same, pretty darn good but not out of this world.  If I were in the area and hungry I would definitely stop back in, and would recommend the same to anyone else.  There are other burger joints in Calgary which I intend to try before I go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers & fries. Genuinely friendly staff. I've eaten here about 8 times and it was great every time."}
{"text":"Every time Ive walked by this place I have been intrigued to try it out. It has a really cool retro vibe that really draws me in.  So my husband and I finally decided to give it a go. Went later in the night and there was a fair bit of a line up but it went fast. The overall feeling of the place is super cool and makes you wanna go in and order a milkshake for two. Lots interesting old photos on the wall to look at while waiting. I was also immediately impressed by the bottle pop. Just can't beat it. We both decided to order burgers and share an order of onion rings. I went with the single cheese burger with bacon and he went with the fippin burger. There were lots of great topping choices to add to the burger and I was getting really excited about how good it was gonna be. When I got my burger it was HUGE!!! I couldn't believe it was the single burger. We quickly rushed home to eat and I couldn't wait to try it out. However upon my first bite I was somewhat disappointed. Nothing mind blowing about it but I kept eating. The bacon on the burger was kinda tough and chewy. Reading some of the other reviews I see that it is beef bacon. Just doesn't compare to tasty, crispy pig bacon. And then there was the lack of cheese, definitely could have used more. Then there was the beef patty itself, I am just not entirely sure that it wasn't frozen/store bought as it unfortunately did have that taste. But all of this could have been overlooked and I would have happily continued to frequent flippin burgers as a late night/drunken food stop, if I hadn't encountered the hairs. Yes, hairs. I found not 1 but 2 thick black hairs in my burger and I completely lost every bit of my appetite.  I will not be returning for a hair infested burger, however due to the proximity to my condo and the awesome retro vibe, I would probably return for a milkshake or a bottle of pop. Sorry flippin burgers, I really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"just an ok cheeseburger for the $9 price tag. I loved that they had so many toppings & sauces to choose from - the horseradish was a great addition!  fries were a brutal soggy mess. onion rings were good. service was crabby, but I don't blame them because it was 4 million degrees in there so I'd be crabby too.  I will give them another try - maybe I just went on an off day?"}
