{"text":"A solid OK. They're on Ritual app so I decided to try it. Ordered the crunchy bowl. Some notes:

- Didn't come with too much salmon. Could've been more generous with the protein given the $13 price tag, but the salmon was fresh.
- Rice was perhaps a little too vinegar-y or something. But a pervasive taste of vinegar was the prominent flavour in every bite so I'm assuming it's from the rice and not the sauce...
- Sauce didn't really add too much flavour. Needs more spice or salt or SOMETHING. 

In general, I wish they had more options for the base. Most poke places have a brown rice option and they do not. The overall portion size was consistent to what you get in Toronto- so no points deducted there. 

Not positive if I could come back here. Pokito is still my favourite poke place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered the crunchy poke bowl for lunch yesterday. Seriously disappointed. The flavours were bland, the ingredients didn't go well together, the lettuce wasn't very fresh, they were very skimpy on the salmon, and the overall portion was small. The deep fried onions were the only thing that saved the meal, but definitely not worth its price. For the same price as a poke bowl at Sushi Shop, Sushi Shop's poke bowls with crispy rice tasted waaaaaaaay better."}
{"text":"Pretty simple, this place is fantastic. Picture a sushi roll in a bowl, but better. I've tried poke at a few sushi and poke places nearby, and this place is simply much better than any other spot I have tried.     Different than when I was in Hawaii, but I think I enjoyed it more (salmon vs. tuna).  A must try if you are anywhere nearby."}
{"text":"First time trying Lahuna poke. I went around 1pm on a Friday and the line was pretty short. The staff was very friendly and quick and also offered a stamp card. I ordered the crunchy bowl which had salmon as the protein and white rice as the base. 

The crunchy bowl was a pretty generous size. They give lots of rice on the bottom and a pretty decent amount of salmon. They definitely did not cheap out on the lettuce, cucumbers, edamame and other toppings. They loaded it with lots of rice puffs and nori on top. I added seaweed salad for $1 which they definitely don't cheap out on. 

The amount and toppings they give is very generous however the taste of the protein and the sauce is just not quite there. It didn't taste flavourful enough. Perhaps they didn't give enough of the sauce but even when I tried to mix everything together it was a little \"dry\" and didn't have enough flavour. 

Overall one of the better places for poke in terms of price for what you get, but wasn't all there for flavour in my opinion."}
{"text":"Biggest waste of $15, I threw most of it out.
I had the chicken bowl. 
It tasted like McDonalds tried to make a poke bowl, with iceberge lettuce, bland onion chips, processed watery chicken and a big Mac sauce. On rice. 

Nothing made sense."}
