{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. They're from the east coast, and have now got a location here. I had a donair and donair egg rolls, both were mindblowing. Highly recommended. Can't wait to go back and try everything else.
Also, open late, which in Richmond Hill, a place like this was very much needed!"}
{"text":"First impression is everything! Let me start by saying, im from New York city where some of the best pizza is made.  I work in the area and was really excited to see there was a pizza place opening up in the area. It was a sunny afternoon, I walk in,  its beautifully decorated. There are three men that work there.  I picked up the menu. I say hello with a smile and tell them i work in the area and if its good I'll tell my coworkers to come check it out.  I ask for a slice, pepperoni.  The guy behind the counter gives me two slices behind the glass and places them in from of me. I say, how much do i owe you ? He says, dont worry about it, its not that fresh, ( how stale?
1 day old, 2 days, 3?) no charge.  I said, thank you and I go sit down.  I was hungry. I take a bite. The pizzas not bad  but it's cold.    
 ( do customers have to ask to have their sliced warmed up?)

So, after my hunger subsides, I realize I'm sitting here eating cold, stale, free pizza thinking this is not at all how I'd imagined my first visit to this Alexandra's pizzeria to be. I was ready to taste a slice of good, hot, fresh pepperoni pizza, with cash in hand. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I left the menu there."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery, the donair was great. No point going to 
Milton for an East Coast donair anymore."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this newly opened restaurant and to test them out I ordered the old standard, pepperoni and mushrooms. My daughter is a tough crowd and she really liked this pizza and that's why it gets a 4/5. The crust was light and airy, not thin and not too thick. The sauce is tangy and flavourful with just enough on the pizza to make it moist and juicy. My daughter really liked the cheese and how it was applied over the other ingredients.

The menu is extensive and includes wings, fries, fish and chips (they are an east coast chain), salads, donairs, subs and more. We will order from Alexandra's again and try more things on menu."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Alexandra's pizza. They have awards from some east coast publications on their wall for their pizza, donair and poutine. I had to try them all!

I hadn't had true east-coast Donair in so long, that finding this was such a pleasant surprise. The meat is fresh cut from the spit, flavourful and juicy. The sauce is a perfect accompaniment, sweet and tangy. Served with onions and tomatoes. 

The pizza is reminiscent of Pizza Delight, the east coast chain that used to have locations in Ontario. Very reminiscent.. as in I am having flashbacks reminiscent!  House made dough makes difference here, but what makes it unique is the sweet tomato sauce. Definitely sweeter than you may be used to.

The poutine is also great, and in huge portions! The small is big enough to split. Purists might call these cheese fries, since there's no cheese curds. The cheese is generous and the gravy is rich and there's a lot of it. Very tasty and definite comfort food!

Good place for east-coast style grub!"}
