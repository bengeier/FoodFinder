{"text":"Soul & Sea is a new restaurant in Penn Hills. They have the potential to be amazing once they work the kinks out as they have only been open for a few months. I have ordered several times. Just about each time I have ordered food something was missing and I had to go back to get what was missing. Luckily I only live about a mile from the restaurant. Soul & Sea is the first restaurant for husband and wife team Jermaine and Brittany so they are no doubt still in the learning process.  For my first order I chose the grilled lobster dinner with linguine salad and potato salad as my sides. I also added a few fried shrimp. My wife chose the fried shrimp dinner with linguine salad and potato salad and i ordered my daughter the fried wing dinner with fries and potato salad. I really wanted to try their lobster mac & cheese, but it was sold out. My order was correct, but our daughter was missing her fries so I had to go back and get them and my wife was missing some of her shrimp so I just ended up giving her some of mine. Both my lobster and potato salad were excellent. The linguine salad was ok. My wife and daughter liked their food. My daughters wings were on the small side thought.  The next time I went I got us each a order of their lobster mac & cheese. It was spectacular! Perfectly cooked pasta with lots of gooey cheese and it was loaded with lobster. At the time it only cost $5.99 and came with pretty much a whole lobster tail. It now costs $9.99.    On another visit I got the pork chop dinner with mac & cheese and seafood linguine salad and my wife got the fried shrimp dinner with greens, potato salad and seafood linguine salad. My pork chop was FIRE! One of the best I have ever had in life! The mac & cheese was on point too. My wife was missing her seafood linguine salad so I had to go back again and get hers. The seafood linguine salad was ok, but after tasting my wife's greens I will be sure to get those next time.  On yet another visit I tried their loaded steak potato and my daughter got their loaded shrimp fries. Good lord that is a big potato. It was loaded with steak, red and green peppers and cheese. My only complaint as it could have used some cheese sauce because I ran out of cheese and still had a ton of potato left. I tasted my daughters shrimp fries and they were incredible as well. She also got one of their Royal Waffles which is a lot like getting a funnel cake at Kennywood, but much, much better.  Another time I visited they had a colossal shrimp over yellow rice special. It was spectacular! It was so good that it should be added to the menu permanently! It featured the largest shrimp I have ever seen in my life!  My main complaint with Soul & Sea is consistency as the quality of the food can be different depending on who is cooking on that particular day. At times it may take a while to get your food as it is cooked to order but it is worth the wait. Make sure to double check your food BEFORE you leave so you aren't missing anything.   In the months since they first opened they have been getting better and better by the week. They also deliver up to 15 miles away. Be sure to visit regularly as they have weekly specials which you will not want to miss. I wish Soul & Sea much success as I know that they will work hard to get their restaurant on the right track."}

The courtesy, the timeliness, but wait... the flavors, the combination of surf & turf, my mom was very impressed and so was I. This venue is gaining ground fast. Come eat and quit playing yourself. #NotAGame"}
{"text":"This place is new and it's about to be legendary  The Shrimp dinner was amazing very large shrimp and just the right amount of seasoning. Greens and Yams were exceptional. Bought the Shrimp and Grits for someone else and they were blown away with the grilled shrimp and wanted to know what they did to the grits..They were on Point. It took a little while to get the food but it was definitely worth the wait.  I'm already planning my next visit and what I am going to try."}
{"text":"Such a bummer, this place was excellent but recently closed after a fire. I read that they plan to re-open, and cant wait for them to do so."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken wings are better than the fried chicken wings.. green beans are very well seasoned.  My husband tried the fried lobster & liked it.  I would go back to try other menu items!"}
