{"text":"Service is slow! Don't bother coming here if you want to be fed. A couple of people were waiting and no one came to even get our drink order. It's not a big place so I don't know what the problem was. Really sad as I was looking forward to eating there."}
{"text":"I just ate a delicious, homey, perfectly-balanced bowl of (hot) pork green curry...hot to burn the lips but not the stomach...the lime leaf overwhelms your taste and smell...and the warm, light and creamy spoonful of mouthwatering heat only gets better as you bite down on crisp and delicious strips of bamboo shoot and sweet red pepper...and I got that (to go) at GAATI.  Given that last review (errata: plug), however, I can't wait to try Penn's on Sunset!   I will complain that I got NO spiders (not even a single cricket!) with my meal as I always do.  I mean, is this place ridiculous for not being what I expect a Thai place to be!!?? If not perfect, Gaati is pleasant and spotless.  I love their (AUTHENTIC) food, come here often and appreciate having it around.  So it's OK that one may like Penn's (and give it not one, but two, lengthy and STELLAR reviews...and wished there were more stars?), but I contest (apparently malicious) bug statements (unless some Spring fluke?).  Everyone is entitled to an opinion but some just aim to hurt...and if I agreed, we'd both be wrong.  I can't have enough good Thai food to eat (and I'm an awesome, AWESOME critic of Thai food)....so at least I would follow someone's advice for Penn's... \"Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot.\"  I bet those designs they make from straws really make one feel like \"family\".  If we can't be fair, maybe we SHOULD take our asses back to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Gentlemen button up your shirts and leave the skanks at home, this place is for romance. I like the upscale look but its missing the Thai look. Order was wrong all ready for the first course but instantly taken care care before I could finish typing this sentence. The vegetable egg roll was delicious. The sesame toast is really good! The chicken wonton soup had to much of a beefy taste for me."}
{"text":"It's our second time coming here and we will keep coming.  We started with the chicken Tum yum and chicken egg roll. Both were perfect in flavor, level of spice.  The main course we ordered was the pad thai and panang curry.  Both again were perfect!   Not only is the food good but the service is amazing.  Oh yeah try the homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is super friendly and the food is great. I've been here a few times and every time the food I have ordered has been fresh, delicious and up to standards. The tom yum soup is to die for."}
{"text":"I would recommend the pad thai to anyone! I never likes thai food until I tries Gaati! I would eat here every week if I lived closer. The service is friendly and the food is great! I am glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Takes a lot for me to write a review. I just couldn't let this one go, again! Chicken pad Thai was awful! Twice! Not sure if it's a new cook or what. It lacked flavor and quality. Mongolian beef was not much better. When I first moved here I thought I found a gem. After being here a year and ordering take out several times. I'll never go back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Entering Gaati Thai was a wonderful surprise!  The exterior is a standard shopping center but the interior of the restaurant is elegant in a very comfortable way (lovely but jeans are completely appropriate)... a great place to meet friends, have a quick dinner on a busy night or even go on a date.  Everyone I have taken to Gaati has loved it, too!  The food is excellent, portions are just right and the hot pot soup is not to be missed."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in this new place.  The decor is nice but the food is not good.  We had the yellow curry and it seemed like they left out the coconut milk.  Even the Pad Thai was not great.  They made our kids eat off of paper plates.  And the food is WAY over priced.  I give this place 3 months at best.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Up in Vegas for our daughter's 21st birthday and hoped for a tasty Thai meal on a quiet evening as we wait for all the revelers to fly in the following day.    The meal was outstanding.  Fabulous phad kee mao and equally delicious lemongrass chicken.  Fresh prepared,  incredible play of flavors.  Would love to have this restaurant at home on Scottsdale.  Now we need an excuse to come back to Vegas. Don't forget to try their homemade ice cream.  Recommend thai iced tea ice cream and the coconut ice cream.  Yum."}
{"text":"Great place hidden away in Henderson. They made an appetizer combo for us and WOW. All homemade and great. The Panang Curry was like heaven on earth. Our table also shared Pad Thai and Pad See Ew medium spicy, both great. The homemade Coconut ice cream another special treat. Can't wait to go back and try the Crab Fried Rice. The table next to us had it and said it wasn't to be missed. The staff was so friendly too!!!   Thanks Gaati!!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special.. the food was fresh and very tasteful. I have been a fan and client of the owners of this restaurant.  So happy to have them near my office"}
{"text":"We came here about a month after they opened.  The place was clean and the decor was very tasteful.  The staff was nice, but the food was just awful.  Perhaps we are spoiled by being from Seattle, where some of the best Thai food in the country is available.   Anyways, to continue this short review of Gaati . . .   We always start our test of a new Thai restaurant by ordering two dishes:  Tom Kah Gai and Chicken Pad Thai.  Here, the Chicken Pad Thai was greasy, burnt, oily and salty..    The Tom Kah Gai was awful.  They used milk or cream in it, which does not belong in this dish normally made with coconut milk.  Not only did it have milk or cream in it, but it  had actually curdled!. It was nauseating.  We suspect the cook had some semantic confusion between the word \"milk\" in coconut milk and actual milk.    We didn't finish the food and never went back.  We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this place is totally great!! The ambiance is really chill. The food was probably some of the best Thai food I've ever had in the Vegas area. This place is an absolute must!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas. Price outside of lunch specials is a little on the higher end but if you are spending money going out, it is well worth the few extra bucks. Service is excellent and they are accommodating to vegetarians. No surprise fish sauce here! If you have not tried this place you are missing out."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for 2 years, and I'm pretty Thai-food snobby.  So far this has been the only Thai place I've liked in the Henderson/Vegas area.  Soups and grilled foods are authentic.  Great wine list, especially for a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered our food and drinks. The waiter didn't even have a pen and paper to write our order. When he delivered our beer and poured into the glass . Beer bubbles all over the glass. I told him let me show you how to pour beer correctly. If you're selling beer you should know how to pour beer correctly with no beer bubbles all over! I really don't like to drink my cold beer with all the bubbles. If I am ordering beer on tap then that's totally different. Then our order came in differently with what we expected. The waiter didn't even explained to us that there are two of the same name but different style of preparation. How would the customer know that they have two different style of preparation with same name . So when the food was delivered I was looking for the noodles and he said we ordered the soup. So I said my hubby even pointed out to you what he wanted and you still gave us something different . He should have explained and told Us that we ordered the  soup and not the noodles . The customer won't know that you guys have two of the same name but different preparation.  Will never go back because the waiter insisted that we were the ones that ordered the wrong food.  Had he explained to us we should have known that they have two of the same name but different preparation. Then thats totally another thing.  Super frustrated. But since there's a lot of thai restaurant in the neighborhood why go back to this one when they won't even admit their mistakes!  Not that I wanted to get a free meal! All I wanted to hear is for him to say \"so sorry my mistake\" but he still insisted that it was our mistake. Even though I told him you should have advised us that they have two of the same name but different preparations. But nope he didn't !!!  Well the food sucks anyway . The soup was very very sweet. Taste like I ordered a desert. Not authentic thai soup. I never tasted sweet soup from any thai restaurant I have been and even when we travelled in Thailand. We didn't order a desert soup!  Longest review ever!! should be helpful for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, and great atmosphere! What more can you ask for.? They even have young coconut which is my favorite beverage to have with Thai food. I will be frequently this place often and recommending it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I've gone two times and have had two awesome experiences. The interior is modern and simple, just an overall calm ambience. Food was awesome, the first time around we ordered dinner with the family, Basil Fried Rice was rocking and the Massaman Curry was delicious as well. We started off with some simple Wonton Soup, which was also really pleasant and great for sharing between the four of us.   Second time I went was for the lunch special with my wife. Started with the soup which was incredible (don't remember the name, but it was a coconut base) and followed up with a curry that was also delicious. Five stars all around.   Follow it up with the coconut ice cream, it's got bits of jack fruit. Bomb."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. Enjoy from appetizers to dessert :)   The interior is amazing, Great for a quite date, Small but cozy,   I get out here at least once a month or everyother month to try a new dish."}
{"text":"Food and service was fast. I found the prices to be good, and you get a lot of food.  The Rangoon was fantastic the outside was a little over cooked but it's all about the creamy inside with this dish anyways.  Ordered Pad Thai because it you can't make this right then you have no right claiming to be a Thai Restaurant.  And I'm pleased to say that it was delicious... although not the best I've had.  Also we ordered Ladd na.  Was stated as being really good.  And massa curry was also one of the best we've had."}
{"text":"I love this place a lot. I came in with my friend today  and tried theirs shrimp crab rangoon and pineapple meatball for appetizer. OMG!! It was so good. It's a nice combination of flavor meatball and grill pineapple come with 2 skewers. We got crab fried rice and basil chicken for dinner and a bottle of lychee sake to drink. It was a chunk of real crabmeat for the fried rice.    The service : Very warm welcoming. The owner is from Thailand. She always recommend me theirs new menu every time she's there.   Very nice relaxing asmospear. I always order a bottle of wine, sitting sipping and enjoy very much everything!!!    I definitely would recommend this place to everybody that live in this area and anyone who drove by. :D"}
{"text":"How nice to find a local Thai place that provides quality food, isn't greasy and has good variety. I wasn't as put off by the prices as some of the other reviewers. $11 seems to be the average price for the main courses. That's below many of the other local Thai restaurants in Henderson. The appetizer prices are a bit steeper ($8-$9) but the portion sizes were quite good.  Highlights: Appetizers - beef jerky (great cuts of beef, very little fat, tasty dipping sauce); curry puffs (not greasy at all, delicious sauce, I think we got 5-6 in our order which was more than we could eat.)  Salad - green papaya salad with shrimp. It's a standard. Perhaps a bit pricey for what you get but good flavor.  Mains - one penang curry with shrimp and one pad see ew. Both were good. I've found a lot of restaurants have oily pad see ew but this wasn't the case with ours. Penang curry was flavorful and had lots of shrimp.  Overall, quite pleased! We did take out but will gladly come again and dine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had the War Won Ton and some glass noodles chicken dish, along with the 4 types of appetizers plate. The food was delicious! Not too salty, not too spicy, and served hot and fresh. Waitress was very kind and polite. Place is spotlessly clean, including restroom. We'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Consistently fresh and flavorful! Great ambiance and we order delivery once a week."}
{"text":"Their food taste horrible and the smallest portions EVER. Waste of money and waste of time."}
{"text":"The crispy rice is very crispy. But a bit so sour for me. The Tom yum and the fresh coconut juice is very nice."}
{"text":"I went there to try Thai food for the first time and i was very impressed. It was pretty busy but the food was worth it withount a doubt. I ordered a beef pad thai and it was enough to fill me up and even take the rest home. Their servers were very kind and helpful. 10/10 will be back!"}
{"text":"I was out on business, and found myself here.  The food was great.  I had the curry puff, which was pretty good.  I'm a fan of cucumber relish with these, and there's was pretty good.  My main dish was Pad See Ew with Chicken.  By far my favorite, the noodles were firm and the sauce was perfect.  Atmosphere was pleasing, and definitely new.  A great place to try in my book."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Family has had restaurants in Las Vegas over 30 years that we know of. We remember loving their 1st one on Tropicana. Now they're right here where we live in Henderson. Yea!  Gaati Thai Kitchen has Great food. Excellent soups. Restaurant is very clean with comfortable atmosphere. Sue will always help you order something you'll enjoy. We often order takeout and they deliver. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here all the time. We love it! Spicy basil chicken is a favorite of mine and my wife has been hooked on a coconut curry soup. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Thai Kitchen illuminated sign on wall?   Tinted windows?  Strip mall?   It can only meet low expectations, right?  It is fantastic. Excellent prices and portions for lunch & dinner. Nice, intimate  atmosphere (10 tables) that turns and burns. Full service, professional attitude, with a smile.  The chicken Pad See Ew was excellently presented with sweet soy sauce on top rich, flavorful rice noodles. The house soup is good by itself. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and the chicken was succulent. Laad Na, and Pad Kee Mao is as good or better than what I used to get at Natalie Thai in L.A., or NAGA here in Henderson...without the looooong waits. Plates were unchipped, silverware polished, and clean. Very impressed with the whole business."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! GREAT attentive service, nice quiet ambiance and the best part is their food!!! Its been many years since we have found a our \"go to restaurant\" !!!! Just about anything we have ordered has been outstanding! It sits tucked away off of the main street but they still get plenty of traffic:) Their music is soft flowing and unobtrusive and easy listening!  Do give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful and immense, service outstanding ! Overall great date or family restraunt !"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken and it was average tasting at the best but very dry. The portion was very large and the sauce was decent. I ordered pick-up and it was ready very quick and service was polite. I will give it another shot and try a different dish but will not be ordering the BBQ chicken again."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch. The dining room was spic and span clean. I ordered the green curry with chicken and brown rice, it was excellent!  Fresh veggies and spicy curry. My husband ordered the pad Thai with pork, another excellent dish. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, yet overpriced. We've suggested this place to many of our friends and family. However, after today, I will not recommend this place to anyone ever again.   The service and employees lack customer service and competency. While placing an order for delivery over the phone, the employee was either high or an idiot, but he did not know how to spell, even while I was spelling out our address. Also, I had to constantly tell him, \"Well....do you need my gate code? Do you need my payment information? Are you going to give us the total?\" He was a buffoon! Not only that, but when I asked what our total was, he put us on hold for 10 minutes. I had to call from another phone, only to hear that employee say \"I forgot they were on hold.\"  No amount of taste can make up for the horrible and incompetent staff. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"There are tons of options for Thai food in Vegas. Unfortunately, not many good options. I've had the pleasure of eating here 3 times now. Good stuff and great service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai Restaurants in Henderson.  Rivals some of the more known restaurants in the Las Vegas area. The owner is super friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great new restaurant. Tried the veggies and tofu which was sooo good, I had to have it again the following day. Veggies perfectly done and tofu excellent.  First tried curry puffs and while I'm not a curry person, these were tasty and worth having again. Second time tried the chicken dumplings and again, so tasty and so worth the return visit. To die for?  Try the thai tea or coconut ice cream.  Good luck to this place."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch here today had it delivered ended up being the wrong order when I called the restaurant back and ask for Sue I was told she's no longer the owner they made it right when I got to my house it was horrible the worst Thai food I've ever eaten used to order here all the time never again"}
{"text":"Ok so here is my second review of Gaati Thai. The first one I made was after eating there for the first time last night for dinner (amazing) and the second one is now after having my second meal there for lunch today with my wife. I want to start by stating that I am a chef and usually don't try a new restaurant for at least a few months after they open in order to give them an opportunity to work out the kinks. The restaurant industry is really a tough one and it usually takes a little time to get the staff and chef working in a smooth and homogeneous fashion but after dropping in last night to look at the menu I decided to try it and I couldn't be happier. For lunch today I wanted to try new dishes so we ordered Chicken Satay, Chicken Tom kha , Eggplant Entree and Crispy Pork belly. For dessert we tried the Pumpkin Custard. Here is the break down.   Satay was great. Flavor was really good and liked the peanut sauce.  My one criticism of this dish was that it came out of the kitchen warm and not hot.   The Tom kha was also Great but also a little on the warm side and could have been a little hotter. and it did have that curdled look also (I think that comes from using fresh coconut milk over the canned stuff)   The Eggplant was Fantastic, Tender, not greasy and the flavor was incredible.   The Crispy Pork Belly was flavor wise an 11 on a 1-10 scale but the pieces of pork Belly were on the smaller side so when fried to crisp them up suffered a little and came out a little dry (really just a little) but would benefit from being cut a little larger so that they remain tender and moist when being crisped up.   The Pumpkin custard was Sublime. Warm (in a good way) not to overly sweet like some Thai desserts can be.   Over all I want anyone interested in giving this place a try to know that they will really be trying out a special place. This is better than Lotus of Siam and I LOVE LOTUS OF SIAM. This Place has just been open for a little over a week and they are putting out amazing food. Cant wait to see what they will be serving in a few months."}
{"text":"Finally, a Thai restaurant that has nice ambience AND great food! We had the Gaati house soup (a bit bland, but otherwise nice and different), Thai beef salad (nice, a bit too much lime juice), pad thai (super flavor!, one of the best I've had in a while), and vegetables (great flavor also!) They also have brown rice (yes!). Overall, good portions and very tasty food. Best of all, and this is hard to find, the food wasn't too greasy. We'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch- our first Thai experience. We asked for some suggestions from the very friendly waitress! The food was great! Pad thai vegetables and basil chicken were delicious! Homemade coconut ice cream so good! Will definitely  go back and look forward to trying out the outside seating area!"}
{"text":"I went to this place because Yelp had a good rating and this was closer to home than my usual Thai place.  What a disappointment!!!!  We had shrimp and chicken Pad Thai at our table and also green curry salmon.  We were the only people at a table at 5:30pm on a Wednesday, and that should have been my first clue.  In general, the flavors were good but the textures were terrible.  The pad thai was heavy and gummy and did not taste fresh.  The noodles had a good consistency if you could get past what covered them.  All of the vegetables in all of the dishes were overcooked and limp, especially the bok choy in the salmon dish.  The salmon, however, was cooked appropriately.  As has been said by others, the green curry was very, very, watery.  In fact it was thinner than the diet Coke I had with it.  The mix on their fountain machine was also not correct as there was little carbonation and a slightly acrid flavor.  To add insult to injury, two of us ordered our dishes spicy (they used a 1 to 4 scale), and they came back extremely mild.  When I looked at the final bill, it was clear the waiter did not put our spice level on the order for the two of us that ordered spicy, but did put it on one of the pad thais that was supposed to be mild.  That said, since we were the only ones at a table, the service was quick.  The owner's wife came out and asked if we needed anything, but she was so nice we didn't really want to tell her the truth.  Perhaps she'll read this review.  I cannot understand why the yelp rating of this place is so high.  I've noticed that recent ratings were somewhat low.  Perhaps this place has gone downhill...."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the Las Vegas area.  Their curries, especially the Panang, is  as good or better than any I've had around the world.  They are very willing to customize, to a point any of the menu items.  The staff is courteous and knowledgeable.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's close to my work so I walk there for lunch sometimes.  The service is friendly, very attentive, and fast!  Perfect for my lunch break.  I always get the green curry and it's fabulous!"}
{"text":"Must say first that our food still has not arrived, so I can't review the actual food yet.  But, I cannot make this up.  We ordered delivery over an hour ago and the lady was so nice taking our order.  She called about 1 hour after ordering to tell apologize that her driver took the food out and \"fell asleep\".  I said that I have never heard of such a thing, what do you mean?  She said he works a night job and yeah he fell asleep.  If I wanted the food still, she could have it delivered though she said.  She is re-making it and said she would personally deliver it... crazy."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch with my husband today and was very pleased. The Tom Kha soup was a little too bland for me but the Tom Yum soup was better. We ordered the Spicy Mint Chicken and the Beef Green Curry, both were delicious. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came here as part of a private party and had the best time! The service was top-notch, with the staff being attentive but not overbearing. The restaurant was clean and they even decorated for us with plenty of balloons and lights. Their meatballs are dynamite, and I could eat a whole bowl of their massaman curry- so fragrant and rich but not too heavy. Their Pad Thai was more mild than some and a bit sweet, but it worked well against some of the other spicy flavors. What a wonderful evening out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The service was friendly, the ambience peaceful, and the food DELICIOUS!  The Thai iced tea was very refreshing, they give you a serving of sweet syrup on the side so you decide the sweetness, I really appreciated that. The soup was flavorful and had veggies from the first spoonful to the last. The chicken pad thai had plenty of chicken and the noodles were a perfect texture. The spice was lip- smacking good!  :)"}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is tasty and have good portion to it. Price is fair. It's a hidden gem in Henderson"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Truly authentic, fresh and extremely tasty! Love the atmosphere and the friendly service."}
{"text":"New owner alert! This place changed ownership in April 2014. We ordered the Pad Thai and the chicken satays. The peanut sauce for the satays was very runny and the pad Thai noodles were completely overlooked and greasy (also very little chicken or bean sprouts or peanuts to be found in this Pad Thai). For their prices and where they're located, the food needs to be improved in a big way.   If I want amazing Pad Thai I will need to go to Archi's or at the least, Pin Kaow. The first time we were here, the old owner made the food incredibly well and it was worth the price we paid. But now, it's just not very good."}
{"text":"My friends and I were recently celebrating a bachelorette party in Vegas, and instead of splurging at one of the uber expensive strip hotel restaurants, we decided to get Thai food delivered to Mandalay Bay - The Hotel.  It worked out perfectly--the food arrived as crispy and fresh as ever (chicken curry puffs and veggie egg rolls--oh my GAH *drool*), and we were able to play pre-party bachelorette games while chowing down!  The food was a hit with everyone.  If you want \"Americanized\" Thai, this place may be a bit different.  The food here is authentic, with dishes and flavors you might not find at mainstream Thai restaurants.  I'm from LA, where there's no shortage of Thai establishments, but having experienced the food here, I'm really sad we don't have a place like this in my hometown.  If you had a family member or friend in Thailand who happened to be an awesome chef, these are the types of dishes you could expect to find when invited over for dinner.  Just thinking about that meal now is making me hungry.  Gaati Thai Kitchen--come to Los Angeles!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food! Gaati is really close to my new apt so I decided to try it. The staff are very friendly and attentive.  I've eaten there about half a dozen times now, wanted to make a educated review. The food is on the milder side, even when I have ordered it \"Thai hot\" (started with 2/4 on my first try... I've been burned before, so I've increasingly asked for hotter every time thereafter); maybe it's because I'm  a white guy. Aside from the level of spice/heat; everything has been of excellent quality, served very promptly (so food is hot in temperature and still crispy); between dishes I've ordered, as well as, the rest of my family, I've tried just about everything on the menu. Price is decent, not a bargain nor a rip off. Overall, I  recommend Gaati Thai Kitchen, just be aware that they base their level of spice on the average Anthem retiree."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials and menu, definitely worth going to for a Thai fix. The decor inside makes you completely forget you're in a strip mall, which is a nice touch. It's very convenient to get to and has ample parking.  The dinner menu doesn't offer anything substantially different than lunch, other than prices, but the food and service is good enough to warrant a solid 4 stars.  Their noodle dishes are fantastic, the curry is pretty good but not anything to rave about. I'm a huge curry fan so I'll take a good curry over a great noodle dish."}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout and delivery for over a year. Food is good, but ordered delivery tonight, and received a call 30 minutes later that the restaurant was full, and the kitchen could not fill the order. I asked could if they fill the order if I picked it up, and they could. I cancelled my order, and will not be ordering from them again. Can anyone recommend another Thai restaurant?"}
{"text":"What I had: Roasted Duck and water (to drink)  Price: $20 + tax  The Good: The decor is decent.  The Bad: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for what it is and what it tastes like. I ordered the duck as I was trying to test out the different places that actually served duck. The worst part is that the waitress there had no clue what she was talking about and couldn't even answer my simple questions. I asked her what size the duck was (a whole duck, half duck, or just a single duck breast) and she had to go to the kitchen to find out. She actually lied to me because she told me it was a half (of a whole duck). I got 1/2 a breast it seemed. Also, the duck was horrible. I tasted more like that cheap dark meat they use in some honey chicken chinese dishes and the vegetables tasted like that frozen crap you get out of the grocery store. Like it was just thawed out. for that price ($20) I expected much much more. Even the little box of white rice they gave me tasted bland. Also, they gave me no free appetizers or anything to even snack on like most Asian restaurants would. I was just sitting there for 20 mins with a glass of water waiting for my duck."}
{"text":"Changed job locations so needed to find my new Thai lunch place so Gaati was my first attempt. I ordered Panang Curry with chicken (which is my favorite) and it was ok... a bit too heavy in peanut and their version had peas (not a fan). Their heat index seemed right on and portion size was descent. I think I'll be looking to the next option on the list."}
{"text":"Average Thai food in comfortable dining room.   The room reminds me more of an art gallery than a restaurant, in a good way.  The food reminds me of many other mediocre Thai restaurants I've tried.    The prices here are a little high, but not ridiculous.  I would say come in for the lunch specials during the week to get the most out of Gaati Thai Kitchen.    I came in on President's day (a holiday so no lunch specials) and ordered fresh coconut juice, the curry puffs, and pad see ew, here's the rundown:  Young Coconut -  So refreshing and lovely.  Served with a straw and a spoon, if you've never tried this you really need to.  Be sure to scrape out all that yummy ivory coconut meat after you're done sipping.  The coconut juice pairs really well with spicy food, and it's good for you!  Curry Puffs - Nice fried appetizer.  The flavor of the puff itself wasn't too pronounced, but when eaten with some chili sauce and the cucumber salad/relish it's served with, a very nice way to start the meal out.   Pad See Ew (spicy level 6 out of 10)  - The chinese broccoli wasn't cooked enough, so it had too much crunch for the dish.  The noodles were a bit mushy and again, the flavor was muted.  I can't say it was bad, but it certainly wasn't anything special.     I like the people here and the layout of the restaurant, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Some of the best Thai food I've ever had!! Gotta try the thai beef jerky as an appetizer!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Great Tom Khah soup!! Relatively cheap lunch special. Staff is great, however the decor is missing. It needs some personality!"}
{"text":"The short version: Go here!  It's really good. Don't go here when it's busy, you'll experience long waits and cold food. Make sure and order one star spicier than you normally would.  Let me preface this review by saying I've been here 4 or 5 times prior and it's always been a solid 4-star experience.  So when I came in with family from out of town I had high expectations.   It was Saturday night and the team there seemed overwhelmed by the number of tables.  We were seated next to a few people who were waiting for take-out, and nobody approached our table for quite a while because our server got pulled into smoothing things over with a take-out customer who'd experienced an inordinately long wait.    When she finally arrived our server was sweet as pie and made a point of apologizing for the wait and joking with the table.  We ordered an appetizer (Crispy Shrimp) and 4 entrees (Volcano Chicken, Red Curry, Pad Thai, and Laab Gai...my favorite and something I use as a benchmark for thai restaurants).  Then another long wait, 25 minutes while we enjoyed 2 large Singha...and our appetizer came out.  The Crispy Shrimp were delicious, well-seasoned and piping hot but were served ala tempura plate with a bunch of fried veggies that were not mentioned on the menu description.  They were all room temperature, gummy and unappetizing--clearly everything hadn't been fried at one time and as everybody knows cold is the death of fried food.  Our first entree the Volcano Chicken arrived and it was likewise at room temperature.  Not even slightly warm, had clearly been sitting on a counter not even under a heat lamp for at least 10 minutes.  It was a basic sweet and sour and not really to my liking overall, but being cold definitely didn't help.    Luckily our other entrees didn't show up for a while so after some conversation--my partner and I are loath to make waves when eating out unless necessary--we explained our discontent to the server and asked her to make sure the remaining 3 entrees came out hot.  She was extremely apologetic and our Pad thai and Red curry came out quickly.  They were hot and delicious, only complaint was that they definitely didn't measure up to the spice levels we'd requested.  The Laab Gai arrived really late to the point where we thought they'd forgotten we'd ordered it.  Temperature was good, spice level was low and it was lacking in acid...maybe on account of the current lime shortage? Not the best I've had but I'd give it another shot on a return visit.  Sensing our overall discontent our server and another woman I have to think is the manager or owner came by and let us know they were taking the Volcano Chicken off the bill.  This went a long way in improving our experience and will ensure we continue to dine here...were I rating service alone this would've been a 5 star visit."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could.   First impression is that this is a nice, quiet, casual, yet elegant Thai oasis in the middle of a strip mall.  The decor of modern Asian minimalism in soft lemongrass and wood tones is very warm and inviting.  We were greeted and seated immediately by one of the friendly and attentive waitstaff.  I felt a disconnect almost immediately after being seated.  The large flatscreen televisions, the R&B music complete with expletives, and the noise coming from the back of the house were confusing and distracting for me.  Maybe this is what the market dictates in this area?  I ordered a glass of house Chardonnay and decided to get over it. It was delicious.   We ordered the Tom Kah and Mongolian Beef, both with medium spice.  Both were very good, and worth ordering again in my opinion.  Again, the waitstaff were all friendly and attentive.  I would probably not go back into the restaurant again, but I would definitely order take out from them."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Every order of food was at perfectly desired levels... You can order without a second thought..."}
{"text":"I was unprepared to love Gaati as much as I did. It's a tiny little restaurant that is hard to find if you don't know you're looking for it, but it's easily the best thai food in Henderson. The service is quick and helpful, the food is creative and flavorful, and the atmosphere is quiet and warm. My family orders family style, so I've had most things on the menu by now. Try the jungle curry and pad see ew but be careful...when they say the spicy level is 8, they mean it."}
{"text":"Gaati Thai Kitchen has wonderful food, an inviting atmosphere and excellent staff.  The Thai ice tea is served with the sweetener on the side so you can make the tea as sweet (or unsweet) as you like. The kids love the pineapple fried rice served in a pineapple.  I had my Mother's Day dinner at Gaati and was served an unbelievable Sticky Rice and Mango dessert and fried bananas w/ homemade coconut ice cream. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I called to check if the yellow curry was vegan, they let me know that it could be made that way. I placed an order for spicy level 3 (out of 4) They told me it would be ready in ten minutes. I drove over and walked inside, it was a really cute restaurant, good ambiance that would be perfect for a date night. When I walked in no staff was up front, so I stood there for a few minutes before finally someone peeked out of the kitchen and called for one of the servers. The food was delicious. They gave a good amount of food for the price and I will definitely be getting curry here again! The only thing I didn't like was the cubes of tofu. They were cut so big it was awkward to eat! Other than that, great!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, fresh and delicious it can't get any better than this. I get the spicy shrimp and eggplant and it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent doesn't even begin to describe the food. It was exceptional. Fresh, delicious, and the service was fantastic. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place...glad we tried it tonight. Ambiance was great and place looks clean.  We ordered the following items:  1) Dumplings (5 pcs) = It was pretty good. There are enough meat on each dumpling that made this good appetizer considering it's a little pricey for me. The sauce for the dumpling is quite good as well with a hint of ginger and sweetness to it.  2) Thai Tea = Hubby ordered it and he likes it. It was kinda weird that they give you syrup on the side as their thai tea doesn't come sweet to begin with. It was creamy and the tea flavor is not overwhelming.   3) Panang Tofu (Spiceness #1) = This was very good. It was creamy and the flavor was perfect. The tofu came out perfectly fried yet not hard...it was just right. This is definitely comparable to Archi's panang.  4) Panang Beef (Medium Spiceness) = My brother-in-law ordered this and he was quite happy.  He did say that their medium is more spicy that what he normally gets but he loves it nonetheless.   5) Beef Pad See Ew (Spiceness #1) = I was disappointed on this one unfortunately.  I really want to like it but it was bland and dry. It definitely could more sweet soy sauce. I just wouldn't get this in future.   6) Beef Fried Rice (Spiceness #1) = Hubby ordered this and he loves it. He would like to be a little bit more spicy but that did not disappoint him. He loves the flavor of it so he's a happy camper.  Overall, the food is good. They are pricey considering the portions are fairly small.  The service was good but there were only 3 table (including us). One thing we notice though, the table setting was incomplete. We already had our food and we only had napkins and knife on the table.  The server and busboy doesn't seem to communicate well as we haven't even gotten all our food and the busboy is already taking our plates to start clean up which I find odd. I also have to agree with the other review, it is freezing cold in there. The A/C was on full blast which was unnecessary at night I think but it was too cold to be comfortable.  The communication between staff and the cold A/C is where the 1 star deduction came from. We would definitely be back to try the other foods in the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and LOVED it!  My husband has never liked Thai before. Gaati changed all that! FINALLY I can enjoy Thai on a regular basis with my family!    We had Pad Thai Noodles, Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Pineapple Chicken. Everything was great!  Thank you Gaati! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"For Henderson, I guess it was OK.  It had such good reviews, I figured it would be great.  But it was just OK.    The service was good.  And it's a very lovely restaurant.  It's too bad my boss and I were there smelly and disheveled from the field and looked like a couple of turds among the lilies.  But everyone who served us was very polite and quick, and I appreciate that.    The spring roll type appetizer was OK, though a bit overcooked.  Our entrees were also OK but not particularly good.  I asked for my pad thai medium spicy; Boss asked for his eggplant dish extra-super-spicy.  My pad thai was quite spicy (and I'm not a spicy wimp!), and my boss's eggplant dish was bland.  So they seem to have mixed up the heat levels between the two dishes.    My pad thai, besides being strangely spicy, was quite dry and bland and had neither basil nor lime.  And the shrimp, for which I'm sure I paid quite a bit extra, had that muddy flavor that tells me it's probably a good thing it was way-overcooked.  I suppose that's my fault for ordering any kind of seafood in the middle of the freaking desert.  I might eat here again, but I'd be one of those obnoxious people who specifies lots of things.  \"I'd like peanuts and basil and lime and cilantro and some actual flavor with my pad thai, please.\""}
{"text":"We ordered a ton of stuff from here when our 1st choice Thai restaurant was closed unexpectedly for repairs.  Since that was what I had in mind, perhaps I set the bar too high.  We got lots of appetizers, all of which were \"good\". Nothing remarkable or made us say wow, but not unpalatable either. What stood out were the bbq spare ribs which were fall off the bone outstandingly delicious!!  Not to be missed when ordering from here.  In fact, get two.  The 3 different noodle dishes all basically looked and tasted the same.  I could only tell the difference because of the proteins and one had broccoli in it.  Otherwise, all very similar.  There was nothing necessarily wrong with our meal, but there was no wow factor either.  Just very average.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again.  Not when there is fabulous Thai food in delivery distance from us that always hits the mark.  Sorry, but there is too much competish is this town for mediocre.  Step up your game!   Especially for the listed price point.  What we got should not have cost as much as it did."}
{"text":"They have a beautiful dining room. They have the prices to prove it. I just wish the food was better.   Ordered the chicken tom yum soup. I ordered the small for 8 dollars. I thought I would get more than just 1 3/4 cup of soup. It was REALLY sour. I ordered it medium spicy and it didn't taste spicy at all. The broth was flavorless and the chicken was tough.  Overall, If this place wants to charge Lotus of Siam prices for Lotus of Siam portion sizes, they better have amazing food... unfortunetely its subpar. You'll get better portion sizes for a cheaper price with better quality food at the Pin Kaow down the road on Eastern about 3 minutes away."}
{"text":"To say I am a regular is an understatement. It's almost embarrassing how often I eat here. My regular lunch buddy has strict dietary limitations; Gaati modifies everything so he can eat a real meal.   Prices on the entrees are a tad higher than some other Thai restaurants in town, but I taste the difference in the food. Definitely worth the difference.  The lunch special is awesome for a mere $9 - soup, salad, a curry puff and a main dish with rice. Brown rice is available for an extra buck.   Closed Mondays, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here.  It's casual and very comfortable.  I usually come here for lunch.  The lunch special is a great deal.  Soup, salad an entree for less than $10.00.  Great service and very, very fast!  I love the green curry here and you can get it as mile or as spicy as you like.  One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The best thai restaurant I've been to! On my first visit I had red chicken curry and bbq fried rice and they were the bomb! I had to come back to try other dishes as well. The spare ribs were also very tasty. The pad thai was a bit different than what im used to but it was still great nonetheless."}
{"text":"Was so wanting to love this place. Maybe my expectations were too high since other yelp reviews were good. I was rushed off phone when I finished the order & asked for a price \"I'll call you back\", click, didn't even get to ask for brown rice with my curry. My pumpkin curry was super bland & definitely not medium in heat level, plus they didn't give me the extra chili peppers I requested. I may be a white, born & raised in New England person, but I want to break a sweat when I order spicy Thai. They say their spicy scale is 1-4, so I asked for 3, but no heat maybe a 2 on my beloved Thai Noodle House's 1-10 scale. Luckily I had a jar of sliced green Thai chilies at home, but had to add about 2 tablespoons which added heat but some flavor would have been nice too.  Tried his pad see ew after he declared it \"horrible\". I'd never met a pad see ew I didn't like, until now. Noodles sticky, probably from the starch, not the sauce which was also bland. Plus the veggies in it were not the same as other Thai restaurants - only broccoli & collard-like greens.   I was hoping the food would have made up for the service both when I ordered & when he picked up. But sadly, this is not even on par with the other nearby Thai restaurants on Eastern & near Galleria which only deserved 1-2 visits each. Guess Henderson is not the place for good Thai - need to drive farther into Vegas."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of months ago, but the restaurant looked nice and well kept.  Service was ok and the food was pretty good, but I wasn't wowed at all.  I'd go back if I needed a quick fix for some Thai but that's all"}
{"text":"This by far my FAVORITE Thai restaurant!! Whatever they put in that papaya salad is perfect flavoring.  I must eat here once a week and I am never dissatisfied.   I keep going back for more.  Tom kha Gai, chicken pad Thai and papaya salad are my favorites!!  Love how it's near my home and Service is good!! I will see you soon Gaati!"}
{"text":"I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews, they are correct.  Ordered chicken pad won sen, shrimp pad thai and beef salad to go.  The salad was okay, beef super well done and lacked lettuce.  The dinners had very minimal vegetables which were all overcooked, the chicken and shrimp were overcooked, overall it was a bunch of noodles with not enough sauce or vegetables.    The server seemed nice though and appeared to be a chill environment to dine.  It is a shame the food is not better, it has a good location as well."}
{"text":"I have been here before and thought it was nice. The dinning room is clean and nicely decorated. The last time I came I think the owner was there.This time the waiter was a guy with a very dry personality, not very pleasant at all.At first I took it personal but I watched him interact with other customers and he was the same with them.He is in the wrong business.  I ordered the chicken padti, basil chicken and a side of egg rolls.I asked how many comes in a order, he said 6 so I said ok but he came back later and said 5.I thought that was a lot per order but when I got them I saw why, they were mini rolls like one bite each.Had I known I would not have ordered them.  He asked how spicy I wanted it.I said a 7, he said they only had 1 thru 4, I said 3. My order was to go.The food was very bland and no spice at all.I was very dissapointed. Later my stomach became upset and I spent my evening on the toilet. I know it was this food as it was the only thing I ate that day.  Very upset and dissapointed. I paid alot for the food as well.They are pretty pricey. Won't go back!!"}
{"text":"The worst Asian food I've ever had! Everything was over cooked and I called to talked to the manager who didn't seem to care. Eat somewhere else! Too many great options!"}
{"text":"Found this quaint little place near Trader Joes and Kmart off Eastern Ave. in Henderson. When we walked in we were impressed with the décor. It looked so nice that I thought it was going to be expensive. To our surprised the menu prices were pretty reasonable. The food was tasty and delicious. Our party ordered sweet and sour chicken lunch special and it came with salad, soup and a hefty stuff wonton. The portions were a good size. Someone else order crab friend rice and wow was it good. I ordered pad thai and it was decent. WARNING: Their spice range is on point. When they say hot...It's going to be hot. My lips and tongue were on fire! When your brow sweats you know it's hot. So order a level down and it will be perfect. Anyways we will be definitely visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've had in years  What I was the most impressed about Gaati is that their sauces and ingredients are fresh, and the balance in flavor is unadulterated, authentic.    Many Thai restaurants I've been to try to put too much sugar in the food and it doesn't taste right, but Gaati has the right amount of heat, great flavors and just a really pleasant presentation of food!   I absolutely love this place!  What we ordered:  1. Treasure bags--very crispy, very flavorful chicken and corn filling, amazing appetizer  2. Satay pork--perfectly cooked.  delicious marinade  3.  chicken curry puffs--really good  4. Pad Thai--best Pad Thai in America!   Very spicy, very fresh, it's just so different from the other pad thai's I've had!  5. Pad kra pow chicken--chicken with chili and basil, it's so delicious with rice.  6.  Chicken Tom Kah--really dense broth with very good flavors.    Great openner to any dish.  7. Fresh green curry--OMG so fresh it's amazing!  8. Crispy pork belly with Chinese broccoli--excellent flavors, crispy, and the gai lan is still a bit crunchy which is nice  9. the minced chicken dish served in lettuce cups--very refreshing!  All in all, I love this place.   I would drive from LA to Henderson just for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ordered pineapple fried rice at a hefty price of 16 bucks and it was shown to come in a pineapple and have shrimp inside. Well when we got our food delivered it had 2 shrimps inside a normal metal delivery container. Needless to say we paid 16 bucks for some rice. Not happy at all.  Our total order was over 40 bucks and was not worth the hefty price. We called to ask how many shrimp should be inside and the girl on the phone had an answer of \"I don't know\"."}
{"text":"Place is horrible Cold rice, ordered everything medium-hot it was sweet Paid additional $3 for shrimp there were 4 shrimp total in the pad Thai... The catfish came as little chunks  The salad was wilted Paid $70 and am completely upset If it weren't for my girlfriend picking this up out of the goodness of her heart I'd take it back but I just had surgery  WHO POSSIBLY RATED THIS PLACE 4 STARS wish I cooked it myself their chefs are an embarrassment to Thai food"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner on Sunday, July 26,2015 and picked up within 20 minutes - nice!  We ordered the yellow chicken curry (hot), pork pad see ew (hot), crispy rice salad (hot), spicy basil (hot), crab fried rice (hot), and bbq spare ribs.  Food can be ordered on a scale from \"not hot\" to \"Thai hot\", with \"hot\" being the 2nd to highest.  They did a nice job on the heat!  We forgot to order the curry with no heat, and my son's poor girlfriend was drinking milk (which she doesn't enjoy) to try to cool her burning mouth.  The rest of us loved it!  I really liked the crispy rice salad - it was nice having a cool dish, and the lettuce and rice were crisp.  The pad see ew was very good as well, with the flavors well married but not overly sweet and the broccoli was perfectly cooked.  The crab fried rice was a nice surprise and something new to try - it was very tasty with nice sizes of crab meat.  The spicy basil had a nice basil flavor but was a bit too sweet.  I was too full by then and never got around to trying the curry or ribs.  When I picked up the order, the restaurant was quiet.  It's very pretty, with cloth tabletops and a relaxing vibe.  I like the view of the outdoor landscaping from the side glass door.  Our To Go order came served in rectangle plastic containers (yea! no styrofoam) with clear lids, and for the most part the servings were quite generous.  The odd one was the spicy basil, which was quite a small portion and the curry was a smaller portion than expected (served in a plastic cylinder-shaped container).  Thank you, Gatti Thai, for a lovely meal!"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance, totally appropriate for intimate gathering. Service was relatively prompt. We had the chicken pad Thai, beef green curry, and a scoop of the coconut ice cream. When we received the dishes I noticed immediately that the portion sizes were a little on the small side; I could probably count the bamboo shoots in the curry on 2 hands, and the rice came in the same size dish I used to serve butter in when I worked at a restaurant back in the day. It was easy to overlook a bit because the flavors on the noodles were definitely there, the green curry was good (not great), and the ice cream had good flavor even if the consistency had a lot to be desired. We ordered the entrees at a level-2 (of 4) in spice and I typically add more chili powder once it's on my plate but I was surprised when it had a nice little kick to it. If you're sensitive to spice, get the chili on the side. Overall, if it wasn't for the nice ambiance and the service this would for sure be a 3-Star review.    PROS: Pad Thai (chicken) had good flavor.  Menu featured duck.  Ambiance is nice.  Service was prompt.   CONS: Beef in our green curry was kind of tough.  No pork on the menu, whaaaa?! Coconut ice cream was especially icy. Where's the rest of my food? (Portion size, even on the side of rice were less than generous)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but there are better Thai places in the area. I think the portion sizes were a bit small for the price, and there was nothing particularly exciting about the restaurant. The restaurant was small, so probably not a good place for a large group."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is that the service is constantly fabulous the food is wonderful and the company divine. Love everything about it is specially the too young lady sitting next to us."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great ambiance and comfortable chairs.  The food and service are great.  My favorite items were the crab rangoon and the chicken satay.  The satay peanut sauce was so good I wanted to drink it.  Save room for the homemade coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Good curry puffs. Crispy rice salad too salty. Pad Thai a bit greasy. Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so relaxing and we love coming here Friday night after a long week. The food is also addictive. I had the rama chicken (grilled chicken and spinach with peanut sauce) during our first visit and it was very tasty, though I might see if it's possible to add a little spice another time. My husband loved his massaman curry! During our second visit, the food was about a level spicier than we were expecting, but still delectable! I ordered beef pad see ew which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the jungle curry which is a bit more soup like and he really enjoyed it too! On another note, sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but the food is well worth the visit! We love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I have to say this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever had.  Without even the slightest reservation I will say they have the best crab rangoon I've ever had.  Their green curry and pad Thai are also amazing.  What a sweet surprise to have such a delicious dinner.  :)"}
{"text":"I like the interior of the place; its got a nice warm modern feel to it. Selection of food choices are a bit different from other thai places; there seems to be chinese style dishes mixed with thai dishes and this meant there were fewer choices for thai ones.  I had the pork belly with chinese broccoli (with jasmin rice) and it was quite tasty.  Not overcooked or too over-spiced. Overall the experience was good; service was good and it wasnt crowded at all for a saturday night.   Prices are slightly higher than other thai places in the area and the food was not exactly better so I'll just stick with my current fav siri thai."}
{"text":"Their Tom Kha was one of the best richest flavors in town! Unfortunately, their Thai basil beef is not made traditionally with minced meat but does have a wonderful flavor as well. The pananag was a BIG let down as it was more of a soup than a \"paste\" like panang should be. Will just have to skip that when eating here, but everything was pretty Delish!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying this place for over year now and they are very consistent in service and food quality as well as great taste. I enjoy eating in the restaurant and every much enjoyed their delivery service. I highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Small, casual place located inside a plaza off eastern. I was just looking for a casual spot for lunch and I did find that.   They have happy hour menu items and I ordered the edamame. Not a bad portion size however, the edamame were pretty sad looking. I was expecting full, plump edamame but was disappointed in the quality of it. It was like they microwaved a bag from the freezer section and put it on the plate. I had to ask for a plate for the shells. It wasn't busy at all but the waiters were not moving with any sense of urgency when being asked for things by the 3 patrons eating lunch.  I ordered the spicy eggplant which is something I always order from thai places. This one was extremely greasy and when I asked for mild heat, I didn't know that meant ZERO heat because I didn't even taste a hint. I ordered it with vegetables instead of rice and there were barely any added to the entree. I'll probably look for another thai place in the area rather than coming back here."}
{"text":"What a gem! Ambiance, service and presentation were all great. The food was delicious. I had the green curry which they were able to modify as I am vegan. It looks like most items on their menu can be modified if you are vegetarian or vegan. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for Thai. It is decorated very classy without trying to hard. It is always clean, and the service is great. The food is very tasty and fresh. I have become a regular here"}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch special of pad Thai. This is my first visit and most likely my last. I love Thai food and have been to many establishments around the valley. I had high hopes since this place had decent reviews.  Prices were a little more than I usually pay, but I figure if it's good than it doesn't matter.  I ordered a number 7 spice, it was so bland I had to add my own salt and chili sauce at home.  I ordered extra bean sprouts and was charged $2 which is overly priced and have never been charged extra at any time restaurant I been to. I didn't think much of it until I got home and there wasn't extra at all!   The curry puff was still frozen inside so it's obviously was not made fresh. The soup was okay, but also on the bland side.  I'm disappointed in this visit. So sad because the decor and service was great hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered crab fried rice and tom yum shrimp. I am always put off when tom yum does not come with straw mushrooms, so this was my first disappointment. My daughter wanted to try the crab fried rice, and the crab was overcooked. Portion sizes were smaller than other restaurants in area, and it was a bit more pricey. I will not return."}
{"text":"This eatery has its ups and down. We recently ordered take out curries and wings. It was as good as when they first opened. So glad we gave it another shot. Very prompt service as well. Takes only 15 minutes! Guess the curry paste is all ready and all they have to do is put in the protein."}
{"text":"I have a territory in Henderson and once a week  I will taste a Thai lunch special red curry. This is the second time I have eaten at Gaati and the food is of a higher standard than everyone else. The curry is creamer  than any other and the spring rolls taste homemade."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, we were not expecting to find a nicely decorated restaurant with such vibrant aesthetics.  Being tucked away in the corner of Eastern Blvd and Horizon Ridge Pkwy, this is a dope spot for casual dining with a group or even with just a table for two.  --Thai beef jerky: great flavors from the spices they used to marinate the meat.  Dish comes with dipping sauce which wasn't too salty unlike what other joints usually serve.  Order a side of sticky rice and you're good to go.   --Spicy grilled beef salad: could have used extra toasted rice but the skirt steak was tender and chili-lime vinaigrette was good.   --Pad Thai: typical Thai style thin noodles sauteed with eggs, bean sprouts, chives and crushed peanuts.  Got it in 'hot' and thought it would've been 9/10 if it were from a different place.  **Spiciness from this establishment runs hotter than others... have your dish in 'medium' instead and just add more crushed peppers to suit your taste buds.   --Pineapple fried rice (shrimp, chicken, fresh pineapples, roasted cashews) that was actually served in whole pineapple shell.  I like the mixture of savory and sweet, however, seasoning was lacking as the dish was quite bland.  Overall, Gaati Thai Kitchen is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants around Southeast Las Vegas.  Delicious food, nice ambiance and great service.  They also have a daily happy hour with drink specials and reduced price on certain appetizers."}
{"text":"Have been here about a dozen times in the past two years and the food is always fantastic: very flavorful and never greasy/oily. The service is always polite and fast, and I love the calm ambiance. The new grilled Brussels Sprouts appetizer is delicious, as are all the curries. I do wish they offered fresh spring rolls (the type wrapped in rice paper filled with basil, fresh vegetables, and tofu) with peanut sauce."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and everything that I have had has been wonderful. I absolutely love the Papaya Salad, the peanuts give it a great crunch and add texture to the dish. The coconut chicken soup is creamy and rich. The entrees are delish too. I have been to Thailand and this is the best since I have been back. The coconut icecream is homemade and very good (not too sweet). The lunch options are great with a great value. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place delivers! *heart eyes emoji*  I work in a medical building that's about a 5 min drive from this place. Sometimes when days are super busy, I like to order for delivery just so I don't have to leave my fellow staff without help. They are always on time if not faster than expected!  Food is always fresh, flavorful, and the staff are very courteous and kind. My favorite is the Pad Kee Maow or Pad See Ew. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to eat lunch this afternoon. First of all, we came with our 8 month old daughter in her infant carrier and they put us at a table right next to the kitchen. And I mean the closest possible table to the kitchen. I ordered the Thai pad chicken lunch special, he ordered Fat see u beef. My salad came first with my Miso soup and  they were both ok. My Pad Thai came out and we waited almost 10 minutes for his entree. All this time I was waiting for his food, so we could eat together. When I finally took a bite, the Pad Thai was EXTREMELY hot when I asked for Medium. I noticed it was practically covered in Chili flakes. I politely asked if they could tone down the spicy and they took the plate back, all the while I heard the cooks and waiter talking junk about us in the kitchen. My boyfriend's food comes out and his isn't even hot. Almost another 15 minutes goes by until I get my new Pad Thai which was alot less spicy but also looked watery and soupy. Finally, after another 10 minutes my curry puffs that were supposed to come with my soup and salad come out and they are burnt to a crisp. I asked the waiter for new ones since I wouldn't be eating those. My boyfriend wanted to just walk out but I insisted we stay because I was hungry. Long story short, the waiter asked me AT LEAST 6 times if everything was ok. Felt kind of weird. When we were done,  I had to wait almost 15 more minutes for the check. Almost an hour after we get home from lunch, I'm vomiting constantly and although I might not have food poisoning, I am headed to the hospital. I truly believe these people did something shady to my food. I will never be back and I warn everyone that goes there about asking to fix or modify a dish might leave you in my situation. This place is my new least favorite restaurant. And just before you go judging my tone about this incident, my boyfriend and I both work as a server and a manager at 2 different restaurants here in Vegas, one off the strip and the other on the strip and neither of us had ever given or experienced as bad service as we dealt with today."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service was without attention to detail. I'll go back, but I expect better service.  MISSES:  1) Five in our party, four menus given.   2) Someone in our party was brought the wrong entree.   3) Water was asked for, one glass for one person not brought out.  4) Bill and credit card receipt was brought out without a pen.   Again, I'll go back, but service will have to be better than this or ill go back to my favorites Lotus of Siam or Archie's."}
{"text":"Like a few others before me mentioned I should have taken a look at the reviews before visiting.  I ordered Thai beef jerky $10.00) as an appetizer and to their recognition it was tender, tasty and seemed like it was a high quality meat, however this would be the only good experience with their food that day.    We dined around 2:30 so they still had their lunch specials running, my girlfriend and I both ordered the Mongolian beef ($9.99) which came with a soup and house salad.  I also ordered Thai house fried rice $11.00 + $4.00 if you want to add a meat).  They have a spice level of 1-4,  I ordered at 3 and she at a 2.    The salad would be as you expected however the dressing was extremely sweet, almost to a point that when eating the Thai jerky it changed its flavor profile and not in a good way.  The soup was a cream based soup and very bland.  When the main meal arrived I was shocked at how absolutely small the portions were.  I wasn't expected a main meal portion do to it being a lunch special however the portion of rice I would equate to an ice cream scoop and the beef contained less that a cup and was lodes high with rice noodles.  The food was bland at the very least and what flavor it did have was so sweet I took one bite and had the waiter return it.  I figured I would be content with the fried rice when it arrived but it had less flavor then the beef and consistency was more like uncle bens rice.  The waiter was professional and did take these items off the bill, but it was clear with one bite from each dish it was not enjoyed and he didn't ask for feedback but I certainly gave it.  The only thing I didn't add is the decor was nice but seemed very Americanized and the prices at this place are not on par with the quality.  Their prices seem more fine dining when it should be more like a fast food China a go go.  I have no plans on returning however if you do choose to go here I suggest ordering at a spicy level 4 and going before 3 and take advantage of the lunch special."}
{"text":"The Happy hour specials we ate made a wonderful combination for my husband and I - the Mango salad and the Curry puffs complimented each other with the dressing and sauce they came with!  BBQ chicken is marinated just right and their coconut ice cream has these wonderful tidbits of tropical flavor from the jackfruit (Lanka) they add to their homemade recipe. We will be back for more Happy Hours!"}
{"text":"By far my most favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. Wonderful flavors, very consistent, nice atmosphere. There is room for some improvement with their service, as well as the amount of rice they serve with their curry. Take-out, however, seems to have portions that are more generous. My favorites: Massaman Curry- rich flavor, not to sweet. Pad See Ew- perfectly balanced sauce. Tom Kha Gai- wonderfully balanced as well. Pad Thai- not too tangy, not too sweet. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had food delivered and it was great.  I ordered the crispy duck and bbq fried rice. My duck was nice and crispy without being greasy and my fried rice was wonderful.  My food was delivered quickly and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Thai; this is a great Thai restaurant. It was bought in the last year or so, so there is new management, though I never ate there before. The food is very fresh, the Thai spices are right on, and the menu has more than just the traditional dishes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just ordered the Panang  curry for pickup. It is excellent. Not overly sweet and has the consistency of gravy with slivers of peppers in it. DELICIOUS YUMMY !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious place! My go-to for Thai since my reg place has disappointed me time after time. Gaati is consistently tasty and their quality is on point."}
{"text":"Great dining experience! The food and service were wonderful and I did not have one single bad experience. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Must be under new ownership. Ordered take out and it was awful, if I were eating there it would all have been sent back. Definitely won't be going back!!!"}
{"text":"The crab rangoon is the best I have had because I don't like onion and this one is without. I ordered online and an hour and a half later I called to check where the order was. A very nice lady told me that it had just went out for delivery and if I hadn't gotten it within 10 minutes to please call back. 30 minutes later... nothing. I called and a man tells me that hey never received my order but I was very close and they could have it to me in 10 minutes if I still wanted it. I'm not sure how he knew I was close because I hadn't told him my address, only my name to find the order (which they never got). It seems they had gotten the order and misplaced it, which is fine if they would have just admitted their mistake. He offered a free Thai iced tea for the trouble. I clarified my order twice with him to not have onions... it showed up with massive chunks of onion, over 2 1/2 hours late, and full price. I am incredibly disappointed & don't believe I will be dining here again."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for good Thai food  in the neighborhood for a long time. Last week I happen to see Gaati Thai Kitchen while on my way to work. I decided to go for Lunch the same day, which I'm glad I  did.  I have been here 3 times for Lunch and once for dinner, my girlfriend and I both agree that Gaati Thai Kitchen remains by far the best Thai food I've had on both coasts.  My favorite dish there, the Pad Thai, is better than the Pad Thai I've had in Thailand. The noodles are firm, never soggy, and the flavor is always well balanced. The Chicken (a must) is extremely fresh, large quantity, and generous. Their curries are all fantastic -- over the course of four visits, my favorite curry has grown to be the Massaman curry. Chicken Tom Kah,Crab Fried Rice are awesome too.  Friendly staff makes the atmosphere even better. Their desserts are great (especially Gaati Thai Sundae and Fried Banana with Thai Coconut Ice Cream)  I recommend going there for lunch, as although the portions are good, the prices are a LOT cheaper (approx $9 will get you a nice lunch special) Parking is convenient so  you can cross that of the list."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. House made coconut ice cream is to die for. Highly recommend spicy beef salad!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm rather picky about my Thai food. But a visiting friend checked out Yelp and we decided to give this place a try.   We're vegan and I ordered the mild green curry with mixed vegetables and jasmine rice. DELICIOUS! We also ordered a plate of veggie spring rolls. Seriously, so good. I would go back JUST for more spring rolls!   The waitstaff was extremely attentive, my water glass wasn't even 1/4 way down from the top and they rushed right over to refill it. When I asked the rest to be put in to-go containers, they made sure to provide us with extra rice to take home with us also.   VERY good, I'll definitely be back. I live in Summerlin, but for amazing food and service like this, I have no problem driving to Henderson for it!  It's a great little place tucked in the corner, very classy decor. (VERY clean bathrooms too! big plus!)"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and when the food came it tasted all like plastic or dirty dishwater. I honestly don't know if we just caught them on a bad day or if this is the quality of food they put out all the time. $50 bucks in the trash. What a shame."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special Yellow curry with chicken. Came with rice, salad, soup and pastry. Overall food and service was good."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night for dinner with family. We waited for more than 30 minutes after ordering, we finally had to ask the server to check on our dishes when there was no sign of our food coming when we saw tables that came after us getting their food. And when the food finally came, we found out that they forgot to put the order in on a dish. They were, however, able to bring out the dish within a few minutes. This made us wonder why the other dishes took so long.   The food is okay, not traditional Thai in our opinion. Portions are okay as well, typical Thai food portions. The service was subpar to say the least, not very organized and not very experienced staff. If you are looking for traditional Thai food, this is probably not the place. Pretty disappointed with the experience, will not likely to return."}
{"text":"I like it. One of my two favorite Thai food places in Las Vegas.  Everything was as expected for Thai food and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. We order food their pretty consistently. I prefer the take- out experience over the dine in experience. Yummy Thai food! I want more of that coconut water. Pad se ew and Pad thai are mine and my husbands favorite dishes! I also like their tofu.They also have quick delivery and great customer service"}
{"text":"This is my local neighborhood Thai choice, when I need a last minute meal to take home I call ahead to pick-up... usually the spicy basil or eggplant dish. Very accommodating for vegan friends- i am always so surprised how good they are at clarifying about the ingredients! Nice to experience that type of service. I have also enjoyed their lunch specials too...nice portion size for me.   Last time I was disappointed with the amount of Chinese broccoli in my pad see ew but glad it still packed the normal punch of tasty, yummy flavors."}
{"text":"We forgot to post on yelp, but a few days ago we ordered food for delivery. This is the worst place to get your food delivery. They were supposed to be here an hour ago and its been and hour and a half they said the driver was lost. The food had arrived and it was cold, and very soggy. Who would eat there meal when the curry lid was not on correct and split all over the bag they and forgot one of our items. It was a hot mess. The meat was over cooked to hard to chew, and this place is totally not worth the money. I found better Thai places before that I rather go to... We ordered the pineapple fried rice, and not worth the money. The meals just was not pleasant and this was a totally waste of money."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Chicken Pad Thai at Gaati Thai Kitchen. Hands down the best I've had since I left Asia in December. The Curry Puffs were also quite great. I thought the delivery price was a tad high, at $3 (we're less than .5 miles away). Lesson learned though- just go pick it up! And I definitely will in the future, quite often."}
{"text":"What happened to you Gaati!?! Every time we ordered from you it is usually  a hit. A few times it was not consistent. This time is the last straw... We ordered delivery of $50 of the chicken pad Thai, broccoli with fried pork, tofu paw see wheewwwwww and mango sticky rice. With a side order of the vinegar green chili.   Once we got our order to the door, both noodle dishes lacked favor. We barely even see the meat/tofu. And they said the side order of chili was rotten so they didn't put that in. It's one of the best part to put in the noodles if you want a tangy hot kick to the dish. And to top it off... the mango dessert looks like they give us half of a rotten mango WITHOUT the coconut sauce. WTF. This order was not worth over $50 for shitty food.   You guys lost a customer."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant. The staff are friendly, the restaurant is clean and inviting, and the food is especially memorable. I'm a big noodle fan, so pad see ew is always a must. And their pineapple fried rice is amazing! It comes in a pineapple with hefty portions of perfectly seasoned chicken and shrimp. Yum!"}
{"text":"Me and a few coworkers went here for lunch today. Lunch for us is 11-12. We arrived at 11:10 and were the first ones in. Atmosphere was really nice and seemed clean. Good start! Glance at the lunch menu (somewhat limited) and quickly decide our orders. Placed our order, and began to wait. And wait. And wait. About 20 minutes later, we saw the cook walk through the front door! Next thing we hear are pots and pans shuffling around and finally some food being cooked. About 10 minutes later, we finally get our soup and salad. Then about 5-10 minutes after that, food arrives.  The food was pretty decent, but portion size was small for the spicy basal and sweet and sour chicken. Pad Thai was a good portion, however we only received 2 shrimp with the combination plate. Just 2? Hmm.. We ended up being late to work because it took so long. Why open the restaurant if the cook isn't there? Just an overall bad experience that unfortunately helped us decide never to return."}
{"text":"This is my first Thai restaurant since I've relocated from LA. We started with Chicken Satay as our appertzer. I found it to be very tender. My daughter did not care for the peanut sauce. For my main entrée I ordered traditional Pad Thai with shrimp. I found the rice noodles very petite and tight. The shrimp was surprisingly larger than I expected. My daughter ordered Crab fried rice. She found it to be fishy with a heavy egg taste. She was not expecting a heavy egg taste. It distracted from the blended flavors. My husband ordered the Pineapple Chicken.  He loved the taste, but he felt it could have had  more bellpeppers and onions. We also tried the Thai tea. I thought it was great. My daughter thought too much cream. Dad order a Coke he was happy. Would we come back.....probably not. Would I recommend...no. The service was great and the first impress was nice."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Had the lunch special with my mom. Sates & pad Thai. The creme corn soup is AMAZING! Very nice atmosphere and staff. Only reason not a 5 star is we requested no onions in my moms dish and it had onions. Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"First time trying Gaati, was highly recommended by both my friend and by another friend of my wifes. We ordered pad thai, yellow curry, and stuffed chicken wing. Yellow curry was ok but super light in the chicken and loaded with undercooked potatoes and carrots. Pad thai was pretty bad, lacked flavors, lacked peanuts, no limes, and no sauces, but worst of all seemed very old like leftovers, was one gelatonous cubular mass in the container solid as a whole yet composed of very mushy noodles. I had to cut it like lasagna to plate for my family. Stuffed chicken wings were ok, Ive had better at siri thai for much less, and siri thai isnt exactly the standard of excellence for thai in henderson either, readers may remember siri was famously caught last year by the health dept recycling rice off of bussed dirty dishes from the dining room. I would go 2 stars but pad thai is the one dish that better be good at a thai place, and their prices are just as high as pin kaew at no where near the quality. Too bad pin kaew is scary with old half rotten seafood as well, the search for decent thai in henderson goes on."}
{"text":"How can you beat grt. food, fabulous service, reasonable prices, AND honest staff?  Lost my wedding ring at Gaati's Thai Kitchen.  Called the nxt. day and bus boy, Francisco, had found it.  Yowza!  What's the chance of that?  The mango salad and green curry were delicious!  THNX!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST curries you'll ever have!! Gaati has a really classy atmosphere and the waiter is really nice, always checking if you need anything. When you walk in here it seems like you'll have a pretty hefty bill, but they have reasonable prices with 5 star meals. Trust me you'll be coming back here again just craving the taste of their food"}
{"text":"Crab ragoons we're very good. Duck was a little dry and not spicy as advertised. Pad Thai noodles did not taste fresh, but my husband still enjoyed it. Probably not eat here again"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, Food is good but not great, Just never quite what we have come to expect"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. The Pad Thai is fabulous. I had mine medium which balanced the sweet and spicy perfectly. The staff is friendly and on point with taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"Came here wanting to try a new restaurant and being a huge fan of Thai food.. I'm glad I tried this place. Such a welcoming and clean atmosphere. Definitely has a romantic setting if you're trying to go on a date. Server was very kind and knowledgeable with everything on the menu. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and it was certainly an enjoyable dish with fried rice tucked into a fresh pineapple with shrimp and chicken. I'm usually not a fan of pineapple fried rice but it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend ordered the choo Chee salmon which had a kick of spiciness to it but indeed it was delicious as well. It also had eggplant which I thought complemented the salmon perfectly. I wish I had room to try the mango sticky rice which seeing other pictures on yelp looked really good but it definitely gives me a reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Authetic, fresh Thai food.  Made fresh and lots of flavor. I will go back here for certain!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the Las Vegas valley!! I've tried many Thai restaurants but this one is but far the best. Amazingly delicious food, fabulous atmosphere, superior quality,  and excellent service. Totally worth the price. Try it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a broken record by repeating what many have said BUT, I so wanted to like this place too and didn't. It's closer than our go to place, Pinkaow so we were happy to see a new Thai place in our area.  My husband had his favorite Spicy Chicken Mint and I had Pad Kee Mao with tofu. The noodles were good but the chicken dish had way too much sliced onion and the spice level was way off. I'm not exaggerating when i say about half of the dish was sliced onion. My husband has a pretty high tolerance for spice but went with their \"medium\" spicy. To test out our first order. It was way hotter than it should have been. He normally gets the \"Thai Spicy\" from Pinkaow, which is just above their 10 level but said Gaatis medium was just as hot if not hotter. For a medium spice level, it was way too hot. The prices are slightly higher than Pinkaow but you get less food.  I figure maybe we need to give them a second shot and order other dishes but based on our first experience, it would be hard to go back when we know what we are going to get from our other reliable go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Great customer service. It is a bit relaxed in atmosphere so it's not a get in, get food, get out type place. Gives perfect timing for sitting and talking with your friends, family, or business partners. I loved the food and they had great timing with it. The wait staff was friendly and professional. :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on August 4, 2015.    Of the 10 different things we ordered 9 of them were 5-star!  The chicken salad was 1-star.  Delivery took a little over an hour -- a bit slower than the app projected.  5-Star Entrees included: Red shrimp curry mild Eggplant medium Pad Thai mild Pineapple Chicken mild Beef salad mild Coconut milk soup mild  Although portion sizes were a little small, we will definitely order again.  With tip the total charge was $144.00 -- a good (not great) value"}
{"text":"Liked the service and he food. We got the crispy fried duck and cashew nut chicken. All really flavorful and delicious.   My friend got the Thai Tea and loved it. Although the caffeine made his hyper. Ha!  I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Best thai food I ever had. My husband and I tried this place because we were looking for a new closer Thai restaurant. We had the red tofu curry, pad Thai noodles and the wonton soup. Everything was amazing, the flavor the presentation and the portions are good to share and take a little left over home.  The  wonton soup  was the small size and it was enough to share, I love that it had a little of everything and a lot of flavor. The curry was creamy, not too strong and the tofu had actually good flavor. The noodles were amazing. Service was friendly and efficient, the dinning area is nicely decorated.  We will definitely be back.This place will be our new number 1 option for Thai food, I will tell my friends about it."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw a Thai restaurant opening so close to home but ugh, so disappointed.  I should have known to run when instead of asking what spice level I wanted on a scale of one to ten they asked if i wanted hot medium or mild.   I ordered the Tom yum soup (hot) and got a bowl of bland broth (maybe just hot water?) with huge chunks of chicken and one shrimp, nothing more.  I also ordered the green curry (again hot) and it was literally the worst I've ever had.  Thai food is all about flavor, this was just tasteless blah.  I'm giving them two stars cause the brown rice was cooked perfectly and my friends pad Thai was ok, but again, just ok.  Very disappointing :-("}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Henderson! A hidden gem, I wish more people knew about.  The food is delicious (the best) and service friendly.  Great for dine in, take out, or delivery.  And I love that they have goblet wine glasses. :)"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Always the best service and delivery! Food is fresh, hot and delicious! You definitely pay for what you order! Fried rice combo is the best and the pan seared dumplings make you wishing you had made an extra order. Prompt delivery and very reasonably timed. Best recommendation and desrves all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is not your average Thai restaurant.  It's traditional but gourmet with pricing comparable to others in town.  Love, love their Tom Kha Ghai and Tom Yum soups!  My absolute favorite is their Panang curry!  They make the best in town!  What I love about this place is the freshness of the ingredients in their food.  You can definitely tell.  Also, it's hard to find blazing hot Thai food.  I often order \"Thai\" hot, meaning \"beads of sweat on my forehead, nose-running and I'm-on-my-third-glass-of-water-but-I'm-only-halfway-through-my-meal\" HOT, but rarely any restaurant ever deliver the heat.  These guys will warn you and give it to you!  Yeah!  It's unfortunate that they are tucked in the back of the K-Mart shopping center.  It definitely hurts their business.  They are a bit under staff but if you are not in any rush and have the time to smell the roses, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Finally! Found a really nice Thai restaurant in Henderson. The crab rangoon was *perfect* (I'm a bit of a crab rangoon snob).  The pan-seared dumplings were quite good--they were a bit greasy and were stuck together and fell apart when I gently tried to separate them, but they were flavorful and yummy! BBQ chicken entree was nicely seasoned, subtle and nice. Dinged 1 star due to dumplings sticking together and falling apart when separated, and that I found a pebble in the rice or chicken. But 7 stars for the crab rangoon, and overall elevation of the whole experience way beyond what you usually find in Henderson NV."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! I got the lunch special with chicken and garlic sautéed veggies, fast service, food hot & fresh! Friendly nice atmosphere! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had the lemongrass chicken and the spicy eggplant with tofu.  We also had the dumplings for an appetizer. It was all very good."}
{"text":"I like this place. Easy for take out too. Reasonable pricing and very tasty.  It's good for dinner and lunch."}
{"text":"its tucked away in a shopping center- but so convenient when staying at the home wood suites across the street.  i ordered take out and the staff chatted with me while i waited- i had the chicken curry puffs, and some other items,  i ordered them medium and they were closer to hot for me. thai ice tea was great- not to sweet."}
{"text":"The last time I dined at Gaati was around June in 2013, though I'm eager to return when I get the chance. At the time I ordered a chicken pad siew and a Thai tea. It was my first time trying Thai tea and I found it to be very creamy and sweet. Not necessarily something I'd order with dinner but it certainly didn't detract from the meal.  I had ordered the pad siew mild, but the waitress seemed to have misheard me and said she would get me a medium. I figured the difference would be minor enough that I didn't mind the mishearing but the food at Gaati definitely runs hot. My tongue was already a bit sensitive from some sour candies I'd eaten earlier that day and I ended up in tears as I ate my meal. It was so exceptionally delicious that I didn't care that it was far spicier than expected- I did choose to eat at a Thai restaurant, after all. I ended up overwhelmed and took home plenty of tasty left-overs (eaten cold in hope it would be easier to get through). Despite the difficulty, I'd happily order the pad siew medium again.  The decor was tasteful with dim lighting. I ate there with family but it looks like it'd be perfect for a date night. I definitely recommend this place for Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"It's no secret I eat Thai food every chance I get. That's what happens when you are raised on bland casseroles and french bread pizzas. Gaati proved to me that even Thai food can be quite bland.  Let's start with the good. The three stars are for the Pad Kee Mao and the BBQ Chicken. I salute you for these dishes. The noodles were not oily at all and the spice was spot on. The BBQ Chicken rocked my world even after I removed the skin it still had such intense flavor.  The chicken even looks bangin'.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fknU3sWplCBn26b6HwJ1kQ?select=97JwL9i1u5RdcY0oB6DUog#TtsrNGujlDzYETlZ6SyByg   Now for the bad and the ugly.   1. UNINVITED GUEST: We saw two spiders crawling on the table. One on a plate and the other just pimp walking across the table. I hate to put a beautiful restaurant such as Gaati on blast, but HELL NO I don't want spiders skinny dipping in my food. Even if it is extra protein. How do you say no bueno in Thai? Now add the eff word and that's what I'm sayin'.  2. BELOW TO AVERAGE DISHES:  Back to the food. I also sampled the Green Curry which had zero flavor and runny sauce. The Pad Thai and Tom Kha were mediocre and the Red Curry had too much going on at once. The spices seemed to be playing Fight Club in my mouth. Yeah, yeah. I know, I'm not suppose to talk about Fight Club. Bite me.  3. PRICES: Gaati is overpriced. If the food made me fall in love I wouldn't be complaining. But, it didn't. Add the spiders to the mix and I think the shit should be free.   Plain and simple I will not be returning.  Just because the restaurant is visually attractive and the service was average doesn't mean the food is going to completely stimulate my taste buds. Especially when there are bugs involved.    In a dance off Gaati Thai doesn't stand a chance against other Thai restaurants in town. It can't even hear the beat and it might only have one leg with a webbed foot and a throbbing bunion. It can't stand on that leg, period.  APPROVAL DENIED."}
{"text":"The best pad Thai I've ever had... And I eat a lot of this stuff---"}
{"text":"We just walked out of this establishment, after having been seated and left alone with menus for 10 minutes. Tables around us were already seated and they had no drinks.  We watched as the guy that seated us walked around filling water glasses. We decided to walk down to Pei Wei for carryout instead.   Two stars for the comfortable chairs though."}
{"text":"Tried the $9 special with the Green Curry Chicken and I must say it was pretty good. It's a great lunch special to get three courses for that price. You get a soup, small salad nothing special but the dressing is bomb.  The veggies are what stand out most. They are fresh and cut very well and integrated into the curry to perfection.  I'll be returning to try the Yellow Curry which is my personal favorite. Decor is super nice, and it's worth the $9 lunch special. Thai Tea also perfect. Why not a 5 star? Wasn't that blown away by the Green Curry and maybe it could've used more chicken but hey, it's a lunch special.  Worth a try. Enjoy.  I'm bumping it to a full 5 stars. Just had the Spicy Basil Chicken and it was so bomb. Only thing is you'll be craving more."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good,  I was not too font of the crab puffs though. The Pad Thai was good, the hot was actually hot. They were fast, friendly and not too expensive. I would go again but will not get the crab puffs."}
{"text":"So I've stumbled upon this place because I miss my friends mothers cooking and I was in dire need of some Thai food. Its located in the Kmart parking lot next to this lash salon and Idk what else. As I walked in i was hesitant on the food since there was only one other couple.   I ordered my usually skeptical meal for a Thai place of Pah thai with tofu, yellow curry, jasmine rice and papaya salad. Everything and I mean everything was amazing!!! How can this place be empty?!?!!   Service was great, ambiance was chill, music was nice, restaurant was super clean, etc etc etc!!!   The most recent visit we ordered papaya salad, sea bass, and pad Thai. The fish was steamed to  perfection! We wanted the fried fish but they were sold out!!!! Next time...but she said the steamed was better anyways and I was sold. It came with fresh ginger ans bak choy with a thick kinda soy sauce...amazing!   I hope this place gets its recognition but please don't get too busy when I come"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were pleasantly surprised with this Thai restaurant. He's never really had Thai food before. I, on the other hand, was born and raised in New York where there are so many different restaurants. We walked in and immediately thought we might not like it there because it was absolutely empty. There was one other couple on their way out.   Eve was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful when it came to deciding what to get from the menu. Our water glasses were never empty and she checked in a couple of times to make sure everything was ok.  We decided to order the pad Thai with beef and Massaman curry with chicken. Though I thought it was delicious, the pad Thai was a bit too sweet for my liking but the hubby loved it. The beef was tender and there was a generous amount. The Massaman curry was absolutely scrumptious! The pieces of chicken were very tender and they practically melted in my mouth. The sauce was savory, sweet with a bit of spice. Their servings are generous and it was too much for the two of us. We ended up taking the leftovers home and had a yummy dinner too!   I highly recommend this place. They're clean, service is quick, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and were so impressed by the quality of food that arrived. First time eating from here but will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The Massaman Curry with Tofu will change your life forever! Probably the best Thai food in the valley."}
{"text":"So i'm eating my left overs and as i was chewing , i felt something cracking and felt like a piece of glass!!  I spit it out and that white little thing was in my food!!!!!! I was lucky it didnt swallow it . Be careful next time prepping the food , cuz you might have a suit filed against you if you're not careful again!"}
{"text":"Great Curry Puffs!  Prices are a little high but it's great quality food. Their service is great and have a very friendly staff as well. Big, huge thumbs up to the cooks who keep the food authentic and so tasty."}
{"text":"We decided to do a Fried Rice fest the other night and ordered several fried rice dishes from Gaati Thai Kitchen in Henderson. We were blown away by the quality and flavors of the various dishes we ordered. Definitely going to try the rest of the menu soon, but if you're ever looking for outstanding fried rice dishes this place should be top of your list."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and so delicious! Crab fried rice is the best we've had (lots of good-sized sweet crab chunks and egg !) Soup was incredible (ordered with mixed veggies, no meat, sweet and sour broth base had unreal flavor). Pat-see-yu also super tasty!"}
{"text":"Was craving their soup. I had it delivered to my hotel room after a long flight. There was no spoon. No napkins. I contacted them saying it's frustrating to drink my dinner and use my finders to pick the noodles out of the soup. They chose not to make it right. I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Food was amazing.. Such great flavor to all dishes and the service was great. Love the decor as well. My new favorite place to get Panang curry.. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"High quality ingredients. The absolutely best eggplant dish ever. Last time I ordered w/mixed vegetables instead of chicken, and that was a fabulous combination. The veggies included plenty of fresh baby Bok Choy, broccoli, carrots.', etc. amazing flavors and not greasy and not over salted. My son who spent a semester in Thailand said it is authentic Thai food. Also tasted pad she ew. Amazing. Curry chicken was also excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service casual and comfortable dining room. Outdoor dining for those rare days... Waiting... :)  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here for lunch and for dinner and have really enjoyed the food that we've tried. This place has quickly become our go-to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite Thai place in Henderson! There are quite a few to choose from in the neighborhood but this place is my favorite so far. Came on a Saturday night and got seated right away. The ambiance is casual but looks upscale on the inside. Super cute interior design with a modern touch. My favorite was the big island that had a few high top seatings. Everything was just super cute.  We started off wit their dumplings.. which were aaaamazing. You could tell they were handmade with love. For entrees we got pad see ew with tofu and panang curry with chicken. The pad see ew had just the right amount of sweet & salty, the sauce wasn't too over powering like some other places I've tried. The panang curry was also very tasty, for those of you that like coconut & peanut flavor. This curry is my fave! It was drizzled with a little coconut milk to top if off.   For the entrees you can also choose the spicy ness level from 1-4, so choose wisely!   I loved that service was quick and wasn't too crowded for the weekend. Can't wait to come back for my next Thai fix."}
{"text":"After dining at this kitchen a few years back, when it first opened, I was hesitant to try it again. But after reading some glowing reviews I decided to give it another shot. And I'm so glad I did! I ordered takeout as I have a cold and was craving some spicey Thai food. It was exactly what I was looking for- fresh, the flavors were perfectly married, and it wasn't too light, too heavy, it was just right. It hit the spot! I ordered the lunch special: the curry puff was absolutely delicious, full of chicken, carrots, curry and potatoes in some kind of pastry. Yumm!! The egg drop soup was light and flavorful and the small side salad had a nice sesame type dressing on it. The green curry with jasmine rice was amazing! Exactly how a good green curry should be, with crispy tofu (that's what I ordered) just right potatoes, zucchini and bamboo shoots with the perfect amount of crunch plus some yummy Thai basil thrown in. I have definitely found our new Thai place and am so glad have it a second chance!"}
{"text":"First experience was take-out a few months ago....most recently, two dine-in visits over the last month.  Love the atmosphere, comfortable seating, nice music and tv's available for times when you just want to watch a game. Favorites so far: -beef thai fried rice -pineapple chicken -thai tea Service is friendly, food is good, might take a bit for orders to come out and price is a tad on the high side, but so far overall great experiences - so will continue to visit when I'm in the mood for thai food."}
{"text":"Joined a couple coworkers here after work so didn't get a chance to check Yelp beforehand. My general impression was that quality control is iffy and I think the variance in reviews on here (esp. from fellow Elites) may confirm that.  We had the chicken satay, curry puffs, pad kee mao with shrimp, spicy basil chicken, green curry salmon, and taramind crispy duck. The meats were high quality (esp. the salmon and shrimp) and the meat itself was prepared well. The reason I say \"meat itself\" is that the crispy duck was breaded with a tough, distinct layer - basically sweet and sour pork style (literally like how Panda Express did it... at least back when they still had pork), which was just awful. It was a lot better after scraping the breading off, but then it wasn't crispy duck anymore.  The vegetables were also totally overcooked in everything except the spicy basil - literally, completely mushy. And everything here was on the super sweet side, to the point that many of our dishes were coming across our taste buds very similarly.  Also, their spiciness scale is from 1-4 and we got 3 on everything and it was what I would call mild. Would definitely go straight for 4 if I go back.  The service did not help. Our waiter was friendly but also very casual and inattentive. For example, he got our drink orders wrong and splashed us with water refills, and we would repeatedly have to follow-up on requests that he'd forgotten, etc. etc.  To be honest, this place probably deserves a +1* just because there aren't many Thai restaurants in Henderson - but based on my visit here, the reality is I doubt I'd go again."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful! The food is absolutely delicious and their service is on point!  I ordered DELIVERY from them twice while working a show at Green Valley Ranch Hotel! They were able to service our teams large order and specifically label all items as requested! They also were able to deliver the items to me as quickly as possible! Greatly greatly appreciate such wonderful service!  They did such a great job we ordered from them multiple times."}
{"text":"If you are craving for Thai food, come to Gaati! Food is good and service was good as well! I had the spicy basil with chicken... Ummmm, ummmm, ummmmm good! And for dessert, my friends and I tried the mango with sticky rice! Yum-Oh! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I took my Mom to lunch yesterday and I am glad we ate here.  The food was delicate, flavorful, and prepared and served beautifully.  We started out with a green papaya salad called Som Tum and curry chicken puffs.  The salad was delicious!  Tangy, savory, clean, refreshing, crisp, nutty, with a hint of heat.  The puffs...they are so good that we both could have eaten more.  We then had chicken panang and pad thai.  Both were scrumptious.    Service was very good.  Refills before we had to ask, clean plates after our first courses, and they carried our leftovers to the back to package up for take away.  I would rate this place 4 1/2 out of 5.  Definitely a great Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and great tasting!  Service was very fast and the food was high quality.  We had the Spicy Basil Chicken and the Spicy basil fried rice.  Great job, Gaati's!!!  We will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, outstanding service once again by Francisco and fair prices... Can there be anything more! My husband and I have eaten here a couple of times each having different dishes and appetizers, Pad kee Mao, spicy basil fried rice, jungle curry, green curry,treasure bags and chicken satay... ALL were fabulous!  Lucky for us they're close to home but if not, we'd drive across the city for our GAATI fix!"}
{"text":"My friend was really craving Thai food for lunch today. The place was new to me, so naturally, I obliged.  Gaati Thai Kitchen is located on Eastern and Horizon Ridge near the now-closed K-Mart. I have nothing to report otherwise on the location because it was a to-go phoned-in order which I had nothing to do with other than eating.  Pad See Ew with Beef ($11): a little less rich than my preferred takes on the dish, but it had the right sauces, fairly luscious noodles, and crunchy Chinese broccoli. The mild spicy level was not that noticeable, which is fine with me. However, much of the beef was too chewy. I might shy away from beef if I were to order from here again.  Red Curry with Chicken ($11): not too much of a killer at medium heat aside from the one or two bites of chili pepper which I encountered. Definitely enjoyed the coconut and peanut notes in the sauce and the various veggies, including zucchini, bamboo shoots, and bell peppers. White rice, included in the order, was fine.  Main issue for me, other than the beef, was the pricing. The portions are comparable with other Thai restaurants where entrees cost only $7-$9, and the flavors are on par at best.  Gaati is fine if you're stuck in the neighborhood, but it's not necessary at all to go out of your way to try their overpriced takes on typical Thai cuisine. There are cheaper spots all over town if you want slightly better food, as well as significantly better restaurants if you're going to pay double digits."}
{"text":"Recently opened, the owner and her sister (the chef) bring flare and freshness to the Anthem area! The food is awesome! I try to order something different every time I come. So far I have been very impressed!   I recommend the pineapple fried rice (served in a pineapple, pad see ew, masamann curry, and Volcano Chicken (they flambe it table side!!). Their papaya salad is served with grilled shrimp and the veggies are so fresh and crisp.  I also recommend trying their lunch menu which is an app with an entree for around $10.   Their heat scale is mild-medium-hot-Thai hot. I usually get Thai hot which like an 8 on my 1-10 scale, but I'm sure for some it could be a bit hot. ;)"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh and more importantly vegan friendly. Also delivery is a super plus and it's easy to order online! Highly recommended.  *Update*  I seriously can't tell you how awesome the staff is at Gaati! They made a special papaya salad just for us with no shrimp and no fish sauce. They always go above and beyond - and if you haven't ordered from here yet you should!  *Update 2*  Just a note for those with shellfish allergies - avoid all curries as they all contain fish sauce, as do most noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Love the Rama Chicken. Get it with steamed noodles and it's awesome! Thai coffee is like dessert. Yum"}
{"text":"I don't eat Thai food anywhere else. The food is so good that you will crave it. Do yourself a favor and run to this place for dinner. You will not be disappointed.  Great customer service and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Saturday 8 PM, went to their website and ordered online. It is currently 10 PM and the food has not arrived yet. When I called them after one hour delay they said the food was on the way, this has not been true. Do not order online.   Food arrived at 10 PM. Fortunately for them the food was delicious.   Summary.... Dine In!"}
{"text":"I know Thai food and this restaurant rocks!  I had the $9 lunch special Thai Red Chicken Curry, spice level of medium with brown rice for $1 more.  Delicioious and with just the right spice.  Full of coconut milk and loads of tender chicken and bamboo shoots and fresh vege like zuchinni  and carrots.  It also came with a choice of soup or salad.  I decided with the Chicken Tom Kah Soup - coconut milk but a sour twist in the soup - medium spicy.  Just the right amount of heat for me!    BTW, Gaati means Coconut Milk."}
{"text":"AmaIng food.  Tried it for the first time tonight.  Delivery was slow but most certainly worth the wait.  Ribs very tender, crab fried rice was off the hook!"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food in Las Vegas. Superb curries, pad Thai, lard na, pad see ewe, Tom yum, spicy chicken mint, pineapple fried rice, sticky rice are all delicious. As much flavor as heat, the way it should be. Nice intimate atmosphere and excellent service. Owners are friendly and accessible. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The food was typical American style that food. There were no lunch specials. There was basically nothing special to distinguish this restaurant from any other Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has improved from a 3 star to 5 in ingredient quality and receipt quality. Been back since the new owner took over and in 5 times, its been amazing. Cheers and congrats"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Without a doubt, Gatti has the best Thai food in Las Vegas!  I love Thai food and have eaten at many of the restaurants around the valley and Gatti is head and shoulders above the others!"}
{"text":"This place and location is great! I've come here several times and ordered to go because my friends were in St. Rose Hospital. Their pad-see-ewe is one of the bests here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went out to lunch the other day looking for a new place to eat. We were early and we're the only ones in the restaurant. The waitress was very attentive and informative about the meal selections. All the food was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely return and enjoy this delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food. I had my dinner of dumplings and hot spice level Pad Thai delivered. It arrived in 30 min instead of the estimated 45-60! Nothing stuck out as extraordinary (with the taste) but I was very impressed with how quickly it was delivered."}
{"text":"Environment was nice and clean. Service was great and quick. I had the salad with house dressing, it was delicious!!! Mongolian beef was a little watery, I like the sauce a little thicker. It was good though. I also had the homemadeThai tea ice cream. It was yummy!! Looking forward to return to try the pad thai noodles, my favorite ;)"}
{"text":"My husband, me, and both our mothers split a Thai beef salad and each put a portion on our plates. We tried it and it was unbearably salty. I like salty food but the salad was coated in it. The owner was serving us, so we called her over and asked if we could take it back explaining it was too salty. She looked at the plate it was served in with a questioning look and said \"..but you ate almost all of it\" ignoring the salad on our own plates. She took it away then came back and   added with attitude that the chef doesn't think it's too salty. For a new family owned restaurant like this I would have imagined a more customer friendly experience. Never going back. I've had better and cheaper thai food elsewhere. Wish there was a Thai Cuisine on this side of town. They have the best Tom Yum Goong. 2/17/17 Skip this place and go to Lucki Thai on Silverado and Bermuda. You won't get inconsistent flavors there."}
{"text":"Gaati is located across town from me, so this was my very first visit. Service was good -- nothing bad to say but nothing astonishing that I should note either. What really captured me was the food.  My friends and I ordered the curry puffs as appetizers to start which were good. We then shared a bowl of crab fried rice and pad see ew.   I'm a huge fan of Thai food and love love love Pad Thai and Pad See Ew dishes. However, I find that most places don't satisfy my Pad See Ew cravings. The Pad See Ew at Gaati was delicious -- the noodles tasted fresh and smooth, not chunky and gross as in other places. The taste was just right... not too salty, not too spicy, not too yeck. The beef was cooked just perfect as well. The beef was not chewy like gum nor was it disgusting and tasted like fake meat. really enjoyed the Pad See Ew w/ beef.  The crab fried rice was average to me. The crab did taste pretty good and, unlike some other places, had a pretty distinct part of the dish (some other places you can barely tell there is crab in your crab fried rice).  I would come here again for the Pad See Ew alone!  My only complaint is the pricing is a little high compared to most Thai restaurants I've been to, especially being that this is more on the casual side despite the slightly upscale ambience."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Gaati Thai Kitchen this evening and were extremely pleased. He had wanted to go to our usual Thai place, which is Pin Kaow. I wanted to try Gaati, as we live in the area and it's relatively new. We were thrilled with this new addition to our neighborhood! The atmosphere was modern and very pleasing to the eye. The service was absolutely outstanding. Our server spent time talking to us, and was extremely friendly. The manager also came out to talk with us. This is a family-owned restaurant, and the owners and staff made us feel very comfortable.  We ordered Treasure Bags for an appetizer, and not only was the presentation impressive, the food itself was delicious. For a main course, we ordered Panang curry and Pad Thai. I've been searching for this particular taste of Pad Thai for many years, and I finally found it again here at Gaati. The food was absolutely delicious, a feast for the senses.   With a combination of delicious food and fantastic customer service, we'll certainly be visiting Gaati Thai Kitchen again very soon!"}
{"text":"I always make the schlep to Gaati (from the Strip) when I'm in LV for business. Green curry salmon is my default for dinner. If your constitution permits, order it \"Thai hot\" (as opposed to \"gringo hot,\" I imagine). Homemade coconut ice cream is the bomb diggity, too."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday for lunch-- right at 11:30 and I was the first party here. Lunch special is great! I ordered the Pad Thai and it came with soup, salad, and a crispy curry pocket. A friend ordered their Pomegranate Ginger fizzy drink which was delicious. It had some lemonade which gave it a little tang and is very refreshing for a warm day.   I'll definitely keep this place in mind when I'm craving Thai for lunch on a workday. It's about 25 min from the strip and 15 min from the airport."}
{"text":"Brought more friends to Gaati for lunch.  We ALL loved everything we ordered and it was fun to taste several things on the menu.  We had the curry puffs, dumplings(sauce is divine) and Tom Yum Koong to share as starters.  I always order a 10 on the spice scale and today I broke a sweat- it was perfect!  My girlfriend on the other hand can't handle the heat so I recommended a 3, but she went for a 5. She loved it.  My friends are curry lovers so they tried the yellow curry and the red curry lunch specials and there wasn't anything left on their plates.  My favorite is the Thai Chicken Salad - I've been craving it since my last visit last week. Just  thinking about it makes my mouth water. YUM. But to top it off we shared an authentic Thai dessert so they brought us out the Pumpkin Custard.  I've never tasted anything like it.  It was sweet (but not too sweet), warm and oh soooo delicious. I tried just to eat a small bite but couldn't help eating my whole portion."}
{"text":"Gaati's paypaya salad is out of this world!  I love that they deliver and I order fro them at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is a special gem  in 89052! Their food is so fresh and delicious! The staff is always very courteous. My favorite dishes to order are the stuffed chicken wings and papaya salad. I have dined at Lotus of Siam and I honestly feel like their quality and flavors are right on par with them. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and fantastic service. I am excited there is a Thai place near my house that doesn't just serve all the boring usuals. I went with a large group so I got to try multiple dishes. The Shrimp Tom Yum we ordered spicy and it was spot-on. I ordered the Green Curry with chicken and asked for it medium and it wasn't really hot at all. A friend ordered Pad Thai and it was better than most places. My favorite was the BBQ Chicken! I would definitely get that again. Two of my friends ordered it. I tried the Spicy Eggplant and it was okay but not really my style. I also got to try the Red Curry which my friend ordered hot and it was definitely hot. Lastly, the Pad Kee Mao was super delish! I would love to go back as there are several other items on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Food was really good.. And they don't kid on how spicy every spicy is!!! Be careful!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in a while! The pineapple fried rice is served in a pineapple! Bomb diggity! Get the coconut Thai iced tea Or coconut water server in a coconut yup rad"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to take me out on a date and we chose this Thai restaurant.  Upon entering this establishment, I was struck by the ambiance - classy and casual. Dim lights, lovely table settings, and very hospitable staff.  Moving onto the food - it was amazing. We ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum hot pot, but vegetarian style, and Pad Thai, both medium spiciness. I, myself, am a bit wary of any level of spiciness as I've had many bad experiences with that with the chefs being a bit heavy-handed with the spice with anything \"mild\" and on. However, these two dishes might make me re-think that and become more adventurous. Both were perfect with their spicy flavor. The hot pot was light and hearty and the serving size for 2 people was more than enough.  (Yay for leftovers!). The Pad Thai was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy with the noodles being al dente. Upon hearing me telling that my mom has been trying to make Pad Thai and has come close to having an amazing dish but it still feels like it's missing something, the waitress informed me that that was probably because the noodles that were used were the stuff that needed to be soaked in water. This restaurants Pad Thai was homemade. My boyfriend, being the world traveler that he is, told the waitress that this was the best Pad Thai since he's travels outside of Bangkok. For dessert, they gave us complimentary Thai ice cream - also homemade!  The price of the dishes were decent for the serving sizes.   Before this thai food experience, I enjoyed Thai food but wasn't a fan. I can now say that I am a fan of Thai food."}
{"text":"Home sick for the day so I looked for somewhere that delivers and these guys don't disappoint. Fast delivery and still hot. Didn't eat very much today and this is hitting the spot!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. I was craving Thai food the other night and hadn't had Thai food on this side of town before but the yelp pictures for Gaati Thai Kitchen looked so good I immediately called in my order for takeout.  I ordered my standby of chicken pad Thai and after seeing the photos, added an order of the pineapple fried rice as well. I liked getting to choose the spice level for each of the dishes (a little spicy for the pad Thai and as mild as possible for the pineapple fried rice as I knew I'd be sharing that for lunch the following day). The pad Thai was nutty and delicious and everything I had hoped for (I probably could've made two meals out of the order as well but it was so good I couldn't resist) but the major stand out was the pineapple fried rice. It was sweet, savory, and had an amazing slightly curry taste. The rice was filled with cashews, chicken, a few shrimp, and plenty of pineapple. That did make 2 generous servings and I will be going back for that dish especially.   In total, I think I've found a Thai restaurant to go to on this side of the valley which I'm really excited about. I like that they have both a really nice looking dining room to dine in but that I can also call and pick up a super tasty meal. The price felt a little expensive, but with the 2 dishes I could've gotten 4 generous servings out of it, and everything was so good that the price was more than worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, food and prices. Love it and looking forward to trying the Duck. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I am a super picky eater and this is one of best Thai places I've been.. Hidden treasure for sure! We had the Thai spare ribs, BBQ fries rice, chicken pad Thai and the volcano chicken. The combination of flavors in the food made me not want to stop eating. I didn't think anything was too salty.. Barely tasted salt. We asked for our food medium spicy and it came out just how we ordered it.. Which is always nice. This is the second time I've been here in a week and I pretty sure I'll be back soon so I can share this gem with others. Oh and the staff is super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food and an amazing atmosphere unlike most places in the Valley.  We had the curry and the pork belly and broccoli they were great.  The happy hour is worth the trip too."}
{"text":"Very good basil fried rice and tom kha soup. Very pleasent service, clean n quiet restaurant. A bit overpriced. Worth trying"}
{"text":"Tried again thinking sometime had changed.  Nope.  Food was cold and noodles clumped together in a huge ball.  Slow service.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing curries that are creamy and flavorful. I love the yellow curry and my fiance always gets the red curry. We also love the beef jerky which is a good portion size and also very tasty. We get takeout from Gaati probably once a week and the food is consistently yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with  my boyfriend. When we walked in, there was nobody else eating there. I don't know if that's normal for them not to be busy. But anyways, it has a very quiet and calming atmosphere, great escape from the las vegas heat and chaos. I ordered the thai ice tea, which is SO YUMMY, but you can't have a free refill on them :(   I also ordered an appetizer called little gift baskets or something, and it was very good, well worth it. There were 4 of them, quite small, but filled with delicious chicken. Then ordered the vegetarian pad thai. Now this is where I got a little disappointed. It was a little below average for me. It left a metallic after-taste in my mouth for the rest of the day. I've had tastier pad thai. You'll probably have better luck ordering a different main dish. It seems people really like them, as the whole time people kept coming in picking up their To-Go orders.   Overall, it was a great experience (- the pad thai, this is the only reason I gave it 4/5 stars). The staff is very friendly and the place is kinda small and kept very clean."}
{"text":"How I have wanted to love Gaati Thai Kitchen.  Being so closed to my house, there really aren't that many good Thai restaurants nearby.  Here's my breakdown:  1 star belongs to ambiance of the restaurant.  It's quiet and somewhat romantic.    2 stars belong to the quality of the food.  We tried the shrimp tom yum soup, papaya salad, red curry with chicken, spicy eggplant with tofu and pad thai.  The food was either bland or too salty.  The only thing I would rave about is their shrimps.  Their shrimps were really fresh.    Unfortunately, I won't be returning to Gaati Thai Kitchen for its food."}
{"text":"The Beginning:  A friend and I have ate at this location before and it wasn't memorable - besides the fact that the catfish was too overcooked the first time around. Today, I decided to give it another shot for dinner. When my friend and I got there initially, there were four tables - three already eating and one couple waiting for their order. We sat down next to two other couples and ordered the larb gai lettuce cups. After ordering, the other table was waiting for their food and becoming impatient as he kept sighing and exhaling deeply.    The Middle:  I understood his frustration shortly after - it took 30-35 minutes just to get our appetizer - the larb gai. The larb gai itself was underwhelming - the chicken was overcooked and all the seasoning in the center of the dish where the broth was. My friend tasted a small spoonful and didn't bother eating it though she was hungry. By this time, the restaurant starting to get their dinner crowd and there was a total of  eight tables, along with to-go orders. We were trying to get a busser or another server's attention since our server was nonexistent for most of the meal. I had to raise my voice to get the busser to finally come over. When I did get his attention, I had inquired what was taking so long, he walked to the back to check. I watched him walk back to where the kitchen drape was, but he didn't bother going through. By this time, 50 minutes have passed and I had to again, raise my voice to get attention of the busser as he was going by the other tables but ours. I asked him if he checked on our meal, he said it's coming (he still didn't physically walk in the kitchen area to check since the last time I spoke to him). Finally, an hour into walking in the restaurant, I had to wave my arm to our waitress and ask what was taking  so long. By this time, my friend and I were becoming uneasy and irritated. She said that it'd take another 10 minutes for the food to come and we were trying to explain that we were already waiting for an hour. We had a schedule to keep and had to tell her that if we didn't get our food before the 10 minutes, we have to leave to keep our appointment. The first dish came out five minutes later, followed by the two other soon after. The dinner was composed of:  Basil Chicken Fried Rice: It was lacking taste - there wasn't enough salt or pepper and it was bland. We asked for it to be medium spice and it just wasn't there. The only Basil taste I got was when you bit into the basil leaf itself - the flavors were not throughout the dish.  Garlic Eggplant - We get this dish at every Thai restaurant we go and it was not physically appealing to look it. The sauce looked like it was watered down and the eggplant itself had a unflattering color to it. We don't ever judge a dish by its presentation so we decided to taste. There was no taste to the dish - the sauce was bland and the eggplant was overcooked. We also asked for the dish to be medium spice and there was NONE. Two dishes in a Thai restaurant that lack spice is certainly a new one for me.  Pad Thai Chicken - The sauce itself was there - it had just the right amount of sweet, along with the medium spice. However, the noodles were undercooked - the noodles raw or too chewy. The noodles themselves were actually the incorrect noodles - the noodles were glass noodles (transparent rice noodles I believe).  I don't recall having anything else other than flat rice noodles for this dish and it wasn't a pleasant experience.   The End:  We finished our \"meal\" within several minutes of receiving it and we just wanted to leave. By this time, it seems like the entire staff was avoiding us. Finally, a different, more cheerful busser came by our table to check up on us. We were in the middle of telling him why we didn't enjoy our meal and the waitress came over to check on us. When we told her about the entrees, she took them away and presented our check - removing only the two entrees we didn't touch. Really?! After making us wait for over a hour, not having the decency to apologize for the wait, or for the meal for that matter, and dropping off the check not saying anything? We were beyond annoyed at this point and just paid and left.   If you are going to try this restaurant, I would suggest going during their lunch time. The dinner crowd seems it is overwhelming for the kitchen and the staff. We were grateful for the attentive young busser at the end, but we cannot overlook the rest of the experience. I don't think I have been in a situation like this before. I have been in the restaurant business for almost ten years and there was no way it would've gotten this far for any of my guests."}
{"text":"Perfect! My husband and I were in search of a Thai restaurant near our home. After using yelp to find Gaati we were anxious to try it! We had such a good experience. The decor is beautiful and calming. The staff was so polite and helpful! Our server Francisco was great! I do not eat meat so he offered great options and they doubled my veggies!  We started with a shrimp soup that was so delicious! It was very light  and fresh with huge shrimp! I ordered the jungle curry which is a perfection option for those who do not want coconut milk. My husband ordered the pork belly and broccoli and he loved it! The broccoli was so green and fresh also.  We went during happy hour and got $2.00 beers! They also offer $4 and $5 food options and lunch specials. I never find places that make food spicy enough for me but I could tell by they authenticity our started I ordered my curry hot, not Thai hot like I usually do. Hot at Gaati IS hot! It was sooo good! The wonder came over twice to make sure everything was perfect and asked if it was our first time. We answered yes and she was so thoughtful by bringing us a free dessert of homemade ice cream. We will definitely be returning customers!"}
{"text":"My wife & I dropped in for lunch as we stumbled upon Gaati while shopping at Trader Joe's. We both had Tom Kah Gai - coconut milk chicken soup with lemongrass for a starter. My wife had the spicy mint chicken and I had red chicken curry. Having spent months in Thailand, the flavors at Gaati are authentic and I share others opinions about prices. All in all, I recommend Gaati for genuine Thai cuisine, even though it's 20% higher in price. But other Thai restaurants don't match the flavors at Gaati. We'll return for another round and let you know."}
{"text":"I will be coming back here for sure!  First time here, after reading the reviews, I was a bit skeptical and was planning to head to my favorite Siri Thai.  However, I figured I needed to go outside my comfort zone and so we tried out Gaati and overall very happy.  1.  Ambiance - Easy access, parking and location is great on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge and Eastern, near the K-Mart.  The interior decor is very well done, excellent contrast of light and dark which sets a very modern comfortable mood.  Casual or more upscale, that would be up to you.  I give the Ambiance a 5 star.  2.  Service - Ok, I must admit we came in here at 4:00 pm on a Sunday before their busy hours, so this has to be put into perspective.  The service was great, very at attentive, checking on our choices and food all times, keeping my ice water and my hot Jasmine tea always filled.  Service is 5 star.  3,  Food - Being the first time, we ordered more dishes than we could eat, to get a good taste:  Spicy - We ordered everything medium and found it to be just the right amount with a bit of a kick. I normally like ti a bit hotter, however, the wifey likes it less spicy. I found the balance of spice to be nice.  a.  Tom Yam Soup - We ordered the hot pot version of this soup with Chicken as it was listed on the menu.  Now, we learned that the menu does not say so, yet you can order this with any meat you want.  It was a bit expensive, yet light and tasty at the same time. To me, this soup is suppose to be very light and delicate and I am used to having more robust soup, so it was very nice to have it so delicate.  For those of you not use to this, it may be a different experience.  I give the soup a 4 star.  b.  Pad Kee Mau - Drunken Noodles, the stuff you eat if you are from Thailand and had a late night drink binge.  Very tasty, very nice texture of the wide / broad noodle. I rather enjoyed the taste very much. A favorite of mine. I give it a 5 star.  c.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - I order this dish at every place I go to try and compare.  Here it was a nice mix of red bell pepper, onion eggplant and ground pork.  Now, I liked this here, however, it had more of a gravy that I attribute to chinese stir fry and usually not Thai, so I was not expecting this.  I overall liked it and will give it a 4 star.  d.  Massaman Curry - I had this with Beef. I learned from the team there at Gaati that it is traditional to have it with Beef, however, they can do chicken, just takes longer to cook.  I really enjoyed it. Nice spice to it and very nice tasty chunks of beef.  Not sliced, chunks!  I give this a 4 star.  e.  Fried Rice with BBQ - Ordered this to go home for the kiddies along with all the left overs we had.  Decent portion, I paid 5.00 for extra pork portion.  So, this made it 16.00 for a nice tasting, yet small portion of fried rice.  For sure it is a must try, yet 16.00 is a bit steep for fried rice in my book. I give this a 3 star.  I will be coming back. The people here make you feel welcome, at home and are part of the great experience. Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessing over the Pad Thai! Soooo good! We have been a couple of times and I cannot get anything else, but everything new my husband has ordered has been amazing too!"}
{"text":"What can I say.......Traveled Thailand twice and have experienced several Thai restaurants in the states. This place is by far the most authentic! And the egg rolls, oh my.....The best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Thai food cuisine for the sophisticated palate. Enjoyed their green chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Their Tom Yum soup was a little on the salty side but it was good. Great ambiance, beautiful setting, food presentation, and, an overall great \"date night\" place for me and my husband. Plan on going back, but without our three year old next time! Didn't understand the need for flat screen tvs... !? They need more wait help for sure, but the server assigned to our table did his best to serve us as we needed."}
{"text":"If I could give them a negative five, I would! I'm going to leave two negative reviews indicative of my two horrible experiences. I'll start with what happened yesterday. I ordered my food at 12:55. I ONLY ORDERED ONE ORDER OF PAD THAI! I told the boy on the phone that I would bet there in thirty minutes, so let's just say 1:30. I ended up stopping at the grocery store, so I wasn't able to get there for another twenty minutes. That means they had nearly an hour to make ONE ORDER OF CHICKEN PAD THAI! That's it. It wasn't ready. On too of that, they said it's be another twenty minutes!!! Are you kidding me!?! I'll NEVER EVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. Never really busy when I've gone there.  The have a good selection of standard items."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience. Simple menu and good prices for dinner. Portions were reasonable. The beef was a bit chewy and salad a bit salty side for me,so because of those reasons I can't give 4 star. Solid Thai spot I see myself revisiting."}
{"text":"The  ambiance in this restaurant was truly lovely & portions were quite large. Unfortunately, we were unimpressed with the quality of the foods we ordered ( Pad Woon Sen & Pineapple Rice). We did enjoy the \"Treasure Bags\" appetizer. So far, Pin Kaow is still our preference for local Thai food."}
{"text":"We just finished eating take-out from Gatti. The food was so delicious. They make the best green curry, not to mention the pad kee Mao and spicy basil chicken. No other Thai restaurant even comes close to the quality and taste of Gaati. They are a real class act!"}
{"text":"Really nice Thai food. The coconut chicken soups (Tom kha gaw) Yum.   Thai tea too. Chicken Panang ok but a bit peanut buttery. Not what I'm used to."}
{"text":"Nothing at all to do with Thai food. No concept at all, zero, just a very poor meal. Fatty beef, watery curry and I asked for my food spicy with brown rice and got bland with white rice.  One positive, free Thai ice tea with orders over $50.00. it's very good, they probably bought it at Starbucks."}
{"text":"So i work a few doors down and decided to try this place out. The food was really good. I loved the spicy chicken basil.  And their linch special was only 9 dollars.  Came with soup, salad, entree with rice and an egg roll.  Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Wow, out of nowhere in a strip mall is this amazing Thai restaurant. The shrimp Tom yum soup was amazing. seriously amazing. The Tofu Pad thai was delicious too. the place was nice but not authentic feeling at all. I think they were trying to be different than every other Thai place by not making it a super Thai decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch . We ordered pad Thai comes with soup and salad. The owner or manager is so friendly and service is excellent, it was a hoale boy with good service and great personality."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here and this is my new favorite Thai restaurant. The owner was there and was very friendly and helped us select dishes for our dinner. The service was excellent! I liked how they timed our food nicely instead of some restaurants that just bring out the food as its ready.  We started with the chicken curry puffs and those were excellent. I never thought I would enjoy curry in a puff pastry but it was very crispy, flavorful and not oily. The cucumber relish went very well with the puffs. Then, we had the papaya salad which was good. For our entrees, we had Panang curry with beef, Pad See Ew and Crispy Pork Belly with Chinese broccoli. The curry was amazing and the beef was very tender. Definitely something I will order again and again. The crispy pork belly was also very tasty and will order this again too. I wasn't a fan of the Pad See Ew, but I'm not much of a fan or Thai noodle dishes.  You must try their coconut ice cream with bits of jackfruit! It was amazing! I'm drooling just thinking about it as I write this review."}
{"text":"I was thinking to go this restaurant from long time at last I did dine in last night & we didn't like their food pls don't waste your money.."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have found this place which is right down the street from my job. I stopped in during my lunch break with a craving for fried rice, but I opted for a lunch menu dish instead. They offer a $9 pre-fix menu with a decent amount of options. It includes rice, a wonton, soup and a salad. For my main meal I ordered the garlic chicken and mixed vegetables which was absolutely amazing!!! What's more, the service was fantastic, along with the ambiance of the restaurant. Definitelty give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I come here all the time because the foot is amazing. I always order the Tom Kah and my boyfriend orders the Pad Thai. Fransisco and Tristen always wait on us! Today we found that the serving size was unusually small so we said something to the restaurant and they brought us a whole new Pad Thai! They totally went out of their way for us. It was so nice. We come here about once a week and spend about $20 which is very worth it for the food we get!"}
{"text":"My go to Thai place.  The food is amazing.  Everything is made from scratch and made to order.  You may have to wait a little bit longer compared to some other places, but it is worth it!  Just a warning - the spicy is Thai spicy, so if you are not accustomed to that level of heat, order medium."}
{"text":"There are only a handful of tables full and two servers. We stood next to a family who was immediately seated and were ignored the entire time. We ended up leaving since the servers basically chose to neglect even telling us that they will get to us.   What is wrong with these servers that they cannot properly communicate to their customers upon entry. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I dashed in here for a quick lunch, not even knowing the name of the restaurant. It is very clean and pretty inside but that doesn't make up for the mediocre food, high prices and incompetent service.  I asked the waiter about a dish and he didn't know the answer, so he made it up.  I later asked for the name of the restaurant and he wasn't sure, then he tried to pronounce it, I asked him to spell it because I couldn't understand what he was saying and he misspelled it (as I found out later).  I won't go back, even in a emergency $10 for lunch is too much especially when the food is much, much better at Thai Thai just a ways down the road and lunch will cost around $6.50 they offer a 10% discount when you pay cash.  So if you love good thai food, pass on this place."}
{"text":"Pad Thai hot spicy was delicious! The place is clean and service is fast. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It is very solid great Thai restaurant ! Have great menu . We get papaya salad was great, very light great flavor, excellent ! And spicy eggplant with stomp , great, tasty!! Big portion, great value. Good wine list for Thai !!"}
{"text":"Ordered the jungle \"curry\" and got a weird tasting soup. When I called the restaurant thinking I might have gotten the wrong order, the waiter tells me that it's a healthy version of curry (which has no coconut component) and I argue that it was in the curry section hence I thought it was curry and he asked me if I even read the menu. So disappointed with our food. I actually yelped this place before I ordered. Never again!"}
{"text":"It has a casual atmosphere and a cozy dining room. Pleasant music playing over the speakers and just enough lighting during the day (lunch time) so you can relax.  The service was quick and friendly. I asked for a place to sit near an outlet to charge my phone and was quickly accommodated.  I had the yellow curry with chicken. They brought out a small salad and soup as a starter then my lunch size curry a little but later. Everything was delicious. I really liked the puff pastry that tasted like it had mashed sweet potato in it that came with the curry.  I definitely recommend this restaurant for a quick, relaxing and enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"I have spent several months in Thailand. I love Thai food and eat it often. While I wouldn't say the food here tastes just like it does over there, this has definitely become my favorite new Thai restaurant. I've been here at least 5 or 6 times now and every time has been really good.   They do a really nice som tam (papaya salad) and their tom yum kai soup is good as well. I also recommend the jungle curry and their spicy basil is top notch! The only thing I've tried that I didn't think much of was their chicken satay. It was just kind of dry and flavorless, but everything else has been great! Good desserts as well and I'm not usually a dessert person. Also, if you order Thai iced tea, they will bring you a little cup of simple syrup so that you can sweeten it to your liking, which I really appreciate since I don't like it too sweet.   Service has always been great, but unfortunately they're always slow when I've gone in. Please come support this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food with great flavor! Love the atmosphere in there. Great service, will be a repeat customer.  Pad kee mao was so good!!! Same with Tom kha soup!"}
{"text":"I have gotten the musamon curry as take out two times  and it's amazing . SOMEDAY we'll eat here !!"}
{"text":"This place has really good thai food. I have been here numerous times already and I have yet to leave without a smile on my face. They cater the heat of the menu item to your liking and there is no bar so it is a nice, quiet setting. Staff is attentive and couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"I am addicted to good Thai food, so while having a conversation about the subject a friend of mine suggested Gaati and their delicious menu. After lounging around all day yesterday, my girl and I decided to go for a nice/casual dinner so we arrived at Gatti at about 5pm. Tucked away next to Kmart, this place was nicely decorated, played relaxing music and the service was immediate and courteous. We were offered wine and presented with the menu for the evening which contained typical dishes along with some house specialties...and they all sounded amazing.  We started out with the Gaati rolls, which came with a delicate and flavorful pork stuffing and a homemade pineapple/citrus dipping sauce. We have never had such meaty rolls and complementary dip... they were the perfect start to our meal.  For our meal we ordered the pineapple chicken and the masaman curry, both accompanied with basmati rice. Both dishes were incredibly fresh and had delicate flavors that were expertly combined for our enjoyment. The portions were about right, maybe a bit small, but the flavor and service made the experience an enjoyable one.  The owner (or the person in charge) checked in with us often and was happy to suggest different dishes. When we let her know it was our first time at the restaurant, she brought out a coconut ice cream for us to try... What a nice treat! Thank you guys very much for a great evening."}
{"text":"I don't like HOT Thai food but I like it with a touch of heat, so maybe I ordered too plain.. I ordered a 1 if I go again I will order a 2.  Pad Thai good, Tom Ka Gai good but kinda on the \"chunky\" side, BBQ pork rice good and the Beef and Broccoli, the gravy is too thick."}
{"text":"We came here one evening and we were the only ones there.  It was dead but at least the servers gave us more attention. lol,   Im giving this four stars because they won me over with their thai iced tea! I have been picky with ordering thai tea and trying gaati's thai iced thai was incredible.  Instead of having the cream they have you a sugary syrup and you can put how much you want in you tea.  I loved it.    I dont really remembered what I ordered I think it was pineapple chicken. And once they were putting it down on our table. WHOA the aroma of it was crazy.  It woke me up and it was strong aroma of whatever sauce it had.  It was very yummy.    The prices were kinda high but I wouldnt mind coming back here since its just down the street."}
{"text":"It was another Sunday where I barely felt like moving off of my bed let alone going somewhere to pick up some food (making it about the 30th Sunday so far this year).  Didn't really feel like pizza and around these parts if you don't want pizza the options are limited.  Decided to try Gaati for the first time even though it required me to pick up the phone and dial a number which was a struggle in itself.  Took me about 10 minutes it felt like to explain my street address because it contains roughly 12 words in it which is another issue altogether, but the food was on it's way and showed up 45 minutes later as promised.  I really wished I liked it more, but ultimately I found it fairly run of the mill thai food.  I tried the Basil Fried Rice with Tofu because fried rice always sounds delicious, the pictures on this site looked good, and I chose Tofu because I wanted to limit my weight gain over the weekend to a respectable 9.75 lbs instead of 10.  I ordered it a spice level 3 out of 4, which is a pet peeve of mine to not offer more variety of spice levels.  I found this dish to be pretty bland and underseasoned, and it didn't seem spicy to me in the least.  Another minus for me which would probably be a plus to any reasonable human being was that it wasn't greasy at all.  It almost seemed healthy in a sense but on this night I would have preferred a little bit more oil to it for some more flavor.  I ordered the tofu to make me feel less guilty about the grease that would be dribbling down my chin while eating it and didn't get that.  2/5 because it wasn't inedible  I also tried the Pork Mee Kao which I saw someone mention was drunken noodles in one of the reviews here.  I've had drunken noodles at Lotus which I consider to be one of the top 78 things I've ever eaten so I figured I'd give them a go here, also a 3/4 spice level.   As not spicy as the Fried Rice was, this was the complete opposite and was burning my entire mouth with every bite and I literally still felt the pure heat in my mouth hours later as I reveled in the new Breaking Bad episode.  Even though it was spicier than I would have wanted when ordering a 3/4, it was still a very tasty dish and the pork and veggies seemed fresh and of good quality.   It was nowhere near as good as the Lotus of Siam version (if they are indeed the same thing), but I would eat it again for sure (next time a 2/4, which will probably not have any spice whatsoever.   see why I hate this scale?)  4/5 on this one  Both of these dishes were $11 and I ordered an iced tea which was probably $3 or so, and my total when delivered was $30.50 which was a little more than I expected.   To be fair their menu says it's a delivery surcharge based on distance up to $7 and it looks like I probably paid $4-$5 which isn't too bad, but you might want to check with them when you call in to double check as I was left with only $3.50 to tip the delivery driver in cash instead of my standard $5.   Not surprisingly I thought the noodles was worth the price and the fried rice not.     So yeah, after all that, 3/5 and you're probably no better off than when you clicked this.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food always tastes fresh....quality!!! If you choose to dine it, it's a quaint little place, almost feels like a family dining experience... Looks like a house inside. One of my favorite things, is they have call ahead ordering to go or delivery. The staff is very nice! Try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner here and the experience was pretty pleasant. I've been passing this restaurant for some time now but with Thai Thai just down the street, I've never popped in to check it out until now. What I loved most about this place was the ambiance. It's very clean and quaint. It's not what you would expect compared to other restaurants that hardly have decor, or you'd rather order take out than to sit down. My husband ordered the Panang curry with chicken. It wasn't anything spectacular but it was still pretty good (wasn't a fan of the peas), plenty of chicken. I ordered the crispy rice salad and I would not recommend it. It tasted like I was eating rice crispy cereal. Only good part was the dressing they give you on the side. I ate maybe a quarter of it and boxed up the rest. Best parts of the dinner was their Thai tea (they give you simple syrup on the side to sweeten yourself) and the mango and sticky rice for dessert (can't really go wrong with this dish). Service was excellent. Very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Refilled water any chance they had. It's not exactly the place I'd go when I'm really craving Thai food. But I'd probably go back because it's so near me and I want to check out the happy hour. Happy Hour: tues-fri from 3-6pm. $2 beers and $4-5 bite size dishes."}
{"text":"I read on yelp beforehand that the Pad Thai here was quite oily but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and ordered Pad Thai for take out anyway. I should've heeded the warnings!! Unfortunately, the noodles were drenched in oil and I had to try very hard to find the scamp pieces of chicken. The flavor itself was a bit bland as well. The restaurant interior was decorated nicely but I don't think the decor could save it from the less than mediocre food.   I don't really understand why this place has 4 stars since I paid $11 for Pad Thai that had both underwhelming portions and flavor."}
{"text":"How are you people saying anything good about this place? I'm in shock! This happens to be THE WORST Thai food I've ever eaten!! Omg the green curry was flavorless and the consistency of water. The tom yum soup was bland and too sour. I also ordered chicken satay, bad idea, how can you mess up chicken satay? The peanut sauce was terrible. I also ordered the pumpkin custard, nasty.... It doesnt take like pumpkin at all and over cooked. The only thing that was good was the young coconut because they didn't touch it. Everything I ordered was really small, it only took a few minutes to eat. $52!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the F!!!   So expensive! I could of heated a bowl of water in the microwave and ate that for dinner, it be a lot cheaper and would somehow tasted better. Don't waste your money. Go to sakun or Thai house were they know how to cook Thai food!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food. I have had way better Thai food for way cheaper prices. Maybe because i'm a huge Thai food fan and have tired many Thai Restaurants. The basil fried rice lacked flavor and was dry. This place seems slow, well at least when i went in it was. The chicken and beef tasted a little funny."}
{"text":"We had the Tom yum, papaya salad, pad Thai and ice creams, it was delicious, the staff is very friendly.  Very nice atmosphere! It's good to have a Thai place near me."}
{"text":"First visit -definitely not our last. We had take out. Great service. Green curry and BBQ fried rice were great."}
{"text":"There has been a change of ownership at Gaati Thai.  Cooks are different, and the woman who was always present out front is gone.  However, the younger guy who seemed to be an assistant waiter is still there, and now appears to be the lead waiter.  Thankfully, the food is still very good.  They's had a few minor tweaks to the menu, but most of the favorites are still there.  My only criticism is that, IMO, they've ruined the ambiance of their tasteful dining room by installing two large TV monitors in corners of the room."}
{"text":"Ordered the soup here and it was soooo good! Also when we finally went into the restaurant the establishment was beautifully decorated and clean! Super cute atmosphere. Also the women that helped me I believe she was the owner was extremely pleasant and nice. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I did order delivery!! The delivery time was 20 min earlier than expected which was great!! I was also very surprised by the fact that I was able to place the order within the yelp app!! Aside from those two facts! The food was delicious! The white rice was so aromatic, sticky and well cooked! The only thing that had me mark this place 4 instead of 5 stars was the sauce the dumplings came with. It did not agree with the flavor of the dumplings! The dumplings were soft! Crispy and full of their own flavor, so they were enjoyable on their own. The curry was amazing! The consistency was perfect! No flavor overpowered any other flavor. I am very satisfied with the food! And I shall return once I'm done trying all the cuisine in the area!"}
{"text":"Summary:   I wanted to be, but I am not in love. I had high hopes, but I feel they were a bit dashed. As for authenticity? I don't know, I am not in the kitchen when they prepare things (though some of the other reviews make me wonder if *they* are... interpret as you wish).  Slightly longer version:  I stopped in here with high expectations. I ordered three items to go and used the Yelp check-in special for 10% off my order.  -- Curry puffs  A little overcooked but, by far, the star of the show. 7 or 8 large, flavorful, puffs with cucumber relish (more like a cucumber salad, if we're going to be accurate).   I really liked that they were snap-crispy on the outside and slightly over-browned. Personal preference? Not usually, as some was a little more than over-browned. BUT, against the soft, tender, flavorful filling? It was perfect. It had to be an accident as no one would cook these to the point of almost burnt in some spots, but it somehow worked here.  -- Chicken Tom Kha (soup)  I am at a loss. The flavors were really good and the heat was perfect. The chicken and mushrooms were tender. But the texture of the soup itself was... the only way to describe it was that there is either a powdered component that wasn't properly mixed in or, worse, something curdled? It had a grainy, thick, unmixed feel and look to it.  Now, you may point out that this was take out. However, I have had Thai soups delivered or taken home from much greater distances. I considered that and after much hoping, realized it was, in fact, the soup.   :(  -- Panang with Tofu (curry)  Unfortunately, I didn't get panang with tofu as much as I got tofu with a little panang. Not nearly enough curry for what they charge and not at all what I was expecting. The curry was more like a sauce for the tofu instead of being the main dish I ordered. The flavors, like the soup, were great. A little less on the herbs, a lot less on the tofu, and more - please! - of the panang. The heat was not spot on like the soup, but it was close.  Damn! I really was excited about this place, too!  Overall, a lackluster experience. The stars definitely come from the flavors and the puffs... but there are enough \"oh, no....\" moments to make me sad about it.  To be absolutely fair, I will be going back and dining in, taking a person or people with me who also love Thai food. I want so badly for this to be a good place, but based on this one meal? It's a cross between Meh, I have had better and A-OK. I will err on the positive and see what happens next time."}
{"text":"Waiting: I came in around 6:30pm on a Thursday night. There were a few tables full and we were seating right away.  Food (Vegan): I ordered the spring roll appetizers, the pad thai without eggs, and the yellow curry with tofu. Loved the crunchy spring rolls and the sauce is delicious. Probably my favorite curry out of all the thai places I've tried. Spicy scale here is 1-4 and I ordered a 1. Enough to taste the spice, but not too spicy to overwhelm the hint of sweetness. The pad thai was also good, but I still have yet to find one that I love.  Service: Waiters were very friendly and always available when we needed them. Very fast to get us what we need.  Yummy, convenient, recommend trying, would come again."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Gaati and I must say I am just as impressed with the staff as I am the food. I ordered the Jungle Curry and the staff member was so personable and ensured I understood what I was ordering and even asked me what my preferences were as far as spice and taste. I felt as if he genuinely cared about my satisfaction. I will DEFINITELY be a returning customer. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I'm a little lost at where to begin.. The good or the bad.  I ordered delivery and the guy who answered the phone was far past stupid. I ask for a delivery order and he says \"is this for Nevada?\" Then after having to repeat everything 3 times he asks \"can you pay cash? I don't get the credit thing\".   The delivery driver was a very nice young man, and arrived way before the quoted time.  The food is pretty tasty but really only 2 shrimp in the Mango salad w shrimp?  The volcano chicken was great.  All in all not bad but get rid of the idiot working the phone.  I would have rated higher but good lord that man was a moron."}
{"text":"A new Thai restaurant close to home!  I just had Pin Kaow last night so when I noticed this new place near my great dentist, I thought a taste comparison was in order. This place smells fresh and new. Contemporary decor, soft Thai music playing, friendly wait staff. Apparently, the owners have owned and sold other Thai restaurants around town.  I ordered the Chicken Laab salad and the Som Tum with Grilled Shrimp. Both were excellent, and I definitely preferred their green papaya salad to the one served at Pin Kaow.  They have a Prix Fixe Lunch menu AND they deliver!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good take out tried the pad thai. Classic that was done well. Slightly on the dry side."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are here probably once a week. The food is yummy, the service is fast, and the dining room is small and cozy. There are never more than a few other parties and it's always pretty quiet. The music is always pretty pleasant.  I like their crab rangoons, nice filling to crispy wrapper ratio. Spicy veggie pad Thai is a must have every time.  This would be a solid five star review, however, during a visit once our appetizer order of Treasure Bags came with 2.5 out of 4 of them burned from the bottom into the yummy filling. Instead of taking the plate and returning with a fresh and properly goldened order, they took two and replaced only two leaving us with one that would be considered \"well\" and the other \"extra super well/verge of burned.\" Also, I'm a fan of the \"1-10\" spice scale versus the \"mild, medium, hot, Thai hot\" scale... so I would change that too."}
{"text":"Nice decent place. Music played Hard Rock which does not match the clientele. Two TVs were ON but no sound. Food is excellent, the Catfish was deboned and Spicy basil chicken although too sweet was good; but the white rice could be warmer not seemingly cold. The server was kind to suggest next time to ask for AMERICAN or THAI authentic styles.   The charged additional Extra rice contrary to what the other server mentioned. The other Thai Restaurant on Eastern Ave do not. Guess we'll be going there more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is super clean and very good food. The presentation is everything and the prices on food are amazing. Great great Thai food."}
{"text":"Been coming here four about three years now and just realized I never wrote a Yelp review for this place. The customer service is always attentive and it's never to crowded which is nice. The appetizers are really nice. I like the curry puffs. And for dinner I recommend the red curry.  Really good place and the Thai tea is good to. Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes Thai food or anyone looking to try some good  Thai food."}
{"text":"Really good place for take out Thai food. Our go to place is Thai house but gaati Thai is a contender. I tried their veggie medley with tofu and their fish cake salad  (forgot the actual name). Both were really good. These were two new dishes for me but you can't go wrong with stir fry veggies and tofu w/ brown rice. The veggies were perfectly cooked (cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, tomatoes, and broccoli) and the tofu (firm) was nicely marinated and slightly fried. I got the dish a medium spice level but it wasn't hot at all so I had to add garlic chili sauce to it when I got home. The fish cake salad was new for me so I didn't know what to expect from a fish cake. The texture is kinda different but it was ok for me. The salad came in a crispy taco shell like bowl full of lettuce, bell peppers and cucumbers with a side of vinegarette dressing that was yummy but it was super thick like a chutney so it was more of a dipping sauce than dressing. The staff is super nice and the decor is pleasant and good for a date night out. I'll definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Food always excellent. Nice inside. Have never heard \"rap\" music. Don't listen to bad reviews, go see for yourself. We love this place and order at least twice a month."}
{"text":"We were huge Archi 's Thai fans but whoa this place is pretty fantastic and at lunch you hardly have anyone there.   Favs: Basil Thai with pork (wish it were ground instead of sliced), jungle curry chicken, Pad Thai chicken, the salmon is awesome, sea bass is equally awesome and I could eat a ton of the crab fried rice!"}
{"text":"Gaati has a solid 4 star review on Yelp, it should be 4.5-5. Seems many of the complaints come from reviews on dishes that are Americanized or Chinese in nature... Here's my tip... Don't order those!!!   My mom and I came here on an early Friday night, I enjoyed the interior, it was not as \"gallery-esque\" as many of the other reviews stated. In my opinion, it is simple, clean, & modern. Nothing wrong with that!! It was although smaller than I had expected, but this makes for quiet, quick, attendant service.   For the food:  - appetizer: Papaya salad. Very yummy and perfect for summertime. It's cool and crisp with chilled shrimp on top, and thin cabbage leaves to make a wrap if you desire. Everywhere else that I've had this dish (including my grandma's) is way too spicy, even when ordered mild, this dish on the other hand could have actually used more spice... So for next time I know! If you've never had papaya salad, and are unfamiliar with fish sauce, this will be entirely new for you!   -entree: Green curry with chicken. I was SO pleased with this dish. I know how I want my green curry, and this was perfect! It was creamy with the perfect amount of heat. Perfect balance of bamboo shoots and Thai basil, yum! Plus, what I find lacking in many curry dishes is the quality of the chicken... This chicken was memorable, tender and cut into strips, whereas other restaurants seem to make the chicken a weak accessory to the dish. They have green peas in this, which is new to me... but they were rare, so I didn't mind, haha. Also, they don't skip out on the rice here, hallelujah!!!!   My mom got yellow curry and enjoyed it very much and kept saying, \"mmm, just like mom's!\" Neither of us finished and were able to take home a generous amount of leftovers while also leaving quite satisfied!   Another thing I should remark on is the price, I don't feel it is over priced, it is pretty standard especially for the quality and location. The two of us dined for $44 with two specialty drinks, an appetizer, & two entrees... Not bad, not bad at all!   So try out a little, hidden, Henderson gem for some satisfying Thai food. I may be their new regular!"}
{"text":"Okay here we go on this review. The Green Curry made in Medium was awesome and GREAT tasting. The only thing is the menu reads Fresh bird eye chili paste, bamboo shoots, basil, coconut milk and a choice of your meat chicken beef or pork.  When I got home as I ordered this to go. The container had Zucchini with red and green bell peppers which was not stated. Good thing I am not allergic to those vegetables as they should disclosed this on there discription in there menu.  Green Curry was yummy. I don't know if you eat in they give you a better portion size because the container was just enough for one person and I don't eat much. I will go back and eat in the next time and try the green curry again to see if the consistantcy of quality is just as good when I just had it.  I will try to give other menu items a try to and will see if other  friends would like to try this place with me as a sit down meal.  From going in the Restruant the ambiance was very inviting and clean and nice and bright color decor.  Restruant looks well kept and clean and nice table room not cluttered and close to the next person.  Friendly staff was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to pick up and what a cute little restaurant, definitely not busy during the time I came but it was a super clean facility. Not many places have it, it's not even a hole in the wall, there was more tables and I love how the kitchen doesn't even look like a kitchen! The gentleman that helped me was nice as well as the other ones that were serving food. I think I will come back and dine in! But the food is superb! Wonton soup isn't too salty and definitely not bland, just right! And the fried rice is amazing with tofu with a medium kick to it! I gotta say this might be my new favorite Thai place!"}
{"text":"\"My husband has a pretty high tolerance for spice but went with their \"medium\" spicy. To test out our first order. It was way hotter than it should have been. He normally gets the \"Thai Spicy\" from Pinkaow, which is just above their 10 level but said Gaatis medium was just as hot if not hotter. For a medium spice level, it was way too hot.\"  Pinkaow actually underspices in my opinion. They are scared you will send it back because it will be too spicy. In fact no matter how many times I have asked them for thai spicy they always give me medium.   And yes you are correct, Thai Spicy at Gaati is very spicy, but very good."}
{"text":"I came to this spot with a friend for the 1st time about 2 months ago. We were the only 2 people in the restaurant. Made me a little nervous. Started out with a small chicken tom yum soup and an Asahi beer. Happy hour special so the beer was only $2.50! Then my entree. Yellow chicken curry (med). I was pleasantly surprised! The service was really good! Attentive and accommodating! The food was exceptionally awesome! Since that 1st visit I am now a loyal customer! The best part is that it's right down the street from my house! I'm all about this spot!!"}
{"text":"The dining room is lovely.  The service at first was way too slow.  Once they picked up, it was much better.  The drinks were always warm or hot.  Hot beer and hot San Pellegrino is yuck.  Food was OK.  I asked for the hottest and the spice was good."}
{"text":"I'm glad I came to try this place with my friend tonight, the waitress is very friendly and sweet, the mango salad and pineapple fried rice and the mango sticky rice are the best!! I will be back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food when I went and picked it up myself... however, when I used Grubhub to order for six people including children for dinner tonight, they repeatedly lied to me: first, the driver is here and about to walk out the door (15min after they were supposed to be here) ten minutes later (the restaurant is less than a mile away) they're walking out the door now, I told them they needed to be here in five minutes; twenty minutes later, no show. Called Grubhub and restaurant simultaneously and both put us on hold to get their stories straight; the \"manager\" shows up with the food while on hold (shocker), restaurant says they called me five times, manager shows up with wrong number called twice AFTER both of my calls, and more lip service... now I have no dinner and need to wait five business days for a refund... shame on you. Lie about using grubhub, then use your own employees to upcharge, then don't show up. Male answering the phone told me \"I'm busy right now,\" and didn't want to be bothered with our calls... wonderful. We have hungry kids. Thanks a lot. Steer clear unless you want to pick your own food up. These people are dishonest and now I wait more than a week for my refund. Shame on you guys."}
{"text":"Was out running around and had a craving for Thai food. As always I went to my Yelp app to see what was around. Gaati came right up and was only .2 miles away so off we went.   Kayba greeted us as soon as walked in. We told her it was our first time there so she gave us two menus to look at the lunch specials. She answered several questions for us and explained the dishes.   The lunch special is $9 which includes salad with ginger dressing, tom yum soup, a curry puff and main course. You can choose from beef, chicken, vegetable or tofu and then what type of entree you want. There were many options: Pad thai, mongolian, sweet & sour, panang, green curry, yellow and red curry.   We chose the chicken pad thai and chicken yellow curry. Kayba brought out our salad and soup which I thought were very good. The salad was a little sparse with just some lettuce and carrots but the ginger dressing was great.   Shortly after our entrees arrived. I am not a Thai food expert but I really enjoyed my pad thai, the sauce was delicious. Kayba came by to make sure we liked everything and to refill our drinks. She was very friendly and helpful to first timers.   I thought the food and service were great, and for $9 we were full and happy."}
{"text":"Delivery man was very nice. Easy ordering over the phone the woman repeated everything back for us.  The food tasted homemade and not greasy like typical Thai restaurants around here. I'm not much on fried rice but my husbands BBQ fried rice was amazingly addictive. They would've gotten five stars if we got fortune cookies ;) I don't think this is that sorta place! Def our new spot"}
{"text":"Go there! Wonderful food and service, authentic Thai food and very reasonable prices. I was lucky enough to wander in while in town visiting friends. If you like Thai, go. Enough said."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for the first time just now and found the food to be flavorful and good. We eat Thai allot and I like this place. We had the treasures for an appetizer, the yellow curry with chicken and the cashew chicken for entree's and everything was good including the free scoop of ice cream we were offered at the end of the meal along with the service."}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday it wasn't too busy ordered yellow curry and volcano chicken it was delicious!! Must try !! Also the Thai teas have a great flavor to them."}
