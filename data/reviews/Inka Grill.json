{"text":"The fried calamari was presented well and not just rings. It had a light citrus sauce with onions on top which went together great. 4/5

The sea bass ceviche was a bit spicy for one of our guests but I enjoyed it and there was no fishy taste at all. 3/5

The saltado de pollo (chicken with veggies and rice) was okay. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be served on top of fries or that is an American addition. The fries get soggy from the sauce so it's best to eat those soon. 3/5

The chicken dish above was served with spaghetti and I mentioned it was supposed to be served with rice. The waitress attempted to argue with me until I pointed at the menu specifying white rice not pasta. I'm not sure whose mistake it was but I merely pointed at the item instead of attempting to pronounce it. 

We also ordered the Alfajores (corn starch dessert) which were tasty and hard to stop eating. 4/5

I think it's worth a try and would probably go back for more."}
{"text":"Why u have such low reviews, Inka Grill?  Food was AWESOME!  I caught this place on a drive by and saw a plate of Lomo Saltado on the window so I stopped in...I haven't had a plate of it in years, and it's one of my favorite South American dishes...it was FANTASTIC.  I didn't have the appetite to try anything else, but I'd go back for the Saltado anytime.  The green salsas (forget the name) are perfectly fiery and great.  They even serve the toasted corn kernels making it all very authentic. A bit on the pricey side is my only complaint."}
{"text":"The food is amazing my girlfriend and i come a few times a week, she's Peruvian and knows her food. You cannot go with with any dish hands down the best ceviche I've ever had. The owner is an absolute sweetheart, I highly recommend Inka."}
{"text":"Upon ordering, everything we requested from the menu was somehow not available.  Maybe an issue with ordering supplies? Our group indulged in some ceviche, a meaty combo and some fish.  What we did eat was tasty with some good spice (heat)."}
{"text":"Food was really great actually! Had tallerin verde with steak and lomo saltado!! Waitress (Veronica) was very nice and attentive. Both service and food was excellent. And bathroom was clean and the restaurant itself was very clean."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Do not go there. They only have one waitress at all times. They make you wait to long to serve food. There is no room for big parties. They turn people away because they are too lazy to stay open a little after closing. The food is not prepared authentic Peruvian. They need to hire more staff, improve the quality and authenticity of the food. But, most of all improve in their customer service. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I decided on this place as a last minute change of plans. They had been there before but I was a \"noob\" to the restaurant as well as Peruvian food in general.

The restaurant atmosphere is somewhat inviting, lightly dimmed, warm colors with murals on the wall. There were about 4 or 5 other people dining so it wasn't really busy. We were seated promptly and after the waitress took our drink orders, we all decided on 3 orders of Lomo Saltado and an appetizer order of the Papa Rellena.

The first thing to come out was supposed to be the Papa Rellena, but that wasn't what showed up on our table... instead it was an order of Papa a la Huancaina. Now, normally I would complain about the waitress getting it wrong, but after being corrected, she apologized quickly and got us the right appetizer while comping the incorrect one. So one star for fixing that mistake with urgency and sincerity.

Here's the odd part... my friend clearly said THREE orders of the Lomo Saltado. During our appetizer round, one order of Lomo Saltado came out. It was weird that the waitress brought out just one but we figured ours would come shortly following that. After finishing both appetizers, there was still only one order of Lomo Saltado on the table. When we asked her about the other orders, she emphatically stated, \"No you only ordered ONE Lomo Saltado.\" Ok, if we're asking about the other two, how can you emphasize one?! As bewilderment and frustration slowly showed on our faces, the waitress apologized and put in the other two orders.

I will say this... although the service was not up to par, the food was delicious. The Papa Rellena was some kind of beef stuffed potato loaded with savory spices. Mix that with salsa on the side... perfection! Even our free appetizer was delicious, potatoes in a cream sauce that left a little spicy zing aftertaste. I enjoyed the Lomo Saltado as well. Imagine a saute of red onions, steak and tomatoes in a soy sauce/cilantro sauce with french fries at the bottom.. DELISH! Served with a side a rice, this meal was complete! 

Now this is my first time trying Peruvian food and I could be wrong about how good it was, but I know my taste buds always do a good job of not lying to me. Now if only the service would improve, I'd be a die hard fan. Right now, this place will have to settle for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Inka grill is amazing, scrumptious tasting food, their ceviche is out of this world, and the staff are very friendly and perform excellent customer service. Id highly recommend Inka Grill to anyone looking for high quality tasting food, cozy atmosphere and the excellent customer service you deserve!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty small place with 6 TVs to take your dining experience away and pop music blasting in there.
 They have a little bit of an identity crisis... they can't make up their mind on whether they serve Peruvian or Chinese, seriously! They even give you fortune cookies with your bill lol
Their prices for lunch are the same as for dinner.
 Server was OK but it wouldn't hurt her if she'd smile once in a while even if it is in a fake-wanna get a good tip kind of way!"}
{"text":"Very good pollo a la brasa. Has a pretty nice selection. It is more of a to go or pick up place. Because of this the prices are the most affordable in the market."}
{"text":"I've tried to eat here before, but never saw an employee.  I was the only person in the restaurant.  I left after 10 minutes of not seeing anyone.  The pictures of their food are quite enticing, so I thought I would try again a few months later.  As we walked in, the first thing that hit us was the blaring hip-hop music from a radio station  with weak reception, mostly all static.  We were greeted and sat with menus but no drink orders.  We waited another 10 minutes before we had our drink order taken.  Waited another 15 minutes before our lunch order was taken.  Their specialty is a Peruvian spiced chicken, but were told the chicken might not be ready yet. After checking, it was ready.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken, which came out almost immediately.  I never saw my dish.  When asked if my dish was coming, we were told her chicken was done, so it was brought out first.  After waiting another 15 minutes of waiting for my dish (Remember, this is my lunch break), they took her dish to put in the oven to keep it warm (we wondered if they took the salad off the plate first).  another 10 minutes passed and after wondering where our server and food were, we left a $5.00 on the table for the drinks and left."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas quite a few times in the past year & I just had to write a review because this place is amazing!!!!!! I've been to Peru over 30 times and I've been to all the Peruvian restaurants in NJ, NY, etc...even the ones in Miami, Chicago, and Long Beach. Inka Grill is the best place in the US, period!!! The ingredients are top notch, the food is always fresh, and the flavor is 100% authentic. They have items that hardly any other Peruvian restaurant in the US can make properly. 

As an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the Chicharron de Calamari o Yuca a la Huancaina. For a drink, you have to try the Pisco Sour. It is much, much better than the ones you get at Sushi Samba or Tanta (even better than all the Lettuce Entertainment places like Nacional 27 in Chicago). As for food, wow!!!! I've been here at least 10 times and the ceviche is amazing and served authentically, the lomo saltado is so flavorful and perfect, the tallarin verde is always juicy, flavorful, and reminds me of how my mom used to make it. 

As for dessert, you have to try the picarones!!!! No restaurant in the US can make them perfectly but Inka Grill can!!! Also, try the lucuma ice cream. Lucuma is a fruit that only grows in Peru and has a unique/distinct flavor. Not many restaurants serve these wonderful and unique treats!!!!

You have to try this place when you are in Las Vegas ....it is truly amazing and something extremely unique."}
{"text":"I adore this place. So cheap and delicious!  Service really fast and friendly. Chicken is so flavorful and moist."}
{"text":"Hmm.  Don't know anything about Peruvian food but it was just okay.  Had fried yucca, which was pretty good, also a slow cooked beef called Seco, and a shrimp dish.  We'll give it a second try but it was a little disappointing.  The place bills itself as Peruvian-Chinese but there were only a few items that were actually fusion dishes and the one I tried, a fried rice, was passable but nothing special."}
{"text":"I never   Before  tested the  peruvian  food  is   Very  good  i love  the   Ceviche   ,   The  snavk  are  very  testeful  and    The  place   Is  cool  a little  small  but   Nice    The  next  time  i will   Try  the  lomo  saltado   I can  wait !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! Clean and quaint. I had the saltado de pollo y los plantanos fritos. Fresh and delicious! The maracuya o chicha morado was also very good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The lomo saltado is delicious , the other food is just so so. The service not very good, there's only three people up front. The place is very small and the parking is atrocious . My daughter got her new car keyed. So until something changes soon we will not be going for a while."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are both picky eaters and very picky when it comes to service.  I have to admit that I had my doubts about this place before we stepped through the door.  Inside the decor is simple and easy on the eyes. About 6 TVs around the walls, that might seem extreme but while eating the whole atmosphere felt like home to me.  The waitress Gail had a pleasant upbeat attitude and a genuine passion for the food and the culture even though she wasn't Peruvian. Now the food was incredible, me and my wife both had Seco de Carne which is slow cooked beef with Peruvian beans and rice.  Very delicious and a definite favorite for me and my wife.  We will continue to dine at this restaurant to try new foods and flavors. I am very glad we visited this place as it is a new favorite for us and I do recommend Inka Grill."}
{"text":"I'm always looking to try new restaurants and different types of foods so this place was a nice new twist. I enjoyed the food and it seemed to be pretty authentic Peruvian food. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"We were feeling adventurous and decided to try Inka Grill. I'm vegetarian so I was skeptical as to what Peruvian food I could eat. We ordered the Passion Fruit drink and the purple corn drink (the exact name escapes me). Both were delicious!  For an appetizer we couldn't decide between the boiled potato or the yucca. They were kind enough to give us a little of each. We had never had yucca and were pleasantly surprised. I had the linguine with pesto sauce and it was more tasty than the one I had at an Italian place last week. My hubby had a grilled chicken breast dish with rice and veggies. I can vouch for the rice and veggies being tasty. He said the chicken had good flavor.  We would come back here...although I will need to be in the mood for pasta, since that's the basic nod to vegetarian entrees.

Some reviews indicated concern for service. There is one person serving all the tables. She was very pleasant and helped explain the menu since this was our first visit. As we were leaving, several tables filled and she quickly greeted them and started their service."}
{"text":"Came in with my colleagues after seeing the advertisement of rotisserie chicken. Sat down and was greeted by the owner who gave us her recommendations and in depth explanation of what everything was. Inka Grill has found itself a customer for life. Food, Pricing and staff is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Yaning was great!!  She personally made my Anaconda drink which was a little strong but amazeballs. Tallarin Saltado de pollo was very tasty. This place has turned into our Sunday brunch location! Always get the pitcher of guava punch."}
{"text":"The Inka Grill replaced Little Dumpling a few months ago, and is more of a disappointment than an improvement. The chef/owners of Little Dumpling were very flexible in creating tasty vegetarian renditions of nearly any Peruvian or Peruvian-Chinese (Chaufa) dish on the menu. On my only visit to Inka Grill, the waitress simply pointed out the very limited vegetarian options on the menu. This may have been because there was no cook in the kitchen and she was getting nervous about the possibility of having to prepare our meal herself, but I will get back to that in a minute.

I settled on the fried yuca a la Huancaina (as a vegetarian, I was left with two options: yuca or potato?) and my husband ordered the ceviche de pescado. We also ordered a pitcher of chicha morada. We were served a carafe, containing just enough for one glass each. I've never seen that before. The flavorful Huancaina sauce was great, but the yuquitas had bit of an off-flavor, possibly from the frying oil. My husband's fish ceviche was good, but he prefers the ceviche at Mi Peru. The waitress returned to the table and seemed relieved that we were pleased with our food. \"The chef was late, so I started cooking until he arrived. I just thought, ceviche, it can't be that hard!\" I laughed at her honesty, but found this horrifying and unprofessional (if the cook abandons the kitchen, close the restaurant!), and we opted to skip on entrees. I would have tried the picarones from the dessert menu, but they were not available. Typical.

Other changes that have been made under the new ownership include dimmer lighting, fancier (smaller) dinner plates, MORE flat screen TVs lighting up the walls, white table cloths covered with paper, irritating top 40 radio station, and higher menu prices. They really haven't fixed the place up that nicely; I can still see the very casual, best for takeout place that it used to be as the Little Dumpling. It's still not the kind of place you would take someone on a date, though I feel like they want it to be. I can name a Peruvian restaurant that underwent a similiar \"transformation\": Che Inka Chicken/Grill recently went out of business. Even though the food was not bad, the experience can't be awarded more than 2 very disappointed stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a fantastic price...what more could you ask for! This is a diamond in the rough. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but it is definitely worth venturing inside! My husband and I came here for lunch one afternoon. We were able to be seated right away, and our waitress was extremely pleasant and helpful when ordering.  She brought out roasted corn and a delicoius cilantro salsa. I could have just eaten that and been happy! We ordered and our food was brought out a short time later. Everything was delicious and so fresh.  We will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Lomo Saltado  was very good & satisfying!!! Me, my husband & my son ordered extra rice ( pricy though for 1 scoop rice  $2.99 ) but the meat is so tender & flavorful. Overall, good food but the place needs an upgrade for their price..."}
{"text":"Wonderful Peruvian food! I definitely recommend the Lomo Soltado and Papas de Hauncina. I hope it does well, because it's authentic. The wait staff is friendly and helpful! Our Peruvian family all gives it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Found this place incidentally - My friends and I went next door to the poke place but wanted \"real food\" instead so we came here haha! At 2pm on  Sunday, there were no customers so I was a bit hesitant but we were hungry and I like Peruvian food.

Our waitress brought out fried corn (like corn nuts) with some green avocado/guacamole - like cream sauce. Great and unique appetizer that we asked for more :)

I ordered the 1/4 chicken plate that came with fries and a salad. I actually asked for rice instead of the fries but I guess the chef forgot. My waitress gave me a side of rice for no extra charge :)

Ceviche: I think there were TOO many onions but definitely an appetizer to order. Large portion and the flavor is good if you like lime! 

Lomo saltado: Marinated strips of beef stir fried with tomatoes, onions and FRIES and served wit rice. Very good! My friend thought it was salty, but I didn't think so.

Really good service and they gladly split our bill for us. I'd say this is a hidden gem and you should try it out!"}
{"text":"I think this is more Peruvian comfort food.  Having enjoyed the food in Peru, I anticipated a visit to this recommended restaurant.  Even went with a Native who did all the ordering. I would not expect anyone to know American food if I served them Mac & Cheese. This was not what I remembered from my trip, but as a tourist there I must have eaten differently than locals."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Peruvian food and by far blew my expectations! My dad had been here 2 times prior and although it's pretty far for my boyfriend and I (we live in northern las vegas) it was definitely worth the long drive! Luckily my work is about 10 mins away so my sister and I are going to be returning customers  I def recommend the Lomo saltado with the steak! Soooooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. High quality food, fresh ingredients and tasted great, for a very low price. Way better than the crap served in the buffets on the stip.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is seriously lacking.  I paid in advance here online & called to say I would be there in 1 hour.  I arrive & door is locked, 30 min before closing time.  I had to call to get them to open door.  They make us wait another 20 minutes to say they don't even have what we ordered. I thought this online option would speed things up, apparently not.  :( very unsatisfied with the service at Inka Grill!  Might have to take my business to another Peruvian place."}
{"text":"Mmmm the ceviche was yummy  

I hadn't had inka cola since I was a kid so that was a nice change and just as good as I remembered 

Im not totally sure what we ordered it was like a green spaghetti with chicken and it was  DELICIOUS I wlll totally go back for round 2"}
{"text":"My brother and I originally tried Inka Grill back in February 2014. We LOVED their food. We lived in Bolivia when we were younger, so were excited to find a restaurant with a lot of similar cuisine to Bolivia. The owner greeted and served us and was so gracious to talk with us for a long time.

My brother had the Lomo Saltado and I had the Milanesa de Pollo (always my favorite). Both dishes were flavored amazingly. They came with salad (with the best dressing). Loved the sauces (the green is my favorite). It was great to have a Pisco Sour too. Since then, we have returned with different friends and family and the food is always excellent and reasonably priced.

My only feedback would be to brighten up the deco. Occasionally the service has been a little slow (was not the owner serving us)."}
{"text":"Apparently this place was just re-opened.    No idea, I just went in, there's little booths on the walls, no decor to write home about.

I was greeted by the waitress/cashier, ordered food to go, she spoke to me in English even though I spoke to her in Castellano Spanish and was very polite.  She kinda seemed rude.

She did however suggest a few meals after asking if I'd tried Peruvian food before.

I got the grilled chicken order, with veggies and salad, para llevar (to go)

It was under $10, was a full container of veggies and a huge chicken breast piece with delicious seasonings.  The salad was packed to the top with fresh lettuce and they gave me 3 sauces.  One I used for the salad, the other two were spicy.

I was starving, had just finished 2.5 hours of massage, I ate every bite.  Delicious and fresh.  Will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Glad I stumbled upon this place. It's amazing. I had the saltado pollo w a side of fried plantains...delicious and freshly cooked straight off the pan. Amazing sizzling flavors, different with every bite, but also very clean. Not greasy or heavy at all. I then had the fried donuts for desert w a cup of hot water w lemon. The donuts I thought were gonna be real heavy but they were light and crisp and you dip them in a light syrup which was amazing. 

Service was on point 100% very nice and attentive

Love love love this place"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday in the evening and ordered the famous Peruvian Ceviche and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! It was a full house and it was only one server at the moment but she handled it like a totally pro. I was a little skeptical at first because the server was cuban but for my surprise she knew the menu by heart with every single ingredient better than any other peruvian restaurant in town with peruvian servers. The Ceviche was delicious and beautiful, the price was really cheap compared to the quality of food and the service! If i could i would give it a 10 start! Too bad is a little far from my house, but the drive is worth it and the have a customer for life with me. CONGRATULATION!!!"}
{"text":"After driving 20 miles, on Saturday we finally arrived for our first and not knowingly our last meal at the Inka Grill.  Small location in strip mall, which is not a turn off, since we've found excellent food in small, family owned restaurants.  They were not busy, only 4 tables with guests, lunch time, we got there around 1:30.  The server came and took our drink orders, 1 beer, 1 pisco sour and 1 soda.  She returned about 5 minutes later with the beer and soda, no pisco sour; and took our food order. We asked for the yuca huancaina as the appetizer, 2 cevices and 1/4 grilled chicken.  Out came the yuca, a small portion considering the price, but ok. Still no pisco sour...when we asked the waitress, she said the gentleman that makes them had stepped out, but we would get our drink as soon as he came back. 25 minutes passed by before one of the ceviches came, then 5 minutes later the chicken. When the second ceviche was brought out 10 minutes AFTER the chicken (I still don't understand why both ceviches weren't served at the same time), the waitress suggested we get something other than the pisco sour.  When asked what happened, she just stayed quiet. We ordered 2 beers.  

The portions were adequate, nothing spectacular or to rave about. The portions of the fish pieces for the ceviche were a bit large. Chicken was good, not overcooked, seasoning was alright. Again nothing worth coming back for.
Our waitress checked with us one time to see how everything was, the next time she came by was with the bill. What a surprise! There was the pisco sour in all it's glory being charged on our bill.  When asked why it had not been removed, she stated that the 2 beers would not be charged, however the 2 beers at $3.50 each should have been $7, not $8. When this was pointed out, her reply was, \"oh, yes, he'll give you back a dollar, when you pay\".  Really? We asked if the manager was available and was told he only comes in for dinner time.  We texted him a message to the number under the cash register, still have not received a reply.

If the manager can't trust his staff to make adjustments or corrections on the bills, then he should have an assistant manager during the hours he's not there.  Terrible service, definitely not worth going there.  Much better Peruvian food elsewhere in the valley.

Oh, and BTW. The cashier didn't give us the $1 after all."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has earned its 5 stars. One of my favorite dishes is the Lomo Saltado and this is the only spot in Vegas that makes it the way I like. 

The ladies hear are kind and know exactly what I order. I've lived in Peru for 2 years and just reading the menu and being here for an hour is enjoyable.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is a mediocre example of Peruvian food and the service was even worse.

I ordered tiradito, a ceviche-like dish. It need salt, but was the best thing I had. I also tasted the yucca in huancaina sauce. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can or packet. Not only have I had better huancaina sauce at other Peruvian Las Vegas restaurants, I can make better huancaina sauce at home, and I'm not even Peruvian. 

The service was also terrible. When we were paying for the meal, our empty appetizer plates still hadn't been cleared from the table. The service was slow, which is surprising since we were the only people there. Our waitress was on the phone taking an order when she brought out our food. She's also the person who made our drinks, which were not good and overpriced.

If you want good Peruvian food, go to Mi Peru on Horizon Ridge. It's not as good as Peruvian food you'd get in Miami, L.A., but it's the best you're going to get in Vegas. At least you won't want to ask for your money back like at Inka Grill."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This is my 3rd time here and I am getting a to-go order because I have been craving this food so bad but I don't have time to sit and eat. I moved here from South Beach Miami and I know my Peruvian food. Nothing I have ordered has been disappointing. Service is good food is awesome! Don't forget the pisco sour best I've had! I'm a new customer for life! Schannel and Charlie!"}
{"text":"I called to this place to make an order over the phone for pick up , I was placed on hold for over 20 minutes !!!!!!! Crazy that I even waiting that long but that's how bad I wanted to eat here, to bad I will never again call or even step foot in this restaurant bc of the bad experience I had over ordering on the phone , YOUR CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE YOUR PRIORITY !"}
{"text":"Bring it up several notches, Inka! The Lomo Saltado was terrible. There was more fat on my steak than steak. The place was pretty slow (only 3 tables being serviced) and the waitress could not be any slower. Not only could she not be any slower, she was also pretty rude. When our dishes were brought out she loudly kinda tossed them at the edge of the table and walked away to another table. Our food came out before she remembered to bring the drinks, just didn't get an overall good vibe about this place. I'm glad I tried it and got the curiosity out of the way, but will not be a returning customer. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Channel 13 Action News of Las Vegas just rated them tonight as Dirty Dining since they were shut down by food inspection for 2 days until they cleaned up the dirty blood, slime, mold, mixed matched dirty utensils, and dirty molded food that was unidentifiable. Feel free to research this from the health and food inspection department if you believe other wise. As a good samaritan I wanted to bring it to your attention ."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend a few days ago. The location is nearby our house, easy to get to and find parking and all that.  The place has a number of booths that are not very comfortable (think hard plastic from fast food restaurants) -- it would probably seat about 10 groups of 4 people.  It was not very busy and there was only one server/cashier on duty.  

My girlfriend ordered ceviche and purple corn juice for a drink and I ordered one of the combos that had sausage, pork, chicken breast, and a chicken skewer with french fries. I noted that towards the back of the menu they had some Peruvian/Chinese dishes, weird.

The ceviche arrived in a reasonable amount of time but it took over 15 minutes from the time the ceviche arrived to when my food was served.  I hate this at restaurants.  Don't stick a plate of food in front of someone when the other person has nothing to eat.  

The purple corn juice had an intriguing flavor.  I didn't like it or dislike it really.  My girlfriend said the ceviche was amazing.  The pork I had was oddly spiced but I'd eat it again, the chicken was really good, but oddly the \"sausage\" was literally just a hot dog.  I'm used to sausage being a hot dog in Japanese, but in Peruvian?  Whatever.  The fries were good.  At the end of the meal we were served fortune cookies.  I guess more of that Chinese/Peruvian influence.

Anyway, I really disliked the service and how long it took to get my food, especially considering that it was not busy.  Some of the food was really good and some was not so good.  The price was fine.  I doubt I will ever go by myself again, but with other people then sure."}
{"text":"Ordered ceviche, chicken with pesto-like sauce, and beef with tomatoes and onions with rice.

My boyfriend really liked his chicken and pesto dish.  The sauce in my dish was good, but beef wasn't seasoned.  The ceviche sauce was good, but seafood wasn't fresh.  I'd probably go back again just for the ceviche.

Reason I gave it a 3-star, instead of a 4-star, is because the prices were way too high for a little and casual restaurant.  I spent $45!  I'd spend $45 for a casino restaurant, not at Inka-Grill."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience, Ordered Lomo Saltado again with a big ceviche and Yucca Frita

Service was great, that was the only reason I did not give a 5 before. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I'm sad that the pollo com arroz is no longer on the menu but I still think this place is stellar with the new owners."}
{"text":"I don't readily give out 5 stars... but if I could give Inka 10 I would.  Small individually owned place with cozy atmosphere and the owner is just amazing.  On to the food. Wow.... wow... wow, wow, wow, wow.  We had a party of four and each ordered a couple of items to share.  The rotisserie chicken is out of this world.  I had the \"Lomo Saltado\" which is a marinated skirt steak with veggies and rice.  The marinated meat literally just melted in your mouth (Pro-tip: order it with \"extra juice).  We also tried the  \"Parihuela\" soup which is a seafood soup.  Slap-yo-momma good. The broth had the perfect amount of spice and body, and the seafood (fish, calamari, muscles, etc) was fresh and perfectly cooked.  Also!  The house made Peruvian sauces were literally a symphony of flavors perfectly balanced with fresh flavors and spice.  We will be definitely back next week and many more to come.

Go there.  Try it.  Tell'um I sent ya... and if you don't like, I'll give you your money back! (no refunds for clean plates and licked fingers)."}
{"text":"The food was different than what I originally eat. The food was ..... Good, it wasn't horrible or anything. The reason I gave this restaurant one star was because the service was horrible. Not only to my family but I recognized that other guests that came to eat were also being ignored. The thing that can make or break a restaurant is by their food and the customer service. In this case the customer service may actually break this restaurant. I'm the type that not only comes back for the food but also the service."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would!!!
Because we don't know/have any other Peruvian restaurant close to us (plus we were in the same shopping center as the restaurant) decided to get some food to go.

We got choritos and jalea. I ended up eating the choritos by myself since they were a bit too hot for my husband's taste.

I've been sick for a couple of days now. I got indigestion, nausea, some fever AND now diarreah from eating that!! I know it was the choritos because I had nothing else other than tea with crackers in the morning and nothing at night since I felt bloated!!

PLEASE be careful with the choritos!! They might not be fresh.

I WON'T BE ORDERING OR EATING AT THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Would never guess this hidden gem from the outside. Food is delicious. Ceviche, fried fish, seafood soup, peruvian corn - everything was perfect."}
{"text":"So the place closed and reopened under a new name, El Ceviche, though they haven't changed the sign.  My 21-year old daughter who had lived in Peru wanted to eat there bad so we went.  I was very cautious.

We ordered three dishes and all were quite good.  The ambiance was lacking but the food was traditional Peruvian and excellent."}
{"text":"All the reviews I read before I entered this place was that the food was great but the service had a lot to be desired.

On this day, we did not find anything wrong with the service.  In most places like this, people do not really understand the culture and expect quick, fast service, however, this is not the case, however, you will be served and taken care of like no other, it just may not be as fast as you would like.

On to the food.  We ordered the Tacu Tacu and it was in our opinion the best we have had out of all the places we have been to in town that serve up the same dish.

I had the 1/2 roasted chicken and the taste was AMAZING.  We also had a beef saltalldo and it was just as AMAZING as everything else.

The food is worth the visit and as for the service, we were not disappointed, we acttually had two people coming by and checking on us several times.

This is a place we will be back too not only for the food but for the service and the culture.  These are the hardest working people and if this place gets busy, just don't be in a hurry, if you are go eat somewhere else but understand you will miss and AMAZING meal and experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I moved out here to vegas about 8 months ago one of the hardest things was to find a good Peruvian reataurant. Well I found one this place is amazing I have eaten at over 30 different Peruvian restaurants in Between LA and NV this is deffinetly top 5 amazing food and seasoning!"}
{"text":"Check out the U Tube video.....Dirty Dining  from last year..... It will make you sick.
All I can say is Kaylani must have \" stumbled in \" when she walked into this place.
They have changed their name AGAIN.....No longer Inka Grill....And they are not open
during the day Mon - Fri.
They keep running but they cannot hide."}
{"text":"Good food, but really bad service from the waitresses! Please provide more training to them. The bachata music all the time.. Sucks!!!"}
{"text":"I should be putting 3 stars, but I put 4 because of the flavor. It's so good but the portions you get for the price, it bums me out :/. I paid 15.08 for lomo saltado to go and it didn't even fill up the styrofoam box! But  the flavors were amazing! I will only eat here on occasion due to the prices and portions. I rather drive an extra 10 min to go to Mi Peru. Their portions are gigantic for about the same price as Inks Grill."}
{"text":"Horrible service !!!  The server dosent even know the menu . We are never coming back, the food is not that great I dont recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Bad service!!!! My  husband and I walked in and there was not one single table with people. When we walked in she said she would be with us in min. She went back to finish her conversation for a while and then we finally got our drink order in. The server tried to walk away but we had sat there for a while so we wanted to order. She was very busy in the back talking with others and a child in the kitchen. At one point she came out with food singing in the middle of our conversation-_- I have many other incidents with this place and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place was great! Had two appetizers to start. The mussels were out of this world delicious! The yucca appetizer was yummy too. I had the green pasta and chicken milanesa entree which was delicious. Food was very fresh and well seasoned. Will definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch. We wanted to try something new. Never having tried Peruvian food, we followed  the waitress' suggestions. I can't remember the names of what we had, but we shared two entrees, one beef, one chicken, both were good. Nothing fancy, but good, new flavors, at least for me. That's why i would recommend, and will be visiting again, this establishment ."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie was super skeptic about this place. It's one of those restaurants where you're thinking...what am I getting myself into?

Never judge a book by its cover. It's was a great choice. They only had one server but she was great. Super quick. It seemed like they are the type that can run out of food because it's made to order. Which is good and bad. We all shared the only chicken they had left. Ha! (Notice pictures)

Food was really good! The chicken was some of the best chicken I've had in a while. I was shocked out tender and juicy it was. 

Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent...I'm not sure what was better though, the food or the amazing service that we received!!! The owner was fantastic and made sure that our first experience a great one. I've never eaten Peruvian food before and can't figure out what has taken me so long to try it. I'm glad I did today. I will definitely be back here as it is close to my work and everything we tried was excellent."}
{"text":"Recently love Peruvian food. Ordered lomo saltado, and green spaghetti w breaded chicken, and shrimp chowder, fried plantains, 
Breaded chicken on spaghetti was the best A-MAZING!!! It was only lightly breaded but so rich with flavor!!! I think green spaghetti was a pesto/cilantro type flavor. Very tasty and fresh. 
Plantains and just like you would expect. 
Discount drink menu, ordered margaritas good portion in cup. 
Soup was not like an American chowder. Had lots of rice in it, lots of shrimp, and some egg we think."}
{"text":"There was only one waitress and she clearly hates her job/life. She brought out a couples food and the man asked about his potato and she replied sarcastically,  \"it's on its way, I only have 2 hands.\" I understand she was stressed because she was the only server and there were 8-9 tables but she was very rude. Other than that, food was ok."}
{"text":"This place is now called jukebox but it's still AMAZING Peruvian food. At night it's a hookah lounge and I think it's more like fast food but try to stop by during the day and try their beef skewers or breaded chicken over pesto linguine. They also have a good happy hour 3-6! Definitely worth trying! And it's also very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Food was great, we were given samples of our drinks and as a first time Peruvian food eaters... The food was great. The salad was a my personal favorite along with Wonton Soups. The biggest issue we had was the service. Understandable people have bad days at times, but good lord, when someone is telling you they are new, please don't have a crummy attitude to explain or to even serve. Will be going back for the food,but the service can use some help. Be thankful you have a job, may not be a dream job, but you're healthy and well enough to work. Attitudes are not needed or if someone goes up to your desk you pay attention and ask if something is needed, don't simply ignore. That was tonight's service and my child ignored as he had stuck a coin in the tiny toy machines and nothing coming out. When serving plates please be curious about it, serving them as if it's for the dog, THAT was not needed. Thank you for reading. Never left a comment before and don't usually care for being a pain, but it was really not needed."}
{"text":"Support your small local businesses! Food was delicious! We came in a little early and we were the only customers there so we were a little nervous. This food was delicious! The server recommended a Peruvian drink and it was awesome! I had the Saltado de Pollo and my wife had Lomo Saltado. They were both perfectly cooked and delicious. This is a great little spot. It's always good to see a small business do well so go there and tell your friends!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the weekend and wanted something different than buffet so decided to drive and came across this place... AMAZING!!! my favorite :) 
Highly recommend :))"}
