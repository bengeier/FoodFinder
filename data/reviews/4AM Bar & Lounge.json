{"text":"A great place to meet up with some friends and get a few drinks! Spacious area with a lot of tables. Friendly staff and the food is great. Drank more than usual when I went because it was easy going and met new people! Fun place to spend your night :-)"}
{"text":"This place had a great vibe and atmosphere. I'm not one to typically go to a lounge or bar, but in all honesty, it had a very chill atmosphere! I don't even drink, yet I still enjoyed my time with the bartender. I sampled some type of Korean beef, which was quite tasty, and had a great, non-alcoholic Caesar. Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to come here and hang out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, drinks are quite unique and the staff are professional and attractive. Great location as well, very convenient from the subway and highway."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were very good! It's Korean fusion. I'm definitely going back for the mini burgers!!"}
{"text":"Show this bar some love! Great location with easy access to subway and highway for people who are driving. You can't miss this bar with all those bright lights shining from afar.  If you're looking for a night out, funky drink + food menu, good vibes + music, but not exactly feeling up to a clubbing night, well then this bar + lounge is right up your alley.   I've been here a handful of times and not once did I leave unsatisfied with my experience in the superb, attentive customer service, the food (kimchi bulgogi fries was the bomb.com), the variety of drink options, and most importantly, the perfect ambience.  This bar + lounge is perfect when your plan is to just grab a few drinks, apps such as sliders or fries, and lounge around. Next thing you know, it's midnight and you have no intention of leaving anytime soon ;)"}
{"text":"I usually don't go to bars/lounges, but there I was with a group of friends. The staff were super friendly and nice (Ryla and Brittany). I had their wings, sliders, kimchi pancake, kimchi bulgogi fries, and crispy chicken wings.  They were all good, but I REALLY enjoyed their sliders. The patty was soft, and it was well-balanced with the toppings they included. It was bigger than a typical slider so I would say it was well worth the $10."}
{"text":"good music, nice selection of cocktails, beer pong table, fun staff."}
