{"text":"I shop COSTCO about once a month, I just found out last month that I could call in my order for pizza and pay on my grocery check out if I wanted, what a deal and for and only 9.99 I had a combination pizza about 16'. No waiting it line to order how great is that. Just bought one yesterday and it is very good as always. They have great prices on everything at the food court.. I am single,and I buy quite a bit of frozen food so much is wrapped individually I just take one out at  a time or just shake out what I need, so much cheaper than grocery stores especially the product, prices you cant beat."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible customer service. Very bad experience with ordering a pizza. Paid for two whole pizza with Costco card. Was told by cashier it would be 10-15 minutes. Set timer on phone for 15 minutes, had teenaged son to check on order 12 minutes in. He came back to wait area said lady cashier said it would be 25 minutes but she did not sound too sure.

After 3 more minutes when 15minute timer went off. I spoke to another cashier in food court and showed her my paid receipt and asked how much longer. She went back to where the pizza orders were and spoke to some guy and came back and said order was never processed and that I was suppose to let them know I wanted them to start making my pizza. Go figure, I thought me paying for and ordering the pizza was indication I wanted them to make pizzas. 

I was then told it would be another 15 or 20 minutes for them to make the pizza. I set my timer again, and went to the original cashier who said that it would be 10-15 minutes. He had this stunned look on his face, until his assistant told him very quietly you have to let them know to make the pizza. He apologized and then tried say it was up to me to let the food court know I wanted them to make pizza I had paid for. 

Then when the 15 timer went off again, we went to check on pizza; our pizzas were sitting their waiting, you would think they would have hand delivered after the numerous mixups when they were ready.

I have ordered pizzas before at other Costco locations without all of this confusion. I won't be using this location's food court - #737 again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, got it home, and looks horrible, there are 7 3 inch bubbles in the dough where there is no cheese or toppings. Why wouldn't they remake it????"}
{"text":"Can someone tell me the difference between a hot dog and a Polish dog? Its been 20 years and I still can't figure it out."}
{"text":"Cheap but decent food.  Good place to eat after shopping(no I don't eat at every sample station multiple times)."}
{"text":"Love the greasy pizza, it's so gooey and delicious! Also the frozen yogurt is delicious and a steal, drinks are cheap and staff is nice"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Costco on North Decatur but stopped by this Costco since I was in the area. The food court in this Costco is over-crowded and unorganized. Surprising since it's Costco. The food court is built very close to the registers so the line spills our everywhere. Costco needs to redo this food court. The food is good - typical Costco food - pizza, hot dogs, sandwiches and drinks. All cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"This seems like a silly review to me because... who doesn't love Costco?! Costco pizza is an addiction and I would prefer them to any other pizza fast food company!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I am a hot dog fiend. So every couple of weeks I need to stop into Costco just to have a \"Polish and soda\" fix. This Costco is convenient to my home, and the people behind the food counter are friendly, courteous, and helpful. Been doing the hot dog thing for years; the Food Court team at the Decatur Costco does a great job of waiting on customers, preparing the food (always hot, fresh, and ready), and even on busy days you are always greeted with a smile. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Slowest place - be prepare to wait an hour before you get your pizza.  One one cashier for 50 people in line.  Then you have to go to another line.  Keeps telling you 20 min every time.  Don't come if you want something quick. Caesars pizza is faster! Don't trust them when they say pizza is in the oven."}
{"text":"Great got dogs and yogurt, the line is always long and the food court always filled. But when u have a couple of bucks for lunch or a treat, this is the place to go after shopping."}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab some fast food and it's way better than Sams Club food court. Everything here tasted great or we were just really hungry. I must say it can get pretty busy, but it's well worth the wait. I really only have one thing to add and its that they should have the hot dog buns the same size as the hot dogs because the dogs are way too big for the bun. The pizza is great for a really nice price and the pull pork sandwich is really out of this world. The seating can be challenging if you've got a grocery cart with you and it's always really crowded so we'll sometimes park the cart in a place where we can see it at all times or just take the food to the car and eat it there. The way this food court is busy all the time is testament to how good and great a deal it is."}
{"text":"Shopping at Costco is almost always a huge headache, and without fail, even after purchasing massive portions of food, I have no interest in cooking after shopping here and typically end up stopping for a meal on my way out- looking forward to the yogurt parfait treat is almost motivation to shop here in the first place!

Menu is simple, but the fact that they only accept cash is a huge pain in the ass.
The hotdogs, Caesar salad, hotdogs, and pizza are all of acceptable quality, even considering the very small price tags. Speaking of size, portions are beyond enormous. Order half as much as you think you'll need.

In addition to the cash-only policy*, the traffic jam of exiting people and their overloaded baskets stopping and causing congestion are additional downsides to the placement of the Food Court area. There needs to be a designated place for carts.


*Rumor has it (AKA, the tips on the app) that they now accept AmEx and debit here. Have not yet tried this myself. Thanks to Tracy P for the info!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat on a budget. Lol. Kidding aside, the food court is great. They make everything fresh and have lots of choices. My wife and kids love the pizza and I like the hot dog combos."}
{"text":"Great lunch place can't beat $1.50 for a polish dog and a drink, pizza is fantastic, never been disappointed with any of the food."}
{"text":"Got a pizza and a salad here last week and everyone that are the salad came down with food poisoning. Never getting the salad here again."}
{"text":"Love the cheap prices!  Hot dog and churro is the best lunch you can get. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"I have been shopping at Costco in Summerlin for nearly fourteen years and enjoy shopping here.  I have eaten at the food court on a dozen or so occasions.  This past Thursday night at closing (8:30pm) I ordered a hot dog and added mustard and onions.  I was on my back for the next three days with food poisoning.  I went to Urgent Care late Friday afternoon because I was so sick and was prescribed an antibiotic that is given to people with Anthrax along with an anti-nausea medication.  This is day four and I'm finally able to get up and get around, although I am still weak and tired.  I will never again eat at the Costco Food Court in Summerlin (west Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"Yum!!! It's fast and super cheap. Everyone hustles and makes sure the line moves. Kitchen is clean. Only complaint is they need to clean their tables more often... I'm sure it's hard because so many people are moving in and out. And it becomes near impossible to park your cart and the seating area...... but it's all good. Can't beat the price. Churros are yummy, pizza is bomb, chicken bakes are good, and the Polish dog combo can't be beat. The ice is like the small chunky ice but bigger so it's log like ice? I like it. Pepsi products for beverages too. All IN all, It's great to eat for your before Costco fuel up OR the after burner.... that is if you don't get too full from the samples around the store"}
{"text":"I always just get the hotdog and soda combo for $1.50.   Price is right and always hits the spot.  For a food court inside of a Costco, it's good.  The wife loves the frozen yogurt.   I think today I'm gonna try a churro and see what's up with it.  Sometimes seating is limited on weekends.  But if you want a big, tasty hot dog on the cheap and a drink.  This is your place.  They have a nice assortment of condiments.   Ketchup, mustard, raw onion, relish.   Haven't tried any of the other items yet except for the pizza which I thought was decent."}
{"text":"Best deal in town $1.50 foot long hot dog and a large soda and it's good!  Very fast service"}
{"text":"Great place to get food for the family. They have great pricing on pizza! Also you can't come to costco and not get a hot dog and a drink it's only $1.50. You can't beat that anywhere else. I love their pizza and polish hot dogs. Also they have sauerkraut if you ask for some. There churros are amazing as well & only $1! I had the salad once it was okay but I'm not a fan of Ceaser dressing, wish they had ranch."}
{"text":"You know what's better than buying in bulk? Eating on the cheap and that's where the Costco food court comes into play. I'll been going to Costco since the early nineties with my parents back when I used to be just pretzels hot dogs and that's it. The selection has changed immensely over the years. From three different types of pizza sold by the slice for 1.99 churros giant chicken salad hot dogs chicken bakes ice cream sundaes brisket sandwich there's a little something for everybody. The only downside is that Costco is packed almost all the time. The lines move pretty quick. However seating is limited, really makes me wish that they would build that new Costco on st. Rose to cut down on the crowds. However with a little finesse you're able to Grub before you shop or after. You can also order a whole pizza for 9 bucks."}
{"text":"There's this two cashiers who keep on rolling their eyes the name was deidra and she doesn't know how to deal with an angry customers."}
{"text":"Costco P I Z Z A is so good. Amazing how it's so cheap. Definitely worth ordering and taking it home."}
{"text":"COSTCO FOOD COURT IS THE BOMB!

Every time I shop here at Costco, more often then not, I end up eating at the food court. So of course I always end up looking to check in and nada, zip, zilch, nothing! So now for all of you that are reading this, HOORAY! You can check in now! Maybe it will get you some type of badge.

As everybody knows, the Costco Food Court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves! Let's see, you got your choice of either a Polish or All American Hot Dog that comes with a drink for $1.50! Can I get an AMEN! A Chicken Bake for $2.99, a Toasted Ciabatta Turkey Sandwich for $3.99, and some other items that catch your eye as well like a huge slice of either Cheese, Pepperoni, or Combination pizza for umm......damn I cant remember cuz I only order it for my kids.

Anyways, you guys get what im saying. They have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet. I say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food court!

The only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash. You would think that since you can pay with either debit or American Express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up. NOT! Although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better, that still is kind of a hassle.

In the end, I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here. Imagine a Costco thats 24 hours. Now THATS something to behold! It IS Vegas so you never know. In the meantime, I can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I had an extremely horrible experience here my first day moving to Vegas. An older gentleman reached down behind me and into my pants and pretended like he didn't know what was going on. When we called the manager, he tried grabbing her chest. Again, this was my very first day in Vegas. It took me awhile to get over what happened since I was so shaken up- I absolutely hated Vegas for a long time and thought things like \"This would never happen at the SSF Costco\". In any case, the manager did her best, but I was so traumatized at the moment. I wish I had called the cops or done something more. We learned later that the man's wife eventually came and Costco management had talked to her about what happened. It took me a long time to be comfortable eating here again and when I do, I'm super vigilant about it. 

People here get kind of weird in general. I've left my food at a table for a minute to get soda, and multiple times I've seen people already eyeing it wondering if they should take it. The staff here is efficient, they try to clean up messes as soon as possible, and things are mostly stocked. Food quality is better than other Costcos.  It's really the patrons that make things difficult and unruly. It would probably be better if the food court had a separate entrance and was separate from the store so it doesn't feel like all hell is breaking loose."}
{"text":"So I'll start with a brief description . I feel guilty telling my bad story because the final pizza was really , really good .

Called in for two pizzas , just cheese . Simple eh ? 

Told half an hour or so .

Came in half an hour , told not ready yet . 

Okay . 

Wait 10 mins , ask about it . No good answers . 

Wait 5 , 5 , 5 finally it's been over an hour total . 

My wife asks what's up for what the 4th time now? 

They say oh yeah we got you right here we've been calling out the name for 20 minutes . 

Well that's a crock of crap , we've been right here in front of the pickup counter . 

Shows us the old crusty dry cold pizzas that have been sitting due to their lack of communication . 

Says \" these are yours , take them \"

Me \" you're high on drugs those pizzas are older than nam (Vietnam war) \" 

Woman at counter \" you must be mistaken we don't do drugs here \" 

Me \" well . Then you must do refunds ?! \"

One of the pizza cooks \" nah man it's ok I'll make you two fresh right now \"

The pizzas were awesome, although they took wayyyyyy too long and the communication was god awful . 

Shoutout to the pizza cook who hooked it up .

They're prolly overworked and underpaid ."}
{"text":"Great cheap pizza. Chaotic trying to rustle through the crowd sometimes. Definitely need to expand. I would say only for peak hours by that seems to be every time I'm there."}
{"text":"Everything that is on the menu of Costco Food Court is delicious! So far, I tried almost all the food menu items and they are all GOOD. 

I've tried:
- Beef Hot Dog
- Polish Hot Dog
- Chicken Caesar Salad
- Cheese Pizza
- Pepperoni Pizza
- Combo/Combination Hot Dogs
- Very Berry Sundae
- Vanilla Yogurt
- Chocolate Yogurt
- Swirl Yogurt
- Churro
- Gelato (no longer available)

All of the food I've tried are all GOOD AND ALWAYS FRESH! They have Pepsi brand drinks and guess what, FREE REFILLS! The worst part is the waiting in long line to order. 

MY ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO READS MY REVIEWS: When are you done shopping at Costco Wholesale, you can tell the cashier (Not food court) at Costco to order food items from the food court. Just bring the receipt to the pick up line at the food court and you can just pick up the food there. More easier and simpler way to get your food faster.

Food here is always great and cheap. That's why I always order a whole combination pizza here to go. It's huge and lots of portions of meat! I RECOMMEND YOU TO COME HERE TO GET SOME DELICIOUS FOOD!"}
{"text":"Order the John Holmes Special. It's a great deal for 1:50. The hotdog and coke tastes good."}
{"text":"As usual the food is pretty hard to mess up. It is Costco afterall. But the service is horrible and I think it makes the food taste bad too. They could use some time and stress management training for their team."}
{"text":"Ice cream on a stick, dipped in chocolate and then sprinkled with lots of almonds, love it!!! Big enough to share."}
{"text":"Food use to be good for the price here... but the last 3 times that I came I just noticed that the service is getting worse... At least 30 minutes waiting for one pizza? that's crazy, I ask them to hurry up and I didn't receive answer even when I saw pizzas ready."}
{"text":"I love this costco, I come at least twice a week.Today though, was not a good experience. I had a lot of little things I bought and needed a box. I asked for one, but there lady putting the stuff in my cart looked at me and said \"we're out sweetie\", as I'm staring at a cart full one lane over to her. So I walked over and grabbed box, so she could put the stuff in it (it was raining outside and did not feel like putting stuff in the box on my own with the rain. So, I start talking to the cashier, pay and turn around to see the damn box set ON TOP of my cart.... EMPTY! I'm in awe! Why are people at work NOT working?"}
{"text":"For all of the reasons to step foot inside Costco, their food court ranks at the top for me. Costco brings its commitment to service and quality to your stomach!

Great food at awesome prices, you can't go wrong. The $1.50 giant beef hot dog is probably the only hot dog I will ever eat. $2 for a slice of pizza or $10 for a whole pie is a steal. Better ingredients and much larger than anything you will find at Dominos or Pizza Hut. The food court has snacks such 

Be advised - no credit cards, cash only."}
{"text":"Costco and its food court is super awesome. I remember going to my first Costco food court when I was around 5 or 6. I know their menu has expanded since the traditional hot dog and pizza were some of the only things on there. They have things such as chicken bakes, salads, sandwiches, smoothies, and my favorite, churros. With every bite I take of a hot dog and churro, I get this strong nostalgic feeling that takes me back to when I was young and I'm happy Costco food does that for me. If that isn't enough, the food is relatively cheap, so eating here won't break the bank, especially that $1.50 hot dog and drink."}
{"text":"As opposed to southern CA locations, this place takes American Express. Like the branch in Tustin, CA, they use a line, but it is invisibly designated with yellow tape on the floor. Fortunately, during my visit, there was no confusion. At least it's better than the Irvine, CA branch.

The staff was nice and gave us our food while paying with no issue even though we paid with American Express. They were nice enough to explain that they dont sell those ice cream bars anymore. Functionally, it is no different than  other branches with the exception of the ability to pay with American Express."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here. Food is great and cheap. We're at the DMV today with a 140 numbers in front of us so we decided to go down the street and have a slice of pizza while waiting. Pizza is so yum and big slices!"}
{"text":"Super-low priced fast eats as consistent and good as you'd expect from Costco. The rotisserie chicken (from inside the warehouse section) for just $4.99 was fairly tasty but became more bland away from the skin. The hot dogs are, of course, great though and an insane value!"}
{"text":"Great Hot Dogs and pizza......
Very reasonable prices and fresh.....
Great for quick lunch........
Only sad thing is long lines"}
{"text":"We love going to their food court after our Costco shopping trip.  Their mocha freeze, yogurt swirl and chicken caesar salad are the regular items that we always get from their food court.  So cheap and so yummy.  The lines are sometimes a little long, but it moves pretty fast as their staff are quite efficient in taking the order and serving up the food real fast. They keep their condiments section relatively clean and stocked. I always feel satisfied after a visit to their food court."}
{"text":"As others have said, you can't beat the prices or consistency here. You get your order quickly, and the food is great. Out of most fast food courts, this one is hard to beat. If you're shopping at Costco, you might as well stop here for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I often stop here for a bite to eat after I am done shopping, but I often call ahead to order a whole pizza for pick up. The people working have always been friendly and great about the large orders I've placed for parties. Whole pizzas are 18 inches, priced at $9.95 and you can choose from cheese, combo or pepperoni. I have asked for just sausage on a whole pizza before and since the whole ones are made to order they didn't mind customizing the pie with the toppings of my choice, so just let them know when ordering a whole pizza what you'd like on it. My hubby likes the hot dogs and I do as well from time to time like one with mustard and sauerkraut, both of which are options over by the condiments section where you can dress your dog. The hot dogs are only $1.50 and come with a 20 ounce (free refills) drink. Churros for a buck, sandwiches and the very berry sundae are also offered. It's nice that after all of these years with the price of everything going up that Costco still offers cheap and tasty eats in their food court."}
{"text":"A $3.75 date  My hubby was craving pizza and the pizza at Smith's is 2 for $5..So I told him lets go to Costco. Hotdog with drink is $1.50 and the huge pizza slice is $1.99..How can you beat that? You can never go wrong at Costco. Cheap prices, but quality is never compromised."}
{"text":"Love their all beef hot dog and yogurt cup. The price is really affordable, and the food is great."}
{"text":"This one has gelato! You can't even just get one scoop, you get three for $1.50.  Trust me, you'll be happy you got the push to get two more scoops."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food quality here, and the portions are huge while the prices are low.  The chicken-bacon-ranch roll looks small in the picture, but it's the size of a baby's arm and only $3.  Pizza is better than any other food court pizza.  And it's all really cheap.

TIP:  No cards are accepted, cash/check only."}
{"text":"Great food for cheap to enjoy before or after your shopping. They have a simple menu of pizza, hot dog, BBQ beef sandwich, ceaser salad, chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwich, and ice cream. 

All  items are cheap, large portions, and delicious! You can get a huge hotdog and soda for $1.50. Can't beat that price! The slices of pizza are = to 2 normal slices. They are huge! The ice cream is soft serve so it's very refreshing in the summer. I love the very berry frozen yogurt. 

Highly recommend to grab a few lunch items after your shopping trip! They even have tables out so you can enjoy your food there while it's hot. Easy to park your shopping cart next to the table too. Great for kids/families.

They do accept gift cards, debit card, and cash now."}
{"text":"One thing you cant beat here is the prices. Seriously 1.50 for a polish dog and a drink? You can feed a whole family here for less then $10! Any place that serves Churros is a place I can be found, even if only but once and that goes double for pizza. Friendly yet efficient, a long line moves quickly here. Condiments available at a side counter if you wish to pour endless streams of relish on your sausage."}
{"text":"Costco food court requires a Costco card to get past the front door. This is the cheapest place you can eat in Summerlin. Hot dog or polish sausage and a coke for $1.50. Slice of pizza and a coke $2.50. Bring the kids sports team after practice or the big game. Whole pizzas are $10 and cokes $.50. Get 3 scoops of ice cream for desert for $1.50."}
{"text":"Cheap, consistent, fast and good food. I give it 5 stars because every time they hit these marks. This is great food court food, not 5 star dinning at a fancy restaurant. So in that regards, I love Costco food courts."}
{"text":"Love the churros and strawberry sundaes.. Decent pizzas and sandwiches at great price."}
{"text":"Peakza, Peakza, Peakza!!

As many Mexicans say, peakza! The pizza here is a great deal! 9.99 for a huge 18' pie, you can either get combo, pepperoni, or cheese. I tried to ask for an only pep and mushroom, but got shot down.

Here at the actual food court they only accept cash, if you need to pay with a debit/credit card go to the check out lanes and you can do so. I would also recommend ordering it prior to arriving as it can take  up to 25 mins or longer on a busy day.

The hot dogs and churros are also delectable and super inexpensive. The location here is busy, and they changed their tables around last year so seating is kind of tight. It is, for the most part, always clean, unless slobs do not pick up after themselves. Come on people!

This is my go-to when football or boxing is on for a pie!

Yay!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I don't think food can be cheaper than this. My girlfriend, who had never been to Costco before, asked me how they could make this delicious food so cheap. The only thing I could come up with is they are selling it at cost in order to get more people in!

$1.50 for a quarter pound hotdog WITH a fountain drink? Yes please! We couldn't cook dinner cheaper at home unless we were making rice and washing it down with water. 

They also have $10 whole pizza pies, and I'm not talking mini pies like dominos, these are 18 inch pies! With the quality I've experienced in their other items (plus a few other customers on line told me it was very good), I don't see why you'd ever buy a whole pizza anywhere else. 

The most common thing people write about are the ice creams. I grew up with the frozen yoghurt with berry sauce ($1.65 I believe), and they have continually expanded their offerings. Now they have a mocha frozen drink that many said was unbelievable (and looked unbelievable), and they also had gelato! For like 1.50 for 3 HUGE scoops in a waffle cone. After seeing gelato in the Venetian for like 7 bucks a scoop, I practically threw my money at the Costco cashier (who was super friendly). The gelato was also VERY good (surely not as good as what's at the Venetian but at that price who cares?), what I've come to expect from any Kirkland item. 

Lastly they had some interesting items I've never tried purely because they didn't cost 1.50. The beef brisket sandwich looked incredible, not like one of those \"looks good in our ad\" deals, but when I saw it come out it looked HUGE with a ring around it to keep things nice and clean. Well done. 

If you're late night shopping, and don't feel like cooking, stop here and get some delicious mega cheap food, and wash it down with some gelato!"}
{"text":"Love the giant slices of pizza for $1.99+tax or a whole gigantic for $10+tax!  I also like to get hot dog, can't beat $1.50 which includes a drink!  For dessert get a frozen yogurt or gelato."}
{"text":"$1.50 for a giant beef hot dog. $10 for some pretty awesome pizza. Gelato, chicken baked, and chicken Caesar salad. Everything is inexpensive and good. You can't beat this place for a quick bite to eat. As always, Costco rules!!!!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Thanks, person who unnecessarily added this \"business\" to Yelp.

The Costco food court is a good value but also surprisingly delicious. Their hot turkey and provolone sandwich is great. It has surpassed the chicken bake as my go-to item. The mocha freeze or berry smoothie is a good accompaniment. Of course, the best value is the $1.50 hot dog with 20oz drink. But I can never get myself to settle for that."}
{"text":"I love their hot dogs and the vanilla and chocolate swirl. 

I don't usually like hot dogs but I keep asking my husband to come here on weekends to eat their hot dogs and their food samples. 

I just recently discovered the vanilla and chocolate swirl. It's HUGE!!!! I didn't expect that it was that much. First time I got it, I tried so hard to finish it but I accomplished, like, 10% of it. I was so full that I had to bring it home, put it in the freezer. It turned out actually very good frozen yogurt/ice cream. I ate it as a little dessert for about a week and my husband joked around that it was the cheapest date he'd ever had with me. He now likes it too, in terms of buying it for me, instead of other desserts :) I keep coming back for these things, besides their gas."}
{"text":"When I lived in Henderville this is where I went to. I was waiting in line to get a dog and what an amazing fricking surprise. They all stayed in the yellow line and filled it up all to the front. You don't see this in Summerville. They can't read and can't be bothered to courteously move up so the line can be shortened and shoppers can push their carts past them. Kudos Henderson Costco. Alas, I am perpetually stuck behind hard of hearing and senile people over yonder....and that's not even the seniors...doh! Dare I guess that Hendervillers know there's 2 lines at the exit??? Man oh man, that's just asking for too much of a good thing :)

We won't risk talking about said Summervillians' driving properly in roundabouts. Killzones. :I

[P.S. Those aren't typos here for once :D]"}
{"text":"I love how everything is cheap. The dollar churros are bomb! The pizza is bomb! The polish sausage is bomb and for $1.50 plus tax. Haha but wait there's more. It comes with a drink! The wait isn't too long quick service. Sometimes it might be hard to find a table to sit at. Or a clean one. Some people are just messy eaters. But other than that good food for cheap!"}
{"text":"Super cheap dinner or lunch!! Super fast and it's always coming fresh out of the oven. Only complaint they have Pepsi products now after having Coke for so long. I sad about this change."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Nuff said. Prices are cheap and food is good."}
{"text":"Cheap, no frills food for when you're hungry shopping at Costco. The line can be long during the lunch rush, but it goes very fast. There is almost always seats available even though it's so busy, the real problem is trying to get across the floor with all the carts people have parked randomly while they are grabbing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a foot long beef hotdog and a 20 oz drink with free refills for $1.50 + tax. Enough said 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pros
Located within the Costco warehouse

Able to order full pizzas even after closing as long as your in the club 

Efficient cashiers

Friendly service attitude 

Great price for food

Staff frequently check the tables for cleanliness 


Cons
None thus far"}
{"text":"Costco food court is fast, efficient and decent quality food for the price.  You get an large pizza (I think 18 inches) no toppings for $11!  You should ask for the pizza to be well done with extra cheese and extra sauce! They will do that for free.  Also don't ask for them to cut the pizza in squares....that is one thing they don't know how to do which is so disappointing and baffling that they can't do this!  

So I ask for it to be uncut.  The other food does not look appetizing at all so I won't ever buy it.  The pizza is decent given that Las Vegas has no good pizza places around in the Northwest.  

Don't forget you can call in an order which is super nice and they will have it ready for you when you arrive! 

Of note... when I did call in a pizza, they person commented on how my ethnic name was \"weird sounding...\"  I did not appreciate that."}
{"text":"Costco food courts are an iconic thing for me. The food is really great, and most of all: inexpensive. I look forward to having a slice or a hot dog every time I go -- it's just a given for me. 

This night was like any other I'd gone to Costco's food court; which is to say it felt like Wall Street during a heavy trade. Despite the lines being painted on the floor to remind customers what's what and where to go to get it; it becomes chaos -- and it shows on the faces of the employees as well; on a consistent basis. I get that. After forty-five minutes in line, I was still just as happy to be getting the opportunity to sink my teeth into some melting mozarella. By now, I was ready to take down a churro like something FIERCE, but I didn't want to risk filling my stomach with anything but my pepporoni pizza I ordered. Sorry churro -- NO VACANCY TONIGHT!

As I sat for it to be baked, the chaos didn't end. I sat directly in front of the Pick-Up Window to ensure I'd hear them call my number. Several times, I saw people come up and ask for a time update. The answer was always \"20 more minutes.\" The others would stomp their feet inpatiently as they walked away, and I reminded myself not to be \"That Guy.\" I'll be patient -- let them do their jobs, right?

Well, we're now thirty minutes into my wait. I've now been here for nearly two hours. 

\"It's OK, Adrian -- it's OK to just ask them for an update; just be totally polite!\" I told myself.

I was told twenty more minutes, and I plastered a fake smile onto my face. Hey, this pizza is good stuff and a great deal! I sorta asked for it coming during rush hour anyway, right? At least nobody will have to cook tonight!

..... it's been another half hour, though. I check in, again assuring myself I'm not going to be the person who is obnoxious and rude. 

\"We called you a half hour ago; nobody came to get it so we threw it away.\"

As she said, I heard a pop. It was like a rubber band snapped as it launched a novelty firecracker inside of my head. Hanger has now started to streamline through my blood, and I'm fully infused with it.

I assured them that I wasn't called. I'd kept track of the numbers. There was little to no pattern or consistent pattern. Regardless, I asked what they could do NOW. 

\"I can go get it back and reheat it?\"

**CRACK!!** Blood vessells had now ruptured straight from my brain stem and into my eyes: The only thing I could see was the many, many people who had finished their food around me; all with full stomachs and smiles. I saw the cheschire grins of the husbands getting brownie points by picking up dinner for their wives to have a night off. I then reminded myself that I was literally just offered nuked trash-pizza.

I'd recap what I said to the manager who was hiding behind several other frontline employees, but all I could hear in my own mind was the aneurysm making it's way through the brain circuitry-inferno and to the soles of my feet that left me scrambling for the pharmaceutical aisles for any sort of first aid to help out. Maybe there's a health insurance rep peddling a plan at a booth somewhere. No matter how or who, I'll need medical attention by the end of this episode ......

..... somewhere in the mess, I heard a ringing noise in my ear and was snapped back to reality. And that reality was that the best they could do was put one in right now. You guessed it; it'll be another twenty minutes. I'd also receive a refund. My options were: Leave; upset and hungr(ier,) or get that pizza that I'd waited for this long, and stick it out. I opted to stay. The refund helped prevent a few more pathways being singed in my head, but this was such a horrible folly that I'll never trust my money and time with this particular location; EVER again."}
{"text":"Costco food court has been a staple since I was a little boy. 

You can't beat the hot dog or full size pizza. All are great food options and the ice cream is fantastic.

Cons: hot dog and soda - they don't sell just the hot dog and we don't drink soda. Recent change to Pepsi fountains - ugh. The food court is often completely dirty and blown out. Yes people can be messy slobs - but it's necessary to provide enough staff to keep this area clean and stocked."}
{"text":"$1.50 hot dog or Polish sausage with a drink is hard to beat. Pizza, sandwiches, churros, frozen yogurt are all very good. Excellent value for your money."}
{"text":"99% of the time we stop by eating here after shopping. I always order the Hot Turkey and Provolone sandwich for $3.99 (turkey, provolone, red onions, tomatoes, & pesto on a hot ciabatta roll). Nom nom. 

How can anyone not like Costco food court? Decent food for outrageously cheap prices.  For under $10 I can feed my family of four for lunch. Total WIN! in my book."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Costco food court during lunch! Cheapest and delicious food for only $5 or $6! It sure can get busy here before 12, so I recommend come a little earlier! I usually come here once a week for lunch cause I get to fill up my car too!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot more people than the one j shop at

the grapes are absolutely heavenly this weekend. 

gas is horridly not the price but the time It takes.  

The food seating was inside instead of outside and the places for seating was packed I couldn't. 

The membership  helped me with a problem it took alitlle longer but I didn't have anything to do   They are on a new system and it was slow..."}
{"text":"Super fast.  Call in your pizza order ((9.95 for whole pie)) as you are in store and pay at the cashier.  Pick up at window.   Good inexpensive food. Fast.

All the folks behind the counter are super friendly and helpful.  

Pizzas take about 20 mins.  But if you call in on weekend or busy holiday  recommend 40 mins."}
{"text":"Great ice cream, specially the Sunday's with chocolate syrup on top. I may not be able to finish it in the first sitting, but the next day is just as good."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in vegas. Everything on the menu is great, you can't go wrong. Taste and quality is amazing and the prices are even better."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for the price. Although seating isn't always easy to get, and the line can be long, that lunch bill is kinda awesome. Pizza slices are large, the hot dogs are big, and the cones are a treat. 

Someone at my job ordered 2 large pizzas and picked them up. For only $20 total they were tasty and filling and very large. Not skimpy on the layers of crust, cheese and tomato sauce, making even the plain pizza very satisfying."}
{"text":"Clean & Friendly. Need more hands on the floor, I'm always hunting for help... most of the time I don't find anyone or they are walking in pairs and pay no mind. The food is ALWAYS delicious from the food court. The food samples/demos are always a treat."}
{"text":"When I go to Costco I usually always stop by the restaurant. I especially like the large combo pizza for $10. It feeds 3 people equally. Just add some beers and friends and you can have a great night without breaking the bank. The polish hot dog or beef hot dog with a drink for about $1.60 (can't remember the price exactly) is also a great deal. I heard the frozen yoghurt is delicious as well but I haven't tried it yet. Nice people work here, they are fast, so have your payment and order ready when it's your turn.

Yum Yum."}
{"text":"Arti is an example of how managers should be, especially in establishments like costco.  Ordered a pizza back in February, was double charged and they took care of us with my proof of purchase.  Thank you costco pizza staff for redeeming the issue.  5 star service all the time !"}
{"text":"$1.50 for a huge hotdog and a drink, you really can't beat that. Also, I enjoy their pizza slices as well. It's a nice lunch just to grab while you are there."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Costco... Seriously? 
You get free samples, great prices, mass quantities of who-knows-what, photos printed, contact lenses, prescriptions filled, fresh fruit, toilet paper, mattresses, wine galore, and pretty much anything in between. I love that they don't use plastic bags, no one should. Bring your own large reusable bags for the small items. Duh, that should be standard everywhere! They also have a great return policy. 

The down side? 
You can't use your credit card to rack up those points for free flights. So hello debit card, let me wipe the dust off of you and give you a swipe. 
The parking situation is intense. People act like they're allergic to walking far distances, but ironically enough, once in the store, that's EXACTLY what you're doing! So avoid the crazies and park in Egypt. 
There are never enough employees working in the photo center. The two lovely ladies that are usually there work their little butts off non-stop and there's still always a line of people with questions. 
Sundays are INSANE! Avoid going on this day at all costs. Unless you take a Xanax."}
{"text":"The workers in the food court always look pissed and don't really care for being pleasant and not rude. In fact sometimes they even go out of their way to be rude to you. Today I went to get vanilla ice cream in the food court and I was standing in one of the three lines they have to stand in to order and the worker there looked at me the back of the line and said \"You know there's a line\" and other workers  and even  one person in line were like \"yeh you're not in the line\"and I responded \" I'm in line\". I looked around the floor to confirm I was standing in said line. They literally went out of their way to be extremely rude to me when I did nothing wrong. I was so embarrassed and one lady standing in the line next to me gave me a sympathetic look. The people who work in the food court are grumpy, sad and have no life and they take it out on their customers. I wish I would have done something to stand up for myself more. At least I had vanilla ice cream as my $1.29 consolation prize."}
{"text":"There's literally nothing special about this place other than it has ridiculously cheap food. Whenever I'm at Costco, I always come here just because it's so cheap! Hot dogs with a drink is $1.50 and pizza with a drink is $1.99. You can't beat that! Surprisingly the food is pretty good too. Cheap and tasty food is very hard to come by nowadays. 

The one issue with this place is that it's always packed. The line is typically pretty long. Fortunately it goes by quick and you have your food in your hands in just a few short minutes.

If you're at Costco, it would be stupid if you not to get something. When will you ever get an opportunity to get food this cheap? That's why I always stop by!"}
{"text":"Good, if not excellent value, food for the price customers pay at the Costco Food Court. Even then I am fairly certain they are still making a small profit while providing value added service to Costco members.

And seriously, even if Costco just breaks even or operates the food court at a nominal loss (highly doubtful), the loss leader strategy still contributes to the positive and profitable warehouse operation. I have to try really, really hard to spend under $20 on a visit, and it usually ends up being in the $100-200 range just shopping for myself.  Do the math, and a typical family likely spends a couple hundred per visit.

So for a place offering just a modest menu of hot dogs & a drink, to chicken bake, pizzas, smoothies & gelatos, Costco Food Court is a food service operation that small mom & pop's restaurants can easily be envious of. Now that's saying a lot!

Oh, the line moves fast. You can also add items from the food court as you are paying for all the goodies in the checkout line & head straight to the pickup window.  2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"If you're at Costco and you're anything like me you're definately hittin up the food court on your way out. The food is is good, not great and cheap as anythin. .50 cent drinks 1.50 polish sausage and drink. There's ice cream, sandwiches pizza and gelato. 
If you have 5 bucks and needed yourself a good meal costco food court doesn't disappoint. The only negative I would assign them is that they're cash only"}
{"text":"When I shop at Costco I always build up a thirst. Those aisles are crazy big! After checking out the most obvious thing is to visit the food court for a drink. The lines are always pretty long since this is one of the busier Costco locations in town. 

I haven't tried their food but they are quick and efficient when you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Always consist food $1.50 for hot  dog and soda add a mixed yogurt for another $1.50 call it lunch!!!!
Pizza is always tasty and for $10 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Costco Hot Dog or Polish Dog and a drink for $1.50.

How could you not be happy with their hot dog price. Sometimes we purchase a few dogs and bring them to the dbacks game.

If I don't get a dog, their pizza by the slice is also a great buy, either pepperoni or cheese is available. 

I also love the smoothies that they have.

What a great way to save money and get great tasting quick food."}
