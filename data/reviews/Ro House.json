{"text":"We shared three rolls and both had a soup. I thought the rolls were delicious and very fresh. I loved the blend of herbs. I ordered the spicy vegetarian and really enjoyed the flavour and diverse vegetables included. 

While the price is on the higher side and we are not Vietnamese food experts, we really enjoyed the meal and customer service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really sweet place, nice server/owner.  We went here because the reviews for Pho Huong were mediocre.  But the food took forever and is just OK.  The pho broth was fairly bland and single-noted- not much depth of flavour.  Black eyed pea pudding was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the neighbourhood! Fresh rolls are exactly that- made upon order (unlike some places that make them in the morning and keep them in the fridge all day). Our favourite was the Japanese pumpkin. Pho was so fresh and tasty- very clear broth which I liked compared to other broths I've had. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We tried 4 fresh rolls and a coconut juice. It was a very light meal. The grilled chicken was the standout. We also had pork and shrimp, shrimp cake and avocado. They came one at a time each with their own dipping sauce, 3 distinct ones in total. There are beautiful photographs on the wall of Vietnamese scenes. I love fresh rolls and was happy with the variety but it was too expensive to go regularly. I might try a pho or salad next time to help fill up."}
{"text":"The rolls and pho are excellent! I had four rolls for dinner which was light but surprisingly filling at the same time. They came with some delicious sauces/dips which paired with the rolls very well. 

My girlfriend had the spicy beef pho. It was a decent sized portion, and also quite delicious. 

The staff arere very friendly and accommodating. The price was not cheap but reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. 

Definitely recommended and I will be back again soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Great rolls - the buddha roll has coconut in it, and tastes amazing. Avocado roll healthy, delicious and filling. They even sell Cafe du Monde Coffee here for around $12. Kid friendly, kitchy cute place. The bun bo hue is only one size, pretty filling, but a bit pricy. Pho is not their specialty, very simple menu, the sauce with the shrimp chips could have been better, thicker.  Family friendly place."}
{"text":"The Ro House is the latest addition to the neighbourhood. A very simple menu of Vietnamese street eats. I had the Lotus Root salad, fresh roll with Japanese pumpkin and chicken pho. All were exceptionally fresh. The lotus salad was crisp and delicious with shrimp chips on the side...shrimp chips are one of my favourite southeast Asian treats, and would be a great addition to their menu as another snack. The fresh roll was exceptional. The pumpkin was like sweet potato, but with a slightly smokier flavour. The pho was equally fresh and tasty. My only complaint is I don't like dark meat, and the chicken was mixed white and dark meat. A veggie pho option with tofu would be a great addition. 

Overall a great little spot. I look forward to working my way through their menu of fresh rolls and wish them success in the neighbourhood. Oh, and they serve real-deal Vietnamese coffee. Another of my favourites while traveling in Vietnam...I can't wait to try it at Ro House!!"}
{"text":"1-I have to agree, soup broth is BLAND. 
2-THE ONLY REASON FOR 1 STAR REVIEW... THE COST! $10 for a medium sized bowl of soup with minimal white and dark meat is ridiculous. If this was $6 it would make sense and deserve a 3 or 4 star rating, TEN BUCKS is nuts. 
3-friendly service and good wraps/rolls..
Ultimately, $30 for 1 roll and 2 smaller soups, OVERCHARGED, makes it frustrating to eat out, it's too expensive!"}
{"text":"Small, cute, cozy little place in the junction. I am Vietnamese and I hate to bash my own people - but the food is subpar and the price point is outrageous for Vietnamese food! We came on a Saturday night as a group of 4. We were hungry. We ordered a large mango salad, a large lotus salad, two x two people roll your own roll platters, a pho ga and a bun bo hue - all to share. I ordered a mango juice - but they forgot to bring it out so I just cancelled it altogether.

Portions are quite small for a \"large\" salad especially at  $10 & $12 per salad. Both salads lacking flavour, could use more fish sauce, fried onions, and herbs, and needs to be more spicy. There is only one size for both the pho ga and bun bo hue - which would be considered a standard small at most other pho restaurants - I have never ever paid more than $10 for pho or bun bo hue in my life and if I did come close to paying that much - it would be for an XXL size. Noodles were not fresh. It seems that there's not a lot of traffic through the junction so turnover of food is slower - noodles seemed old. Bun bo hue had the wrong noodles in them, not spicy enough, and was missing congealed pork blood. 

Firstly, their meat selection for the roll your own roll platters were very limited. Pork or tofu. The biggest disappoint about the RYOR was the amount of meat they give you. There is more skewer than there is meat. It is the skinniest skewer I've ever seen ... when they are charging you $30 for 10 rolls - basically $3 per roll. If you go to any other authentic vietnamese restaurant in the city and they happen to offer fresh roll aka banh hoi platters - they give you a lot of meat, veggies, and noodles and will cost no more than $13 and you will be stuffed! We basically paid over $100 for vietnamese appetizers - and we were still hungry. Maybe if Ro House was situated in Yorkville then I could understand why it was so expensive for vietnamese food - ie/ the rent is high. But not for the Junction. We felt ripped off. The 4 of us were still so hungry after that we immediately went down the street to cafe pho nho (@ dundas west and howard park) and had our second dinner there. 

This place is geared towards caucasian customers - who will pay more for subpar vietnamese food. If you want the real deal go to a viet restaurant that is actually busy - go to Pho Linh, Cafe Pho Nho, or Pho Tien Thanh...or any pho spot at St Clair and Old Weston Rd."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh as it could be . Most vietnamese places in Toronto I find have subpar rolls. These here are incredible . Perfect blend of herbs , love them

Great little spot , sweet people!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by some of the positive reviews for this place. We had high hopes for Ro House after seeing some pictures online from BlogTO. Ten weeks ago we went for an early dinner that ended up being a big disappointment. The food was expensive for what you get and totally lacked flavor. We ordered Goi Ngo Sen, Lotus Root Salad, and a RYOR platter with Nem Nuong, grilled ground pork skewers. The salad was overpriced and fell short of expectations. It was missing the aromatic flavor from thai basil and Vietnamese coriander, rau ram. The Nem Nuong, grilled ground pork skewers, were missing the essential garlicky kick and the peanut sauce that accompanied it was absolutely bland. Save your money and head to Cuu Long Mien Tay if you want to try flavorful authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is not the typical Vietnamese no frills restaurant you'll find in any neighbourhood. If you're looking for cheap pho or broken rice, this is probably not the place to go. 

The food here is cooked to the regional style of Hue, where some of the best foods of Vietnam comes from.  It's slightly on the higher end for smaller portions, but who says Vietnamese food has to be cheap? 

We ordered the spicy beef noodles soup (bun bo hue) and it was delicious. The aromatic flavours of beef broth, lemongrass, crushed peppers and cilantro will make you fall in love with this not as popular beef soup to pho. 

My favourite though was their rice pudding with black eye peas.  What makes it special is the crackle texture in the gluttonous rice, which cannot be found anywhere in Toronto! 

Ro House is a special gem, and I look forward to returning!"}
