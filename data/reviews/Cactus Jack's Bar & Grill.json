{"text":"We just saw Marmalade Skies play here last night.  We showed up early to grab one of the last tables. Fans of the band showed up in full-force. It was SRO early in their set. They sounded great !   The service, however, was below par. It seemed as if the place wasn't  prepared for the crowd that the band would bring in, even though the band played there about a month ago! We ended up waiting for the server to check on us more than once while we sat with water & drinks completely drained. If we hadn't been there specifically for the band, it's very likely we would have gone some where else.   No condiments brought out for the sliders. No small plates brought out with the nachos deluxe which were nothing special. The sides of ranch we ordered didn't arrive either. The fries that came with the Real Deal Philly Rib Eye were soggy. Their Wings are the reason for 3 stars. I had the Honey Hot  wings grilled and they were DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Fun divey bar with great music that are in all the time. We saw a Grateful Dead cover band on a Sunday afternoon and the were really good! Cover was kind of a pain, but I get it when you get live music."}
{"text":"Looking for casual \"dive type\" yet clean?  Great place here!  Mind you, when I say \"dive\" -to me this term is a positive, endearing term that means friendly people with a \"local's\" feel.  Friday nights typically consist of some really great bands; and Sat. nights for poker --free play, no buy in!  Although -the 7pm start is the more die-hard serious players...the 10 p.m. start seems more laid back by this time and this is the round where I jump in with my less than stellar knowledge of poker and just want to have some fun interaction!  The staff is really great --they are who they are and don't pretend to be anyone else --I love interecting with the \"real\" personalities of the staff and the patron's all interact easily whether they know you or not.  When you order a drink -treat the staff like a friend you just met -and not \"wait staff\" -they will remember you and appreciate that you recognize they are working hard for you and everyone around you!  A very friendly local's hang out --so whether you are from North Phoenix or out of state vacationing -visit this place for a friendly interaction with the locals -casual atmosphere with all walks of life -great pool playing and people watching on any night!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! I love that this place is so homey. The new music venue is awesome. Great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Best place ever.  Best food.  Compliments ro the chef.  Waitress was awesome. Will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"This place is dank. Smells like a bar that's been here for 50 years - you can still smell the cigarette smoke. Service is ok. They allow dogs on the patio. Prices aren't very good for a notorious dive bar."}
{"text":"Got here at 4 pm on a Sunday and some idiot on a stool told me it was $7 to get in. I said why?  He said there is a band. I said I don't hear any band. He said they start at 530. I laughed and said F off. Owner should know she lost income thanks to this asshole who seems to think he owns the place"}
{"text":"I have to say, the new food they have is great!!  Everything I've had so far has had wonderful spices and presentation. No complaints in that department. It would be nice if the staff knew what was on the menu and could recommend something. I understand it's a new menu, but think they should know what's on the menu and their opinion would help since the menu is very diverse.  As far as service goes, less chat and more attention to customers that are not \"regulars\".  Servers are walking past without asking if you would like anything. They are friendly, I give them that. It's a work in progress, but getting there."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to watch football and stumbled on cactus jacks. What a find, we had a great time sitting at the bar, watched golf until game time.the food and service were both good. We had a pizza, 1/2 Hiwian 1/2 spicy shrimp, both halves were delicious, although it took quite a while, we noticed everyone's food took a while. But we weren't in a hurry. The most fun part about the place is, the employees seemd to know everyone by name. Very friendly."}
{"text":"1st of all they charge you $10 to get in the door and then charge you $5 a beer. After buying one round, paying a tip, and cover I was out 30 bucks. I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I go and hangout with a bunch of great people on Sunday evenings. The Noodles play Grateful Dead songs. The drinks are cold and the service is awesome. It so nice to hangout and dance. Everyone is awesome."}
{"text":"It's a good old fashion hole in the wall dive bar.  I come here mostly with my parents sometimes, it sure has an older crowd vibe. Jacks' food is mediocre, I just always stick to a burger and fries, (the fries their grow on you) can't go wrong. Drinks are priced well.  They even have live music and poker nights on the weekends.   Jacks is a good bar to come with your friends after work. Very nice staff and management."}
{"text":"We love going here!  Lots of tvs to watch football!!!  The place is always clean and the service is fast and friendly.  Happy hour all day - need I say more?  The food is good and they have a different special every day.  They also have poker a couple nights a week and you can win gift certificates to spend there.  The recently completed an outdoor area so you can smoke and drink outside.  They also have live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Been to the place a couple times now...staff is OK other than a few people who take bar conversations more seriously than customers...but I digress.  Prices are a little steep for what's considered a \"dive bar\".  As far as a live band venue goes, young bands may want to stick with the either known or upcoming scenes in tempe.  Chances are, if you play at cactus, you or your friends may get in a random fight with a drunk regular but that's what the bar is.  Its a local, regular patrons only dive bar.  Just my advice and overall feedback."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Good beer.  Come by on sundays to see The Noodles. Bands are almost all tribute bands and there is a cover for them but they tend to be really good so just pay up and have some fun. Unless of course you remember paying 7 dollars to see Pink Floyd and still fit into that shirt just relax."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I came here on Super Bowl Sunday to watch the game.  Great atmosphere, fun staff. I also came on Saturday with my mom and a friend and we had a wonderful time.  The happy hour is great and i'm sure i will be visiting again :)"}
{"text":"Cacuts Jacks was closed for a while, but it is up and running once again.  Total dive bar in Ahwatukee, it is never my first choice, however a few of my friends love to go there for the cheap drinks and music (live or juke box).  I have never tried any thing to eat at Cactus Jacks, and I don't plan on it anytime soon.  Cacuts Jacks isn't really the kind of bar to start out the night, however we have been known to finish our night there, usually when Happy Hour at Brad's Places goes a little long, or when we're headed back to the tuke from some other event and don't want to stop the drinking fun!  When we do end up going there, or even suggesting \"How about Cactus Jacks?\", the rest of the group knows that the night just went from a rank of mild intoxication, to \"might as well call a cab now!\"  Crazy things have happened at Cactus Jacks, lots of good stories and foggy memories."}
{"text":"I feel like I died and went to burger HEAVEN! Went for first time craving a really good burger after playing a round of golf, and golf buddy suggested this place.   Arrived around 3:30 to a pretty dark sports bar that isn't even trying for ambiance, but set up well for the live music on weekends.   I won't lie, I didn't have a good first impression, but the staff were great and when they explained that the chef's family has a butcher shop and the meat is ground fresh, the buns are home made and fries made fresh... you've got to give that a try, for sure!   I had the Phoenix burger and golf buddy had the classic and they were both AMAZING! My fries were cut thick and I savored every hot-crispy-fresh bite!  The servers were great, beer ice cold and food was in the top-5 EVER from a sports bar! We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here thinking they served dinner, found out at the door there was a $10.00 per person cover charge. We told the door attendant that we wanted to try it for dinner, and didn't plan on staying for the band, so e let us in for free. Very nice! He told us they had good food, and to give it a try, becuase we were going to go elsewhere when it looked more like a club than a place to eat. We started off with drinks, and our sever was the absolute worst!! She was enjoying socialing with all her co-workers as they were coming on for her shift. At one point we waited about 15 minutes for my husband's second beer, she claimed the bar tender lost ticket, but we saw her putting our order in when she realized she forgot about us. It took 20 minutes for one order of previously frozen chicken strips, with fries. I do have to say the fries were great! We have no idea what took so long on the food since no one seemed to be ordering food, they were all drinking, and our server didn't have any of the large tables. My suggestion is keep an eye on the paying customers and stop focusing so much on the staff that is being paid to work. Not sure where management was, but they were no where to be found out on the floor."}
{"text":"Decent food here. Recently  the entertainment has been downgraded. They used to have established bands that fit the demographic of the area. We used to have a great night out listening to very good bands here. Now, they have two or three bands per night. Typically, they are quite a bit younger and a good fit for a college area. It is  typically bands just starting out, not established valley bands.  This downgrade came with a cover charge. So, most of the locals and regulars no longer go here for their music  fix. Our friends that used to be regulars found new venues, we have also. This is a decent place to grab a beer and watch a ball game. It is not a good place for live music any longer, that is a shame."}
{"text":"Always a good time a Cactus Jacks! The veggie tacos are the best, as are the whiskey sours!"}
{"text":"Nice place where its all about atmosphere!! The service is fast and courteous, not a fan of the cover but it worth it."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's kind of a dive bar.  Fun environment, lots of tvs, decent eats, good drink prices and a jukebox or live music depending on the night.  Who says you can't love a dive bar?  I do.  If I still lived in Tukee I'd likely be there WAY too often."}
{"text":"Fuck Cactus Jacks!!! sideways gouging 10$ cover charge for some low rent shit band thats never made a record or made it out of the valley playing shitty covers shit food Dont ever come here on a band night which is every night."}
{"text":"Marmalade Skies, a Beatles cover band, was playing at Jack's last night.  The cover charge was a bit much at $10 for this particular venue.  But it's all good, my friend is in the band.  The crowd was a mixed of older and young Beatles fans.  It was a full house.  The place seem decent and the service was good.  In fact, I was told it's gotten much better since it went under new management cause it didn't feel too divey.  It resembled a legitimate restaurant/bar.  I only ordered drinks so I can't say much about the food.  However, I don't know if I'll come back for the food, but definitely for the band."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here. For some reason I tend to end up here... That's a good thing.. Tomorrow Walt Richardson will be here awesome...530 to 730 this place has a fun and casual environment."}
{"text":"This place has great drinks, very affordable and great live music. We went here twice during our vacation and both times the food and drinks were both good. Very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This venue is fantastic, the hummus is delicious, I really wanted to order more but could not the attention of the waitress. The place was not busy but I am sure if I knew the whole story I would understand."}
{"text":"The single star goes for our waitress who made sure that my salad was dry and that it was the only vegan thing on the menu (with the edits I made).   This bar is DIRTY. It's a dive bar, but I've been in way cleaner ones. The floors are gross, bathrooms aren't even truck stop worthy, and it reeks like smoke.   I'm afraid of eating my salad and wondering what I'll catch. It's honestly not somewhere I will ever come back. I came on a Thursday for lunch, and there were many guys at the bar, but otherwise it was empty. Perhaps people already knew what I found out today... that this place is not a great one.   Oh - and their three salads aren't vegan. I had to construct my own.   Not easy. Not clean. Not awesome."}
{"text":"Came here to check out a local band (it is a friend of a friend).. Great happy hour prices. Fun environment. Seems like a great \"local bar\" type place.. I don't live nearby, so I am not sure I will return, but if I lived in Ahwatukee, I would probably be a regular there."}
{"text":"This venue is great for local musicians.  They have an awesome sound guy.  A back stage area for the bands.  Loading from the rear of the building.   And they pay pretty good too.  Very cool venue."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Definitely for an older crowd. My wife and I went here with some friends for the first time about a month ago, and I was not impressed. The food was eh and the live music was eh, it was more entertaining to watch the older people just dancing to the music."}
{"text":"Why would a bar concept host a line dancing concept that a) brings in people that don't spend money, b) is so loud it drives paying customers out and c) allows the line dancing host the right to override staffs measures to keep people there?  One of the servers turned down the volume at the sound system control board and the host turned it up on her end.  This place has a bad reputation for being loud on many nights when they have various activities.  I would rather spend my time conversing with my friends on the patio but, it's getting too hot.  New venue in the same plaza opening up in July.  Hope it is better!!"}
{"text":"Went to listen to some live music. I was really, really impressed with Ruca. I stayed longer than I had planned because the band, Ruca, was so great. I was delightfully surprised at how good the food was! The service was great and our server was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were delicious and potent. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Booze Selection:  For what appears to be a small little bar on the outside, they have a pretty decent beer selection.  They are approximately 8 or so on tap.  They have stocked bar from stuff that hobos would buy to top shelf booze.  Their bottled beer selection wasn't half bad either.  8 out of 10.  Customer Service:  While the place was packed, the bartenders are pretty nice and friendly.  They didn't go out of there way to make people feel welcomed or anything else, but were more than nice enough for me to come back.  8 out of 10.  Prices:  Beer is pretty reasonable.  I didn't try any hard alcohol, but if I was going back and had a DD, I would go with the mini-pitchers.  They were just a buck or more than the pint and probably were double the volume.  Not a bad deal!  I didn't see any crazy deals or happy hours out there. 8 out of 10.  Atmosphere: It was pretty lively when I was there.  Talking with a couple other patrons, they say the host bands every once in a while.  There are a decent amount of pool tables and the juke box wasn't playing crap music.  The crowd seems to be pretty chill and not that type to stir up shit.  However, the group of people there seemed to be more middle aged and blue collard, which is not my scene.  7 out of 10.  Overall:  I would come here again with the guys.  Its a great place if you are not into the Old Town or Mill Ave scene.  31 out 40, 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is the bar where you walk in with $25 bucks and walk out not remembering the night. A true classic dive bar! Good times, which is usually based on who you are with."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks no complaints no raves. Consistent so far, I do wish on karaoke nights it wasn't so loud. That's about it though."}
{"text":"Went to Cactus Jack's last night to see the Shammy's.... a favorite band of ours.  It's a good fun venue.  The restaurant has changed in the last 6 months.  My wife and I had a SUPER sirloin burger.  As we were eating we turned to each other and agreed that it was the best burger we had ever had (and we've been around for a long time).  Even the brioche rolls were made on site.  We asked to talk with the chef (Sonny) and tell him how much we enjoyed the food.  He's doing a great job.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. The Guinness was properly poured but not served in a traditional pint glass. That's as good as it gets. I sat at the bar and had lunch. I tried to have lunch anyway. I regularly had to fight off the aggressive flies. The burger was ok. Hard to taste  the beef through all the seasoning though. Leads one to believe the product is of lesser quality. The fries were fresh cut but not double fried leaving them quite soft with no crunch.  Jack's is probably a good neighborhood drinking hole. Don't expect anything more than cold beer and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been working pretty much all day long cleaning the apartment of our friend who died unexpectedly. It was around the time of what should be happy hour, about 10 people in the place and nobody was attempting to order from the bartender. I was at the end of the bar she looks up and keeps stacking glasses, no hello, no acknowledgement at all  So i walked down to where she was and asked if she had what my friend wanted to drink, to which she replied\" no, we don't serve THAT! like I just asked for a 40 of Olde English or something. So I ordered...or attempted to order something else...since this stack of glasses was much more extremely important than my business she cut me off..just wait a few minutes...and not kindly. I said \" yeah\" and we left. I am not going to give my money to someone or to a establishment that can't treat me with basic human respect. I wish I had this ray of sunshine's name. I didn't stay that long. I wish I could give minus stars."}
{"text":"I have never been to a bar where I've been discriminated against. I'm at a table with 6 other people and the waitress refused to take my order. Mind you, I'm not drunk at all but she got the drink order from the rest of the table and completely skipped me twice. I will never patron this place ever again and I warn anyone else of color to do the same. Racist ass waitress bitch!"}
{"text":"I'll never understand this place and the logic. They would rather try and charge me a $5 cover charge than to just let me come in and spend $30-$40 on drinks!      A cover charge? To see a crappy band?    They seem to stuck on booking tribute bands, which in my opinion is just about the worst type of band! And again, A COVER CHARGE!  Used to be a fun place with good music. Not anymore, which is sad since it's so close.  Maybe someday they'll get a clue and realize charging a cover is a losing proposition."}
{"text":"I guess if you like to always pay a ridiculous cover for washed up cover bands and limited beer selection, this is your place!  I'm currently on my third and final visit here-I've paid a cover every time for ABSOLUTELY MEDIOCRE classic rock cover bands.  Today I decided I can't possibly pay another $5-$15 each time I walk I'm here for totally unmentionable drinks, entertainment, and service. If washed up covers are your thing, this is your place. If you're less than 60, chances are you should check out Phillys, Zipps, or CK''s instead cuz this place is NOT happening!"}
{"text":"Divey, sketchy, and I don't think I'd be eating anything here but for live music or a couple of beers it's a fine place.  We were there on a night when a few bands played and there was a cover charge but that's understandable to pay the bands."}
{"text":"Drove further than normal just to hear two of my favorite bands perform Saturday 9/13/14 as did at least 15 people I knew there.   Pleasantly surprised at how clean and fresh the place was.  Didn't hesitate to pay the 7 dollar cover as I'm happy to support local artists.The stage was gorgeous!  9pm rolled around and no music.  The band was  on stage but not playing.  TV's glaring football and we were told at 9:30 that the band would begin when the football game was over. There were several other people inquiring about the music as well.  Kind of weird because the sound was not on the tv's so what would the music matter?   9:45 and finally the music began.  I'm sorry but, if they're going to advertise a new and  improved music venue, they need to choose one or the other.  Great staff and affordable drinks."}
{"text":"What kind of dark, twisted hole did I fall in to? It's all a little fuzzy. I know I danced with the devil, drank with the beast and bowed down to a minister of dark prose.  Cactus Jack's was the site of the after party for the Raider's Fan Convention recently and completely taken over by my Raider brothers and sisters. Cactus Jack's is the perfect place for such a party - it's open enough, there is a nice, wraparound patio, great seating at long tables to allow mingling and getting to know your Raider family. The stage allows for acts to do their thing with a pretty large dance floor. Drinks weren't overpriced and servers kept things hopping. I wish I could say that I sampled the menu but it was all about the draannk that night.  So yes, I danced with the devil (about 100 of them while the band did their thing), drank with a beast (bellied up to the bar with super fans Gorilla Rilla and Violator and toasted some celebratory things in the future) and bowed down to a minister of dark prose (my fiancé took the stage and threw down some rap).  And I had the BEST TIME!!!!  Keep the parties comin' Cactus Jack's - we'll be there!"}
{"text":"If you like going to bars to watch the game. Not be over crowded or bothered and get great prices this is the place for you. I love it!"}
{"text":"Cactus jacks is bar food but is pretty cheap with good service. If you're looking for a place to watch the game and have a beer it is a good spot"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly place to have some entertainment.  The dance floor is great."}
{"text":"The music and sound system - GREAT, gets 5 stars.  I like the nice openness of the bar and the door can be open for fresh air.   The wait staff are hard to tell from the patrons.  Service, on the sketchy side, you would be standing around waiting a long time, finally give up and get the drink at the bar yourself.  The drink I ordered was well made.  I only ordered fried zucchini, which came in steep at $7.57 with tax.  These were cut so very thin.  It was mostly a bunch of breading.  Not seven dollars worth of food there.  If you're going to charge that, please give us zucchini you can actually bite into, not imagine!  I am not sure I will be back for food, as the menu items seem high for the price for standard bar food.  As far as the previous reviewer's comment about a $10 cover charge for the Beatles band being too high, please note there are seven band members (count them, seven) . The band has to divide that all up at the end of the day, they are not taking home an enormous amount of cash.  Ten bucks is not an unreasonable cover."}
{"text":"We came for lunch. The service was great, good beer, and great menu. We had burgers and fried pickles for food. All the food is fresh and made in house. No frozen stuff here. Delicious! !! We were quite impressed. Not what you would expect for \"bar food\". One of the chefs came out introduced himself and asked us about our meal and for honest feed back. That again you wouldn't normally see in a bar. Definitely coming back. Great new kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Holy 360, I dreaded coming here in the 2016 football season, but my experience week 1 this year was as if I was in a whole diff. Place. The service was on point! The staff was friendly and attentive even with the place being absolutely packed. The old sewer smell has vanished thank you lawd jesus and although I didn't order food I was near the kitchen and did see plenty of good stuff coming out. I will def. Be back"}
{"text":"Very nice local music venue. They are a good size and have a comfortable atmosphere. I stopped in for a quick bite and their food was good. I had a chicken sandwich that was much better than expected. Not your everage bar food menu. I am coming back for more local bands and fun nights out with friends. Perhaps even for lunch."}
{"text":"This place was horrible for a last minute drink. Place was empty with a horrible band and couldn't wave a white flag to get service. They close before 2am because the bar tender said so.  Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Fun bar with great burgers. Karoke was fun. This was the first time that I saw a full band which accommodate the singers. We went back on Saturday. The 12 piece band, had horns and sultry singers. The cover was only$8. Good value. Great mature crowd."}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend to see the band noodles. Ive tried different things since I've been here and everything has been good. He staff has been generally  friendly even on when the bar is full."}
{"text":"OMG- Went to check out a band ( all good)-our waitress was awesome and I am craving the corn on the cob.. I need more !!!"}
{"text":"What are you waiting for this place has THE best food in town! BEST servers and bartenders! Not to mention live music AND happy hour!  Try the chicken alfredo!! You won't be disappointed!   They have something going on every night too! If you don't like this bar there is seriously something wrong with you! Enjoy life is too short!"}
{"text":"The first time I came in here, didn't order anything. The second time there was a band setting up and sat down at the bar. Actually had lady sit down next to me at the bar and we talked a little bit. I'd like to check out some live music next time I stop in there."}
{"text":"I like it! It's nothing crazy special, but it's a solid dive bar. I'll tell you though, the fries are some of the best I've ever had. Seriously. They have plenty of TVs for sports, a stage for live bands and they have poker and craps on Monday nights. Worth checking out."}
