{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to find good Mexican food in a casino. My boyfriend orders carne asada everywhere he goes and said that Cabo's was the best he ever had. They have a salsa bar with about 20 different varieties of salsa. I ordered a quesadilla and a margarita, both were delicious. The bartender Tina was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting. The service was even worse. I got a fajita plate and it was gross. The margaritas were too sour. Never again."}
{"text":"The hours are so weird but the food is amazing. Love that they're having 50% off deals and when the casinos send out coupons. I usually get the chimi fajita and it's wonderful. I think this one has a salsa bar which is so nice, some of the others just give you a little 3-bowl tray."}
{"text":"I ordered steak nachos. My order sat in the food window for 10 minutes after it was ready.  Then my waitress took it out from under the heat lamps and sat there for another 3 minutes gossiping about another employee while my nachos got cold on her tray. By the time I got my nachos, my steak was cold and my chips were soggy. I definitely will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"I went with my wife for dinner.  Our server does not paying attention to to us when he took our order.  My wife ordered chicken tacos and I ordered chicken burrito. For drink we both ordered water with lemon wage. The server came back right away with water no lemon.  When the food arrived, my wife got beef tacos instead of chicken. I'm not sure how it's happen but we didn't sent it back to the kitchen.  My chicken burrito was dry as a bone. This time we had to sent it back to the kitchen.  When I explained to our server that the burrito is dry and not eatable, he just picked it up in his hand and looked at it for a minute and asked me if I wanted something else instead. I ordered chicken fajita. Once again the chicken was too dry but at this point I already lost my petite.Moreover, all the side dishes were in poor quality. The rise was too try. The salsa was old like it was standing in the cooler over night. We could just go to one of the Mexican fast food restaurants and get better quality then that.  the one star up there is for the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it was Guadalajara. Granted, the food here isn't going to change the world. My husband and I are vegetarian, and we pretty much order the same thing - the Spinach Enchiladas - and they are always tasty. What sets this apart for us is the service. The wait staff nearly always recognizes us, as does the hostess who is usually there. One of our waiters even remembered our order after we hadn't been there for a couple of months (travelling over the summer). That kind of friendly atmosphere is a rare find, especially in a busy casino restaurant, and that goes a long way with me!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was ok. The food is just alright. My chicken tacos seemed a little dry. My friends tried the battered fish tacos and they said they were good, but the tater sauce was a little too spicy for their taste. The service was very good. They came back and filled our drinks without us asking which was nice. And our server had to go on break towards the end of our meal, but she let us know that someone would be taking care of us. I loved that because I've been to places and our server would just leave and not let us know. So great service here, but food was just ok."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! Come visit Diana for an amazing margarita and fantastic service!! We also tried the amazing assortment of salsa at their salsa bar for the chips.....the beans here are phenomenal too!!! COME IN AND ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Great service,  retro mex. decor, the food was good, i had the chicken fajita  good mild seasoning and big portion.  The only thing I did not like was the chicken quesadilla on the childrens menu,  it had some strong seasoning my little one did not care for."}
{"text":"Love the tacos and salsa bar- also have great bean dip and chips! Not super original but classic American Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I think they changed chefs. The last two times I have gone here the food was very disappointing. The fajitas are not what they used to be. I have stopped eating here. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"GT the bartender has the worst attitude I have ever seen at a bar. Since we sat down he has been grouchy and poor service. I don't know what his problem was but we will never come back to this the bar again."}
{"text":"Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;  Mumbly, unengaged waiter;  Clueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees on plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us perfunctorily for our patronage;  We're from the Texas Hill Country; down there, we jail critters  who serve up grub this bad, for their own protection.  Never, never, NEVER again (Back to Yard House for real food)"}
{"text":"This review is based on the bar area & bar food.  First off, I have to say that the chips & salsa were not too bad. I have been to pretty decent Mexican restaurants with worse salsa. Sooo easy to make, yet I don't get how so many places can screw it up.    Moving right along...I also had the Tapatio chicken wings, which were a little on the spicy side for me, but, they were very tasty. I would order them again, as well as recommend them.  The Bartender was quiet, but friendly & helpful. I actually ordered a Pineapple Mojito, which is a rarity for me, since I'm not a drinker, with the exception of the occasional Malibu Rum & Pineapple ;) However, the sound of Malibu Pineapple Rum in this drink kind of sealed the deal. It was quite good, actually, very refreshing too. I will also add that, I was kind of stoked from having just won $150 bucks on Caveman Keno, which probably put me into such a festive mood.  Overall, I think I might try out the actual restaurant itself, one day."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday evening, it was slow which was good for us! Food was great, price was good, service was excellent-we will be back! My only complaint is that they don't serve Dr. Pepper. This is the Cabo restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino."}
{"text":"went here the morning after i woke up from staying in palace station.  did the deal for unlimited tacos for $7.99, which you don't have to check in to get, they will give it to you anyways.  we sat at the bar, and the 2 people there were nice and pretty helpful.  we got a few drinks which they comp'd since we were playing the little video machines at the bar, and then we ordered our tacos.  service was a little slow for the food, but we didn't care because we didn't have a place to be till later that night.  you can choose between shredded beef, shredded chicken, or ground beef.  my first plate i got all 3, and the shredded beef was by far the best.  the ground beef was decent, but didn't have much flavor, and the shredded chicken was just too dry.  they bring you 3 at a time and you get it on a large plate with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and then rice and beans and you can put all of it in the tacos.  second order i got just shredded beef and they didn't bring more rice and beans, but they did offer them.  i just decided i would rather fill up on tacos than rice and beans.  overall, i probably won't be back just because i probably will not return to palace station, but if i am at palace station, ill probably stop by again"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice in the last two weeks, once on a Saturday night with family of four and on a Thursday night with just me and my wife.  We were pleased both times.  It seemed like the place was a complete 180 from most of the reviews on here.  Staff was friendly and expeditious.  Food has been hot and fresh.  I hope it continues to please our family and yours. 12/16/16"}
{"text":"We were not expecting to be wow'ed after reading the reviews but we were pleasantly surprised! We were greeting by a very nice hostess. Our waitress, Jeanette was attentive and very sweet! Our food was very good. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot over the years and it's always tasty. Fajitas are enough for lunch the next day and I enjoy trying the different kinds of margaritas. They also have a nice selection of salsas for the tortillas, so it's good when you're with others and everybody like something different. I used a free Yelp coupon here for dessert and had no problem. Just wish they were open for lunch, but I'm sure it's all about the foot traffic."}
{"text":"Went to a movie at the casino theater and decided to have a quick dinner at Cabo not expecting anything great and it's pretty difficult to mess up mexican food. Sat at the bar and the first thing that happens is we get a bartender that is by far the worst I have ever seen in 20 plus years in this town. There aren't enough words to describe this guy but RUDE is a big one among other I probably can't say here. We ordered food and drink and having to argue with him to do so then asked for our check and he just stared at us and went past us to talk to some new customers. We then had to ask the bar back to get our check. OMG this guy really needs to get fired and when we returned home and looked at the receipt there was his name GERARD. In any other situation I would not have tipped at all but thought of the other people there who deserve their share of tips so did leave something but not even close to what I would have. The food...it is what it is; Santa Fe Station Cabo food. Don't expect alot and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went to this restaurant around 4:40 p.m on 8/17 our waiter was oscar.. he was the worst not friendly person ive met in the waiting business. . Its kinda sad because im a waiter myself and he makes us look bad.. he didnt come by to refill not one drink..  disappeared when asking for him.. then when other tables came in he catered to them like we werent sitting there..  we had to walk to the hostess stand to ask for our check.. ive never went to a restaurant and not tip.. but yesterday was the first.."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a local friend around 8-8:30 PM on Tuesday, 1/19/10.   I had the Baja Carnitas (listed under specialties) and a margarita.  About 4-5 hours later I developed terrible stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea---obvious symptoms of food poisoning.  I had not eaten anything else since noon so I'm confident it was this dinner that got me.    I wasn't able to get around until about 3PM the next day.  At that time I went over to the SHOT Show to check in.  The registration person was a local who lived in the area of town near the Redrock.  After hearing my experience, she told me she spent a day in the hospital after dining at the Redrock's buffet.  This restaurant is capable of producing appetizing looking Mexican food.  However, they need to spend a lot more effort on keeping food either adequately cold or sufficiently hot.  Otherwise, food permitted to remain at room temperature too long will develop the bacteria that produce this sort of food poisoning.    I'm sending a letter to the restaurant and to the Nevada governmental entity responsible for restaurant inspections."}
{"text":"I came to Cabo for a birthday dinner and this place is great!  The salsa bar is AHHH-mazing because Cabo provides different sweet, mild, and spicy sauces.  Some examples include tomatillo avocado, pico de gallo, a sweet and spicy fruit salsa, and these hot salsas that I can't remember the names of.  They also have a refried bean sauce that helps neutralize the spices in your mouth.  I also like the fact that Cabo has a self-serve chips area so that customers don't have to ask the workers, \"Can we get more chips?\"  The carne asada burrito was definitely flavorful because the steak was marinated well and the corona-rita was smooth and buzzing.  If you come here on someone's special day, they sing and give a very large sombrero.  I'm definitely a fan and I will be back in the future!  If you enjoy Mexican food, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Just gotta be honest here... I wasn't too thrilled with Cabo this visit.  It was our 19th wedding anniversary... Went in with a party of 8 and were seated rather quickly. ..we had reservations but arrived an hour or so early... So that was nice of them to accommodate us. Three of us ordered fajitas... Which tasted great but the portions were so small! My son only had 3 strips of steak! I tasted my husbands chicken fajitas and the chicken was a little dry and flavorless...So disappointing! I usually order fajitas in other Mexican restaurants and end up taking a doggie bag home because there was just so much food... Not here!  And for the price I think they could have used more meat and veggies. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food... But just looking across the table... All I saw was small portions...but no one complained and everything looked great.  I do love the feel of Cabo though...I love how it is decorated, and the Salsa Bar is superb!  Love the margaritas too! Sunset Station is across town from us, but kind of sentimental...so We will definitely be going back to Cabo...just stating away from the fajitas."}
{"text":"Went here last night - forgot to check in (shame on me). It was edible but possibly the worst Mexican food I have had since I can remember.  nothing out of the typical enchilada, burrito, tamale category. I love a good authentic tamale as much as the next person - but you aren't finding it here. The service was prompt and they refilled our salsa a number of times so that was the only highlight. I had the tamale/chile relleno combo and hubby had the chimichanga and we switched half way through. He said his black beans were ice cold.  The chicken in the chimichanga was dry and it was soggy. Also ordered a pitcher of house margarita - $22, and it was pretty weak. It was suprisingly busy in there but mostly the older crowd.. I liked one of the salsas and the service was okay but other than that I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. We were very disappointed that they had a sign up that said margarita pitcher special ask bartender. We asked our waitress and she didn't know anything about it. We ordered a pitcher of watermelon margarita's thinking it was going to be some kind of special. It was. It was $36.00 for a pitcher that had no alcohol in it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of several restaurants located inside the Red Rocks Casino, Cabo was a busy place on a recent evening.  There was a small line forming for entry, but this line was fast-moving and everyone was seated within a few minutes.    The restaurant itself was long and narrow, with a very nice den area that is complete with a fireplace.  TV's are spaced out along the walls and air your favorite sporting events.  The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the ones I spoke with seemed very knowledgeable about the casino itself.  Both food and drink here were stellar.  I expected this to be run-of-the-mill Mexican food but was pleased to find the beef fajitas especially flavorful with a subtle hint of line to them.  Their marinade must have been excellent.  The margaritas were all top-notch, though they tended towards the expensive side.  As the evening progressed, the wait staff was pressed fairly thin.  My waitress was working many tables and was tied up for a good amount of time.  When it came time to order another beverage, I merely asked a manager who was walking by and he stopped what he was doing to field my order.  The waitress appeared shortly thereafter and was apologetic, but clearly this was not her fault, she was doing the best she could on a night when the staff was stretched thin.  I did mention this to the manager on the way out and he was very receptive.  I consider that a good sign.  All in all, this is a great way to get quality Mexican food in a fine atmosphere at fair prices.  One can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"The only reason we came here were for the all you can eat enchiladas. It was OK. When we arrived at the restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino, we were told it was a 15 minute wait even though there were plenty of empty tables. Our little buzzer didnt even alert us that our table was ready, someone just randomly came out from the other side of the restaurant and sat us. We got the chips and salsa and bean dip 5 minutes later which was delicious. Our waiter came to get our drink order at super fast speed and then disappeared for a while. It seems that EVERY time he came to our table, he was finding an excuse to leave our table--as if he was rushing to be somewhere else even though there was no one else in the restaurant except 2 people at the bar (it was a monday night). Maybe they were short staffed and he was the cook also?!?!? who knows because it wasnt explained. Anyway, the enchiladas were pretty good, they make you order a fountain drink as a condition of getting the all you can eat though. They bring out all three for the first course, beef, cheese and chicken. After that you order as you finish your current enchilada. They dont let you take it to go but they do let you take it home if you're too full. My husband ordered the chimichungas and he said they were really really good. I would go back again for the enchiladas, even though the service was very odd."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here, the chicken suizas are fabulous.  They bring out chips with a variety of salsa, all very good.  Try the table side guacamole, very good stuff.  For dessert, the apple churros are to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pork tamale I have ever eaten!  Love the salsa bar.  I ate dinner there before a show and went back the next day to get another one of those great tamales but...unfortunately they are closed for lunch.  I tried the Palace Station but alas, no tamales there.  Please open for lunch!!!  I love your tamales!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at this restaurant a few times and this past experience was very disappointing.  The service was delayed and the food was horrible.  We were served the chips and salsa right away when we were seated and our waiter captured our beverage orders in a timely fashion.  I ordered the veggie fajitas and bf asked if he could order a burrito with veggies, black beans and cheese.  No problem, order was submitted and beverages were being consumed.    Our food arrives...my fajitas were sizzling but the flavor and seasoning was lacking and the vegetables were really raw, like they might have made contact with the grill top for a minute or two before being transferred to the cast iron plate.  There were corn kernels in the mix and they were stale and chewy like they had been sitting out awhile.  Bf's burrito was a disaster.  Inside he found an obscene amount of cheese and a couple traces of vegetables.  The beans were served on the side rather than as requested.  When the cheese congealed together he wasn't able to eat any more because of the texture.   This is when we dissected it looking for the morsels of vegetables.  By now, our drinks were empty but we couldn't see our waiter so we just waited so we could pay and leave.  We also noticed the other tables in our area were not being attended too.  One table had to sit and look at their food sitting on the server's tray wondering if they should just get up and put it on the table themselves.  A large group behind us commented about their lack of beverages after they had been seated for quite a while.  It seemed odd to me because the restaurant was full of staff and maybe only 60% full of customers.    If management reads this, please consider making your bean dip and rice without lard and chicken stock. For those of us that are vegetarian/vegans we would really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Above average in taste & presentation, which is unusual for a casino location. Flavors and sauces are really good."}
{"text":"Its Sad that the Santa FE bartender is bringing Cabo restaurant down. GT is the worst and most disrespectful bartender  I have ever met. never ever going their again till I see him gone and out of Santa Fe.  Save your time and money don't bother wasting it their.  Station Casinos don't care they spit in your face everyday and laugh about it quick to turn it on you and act like their the victims & your the bad guy. Garbage food Garbage pay outs Garbage service.  Thanks for the horrible experience all around in every Station Casinos. Even Staff tells me try elsewhere try the strip where they really love locals."}
{"text":"Some Cabo restaurants are great and others are mediocre. The one inside Santa Fe is mediocre. I remember it being so much better a few years ago. The service is great but the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"A group of 14 of us date here one evening during our last visit.  Service was a little slow, but not terrible.  Food was pretty good, but not outstanding.  Nice change if you're staying at Red Rock for many nights, but I prefer Terra Rosa, T-Bones or Yardhouse, so probably won't make it back here very often."}
{"text":"Except for the drinks, The Happy Hour menu is YUK!  The tacos (mini), enchiladas, and quesadillas make Taco Bell and Del Taco look good. People are very nice, but the food is crap!. Don't know about their regular menu, but can't believe it's any better. Can't say you haven't been warned."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ok not authentic but they try! The prices are really reasonable and the portions were on the larger side. Everyone we came across from the bartender to the bussers were super nice. We got a whole margarita pitcher, 3 entrees and 2 appetizers for $60 some odd dollars. Well worth it! They also have a salsa bar you can graze over!"}
{"text":"While the manager was very receptive and understood our complaints, I don't think I'll ever go back to this restaurant.  - There was a large piece of rolled up paper BAKED INTO my boyfriend's enchilada. This was the deal breaker. - One of the key drinks on the happy hour list was a mojito, and the bartender didn't know how to make one, or maybe just forgot to add 1/3 of the ingredients. - My friend ordered a margarita that tasted terrible. - Their fish dinner was actually pretty tasty. - The staff had no idea what they were doing. They misunderstood several things on a number of occasions. -My boyfriend had to ask for a glass of water three times only to have it arrive after about 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Well, I must say we are frequent visitors of CABO because of thier fajitas.  Usually pretty consistent.  We've had a few issues over the years but nothing that wasnt fixed.  Over the last couple weeks we have been twice and seen a rapid decline in thier customer service.  Last Saturday night around 10pm (time may have been a problem), we walked in and either intrerupted employee's discussion at the bar because either they were laughing at their convo or laughing at us.  Immediately we felt awkward walking in.  Only a few tables had people being that it was a little on the late side.  We were served some stale chips and salsas which we had some of while we waited for our drink order or dinner order for that matter-which never happen.  Apparently it was social hour amongst the Cabo staff because after 20 minutes of waiting for someone we looked around in sloooow motion (like in a movie) and the employees were in multiple areas chit chatting instead of taking care of their customers.  We waited a few more minutes and were so disgusted that we left and went somewhere else for a late night dinner.  :( big bummer.  Now LAST NIGHT, we were seated around 7pm Friday night...the place was pretty busy.  We were served our STALE chips with all the crumbs at the bottow.  Seems like a usual....hm.  The salsa a little watered down.  BTW I must say BF very disappointed that the salsa verde is not being served anymore.  :(  Anyways, our server Colleen - has worked there so long....and has lost her luster.  She looked so worn down and was not happy to be there at all....barely talked to us.  I rememember when she first started to work there she had a pep in her step....not anymore. :(  Anyways, regardless of the chips and salsa and service....our fajitas were good.....on a happy note.  I do love amazing chips and salsa though..thats part of going to a mexican restaurant.....that they dont have anymore.  1 star on the chips and salsa, 2 stars on service and 3 stars on the fajitas (still not deserving 3 stars).....all to leave a little desired for being the BEST place to work in Las Vegas~Station Casinos. ;)  Customer service is key Mr. Fratita!"}
{"text":"The Verde sauce was delicious! !! The chicken enchiladas and chicken tamales were really tasty and the margaritas were on point!"}
{"text":"Stay away from here. I spent $14.00 for a margarita in the rocks with salt because if a shot if gran mariner.  sucks very commercialized. 1 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"To be seated didn't take very long, the place was pretty empty. After ordering our food with our waiter, Oscar, who had no personality whats so ever. When we asked what kind of drinks they had he said Pepsi products, I asked if he had tea, he said yes, when I asked if it was sweetened or unsweetened tea, his response to me was \"its tea!\"  We waited FOREVER for our food. No one came by to advise us what was taking so long nor asked if we needed anything. We have NO idea why it was taking so long, it wasn't like the place was busy or anything.  They had no kids menu and the beverages weren't even listed on the menu. Food was pretty good, and the salad ranch dressing was delicious, but because of our extremely long waiting and our rude waiter, we'll never come here again."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! love the happy hour there ... mon-fri 4-630pm ($3/$4/$5) food menu, and you get good options in food, not all of it is fried like most places. The drink specials during happy hour are great too! my fav is $3 shock tops! great atmosphere, decent service, and come hungry! free chips and salsa before you eat!"}
{"text":"My Husband had the steak fajitas and I had the chicken, absolutely delicious, this was our first time going their, we will definitely be returning, very good food and service."}
{"text":"Upon arriving I was greeted by a not so friendly host. She was boring and barely made eye contact. There was a 10 min wait and half of the restaurant had tables. When we were seated all went well. The bussers do not do such a great job they have tables to clean for over 10 mins they left sitting there. The waiter was okay nothing special quite honestly all the waiters weren't that special seems as if they hire randoms with no clue of customer service or personality. This place lacked friendliness. The one at Santa Fe is way better if you're in that area go there. There's Hispanic people who know the cuisine one, two they're friendly, and three they seem to have customer service experience. All in all the food was good. Service was poop. Thanks tho"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  The chips were super cheap and salty.  I ordered chicken tamales which were so dry I could hardly swallow them.  Vegas doesn't have very good Mexican restaurants to begin with, but this was pretty bad.  The service was not very good for a Mexican restaurant, usually they are super fast and efficient.  I will definitely never come here again!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Cabo. My girlfriend brought me here for one of her Yelp events.   We had unlimited margaritas- which was amazing. They were so good! Who doesn't love free margaritas on a Wednesday afternoon!   They had amazing salsa, and their chips were not too salty. I loved their guacamole, which I am pretty particular about (it definitely was not like Roberto's goop of what they call guacamole out of a bag).   We had a great time! We sat outside by the fire, and met great people. The staff was really friendly and funny, which was a surprise since most restaurants have okay service. Overall it was a great success, and I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Motown Review at Santa Fe Station last week and had dinner at Cabo prior to the show. I was amazed at the customer service! These folks are fast and engaged. Chips and 3 types of Salsa and drinks at our table within 5 min. I had the crispy tacos, they were sooo good! My husband was very happy with his meal as well. Can't wait to go back! What a great neighborhood establishment!!! The Hostess on duty, I think her name was Katherine, she was definitely customer oriented. She made sure everybody was happy and stopped to chat for a few minutes. I love this place! Thanks for making our night so special!!!"}
{"text":"The chips were delicious, very warm and fresh! The bean dip was great as well as the strawberry mojito! The place was warm and had a very relaxing vibe. A good place to just hang out. But that's about it, the food wasn't that great kind of dry and boring. Not too impressed :/"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant.  The strawberry marg was candilicious.  All our entrees were fresh, and of generous portions.  Service was not bad at all.  We were seated in the main dining area, as you walk in, but we took a peek to the back and noticed a nice \"party room\", where the windows open to the exterior.  Even has a nice fire place/pit. I got excited and enquired about having a party there, asking if it was ok to bring a cake.  The hostess advised that there would be a minimum cake cutting fee of $25, regardless of whether we cut it, or they did.  YIKES!  Hence, 4 instead of 5 stars.   Any one want to put their 2 cents about this??  We were at the Yardhouse for another party, and no cakeage nonsense there.  Hmmmm...."}
{"text":"Went there about 2 weeks ago and it was lame. I like the chips and salsa though. Service is not great, not good either. Our server this time was this woman with thick makeup and she is just slow and lacking in customer service. The food is ok, not bad but not really good either."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Esther was wonderful. Our fajitas were delicious and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow. The blonde manager was also very attentive and present with the guests."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. I went as a guest with a friend who had a comp for here or the Italian restaurant. She was not impressed wth the Italian option so we opted this location.  There was no wait and they were not busy. The server initially brought chips and invited us to the salsa bar. He brought drinks and table side guacamole promptly, which was the last good portion of this dinner.  Several patrons who sat down after we did were served food before we were.  We asked about our food several times, when we could find the server, and he was seemingly unapologetic and nonplussed about a significant delay in excess of 45 minutes. We had relatively simple items and although my food came out got, my companion's food was lukewarm. Neither dish was well seasoned and the rice that accompanied it was dry and tasteless.  They got the order wrong but by then, we just wanted to finish and move on with the evening.  Hilariously, we are there as invited guests of the casino and you'd assume they want us served quickly so we can get back to why they really want us there. I won't be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there last night in hopes of finding some decent Mexican Food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all, the service was lacking. It took us asking twice to just get a container of salt to the table. Also, the waitress was less than interested in helping us with anything more than taking our order.   Second, the food was atrocious. You know you have an issue if you need to add salt to Mexican food. The rice was dry (almost hard and old) and completely tasteless. The beans were bland and tasted like paste. There was barely any cheese in the enchilada I had. My husband's tacos wee haphazardly put together, falling over and impossible to pick up, and needless to say did not taste good.   The only saving grace was the shredded beef burrito and the Tomatillo-Avocado salsa. No, I will not be going back, even with the Yelp offer."}
{"text":"Disorganized and over priced!! This restaurant is definitely one of the worst places we have experienced in Las Vegas. The staff and management here are completely incompetent and confused. The food is not great (Roberto's is even more authentic) and the service is SO slow.  Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"What used to be a great place for dining/socializing after work has been turned into a desolate hole in the wall tucked neatly in the back corner of the Casino? Just turn it into another \"Oyster Bar\" and move on."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had went here on Tuesday night for dinner. We got sat very quickly. But, out waiter took roughly 5 minutes to even come by our table. The bus lady had to come and get our drink order. By the time our waiter, William had stopped by our table we were ready to order. Food came fairly quick. Not once did he come by and ask us how our food tasted. My fiance ordered the platter and I ordered the Carne Asada burrito. My burrito was too dry to eat. When he finally came by to see if we wanted dessert, I told him I wasn't fond of the burrito because it was dry. Thinking he was going to take it off the bill, since I only took about 3 bites out of it. He didn't even attempt anything. Drinks were only filled once. Just a bad experience overall.   The only good thing about the restaurant was that the manager was ALWAYS out on the floor. Wish she would have stopped by after we got our food. But, she was really busy!."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Good drinks decent food although I don't care for the rice at all. All the servers are prompt and friendly, I come here often"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but how can you screw up mexican??  In the end, it wasn't anything special either.  I had the quesadilla one time and enchilada's another.  They have an OK happy hour but with YardHouse next door, who's gonna come here unless you want to gamble or can't get a seat in YH?  They did turn off the TV's while I was watching 15 min. before close so I wasn't impressed with the staff..."}
{"text":"Grear food, service must improve, we asked for syrup for our french toast... never got it, we keep asking for coffee when they suppose to bring it to us."}
{"text":"AMAZING Mexican food. Awesome service. We always asked for the same server each time. I'm so bummed that she left!  The guacamole, fajitas, margaritas and burritos are ALL incredibly tasty and packed with flavor. It's on the pricier side of Mexican food, but I feel like we paid a fair price. They have a prickly pear margarita that you HAVE to try!"}
{"text":"I recently met for drinks and dinner here.  As a previous viewer stated, \"mediocre\" would be the order of the day.  It was fairly priced, and the food was decent, as was the service.  Beyond that, there was nothing special or extraordinary about it.  That's not to say it was bad, simply not memorable.  If you happen to be in the Sante Fe Station Casino, and are looking for a safe, cookie cutter, Mexican Restaurant... this would be a safe bet."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, but I've been here multiple times now and each time have received excellent service and food."}
{"text":"This food is just bad. Fish tacos taste fishy. Carne Asada taste of cheap seasoning. Red rice and beans were mediocre. I felt bad for the customers coming in, wanted to tell them not to waste their money. Our waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Thought this was thee exact same as thee one the have at thee #boulderstation casino n I'd order a shrimp steak burrito. Unfortunately it was not menu for food was very slim n could be revised some. As for alcoholic beverages there was a nice selection but i wanted to enjoy a nice burrito in short decided  to settle for thee boneless wings (spicy garlic parmesan n another flavor which was pose to b spicy neither were fries were thee highlight of the meal so i ordered another rd. Thee strawberry lemonade bartender made were good... Although she did try n charge me twice for thee same meal?!? All in all experience was ok prolly wouldn't go back because of the short menu"}
{"text":"Service, service, oh silly service. It was greatly lacking at Cabo.   After ordering our drinks, I swore our waitress had hit it big because she was no where to be found. 20 minutes passed and finally she did return with said drinks that had been sitting at the bar, and then proceeded with taking our order.   Maybe we just came on a bad night, it was karaoke night after all and I hadn't yet had enough drinks to enjoy the karaoke that was ensuing. Not to mention the DJ, well I'll just be nice and say he enjoyed hearing himself talk and needed to come down off the high cloud he was on.   The food arrived, again at a much slower than normal pace. It was mediocre at best, no one at my table had finished their order. Sadly cant even remember what I ordered, the experience here was just not up to par."}
{"text":"A friend of a very good friend recommended we try Cabo's yesterday, Saturday.  I generally don't eat to much Mexican food but I wanted some place new and we were out shopping and needed a lunch break.  I wasn't to impressed and my friend shared those same thoughts. I don't like to be critical but the food was drab and the service was very low energy.  We had to ask for almost everything like tableware, water and extra napkins."}
{"text":"Met a friend for Dinner and it was an ok experience. The positive is the hostess came to us at the bar across the way to let us know our table was ready. Our waitress was pretty attentive. The only draw back on service was that it took them awhile to bring us some silverware. We ordered and as we were waiting we hit the chip and salsa bar. There was no chips but crumbs. We had to wait for that. The salsa bar was pretty messy. After going up a second time you would hope they cleaned it up. No, it was still messy. The salsa was pretty good. A good selection to choose from from very mild to hot. Well, what they think is hot lol. More like spicy ketchup. The menu was ok. Very pricy for the types of selections to choose from. I just ordered from the appetizers because it just seemed tastier. I ordered the Cholula Boneless Wings. They were pretty good. The flavor was cholula blended with butter. It was a star. The spicy chicken flour taquito thing they had, I don't know the name but was made with flour and looked more like an egg roll. It was flavorless. Im dipping salsa and cholula on it to get some sort of flavor. The other thing i couldn't figure out is that it's owned by station casinos, why is beer pricier in the restaurant when the bar next the it was cheaper. It made no sense and we would have to walk out to save a buck. Hopefully fix some things and revamp the menu. I don't know if i would go back unless I hear some positives. Till next time...Let's Eat!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican and decided to give this place a whirl. There was a wait for the restaurant, but tables at the bar, so we sat at the bar. Chips and salsa were brought immediately as well as our drink order. I thought none of the salsas were particularly hot (I love spicy) but had decent flavor. I had enchiladas and my hubby had the fajitas. Our meals were fine. There wasn't anything wrong with anything, just nothing memorable or special I guess. Our waiter Paul was excellent. He had all the tables in the bar full and running smoothly, he was quite impressive!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group on a Friday night before our dinner reservation- the bar is rimmed with cocktail tables for couples or those grabbing a light bite. We were provided complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, and drinks came out quickly.   Unfortunately, our server was a total Debbie Downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn't intend to order a full meal. Our waters stayed empty, a bill was slapped on our table, and she repeatedly walked by and said \"thanks for coming\" as if to shoo us out early.   Considering we each bought $10+ margaritas (the mango-jalapeno is tasty!) and tipped well, her attitude was totally unwarranted."}
{"text":"We came to Aliante casino to enjoy their new restaurant Cabo. I received a email to come and try the $7.99 All U Can Eat Taco special that is available all-day. The wait time to be seated is about 20 min but that is expected because the restaurant is brand new to the Aliante community. Sitting at the bar is quicker and the bartender is pretty cool.   But this entire experience turned into something very horrible. Once we were seated and placed our order for two tacos each, it took Cabo exactly one hour to bring the first order of tacos out to us. Prior to receiving our food, we had to complain to the manager that its taking forever and he advised us that our food is now ready to be delivered to our table. Moments later one of our many waitress' advised us that our order has been lost and they have to start over on making our food. This really had me beyond upset. Once again we complained to the manager and he offered to comp our drinks from the bar and food.  Now, once our food finally came out after many complaints and waitinf for 60 minutes to get it and eating through two baskets of chips, we all thought everything was going to be smooth sailing from there until the one person in my party, who's allergic to tomatoes and onions, began to feel really really sick while eating. She distinctly told the manager and a waiter and waitress that she's allergic to those ingredients three times before ordering. They didn't put the ingredients on her tacos but failed to tell her that they marinated their meats in a tomatoe and onion sauce.  After she ran out the restaurant to puke all of her food up the manager kept asking me if I would like another drink and I'm like \"No! You jerk! You guys just poisoned my friend!\". Cabo eventually called security who then called the EMT's who had to treat her. It was so embarrassing. After being treated and filing an incident report with Aliante Casino's Risk Management department we went back to Cabo to get a business card and info of the manager. His name was Joe, he refused to give us his last name, and gave us a business card of Cabo's food and beverage director who's not even located in Las Vegas. How unprofessional is that?!  On the other hand, Pricing on food ranges from $4-$18 depending on what you order. They also have a 3p-6:30p on Fridays and that includes $4-$6 and a drink special that include beverages from $4-$6.  Overall, the new addition to Aliante casino is horrid! I will never again in my life order food or even a glass of water from this horrible restaurant. We even told the manager that we're affiliates of Yelp.com and he gave us a serious blank stare and asked \"What is Yelp?\". Really sir?! Smh at this unorganized establishment and its rude staff. The only reason I give this restaurant one Yelp Star rating is because its not available to give them a negative five Yelp Star."}
{"text":"CW Margarita was a good choice. It was national nacho day so I gave in and was not disappointed.  Sat out on the porch and a the view was awesome."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my family and we got seated right away. The server was very nice and checked on us a lot. The salsa bar was amazing, the salsa range from mild to super spicy. There was also a nice bean dip.   We had to cadillac margarita and a mojito. The margarita came with a shaker that you could take home. The entries were delicious."}
{"text":"I stood for a long time waiting to be noticed just so I could get seated. They seemed very short staffed and the hostess was running around tending to tables and didn't notice the people waiting. Our server was great. Poor dude was running around trying to keep up with all the tables but with them all full and barely any help it was hard. I had a hard time getting something to even drink when I was first seated and getting a refill was even harder.   The complimentary chips and bean dip are great however the salsas are nasty. My wife and I shared some con queso dip and that was the best part of the meal. Very cheesy and lots of flavor. I had fajitas and they were not cooked how i asked. Some of the meat was still raw and the rest was tough. Only getting 3 tortillas my whole meal was complete crap too. I couldn't even catch my server to ask that the fajitas be remade because he was out of sight or rushing food to a different table. The beans that came with my meal were also hard. Cabo needs to get more employees on hand so things can run more smoothly."}
{"text":"Service good. Thanks Justin. Bartender is lazy. I have your wine but not a full glass so none for you. Had to settle for a Tecate didn't even come with lime. LAZY"}
{"text":"Horrible service from Rebecca from the moment we sat down.  She did show up quick only to tell us that you have to have a hostess seat you, the hostess told us to sit down and she would be bringing the menus.  Rebecca replies oh ok then disappears.  We get served chips and the dips in a timely manner then after 15 minutes shows up to take our drink order.  Drinks came out 15 minutes after that.  After sitting for 30 minutes without a drink and having chips in front of us we were parched to say the least.  We had decided on our order but she never came back to take it by the time she did we just asked for the check.  On a positive note Isadore was fabulous in refilling our chips and refilling our waters. Maybe Isadore should be promoted to being a server and Rebecca should demoted to the sever assistant job. Rebecca even asked us to look behind her at the table that just sat down and wanted to know if they had menus.  We said yes they do they must have been sat by the hostess Rebecca says ok if they didn't have menus I would just ignore them.  Good customer service Rebecca way to take pride in your job."}
{"text":"The large margarita was HUGE!  It was the best mango margarita I've ever had.  The food was great, but they were a little skimpy of the chicken in the fajitas.  I'm not a huge fan of the salsa.  It was either too hot or not spice.  Overall it was an enjoyable place to go.  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Quite frankly...the Alliante Station might be the worst hotel in Las Vegas when it comes to finding a decent meal.  With the exception of MRKT, the other outlets have no concept of fresh well prepared food.  Tonite I tried Cabo...Del Taco has a better chance of getting me back...cheap ingredients prepared poorly with no attention to detail is not a combination for success."}
{"text":"This is a  pretty standard Mexican food with pretty standard service. It is located inside of Sunset Station in Henderson. They have an outside and inside bar attached to the restaurant. We dined here on Cinco de Mayo and it was one of the few spots that was not packed. The food was marginal and something you'd be able to find at any Mexican restaurant in town. My carne asada platter was lacking flavor coupled with chewy, low grade quality meat. I was only able to finish a small portion of my meal. We had their cornoitas which were margaritas with a mini bottle of corona draining into it. The margarita mix was sweet and the drink as a whole a complete bust. The prices are in the $15-20 pp range and most definitely not worth it. I don't think anything can compel me to come back.    It is a shame that proprietors of Mexican restaurants appear to think that their clientele are either stupid or lazy enough to accept substandard food.  I get that there is not much more upward mobility or fine Mexican dining out there, but the restaurant community can do way better."}
{"text":"Service OK.  Chip and salsa, good.  Food, small portion and not very good.  Price, $25 for two people for two entrees and two iced tea."}
{"text":"I've since been back to Cabo and noticed a new crew of management.  They seemed really attentive and were on the floor the entire time helping the staff.  Service seems faster and with a much happier attitude.  Very pleasantly surprised by the changes.  Good job Cabo!  We will be back after having such a pleasant visit!"}
{"text":"If we're in the mood for Mexican food, Cabo is a great place!  Located in Sunset Station Casino, they are only open for dinner.  I still wish they would open earlier for lunches so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Included with every meal is the complimentary salsa bar.  There are about 12 different choices of salsa.  There is a good variety of milds, mediums and hot salsas.  On the salsa bar is also bean dip which I always enjoy too much of before my meal.    The entrees are good and always filling.  We've tried the fajitas, enchiladas, salads and chimichangas.  All have been throughly enjoyable and tasty! Like every Mexican restaurant, they are accompanied by rice and beans.    Service here has been good.  Waiters have remembered us even if it's been a while since our last visit.  Our drinks stay filled while being treated with polite and personable service.  Since our first visit, we've been back many times to enjoy their great food.  Olé!"}
{"text":"What a delightful meal! Cabo is nestled into a quiet corner of Sunset Station Casino, and is furnished with beautiful and rustic Mexican decor. The menu has enough to satisfy any palate searching for a good Mexican dinner, but not so much as to overwhelm you.   Our server was Daniel, and he was delightful. He was attentive, funny, knowledgable, and helpful. Truthfully, he is the main component of what made our dining experience so memorable.  I couldn't decide between the chicken tamales and the chicken enchilada, so Daniel suggested I get the combo platter as to enjoy both! I did prefer the enchilada to the tamale, but both were great, filled with shredded chicken and topped with a mild green sauce.   The manager, Mike, even stopped by our table to insure we were having a good dining experience. I was so very impressed with service.   I would definitely suggest Cabo. Go in and ask to be seated with Daniel!"}
{"text":"Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!"}
{"text":"After designating this as the \"go to\" restaurant for our birthdays, sadly our birthday girl didn't get the expected fanfare. Waiter, Ben said all three sombreros went missing 4 months ago and staff discontinued the traditional festivities. I wont be opting to celebrate my next birthday here."}
{"text":"The food was awful, rice had been setting there hard And dry for who knows how many hours.  The tortilla chips were old and had no flavor.  Margarita was really sweet and didnt not taste at all like it had any kind of tequila.  I def would not recommend it if you are looking for good mexican food."}
{"text":"I went there with my sister and cousins this summer. We were staying at Sunset Station for a golf tournament. From what I remember, the food was excellent. The Margarita (served in souvenir glass) was awesome. Servers were courteous and professional. We will go there again if we stay in Sunset Station Casino."}
{"text":"Popped in here with a girlfriend before the Pat Green concert last Saturday. I almost felt obligated to have some Mexican food before such a concert, although I knew nothing in this city could compare to food in Texas. Still, we went in.  I knew we were good to go the moment that chips and four types of dip were delivered to our table. Two types of salsa, beans and guacamole. Heavenly! The peppery salsa is to die for. The margaritas are good, too, of course.  The entree was, apparently, not up to Austin standards, but I liked it nonetheless. The Spanish rice had a good consistency (some places make it too dry) and the cheese enchiladas weren't anything to write home about, but they hit the spot.  The only downside is that the place doesn't open until four, which was pretty upsetting to find out when I tried to take another friend there later. Still, it's a good dinner spot, and Red Rock is a lovely resort."}
{"text":"Not good! The beans were so hot they burned my mouth, but the burrito was lukewarm at best, not even enough to melt the cheese! They brag on the salsa bar, but I wasn't impressed. I'm giving two stars because the margarita was decent."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to eat here after watching a movie due to it's decent prices and convenience of already being at the Red Rock. Also because we've all mutually agree that military messing facilities and a good 80% of airline food we've eaten is better then anything the \"Feast\" Buffet can offer.  Going here was like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan. Cabo met all our demands for a place to eat that offered variety and good food to cost ratio, similar to how  Omaha beach was chosen for the invasion of Normandy.   After we ordered everything looked alright as we departed from our transports out on the sea of waiting for food to come. When it food came it was chaos.  Disappointment ripped through me like a German Machine gun net hacking apart sea sick soldiers trying to land. The pictures on the menu looked nothing NOTHING like the hell that looked back at me on the plate.  The beef was overcooked and had parts of dark dry red areas suggesting it's been cooked earlier, thrown to the side, then heated up again. The pork was whole instead of shredded from the picture. The chicken...oh god the chicken...so many hormones and antibiotics used in our live stock yet the most pathetically small chicken breast i have ever saw and it looked like half of it was blown away by German motar fire.   During the entire meal i felt like the medic struggling to maintain myself and stop of bleeding of this poor wrenched soul of a meal. One bite of a piece of shrimp, SUCCESS!! the bleeding stopped!! there's something to look forward to!! another chew and a stray bullet penetrated that poor soul's helmet sending him to his preferred afterlife....all that effort...for nothing.   As we walked away from the meal i told myself...'never again...never again'  (Note - There are many ways i could have written this review. I choose to do it this way for it's the most entertaining for me and for readers)"}
{"text":"I've always gotten good food except once, new cook maybe? but usually the food is amazing and hearty to the point where my husband and I can actually share a meal. I like to go when it's not busy as the seating can feel a little squished and not very intimate."}
{"text":"This is going to be the first of many reviews because they have helped me so much I've decided to start writing. This one is short. The shrimp cocktail wasn't great but the tacos were good. Even though they were small, they only cost one dollar a piece during happy hour. The customer service on a scale of 1-10 was about a 7. I would go there again but it wouldn't be and wont be my first choice next time. I had a decent lunch for under ten dollars, including my bud ;). On a good note - the dollar i got back for change won me 58 on the star wars slot machine right after lol."}
{"text":"We came for dinner, we happened to be staying in the Casino fort the night. Food and service were really good.  The salsa was great!"}
{"text":"My constant readers know that I am about as fair as possible when writing reviews, always looking to find something to recommend, but I am afraid the only thing in this particular Cabo was the Bean Dip and I am sure that was out of a can as the tortilla chips were out of a can.  My urgent warning is STAY AWAY FROM HERE. Here is why:  After taking a bite of my entree there was a high acid, high metalic, high \"Smoke\" taste that was quite simply hazardous. If this was just in the rice I could live with it, but it was intensely pervasive in the Fajita Burrito as well. After literally two bit I stop and even after being offered a new entree I refused for fear of truly being poisoned. I do not know what the exact contaminant was but since it was in the rice and burrito it was a systemic issue and that tells me no matter what the entree there was a problem.  My wife's plate had the same problem but after a couple of bites she had to find a restroom before making a public scene and having the food returned in the \"Roman\" manner.  I have eaten in some of the best Mexican Style eateries in the world, lord knows L.A. has a ton of them. But when the manager insists the food is fine (without tasting it) I must be mistaken. I had sent the food back after two bites so it is not likely my germs were on that plate, there were more germs from the cook and server on it than me and still she wouldn't touch it (or maybe she knew there was a problem). After that the excuse was that it couldn't have a problem because the Health Department gave them an \"A\" rating which of course means absolutely nothing today when the inspection was whenever in the past.  Fortunately I was not expected to pay for those entrees, but a tab did come along for the Iced Teas we drank. I pointed out that my wife was no longer enjoying that Iced Tea and only then were we free to leave, hungry but without an appetite.  So, why am I so upset? It's not like this is the first time I have eaten food from a questionable kitchen, but it is the first time no-one seemed to care about it. Here was a restaurant full of people who were possibly exposed to something very bad and they were still sending out plates. INEXCUSABLE.  Will this kitchen get better? Most likely but the same team will still be there and I know I will NEVER be back because the place is more interested in serving bad food (in more then one sense) than being safe.  The Health Department should be informed.  ---  As an aside I asked myself why people were not running out of the place when I realized it is quite possible people didn't realize something was wrong and opposed to making a scene and returning the food ate it thinking \"Maybe this is how it's supposed to taste.\" If you think that absurd realize most people will keep drinking that bottle of rare vintage wine even if it turned to vinegar years ago because it is a \"rare vintage\" and are told it is good. This happens a lot."}
{"text":"Just say NO to Cabo.   This restaurant is only open for dinner. My boyfriends grandma turned the big 9-0 and this is where she wanted to eat. I'd like to think she chose this place because she has little to no taste buds left, and she can't tell how crappy it really is. I really can't fathom why anyone would wanna eat here.   Service- They quickly put together our table of 10 a few minutes after they opened. Our server was nice but wasn't around as often as we needed him to be. I did like that they sang happy birthday to his grandma (@ our request) and brought her a churro with whipped cream as a birthday treat. That was a nice gesture for sure.   Salsa bar- Probably the only saving grace this place has is the salsa bar. It's located in the front and has about 10 different salsas as well as chips. You can help yourself to as much or as little as you like. I liked the avocado salsa, the pineapple salsa and the bean dip. The bean dip is little spicy, but it's not bad.  After we browsed the menu a bit, we all ordered and our food came out in record time, like within 15 minutes. There were 10 of us and it was super quick. This leads me to believe most of the stuff is already pre-cooked. I wasn't expecting anything more, just an observation.   Food- Most of the stuff I am sure is microwaved. The tacos were soggy and the enchiladas were definitely a day old. The portions are really skimpy here too, especially for the price. My boyfriend and his mother ordered the fajitas, chicken for him and shrimp for her. I counted 6 pieces of chicken on his plate, and about the same amount of shrimp on hers. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, and it came with 4 pieces. This is meant to be ordered as an appetizer, but I chose this because I just wasn't that hungry. The shrimp were a decent size and the bacon was crisp. Inside the shrimp was a miniscule piece of white cheddar cheese and I couldn't even taste it. The shrimp come with a honey mustard sauce that is smeared on the plate, and crispy onion strings. Like the kind you find on burgers. It is a really weird garnish for this plate. I found the honey mustard extremely off putting and not complementary to the shrimp. And the onion strings? So weird. Granted the food wasn't horrible and our bellies were full when we left, but I just don't think this place is worth returning. For everything it was around $160, gratituity already included.   Overall- Overpriced food and mediocre service, bye Felicia."}
{"text":"My first visit to Cabo was this afternoon and I must say my visit was nothing less than spectacular. Their happy hour rivaled any local bar in town, $2 cazadores shots.. There must be a mistake. The food was amazing.. I enjoyed a 2 item combination that included the steak taco al carbon and chile relleno. The tacos were border line best I've ever had. And I'm not joking. The chile relleno was amazing as well. And I can't leave out Jenni the server, running around helping every single customer like it was her own. Our meal was by far the best we have had in town."}
{"text":"Nothing better than free (comp) food.  The prices are reasonable overall and have had some great meals here.  Chips and salsas are good and everything from the bar has been tasty as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After a visit to Cabo at Sunset Station, I was completely disappointed. Their website stated that their Happy Hour was from 5-6:00 PM for Sunday. Went there and asked for 2 Margaritas for the Happy Hour and was told that we are not doing Happy Hour this Month..... Really? So after a manager came over she said there was a change but was not posted on their website, ok?  So we ordered 2 regular margaritas and there was approximately 1/2 oz of tequila.  What a disappointment : (( Still paid the 7.00 each for two margaritas. Their menu is always the same, they never seem to change it up. I feel their prices are extremely high for the quality of their food. Actually the last two times we have eaten there, I thought I would give them one more chance. Well, last night was their last chance, I will never go there again. As the BIG man/woman who sits in his/her palace and continues to rake in the cash for their horrible establishment, well I will no longer go there or to any of their establishments throughout the casinos........ When speaking to the manager, I had asked her to kindly contact the King/Queen of Cabos and update their website, as usual she said there was nothing she could do...... You go girl because I will tell 30 of my closest friends about your horrible service and they will tell 30 of their friends as well...... So in closing I suggest you review establishment and read all comments about everything.    If I could give you a third chance, I would. not.... Not sure if Cabo ever reads their reviews or not but I hope you see this review......"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were Guests of the Hotel. We wanted to a Bar to watch the Warriors game at and walked pass Cabo. It wasn't busy so, we decided to try the place out.  We SPECIFICALLY ordered Coronaritas. The Waitress then drops off MARGARITAS. I politely informed her WE ORDERED CORONARITAS and she RUDELY / SARCASTICALLY replied, \"No, you ordered Margaritas. We ran out of the mni Corona bottles\". First off, WE KNOW what we ordered, so for her to reply back with that rude remark had us both unhappy. She kept trying to ask if we wanted something else, we kept saying \"No, nevermind\", and she just kept insisting as if anything after her 1st remark would make up for it.  THEN, our food comes out. Disgusting. We didn't finish any of it.  THEN, I couldn't even her attention for the Check as we were waiting 15-30 minutes for service, so I had enough and requested for a Manager.   As soon as the Manager walks over, the Waitress decides to come to us and ask if we wanted our Check.   Fortunately, the Manager took care of us, but we will NEVER go to this Restaurant EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome but they changed it into a bar.   We enjoyed our food and it was as great as I remember   However the ambiance sucks.  Since we are not drinkers the two barmaids (the only staff) could care less whether they serve us. A great place gone down the toilet."}
{"text":"1. I sat down in a table alone. 2. I ordered a Coronita. 3. A guy brought me some chips and salsa. 4. I asked my server if the salsa bar is free. 5. She said it is. 5. While I was drinking my Coronita and eating chips, 3 servers came by to ask me if I want to order something to eat. 6. I told them that I am good with some chips and salsa. 7. When I asked for the bill, I was charged for $3.99 for chips and salsa. 8. When I asked my server why I was charged $3.99, she told me I am being charged because I did not order an entree. 9. I asked if I can order an entree now instead of paying $3.99 for some effn chips and salsa. 10. She said the kitchen is closed. 11. She also said that the chef \"just\" told her that customers that do not order food are being charged for some chips and salsa. 12. She said she was \"sorry\" and she did not even bother to ask her manager for any solution. ***I do not care if you charge $3.99 for some chips and salsa for god's sake but YOU BROUGHT THE EFFN CHIPS AND SALSA (I DID NOT ASK FOR IT) PLUS I WAS NOT TOLD THAT I WAS GOING TO GET CHARGED IF I DO NOT ORDER ANY ENTREE. THANKS FOR NOT TELLING, WRONGFULLY CHARGING AND BRINGING SOME CHIPS AND SALSA THAT I DID NOT ORDER. NOW TAKE MY $3.99 AND GTFO."}
{"text":"Cabo at Red Rock was a fave for awhile, before I really migrated beyond \"a solid cheese enchilada\" in my expectations for Mexican food. (I still love a good cheese enchilada, but these days when I dine out I usually want more invention that something I could make at home.) I always did like their bean dip, though. Cabo at Palace was about the same.  We decided to try Cabo at Aliante before the (breathtaking, amazing) Lindsey Buckingham show there last month. The bar of expectations was lowered back to \"comfort food\" levels, and we looked forward to some good chips and bean dip and some decent food, if not very fancy or creative.  Alas, the star is for the friendly staff... and that's about it.  To give the experience anything above a single star would require wearing margarita goggles, and we were only drinking soda. (At least whenever we could. Refills were slow. Overall service was even slower.)  The bean dip wasn't as good as we remembered, but perhaps our tastes had changed. It wasn't bad, though, and we ate it all as we waited... and waited... (I seem to recall other Cabos offering us refills of chips and salsa. As ours eventually disappeared, we sat with empty bowls in front of us.)  Mind you, the chips were kind of hard-tasting and rough, so maybe they did us a favour. I can only blame hunger for the reason we kept eating them.  The queso dip we ordered as a starter was fine for a few bites, when hot and fresh, but soon we realized that it didn't have any taste. \"It just tastes like... glue? yellow glue?\" None of the advertised onions, chiles, or tomatoes seemed to be there other than a token two red chile slices as garnish.  We watched a server make the \"tableside guacamole\" for the people to the right of us. We'd seen this done expertly at other Cabos. Here it was just a woman grunting to herself, turned slightly away from the table as she dumped the ingredients together and mashed them with a fork until they were barely mixed.   On our other side, someone got the well-advertised taco special. You know how when you order tacos in a place where Mexican food is pretty unknown, and you get some vivid yellow corn shells with vivid green iceberg lettuce and dumpy brown meat, and what looks like a stream of ketchup across the top? (I hope you don't.) We took one look at the man's plate and both turned to each other. \"I'm glad we didn't order that!\"  Oh, cocky us.  My husband had ordered nachos and I'd ordered the cheese enchiladas. His nachos looked like someone had thrown the ingredients on a plate and not bothered to mix them up. One side had almost all the cheese, another almost all the beans, and so on. And the taste... bleh. \"The sauce tastes like Pace. It tastes worse than the table salsa!\"  I ate half of my cheese enchiladas, but it was just too bland, like someone had rolled cheese in a tortilla, melted it in the microwave, then poured jar sauce over it and set it in the oven for a few minutes.  After a few bites, Mike gave up. My peaceful husband would normally have just written this off, not wanting to deal with potential drama, but the longer he stared at the nachos, the more disgusted he was with them. When our waitress came by to ask how things were, he explained why he wasn't happy and asked that she show the chef so the chef could see there was a problem. He didn't ask for the nachos to be taken off the bill, but the waitress suggested it, and when she asked for authorization, it was approved.   Like I said, nice people. A bit overwhelmed with a busy Friday night crowd, I guess, as we ended up with only enough time before the show to hit the restroom, which we both very much needed to do. I'm just saying.  Next time Lindsey Buckingham comes to Aliante, we'll just concentrate on a gourmet treat for our ears and eyes, and we'll skip the sub-mediocre offerings for the mouth."}
{"text":"Although the food was decent, our waiter was terrible. We are seated for a few moments before the waiter approaches to take our drink order. He returns with place settings. Few minutes later comes with our drinks and says the chips are on their way. Must have been coming right from the border because we waited about 10 minutes before we were delivered what was the bottom of the barrel crumbs. I ordered the enchilada and chimi taquito combo both with chicken, with rice and refried beans and my friend ordered the chimi taquito and mini burrito, both with chicken, with black beans and rice. The meal was pretty good, not the best I've had in town, but ok. However our waiter disappeared. We had to ask the busser Cody for a refill on our Pepsi!! He was the best part of our experience!!! When our waiter finally showed up he stood about 4 feet away from us like we were contagious! Well perhaps maybe he was afraid to catch a personality!!!! I am sure I will eat here again but hope next time the service is better!  Oh and if you are wondering, they were not busy. It was about 9:30 in the evening and hardly anyone there. The previous time we were there all the tables were filled and our server that time was on too of it!!  They should make Cody a server. He was hustling out there!!!"}
{"text":"CABO is a fantastic restaurant that employs amazing people who do their job well and create awesome food and dining experience. I have shown my friends and family multiple times and plan on enjoying often."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for...  FRIED ICE CREAM!   Oh yes, if you want a huge fried ice cream thats big enough for 3 people [Or 1 if your a piggy like me] come here.   The food is delicious, the prices are very reasonable for it being a casino.   They also have unlimited enchiladas for 8.99. Woohoo. Time to get my enchilada on! The 1st plate comes with rice and beans. The 2nd and from on is just enchiladas, but you can pick between 3 different kinds. My favorite were the green chicken ones. Mmmm. SO FRIGGIN GOOD.  The waitress was just fab! She explained all the different alcoholic drinks. We wanted a couple to kick us in the ass. Especially since it was my best friends 21st birthday. Extra tip for her for the extra help.  Was very busy, thats a great sign. Wasn't just the usual crowd. There were families, older people and young. So nice to see a variety of people so late at night [10pm].  Overall, im coming here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"OMG, go eat somewhere else. Please listen to my post! This is not my first time here, my husband loves the fajitas. I won a $20 food credit for my excellent football picks for week 7, so I thought I would take my husband to Cabo. However, this visit on Halloween 10-31-16 was the worst ever. Server was friendly, but rushed. I understand. However, when the chips and salsa came, they were literally STALE. We couldn't get a busser to bring us a new batch. They must have been PRE PURCHASED and not made fresh. Somebody forgot to zip lock that bad. They were literally hard to chew. Strike 2: My little taquito that came with my 2 item combo, a taco Al Carbon, no sour cream or guacamole. My steak taco was so DRY I almost chocked on a piece. And last but lease, Jose a possible sous chef or ?? was arguing with another cook on the line / pass in Spanish. I was floored, they were so LOUD. The nice blonde manager had to come over and tell them to quiet down. I felt like it was a Spanish version of HELL'S KITCHEN. When you have an open kitchen available to the diners, you need a little class and couth for public sake. Don't think I'll be using my next $10/off coupon. I will eat a Chinese Chicken salad at the little café in the back."}
{"text":"I am quite surprised at the current ratings of this restaurant! (1.5 stars), I guess mainly because the lack of reviews. I actually have been really wanting to try this restaurant since I live close by Santa Fe Station and see the specials for this restaurant all the time. And since Stations Casinos is so kind as to offer dining credits to us all the time, it was time for some Mexican food!  Well, this is your average chain restaurant. The food was very average. The items we had were not AMAZING and were not horrible either. I have posted pictures of the food we did order.  I would actually rate this place 3.5 stars. The bonus for the chips and dip you get when you first get seated. The chips were warm and they offer 4 different dips! (3 levels of spicy, and a bean dip.) I loved it all! I guess almost filled up on that alone, but I wanted real food.  Me and the bf ordered the Cabo Party Platter $11.99 (appetizer) to share and the Combo #6 ($12.99) to share. The appetizer was pretty good. But not great. More than half the plate (quite a good sized order) was of nachos which were not that great, but the dip that came with us (an orangey colored creamy dip) was awesome for everything on the platter. The quesadillas were ... bland. But the other items on the platter were good.  And Combo #6. Slightly disappointing. The Chili Relleno was just bad. Pretty tasteless. The Chicken Tamale was also disappointing. Barely had any filling. But the beef taco was yummy!  I think we filled up too much on chips and saved no room for dessert. Bummer. I wanted to try the deep fried ice cream. Oh well.  Service was not too bad. We got seated right away and got the chips and dip right away and she actually explained each dip. But we were so into the menu and chips we didn't realize nobody came to take our drink orders. Until about 10 minutes later. But then they took our food orders right after. And it was less than 15 minutes and we got our food. The server came back to check on us a couple times. All was well. The booths and tables were clean. I do agree about the uniforms, they suck.  Overall, average. But kudos for the chips and dip :)"}
{"text":"Cabo pretty much meets your expectations. Chain Mexican food that was affordable and good. Great salsas and refried beans when you sit down. The service was probably the best we received while visiting the Palace Station."}
{"text":"HORRIBLLE MANAGEMENT asked to merge tables for group of 14. Manager did NOT have the curtsey to explain there was not enough space although there was only one other group of 15 in room, busser informed me. There was enough space to rearrange numerous empty tables many times, by the manager disturbing our  split group. Sunday evening at 7:45 the place was very slow, service was slow and food at best average. AVOID THIS PLACE WITH LARGE GROUP BECAUSE OF INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT AND SLOW SERVICE."}
{"text":"So Mexican food is pretty basic. However the music was so loud it was difficult to maintain a private comversation. I figure if I want people to listen in I will sit with them. Chicken salad was ok, the guac had half an avacdo in it. Keep your expectstions low. Overall nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying, this is no tex mex cantina, nor a hole in the wall eatery.  But its pretty darn good for a station casino, I wish they had better happy hours that extended to the table, but hey, I'll take what I can get!    My husband and I had a blast drinking one too many pina coladas and our sever was great too. The chips, salsa and bean dip where fantastic, and kept on coming!   The sopapias where okay, glad I didn't pay for them, thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've found in this town so far. Great chips and salsa bar. Bean dip was good. Had the appetizer sampler. Everything was good. Just wish it was open for lunch."}
{"text":"Got here at 7, finally got sat at 730..that was with reservations. Food gets served at 830. Food was warm but not hot as it should be. I ordered a burrito and it was smothered with sour cream. Waitress was nice but super slow.   Don't waste your money or time. Your not missing anything amazing here."}
{"text":"I took my folks here last weekend for dinner on a Saturday night.  They were busy but didn't seem to be at full capacity.  The service we received was absolutely awful, and it really disappointed me.  They seemed to be out of glasses, so we were served two of the four waters we requested in plastic cups.  Drinks took forever.  Everything took forever.  The food, which is usually good, was cold.  Rather than arriving sizzling, my fajitas arrived dead and cold.  If any of the management reads this, I assure you this is a fair review.  Terrible service  and cold food.    I will not be returning until you shape up."}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour specials. Cabo serves up a great happy hour menu from 4-6 pm seven days a week. My favorite item is the 12oz bud draft for 99 cents. They have bud light, lime or wheat as well. I prefer a craft beer most of the time but for the price, it's a good deal and I like beer, period. They have a pretty extensive hh menu, most of which I haven't tried. The shrimp cocktail is decent and has been voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" in recent years. That doesn't hold much water for me personally, but to each her own. They offer ceviche, cheese quesadilla, beef taco, bean tostada and an 8oz mojito all for 99 cents. They have about six items for $2.99 and $3.99 too. I can't vouch for any of these offerings as I usually drink the bud and then order off the regular menu.  The last two times I've been here, Dena has served me. She is great at her job! Always friendly and quick with a smile. We can be pretty demanding at times and Dena takes it all in stride. She takes notes, which I dig because I almost never order a meal straight from the menu. I usually add or subtract items and I always want something on the side. The food usually comes out to my specifications and when it doesn't, she is quick to please and remedy the situation.   I don't recommend driving across town to frequent this location but if you find yourself in the vicinity it's a pretty good stop. Standard \"Vegas Mexican\" food and rock bottom happy hour prices. Ya dig?"}
{"text":"Guacamole tableside ... perfect!  Salsa bar ... loved the habenero salsa (if you like it hot, try it)!!  Had a drink and a couple appetizers (the quesadillas were great).  Will be back to try more items.  Pleasantly surprised by the good service, decent ambiance, good prices and great food ... and as you know, good mexican food in Vegas is hard to come by."}
{"text":"went again last night!!!! DEEELISH!!! Had the we luv locals coupon for $60 worth of food for $30 HOW does one beat that!!! we had 4 margartias , tableside guac,bacon wrapped shrimp (bf had these and said they were VERY VERY good!) grilled fish tacos and he had 3 combo platter...total $44 !!! woohoo!!! We could have just had 2 margarita and it would have been just about exactly $30 but why not go for the GOLD!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely fast service, nice services, great food. I don't understand why this place has under 4 stars because I've been here so many times and every time has been so good!"}
{"text":"awful!!!  this place is so bad it doesn't deserve 1 star.  taco bell is much better don't go"}
{"text":"I am pretty surpsied to say it has gone downhill.  I ate at the one at santa fe station for years and it was decent.  They cut their portions and changed the food and it isn't so good."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if it were an option. The service was horrible!! Food was horrible! Hire new employees as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Hannah & Natasha, the two 20-something bartenders, are incredible bartenders! They give great service and make everyone feel welcome. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went into this place on a weekday for lunch and had to wait 10 mins to be seated, although there was only 1 other couple in there, After we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for the server to get my drink order. Finally after i placed my order, it took 45 minutes for the food to come out, which was cold, when my boyfriend (who is mexican) told the waitress that the tacos were cold, she had the chef remake them. When they came back out they were still cold. She should have just left it at that, but she proceeded to tell him that that's how they were supposed to be served, lukewarm. I can tell you he was not happy. We had to leave because we were late for work at this time. Will never go back to this place, if i could give it less stars than 1, i would."}
{"text":"Great selection of Mexican dishes. They have a salsa bar where you can create your own salsa for the chips. The margaritas are tasty, but they fill the glasses up with so much ice, if you don't drink them fast they get watery. If you ask for less ice your drink is not full, lol. I had the cheese enchilada and shredded beef tacos. It was very tasty, but the tacos were so greasy you needed tons of extra napkins. All in all it's a good Mexican restaurant. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the crazy amount of ice in your margarita in addition to only being open for dinner, starting at 5pm! For those of us that might want an early afternoon meal, forget it!"}
{"text":"I've gone here 4 different times with family/friends that wanted to try this place. Each time I ate here, I absolutely hated it.  I tried to convince family/friends to go somewhere else, with no luck.  So, in hopes of a change of heart, I ordered different entrees each time & tried to keep an open mind. Everything I ordered was mediocre or tasteless.  The chicken wings are decent to my surprise. Pina Coladas taste like there is no alcohol and prices are high for the quality of food/service.   Service is the worst and extremely slow, even when it's not busy.  I almost always tip 20% when I dine out, but I find myself tipping 15%  or lower every time I dine here (and this is being nice/polite). The servers aren't too bright, seem like they don't like their job, and act unprofessional.  To confirm my rating,  I say/express absolutely nothing to the people I dine with. I ask them how they liked dinner AND... I always get \"it was ok\", \"probably won't come back\" and *drum roll please* \"IT WAS AWFUL\"."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I would never come here by choice. The pictures didn't look appealing and we could make better food at home. Our friend had their wedding rehearsal dinner here with a group of 30 people. And I must say the staff did an awesome job accommodating us.  Our waitress (forgot her name) was super patient and friendly with our large group. The bussers made sure our glasses were filled and plates were taken away accordingly. The manager came around a few times to make sure we were all happy. They were even nice enough to split up all of our checks. So the stars in this review go to them.   As for the food, it's a completely different story. The only thing I enjoyed was the chip and salsa bar. The chips were crispy and warm. I liked that there were different salsas so you could try them all. They were all fresh and plentiful. Our main dishes were forgettable. I ordered lettuce wrapped tacos. The lettuce was wilted and the meat was boring. My BF ordered the carne asada. That was also boring and forgettable.   Not my first choice for Mexican food and probably will never be back here again."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is actually inside the Red Rock casino. The menu has a lot of variety and there should be something for almost everyone.   There are a ton of TV's so you can catch the game while you are eating. Strangely enough, there was actually a wedding in the back of the restaurant while we were there. The guests kept passing through the main part of the place. Interesting.  While the service is very good some of the dishes were not well prepared. Most of the meats lacked a lot of flavor. It wasn't an awful experience but it could have been better to be sure."}
{"text":"This place was not even that busy. We sat there for 25 minutes and they couldn't even take our drink order. I tried to get a manager, and all I got was rude responses from the employees. If I remember correctly from previous visits, the food wasn't that good anyway. Adios Cabo! You and your lousy staff won't see anymore of my money."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Fantastic service! Everyone makes me feel like family. Each server has been kind, attentive, genuine to me. I come here for almost every date night."}
{"text":"This review is for the Mexican Restaurant.  It's pretty good.  The salsa bar is great.  Big portions.  I would give it 4 stars but the decor is old"}
{"text":"i had the chimi taquitos, it came with guacamole and sour creme and salsa and it was delicious, my friend tried carnitas special and i tried it also, it was delicious"}
{"text":"We've been here many times (that's y 4 stars) tonight 2 1/2 at best.    I went & grabbed a table while my husband ran to the restroom, seated immediately.   Before I could even sit, our waitress Rai was next to me asking for our drink order.  My husband walked in right as she brought the drinks ( literally 30 seconds later) \"do you know what you want, decided yet?\"   I said we need a few minutes he just got here.  Less than 2 minutes later, we were talking, she came back \"ready now?\" & then hopped in the conversation.  We ordered.  Food was out less than 5 minutes later.  This was the last we seen of Rai.  No, \"is everything ok? Need anything else?\"  We had to grad another waiter for drink   We were in & out of here in under 30 minutes.  We felt extremely rushed.  It wasn't crowded so no need to turn tables.  Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant but after today's experience,  we will never return.   The service was horrible but that was the least of the problems.  Ordered a seafood burrito.  The food came out very cool inside, well under safe cooking temperatures, with a hard tortilla as if it has been sitting for a while.  Informed our waiter after being ignored forever.  Finally took the food back to be remade. A couple minutes later, food was returned to the table, and waiter immediately rushed off.  The burrito was the same burrito and was microwaved and returned to the table instead of making a new burrito with a fresh tortilla and cooked to proper food temperature.     At this point, we had to wait forever again for somebody to come to our table as we were being completely ignored. When somebody finally came again, we asked for a manager.  There was no manager at the restaurant and they had to call one to come.  The manager finally showed up, understood the concern and had a new meal prepared.  Now almost 45 minutes had passed, just tying to get this resolved all the while my family ate their meals.   The manager did show concern and removed the meal from the bill however, they need to address the bigger problem with their waiters and their attention to their patrons.  The restaurant was not too busy but none of the waiters would take the time to stop when flagged.  Couldn't even get beverages or chips refilled.  Very poor service and the quality of all the meals was just not up to the quality we have been used to over the years."}
{"text":"Visited this place around 4th of July Weekend with a party of three.  Atmosphere: Ok, but pretty dark Arrived during the late afternoon, there was still sun out. Upon entering the restaurant, there were lights on from the colorful chandeliers, but it was still rather dark. Upon seating myself at the booth with my party, the seats were comfortable. However, the overall atmosphere did not necessarily peak my interest.  Service: Excellent! The servers were nice and we were seated quickly. Cabo was not crowded when we arrived.  Food: Tasty, but nothing extraordinary I ordered some tacos. They all came with the fixings separate. I enjoyed the tacos, but they were nothing that I have not tasted before. All great nonetheless. However, like many Mexican restaurants, the tacos were a bit pricey.  Summary: Not bad at all! The only complaint I have the lack of lighting and price of the food. Other than that, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"on our date night we figured last time we came to early so now its time for mexican! I had a diners coupon that was sent in the mail for 10$ off so it was really a no brainer :) i recalled they had an awesome salsa bar and i was right. I love sweet salsas and they had two to choose from a pineapple salsa and a mix of different fruits. but my fave was the avocado salsa and the regular chunky.   for my meal i opted for the appetizer beach platter. it had a lil of everything chicken wings with ranch, steak nachos, chicken taquitos, and a plain cheese quesadilla. oh yes i cant forget the awesome cup of queso they also give you!!!!  If you ask me the cheese quesadilla was a throw away nothing very special about it, it was bland except if you dip it in the queso. I would love to have had more chicken wings or taquitos.  my fiance was thinking cheese so he ordered the cheese enchiladas, he is a manly man and sorry to say this was a puny meal for him. i of course shared mine :) Last time we were at cabo he ordered the shrimp tacos which he loved and he actually talks about from time to time so im sure he will go back to that next time around.   our waitress was very pleasant and we will definatly be back for another trip to cabo."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here with my family and really enjoyed the experience.   The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great.  Also I was surprised that gratuity is included in your bill. I found it a little pretentious that they automatically assume they deserve a tip."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!! My favorite is the chicken lettuce wrap! Yum! They have a salsa bar with so many different types of salsa, mild to hot and bean dip & all the chips you can eat! Service is great & I really like the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome Tequila,and hey you might see Sammy perform live there, I got to..Woo hooo     Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great drinks. & GT the bartender was fantastic :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time at the Cabo Mexican Restaurant. Service was really great and the food was excellent.  The inside decoration was very welcoming, as was the staff.  There is a self-serve unlimited salsa bar which was really great. Lots of choices for different salsas and always fresh, warm chips. I ordered the typical chicken burrito which was wonderful.  I definitely recommend stopping into Cabo if you have the chance."}
{"text":"Probably the most under-rated Mexican restaurant in Vegas - at least for the sort of thing I want to eat.  Two people can easily dine for under $25 and the complimentary salsa bar is amazing.  I order a grilled chicken nachos which is ENORMOUS (I can barely finish 1/3 of it if I am lucky  - the rest comes home to be grazed upon for a day or two) for $6.99.  Pleasant Decor, tasty food, MASSIVE servings and rock bottom prices. I can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"This placed has reopened as The Salted Lime. Rating is for the new place.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-salted-lime-north-las-vegas#hrid:OZJEtNQ_J4lUkD8-589_fw"}
{"text":"It has been a few years since our family has been to Cabo, so when Mom suggested it we were all down. First, our server Javier was amazing. Our drinks were never empty and there was never a dirty dish left on our table. He was awesome and very attentive! We started with the table side guac. It was super fresh, but I should have let him put in some more jalapeño! I had the tacos al carbon with chicken. The flavor was awesome. I'm allergic to dairy, so it's always good to find a Mexican restaurant that doesn't drown their tacos in cheese and makes them the real way!  The hubs had a steak quesadilla, Mom and brother got enchiladas suizas, and my SIL got the lettuce wraps. There wasn't a spot of food left on any of their plates, so you know it was good! We were already part of the way through our meal when I checked in so I was surprised at the low rating. Give them a chance! We loved it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service ! As a matter of fact it looked like our server went out of their way to ignore us. When we finally did get some food it was only average. The only good thing is the Salsa Bar. However, the little containers are so small you can't dip your chips into them without breaking the chips. We'll never go back ! I'd rather eat at Taco Bell. The rest of our experience at Sunset Station was excellent. Just stay away from Guadalajara's."}
{"text":"We ordered the Cabo appetizer platter and taco salad. The food was very good and service was okay. The only issue I had was the wait to be seated. They had empty tables that were not open on a Friday night. They seemed to be shorthanded."}
{"text":"I have no idea why they call this Mexican food. I lived in San Diego for over 50 years and I know Mexican food. This was not! We first tried to get a drink at the outer tables at the restaurant but the bartender said that we need to order at the bar. When I tried to order at the bar, the bartender ignored me and just kept playing with himself. We were seated in the restaurant and gave out drink order to the server. At least 5 minutes went by before she returned to tell my wife that they didn't have the wine my wife had ordered. I guess the bartender was busy pleasuring himself to look at his bar stocking.  We ordered our dinners and after some time they arrived. I ordered carne asada and it was nothing more then a cut up round steak with some grill marks and no seasoning. The sauce had an unusual and not identifying taste. the others in my party had nothing good to say for their meals and left more then half for the wait staff to take away.  This was not Mexican food and I would not have fed it to Russians. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This is always the stand-by when my friend and I are broke and hungry.  It's right across the street from his apt. and he always has coupons from restaurant.com, so we can gorge down some food and pay close to nothing.    I'm not saying the food is bad, it's pretty good.  I like the shrimp and chicken fajitas, and I love the margaritas specials.  Cabo's o.k. for some cheap eats, but it's nothing to write about...oops I just did!"}
{"text":"Very decent food but badly understaffed.  All of the booze and food dishes tasted great but service was SLOW!!!  Table-side guacamole and fresh salsas were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Angry waitress, slow and non-stop bitching..  Not a real happy girl.  Staff appears to hate their jobs/life. Food ok, looking like a micro tip.  Waitress does not care or give a sh*t"}
{"text":"Wow. It's not the first time I eat here. But has been definitely the BEST.... Our server was Jeanette. She was awesome, and very knowledgeable of her menu. She also suggested raspberry margaritas for my husband and I and those were great too. The food was great, service and atmosphere were good too.  I really recommend her to be your server next time you visit Cabo. Thanks Jeanette for your service."}
{"text":"I like Cabo but since they aren't consistent between the Station Casinos they are hit and miss. They were not busy and service was good. The decor is different depending on the Cabo you are at and I did like the blue lights they have at this one.   Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to us. The chips and bean dip were decent but the salsa needs a lot of work. I always like to start with the \"Con Queso Dip\".  At this Cabo it is priced at $5.99 and was delicious. For my meal I ordered \"Cheese Enchiladas\" made with flour tortillas. I asked for very light sauce and when my meal was brought out the enchiladas were covered in sauce. I mentioned it to the server who said she told them to put very little. She then walked away and I figured I would see if I liked what was brought. Well, I didn't. The sauce tastes like it maybe comes from a can and is just nasty. The server must have seen I wasn't eating it I don't know but she brought me 2 more enchiladas with light sauce. I did appreciate the gesture. The food is just A-OK and nothing spectacular.  The rice is kinda dry. Hubby had \"Beef Fajitas\" and said they were good.   There is a happy hour if you sit in the bar. They have tv's. Currently they don't open until 4 pm daily. With your players card they sometimes have monthly meal promotions."}
{"text":"The food at Cabo is solid but nothing unique. It's the same type of menu items you can find at most Mexican restaurants these days. However, the execution of those items is pretty good. The steak in my chimichanga was tender and the flavor was great. The outside of the chimichanga was fried perfectly -- light and crispy -- and they didn't smother it in cheese. It had just the right amount on top. My wife's chicken tacos lacked flavor, but adding some of their salsa to it helped. And speaking of salsa, the chips and salsa they bring out are good, along with the guac and bean dip. The cheese quesadilla appetizer was big enough for 3 or 4 people and was also cooked perfectly. The service was great. Our waiter was always stopping by to check if we needed anything and to refill our drinks. It was a good experience all around."}
{"text":"After the last 2 visits, I feel differently about this Cabo location. Not all of the Cabo's are consistent and now this one isn't either. Major bummer! There was no line when hubby and I arrived, but we still stood there waiting for about 10 minutes before someone noticed us. I would have wondered if they were even open, but I called prior to see if they had a wait and any specials going and the girl who answered the phone said to come on down. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes to have chips, salsa, bean dip and drinks brought to out table. It would have been nice if we were acknowledged sooner.  We ordered \"Chili Con Queso\" priced at $5.99 to start. This is the one thing here that is still consistently good. It has a blend of cheeses with onions, tomatoes, serrano chilies and comes with tortilla chips. For the price it is a great deal and goes a long way. I had the AYCE \"Crispy Tacos\" for my meal priced at $8.99 that included beans and rice. The beans were cracked on top and hard. The rice was so dry and flavorless. My tacos (chicken and ground beef) had a terrible flavor and the bottoms of the taco shells were so greasy and soggy that when I picked up my first taco the bottom fell out. I would have asked for new tacos, but the place was packed and I only saw 2 servers and one person clearing tables, so flagging someone down wasn't easy. I had honesty gotten my fill with the chips, salsa, bean dip (it wasn't cracked and hard like the beans on my plate) and chili con queso anyway and didn't want to wait any longer than we had been waiting during our experience already.  Our server was nice (what I saw of him) and I could tell he was really trying, but with very little staff on hand he could only do so much. Maybe if they had the proper amount of help they could have put out better dishes like I have had in the past and service would have been more timely and just all around better."}
{"text":"I still have to give it 4 stars because the food really is tasty. (minus the salsa it isn't very good)  I however had a bad experience when eating here the last time that I feel you need to know about.  We ordered the special they had at the time where you get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99. When it came time to pay the check the server said she needed one of our Stations Reward Cards for the discounted price of $9.99 (without your card you don't get it at that price) and I happened to have mine handy so I gave it to her along with $45 to pay for the meal and asked for the change. I looked at my receipt when I got home and noticed she used my stations card to pay for the meal with point from my card and not the cash which leads me to believe she pocketed the cash. She did bring change back but said it was $7 and I had told her to keep that for her tip. I wish I would have payed attention to the receipt then and there but I just didn't and trusted her and what she said. I called the Reward Center and told them about hat happened and that I wanted the points put back on my card that this was absolutely unacceptable. She agreed and assured me someone from Food and Beverage would be contacting me. Well, after 3 phone calls and 2 e-mails I cannot get anybody to respond to this complaint. I even went in person to Cabo and they said that person was off and they would have them contact me. This is FRAUD. I will never ever go back to this location.  can't believe Stations which caters to mostly locals would allow something like this to happen?! I will always check my receipt at any Stations from now on and encourage you to pay attention as well. This is just so upsetting."}
{"text":"This is a great place . great food . hot chips. Beans . salsa mucho chido.. Que rico.margRitas numero uno"}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at the Red Rock -- it's on the casino level of the hotel. OK, so I'll say up front that I was already a little drunk when we got here... but it was still good.  The wait staff was attentive... perhaps a little too much. I felt a little rushed through my meal. I'm a slow eater, especially when it comes to fajitas and talking to my friends.  The sangria was good,  but not the best I've ever had.   But still, 4 stars for a solid plate of food and good drink."}
{"text":"Cabo Mexican Restaurant is another example of how Red Rock could do better.   Come on people, this is Mexican food. My Norweigan grandmother makes better Mexican food than this.  The special prices are reasonable and the food is edible, just not anything you'll write home about. I made the mistake of ordering a ribeye in Mexican restaurant once. Probably the worst cut of beef I have had outside of prison (jk), it was so tough and all sinew.  Still you have to applaud a $9 fajita or an AYCE tacos special.   Like I said, it is edible, just not memorable."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  My server's forgetfulness (took away menu after I told her I wasn't done looking at it and also gave me refried beans when I asked for black). The other server who was missing for 15 minutes (who was supposed to get chips and salsa to each table as they were sat). The chicken carbon taco. The seat cushion almost fell over when I sat on it (and I don't weigh very much).  LIKE  The cheerful hostess. My server's personality (very nurturing and was apologetic for the above). The many salsa dips the chips came with. The steak carbon taco.  LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"Not sure if others have mentioned but they have ALBONDIGAS soup!!!! (vegetable soup and meatballs with a mild spice kick to it) It was sooooo delicious!!! Yeah, I come to vegas and go for the albondigas soup, go figure.  I was impressed with their complimentary chips and salsa. Other mexican restaurants would only give you one kind of salsa, but here at Cabo, they gave us a mild salsa, hot salsa (my fav out of the three) and bean dip. I'm not a big fan of beans but this was really good.  Prices were alright. Typical. My albondigas soup was $5.99...and it was a pretty big bowl. I ordered a shimp tacos combination plate and it was $11.99 i think.  All in all, I wouldn't go outta my way for this."}
{"text":"Sat down here for lunch with my sister on a weekday. We sat in the outdoor area. Unfortunately the table we had was only half shaded (they have giant umbrellas everywhere for the tables). My sister sat under the sun and got a little flushed but it was lively and fun, not overwhelming. Our waitress was really sweet and attentive, and the food came out quickly. The portions are pretty generous! And really delicious. The drinks themselves are really fun and great too! I would definitely come again, maybe at night so I can see all the lights strung up around the umbrellas."}
{"text":"I guess that the Cabo Mexican Bar and Restaurants are a staple found in the Station Casinos around Las Vegas. I want to put in a good word for their bar at the Palace Station. They have an excellent happy hour. Oh yes .... the usual 4 -6 PM happy hour. But what sets them apart is the quality of the Margarita's you get for $4.00. They call them Perfecto Margarita's.... and that is just what  I found them to be. Beautiful glasses holding a generous amount of quality tequila. They prepared Blackberry for me and they were just supurb.  On another occasion, we went to the bar later in the evening (11ish or so) and we sat at the bar and while waiting for our drinks we played the video poker.  The drinks arrived and the bartender comped the drinks because we were playing the machines. A super nice touch ..... I can't speak for all the other Station Casino properties, but if they can match the quality of the Palace Station, then their bars are definitely worth your time. A totally enjoyable time .....    ( if their bars are not that good, then head over to the Palace Station - It is definitly worth your time )"}
{"text":"SALSA BAR. Seriously.  Smells like old cigs inside (since it's in a casino),  food is alright (plentiful and salty) margaritas are weak as hell, but !! The open salsa bar with 10 distinct flavors: very wonderful."}
{"text":"Don't order margaritas or marg pitchers. They are way overpriced & no alcohol! Food was just ok- nothing special At All!! Won't be back here.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Well this was my first time at Cabo. Like most restaurants serve breadsticks Cabo supplies you with tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip while you decide on your meal. For my appetizer, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. Like most places with this dish they put cheese in between the bacon and shrimp.  The presentation lost some points with me because some off the cheese was seeping out. But they served it with crispy fried onions and a tangy sauce, close to honey mustard but with a little kick.  For my main dish, I had the chicken fajitas. This dish came with grilled chicken and vegetables, flour tortillas, Spanish rice, bean dip, sour cream and guacamole. If you don't have an appetite when you come here, order this dish and share with someone else.  Lastly, for dessert I had the deep fried ice cream. Nothing really special about this dish.  It's one scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by crispy tortilla chips coated in sugar and cinnamon."}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were seated right away, but there was a bit of confusion about who would be serving us, so after a few minutes the manager came over to take our drink order, which was nice.  She said that they were making more chips and that someone would bring us a basket in a few minutes.  About 10 minutes later I just went up to the salsa bar and got a basket myself since they had a full container of chips.    A few minutes later the gentleman who turned out to be our server brought our drinks and took our food order.  We started with a pitcher of shaken Classic Cadillac Margaritas- Cazadores Reposado tequila, Grand Marnier, fresh lime & sour, and a splash of orange juice.  I was expecting it to be weak, but surprisingly, the margarita was made pretty strong and very delicious.  They said the pitcher yielded 4 glasses, but we actually got 6 full glasses.  Maybe they used to have larger glasses, haha.     I ordered the combination plate, Rice and Black Beans on the side- $11.99 with the Shredded Chicken Taco- crispy corn tortilla, lettuce, pico, oaxaca & Monterrey jack cheese and the Mini Shredded Beef Burrito- peppers, onions, tomatoes, guac & black beans.  The taco shell was extremely greasy and soft at the fold, so I just ate the contents with a fork.  The chicken was good.  The shredded beef burrito was a little dry, but not bad.  The best part was the cup of black beans.  They were surprisingly outstanding.    The BF ordered the Carne Asada Platter 16.99,  Char-grilled steak, roasted poblano chile and cotija cheese. The menu stated that it was served with a cheese enchilada, fresh veggies, and flour tortillas, but he did not get any of those.  The steak was also very well done instead of medium.  All in all, pretty much what you'd expect in Sunset Station.  Except for the margaritas, it was just meh."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and the salsa they brought to the table is fantastic and tastes like it's homemade. If it's not freshly made, it's one of the best canned/jarred salsas I've had here in Vegas. Also, the food came out very quickly.  The service was impeccable. Our server Dena was amazing; attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. When I go back I will request her. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times and my previous review reflected those visits, but we went on Monday night 7/19 and the first thing we noticed was that the music was really LOUD, so loud that we could barely hear each other when we tried to talk and found that the waitress was having the same problem. We ordered a Coconut Margarita, but got a regular one, I asked for shredded beef tacos and got ground beef. We also noticed that the bean dip was extremely bland and its always been very good and when I received my chile relleno, there was hardly any sauce on it. I had to ask the waitress to bring me a cup of it to put on top.   I hope that they were just having an off night, but it would help if they would turn down the music so you can talk to your friends and maybe the waitress will be able to hear you and get your order right!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place but had never tried it until now. I had a hankering for some Mexican food and a friend recommended this place, so I bit.  There was a 15 minute wait and I haven't an issue with that. It just means it's a popular spot and I'm in for some good Mexican food! We were sat and informed that there was a self service chips and salsa bar. I found this to be pretty awesome. You can grab your own chips and pick what types of salsa you want to try. This made me an instant fan. What didn't make me a fan was that there weren't any napkins at the station nor at our table. Not certain if they are aware of this, but chips and salsa can get a little messy.  I ordered a taco salad minus the meat due to being vegetarian. It actually wasn't that bad but I will admit that I've had better. Nothing really wowed me about it and nothing really said authentic Mexican food to me. I could have gotten a better taco salad at Roberto's or an equivelant at Qdoba.   Overall, the waitress was very friendly and always checked on us. And the hostess even hunted us down at the nearby bar when it was time for us to be seated, so kudos on the service. As far as the food is concerned? It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. Nothing really said come back for more."}
{"text":"Four of us went here for dinner tonight with a $25 restaurant.com certificate.  Two people had fajitas (one chicken, one beef), my wife had Pollo Ranchero, and I had steak Tacos al Carbon.  We also had an order of table side made guacamole.  Everything was very good and we all enjoyed our respective meals very much.  The guacamole was outstanding.  Service was very good.  The staff was quick to refill drinks, and we were quite pleased with our decision to eat here prior to seeing Louie Anderson in the Bonkerz Comedy Club."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but I never reviewed it before.  We went here tonight and had a great meal.  Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.  We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.  For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.  For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.  I have a snack for TV time tonight.  I can finish my chips and guacamole while watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."}
{"text":"First time here.  The salsa bar was great.  Huge variety of salsa.  Service was good little slow at times.   But we got what we ordered. I had the three combo.shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada and Chili relleno.  Taco was awesome but next time I will try the ground beef. The shredded was big chunks so it got messy.  The enchilada was excellent. The relleno was a bit too greasy for my taste.   All in all it was a great meal presentation was lacking but the door was good."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times in hopes that the food and service might get better. Well this last visit I had the mahi mahi which was actually good and I liked the veggies it came with. I don't like that they only have one salsa choice. The service is pretty ridiculous, since everytime we go we seem to be forgotten and ingnored. We waited 20 minutes before even putting our drink order in. Overall the food is just ok,nothing to brag about at all, and the service just sucks."}
{"text":"Cabo Mexican Restaurant is located inside the Red Rock Resort and Spa. Nice modern restaurant open to the casino.  We sat at the bar right before Happy Hour and ordered some appetizers.   Tacos were very tasty so was the salsa and chips, but the service?  OMG please 20 something girls behind the bar sadly lacked personality and service skills.    I gave it 4 stars because the food was really good, tacos, quesadillas, salsa's all very tasty and reasonably priced but the service is a one star."}
{"text":"Strawberry mojitos and taquitos were great!! Wings are gross, but who orders wings at a mexican place? Chips and dip are great :)"}
{"text":"Just small changes could make a BIG difference at this restaurant. First let me say the staff was very friendly and attentive. And I wish to thank them for their service on a busy night. Now if they would concentrate on these few things. 1) have a hotter salsa such as habanero, something with kick. 2) provide fresh jalapeños. I asked for fresh and what I got was canned! 3) flavor up the rice!  That's it! Do this and the stars may go up!"}
{"text":"Not my first time at Cabo Mexican Restaurant, but my first time at this one.  This Cabo is located inside Sante Fe Station Casino, where you will find mostly locals.  The great thing about any restaurant at the Sante Fe Station Casino, there's almost no wait to be seated.  Yes, our locals at casinos located off the strip aren't here to eat.  Most are here to gamble.  We arrived with a group of 12 and our orders were taken almost immediately.  I ended up getting their chicken fajitas with double meat. I also asked that all the fun stuff (i.e. sour creams, guacamole, beans, rices, cheese, etc) be put on another plate. One last request was to have my chicken clean meaning no seasoning added.  After what seems like an eternity to get our food, I got half my request right.  Some, not all, items were put on another plate.  But I got my chicken clean, which is the most important.  Taste wise, I was satisfied and know it would have been better if I had the fun stuff added.  Our waitress was great and our server pleasant.  Overall, I have no complaints about Cabo.   TIPS: -Chips:  I didn't try at this location, but have tried it at other Cabo's.  I don't know what it is about their chips, but they are addicting.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (422/500)"}
{"text":"Hit this place up for happy hour yesterday.  Happy hour menu is $3/$4/$5.  Drinks and food at each price point but it's only good in the bar and when I got there at 5:30, the bar was bumping.    I tried the guacamole (only $4 on happy hour!).  Nothing spectacular but the good thing was that the chopped jalapenos were on the side.  My friend is not into spicy food and I am, so I just added a ton to my guac on my plate.  Woo-hoo!  Service was just okay as were some of the appetizers we tried.  But I will definitely come here again for a cheap margarita and awesome chips and salsa."}
{"text":"After over a 5 year hiatus, I decided to give Cabo another try last night and I'm sorry to say it was still a massive disappointment. While it filled my belly, my latest experience reminded me why I haven't eaten here since 2010. In a town with so many great Mexican food options, I can't understand why anybody would choose to dine here. I know, lots of you probably have coupons, comps, etc., but I don't think I'd come back to eat here even for free.   The dining room itself is nice and open with fun decor. The atmosphere is lively and fine (and it's NOT smoky although it's inside Sunset Station and right off the casino floor). The hostess was friendly and we were seated quickly.   The service was fine but not great. It took a long time to be greeted at the table by our server but the busboy brought over some chips, salsa and bean dip (all just okay). Our waiter was super-heavily cologned. I don't mean he was wearing cologne, I mean he was doused up so heavily that when he dropped off our drinks, you could smell his cologne on our glasses! Whenever he came over to check on us, his smell lingered on far after he had vacated our area. He smelled nice but whoa, did he spill the entire bottle of Axe Body Spray on himself? Yikes!  The star of the show here is the salsa bar. There's a large bar with chips, bean dip, and lots of different salsas. You can help yourself to anything up there, so if you are like me and NEVER seem to have enough pico de gallo with your meal, you'll be a happy camper. I loaded plate after plate with heaping mounds of pico and it was awesome. Some of the salsas are pretty good, I'll give them that. But a salsa bar can't save this place.  We ordered the queso dip, steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas. The queso arrived first. It was in a big bowl (huge portion) but something wasn't quite \"right\" about it. It wasn't a large bowl of melty real cheese, and it wasn't even melted Velveeta. It had an almost powdered milk taste and consistency. It was one of the worst \"queso\" dips I have ever had. It was just plain nasty. I can't figure out what the heck was in it but it was maybe 1% cheese. I eat queso at every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and this stuff was awful. Skip it.   Next up came our fajitas. We had asked for a side of vegetables instead of the rice and beans. It's nice that you can sub the veggies with no additional charge, but the veggies were a complete afterthought. I was hoping for some nice peppers and zucchini, but what we got was basically a glorified plate of canned corn. Yuck. The fajitas were fine but the meat wasn't properly seasoned. The vegetables were cooked well but tasted mostly of salt. The prices were ridiculous considering the miniscule portions (my fajitas had 8 small shrimp for $15.99). A plus side for low carb diners is that the menu even states that you can get lettuce cups instead of tortillas with your fajitas and tacos, so score a star for that!    I'm just not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"The food was great! I especially enjoyed the self service salsa bar. They have all kinds of salsa, refried beans an chips. I also had a frozen coconut margarita. It was yummy and refreshing. My meal was the combination of three; steak taco, shredded beef enchilada, and shredded beef burrito. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I got. This is a great place to go to if you have an opportunity. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"To be fair I'm not big on Mexican food, but I ordered a tostada salad and figured it can't be that bad. Ugh, wrong. Not really at all how I had pictured it in my head. The crunchy shell was not a bowl but a little flat shell pasted to a large plate with black beans. The salad itself looked like it went through a blender. I tried to ask for it without tomatoes, but since I make it a point not to talk to peoples' back's I didn't get a chance to. Since it was blended it was a nightmare picking them out.   Service was nothing amazing but I guess they did the job. I hate the uniforms they give these poor girls. While the men wore normal long sleeve button ups the gals are stuck with ill fitting tank tops. I thought empire waistlines were supposed to be flattering but sadly no. I would understand if they were cocktail girls but these are food service workers. I don't need to see someones armpit while a plate is being set in front of me. Maybe it's just me, but it's a food turnoff. One bonus star for the four different dips that come at the start of the meal, hooray for variety, at least they filled me up since the salad was a miss."}
{"text":"Food was decent, chips and salsa were good! The bartender was an ass though, we are waiting for a table for 7 so sat at the bar while waiting. I put my players card into the video poker machine, order a maggie and am getting ready to put money in when she puts the drink down and says $8.50? I'm gambling, isn't the drink free? No, you haven't put your money in yet so you have to pay for it, I said no thanks! I will put my money in and order another, she says whatever and gives me stink eye the rest of the night? Oh well they should hire cute friendly bartenders rather than a skanky short hair bleach blond with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews!  This place is terrible.  The entire experience is not enjoyable.  From the bad attitude of Tina at the hostess station and the slow service of Jose.  It's all terrible.  Food sucks.  Just go to Taco Bell and save yourself the headache.  Same food quality and a whole lot quicker."}
{"text":"Really good mexican food....love the four different dips for chips. The enchiladas and fajitas were excellent. Recommended!"}
{"text":"When you have a craving for Mexican food and Roberto's just isn't going to cut it, come to Cabo.  Thats what I did.  I wanted the sit down experience with chips and salsa that the taco shops in Las Vegas just don't offer.  Cabo was near by was sounding pretty good.    I was seated immediately when I came in around 5:45 Monday evening.  I was given my choice of sitting at the bar (which looked to be full), a table or at a booth. I went with the table.  I was informed of the salsa bar near by and told chips would be brought out to me shortly.  It took longer than I thought it should have.  I saw a lot of staff walk by me and not bring my chips.  They did come out eventually though and they were fine.  The salsa that was brought with them was very good.  It tasted almost roasted.  The bean did brought out was also good.  I never did make it to the salsa bar to try the other options.  My entree was brought out before I could finish a basket of chips.  It was nice that the food service was so quick.  I ordered a two item combo with a pork tamale with green sauce and a chicken chimi taquito (flauta).  I was given the choice of black beans or refried beans.  I went with the black beans.  They are more earthy and satisfying to me.  The black beans were the last thing I ate.  The first thing I noticed was the red sauce on my tamale when I am certain I asked for green sauce.  This kind of mistake is really not worth fussing over so I ate my tamale as it was presented.  And it was good.  The masa was a little on the dense side but the flavors were good and there was a good amount of pork to balance the masa.  I was not happy with my chimi taquito.  There was no sauce with it. No gucamole.  No sour cream.  It could have benefited from something as it was dry.  The chicken filling was sparse and the flavor was off.  The flour tortilla picked up too much of the fry oil.  It was like fair food.  I would get a different second item were I to go back and order a 2 item combo again."}
{"text":"I was coming to Santa Fe Station for a movie and fully expected to eat at Capriotti's or Fat Burger before hand.  However, upon seeing the $7.99 all you can eat taco special on the marquee, I came to Cabo instead.  It was not busy and I was seated immediately.  I waited a couple of minutes for my iced tea and chips and salsa to come out all the while knowing what I was going to order.  The waiter took my order and a few minutes late my food arrived.  It was fast.  Almost too fast.  It made me question the freshness of the food.  But the black beans were great.  And I am glad they offer a black bean option, by the way.  The rice was good as well.  As for the tacos, I started with one each, chicken, shredded beef, and ground beef.  The first bite led to my ground beef taco exploding in my hand and dipping down to my elbow.  The sign of a good taco in my book.  Despite the generic spiced beef and pre-made crunchy corn tortilla shell, this was still a good taco.  The shredded beef was not as good, actually.  Too fatty for my liking.  The chicken was a close second behind the ground beef.  Had I been able to squeeze a wedge of lime on it or if it had more flavor to begin with, the chicken taco would have been my favorite of the evening.  Still, it was good so I ordred one more chicken and one more ground beef.  They came up as quickly as the first three did.  And by the end of the evening, I was thankful for the speedy service as the movie I was seeing started less than an hour after I first arrived.  Good service, a good deal, and acceptable food started the night off right."}
{"text":"Not my choice to even come to Palace Station for any reason but my friend wanted to go to the Oyster Bar.  I actually heard really great things about it.  However, we were on a time crunch and the line was long and the only thing open in the casino was Cabo Mexican Restaurant.  The only reason they even get 1 star is because I got my chips and salsa in a timely manner, and the manager gave us a free round of drinks and 20% off our bill at the end.  They really should get zero stars though.  Our drinks took forever at the bar, my friend's steak was way over cooked,  the waitress was slow, the ambience was not great, I can go on forever."}
{"text":"Tableside guac.....BOMB!  In my opinion, there's one thing that keeps me a loyal patron.....it's in a casino-bleh, the servers are average in a good way.  BUT that GUAC, is to die for. I will walk a mile to get in and deal with the stench of cigarette smoke to have the opportunity to dive into that green goodness. Really that's all you need to know."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant in a locals casino with elegant ambiance  featuring a circular bar front and center, has surprisingly good food at decent prices (around $9.99- $11.99 per entree). It doesn't feel like your typical Mexican restaurant inside- it feels very contemporary. The staff doesn't wear traditional costumes, either.    This was part one (lunch) of my double-header in-law birthday celebration a couple weekends ago on a saturday afternoon (my husband's parents have birthdays on consecutive days). My MIL had a restaurant.com certificate so we wanted to try this place too. The last few birthdays were spent at a Mexican restaurant too BTW. Anyway, service was on the slow side. It wasn't even crowded; there were a few other parties besides us, but it was far from being busy.   The salsa and chips were really good. I like the spicy one and mixed some bean dip in one bowl with it, when the server brought us more. My husband got the chicken fajita burrito (came with rice and beans), I got the sampler (I couldn't really make up my mind so I chose something with lots of choices- beef nachos, cheese dip, cheese quesadillas, 4 taquitos, and 4 chicken wings), my MIL's husband got the taco combo plate (also came with rice and beans), and my MIL got the beef fajitas. My husband's burrito was so big that he only ate half! It kinda looked like a football. My nachos were good, but because I had chips and salsa, I did not finish it. The taquitos were really good, but then again, I love cilantro (hubby's not a fan). The cheese dip was in a good sized bowl- my husband liked it alot, and I gave half to my MIL to take home. The quesadillas were good, but it's hard to mess up something kinda basic. The chicken wings I didn't touch but offered it up to my husband and MIL, who then said it didn't have too much flavor and was heavily battered (I try not to eat chicken wings these days.)  My MIL's beef fajitas were really good- the beef was so buttery soft, that I might order that the next time we go here (this is saying something since I'm not huge on red meat, I'll eat it if it's there, but I don't have to have it; I eat chicken on most days). My MIL's husband finished his tacos. We were all full but we indulged in fried ice cream afterward (what's a birthday without dessert?).  So basically my high marks are based on the salsa, and food overall at reasonable prices, since the service could've been better, considering there were just a few other parties besides us. He checked on us once during the whole meal. And we might check it out again if we have a certificate."}
{"text":"Cabo is fubar. My experience there was fubar.   We went on an employee appreciation night, so it was pretty packed.   In the beginning, I thought our server was crappy and I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt since it was employee appreciation night. I thought maybe she was just getting crappy customers and crappy tips all night long. By the end of the night, I was just convinced that she was a crappy server.   When we got to our table, it smelled vaguely of vomit (I'm not sayin' someone vomited there ... it just smelled like someone vomited there), there was a huge puddle of something on the ground beneath the table, and my chair was sticky. We asked the hostess if we could get the puddle mopped up. They very politely obliged.   After we got seated, our server came by to take our drink order. After that, there were unacceptably long intervals between her visits.   The food was really bad, not seasoned well, hardly Mexican. Maybe Mexican inspired. For the food and service we got, we should have been paying Del Taco prices.   If you order a double size of any margarita, you get to keep the glass. Classy.   * off the strip"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem of Mexican restaurants! My wife and I are picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants, and this city has enough bad ones to overwhelm anyone. We used to live pretty close to Sunset Station, and decided to try this place after a movie. We had pretty low expectations and we were quickly blown away. First, its easy to fill yourself up on the complimentary chips and salsa bar. There are at least 10 different salsas plus bean dip and mole for you to enjoy. All the salsas are freshly made and each has a distinct flavor. Second, the prices on the entrees are really unbeatable for nicer casual Mexican places. Third, the food portions are huge! Considering the free chips and salsa, its really easy to get two meals out of one entree. Fourth, the  food quality is great! Everything tastes fresh and is very flavorful, which is definitely contrary to the many bland dishes you can find at other restaurants. Finally, we've been several times (at least a dozen) over the past 2 years, and we have always had great service.  We aren't fans of many of the restaurants in Station Casinos, but this one is definitely worth it.  We are vegetarians, and the staff at Guadalajara is very willing to accommodate our requests."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this is Not Spectacular just OK ..........pretty Americanized but the food has decent flavors! They do have good prices and good salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This 2 stars is for the LOONNGG wait. We've been coming here for a couple years now and is always ok when Jose us here. We were sat in the outside bar area and pretty much forgotten about. I truly hate giving low star ratings but they have really got to get it together."}
{"text":"SPECIAL 3 item combos $8.99 + $3 Margaritas!! plus Chips & salsa plus bean dip for FREE-At all @stationcasinos  We visited Palace Station around 10pm Friday Evening and there was no wait to be seated during the #UNLVmbb game.   Service was fast & friendly bringing drinks & chips/salsa out almost immediately. I ordered my regular the carne asada fajitas and the wife got a 3 item combo of beef enchilada,beef taco and something mexican.  As you can see from whats pictured NOT what you think when you think fajitas, right? I'm thinking slightly sauteed peppers & onions , medium rare finely sliced carne asada with tortillas, pico and sour cream,guac on the side maybe even some cilantro and HOT sauce.  Really cheap and cheesy. meat was tough and NOT marinated like you'd expect. Didn't even touch the rice & beans just didn't pass the look test.   sidenote:  The sides pico/sour cream/guac were in the same small bowl and watered together-not very cool either.  How this place has failed to find someone to cook good mexican food in Las #Vegas boggles the mind."}
{"text":"cabo's is a mexican restaurant with a nightclub feel. big screens everywhere. lots of help & lots of partiers. there is a bar right when you enter and booths all along the main wall. the atmosphere is very comfy & busy. the service is impeccable-fast,friendly and very helpful. the food is great. chips & dips for free and all the entrees are good. we usually do fajitas,chimichangas,enchiladas and taco salad. very suprising for a casino. nice & spicy. fresh & hot! (at palace station) don't go. what a mistake thinking the same place in the palace station would have the same quality of food. the menu is the same-the decor is old-mexican with a cantina(tables & chairs) in the front. no tv's in the restaurant. the chips were stale. the salsa was not fresh. and of course the entrees-suuuuucked!! cold-bland and awful-taste like everything at the palace station!! i would go to the red rock!!"}
{"text":"I didn't really expect to eat good Mexican Food in a sketchy hotel off the strip in Vegas. My assumptions were not wrong.  The food was average.  Nothing to celebrate or recommend but a decent meal in a hotel where the other option is a buffet or Jonny Rockets to go.  The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.  We were constantly asking for my water, chips and for them to take our order.  I don't enjoy restuarants where I have to do more work to get them to do their job.   Granted, this place was a nice escape from the outside environment of a gross off the strip hotel. But please, don't expect much"}
{"text":"This was one of the first places I went to dinner when I moved here, and over the past couple years, I came here for one thing: the table side guacamole. My most recent visit, we were greeted by a young man that completely lacked the social skills for the position he was in. He mumbled every word and acted as if we inconvenienced him by showing up and spending some money. I won't be back any time soon because as it turns out, right up the street there is another Station Casino with a restaurant very similar to Cabo called Amigos. Even the menu is the same, but some of the food is actually cheaper, and so far the service has been fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep it simple.  $7.99 for unlimited tacos and rice and chips and salsa, I'm already sold!  Chicken Taco - 4/5 very good, a little dry...not as good as my moms home cookin Beef Taco - 2.5/5 it's okay, was very soggy and wasn't memorable Shredded beef taco - 4.9/5, sooooo good I'm a fan, I would just come here and order those forever if I could. Pink Taco - 1/5, taste life fish, very disappointed   Get a sense of humor :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place!! My husband & I went here tonight & were really dissatisfied. I got a chimichanga & it was full of rice on the inside with very little chicken or anything else. He likes rice so he was ok with his burrito having it. It was still a lot! Plus the meals had rice on the side of the plate too. Service was normal, nothing exceptional. They also charged $3.50 for a small side of guacamole. Will not be in a hurry to go back here unfortunately"}
{"text":"The three stars here don't represent a real review.  Oh, I had all intentions of writing a review for this place.  We set out to go here, later than most people, as usual.  We planned on taking advantage of the 9.99 fajita-with-margarita special, and wanted to make sure it was still available.   So we get to Red Rock and I check in on Yelp.  I have to do that BEFORE we actually enter the casino, because my Yelp app won't work on my phone inside.  We go to Cabo, and here's where the stupidity ensues:  instead of just asking someone who works there, we stand in front of it looking at the illuminated billboard that has their menu.  The fajita special had just flashed by, so we waited...and waited...as the billboard s-l-o-w-l-y cranked through each page of the substantial menu.  At last, THAT page appeared, for just a second, but long enough to see that the special didn't have time constraints like \"served from 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.  Great!  We walk past the bar and up to the desk, where the young woman cleaning menus says:  \"Oh, we just closed!\"  Foiled again!  Off to the Grand Cafe.  I will update this, now that I know that they close at 9:00 p.m., much to early for a casino restaurant, IMHO."}
{"text":"OK first off i love Mexican food.  i have been here many times. the food is very good and the service is great. i usually have the burrito but this last time i had the steak quesadilla. very satisfying. the waitress was exceptional. the only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that the bowls at the salsa bar are so god damn small...they are so small you cant get a whole chip in them. I'm a huge fan of chips and salsa so id like a bowl bigger than thimble.  other than that id go again and again"}
{"text":"I thought I wad going to dislike this place just because it was a casino restaurant but I was dead wrong. The tomatillo and avocado salsa and jalepeno rojo were great! I got the shredded chicken crispy tacos and the shrimp bacon appetizer was awesome too. I saw the fajita plate on its way out to my gf and she said it was really good too.perfect place to take the family."}
{"text":"The chips were very fresh and tasty, and the accompanying salsa and bean dip were also quite good. We ordered the table-side guacamole, and it was quite yummy also. The entrees were somewhat disappointing, just average. My rice and beans were on the dry side and didn't have a lot of flavor. The shrimp in my shrimp tacos were not very fresh but were okay. For the price, it's about right, but we were hoping for something a little more."}
{"text":"The service is friendly but the food here is no bueno. Fajitas and lime shrimp should not be that hard but both had little flavor. The shrimp were huge but just lacked any oomph of excitement. The salsas were better, and you get 4 different kinds!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant to go to. Got a quick drink from the bar to past time.  I ordered the Paloma. It's a tequila based cocktail made with grapefruit soda. I also added salt to the rim of the glass because tequila can have a strong tase. The bar was very clean and the bartender was very nice."}
{"text":"The staff made a mistake and brought us 2 appetizer platters. Upon the manager, Helen's notice, she came and took the second platter only to throw it away rather than let us enjoy it....and it was their mistake. I would not recommend this restaurant due to its horrible customer service."}
{"text":"For some bizarre reason my wife likes this place, and I don't know why. So I end up here once every 6 months or so, and every time the food gets a little worse. It was decent for super Americanized Mexican food years ago, but everything from the burritos to the tacos is just bad now. The service however has stayed the same this whole time, but as it started out awful, that's not saying much"}
{"text":"Nice little place.   I have walked by it several times but today was the first time I decided to dine there solo on a whim, I am glad I did.    Seated immediately, all the staff were very nice and the food was super fast.  Chips with dip and water were prompt. Granted it was not busy while I was there (around 4:30).  I ordered a quesadilla and it arrived before my drink!  Very fast. The chicken quesadilla was pretty good.  I recommend it, the drink not so much.  It was a corona margarita where they tip a beer into a margarita and it is held inverted to drain as you drink.   Interesting for sure, never seen such a thing so I wanted to try it.  Maybe some people like it but not my thing, that's really not their fault.   Overall it was great.  I will definitely be back, next time with someone else to try more stuff even if I am not gambling."}
{"text":"The chips are always cold. I'm used to that. However this time the experience was made even worse by a harried, rushed waitress that refused to write anything down, thus the order when we finally got it, was wrong. The food takes way too long here for them to make mistakes. So we waited and waited and waited while one of our party had his food so he ate, and the rest of us sat. I finally walked over to the manager, Maria Lepe and told her our dinner experience was pretty much ruined due to part of our party getting the food and the rest of us not, I also told her our chips were cold. She never apologized she came to our table to ''get the full story'' so another member of our party explained again how our order was wrong, and still not here. Then Maria said ''Let me get the story from your waitress'' as if we were making this up or mistaken or something. Very rude. Very unprofessional.   Maria then brought our ticket back to the table and said we had not waited that long, she argued with us. Our food finally got there and the enchiladas were barely luke warm, you would think if food took that long it would come out pipping hot but this wasn't. Maria continued to defend her side, never once said she was sorry.   This was my last trip here. Cold chips, medium warm food and rude, unprofessional management is enough to never make me go back."}
{"text":"I must admit I was so excited to go here for the all you can eat tacos special or $7.99. However, this review is mostly about the service, which eclipsed the food tenfold.   Admittedly, we got there a little bit late (about an hour before close), but does that mean that we're not entitled to good service? Our server Jim seemed to think so.   Jim stumbled to the table conspicuously inebriated and probably more than 3 sheets to the wind (I think he probably had his whole linen closet blowing in his boozy breeze).  However, the Cadillac  margaritas that we ordered WEAK! Perhaps it's because Jim had sucked all the alcohol off of the top before he served them to us. When I personally brought them back to the bartender for a redo (Jim was nowhere to be found),  the bartender really had no interest in doing anything other than cleaning up the bar so he could get home.  We spoke to the manager about honoring the AYCE deal that was listed on Yelp, however he said the promotion had expired and that only the I.T. guy was responsible for internet promotions. I guess you can't expect much from the MANGER or anything like that, right? This man was built like a Sprinter Van, and if Jim was drinking all the restaurant's profits, the manager had obviously been offered his paycheck in the form of burritos and tacos and enchiladas...which he GLADLY accepted. He still refused to honor Yelp deal, so we opted for the fajitas for two special that was going on at the time.   Here's the good news. Jim left before he was done serving us (we saw him later in the pub getting cozy with a cold one at the bar), so Lucy took over. She was amazing and attentive, but sadly it was the end of our meal, so we didn't get to experience the extent of her awesomeness. Another busser named Do also seemed genuinely happy to be doing his job, too! He was also quite helpful.  The food was mediocre, but I do love that they bring a tasty bean dip to the table. I probably will come back to another of the Stations Casinos Cabos, but definitely not Palace Station.    I had more fun at karaoke at  Jack's Irish pub that night. Singing Tina Turner songs made me feel better!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just don't want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out. Cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions. Last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that we've become accustomed to. Our server, Daniel flat knows how to move things along and once again he took great care of us. I didn't have to ask for refills on my drink, and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before I even started to get up to head to the salsa bar for more. It's the little things. They make a huge difference. And with a 2 year old along when making the tableside guacamole he didn't just assume what ingredients should be left out. He asked. That was appreciated.   In short, another solid 4 star experience. It's not 5 stars, but sometimes you don't want 5 stars, you want consistent 4 star, rock solid food and a hassle free experience. Cabo delivers that for us.   One tip: On the AYCE tacos, be aware of the restrictions. No sharing, no doggie bags, batteries not included. Oops, scratch the last one. Still we ordered the non AYCE tacos. Only was able to eat 2 anyway. Just thought I'd share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy. In that case order away. It just means I have time to get to the salsa bar before you do!   One last thing: The mobile app should show more check-ins, not sure what is up with that."}
{"text":"Cabo is predictable. Good quality Mexican food prepared promptly, without fuss. The tableside guacamole is memorable and the all you can eat tacos special is a very good deal. Service could be a bit better, our server was bussing tables, and cleaning as well as serving food and earned a good tip as we were impressed at how well he kept things running. I don't blame the server I blame management for not staffing appropriately. We ordered ice tea to drink which was kinda ho-hum and they didn't have sugar to sweeten it. It's just one of those things. In short...it's casino food but at Station Casinos flagship property. It's missing the seriously good salsa bar that the Cabo at Sunset Station has...but overall you won't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Never been here before so we decided to try a little something new. Didn't have any actual food, just sat at the bar, had drinks and chips and salsa. The salsa bar was AYCE and has lots of choices.  Our bartender Ivan was the absolute best. He took great pride in the drinks he made and his customer service was service to none."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite during happy hour. I ordered a strawberry mojito and it was one of the best I have ever had. It was only $4 bucks. I also ordered some taquitos. They sure came out fast! They were very good and plenty of them. I had to bring the hubby back the next day as our pre-Weezer drinking spot since the HH prices are pretty amazing. We were able to find a spot at the bar and get lit up before the show for so cheap! It was awesome. Service was great and the drinks were even better. I have set up a mommy's night out here the end of the month I like it so much."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow. Did not receive my appetizer and took 20 minutes for my free dessert with the Yelp coupon."}
{"text":"Freaking DELICIOUS!!! I have had the hardest time finding a decent Mexican restaurant since we've moved here but I think I've found it! Fantastic food service and margarita's!!"}
{"text":"*** PROS *** * Open late * Delicious fried ice cream * Seated and served promptly * Gambling nearby *** CONS *** * None TIP - NOT open for breakfast"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. Once the service was horrible and the manager just seemed like he didn't care.   We decided to go back again and give another try.   Service was ok. It seemed like we were sat outside of someone's section and was forgotten. But once she greeted us, things got better.   The margaritas are great!   The nachos are my favorite as far as nachos go because they are nice and thick. They won't break when you dip them! They also have a huge selection of salsas.  We had the table side guacamole and it is a must have if you go there.  I had the pork tamale and chicken taco combo. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The portions are pretty sizable too.   For the price, the food is great. I just wish the service would improve somewhat."}
{"text":"Overall the food was ok and the service was acceptable.  The main issue was that the server basically gave us the impression she wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  The place was less than half full on a Wed night and she was obviously rushing us.  Apps out, 5 mins later came salads, then mains.  Kept coming back to ask for dessert orders every 2 mins after we asked her for some time.  Let the customers relax please."}
{"text":"Food has always been good there and have always enjoyed eating there.   However, I will probably never eat at another restaurant inside that casino   After eating, I went to the restroom and watched one of the cooks from Cabo, in full uniform including a full apron walk in the restroom in front of me and go into a stall. How DISGUSTING!!!!  At the very least take off the apron."}
{"text":"Well our waiter John left a bad taste in our mouth. When he approached our table he did not introduce himself, but stood silently behind my husband until we noticed he was there. Since we were sitting by a half wall in front of the kitchen, he used that side of our table as the lazy way to deliver our drinks and appetizer plates. When asking about drinks he rolled his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. He made no effort to suggest drinks from the bar. We ordered appetizers that were delivered with our food so we ate cold nachos. He has not table touched since we received our food and it took over 5 minutes for a drink refill. Sorry Cabo, but we probably won't be back nor would we recommend our friends to eat here."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Complimentary chips, salsa, & beans were good and filling. Margaritas could've been bigger.. & stronger but they were good none the less. Keep your eye out for coupons... & groupons!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. Service was fast and friendly. Our sever Jose was the best always came to our table to make sure we we're ok. Will come back again and again!!!!! Love it"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at this place tonight. I read the reviews so I wanted to ck it out for myself since I live so close to Sunset Station. The restaurant has a feel to it, like its a real mex. rest.. not like its inside a casino. Indeed very romantic old school hacienda feel. I loved the ambiance.  FOOD:  I ordered pork tamales came in the husk with the red chile sauce and topped with Oaxacan cheese. ..which were good but a few bites in there were a smidge dry. It came with refried beans (or blk if u choose) and mex. rice. But.. I'd rather have dry than super greasy any day! ($9.99) My bf ordered the Carne Asada Platter $13.99 that came with beans/rice and  huge salad. I thought wow, nxt time I come I'm going to try their ckn tortilla soup and be good with that. They have a huge salsa bar which was really really good. They had avacado tomatillo salsa that was out of this world. I'd GO BACK just for that! omg. so good. No my bf won tonight b/c the carne asada was like butta it was soo smootha nd delicious. great flavor and not @ all fatty like I pictured it. It's kinda hard to get good carne asada out here. usually its pretty chewy, but this this place. They had really good food. I was so full I ended up taking most of this home.   DRINKS:  My bf ordered a regular house marg. $3.95 and I told the waiter I want a real marg. not the slushy pancake molasses aunt jamima marg. I want one that contains actual tequila! He brought me a cadillac margarita and it was gooooood I'd have ordered too but that one was $8.95 and I still had a lot of good food to try so I kept it to a min. of 1 for the night.   SERVICE: This is a great place and I think I will add it to the rotation. Oh and the waiter we had was great. His name was Dan, he was super cool and so was our water guy. I didnt catch his name but he recommended the flan nxt time we go or the sopapillas. I'm still too full to even think about that and I ate there hours ago.  A def. must try on the list for Henderson residents."}
{"text":"Let me say I'd been to Cabo @ Palace Station and wasnt that impressed but was willing to try it again since we were in the area on this rare occasion. (I live in Hendo)   SERVICE: they get one star deducted for service b/c this guy was a mute. I dont think he actually said more than\" everything ok?\" maybe once. If water was refilled, it was silent. Plates arrived, from someone else..and she warned Hot plate\". maybe there was a 2-3 syllable rule we werent told about...  FOOD: this is where they earned the star back. wow. damn. it was good. The chips first off were those super thick and delicious tostadas- which means u have to count each one you eat to not go overboard.Salsa came in the form of 3 types of salsa, 1 red, 1 molcajete brown salsa, 1 chile verde, and one bean dip. omg so freakin good  I ordered chicken fajitas, to die for. sheesh louise I ate all the chicken and veggies, no tortillas- but it came w/ guacamole and sour cream on the side w/ cilantro. so good.   my bf ordereed the chile relleno - it was good too but nowhere near the realm of goodness as mine. wow. im getting hungry just thinking of them but I already ate a late lunch.   Best part of this meal was the check. we had a $10 off coupon for any station casino they sent to us in the mail. Cant beat it. both our plates were around $12-14. so it was like a 2fer. Cant . beat. it."}
{"text":"This place is not one of my favorites but we were at Sunset Station and decided to go.  First off, I love that they have a salsa bar!  They have tons of different salsas and I always head there before I even sit down.  I just break off from the hostess and always have to find my way to our table with chips and salsa in hand.  The past two times I have gone, I got back to the table and there were chips and salsa waiting.  Why have a salsa bar AND bring chips to the table?  If you find out, let me know.  My big problem with this place is the chicken.  I'm not sure if they boil it or what but any chicken dish I have eaten here is dry and not too tasty.  They do fine cheese enchiladas but I think chicken at a Mexican restaurant should be top notch and at this place, it just isn't.  I don't have incredibly high standards for Mexican food and this place is alright.  Salsa Bar, Yes!  Chicken, No!"}
{"text":"For the Las Vegas area Cabo is a-ok. The service is friendly and their salsa fresca is great. I will come back but out of convenience not stellar food/service."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Our waiter told us there were no ripe avocados for guacamole. When our main dishes arrived two out of three of them had avocados which tasted fine and not hard. We later ordered guacamole from a bus person who brought some to us within two minutes. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Very sad....been coming here for many years.  Went last night was a casino credit....sadly to say the quality of food is horrible.   Wouldn't even go back for a free meal.   Chips are almost stale, not authentic.  Bean dip is tasteless.   Waited over an hour for food but server and manager were pleasant.   Definately can tell that they are more worried about their food cost over quality.  I am in the food business.  You will attract more customers who will be willing to pay a bit more for better quality  food.  Sorry.   You have lost a long time customer.   Try being a bit more authentic and detailed in food ingredients and finished product.       This place needs a LOT of help."}
{"text":"Love Cabo! Conveniently located off the freeway in the Santa Fe. Been coming here for years. Friendly staff, tasty food, great ambiance and decent prices!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends  last night for a late night meal after bowling.  It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away.  Horrible services, the waiter couldn't seem to get our order right, long wait for our drinks ( 2 beers, 2 ice teas) brought us the wrong food and left most if the skin on the avocados for our table side guacamole. Then the manager came by our table to say that we could put our bowling bags next to the table,  We would have to move then across the room. She stood next the table waving her hands and tapping her foot while embarrassing us in front of the other customers. So rude and unprofessional.  Not a good dinning  experience due to the staff... not really even worth 1 star."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was horrible.  It's sad when you have to ask 3 different times to get a side of sour cream and 20 minutes for a drink.  The wait staff dropped off my food and vanished.  Not sure if I was at a magic show or a restaurant.  The only thing I know for sure is that I will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Came in last week. As always the food was amazing! For the first time the service was really bad. I can't remember my servers name but I had not seen her there on previous visits. We were sat by hostess, a guy (not our server) brought chips n salsa. Waitress finally came by took drink order. We asked for two ice waters. We got to bottom of chips and still no water. I seen the manager (blonde) walking around greeting guests. I got up and asked her for the waters. She aplogised and said she would be right over with the waters. Never happened. Finally our waitress came over and was like oh I forgot your drinks, What did you order? We finally got our water after 20 mins. Then she came back and took our order. When we got our food a different waiter brought it out our food and it was great!! Then we didn't see our waitress for another period of time. When we finally did see her again she was hanging out with the manager chatting. I had to go up and ask for our check. So twice I had to get up and ask for something. I will be back I love the food and I'm hoping this was an one time thing on the bad service. But if this was my first experience with the restaurant I probably wouldn't be back.  *Picture is my waitress and manager hanging out as I waited for waitress to come by."}
{"text":"We had just checked into the Palace Station and it was kind of late so we didn't really want to go back out for dinner.  We looked at what was offered in the Casino.  Cabo had a special of a create your own combo meal for $8.99.  It looked pretty good, so we thought we would give it a try. First thing they bring you out complimentary Warm Chips and then some warm refried bean dip and 3 freshly made salsas.  A spicey roasted tomatoe, regular tomatoe and a green tomatillo.  The refried bean dip was warm and tasty and the other 3 seemed to be made very fresh.  My favorite was the Roasted, which had about MEDIUM HEAT. I asked how the Chili Relleno was and the waitress said that they are made fresh with a roasted chili that is then stuffed with cheese, rolled in flour and then fried.  I also ordered a steak carbaron(sp?) taco which was like a street style taco on a small corn tortilla with fresh onion and cilantro.  The combo also came with Rice and Beans. My wife had the Chili relleno and a pork tomale.  Lets just say, that based on the Chips and Salsa were very good and the rest of the food was even better.  Any who ventures to try a Chili relleno knows that they can be met with mixed results.  I had one one time that I swear was a Egg Omlet with Diced Green Chili's.  The one here was VERY, VERY good and had great taste.  Everything had great taste, even the black beans and the rice.  My expectations were not very high and had I looked at these YELP reviews prior to going, I'm sure I would have NOT GONE, but we were Oh so glad we did. If you are in the neighborhood or staying at the Palace station, I would highly recomend Cabo!  It was Muy Bien!!!!"}
{"text":"Well you know, there's times you need something south of the border. So I visited Cabo's at the Fe. Not bad, was what I expected. If I wanted something more authentic there are several to be found. But  there are plenty of times when an imitation will do just fine. I got the unlimited tacos and was happy with my meal."}
{"text":"I went here... THats about all i can say. MEDIOCRE"}
{"text":"Thursday Night: Cabo not full at all, but wait staff was RUSHED - talking so fast as to be incomprehensible, not wanting to discuss menu items or offer suggestions. Terrible service.  Half the food was good - OK, but the fajita was crappy, no seasoning on the onions/peppers - BLAND - too little salsa, sour creme, guacamole. Waitress did not check back to see how we were doing.  Desert - FLAN - was shitty. It was like frozen jello with spry cool whip  scattered around the plate. The sauce was almost sugar water.  All in all, SHITTY, not going back!  Evidently there is no management to let things get this out of hand.  Meanwhile the Charcoal Room, next door, is always a 5-start experience. MANAGEMENT Santa FE, Management!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with my Husband and Son.  We were seated right away. I had the combo plate with a cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. I substituted more rice for the beans. I also had a regular frozen margarita. Everything was very good and tasted fresh. We had pretty good service. I asked for a side of guacamole which was forgotten twice but I finally got it. All in all we had a very good experience."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat at bad restaurant at the Red Rock hotel. They're doing something right. I had a really satisfying meal at Cabo. Not to mention, HUGE. Talk about Las Vegas portions, all of the plates were bigger than my face.   This is the first Mexican restaurant I've been to that gives you 3 different salsas and refried beans with your tortilla chips to munch on before your meal. The beans were awesome although I was farting all night. I should have taken one of those Bean-O things, because supposedly \"there'll Bean-O gas.\" Anyway, it was worth it. 3 huge tacos w/ rice and beans for 12.99? Not too shabby.  Although I didn't quite feel like I was in Cabo, they don't rush you out of the door so it's a great place to come eat and hang out with friends for a couple hours. I also saw good number of people on dates here as well. I'll be back to eat at Cabo again since I'm at the Red Rock pretty often as of late."}
{"text":"We returned after a previous bad experience here. The management tried to correct the issues but is limited by their policies, they are evidently unable to do more then verbally admonish poor employees. The bartender made it clear he knew we had complained. He was unfriendly, unprofessional, and he  made our entire experience as uncomfortable as possible and we will not be returning. Plus, the bar was still filthy. You win."}
{"text":"Don't know why we like this particular Cabo over Palace or Santa Fe locations but we always seem to end up here on our visits back.  We never seem to get there in time for happy hour but pricewise it's on par with most chain places, with a little better quality.  Mom always said don't fill up on chips and salsa before dinner but she never had theirs, the spicier the better. Good enchiladas with plenty of cheese, fajitas were tasty too but easy on the onions next time.  Dessert options were so-so, we just had another margarita instead, I'm not big into fruit ritas but the strawberry hit the spot.  One drawback:  I don't expect every restaurant in Vegas to be 24 hours but the best you can do is 9 on weeknights? Just an idea..."}
{"text":"If you can avoid this place, do so. Not that I like to leave bad reviews but when your girlfriends ends up vomiting, your sister in law feels sick and myself the same. There must be something bad the food. The service was good, no complaints, even though the server forgot to bring us a margarita, at least he didn't try to charge it and then we changed our minds. So good thing he forgot it completely haha.   The food though, the beans tasted as if they were canned beans and the rice was dry and very old. The rest of the food did not have a good taste, it was blah."}
{"text":"Cheap and good are the two words that come to mind. I was rather fond of my $12 tender, chicken fajitas and $4.75 Modelo. I would do it again. And, thus, though I generally avoid the half-star math, I do think it was a 3.5 star meal.   The reasons it didn't push through to a 4-star: 1. The atmosphere. I am not sure why exactly, but the main dining area makes me feel like I am in a college dining room. They have a back room for private events that is spacious and filled with light, but the front space lacks character.  2. Chips and salsa. The salsa trio didn't light my fire.  3. Delayed greet. This is one of my odd pet peeves with service. It really bothers me when it takes longer than 30 seconds to be greeted by my server, and here, it took several minutes. Once we were greeted, service was good, but first impressions matter!  Overall, it was a good meal. Like I said, I would do it again."}
{"text":"In a word...this experience was underwhelming.  I remember coming to Cabo back when they first opened, years ago, and just LOVING the food. Have my tastes matured that much, that what once was awesome, and worth a 40 minute wait for a table just isn't anymore?  Sure, I think maybe they've matured a little, but I really think its just a drop in standards.   The whole night at Cabo was underwhelming, from the time we approached the hostess till we left, with the important exception of the service.  Our server was amazing, and the manager, after a bit of a misunderstanding in a complaint, was very receptive to criticism and feedback.  We arrived at the hostess station at about 6:35pm, and were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait...when there were plenty of open seats. We asked if we could just sit at a bar top, and she said that the servers were busy and had to catch up on their tables.  Ok, strike one, horribly understaffed.    Then we noticed the time, and noticed that their happy hour ends at 7pm every day.   Are they trying to seat us late so we don't take advantage of happy hour?  Not that there was a lot on the HH menu that we wanted but still...  Luckily, we were seated at about 6:50 (ten minutes to spare) and got our order of wings in for $5.  Our server, like I said before, was a treasure.  She was pleasant, and kept my water glass full the whole night.  It took a while to get our chips and salsa, which we discovered was because the kid bringing the chips was also the ONLY busser we saw on the floor...which brings in to question:  How are their sanitary practices?  The same guy who is bussing dirty dishes is bringing out our chips and salsa...no gloves.  Hm.  The chips were good, but the salsas were a little...boring.  Another stations property has a Mexican restaurant with a salsa bar, and a MUCH better selection of salsa's.  Boring, and disappointing.    So our wings arrived, and they were standard wings...nothing to write home about.  When our entrees arrived, that was where the problems started occurring.   My chimi fajita:   This thing is ENORMOUS.  Like...ridiculously huge, fed me at dinner last night and lunch today, and I STILL didn't eat the whole thing.   It was served with refried beans and cheese, Mexican rice, and a \"garnish\" of pico de gallo.  The pico was laughable.  If you're serving me pico, I want enough to put ON my chimichanga, and there wasn't enough on the plate for the first bite.    As far as the flavor goes...it started off mediocre, with mostly just vegetables on the end.  As I got closer to the middle, I found the chicken ,and that was actually pretty nice.    My fella ordered the steak fajitas, and was REALLY disappointed. First of all, he ordered them with NO sour cream...and received his bowl of pico with sour cream in it.    Second, on the fajita platter, there was ONE lonely, tiny stalk of cilantro.  One.  It was mostly stem too, no leaves.   Worse of all though...the steak was bland!  We could have dropped it on the floor and stepped on it, and it would have had more flavor.   At this point, we asked our server to speak to a manager.  When we told her about the steak being bland, I think she may have misunderstood what we were trying to do, and she said \"What would you like me to do to the steak.\"   Uh...yeah.  We got a little angsty after that bit, and stepped up our game, letting her know that we were simply trying to provide feedback, that the quality of the food was bland.  For advertising that the steak is marinated, it didn't taste that way at all.  After we explained ourselves a bit better, she was VERY apologetic, and offered to take the fajitas off the check (that wasn't  our goal, but since he didn't eat much of it, it was a nice offer that we accepted), and told us how much she valued our feedback.  The best part though, was that she came back out to the table after taking the food back, and said that she tried the steak, and that it WAS bland.    So the good news is, if she is true to her word, and she seemed like she is the kind of person who cares about her business, she should get on the chefs to season their meat better.   I was torn about giving Cabo 3 stars simply for her change of heart, but at the end of the day, the food just wasn't very good at all.   I don't know that I'd come back here again, really...its on the other side of town, and there are better restaurants, but if I'm here and with someone who wants to come out, I probably won't say no.  I'd like to see if they actually make improvements."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. Not much on the menu. I had the chicken taquitos, tried the bean and salsa dips which were very plain. Tried their Cadillac lime margarita which was tasty- not too strong. The service was great, my waitress was very friendly. Overall, I probably won't come around for seconds, but if you have a players card you get 10 points for every dollar and would probably get a meal free next time around."}
{"text":"We have been going to Cabo for years since moving to northwest Vegas and I am sad to say that this is probably the last time. Quality of the food is just not there anymore. My family ordered the beach party appetizer, chicken tortilla soup, and fajitas for dinner last night. When the chile con queso dip says \"queso \" you would think there would be some resemblance to cheese. Nope. What we got was something that taste like butter flavored melted cream sauce. No tomato or chile as in their description. The other items on the platter was medioacre at best. Hubby says fajita was ok. At least the soup was good but beyond disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried Cabo's bar area a couple times while waiting for my friends to arrive for a movie or dinner at another restaurant, so I'm not really familiar with their full menu.  Their margaritas are rather potent, and they're kind enough to Chip & Dip you if you're just sitting at the bar.  I can't imagine what their 45 oz. margarita would do to a person, but they have the option to destroy yourself with it there.    I was treated to a smash-up of their drink menu the other day in smaller form, and their strawberry mojito is the best thing I've had from Cabo!  Next time I'll have to order that to cool off from the 108* we're all roasting at."}
{"text":"Strolled in after a 9pm session of bingo. Got a Boarding pass earlier in the day and utilized it to get the fajita dinner for 8.99... Only 3 dollars cheaper with the cars but oh well. Had to buy a drink with the deal. Margaritas were below average.  Small glass   Tons of ice.. Not strong at all.   We asked for salt on my glass and i got sugar. She wanted sugar and got salt.  Wouldn't have been a big deal if we had gotten the same flavor.. Food was food tho.   Bean dip comes with chips and salsa complimentary . I wanna try all you can eat tacos"}
{"text":"Cabo is my go-to neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Their queso and chips are the best in town! If they allowed me to call in my order, then I would get their queso daily. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but definitely weekly. The combination plates are decent too. I can easily make two meals out of a three-item combo. The servers get you in and out in a timely manner, and most servers are very cool. I generally dine here when I get a Station's Casino coupon in the mail to save a few dineros."}
{"text":"Okay, yes, a decent salsa bar, but everything else was sub-par. First of all, we waited FOREVER for everything and it was so not a peak time or that busy. And the food; ohh boy. Maybe I misread the menu, but where I'm from carne asada enchiladas doesn't mean premade cheese enchiladas with a few overcooked strips of steak on top. It came with a small portion of beans and rice that I gobbled down quickly. The meal followed a super boring, hardly edible salad that I took two bites of and pushed aside. The house dressing was of a watery tomatoey variety. But yeah, the enchiladas were pretty tasteless, especially for $14.99.   My boyfriend was appalled that his taco shells were soggy and there was like 4 pieces of shredded cheese atop sad pieces of chicken. He commented that we could have made much better tacos at home. Never again.   The other Mexican restaurant in this casino, the counter service one, is actually good, just a tip! Go there!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are pretty good, but don't bother with the food. Food is pretty plain, nothing to really write about. We ordered steak nachos and the crispy tacos. Glad we didn't actually pay for the Meal and drinks (comped)! Probably wouldn't come back. Robertos by my house is much better :P"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The table side guacamole is wonderful. Waitstaff is always polite and quick to assist. And the beer is always cold. Thank you. Our friends from Ohio and Oklahoma loved it as well."}
{"text":"We tried this place mainly because of its close proximity to home (it's always nice to have good places to go that are close). There was a long wait, which I don't blame them for, but they handled it poorly. I had to return to the hostess twice to get a pager to continue our wait. Once seated, the service was good, hence the second star. The food was mediocre, right down the middle, neither good nor bad. The drinks were similar. The problem was that the prices were on the high end, so unless you're starving I'd recommend finding a different place."}
{"text":"This was our first, and last time eating here. Where do I begin? Initially we came here to kill time before seeing a movie ( Btw, the movie was A Quiet Place and it was great!) I asked for a drink menu, the waitress said they didn't have one. First red flag, had I seen a drink menu, I would have seen that they charge $12 per margarita.  For that price I expect delicious,  expertly crafted drinks. Nope. Basic margaritas you could probably get from a can with a TON of ice and very little actual drink. Now comes the chips , which were somewhat stale and the salsa was meh. Then we ordered our food. Our dinners were suppose to come with salads. After drinking our over priced BASIC margaritas, our entrees arrived. We asked our waitress what happened to our salads. Her response was basically \"Oops,  do you want me to wrap it to go?\" Like we're going to eat salads in the theatre? Now, the food. I took one bite of the fish in diablo sauce and immediately sent it back. It tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato paste, splashes some hot sauce in it, and tried to pass it off as authentic Mexican cuisine. By that point I didn't want to eat anything more from there and asked that my meal be taken off the bill. So for 2 dinners, 1 kids meal and 4 margaritas,  over $100 for mediocre food. We don't mind spending $$ when the food and service is great, but we would have been better off going to Del Taco. Not to mention, both my hubby and I had a mean case of the Hershey squirts the whole next day!! Oh well, at least the movie was good."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you want to have a conversation with the party you are with.  Girls night out is always at Cabo Mexican Restaurant in the Santa Fe.  We like to sit at the bar, have a drink or two, play some video poker and talk.  On Wednesday, we sat down and immediately noticed the music was extremely loud, like it is in the casinos on the Strip or Fremont St.  The manager was making the rounds and asked how we were.  I said, we'd be a lot better if we could hear ourselves talking....what was with the LOUD music.  She apologized and said it's a new policy from upper management.  They want the music to be heard into the casino area to help entice customers.  I then asked if it was possible to turn it down a little....it's a Wednesday night, \"SENIOR CITIZEN\" day and most of the customers are over 50, probably a little hard of hearing and really don't enjoy the music blasting over their conversations.  We were told \"management\" would not allow it and do walk by and signal if the music isn't loud enough in the casino (which, by the way, has it's own piped in music going out there).   I am hard of hearing and had a tough time hearing our bartender and a hard time hearing my friends.  The manager said it was exceptionally loud there because the speakers face down toward the bar area, not OUT toward the casino.  She said it was not as loud farther in the restaruant.  We asked to be seated at a table, as far back as we could get.  It was still extremely loud and not a fun, relaxing dinner since we had to talk to loud to be heard.  Santa Fe Station is a LOCALS casino, catering to an older crowd.  We are done with the loud music scene and when we are out for dinner, like to have a conversation without screaming.  Cabo may want to re-think this whole loud music concept....going to lose a lot of older customers, which on a Wednesday night are the majority of customers.    As for the rest of the experience....GT is great behind the bar, servers were excellent, food was good.....music is what will make us find a new location to spend our time and money."}
{"text":"We were there at the casino theater to take in a movie, so we ended up eating here.  There are many bad reviews of this place, but I had a good experience.  The food was good, and our waitress was very attentive.  Don't know if I'll return, since it's on the opposite end of town as I am, but had a positive experience and would come back again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars?  Apparently no one has been to Cabo. The food is good. The service is good. The prices are reasonable. Portions are generous.  The drinks aren't watered down.   A BIG PLUS is that you can get a great vegetarian meal. So hard to find!  We will be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Had an awful meal everything looks like it had been sitting out for hours. We didn't get what we ordered. Half the plate was wasted on all parties. There was no organization in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Recently went here with a friend while at Sunset Station and neither of us were impressed at all. The food was just OK, but not memorable. My friend would only eat about 25% of her chicken tostada because she said it just wasnt good. My Mexican shrimp cocktail was a bit sad and its presentation didnt really make much sense. We found that the service was friendly, but the food was a bit dire. Not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"I have found that the food is not very consistent here. By that I mean that some items are delicious and some are nearly inedible. Here's the breakdown:   Chips and salsa/ beans- quite good  table-side guacamole- delicious!  Shrimp tacos- icky disgusting with no flavor at all  Chile Verde- gross partially sweet stew with a minuscule amount of pork  tortilla soup- nice broth with smooth chunks of avocado, my usual dish  bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer- sometimes amazing, sometimes overcooked and sat under a lamp for too long.   Given the current choices at the Santa Fe, you might be better off hitting the food court."}
{"text":"I go to this place twice a month.  Yummy salsa bar, but on a couple of occasions the salsa was made incorrectly.  Fast and nice service!  The steak salad with the house vinaigrette is outstanding.  I also like the fajitas and combo meals.  The price is average for a sit down nice Mexican restaurant.  I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"we're from san diego so mexican places have tough competition for comparisons.  margaritas are great... i had the perfecto and the pomegranate.  not disappointed.  chips and salsa are good since they give you 3 different salsas and refried beans.  the entrees are just okay... the carnitas were not to especial.  and our waiter was not so attentive."}
{"text":"Margaritas too sweet - too much mix. Salsa fresco and tomatillo avocado salsa are good. Chicken suiza and chimi were good especially the green chile verde sauce!"}
{"text":"I. Would have given Cabot 4 stars, but the 1st time we went for the 48oz margaritas for $10.00 they were closed Last night we went for dinner. They still serve 48oz margaritas for $10.00 The food was very good, the service was friendly, knowledgable and fast. Overall a fun dinner experience. The prices were very reasonable and recommend going"}
{"text":"We wanted to use our 2 for 1 coupon at the buffet on a Monday night, but the line was pretty absurd for 6 PM. I guess everyone else wanted to use their coupon too. We jumped on two seats in the bar at Cabo with the dining area on a 15 minute wait. Our dinner had some hits and misses, but more misses.  The bonus sitting at the bar was the television to watch football, but the downside is we got first hand view of a cluttered mess. There were jiggers sitting out in the open not being soaked between use, dirty glassware sitting by clean glassware, and mixes sitting out in the open not organized or being refrigerated if needed. Because we were the only ones in the bar at the time, we received attentive service at first, but declined as it got busier. One man came to the bar waited for five minutes with no one appearing, then bolted.  The positives about the food were my wife's chicken fajitas and the complimentary chips and salsa bar. No bueno on my carne asada burrito, the sides of rice and beans, and the luke warm chicken tortilla soup. I probably should have ordered the burrito without sour cream because they put a huge, cold gob of it in the middle which cooled off the rest of the contents of the burrito, including the bland beef. Needless to say, I didn't finish my food, which happens about as often as Halley's  Comet.  I was pretty good at picking some winners for most of last year, but I failed on this first one of 2017. We could have done better with our $48. Next time we're in a bind, we'll leave the property or wait in line at our trusty stand by Oyster Bar."}
{"text":"Very decent place.  The food is freshly prepared/made to order.  Their menu is small but so are most places that have a similar feel to it.  The good and bad are that it is located in Sunset Station.  Bad because it is in the Casino good, because it is in the Casino.  I say this because some people will never enter a casino and those who do come here have a great alternative to some of the bigger restaurants to use their comp dollars and to find good inexpensive food."}
{"text":"The wait and bus staff are awesome, thank you Brian and Elsa. The food was very good, chips and salsa plus refried beans.  The tamales are above average size served on a corn husk for authenticity.  The flan, oh the flan, a must.   Prost"}
{"text":"Boo-Woo! It's Closed For Ever! I visited this Cabo in August 2017. Had a great dinner, good service, was planning on going back with family and found out it closed permanently Friday on Oct 6 2017 after many years of service! Good luck to them & thank you!"}
{"text":"I guess we're here for Mexican food and margaritas considering it's five of Mayo. Typical casino restaurant loud and obnoxious but we thins good I think I've been here once before with couple of friends but I can't remember."}
{"text":"6pm on a Friday, only five tables were occupied. Nasty hostess with painted-on eyebrows tells me they can't seat us because they only have three servers. Sooo apparently their servers can't serve two tables each? No wonder this place is always empty!!! They turn customers away from their 75% empty restaurant on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place when I visited the one at Red Rock. The bloom is off the rose now, though. The food is average pseudo-Mexican, and the cheese dip I was so enamored of the first time I tried it tastes less interesting now. I'm somewhat  underwhelmed now.  I think this is a great spot for a get-together or as a place to eat when your real goal is to hang out with someone, but I wouldn't come for the food in and of itself."}
{"text":"I liked this place! I came here during happy hour mid-week.  I found the decor to be interesting, which is important to me, as I like having things that catch my eye. That strange Disney-looking pile of TV screens hanging over the bar certainly was interesting, though I can't say its my type of decor, and it clashed with the reddish/orange theme of the space. (I have to add, aren't there more colors than red/orange for new restaurants? I'm starting to get tired of this color palette!)   Anyway, the interior was pleasant. I sat on the bench-style seating along the casino and it was sufficiently comfortable. I don't do tall bar-chairs, and they had those, too.  The place was not full at all, and our geeky waiter, who was a bit forgetful, was quite pleasant.  We tried every single happy hour appetizer offered (embarrassing) but that night was drown-my-sorrows night, so I deserved them.  The cheese dip was good. I LOVE cheese. I must have been a mouse in my previous life. This was real cheese, not that Velveeta-smooth stuff other restaurants sell as food. The guacamole was good but we had to add salt to bring out the flavor. The chips were heat-lamp warm rather than freshly-made warm, but no complaints- they did their job and tasted fine. I liked the chicken wings- crisp and moist and tasty!   I enjoyed the chicken mini-tacos and liked them even better with the accompanying pico de gallo. The quesadillas were boring- I'll skip those next time.  The chimi taquitos were all right- fried rolled flour tortillas stuffed with some kind of meat. I think I was full by the time I got to them or I'd probably be a little more enthusiastic. Or not. They were just all right.   I prefer \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine, but I will settle for tasty chain-restaurant-level Mexican when I need a fun fix.   I may not be raving over the food and the service could have been a little more attentive, but it is what it is. No major complaints to keep me from coming back.  If I were staying at Red Rock I'd hang out here for a bit."}
{"text":"I had a $25 food voucher and that's enough for 2.  The chips and salsa bar really give great value but getting carried away with a lot of it will guarantee boxed leftovers.  We ended up with a couple of boxes!  We ordered the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas.  The food was pretty average.  The cut of beef they used for the fajitas was kinda weird, almost overly tender and would've been better for beef stew.  Enchiladas were what would we expected them to be.  It's hard to mess those up.    Our server was very upbeat and friendly.  This place is more like 2.783346 stars and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last time there with so many other choices for Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Decent alternative to all those expensive ACYE buffets...  My friends and I tried their all you can eat tacos for only $7.99.  You get your choice of ground beef, shredded beef or shredded chicken.  On your first plate you get 3 tacos, side of rice and choice of either black beans or re-fried beans. There's also lettuce, tomato and cheese on the side so you can make your taco however you like. I ordered the shredded beef and it was surprisingly good and pretty juicy.    The meat is pilled on high so the three tacos are pretty filling. But if that's not enough for feel free to order more tacos since it is ALL YOU CAN EAT.  The tacos will come two at a time and the rice and beans are given upon request.   Chips are also served along with a bean dip and 2 different types of salsa.  The Cabo Mexican Restaurant is a solid deal!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Our server Bill was quick and pleasant. Food came out quick and was delicious. Get some table side guac with your chips, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Have you been drinking?? Has it been a lot?? Keep drinking if it hasn't! Chug, dammit! Are you tipsy as hell, yet? In the mood for Mexican food?? Then this is the place to go, because you must be drunk as fuuuuuuck or too tipsy to care to go here!  I REALLY wanted to like this restaurant. I really did. I am not really the complaining type and I tend to find something good in everything, but this place pissed me off last night and this was the last straw. I will NEVER go back!   This was our second time here. We came once before with a group of family and friends, about a month ago and everyone but me hated their food. I thought everyone was tripping because my steak fajitas were fantastic. Plus they had a special where you get a second order of fajitas free if you order the steak or chicken. So I felt like I really scored and was excited to go back and have them give it a shot, again.   Fast forward to last night, we made an earlier reservation for 9:30pm, since they closed at 10pm. We wanted more uninterrupted service, because it seems chaotic in there when it's busy. We arrived on time and were immediately seated, maybe 6 tables occupied in total. We sat there for at least a good 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. A guy came over and apologized for the wait and asked us what we would like to drink. We told him and I also asked if he could put in an appetizer order of the tableside guacamole. He said he'd let our server know. The drinks came and our server finally stopped by to say that she'd be right with us, that she was dealing with an issue at another table. No problem! We weren't in a hurry per se, but we were hungry.   I tend to be very patient and I treat people how I would like to be treated, but it was back to back problems tonight. First, the table next to us had a complaint and apparently our server didn't handle it well because we heard their grumbles and they called her back after getting their bill. When she finally arrived to take our order, she apologized and I asked (playfully), \"Can we get a discount?\" Clearly she didn't pick up on the humor, because she said, \"On what?\" Then she followed that with, \"You can order from the happy hour menu.\" No shit dummy! So I gave her an intense look and said we were just kidding, to which she relaxed, but I was already starting to feel a little tinge of irritation. She could tell that I was irritated by that and tried to play it off. Be happy we were smiling and still had a sense of humor after all that waiting!! She took our order and I told her that our guacamole still hadn't come. She looked perplexed and said, \"You ordered guacamole?\" I told her that we told the guy who took our drink order...well shit, she was nowhere to be found, so we gave our order to the first face of salvation! She said she'd check on it and walked away, catching the drink guy on the way, yelling over to him asking if we ordered guacamole. So unprofessional. Why not WALK up to him? Our food came out, then the guacamole. Our server was nowhere to be found in between then.   When the guy came with the guacamole, I told him nevermind since the food had just arrived. Even he gave me a sympathetic look and said that he understood. We were REALLY pissed about that because we were seriously looking forward to it. Our food was decent, not the best, but we were so upset and pissed about our experience thus far that we kind of picked over it. She came by once to check on us, asking about the fact that we didnt want the guacamole and I advised her that it was too late. Then we didn't really see her around anymore.  In between that time, another lady was seated behind us and she walked out soon after her arrival. A table in the middle of the room requested the managers and they complained about stale chips, cold food, and mediocre service. They handed their plates to management and walked out. If you're keeping count, that's 3 tables back to back. We were the 4th! Management stayed so focused on them that they didn't see our hand up, as in \"we're next!\"  To add insult to injury, she brought the bill before asking about dessert or how anything was. I asked for to-go containers and of course, we waited and waited. In fact, she came out of the back and stood there and stared at that couple in the middle of the room complaining to management. We just stared at her until she noticed us. Then the light came on as she stared at us for a second and she went for our containers. By the time she brought them, we were beyond DONE! We didn't even want it, anymore. We paid the bill and then I walked directly up to the manager. I filled him in on our experience, expletives tactfully included; poor thing profusely apologized. He advised us that their manager wasn't there, so he and the other lady were managers covering from the café.  He was nice enough to refund our bill and offer us food from the cafe. I thanked him, but told him we were cool on the food."}
{"text":"MMMMMM..I love this place!  The chips and salsa are yummy.  Especially the green salsa!  I recommend the fajitas.  Every now and then they go on special for $7.99 or so.   The only downside is that they open at 4pm.  They should open for lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---  Since my boyfriend and I play a little bit at Station Casino's, Sunset Station, we each received a $10 food and beverage credit in the mail. Being we had recently visited their cafe, we opted to try their Cabo Mexican Restaurant.   We made our reservations through Open Table, although we really didn't really need them. The restaurant had a nice crowd but due to the large size of the dining room, everyone was pretty well spread out and there were still ample seats left.  To start I ordered a margarita and we were brought bean dip, mild salsa and warm tortilla chips. Margarita, two thumbs up! It came in a huge glass and the tequila/mix melody was absolutely perfect. The tortilla chips tasted homemade and of the two dips, the bean dip was hands down was my favorite. Our server was kind enough to let us know about the salsa bar which we could help ourselves to if we needed any more chips or salsa. At the salsa bar there was about 10 more options for salsas! They have so many options, it's hard to choose! We were so happy not to get an appetizer because we filled up on all the chips and salsa!  For my meal I opted for the pick 2 combo of a tamale and tostadas. The tamale was decent as were the tostadas. The beans were the same that we had with the chips from earlier so I was a bit tired of them by the time dinner came around so I passed on those.   Overall for a Mexican restaurant, it wasn't bad!  If you're in the area and looking for a nice, clean Mexican cuisine, definitely check them out, it's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"My family is a big fan of this place. Normally a restraunt inside a casino is not for us. HOwever, this is an exception. The food and service always seems great. The salsa and chip bar is wonderful. They have refried beans on the bar and they are some of the best I have ever eaten. Not sure how they make them sooooo good.  This place is great. Will defiantely be back over and over again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their chicken and beef enchiladas.  I've tried several Mexican restaurants in Vegas and these guys have a really good recipe and it was served very quickly.  I  ordered Traditional Flan for desert and it was so yummy I almost ordered two! My server, Susan was fun and exceptional.   She kept my tea full and was devoted to my every need. The manager stopped by to say hello and I enjoyed chatting with Monica, the hostess, on the way to my table. Reasonable prices, great good, good company.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Four people at the bar and service seriously took forever. The bartender was too busy talking to slot players to pay attention to anyone else."}
{"text":"Camerones mojo de ajo. Delicious! The shrimp were sauteed in olive oil, garlic and chilies. The combination was yummy. I asked for a side of corn tortillas so I could make my own little fajitas. It comes along with a side salad and a tomato vinaigrette dressing that was really good since I had never heard of that dressing before. The side veggies that the shrimp came with were a bit too buttery for me. A must order is the homemade guac made for you fresh at the table. It's a large bowl so hopefully there are a few people with you to enjoy it, otherwise you'll find yourself eating the whole bowl to yourself. A washed down my meal with a raspberry margarita. It was a little on the sweet side for me but good anyway!"}
{"text":"The food was delish. Service was friendly and quick. I did order a coronarita and I felt it was watered down. I've had these before in the past but this one just seemed the lemon/lime taste of the margarita was lacking."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my birthday as I love the salsa bar. I am so sad to report such a bad meal. Starting with the draft beer that was totally flat. I sent it back and was brought yet another completely flat one. The guacamole and queso dip were good as were the warm chips and salsa bar. I ordered the fish tacos. For 15.99 I was brought three tiny tacos that were not sauced with salsa blanca as stated in the menu, but were drenched in bottled RANCH DRESSING!  Awful!  I should have sent it back but I had already sent the beer back and didn't want to be a downer on my bday.  So sad that this restaurant has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I wish this place was open for lunch, but it's not.....The best thing here (the only thing we order) is the table side guacamole. It's great! The rest if the food on the menu is basic \"safe\" watered down Mexican food....seems to make tourist, wonderbread middle America happy.   Order the guacamole! YUM!  :o)"}
{"text":"This place was totally unexpected. After moving to Vegas two weeks ago, I was in the mood for some Mexican food and my husband was in the mood for some Texas Hold'Em.   Anyhow, we were greeted and promptly seated despite it being 7pm on a Saturday night. A warm basket of chips with 3 salsas and refried beans for dipping and I was already a happy girl... but then when searching the drink menu for what type of margarita I wanted we saw a pink or blue cotton candy beverage, topped with cotton candy, that we had to try. We got the pink, and we were very pleased- delicious!  I asked the waitress for a entree recommendation and she said her favorite was the chicken suiza. OH MY GOD. I have never EVER had a dish so flavorful, chicken so moist and ultimately mind blowing. Mexican food is never this impressive! My husband ordered cheese enchiladas and was also pleased-- I would say though, that the portions were not as overwhelming-- it was enough but not as much as previous yelpers had mentioned.   For dessert we had the \"fried\" ice cream. Basically, vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes with chocolate and caramel sauces- perfect! All desserts are only $2.50 and petite, but the perfect ending to the meal.   Overall, an excellent meal and we will be back... as Red Rocks has quickly become our favorite casino. Also, if the weather is nice, the \"patio\" seating is well worth it. Gorgeous surroundings-- palm trees, water, etc. I would guess the ambience we had outside"}
{"text":"This place was awful the Asian hostess was rude and when I spoke to the manager Kim to explain my complaint she was a total idiot and said I don't know how I would handle this complaint never tell a customer that what a idiot.I will not be returning here ever again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waiter took order, brought food and never came back all the while the waiter for the table next to us came probably 4  times in the length of time it took for us to get our service.. terrible waiter"}
{"text":"Waited a little over an hour for a table for 5!!!!   Watched over 22 people get seated before us!!!  All because the stupid hostesses could not figure out that if you have a table for 4 open, wait for the next table to be open so you can push the tables together to accommodate!!!  No the ignorant asses just kept seating other people!!!  I have never been treated so poorly by an eating establishment!!!!  Bad, sloppy and poor customer service!!!  I voiced my distaste and asked the others in my party to go somewhere else. The 2 hostesses overheard me so I have a strong feeling that the wait was done out of spite!!!  They told us our table was empty but we would have to wait for it to be cleaned. Another 20 minute wait on top of the 45 minute wait we had already endured!!!  We had to wait 20 minutes because the bus boy was too busy flirting with a waitress and the other bus boy is just surly and lazy!!!  My sisters and I frequent this restaurant often but I won't be returning any time soon. And I will probably never go back on a Friday!!!  Hey Cabo, your food is good, but it isn't that good!!!!!"}
{"text":"A big, comfortable place which has a great decor. The food is great, good price and server fast. They even have a salsa bar so you don't have to wait to get more chips and salsa. Works well for a couple or 20."}
{"text":"OK Mex,but not just feels cheap.  Not open for lunch and the waitstaff would rather be doing something else.  Why cheap you say?  I went there a year ago and sat at the bar and noticed a very loud fan in the beverage cooler (like 70 or 80 db loud). Went back 2 months later.Still broke.  And 3 months later,nope,still broke.  Last time I was there,it was finally fixed,but this is a sit sown restaurant in a very large casino and you can't get that fixed for nearly a year?  Man ,talk about cheap!"}
{"text":"Love, love the salsa bar! Great variety and plenty of Hot options. The atmosphere is laid back and the menu is typical sit down Mexican restaurant style. I had the shrimp/crab enchiladas, which were pretty good and I could taste the shrimp more than crab. The entrees were good sized, and they are not skimpy with the beans. We had no issues with service, and though we didn't have any margs or other bar drinks, they do have Happy Hour. A good stop for decent Mexican if you are at Sunset Station."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada burrito, it was tough dry and flavorless burrito. Why can't the pictures on their menus be more realistic? Lol"}
{"text":"Every week I have an administrative staff meeting. My turn to pick the location and this one was my fault. Service was OK at first but our server soon lost interest in our table. The food was bland resembling microwave frozen food. No one was impressed. Still looking for a good Mexican place in the Vegas valley"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night just to hang out and kick off the weekend. We were seated at the bar because the restaurant was already closed (@ 9?!) and the bartenders were umm well not very attentive. Granted, we had drunk @$$holes sitting next to us, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to ignore me. When we FINALLY got to order (just chips and salsa, cuz the kitchen was closed!) we weren't sure if the order ever got put in by the bartender. When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god. The salsa was decent but the beans which they provide with the chips were AMAZING!! Highly recommend!! We got kicked out like half an hour later, which I was not capable to drive yet. I was disappointed by the hours of this place, considering it's IN A CASINO!"}
{"text":"All you can taco's  sounds good..except after the first two I never got the second order..so after paying for two drinks and playing $20 worth of video poker I ended up paying almost $12 per taco, which were nothing to write home about..of course I complained and security arrived to take a report...WTF? After much complaining and receipt presentation I managed to get a meal comped..which would be the only reason I would ever set foot back into this place."}
