{"text":"great deals for both delivery and pick up , got one of the pick up specials,  large pizza with 3 toppings and 15 wings 3 drinks and one dipping sauce for 20.99. Waiting time was decent for a Friday night . Everything tasted great!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza at an excellent price.  Delivery time was no different than other places (50 minutes on a Friday night).  They do not skimp on toppings at all, nor do they charge extra for chicken as a topping.  The wings were decent as well.  Very good quality for the price.

For $28 I got two medium 3-topping pizzas, 16 chicken wings, choice of 1lb of wedges or a box of Jos Louis, garlic bread, 2 dipping sauces and 6 cans of pop.

Delivery charge is only $1, all other places charge $3-5 for delivery.  Will definitely become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Pizza here is consistently good and well topped. The prices are competitive because there is a PIzza Pizza right next door and another pizza joint down the street. I haven't tried their donairs but i hear that's pretty good. Will def be back."}
{"text":"One of my fav pizza wing places in the area. For 30$ you can get a pound of wings, two medium three topping pizzas, 4 cokes, pound of Wedges and a garlic bread. 

Nostalgic pizza Alps. I miss the place. My favourite Saturday night UFC food."}
{"text":"The best wings available on Weston Road. Oven baked and bristling with sloppy savoy sauce. Try it with the blue cheese dip."}
{"text":"The pizza here was good but nothing spectacular. It was definitely way better than pizza pizza so I was pleasantly surprised. A great pizza place for dinner on the go and something good to grab on the way home. I will be back next time but there are other places where the pizza is a bit tastier."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm never in this area but now I have a reason to drive to Weston.  Their burger is crazy good.   I make it my mission to check out any Toronto burger spots.  Flavour reminds me of burger priest but patty size bigger.   Crazy good.  The owner was running a touch late so hooked up some fries.   Will be making this my go to place for burger cravings.  I have no doubt this spot is worth the gas and my tummy agrees."}
{"text":"Please be aware that when you order from this place your delivery is probably coming from Switzerland because it takes forever to get to your house if you like cold food this is the place to order it took an hour and 15 minutes to get a delivery that I can watch 5 minutes and get definitely won't be buying anything from these people anymore"}
{"text":"Massive shawarma here for about $4.75 taxes included.  I struggle eating this and I have quite the appetite.  The pizza is pretty decent but I only go here for the shawarma platter and pitas."}
