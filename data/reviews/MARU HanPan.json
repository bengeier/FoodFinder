{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience here at Maru hanpan. I liked that they had the sharing platters that are suitable for a group of 3 or 4 to share. Menu has lots of variety and choice to choose from.  Food: Ordered the large Assorted Hanpan dish which came with a little bit of everything. Most of the dishes came with 3 to 4 pieces of each which was perfect. In this platter, my favourite were the fried chicken, fried potato, tonkatsu chicken and rice ball. Chicken was still moist on inside but nice and crispy on the outside. The tonkatsu with cheese and yam inside was good and unique too. The rice ball was a great complement to the fried dishes. I wasn't a big fan of the salad that came with the platter, I thought that the sauce was too vinegary. However, the initial salad that came as an appetizer dish with the sesame dressing was really good. Beware, the noodles in the platter are very spicy.   Atmosphere: The vibe of the restaurant is very comfortable. Perfect for groups to come and catch up over good food. It encourages groups to eat and chat slowly, not rushed."}
{"text":"Got the T.O.S. Hanpan, and though we asked for it to be less spicy, it was still quite hot - so for anyone that's wondering, the chilli pepper on the menu means \"Korean level of spicy\".  So maybe avoid that one if you're not looking for that sort of experience.  Onto the sides: Tako wasabi is raw octopus mixed with wasabi (and it smells stronger than it tastes, in this case) and comes in a small ramekin dish.  Kaarage is alright, though preferred the creamy croquette that was housed in the same basket.  All in all, I'd say the meal was OK, and that the draw of the place is that the large hanpan comfortably feeds 4 adults - at $53, it's a pretty good deal.  Good to try once, but not sure there's really anything special about the food itself to want to come back too many times."}
{"text":"Maru Hanpan is new to me. The restaurant is nicely decorated and make me feel comfortable. Heard this restaurant is famous of its pan dishes. Follow the recommendation and ordered the assorted hanpan. The Assorted Hanpan dish has tonkatsu and hamburger steak, fried chicken, korokke, kimchi poutine, sausage, egg omelette, and spicy noodles with vegetable. It does have a variety of food and it was quite an experience.   I like the salad that comes with it. There's vinegar with some special flavour added to the salad that makes the salad tastes refreshing.  Korokke is another surprise to me. It is stuffed with purple yam, and cheese. It is quite filling. I tried potato korokke and chicken before but not yam and cheese. It's unique.  Spicy noodles with vegetable and riceballs are the perfect combination.  In the middle of the tray placed a shallow ceramic pot with barbecue hotdogs, deep fried pork chop, a slice of pineapple and a few pieces of hamburgers. The presentation is attractive but the candle underneath the ceramic pot is too thick for the candle to heat up. The pot is not hot at all but it creates the enthusiastic mood to dig in the dish. There are too many food, don't know what to eat first. This restaurant is pretty good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first time here at Maru.  Place is spacious and comfy.  Love the decor as well.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Got the T.O.S Hanpan large size $53, was very good and filling. Love the Takoyaki and chicken karrage. It was pretty spicy but it was so good.  At the end they also make fried rice for you.  Pretty cool concept.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was picked because couple of my friends want to do some filming in order to share our food experiences.  The restaurant was modernly designed with dark gray undertone with really loud music.  I had to talk much louder in order for my friends to hear me.    The menu was printed out and clipped onto a clipboard which I found really odd.  We decided to have large octopus dinner set since the server said the large one wouldn't be enough for three people.  We order a pork wonton soup in addition since we really craved for soup.  The set was really well done with a black sesamr coleslaw.  The salmon sushi salad was wonderfully seasoned.  In the set there was also seaweeds with raw octopus slice marinated in this wasabi sauce which was really well done.  The deep fried mash potato and chicken kaarage were just wonderfully seasoned, and I didn't even dip them in sauce.  They were GOOD?   The main dish with traditional spicy Korean red sauce was just average.  But there was a server who came to stir fried rice with the remaining sauce, I thought it was kind of neat.    There  was an awkward moment when one of the servers tried to talk to us and thought we are some really popular youtubers.  So he gave us a really weird milky liquidy desserts with fruits to us for free, and I did not like the dessert at all.  Since we just had one video on our account, we were kind of embarrassed.  But the look on his face was priceless since he gave us something for free.  lol? Then, we were ignored by all the servers for the remaining of the dinner.  Anyways, the meal was good with average service."}
{"text":"My first experience at Maru Hanpan was truly superb yet casual dining experience.  This T.O.S. Hanpan was super addictive.  It consist of few delightful seafood platters.  The beautiful centre platter has spicy stir fried Tako, Octopus  and Squid . They were so delicious.  The sauce wasn't too spicy at first, but the heat built up nicely, which made me little dripping sweat  However, you can express your spicy preference to the server when you place the order.  They will make it to suit your taste for spiciness.  The diced salmon in the hoe-chim (cold dish) was fresh.  It stimulated my taste bud along with the little salty tako wasabi (cold dish). I loved the cheese korokke.  The cheese inside became little stringy and gooey.  It was so delicious.  Seaweed wrapped rice balls  was adorable and delicious.  Overall, this hanpan really satisfied my craving for spicy food and completed my day.  Thanks Maru Hanpan for the excellent food experience.  I will definition come back to try other hanpans on the menu"}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant is a solid 5 stars. It is located where the Chinese dim sum used to be. As bad as it sounds, I am glad that the restaurant closed down and was replaced by this wonderful Korean restaurant.  In terms of ambiance, music and the flavour of the food. I've ordered the Tako HanPan small ($39.95) This Maru Hanpan consist of: Tako Nabe, Takoyaki, Tako wasabi, Hoe-Muchim, Fried Chicken, Korokke, Egg Omlette. The egg omelette was pretty good as a side.   Takoyaki was a good size and tasted good. The broth was nice, very flavourful and not too salty. Highlight, they have siu mai -my fav crab siu mai in the broth that I used to buy from J-town in the broth. The octopus were the large ones and they cut it for you to place in the pot, fish balls, and veggies. The only point to note was there were too much udon.   One suggestion will be options for other chap chae or other noodles options.   The fried chicken can use more spice. Right now, the flavour relies on the sauce that you dip in. The fried potatoe croquette was good on its own.   The salad has small pieces of salmon sashimi in it. Same owner as Kobi in the same plaza. No wonder the quality is pretty good!   Overall, I am quite satisfied with this restaurant in terms of food, drinks options, ambiance, music and service. I would say it's one of the best ones around this area! Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This location has seen several changes of hands in the past few years. It used to be a few Chinese restaurant and now it seems to be a Korean cuisine+ a few jap dishes.  It was a bit hard to figure out what their main Theme is. I guess I'd describe it as a family style share menu type of thing where they offer a smorgasbord of snack type of food. I could imagine eating these type of food with beer or as a nightcap.  It was quiet when we came. We were the only 1 of 2 tables. The service was prompt and they have those buzzers that you use to request service. However, the wait staff keep getting our drinks wrong, bringing us tea when we ask for water.  Not knowing what to order, we chose from the Hanpan menu as well as a sashimi teaser.  While the sashimi was fresh, I prob would not order them here again as its kind of overpriced and not really their selling point. The Hanpan itself is a variety of deep fried stuff like chicken, hamburger meat, kimichi poutine, etc. I really like the little rice balls  with seaweed but the rest is kind of blah. Overall not my type of dining but I can see its place for others."}
{"text":"Came here with 4 other friends and had an amazing meal. We ordered the large pork feet hanpan (which we accidentally ordered spicy) and the small TOS hanpan. While the large portion is good for 4 people and the small for 2, prepare to be completely stuffed after your meal.  The pictures really speak for the meal. Although the pork feet was a bit too spicy for us, they had other food with the hanpan that made it all worth it.  With the pork hanpan, they had omelette, fried chicken, cold noodles on the side, rice balls, radish, korokke (which was absolutely spendid) and chicken feet. The pork itself was so tender and the food on the side really complimented it. With the TOS hanpan, there were fried chicken, omelette, rice balls, korokke, takoyaki, a sort of salmon salad and tako wasabi. On the menu, it says that they have fried rice and when we asked them about it, the server told us that they fry it on the table with the leftover sauce from the main dish (which would have been really great, but we were already too full to eat anymore.) I usually prefer pork over seafood, but since we accidentally ordered the spicy pork feet, the TOS dish was comparably less spicy and thus I was able to enjoy it more.  Servicewise, it wasn't really great as they all seemed really busy and the restaurant was quite big, but we were eventually able to get our pitchers of ice water (several time throughout the night in fact.)  I'll certainly be returning for more just because I want to try more of their items on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"You ever have a feast that caters to each one of your senses? It's really a sight to behold, when the amount of food you order covers every inch of the table you're sitting at. That's why, as per tradition, phones got to eat first and bystanders had to hangrily wait before digging in. Oh well :)   On a Friday night, I gathered with a bunch of other Yelpers to tackle something truly extraordinary: Maru Hanpan's hot plates. Hanpan means hot plate, and this is where their specialty lies: large stone trays, each with an impressive assortment of main and side dishes.  I truly believe the Korean culinary experience was designed to make you full before you even get to your main course. Before our hot plates even came, there was a myriad of your usual side dishes. After the hot plates came, there were EVEN MORE side dishes: fried chicken and potato cheese balls, salmon sashimi salad, seaweed rice balls, wasabi octopus, Korean rice cakes, takoyaki...holy crap.   And yes, none of those things were the main focus of the hot plates! We got 4 small plates, and believe me, small is not even that small.   Pork Belly Hanpan: Contains a large grill of, you guessed it, sizzling pork belly. It was accompanied by lettuce, sauces, a large seafood pancake, and gyoza. If you're looking to indulge, this is the one.   Tako Hanpan: A boiling pot bubbling with octopus, beef slices, and all sorts of vegetable goodies. The broth was fantastic! Great for non-spice lovers and comes with fried chicken!!  T.O.S. Hanpan: Like the eye of Sauron, this bright fiery pot stood out among the relatively tame colours of the surrounding trays. As someone who lives on the mild side, I didn't eat too much of it. The one squid ring I had was tasty though. Comes with a refreshing sashimi salad.   Shabu Shabu Hanpan: It's hot pot on a hot plate. We were given bright red, fresh beef  slices and assorted veggies to throw into our pot. This one was the mildest of all of our plates, but a satisfying option still.   Damn, this was a long review. Just know that when you go to Maru Hanpan, you're in for a good, stomach stuffing time. Did I mention all of that food equated to $20 for each person?!! If that's just too affordable for you, indulge in a little Grape Soju. $17 for a bottle of expensive, sweet, alcoholic perfection.   (31/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"Assorted hanpan Comes in 2 sizes. The small feeds 2. The large feeds 3. Our waiter told us large feeds 3-4 people. If you do share the large amongst 4 people, like we did, you probably would not be full.  My favorites here are the chicken karage, hamburger patties, rice ball with seaweed. Egg omelette, tonkotsu, spicy noodles were also good, but didn't make my favorites list. The korroke was interesting. It was filled with purple yam and cheese. I got rid of the cheese.  Menu also says this dish comes with kimchi poutine but I didn't see it when our large pan came out. Where my kimchi poutine at???  TOS donburi This one is pretty spicy. Good, but spicy. Don't get this if you can't tolerate heat. Go for it if you can, and maybe ask for extra rice to tone it down.   Our party ordered a small assorted hanpan and looking at the difference between the large and small, there isn't a whole lot of difference. In the large, you get an 1 extra patty, sausage, and korroke. I don't think it's worth paying en extra $10 for it. I recommend you get a small hanpan, and if it's a large group, figure out how you want to share several small hanpans so you can try other ones too."}
{"text":"Got the LARGE Assorted fried hanpan. It was good and different from most Korean restaurants I've been to. I recommend trying it at least once. We finished the large hanpan for 2 people but they say it's for 4 but only ended up leaving some food behind. The popcorn chicken had large pieces of meat in it but didn't have enough spice I thought. The rest was good and the hanpan came quickly as well. The assorted fried hanpan felt pretty HEAVY as it was all fried foods and came with some cheese dips etc.   The place was clean and service was quick. And it was pretty quiet when we went on a Tuesday night.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon the plaza which is home to Maru Hanpan quickly transforms to a bustling epicentre of food culture. My friend and I decided something different, and came early enough to get a seat before it filled to capacity. Reading the reviews, I can report that the service was very good, quick and attentive. We were greeted promptly with a tasty kimchie beet and cabbage slaw with a slight peanut flavour. In addition, a complementary tea was also a great added touch.  We couldn't help but order the 'small' assorted Hanpan, which arrived fresh and kept warm with the tea light under the main pan. The assortment had a variety of calorie laden fried foods, and more traditional Korean fare as rice balls in seaweed. The sauces were relatively unremarkable, the red sauce tasting more along the lines of the sauce in a canned spaghetti can (how do I know this) but we're serviceable nonetheless.   Overall, a really fun and unique experience and something different. Good service, comfort food and something for all tastes. Some quick fixes would be to raise the lights a bit and to lower the hip hop a bit to set a more appropriate mood. The atmosphere needs a bit of tweeking. Perhaps hand out survey cards to get a temperature check from the customers, who seem to be from toddlers to seniors."}
{"text":"My friend noticed that a new Korean/Jap restaurant has set up in this plaza, so we decided to try it for her birthday. The ambiance was hip & trendy, and seemed like a great place to go drinking. For our group of 5 (+ a toddler), we ordered the large Tako Hanpan, cheese tonkatsu w/ rice, and beef udon.   The Tako Hanpan was definitely the star of the show. We were in awe when we saw the platter. The set came with tako nabe (hotpot), takoyaki, tako wasabi, hoe-muchim (spicy sashimi salad), fried chicken, korokke, california roll, and egg omelette. It was large enough to be shared with 4-5 people, and with the cheese tonkatsu, we were left stuffed with leftovers.   To start, the nabe (3.5) had skewers of fish balls, octopus, tofu, tofu puff, sliced pork, fish cake, fish siu mai, mushrooms, and radish brought together in a dashi broth. The pieces of octopus were absolutely tender, and the rest of the ingredients were cooked well. However, it is more 'healthy-tasting' as a whole b/c of the light broth & seasoning. This can be a good thing if you wish to balance out the heavier sides, such as the fried chicken and korokke. As for the add-ons (4.5), they were all very well executed. The fried chicken had a nice crunch to it but still remained juicy & tender on the inside. The korokke & takoyaki were also crispy with a savory mashed filling. The diced salmon in the hoe-muchim was fresh, and its spiciness, along with the tako wasabi, were stimulating to the palate. As for the sushi & egg omelette, they were quite standard but good nonetheless.   In terms of the cheese tonkatsu (3.5), it came w/ a bowl of rice, a potato, yam chips, and a side salad. I liked the salad as it was citrus-y so it balanced out the heaviness of the tonkatsu; the yam chips were tasty as well. However, the tonkatsu themselves were a bit too dry even with the cheese. The sauce complemented it well though and it wasn't greasy.   Overall, Maru has shown a lot of potential; I will definitely be back to try their pork feet hanpan. However, they need to hire more servers; there were only 3-4 of them on a Friday night so it was hard to flag them down."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place.  HanPan was good overall. The sides were a nice change, especially with the salads. Draft beer is great. The squid/octo dish was delicious but had almost no octopus. Was mostly squid rings. That was a little disappointing but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night. They weren't busy but there were customers steadily coming and going.   My boyfriend and I came to try the pork hock HanPan but they were out of stock.  We weren't disappointed for long, as the server suggested that the bossam HanPan ($34.95) was good for the two of us and boy he wasn't kidding  The presentation was nice and the lettuce was very fresh. The pork belly's fat was evenly distributed and it was very soft. They keep it on a steamer to keep it warm during your meal. It was a pretty generous portion and the seafood onion pancake was huge and tasty as well. We had half the pancake to take home because we were just stuffed.   The service was great too- friendly and refilled our lettuce and condiments and asked how everything was. I'm definitely going to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Ordered the TOS HanPan and loved it! We ordered the small and it was enough for 3 people. The main was squid/octopus stir fry and it came with a bunch of sidez: egg omelette, 4 maki, takowasabi, takoyaki, sashimi salad, fried chicken & croquette basket. Pricing was fair and their alcohol prices are pretty good for a bar. The ambience is dark and boozy. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This is an unique fusion Korean restaurant. They really lay out a feast and some flavour combinations I've never tried before. Their side dishes are uniquely refreshing and they serve the traditional Korean style chicken etc but also such creative spins of the usual tastes. Even though some dishes were a bit experimental and weird (like stuffing yam with meat) it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"So glad I came! I found it on yelp and had a major craving for Korean food. It's relatively new and has a casual young vibe inside. The menu has a mix of Korean and Japanese items such as karaage, Korean spicy noodles, sake and soju.  What I wanted to try the most was the han pan which is basically a tray of different Korean dishes with a hot plate in the middle.  We ordered the large pork feet Han Pan. They offer two sizes - small size (~$30ish) is for 2-3 people while the large (~$50) is for 4 people.  I was blown away by the size and how glorious it looked when it arrived at our table. It probably helped that I was very hungry at that point but oh man I was not prepared for that amount of food. It was an array of bar type of food with fried chicken, chicken feet (which I absolutely loveeee), fried potato mash, spicy cold noodles, steamed egg, four different dipping sauces, and of course slices of pork feet on a hot plate. They also had cold dishes of a sliced cabbage salad, rice balls wrapped in nori and slices of picked radish.  Fried chicken was quite tender inside and everything was spicy (not too spicy tho) which what I love about Korean food. The only thing that was missing would be lettuce leaves to wrap the pork in. The Han pan was definitely enough for four people. We also ordered a plate of cold noodles with snail which was alright.  Highly recommend everyone try the Han Pan which I found to be quite an unique experience, at least different from other Korean restaurants I've tried. And of course order some soju to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Firstly they missed my reservation. I made a reservation at 7:30 pm on Friday and when we came to the restaurant, they said couldn't find my reservation. Luckily the restaurant was not busy and we were seated shortly.  We ordered the octopus combo. Food was ok but the service was soooooo SLOW! We ordered the same time as the table next to us, if not earlier. We had nothing to eat when the other table almost finished their dinner! We had to ask 4 times to get everything on the table and no apologies!  I won't come and won't recommend to anyone! There are better Korean food options out there with much better services! (At lease won't keep you starving!)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food there and the atmosphere  server Roy took care of us really well.   Also variousnof foods in one plate bigg plate"}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 8.  The manager was nice enough to give us a private room.  The food came out quickly.  The service was accurate but can be improve.   I ordered a platter dish (small) that fit for 2 people and share.   It comes with sausage, hamburger steaks, fried chicken, pork chopsspicy noodle, egg omelette, and salad.  It is enough for 2 guys.  The gravy sauce that came with it is pretty good and the food is tasty.  Overall I would recommend this place and will come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good both in quality and.value. Service.was good as well. Will go back agsi."}
{"text":"First experience at Maru HanPan and needless to say it was an overall good experience.   I believe Maru is mainly known for its large sharing pan dishes. There are pans that can be shared amongst 4 people or more. That night I actually did not order one of those as I was not that hungry but would liked to try it out next time when I come again! I ordered their individual dishes instead. I had gotten their ' hamburger plate'. It cost around $15.95 which is a bit pricey but the amount of food they give you, justifies the cost.   The plate was alot.. 3 burger patties, salad, fried egg, a potato, grilled pineapple and a bowl of rice. It was such a large meal.. and tons of carbs and protein. The hamburger patties had some cheese on it too which made it more tasty. They weren't over sized patties like you'd get at burger places or like a BK or Mcdonalds. They were smaller sized but 3?!  This dish sort of reminded me of a Hawaiian loco moco sorta but korean version lol  Overall, the food here is pretty good from that one experience. But need to come here again to try what this place is all about. There large pan plates!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty and fresh! I got one piece of half raw octopus in the Tako red dish. I'm guessing it was hard to spot with all the red chilli paste. The rest of the food was fresh and restaurant is definitely clean. The menu is pretty small and simple. I will most likely still return though. Price was reasonable for four people at $120."}
{"text":"Came here in a large group on a Sunday evening and luckily they had a private room.  Staff: They were nice. I wouldn't say service is perfect, but for a large group, it wasn't bad. I got my dish pretty quick (I was late meeting my friends, so it was surprising that mine came so quickly). Meanwhile, others got their food very late. It was unfortunate, because we all basically ate at different times.  Ambience: The restaurant looked a lot bigger on the outside (at least to me). The private room was quite spacious actually, so that was quite nice that we were about to sit over 20 people together.  Food: I got the Tonkatsu meal and I was impressed by the portion of it. I originally was concerned it would be small, but this was a perfect portion and at a decent price ($15). My meal came with two pork cutlets, shredded cabbage (slaw), and rice. It was very tasty, though a tad salty. I appreciated the extra sauce they had on the side though.  It was one of the few times I felt good with what I had paid and was filled up quite nicely. A very satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"The food was cold and it literally felt like eating at mcdonalds and overpriced at $50 after tax for a set. Definitely not worth it. Reviews on Yelp were so misleading. And the service was basically non existent. Waited for so long to get our bill. No one comes to check or anything; our waiter disappeared and the rest of the waiters are always at the front cash desk."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food (I had the lunch special with bossam), and amazingly well priced for what you get. Tons of great sides and service is very friendly. Decor and atmosphere was nice. Will return for more~"}
{"text":"TLDR: 5 stars for the pork feet hanpan set, and 3.5 stars for the nabe hanpan set.   I came with 3 other friends for lunch. We were all super hungry, so we got two small hanpans. We were completely stuffed.  The pork feet hanpan is a must try. The sliced pork feet is cooked to perfection. Gooey skin with most of the fat rendered out so it doesn't taste too heavy. Comes with spicy sauce, garlic, and sliced jalapeno so that you can switch up every bite. The sides that came with it were a big egg omelette (we debated over how many eggs we thought was in there, I still think there's at least 3), cold glass noodle salad, sliced pickled radish,   karaage, croquette, and spicy chicken feet. My favourite out all the amazing sides was the chicken feet. I've always had a soft spot for chicken feet (lol), and this one is one of the best I've had. Only small complaint is that the karaage is on the beadier side.  The nabe was actually the worst part of the nabe set. The broth did not have much of a flavor and was a little bit underwhelming. The nabe had octopus, soft tofu, fried tofu, fish balls, sliced meat, mushrooms, dumplings and some veggies. The octopus got better the longer it stays in the pot, but overall, everything was a bit bland. All the sides were very delicious: imitation crab rolls, takoyaki, tako wasabi, salmon salad, and the same karaage, croquette, and omelette.   Parking in this plaza gets really crazy. The restaurant has large tables, very suitable for larger groups. The servers are a little slow, and it's a little hard to flag them down in the booths since the back is really high. Also, even though the restaurant wasn't too busy when we sat down, the food took a while to come, and we got our starters after the main hanpan was served. I would not get the nabe again but I would come back for the pork feet and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Arrived to the nicely decorated and dimly lit restaurant restaurant at 7pm and the place wasn't too busy but, slowly more people trickled in for dinner. The server brought hot tea and four complimentary side dishes - lotus root, pickled carrots, spicy turnip, and chopped salad in black sesame dressing. The black sesame dressing was interesting and tasted nice.  We ordered a sharing platter - Assorted Hanpan large size ($49.95)  I enjoyed the hamburger steak which was cooked to well done and charred nicely on the outside. The fried chicken dipped in the sweet bbq sauce was good. Egg omelette was soft and fluffy, tasted well seasoned.  They need to add more grilled pineapple! One slice wasn't enough. Purple potato korokke had a nice crisp crust which opens up to the potato and cheesy filling inside.  A bit off track, I really like the rice ball wrapped with shredded pieces of nori seaweed. I might try to make the rice ball at home! It seems like a convenient and easy snack to make for work, road trip etc...   Deducting the one star because the platter of food was not hot enough when it arrived to the serving table. The tea light doesn't really provide much heat to the ceramic dish above. The large size would be enough for 3-4 people (more to four people, dependent on appetite). Overall the portions were decent and satisfying. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for some sake and bar food. This place features HanPan, a format that consists of platters that are a smorgasbord of delights! We ordered the Pork feet and T.O.S. variants in small. Every bit of it was high quality and delicious and paired great with the hot house sake we had.  I recommend the T.O.S. which features the spicy stir fried octopus/squid/cuttlefish as the centrepiece (and this is a rare recommendation on my part as someone who typically does not go for spicy food). Small size will feed two people and I imagine the large could feed four.  The service was friendly despite lacking in organization and a little slow. I would definitely recommend this place to any groups looking to drink and have a wide variety of delicious food to go with."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner and the place was pretty empty. We both ordered the T.O.S., and the lady taking our order tried very hard with her limited english to communicate to us how spicy it was. I wasn't sure if customers just generally complain about the spiciness, or we just looked like we could not take the spiciness, but she tried very hard to make us decrease the spiciness level, which we eventually did not. I think I can handle hot food pretty well.  Food came fairly quickly, and the portion was generous - I could barely finish my food. Decent amount of rice, LOTS of sauce and seafood, and yummy seaweed to compliment the dish. I can see how some can die from the spiciness, but since I eat literally everything with hot sauce, I was able to handle it. I find the food to be quite good, definitely nothing that will blow your mind, but I would want to come again if I'm ever here. On the other hand, the side dishes were meh.  Love how they have an alarm to press for a waiter/waitress to come. It was convenient when it came to refilling our tea and getting the bill."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it would be great as reviewed through yelp, but realized that the service was really bad.   We did not get the full amount of side dishes until I decided to speak Korean to the waiters. They first gave us 3 then after speaking Korean we received 3 more side dishes.  The food was mediocre considering the price range."}
{"text":"Most try: Pork Feet Hanpan  I had a very enjoyable experience eating at this new Korean restaurant. The meal sets come with a main, we got the pork feet which were nice slices of tender meat with flavorful skin. It goes well with the spicy sauce, which you can either get on the pork or on the side.   For me, the sides really stole the show as well. My favorite being the spicy chicken feet (right amount of chew and perfectly marinated), the shrimp korokke (creamy and soft with a crunch on the outside) and the fried chicken. I could eat the sides alone! It was a good and somewhat innovative idea since normally the sides are just little munchies  but these sides are essentially real appetizers.  Considering a small set can comfortable feed 3, the price is very reasonable. I would definitely come again for dinner and experience everything again with their big drink menu as well."}
{"text":"The servers here were very attentive to all our needs and concerns. Because of the service, I was able to enjoy a very nice dinner.   I ordered the TOS Hanpan along which consisted of the main dish: spicy stir fried tako. This was accompanied by takoyaki balls, tako wasabi, hoe-muchim (I believe was the salad), fried chicken, egg omelette, rice balls, and korokke (fried potato balls). On top of this, we were served with 3 side dishes that included sweet lotus, pickled carrots, and a salad. Yes. I ordered the large. We were a party of 2, and no, we did not finish everything.  For the food, I loved the korokke most. It was very creamy and flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the tako wasabi since it was really salty and slimy for me. The spicy tako was sweet and spicy, however after a few bites in, you do get pretty tired of it. It helped to eat the different side dishes. I was a huge fan of the rice balls covered in seaweed. Very refreshing in a way.   After we nearly finished, we asked for the fried rice to be prepared. (They told us that we would eat this last) They made it using the leftover sauce in the pan, and topped it all with seaweed. We ended up packing most of our food to take home. It was a very heavy meal."}
{"text":"Three friends and I decided to come try this place after seeing their unique concept of their \"HanPan\".  We decided to order the mixed one which has a little bit of everything. When the food came we expected the waiters to light the candles, thinking that it will help keep the tray warm. But the candles kept distinguishing until the waiter finally said that they were actually just for decoration and had no other function.  Foodwise, everything was really average and nothing really impressed us. The food was not very hot and the dishes on the pan were very mediocre. The steak and fries were things that could be made at home, so nothing was really special. The little omelet was cold when it arrived and was just a plain  egg with ketchup on top. The kaarage was probably the best thing because it was crunchy and juicy! Everything else, including the noodles, were really just nothing special and definitely not worth the price.  We all left unsatisfied and not full even though we order the big pan. We were quite disappointed as we were expecting to have a great feast. 2 stars for the food but I gave an extra star for the interesting concept as well as restaurant service and ambience. Overall, everything was nice for photos, but taste wise everything was really just mediocre."}
{"text":"If you get the pork feet hanpan (which means one plate), ask for sauce to be on the side that way you can enjoy pork fee with and without the sweet spicy sauce which is excellent. I love the tako nabe here, I usually order it separately instead if choosing it as one of hanpan. Meat (whether pork feet or Hamburg) and tako nabe combination just goes really well together I find. They recently came up with something called Soju Mojito sweet and can't taste the alcohol in it, also comes with flashing light inside it. If the light bothers you, find the flashing ice cube and push the button on the bottom to change the light to just on or complete off. You can push through the bag, don't have to dig through the drink and get messy. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This plaza is getting some seriously crave-worthy Korean bar food. First the jjimdak next door, and now HanPan (not to mention cheesy KBBQ and taiyaki ice cream). Maru serves an impressive variety of Japanese and Korean bar food favourites, as well as a well-rounded selection for beer, soju, and sake. Service here appears disorganized/hectic and slow, with my party of four not being acknowledged by any semblance of a front of house/hostess for maybe 20 min (but then again, it was a Friday night and we were seated quite quickly thereafter). The restaurant itself is spacious, relaxed, and trendy.  The starting complimentary appetizers were great, featuring a salad with creamy black sesame/mayo dressing, tender lotus roots, and sweet pickles. The hot house sake arrived in a teapot and was quite smooth and easy to drink. My friends had previously eaten before coming but weren't prepared for what came next.  Let me say that I would not come here for any specific ONE dish. You should come to Maru for their HanPans, which are large sampler three tiered platters, with a cross-sectional tour of various delicious items on their menu flanking a butane stove heated centrepiece. We got the T.O.S (tako, octopus, squid) and Pork Feet HanPans, both in small (as recommended...no... as cautioned by our server).  The Pork Feet HanPan in the one side had onigiri, a simple omelette dressed in ketchup, and two mounds of spicy japchae. The other side had spicy chicken feet, karaage, korokke (Japanese croquette), pickled daikon slices, and four dipping sauces. The main piece was the pork feet with garlic, jalapeno, and spicy sauce on the side.  The T.O.S HanPan on one side had the omelette again, takoyaki, imitation crab salad sushi, and wasabi tako. The other side had another helping of the korokke and karaage, and hoe-muchim (greens and sashimi diced and dressed with gochujang; hoedapbap without rice). The main piece was a pan of spicy stir fry with octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, with veggies.  The sight alone of these two platters was jaw-dropping and drool-inducing to say the least. We greatly enjoyed our time just unwinding, chatting, while pouring sake down our gullets and stuffing our faces with all these different dishes. Not a single element was lacking in flavour or quality. At ~$40 per small HanPan, this meal won't run you more than thirty bucks. Quite the bang for your buck for some real crowd-pleasers.  I hope to return to explore the lunch specials, the other varieties of hanpan, and perhaps promotional/limited time dishes. With improvement in the organization of service, Maru has great potential. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for dinner with a small group of friends. The venue is fairly large with tons is seating. We ordered a large pork feet hanpan and it was just enough for the 4 of us. They also serve a large variety of korean alcoholic beverages of that's what you're into. The quality of the food was superb! Beware though, if you're not good with spicy food, avoid anything that is red since a lot of the dishes rely on red pepper paste for flavoring. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves some good quality korean food."}
{"text":"We drove by Maru HanPan and realized it was new and decided to give it a try. it's located in the same plaza at Kobi and Iryewon, so there are a lot of parking spaces available. Their restaurant is uniquely decorated and the lights are pretty dim, so it's definitely more of a late night bar food restaurant.  We ordered the first HanPan on the menu in a large, and it was enough to feed 4 adults (~$50). It came with a ton of food: sausages, hamburg steaks, fried chicken, kimchi fries, egg omelette, rice balls, noodles... A lot of it was deep fried. It reminds me of a korean XL version of a St.Louis appetizer platter. It's definitely the type of food that would go down best with a beer or drinks, or a great place to come if you've been drinking already and want some food to help sober up. I really appreciate the variety that comes with the hanpan, so you can have a little bit of everything and it definitely looks amazing on the table.  I'd definitely come again to try a different hanpan and grab some beers."}
{"text":"We came here after recommendation from our friend. The restaurant is located in a busy plaza but finding free parking was not hard, there were plenty spots available. Overall the food was good. We ordered the seafood Han Pan, it was a good portion for 4 ppl if you order the large. Everything tasted very good sufficient portions, and the food came pretty fast. The tako wasabi was extremely hot, it would be nice if served with seaweed to wrap it like izakayas. Our reasoning for 3 star rating was the service. We had to keep asking the server to come around because things were missing. He also didn't explain to us that the fried rice comes at the end of the meal and the shrimp tempura for the udon doesn't come when its served. It took us 10 mins just to find the server to get the bill. We would recommend this place for the food but only if you have all night to wait for the service."}
{"text":"Average food, terrible service. Will not be back. It took us 10 minutes standing at the entrance to be seated. Waiters will walk by you even when you flag them down and when they do notice you, they nod but take decades before they serve you. We were seated after a long time, only to wait a million years before I got fed up with being ignored by waiters and went up to them because we wanted to order food. Waiter didn't even look apologetic when I did and took another 10 minutes to come get our orders after. While taking our order, he knocked over the entire container of soy sauce which lead to it spilling all over the table. I don't even know why he felt the need to move it in the first place. He didn't apologize for his mistake and he didn't even tell us to move to another table. Instead, he just left without a word to get a table cloth. We had to ask him ourselves if we could move to the table beside us. Keep in mind there were plenty of empty seats in the restaurant. It was not busy.   Again, no apology, he just let us move.   We ordered a large portion of the tako HanPan. They must've left the pot on the stove and the food must have been precooked because a lot of the squid and veggies were burnt and the taste was either lukewarm or cold. You could taste the burned parts and the smell was overbearing. Over all not impressed with this place.   Bill took forever to come. Again I had to go up to them to pay because no one would come and take it. And of course again no apology. The woman who took my change looked at me coldly and absentmindedly.   For something that was so mediocre and maybe even below mediocrity, the set alone came up to $66 after tax and tips. First time, last time."}
{"text":"It's a 3 for me. Everything was over-cooked. We ordered a small sharing platter and a main dish for 3 people. The hamburger steak was supposed to be juicy but it was really dry even with the sauce. I believed we ordered the fried pork w/cheese. It was really dry and over-cooked. We didn't finish it. The only good food is the spicy cold noodle."}
{"text":"Food was good and it's shareable for two. Friendly staff. Great location with lots of parking space. The food serving was so big that you need a panoramic view"}
