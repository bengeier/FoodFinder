{"text":"Quite a good place to have a Korean food here. it's worth to try it. the service is good too. I like the big dumpling and noodle soup. I will try others next time. parking is easy. it will be on my lunch list with friends. give a five star, and expect the next time"}
{"text":"Very limited menu, with mediocre food.  The noodles are great, but the hot pot and bibimbap left much to be desired.  There are plenty of better Korean options in the area, and I would not go back to this one."}
{"text":"Tried out this place for the first time to see how it compared to the other mandu place that my fellow Yelpers were referring to. We kept it simple and ordered a mandu guk (dumpling in broth) with some ddukbokyi (rice cake with fishcake in spicy sauce).  I like this restaurant's take on mandu; it's a different spin from the other mandu place. Just as delicious! My only suggestion would be to offer an appetizer-sized ddukbokyi instead. At $12.99 for a full serving we found it a bit too filling, but would love to enjoy a smaller portion along with other dishes the next time we visit!  Would definitely come back again and try out the other offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"Cold bean noodle soup had gone bad, and the waitress told me to order another dish without saying sorry. Kalguksu and kimchi has too much artificial seasoning. I'm not going to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've had huge dumplings in Korea before and the huge dumplings here taste just as good if not better! There's a hint of ginger in the meat which makes it very refreshing.  The soybean cold noodles are very overpriced. There's noodles, unsweetened soybean milk as the soup, and some cucumber. Nothing else. It is also very tasteless. I don't recommend trying this.   The bibimbap is just average. It pretty much tastes the same as every other Korean restaurant.  The handmade noodles are also pretty overpriced for its portion and ingredients. There's barely any meat in it. The only thing positive is that the noodle texture is pretty good.  I would come back for the dumplings, but probably not the other dishes."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a hot bowl of Korean style noodles and giant dumplings. The food tasted similar to that I got in Myungdong Kalguksu. The location is definitely better as it is TTC accessible. I liked the broth of the kalguksu and also the kimchi tasted great. I would not mind coming back."}
{"text":"Giant dumplings sounded like a dream, but turned out to be a little less amazing.  The dumpling skin was nicely thin and delicate, but the minced meat filling was bland.  Ditto the seasonal Noodles with Soy Milk, surrounded by a few floating ice cubes to keep the dish cold.  Were it not for the generous free pot of kimchi and the plastic soy sauce bottle at the table, I probably wouldn't have tasted anything.  On the plus side, the service was nice, and the restaurant was clean.  There was no wait time for a table of two on Saturday night around 8pm."}
{"text":"Similar to one of the restaurants on Bayview that also is famous for serving big dumplings, I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this place. After going on a Thursday night, it was more full than we thought it would be coming from a restaurant that just opened recently. The restaurant is located at the plaza at Laureleaf and Steels w/ the Esso, Shoppers, LCBO, Second Cup, etc. It is on the left of the Nail salon that is there.   Although they have a small menu, the food was actually quite delicious and decently priced. With four of us, we ordered four different dishes. We ordered the mandu - big dumplings ($10.99); kalguksu - noodles ($9.99); dolsot bibimbap - stone pot rice ($11.99); meat pancake ($11.99?). Can't remember the name and exact price of the meat pancake.  All their food was actually fairly good, and for the record, I would definitely go back to this joint. Within the Bayview/Steeles area, there aren't a large number of Korean restaurants unless you head to the Yonge/Finch side. So this is definitely a win for me, and I'll be frequenting it often!   Their mandu was solid, filled with meat and delicious, they were large and came in 6 pieces per order. The noodles were regular, good broth, filling, they were chewy and enough for two people to share if there are other foods to share! The bibimbap was a win for me - they used purple rice for the stone pot, they gave gochujang and sesame oil and if you left the rice long enough, it actually formed a good rice crust at the bottom - which doesn't happen for many of the bibimbap dishes! And the meat pancake was quite good, a nice change from the seafood pancakes that are usually offered at restaurants (even though there is a seafood pancake offered for $17.99 I believe).   All in all, I WILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Ambient is good.  Service is good.  Food is average.  I came here because of the big dumplings, it is good for photo but it only tastes average.  Overall, this restaurant is ok."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, the best part of the meal was going to pizza pizza after, i tried the bimbimbap, and while it was ok, the portion size was so small, as if i hadn't eaten anything.  unfortunately the menu is very limited, so there aren't a lot of choices, other than traditional korean dishes they only serve one side dish which is kimchi. the service was quick but a bit abrupt.  the dumplings were good but really salty.  i cannot recommend this restaurant and would not go back."}
{"text":"My first time here yesterday and we ordered the kalguksoo and bossam. I really wanted to try their dumplings but I guess that will have to wait until next time. Their kalguksoo was really flavourful because of their broth which is a beef bone based broth. And their bossam is also pretty good too so I do recommend giving that a try!"}
{"text":"One of the cleanest Korean restaurants I've ever been to! The interior is quite modern and washrooms are very clean.  They only have one side dish - kimchi but it's the best kimchi I've had so far. It's very flavourful, not too sweet or sour, I really enjoy it.  I have tried the large dumplings, tofu/meat pancake and handmade noodles and they were all quite good!   Their menu is smaller than others but food is good quality. :)"}
{"text":"The Wang ManDu-large pork dumplings were what caught my attention to this restaurant. They close at 10:00pm, I called at 9:15pm and they said I can still come.  Stepping into this restaurant reminds me of how lucky I am to be able to eat authentic Korean food in Toronto. It feels like being back in Seoul!  The kimchi was nicely marinated. One of the best that I've ever had.  The meat pancake was good and flavourful. One thing I do recommend is instead of two big ones, they should make it to four smaller size.   Service was very friendly, even when the waitress was on her way out. I asked to pack the rest, she came back and got me a container and sauce.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So after reading reviews about this restaurant. I finally gotten the chance to try this out. Finding parking isn't too hard as this restaurant is located in the same lot as a Shoppers Drug Mart. After I walked into the restaurant, I noticed they are very clean. First thing after I sat down (after ditching off my jacket) was to flip through the menu. Their list of offerings aren't that many. Which I like, cause that means they are good at what's listed in the menu and not over diversify with other dishes.   Onto the food, after seeing so many pictures of the giant steam dumplings. I must give this a try. Then I ordered a Bulgogi and the last dish with fish cake and sticky rice cake (in red sauce), I forgot the name. The bulgogi came first and that was piping hot and tasty. The beef wasn't chewy at all. And the overall taste is subtle and not overpowering with garlic. Then the fish cake and rice cake dish in red sauce came. This dish was actually spicy, as the spiciness builds up slowly. This was the only dish I didn't like. But the last thing, which was the giant steam dumpling came out. This wasn't too bad. So overall taste was good.   Service wise, they are all on the ball and looked after us nicely. One thing, the homemade kimchi is WOW!!! :D"}
{"text":"The old Kenkou sushi place now transformed into a korean restaurant. Coming here on a weeknight during dinner hours you can find yourself waiting for a table.  Thankfully parking is not a hassle in this plaza, coming in, the place is open, clean with hints of pan-Asian decor.  The service at \"M\" was excellent, our servers were attentive and provided us some recommendations as we were not sure what to order.  When it was all finalized we ordered their *Kalguksoo - Beef noodle soup in a lovely broth that screamed COMFORT food.   *Bulgogi - Bi Bim Bap with beef, served in a cast-iron bowl with decorative and presentable flavors this dish was a delight.   *Wang Mandu - in house, home-made giant puck-size pork dumplings!  Overall this place is now one of my few go-to places for great Korean food. The service, ambiance, price, quality and overall ambiance is worth another visit."}
{"text":"The pork vegetable wraps and the dumplings are a must try. The pork is so tender and the massive dumplings are so good. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here because of the giant dumplings which I was not disappointed and it was well worth the value. The chives pancake was really nice as well, loaded with fresh chives. The spicy chicken on the other hand wasn't good, you could tell the meat wasn't thawed properly or thoroughly, the side dishes only comes with certain meals which is kind of odd. Another strange thing was when we were packing the leftover food, the waitress immediately and took the kimchi back (they serve kimchi in a big clay pot as opposed to a tiny plate like most restaurants), which makes me wonder if they would serve the remaining to the next table....."}
{"text":"For the past year, I've worked with several Korean colleagues (more than any other place I've worked at) in an area close to a large Korean population. Prior to this, most of my exposure to Korean cuisine has been at AYCE BBQ places and Pork Bone Soup (Gamjatang), one of my favourites. I've enjoyed it all, but in the past year, I've discovered a much wider range of dishes. I'm loving it.  I've heard mandu mentioned several times and there have been discussions about where serves the best one. Okay, what is mandu? Oh, it's a Korean steamed dumpling! I'm in.  This place came up in several discussions because of the size and taste of their mandu so here we are. Of course, we had to order the mandu. We also ordered Jaeyuk Bokeum, a spicy stir-fried pork dish, and Tofu Wanja Jeon, a Korean style pancake with tofu and minced meat.  The mandu, stuffed with pork and vegetables, was delicious. Our server recommended dipping it in soya sauce and that enhanced the flavour. As advertised, the stir-fried pork dish was spicy and tasted very good. Maybe there was a fermented component in there? Nice. The pancake dish reminded me of a sausage patty. The flavour was milder than the other dishes but also very good. The meal came with a sizable serving of spicy kimchi and that was delicious.  I'll have to come back to try some of their other dishes. I would recommend coming here but don't ask me to pronounce their name."}
{"text":"So coming here was an experience to try something different. I had the Sirloin Beef which in my opinion was pretty good. Everything else was lacking. Don't come here if you expect even halfway decent customer service. I had to keep waving down the waitress and she never came around to ask if I needed anything for my party of 6. I usually don't care but with others, there may be needs. We had to constantly wave down and ask for drinks, sauce, forks, napkins & the check.   My point of I don't sound ungrateful just yet, unless you're physically dying, don't expect to see your server for the whole night.   Now for the food. The food was okay. For the price that I paid, I expected better. I tried two different entrees, which were somewhat pricey ($32 for two small dishes) and definitely expected better."}
{"text":"Recently I visited this newly opened restaurant. I went under the impression that it was same restaurant as Myungdong Kalkuksu Noodle and Shabu Shabu at Bayview and 407, however, they are not related. Very similar offerings with the giant dumplings, shabu shabu, and  kalguksu noodles. But their menu is bigger, including bimbimbap, pancakes, and bossam. The restautant is spacious and clean and the service was very friendly. I prefer the dumplings and kimchi at the other Myundong but overall this place was good and we would return."}
{"text":"I've had the real kalkoosu in myeongdong this doesn't do it...  however it wasn't bad tasting. The north had a very strong flavour. I didn't try the dumplings maybe I'll give it a try next time. The portion size was good. They only have one side dish, kimchi but it's fine. Restaurant is pretty big in size, servers were attentive.   Over all it was alright but wouldn't crave for it."}
{"text":"Ordered noodle soup and dumpling and bossam( steam pork). The amount of the food was little bit too much to finish but better than too small. Bossam been cooked so well and melting in the mouth. With good day soju!!!! Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since they opened, and I think I'll be visiting them often. Their bossam is really good. With great texture and taste. The kimchi that comes with bossam is a little sweet but it compliments bossam. Their soup base for kalguksu(noodle) and manduguk(dumpling soup) is very thick and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was...less than average. We were attracted to this restaurant because of their fist sized dumplings. The pictures online really do, do it's justice. They were delicious and more than enough for 2 people. Aside from the dumplings, everything else we ordered was also very good. I would say that I took off half a star for the kimchi. The kimchi was drenched in spicy sauce. It was too much. I took off another half a star because the waitresses were not helpful. They were rushing us out of the restaurant. It was not packed (2 tables for a Saturday night) and was not closing until an hour later. Very confusing."}
{"text":"The dumplings were huge and very tasty when eaten with the sauce that came with it. I especially enjoyed the dumplings skin, perfectly chewy. The fillings not so much, as I personally enjoy a smaller dumpling where the skin to filling  ratio is higher. We went on a cold evening and their noodle soup hit the spot. The beef broth for the noodle soup was very flavorful. Only awkward thing was the server gave us our bill before we were done with our food so it felt like we were being rushed. The restaurant wasn't even packed so I didn't understand why this happened. Overall the food was still good and worth a try!"}
{"text":"Clean with good food. Great place for lunch. As someone said below: great place in a random plaza!"}
{"text":"Amazing find in a random plaza! They offer dishes that I've never had in other restaurants. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try something other than pork bone soup at a Korean restaurant, come here! Some dishes we got:  - shabu shabu: my favourite dish here. The soup is so refreshing and it tastes incredibly healthy. They also give you a bunchhhhh of vegetables (kale!!) and sirloin beef.  - pork wraps: the presentation is like eye candy, makes you even more hungry. - dumplings: these dumplings are HUGE and filling. Great for sharing  - bibimbap: taste like other places but here it's with purple rice  Kimchi is served in a stone bowl as an appetizer and it's one of the best kimchi I've tested. Service is amazing and the restaurant's extremely clean. Will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"I came here with my GF intent upon feasting on those plump giant mandu my friend spoke of just the day before. Walking in, the place felt like a modern cafeteria or a midscale food court, with the staff eating in the far corner and much of the restaurant quite empty. Part of the impression, I guess, stems from the fact that one of the tables we were seated close to had not been cleared out. This struck me as odd, as every other Korean restaurant I've been to, servers are lightning quick in clearing out and cleaning the table to be ready for the next customer. But hey, it wasn't busy and when it's break time, it's break time.  When we sat down I immediately sensed something with the furniture was off. The table was just at my navel's level. I'm an average/short guy and have average to terrible posture. Korean table manners (correct me if I'm wrong or if this is something more relaxed in N. America) dictate that serve/flatware are to remain on the table, never to be lifted at any point. These two points taken together: anyone 5'7 or taller would have to be awkwardly hunchback for the duration of their meal. Most decidedly not the best ergonomics.  We ordered the dolsot bibimbap (love me some of that yolk and gochujang-kissed bibimbap socarrat), spicy pork, kalguksoo, and of course, the giant mandu. The bibimbap and pork were acceptable, nothing particularly remarkable. The handmade noodles were delicious, especially the broth---perfect for today's weather. The mandu tasted good. However, I felt the texture of the actual filling a little off-putting. I'm not sure how much integrity I'm to expect, but the meat/vegetable interior crumbled clumsily apart when biting into it (maybe this is normal and I'm unable to appreciate real mandu?). It was otherwise juicy and savoury, and further enhanced with soy sauce.  Overall, not a bad experience. Marginally above average in many aspects, at par in others."}
{"text":"Excellent kalguksoo! First time I've tried beef broth kalguksoo (always had chicken) and it was delicious. Very flavorful broth and great texture in the noodles.  But the standout is their kimchi. If you like authentic kimchi that is unapologetic about its rich, garlic flavor, this is the place.  Service is also very polite. The seating feels a bit too sparse and open, but that's a minor point.  Great authentic Korean kalguksoo with solid kimchi is the main takeaway!"}
{"text":"Ordered tofu pancakes, chives pancake, shabu shabu, bossam and mandu dumplings. All delicious. They help cook the shabu shabu for you so you dont need to. The kimchee at this place is amazing -- they give you alot and it seems homemade. tofu pancakes also have ground pork and it is delicious."}
{"text":"This place literally deserves more good reviews. We went there today, ordered wang mandu and bossam. We didn't have much expectations from it cause usually the Korean dishes are all about the same at most places. The meat from bossam were really juicy, it just goes so well with the radish and lettuce that came with it. Mandu were big and juicy. Everything just worth for the price at this place. Highly recommended to try this place."}
