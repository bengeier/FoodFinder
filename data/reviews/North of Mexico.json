{"text":"Was out on a Friday night with the wife and we drove past this place and it was packed so we decided to go in. It was really crowded so we decided to get take out. The restaurant has a nice decor and looked clean. We waited at the bar and the owner/ bartender took our order, while waiting he offered us water and free chips. The chips were very good, but a little too salty.  I ordered the vegetarian tostada and chips and guacamole, my wife ordered the carne asada tacos and vegetarian nachos. The service was very fast, the food came out in less than 10 minutes. The bill was a little high ($37) but we figured given the good atmosphere the food is probably worth it. When we got home we couldn't wait to tear into the food. Imagine our surprise when we opened the containers of food. I was given one child sized tostada and my wife was given one child sized  taco. The tostada was OK, but not worth the $6 or $7 bucks I paid. I'm not a huge fan of guacamole but I have to say that the guacamole was very good. It came with the same chips that they gave us in the restaurant. My wife said her taco and nachos were OK, but not much better than Chipotle.  When we first walked into North of Mexico we thought about coming back with some friends for dinner, after eating the food and given what they charge I don't know if we would come back. We may give it one more shot seeing that there are very few good Mexican restaurants in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, the lobster was great and they toned down the spicy items for the kids.  We went on Mother's Day and were serenaded with the kids by a live roaming guitarist.  A real treat"}
{"text":"Overpriced!!! This place looks good inside and we were very optimistic when we got there. The menu was confusing and the explanation from the server was poor. We thought we ordered dinner but only got these little appetizers (at the cost of a steak dinner). Everything tasted fresh but it was so small and way too expensive. Asked for a Corona (never was served the beer, but we were charged for it). They also had a guy going table to table playing guitar. He lingered at the table way too long playing right in our ears. Disappointing experience overall. If you want great Mexican head to Oshawa (Mexico-Lindo is amazing)."}
{"text":"Ahhh-ma-zing!     This restaurant is a newly-opened family-run business. I was a little hesitant about checking it out so soon after opening, but let me say that I am so glad that I did. The food was INCREDIBLE!  I have had my fair share of Mexican/tacos around the city (playa cabana, grand electric, seven lives, etc)  and this is the best yet.  Our table was all blown away with how good the food was.  We started with guac and homemade chips - nice and chunky served in a large stone mortar.  The tacos al pastor was delicious.  I had a bite of my friend's carne asada taco and it was equally if not even more tasty.  We also tried a few specials noted on the chalk board: octopus ceviche and lobster tostada - both incredibly juicy, fresh and very flavourful.  We had already entered our food coma, but couldn't resist having some churros for dessert.  I'm sure whatever you order, you will not be disappointed.   The staff were very pleasant, friendly, attentive and prompt, which seems to be a rarity with newly opened restaurants.  Warm atmosphere. Beautiful live edge wood bar.  Unfortunately no liquor license yet (we were told they'll have it in a few days), but we all intend on going back very soon and look forward to some margaritas.  It's a bit of a trek for us, but I'd be willing to drive for hours for food that good - no joke."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. I have rarely ever seen a place with so much taco variety. Lobster and Octapus tacos !!  I loved it.  Ribs were also great.  Overall the food dining experience was fantastic.  The vibe of this place makes you feel like you have been swept up and flown to a Mexican resort.  Lots of seating.  Service is absolutely awesome here.  Nobody can ever complain about the friendliness and competency of the staff.  People commented on food portions but I don't agree,  You are getting a very very high quality product and everything is extremely fresh!   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"North of Mexico... Is only good if you want a very light snack... Not for a meal... And certainly not for a family with children.  My family and I were excited to see a new place in town.. We looked in the window and saw a clean casual style restaurant, no linens, or fancy decor... we also saw the menu posted in the window that appeared to look simple and modern. Our family of 3 adults and 1 children walked in and sat down. The staff was pleasant and the service was very good. We all love Mexican food and was looking for a good meal and somewhere we can add to our family nights out. We all ordered 1 thing each. The descriptions of each item sounded wonderful... And our mouths were watering... We thought the prices were ok. On average $12.00 per item. Now you would think at 12.00 for a taco you would get a good portion with maybe a side of rice etc... But NO! We should have caught on when the waitress said she will leave the menus on the table for us... Which is very unusual, no? No, exaggeration the taco came on a tea cup size saucer.. No side, no nothing extra. Our 6 yrs old ate his in 3 mins and asked what are we having for dinner!? We each had a bottled soft drink at $4.00 each... Bottom line... $97.00 later and a starving family, we left disappointed, chalked the place off our family night outs places to go, and headed over to the Golden Arches... Sorry!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my chicken tacos but my carne asada was loaded with fat. It was quite disgusting. The staff is here is great and friendly. The portions are way too small. IMO I think tapas are a waste of money and 7 to 8 dollars for ONE SMALL TACO is a rip off. This place needs to come up with lower prices or it won't survive. I've called and asked if they have any lunch specials and the guy says, \"everything is a special for you honey...\" Umm yea ok. Don't get me wrong.... The food is good, service is great but the prices for what u are actually getting just doesn't seem worth it to me."}
{"text":"All thing considering, food was excellent, staff was friendly and I will definitely go back. I find it a little pricey though for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood spot with fresh, delicious food and excellent service and atmosphere. We loved it. . The short ribs were absolutely delicious and a great recommendation from our waiter.  The Sangria was excellent.   If you want a nice evening out with quality food, excellent service and a great atmosphere without having to drive downtown or pay for parking, North of Mexico is worth it."}
{"text":"FatCat not like to go to McDonalds after paying $70 for dinner. But he have no choice after this restaurant.  Thing FatCat like:  - Very lively and friendly staff  - Clean restaurant with good decor (for the neighborhood)  - Quality of food = good - but not warrant such high price.  Things FatCat not like:  - Portion sizes very small for price  - $12 Shots of Tequilla - go down very smooth, but leave wallet empty.  Friendly server tell FatCat story about breaking arm 3 times while playing soccer.  FatCat think server leave out many details from soccer story...  Like how neighborhood loan shark also like to play soccer, but only with people who don't pay back their debts."}
{"text":"This one is painful to write considering how much was spent.   The positives: it is very nice inside. Has a Miami feel to it and considering I've been around when this was a coffee shop and a bakery, it is a definite upgrade. The service here was on point and our waitress was very kind with a lot of energy. The owner gives everyone of age a tequila shot but for us we got two. Apparently he loves getting his patrons loosened up. We were seated promptly by the door but it was cold since they left it open. They were kind enough to close the door for us after. They gave free nachos with 3 different types of salsa. They also gave a habanero sauce with a lobster base that was pretty hot.   Negatives: Sighs so disappointed. I got the rib eye burrito which was very small. You thought that you were getting a kids size. It did taste nice but it wasn't filling and not enough inside. We got a beautifully presented pineapple sangria which was all slush. I couldn't taste the alcohol and it was hard to consume. They never told us the price and it was 17 dollars! I was not impressed at all. I've had drinks downtown for that price and at least I felt myself getting a buzz. This place is way too overpriced and for what you're getting, or not getting, definitely not worth going. The only reason I'm giving two stars is for the ambiance and service. Mucho burrito you can give me my Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, quite the find for Highland Creek.  I have eaten there twice, and very much enjoyed the meal both times.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but the portion sizes were good and filling and the Mojito's where huge and very tasty."}
{"text":"This is an interesting establishment in Highland Creek, that's for sure! First of all, it is Oaxacan style of Mexican food, which may not be very familiar to most. That said, I found it a bit pricey for what you get, but it is certainly authentic and not lacking in flavor. I had a Mojito (I know, this is Mexico, why get a Mojito, but I don't care!) which was tasty but too light on the mint. The lamb soup was excellent - a thick soup almost like a stew of delicious lamb in a heavily flavoured broth. The ribs are excellent - tender, extremely flavourful, with a potent chipotle sauce that delivers massive flavor without the sweetness people seem to compulsively add. The grilled vegetable plate was very tasty, with a nice blend of tomatoes, peppers, onions, mixed with cabbage and avocado served on beans and rice. I had two different tacos - the pulpo (octopus) and the al Pastor (pork). The pulpo was grilled, not seasoned enough and a bit too chewy, even for octopus. The al pastor used pineapple juice, not chunks of pineapple, and lacked cilantro so it seemed imbalanced in flavor. The churros were tasty and combined with fresh fruit which was nice, but pretty small. No question the food is very tasty here. Service was friendly and very fast. The music was a little loud for me, so not a place for a quiet conversation. And I felt that each dish was a little too pricey for what you got. I suppose you need to pay for a real Oaxacan experience, and if that's okay with you, then you will really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I struggle with this one as I'm between 3 and 4 stars.  Definitely overpriced and I think that taints the experience here, but if you remove price from the mix the food is actually really decent.  I think if they weren't trying to pitch themselves as high end Mexican I would give it a 4, but because they are claiming to be high end I have to be more critical.  Pros, Cons and What to Eat below.  Pro's - Great owner.  I love meeting folks who love what they are doing, are passionate, have a personality and are actually there in the restaurant. - Great staff.  Friendly, fast and knowledgeable about the menu - Cool Concept.  This is classified as \"high end\" authentic Mexican.  Definitely not Lone Star or Mucho Burrito - Decor. Nice place to eat, they have done a good job building a good looking restaurant - Fresh. For the most part the ingredients are fresh, brought in twice a week from the markets downtown, I appreciate that. - Some good quality stuff like lobster and shrimp, they are done well here. - Accommodated the kids well.  Cons - It's expensive.  2 of us and 1 child...$120!!  The justification, you are paying for the quality of the ingredients... - The problem is, I'm not sure it is as high end as they think it is.  If you are doing high end you have to do high end.  That means making your own tortillas (they order in), guacamole made to order (what we had was premade and cold, do that table side!), drinks made fresh to order (some of them like the pineapple one is just sitting in the fridge, could be why you can't taste the booze), and put some cool things on the menu you don't expect like a cactus salad.  North of Mexico you are competing with El Catrin (http://www.elcatrin.ca/home) in the Distillery, so if you are going to charge the big bucks you have to knock my socks off.  - I don't think you can charge $7 for a taco unless it has lobster, fois gras, kobe beef, or something like that in it IMO.  Stewed pork, stewed beef, stewed chicken even if it is good quality does not warrant that price.  I would expect 4 tacos for $7, then at least you are getting more into the \"tapas\" style that is pitched.     What to Get - OMG the cheesecake...it's sweet so split it with someone but seriously I would go there just for that - Taco De Carne Asada was solid - Camarones Tostada..great, probably our favourite - Guac tasted ok but again it was premade, pulled from the fridge, not very chunky  I don't know if we will go back for dinner, but the breakfast and brunch menu's look interesting and more affordable."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto on a family vacation, we left the zoo and just drove around looking for a place to eat.  By dumb luck we ended up at North of Mexico, and it was a wonderful surprise!  Summary: The owner was very friendly and made us feel like we were at  his home.  The waiter was sincerely attentive but not hovering.  The food was really good, and not the standard taco concepts (see below).  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the concept is similar to a tapas (little plates) method.  We were able to mix and match taco types (beef rib, pulled chicken, and well seasoned lamb).  The result was that people with different sized appetites can actually get end-portions appropriate to them!    As far as the quality, not only were the taco types interesting but they were very good quality!  Fresh ingredients, bright colors and flavors, and served thoughtfully.  For example, sometimes simple elegance trumps complexity: the guacamole was perfectly ripe avocados, mashed in large chunks with some lime, cilantro, and red onion, possibly some jalapeno.  Perfect!  I fully recommend North of Mexico, and wish it was local to our home so we could be regulars!"}
{"text":"The food is just OK.  Portions are very small and very over priced.  I thought we were ordering dinner but these are appetizer portions. Bottle beer is $7.  Margarita's are $9 and watered down.  Guac. was good.  $90 for 3 people.  Place was quite full on a Saturday evening.  I guess people were trying it out.   Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Small portions did taste ok but not memorable. Owner seems too interested in bottom line"}
{"text":"Considering its location and the quality of food that North of Mexico puts out, I'm really surprised at the ratings that it's receiving. That's why I'm updating my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  This place is certainly a diamond in the rough (i.e. good food in Highland Creek). Despite what some past reviewers have stated, I think the prices are very reasonable. The food is incredibly fresh and well done, and stuff like that costs money. Portions are appropriate.   If you're looking for large, cheap quantities of food, North of Mexico is not the place to go. There's a Domino's, KFC and Pizza Pizza down the street."}
{"text":"Very welcome addition to the community! The staff was very friendly and helpful and it was nice to enjoy our food outdoors on the tiny patio! Very tasty food!"}
{"text":"I didn't know paper was on the menu...  The ambiance of this place is very nice however the food is horrible. Very small portions for a very large price (that goes for both drinks and food). The food did not taste that great either to be quite honest. I ordered a tostado and they decided to put it over a checkered paper (I assume for decoration) however the juices from the tostado seeped through and I ate a piece by accident. They also forgot to add avocado and beans on my vegetarian tostado.   On top of all that, we received our bill and realized we were charged an extra 2$ for chips...NO ONE INFORMED US OF THIS CHARGE...  The waiter was really nice and checked in often however did lack knowledge regarding the menu which probably isn't his fault.   Would NOT recommend this place...even Taco Bell is better"}
{"text":"Step inside this restaurant and you'll forget that your still in Highland creek. Dark hardwood floors, terra cotta walls, dark wood tables adored with candlelight and tropical plants make you feel like your on vacation.  Upon entering a waiter kindly takes us to a table in the back corner. Soccer is playing on the tvs above the large bar in the back and projected on the wall on the opposite side. Corn chips and salsa are already waiting on the table for us to dig into. The waiter explains to us the three different salsas: one sweet which is made with pineapple and a mild and a hot one. He then brings us some water filled in an old tequila bottle and explains that the menus are tapas style and recommends we order a few dishes between us and shows us the specials written on chalkboards on the wall.  This is what we decide on ordering:  Taco de carne Asada -Seared rib-eye chimichurri Tender pieces of grilled steak with salsa and a mound of chimichurri on top all sitting beneath two small tortillas There was ample toppings so we split it between the two tortillas to make two small tacos  Carnitas - Braised slow cooked pork, cilantro onions, salsa verde The pork was really juicy and tender as well with crunchy pickled red cabbage was a nice contrast to the meat Again ample meat and toppings was perfect to split between the two underlying soft tortillas  Burrito De Pollo - Grilled Chicken, Pinto beans, rice, guaca, sour cream Juicy full of meat and toppings really loved the burrito especially the drizzling of mole on top - I really could of used more of it! The burrito also came with a nice little refreshing salad accompanying it.  After consuming these 3 dishes I have to be honest we were both still a bit hungry. The tacos and burrito are the small side so we decided to order one of the specials  Pollo Loco -Seared Chicken Breast in a Jalapeño Queso fresco sauce The dish came with two juicy but small chicken breasts sitting on a mound of peas and rice with sauteed peppers and cabbage. The jalepno queso fresco sauce was delicious but was not the least bit hot more sweet and creamy but I did enjoy it none the less.  Finally for dessert we couldn't resist but to order the churros. Two small churros came piping hot and crispy covered in cinnamon sugar were a perfect ending to our Mexican meal. Oh and coffee here is great!  Overall I have to say service wise everything was perfect, our waiter consistently checked up on us, refilled drinks, and was very friendly. The food was very fresh and came out fast. However I won't lie the portions are sort of on the small side and I was also expecting a little bit more heat/spice but I'm sure had I asked for it they probably could of made it more spicy for my liking. However for a place like this in this neck of the woods the ambiance can't be beat."}
