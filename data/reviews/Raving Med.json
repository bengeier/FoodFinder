{"text":"Place is extremely dirty and the layout is backwards.  The fresh cut fries were good but the chicken shawarma pita was nothing special, more then half of it went in the trash.  Exhaust fans must not work b/c we went back to work smelling like food after being inside for less than 10 min."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the price! Plus if you're a CSU student you get 10% off your order. Got this after class one day, they were closing in twenty minutes and still offered to let my boyfriend and I sample all the toppings you could get, which was just what we needed since we weren't familiar with Mediterranean. We got the falafel pita which was amazing, taste bud heaven. The lentil soup and fries were also amazing! A must try!"}
{"text":"Tried this the other day before they were officially open (they open Monday 6/20 FYI) The staff and owner were really friendly and I think they will only get better as they have more practice. I took the suggestions of the staff and had the falafel pita. I had Israeli salad and pickled cabbage with tzatziki sauce. They fry the falafel fresh as your order and serve them in a homemade pita.  I also got the mint lemonade which was sweet and fantastic! Really awesome drink for a summer day! I think this restaurant has a great future and I can't wait to go back for more! I would totally recommend it to students and theatre goers alike. Great location, good service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing great, falafel was okay but nothing special, toppings were overly salty and oily. Pita they offered was not the traditional, but overly thick/bready pita. Atmosphere was okay, very awkward arrangement of having to squeeze past other customers to order.  Not awful, not great. A seemingly americanized take on mediterranean. I won't be back but some people may enjoy."}
{"text":"We arrived just after 6 on 5/22 to have dinner before a show at Playhouse Square and wound up having to go to another restaurant. They were out of pita and pita chips, no soup left, very disappointed. Maybe we'll give it another try at some future date, but if we go to a Mediterranean restaurant we don't want to eat the hummus with a spoon."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. They opened about three months ago, and their food is next level. We ended up talking to the owner, Jules (who is super nice), and she and her staff make the falafel and toppings fresh daily. Not only is the falafel the best I've had, but with salads and sandwiches you get your choice of toppings and you're not limited to a few - you can add as many as you want. They have hummus, babaghanoush, pickled beets, pickled cauliflower, marinated peppers and eggplant ... the list goes on, and all of the toppings are incredibly flavorful. Plus, the average price is around $7 for a falafel sandwich/salad and I couldn't even finish mine ... it was a lot of food. We loved our experience here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was so good and so interesting and so different.  I was just picking things at random and my stuffed pita came out amazing but I know I will be back again and again to try different combinations.  Not even sure what it was that I liked so much, I think it was one of the vegetables which is crazy for a carnivore like me, but I really think it was.  Will definitely be back to experiment."}
{"text":"We arrived at this Raving Med close to their closing time on the way to the Indians game. I think because it was so close to closing time it made the experience underwhelming. The staff was not very knowledgeable about what the various toppings were after they wrapped up and after we made our choices they put some of the wrong stuff on our shawarma and falafel. Another problem was they were in such a rush to close that the falafel balls were not fried enough so they were grainy and cereal tasting on the inside. Lastly, the tables and the countertops weren't clean which was a little unsettling.   I know this place has potential since we heard so many good things from friends who visited before us and they have some very creative sauce and salad choices for their pitas and bowls. May try to give Raving Med a chance when they are busy and have more time."}
{"text":"Delicious salads with lots of options. Set up like a Chipotle. Love it for something quick!!"}
{"text":"Last evening I had the very best Pita Sandwich of my life at Raving Med.   the best Hummus too!  Raving Med is a new Mediterranean street food restaurant located in the Keith Building next to Playhouse Square. It is fantastic.  Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"While the relatively drab decor and sparse signage may put off patrons seeking zest and verve in their lunch environs, those that can look past cosmetic concerns will find something truly noteworthy in Raving Med. The concept is build-your-own Mediterranean grub, with customers cramming in a narrow ordering area, and selecting victuals for their pita or bowl from an elegantly spiced gallimaufry below. The staff are ebullient if occasionally given to tarrying. The falafel is made to order and expertly crisped, with a slightly creamy and nourishing center (sans that bolus-inducing desert-dry heaviness of the grocery store variety). The pickled cauliflower, the beets, the hummus and baba, and most especially the tahini with spicy shug are uniformly outstanding. Perfectly portioned. Superbly priced. You're not likely to find such a well-textured, sweet/spicy, and totally tantalizing lunch for $7.75 anywhere else downtown. If there are complaints to be had they would center on the non-compostable containers and surfeit of plastic silverware (and the odd red takeout bags--\"did I order falafel?\" one befuddled diner asked, \"or some sort of biohazard material?\"). There is a beautiful simplicity here bordering on the sublime. The Romantic. One could see Wordsworth munching his bowl on the edge of a burbling brook, or Blake painting the pickled beets with broad crazed strokes and jagged haloes. If only they'd go a bit more Green, that vision could become a reality. In Playhouse Square, did Raving Med a perfect lunch decree..."}
{"text":"Not quite what I was expecting in terms of quality of prep and ingredients. Staff was generous with portion but not very friendly. 3 stars are for large portion and taste because it did taste pretty good I think due to the fact that Mediterranean food is pretty hard to mess up."}
{"text":"Let me just say this - their food is 5 stars. Very very tasty. But their customer experience is 3 stars. So, I'm only giving 4 stars, and I hope that as time passes, they up their game.  I've been in here 3 times now, and I've had a falafel pita twice, and a chicken schwarma bowl once. The pita itself is delicious - one of the best I've ever had. Thick and chewy without being doughy or dry. It also holds together better than I would have ever expected it to, when it's packed with all the toppings they fit in there. Makes a great sandwich. The falafel is also great - great flavor, made to order, good crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. The chicken schwarma (shaved off of a spit) is flavorful and juicy, with the right amount of crisp on the edges. I also love all the toppings! I'm a big fan of pickled veggies, and the selection here does not disappoint. Plus all those brightly colored veggies make for a colorful meal - bright pink and magenta pickled beats and turnips, orange pickled carrots and cauliflower, a turmeric seasoned pickled veggie mix... drool! Everything I've put in my mouth here is fresh and delicious.  Now, the customer experience. This place is a fast-casual (think, chipotle) place. But the whole setup is kind of awkward. You walk in, and have to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order, squeezing through a narrow space to get in line behind the people who are currently ordering. They have some signs (that look like chipotle rip-off signs) to explain the options (bowl, pita, salad; chicken schwarma, turkey schwarma, falafel, chicken schnitzel) but no signage for the toppings. And it isn't really clear from looking at things what they are. Are they spicy? pickled? fresh? This leads to asking what each thing is, or just sort of pointing and guessing what might be good. Esp. when they're busier, this is tough. The big signs are made of foam board and look really temporary (they're already kind of ripped up). The first time I went, they had JUST opened, and it seemed like the staff didn't know what stuff was, and they were kind of tripping over each other on the line, but that seems to have improved some. Also, I would never want to dine in here... no ambiance whatsoever. Just black tables and black vinyl chairs. No decorations. Not really a very welcoming place. Also, it's really hard to see the signage from the outside at all... no curb appeal at all. If I hadn't known to look for it, I may never have discovered it! I hope all this stuff is temporary and that they work on their aesthetics and customer experience, because the food really does stand on its own! And it's great to have another lunch option in Playhouse Square that is something other than American food/sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place certainly has potential. It could do with a more on brand atmosphere and decor. It could also use help with its signage. Adding mini descriptions under the meat types would be useful as would re-ordering the menu boards (i.e., putting the pick an entree board next to the start here sign for example).   Details aside the food was good. The staff happily explained the process and options (i.e., bowl with rice or lettuce or a pita with your pick of protein). A manager also offered a taste of any of the fillings that we may have been unfamiliar with. I found the various toppings I chose flavorful. They all were cold, which can be a bit unique against the hot chicken and rice, however I enjoyed all my selections. I tried the hummus; roasted red peppers; and the pickled beets, carrots, cauliflower and onions.  This was definitely a fast lunch and one that felt relatively healthy. If I had to pick a favorite bowl place downtown I would still I think side with Rebol."}
{"text":"what a gem in the middle of downtown! uh may zing!!!! fresh pita, incredible falafel, wow the shwarma is killer. such a fun place, authentic, ya all gotta get to this place, its off the charts!!!"}
