{"text":"You will never believe the story I'm about to blog about. It is all about a bouncer that stands outside the entrance of Cabana Pool Bar, his name is James.  My friends and I bought tickets weeks in advance to go to Cabana Pool Bar to see Lil Jon DJ, they came in from Ottawa just for this event. I live in Toronto so I was in charge of showing them a good time. We went to Cabana Pool Bar on Saturday (July 9th) and got to the entrance of Cabana and one of my friends had a can of beer in his hand. Myself or my friends didn't even notice he had it mostly because he is the quiet one of the bunch. James the bouncer stopped us and said he needed to get rid of his drink. That's when we looked at our friend and laughed at him and told him he couldn't have it there. Embarrassed, he went and threw it out and came back and said he didn't know he couldn't have it and offered an apology up front. James then said \"you can't stand there and tell me you didn't know you can't have alcohol\" and my friend said \"no, I really didn't\". We explained we were from Ottawa and that my friends didn't know the rules here so James prompted a response from all of us and involved the whole group and said \"So none of you saw him with the can he had when he walked up here?\" we all said no. He continued by saying there is no way you didn't all know that, that's bullshit and I'm telling you right now I'm not buying that shit today\" that's when we realized he was attempting to inflate the situation. we all just said sorry so it would be done with. he let us walk past to the other bouncer that was checking ID then he called us all back and said \"if you are from Ottawa then you should know there's no drinking here, its the same rules in Ottawa so don't give us that bullshit next time\" I then finally interjected because he was speaking to all of us at that point and it has already gone to far (10 minutes past when my friend threw out his drink to far to be exact.) I said \"look, the drink is gone, you already let us go, we never said anything else to you and whats done is done right?\" hoping he would leave us be with my let-bygones-be-bygones type plea he then said to me \"So your gonna stand there and deny that he ever had alcohol in his hand?\" I knew then that he was going to try any stretch to start up a fight and we weren't getting in. Once someone starts making comments like that you know they are there for a fight only, not with the intention of doing his job. I said \"I never said he didn't have alcohol we never denied that\" and he said \"yes you are, yes you are, you think I'm stupid\" this went on for about another 5 minutes bringing us to 15 minutes the whole time the friend who had the drink waited back by a tree and never interacted with him. he kept calling him and pointing to him saying he was drinking and he wasn't letting drunk people in the facility. I went to the other bouncer and I asked him why James was acting like that and what we should do and he said \"your best bet is just to listen to him and let him talk, it should be fine\" it sounded like the other bouncer knew what he was like and that he takes his authoritative stance this way often. I walked away and I mumbled \"hes so rude\" and one of my girlfriends with us that was standing off to the side said \"yea he is power-tripping like I've never seen before\" and he heard us and told my boyfriend that was still pleading for him to let it all go that he heard us and now there's no way were getting in at all. My boyfriend said \"Look I'm sorry you heard that but we mean well and....c'mon just cut us a little slack here we came to have a good time\"  he said \"No, I'm rude right?, I'm power tripping right? I'm this and that right? I don't have to take this he turned his back to him and said \"Go find somewhere else to have a good time, your not getting in here.\" I started taking notes on everything at that time and stayed out of it. We never swore at him, we never made loud comments or wild gestures or anything towards him. it was a small situation that we would classify as an honest mistake blown out of proportion to a large scale in a one sided fight by James who was hoping to get an aggressive reaction out of us. He never got it. After the other bouncer finally started to wave us all in I'm not sure how he was able to bypass James but he let all 6 of us in. Later one of our friends left for 5 mins and came back and James said aren't you the guy who had the beer earlier, my friend said no and he wouldn't let him back in, He had mistaken him for the only other black person we were with!! Cabana is great, the facility is great and the staff are too. but they need to be careful who they hire to be at the door to leave a first and last impression because they get reviews like this that way. Beware of James he is an Asian bouncer with a very large build about 5'6."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. We went for a friend's 40th birthday party and I had a good time with my friends but the place in general is just kind of douchey.   I'll start with the good. The location can't be beat. You're on the water, looking at the skyline of Toronto. If the weather is good then there's nothing like being outside in the sun with your friends. Staff was pretty good and the food was decent for a bar. Everyone seems too worried about their hair and makeup to go into the pool so we pretty much had it to ourselves, which was fun.   Now the bad and it is inescapable. This place is filled with Jersey Shore douchebags. There's really no other way to put it. It's unfortunate since the place could be a lot cooler if the clientele weren't so douchey. If it was a lot more chill I would certainly be back a few times this summer.   All this being said, I did enjoy the day with friends. Our cabana was $1500 reserved in advance and included bottle service and some food. It gave us access to the pool and free towels (normally $20 to get in, $20 to get in the pool and $5 for towels so that's pretty much $45 before you eat or drink anything so it's worth it).   For me, the clientele was too much and I wouldn't go back but I would recommend considering booking a cabana and splitting the cost with friends. It seems to be the best option (I think that they start at $1,000 - not bad if you divide it up by 15 people)."}
{"text":"Douchebag Central. There's extra charge for everything, including breathing it seems. You can smoke by the pool but you can't drink beyond the blue line and you'll be reprimanded if you cross it by an inch. The pool is small for such a huge place. There's limited space and we were asked to move, again, because we settled in the wrong place. This is a place for conspicuous consumption and people who buy into that. Disgusting. They can get away with this as there's not much competition around."}
{"text":"Literally the best times of my life have been had here. Location perfect (lots of space to dance, walk, entertain, etc.), cost perfect (and worth it, also weeds out the type of people who come to these events), atmosphere perfect. Great looking, friendly people and staff. Dance, swim and lounge the days away here, everyone is just there to have a good time. It's the only place in Toronto where it feels like you're on a complete vacation. I've never had an issue with service, ordering food or drinks is fast and very generous."}
{"text":"With the extreme advisory alert yesterday, I decided to visit  with my baby (10 months) so I can dip her in the pool to cool off and hang out by the pool. Lunch was had, paid almost $100 (worth $25 tops), $40 for 2 people to swim, and $10 for towels -- needless to say, not a cheap day. The chaise lounges were first come first served basis. I spoke with the manager (Nedo) regarding access to cabanas for the baby whenever she needs a little shade. His response was as follows: Order bottle service or rent for $1000, and proceeded to walk away. He was rude. No other ways to describe it. I will not go back there again. I was a patron, since it was \"the docks\", but wow, I can't believe that they have this person representing their business. Statement made - we don't need business from mothers or children. What a disappointment.  Cabana owners:  there are a lot of moms that are interested in being more active with their babies outdoors in sleek and posh places as your establishment claims to be... You will not be the first choice with the attitude of your manager and current policies."}
{"text":"Complete rip off. I went with a couple of friends and we spent $500. This place won't be in business for long. Trying to be Miami alike but complete failure. The crowd isn't great either. Never going again. Save ur money."}
{"text":"My expectations of this place weren't high after hearing about other experiences, BUT I actually had a pretty great time!  I feel like if you're going to go here, pay the extra $20 to enjoy the pool - and go early. My friends and I came here 30 minutes after they opened, and had a good hour or two to enjoy the pool almost to ourselves. The mojitos and pi√±a coladas were pretty good, as well! Sadly we still didn't get one of the few chairs by the pool.  My biggest complaint: it seems messed up to only offer shade/seats to those willing to pay thousands of dollars for a cabana. Sadly, the day ended with some minor heat stroke."}
{"text":"Amazing venue, experience. Got a booth here. Quite expensive but it rules out broke people.  This is a higher end club and people should not expect to pay $2 to get in. If your looking to spend that, goto a hipster bar.  Amazing drinks, venue, experience and view of Toronto, I will be back."}
{"text":"Lets picture this. The Cabana Pool Bar alone without current staff and clients.  PERFECT  Enough said....  I went on a Friday with a good friend. Bouncer a frustrated guy and the door girls asking me if I was on the guest list. (Friday free cover)  I say yes and they start asking thousand questions with an unwelcoming attitude like not to let me in. Is this what a VIP event?   B....please just let me in that I am getting thirsty. Place at its 30% capacity, you are scaring away customers with this idiotic attitude. If you want to google analyze me send me an electronic survey.  Anyways. The crowd try to hard. period.  FUNNY STORY: See this girls catching the bus while I am driving to Cabana. Wearing shades and obnoxiously dressed, even could smell their lack of classiness, 15 min later BAM I see them at Cabana talking to this guys about their \"high status in society\". LOOOL had to spare them discretely some 20 dollar for their ride back on the TTC.    Drinks: Mojitos with gone bad mint leafs.   In few words the staff correlates to the customers."}
{"text":"Omg the place is filthy!!!!!!!!!!!   I went for an event so I didn't have to pay anything. I will never recommend this place.   From the pictures online, it looked so pretty but I guess they had a super good photographer. When we got it, it was fine.... But when we had to eat, every table had stains or FOOD crumbs on it. I was soooo disgusted.... Even when we sat at the booth, the seats had hair stuck to it and food stains and splashes. It was just horrible.   I will say the service is alright but the view just isn't worth it. If I can't sit down at a place confidently, there's no way I can go..... The pool area wasn't any cleaner...    Gross!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cabana is like Marmite, you either love it or hate it. I personally think it is a great concept and idea. Where else can you lounge in open air, drink, hear some great djs and all with an amazing view of Toronto.  The location is slightly out the way and the car park right next to it dares to charge $35! So better to park just before T&T for $10.   The cover is $20 that will give you access to the whole area in front of the DJ booth, but the sly thing is if you want to get to the pool and that specific area you have to pay $20 more or have a Cabana there booked. From having booked a cabana in past i can tell you it is a waste of time. The pool area is where all the bottle flies buzz from booth to booth. The best area is infront of the DJ booth where the real atmosphere is.  The prices are....standard for any club type venue. The food is actually really good. The staff for the most part are pretty friendly and Cabana this season has had some real good DJs in. Even Will Smith came here to party."}
{"text":"Just when you thought you could relax on a Sunday and avoid the pretentious atmosphere of the Toronto nightclub scene, here comes Cabana putting all your dark club sins and behaviour on blast in the middle of the day under the blazing sun (with the exception of this summer).  Modeled after the popular Vegas pool bar \"meat markets,\" Cabana has managed to totally own the day time summer party life in Toronto - if you're willing to pay for it that is. As others mentioned already, it's $20 to get in, and $40 to get in the pool area. And that's just general admissions to the party. You will empty your bank account here buying drinks by day. However, if you think that buying a bottle buys you a smidgen of prestige as it used to in nightclubs... think again.  Purchasing bottles, while draining on the average person's bank account, merely get's you a table in the stable. The average person doesn't even get close the true Cabana experience, unless you're dropping some serious coin on private Cabana's here.  Now I know I sound like bitchin, so let me shout out some of the perks:  - Single fellas, the ratio here is stagerringly in your favour easily a 70:30 girl to guy ratio. And those gals... ain't wearing a whole lot of anything. So you can leave your imaginations at home, just polish your peepers because all the world is a show here  - Hookahs, yep they've got them everywhere. And from what I could see, there were the normal one for you average Joes, and the hopped up turbo ones which were for the have's (as opposed to the have-nots/have-less  - View of Toronto, spectacular! They've built Cabana to face west so that from the moment they open to the moment they close, you've got full sun the entire day. And as I said the views of the water and the skyline are the best around  - Hilarious, more juiced up dudes in tank tops than you can shake a stick at. Go ahead and shake a stick at them... seriously, they're necks aren't going to turn too fast. I mean I take pride in my appearance but if jeez, these guys.... the redefined definition of GTL (with some added fresh to death hair cuts and body hair removal).  - Music, if you're into electro, edm, etc, they play some of the best around! Definitely great music and amazing DJ's  So in summary, this place... it's good. I've been once so I don't need to go again... check it out for yourself and you'll see."}
{"text":"Not too much to say. It's a fun atmosphere to be in. One of the first venues like this Toronto has seen which is also why it is so popular. Feels as if you aren't even in your own city anymore. The music is good and it's nice to be able to party and still be home at a decent hour for work the next morning. I've been on Saturdays and Sundays and it's busy each time. It's ridiculously overpriced, but they do it because they can..where else is anyone going to go that is a venue like this except for Muzik, which is probably just as much.  Waiting for a drink at the bar is just annoying. I usually get the same bartender every time I'm there and she seems to only pay attention to one corner of the bar. Takes almost 15 mins sometimes to get her attention.  The female washroom is nice..fully of mirrors and a big \"bed\" you can sit on."}
{"text":"I am torn -- on one hand, I should have known not to expect good service given they've already made $40 off of you before you even buy a drink, but I guess I was distracted by the gorgeous setting?  I spent the day here on Saturday hanging out with my friends and enjoying the sun. Yes, it's pretentious, but surely you knew to expect that? It really did feel like a getaway without having to get on a plane. The food was quite good and our bartender was amazing.  Near the end of the night, I realized my phone had gone missing. Given that there was the possibility that it could have been picked up by a member of staff, I spoke to the first person I saw who worked there. I was given a look that could only be described as being full of contempt, and told \"phones get stolen here all the time.\" That's it, that's all. Even if that were the case -- and surely they should realize this is not a normal state of affairs?! -- she could have at least pretended to be helpful. I went to the \"lost and found\" and the woman didn't even get off of her personal cell phone long enough to tell me that nothing had been turned in. No offer to take my name or anything.  So, bring lots of cash, sunscreen, and watch your belongings like a hawk!"}
{"text":"Give the star for pretty waitresses. I've been to cabana several times this summer, Fridays are usually better and Sundays are the worst, water quality is very bad, dead bugs and garbages in the water.  Last Sunday my friends and I (we are all girls) were chilling and floating in the pool, a group of guys (white and brown) came and ask if we are Chinese, we said yes and they flipped us into water. Despite of racism, what they did was also dangerous, you don't know us and we might be hurt. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Went there july 22 around 8 p.m. Asian no-neck stone-faced guy at the entrance tells me the place is closed.  Clearly it wasn't (and I'd put myself on the guestlist earlier).  Too many Indians in the place, I'm guessing.  No time for garbage like this. Even if you don't think this would affect you, take a stand and take a pass."}
{"text":"It is great at what it does - for those whose scene this is, they would love it (and they do).    If this is not your scene, you will feel it right away, and no amount of drinking can change that.  People watching at its best though, you could legitimately just plop yourself somewhere and watch people and kill 5 hours."}
{"text":"Cabana Pool Bar is a great place to swim and splash around during the day. During the evening it turns into a night club and really isn't my style. The day time lounging is fantastic with one exception.   The service is atrocious! On my first outing to Cabana I had to wait 4 hours before I got my first order of food. On my second journey to Cabana, it was slightly better but I had to state the name of the lady who told me to let her know when I arrived. If I hadn't stated her name, service would have taken hours like during my first visit to Cabana. After I stated the ladies name I was able to order my first dish immediately. After she left I was unable to order another dish for a couple of hours as I was trying to flag down a waitress."}
{"text":"I hate most clubs, but this one is my favourite, and it's mostly because of Manzone and Strong and the amazing atmosphere. As my favourite DJs (really proud that they are Toronto based), I feel like I am in heaven here on a Sunday afternoon. Combined with beautiful summer weather and an incredible view, I really don't need anything else. I keep my clothes on, and I don't even go near the pool, because that is not what I am there for.   It is expensive. I don't think you can complain about cover ($20, but I believe it's less or nothing at all weekdays) because, umm, look at where you are. Other crap clubs charge the same for cover when someone should actually be paying you to go into those places. The shisha is pricey (35), as are the drinks, but I have such an amazing time here, that I'm like, please take my money. After I spend at least 40 minutes waiting for shish... Service is slow. You have to flag those gals down and then maybe remind them, hopefully just once, of what you ordered. Getting drinks isn't so bad. Oh, and parking. It's 20. I really can't go without spending less than 100 if I really want to have a good time. But it's all worth it for me. I don't go for the plastic tits, the fake tans, and they don't ruin my mood, because I'm there for the atmosphere and the music. The only reason I am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars, is because I absolutely cannot stand smoke, and when it gets busy (4:00 and after), it's really everywhere, which really ruins it for people like me, because unless it's raining and dead, I have to leave. They should really have a smoking area. But honestly, I can't get enough of this place. This is the one place I know Manzone and Strong will kill it and play the absolute best house, not trying to please the crowd with garbage EDM, top 40, etc."}
{"text":"We went to Cabana as a surprise for my birthday. The cover was a pretty steep $20 for or $40 for the pool. We didn't want to go in the pool, which we sort of regretted because the pool seemed more fun. Nonetheless the cost for pool access is way too much.  As we entered, we saw around a 70:30 ratio of girls to guys. The place was all white and actually looked very clean and fun. We then went to get some drinks which were expensive - around $8 per shot and the shot glasses were tiny too. They provided 2 pool tables, 1 ping pong table and a foosball table. We played a few rounds of pool where the loser had to take 2 shots. Unfortunately i lost twice lol, but its ok because it was my bday haha.  They played soccer on the big screen by the pool which was cool, but i actually preferred to listen to music instead of watch the game...so we walked closed to where the music was.  We ordered Miami Vice and was very unimpressed as it was all liquid and tasted like Pepto Bismol. Yuck.  Cabana was fun, but not amazing. Maybe a 1 or 2 times visit per summer."}
{"text":"Once you get through the convoluted pathway of security checkpoints and the tuck shop where tickets for the pool are sold (which no one will tell you until the bouncer at the pool entrance stops you and tells you that you need another wristband), the pool scene is actually quite fun.  There is a DJ spinning a mix of club beats, hip hop, and a lot of Lana Del Ray for some reason.  Cabanas for bottle service surround the perimeter while pool chaises which are first come first serve surround the pool area.    If this place is going to continue, however, they really need to deal with their washroom facilities.  First of all, there are NO CHANGE ROOMS.  Pretty convenient for a pool that you pay $30 to get into, right? The toilets became more and more clogged over the course of the day, until eventually a toilet flooded the entire washroom.  Girls were running through a cesspool of TOILET WATER in bare feet while the poor washroom attendant tried to mop a puddle of toilet water that was an inch thick.  Disgusting!  I give it 2 stars for the pool scene, but this place really needs to get their shit together (literally) in terms of organization, cleanliness, and facilities."}
{"text":"u must be very careful here,, the workers there are tough rough and ready for a fight, very expensive, bad service, shady place to be just know go at your own risk,"}
{"text":"Terrible experience but mostly because of my \"friend\" making me search for him in the crowd and wifi didnt work there. so be aware!  lol i still give two stars since it is not cabana fault if i had a shitty flaky friend :)"}
{"text":"First time coming to this club. I've hear a lot of stories going in so I had some expectation going in.  It's a pretty nice club and being the only pool day club in Toronto its unique. We had a booth setup for a friends birthday party. The service from our server was on point she took really good care of us and our needs. I would definitely come back for the great service and friendly staff if for nothing else.   Great experience overall. Too bad it's seasonal but that's Toronto for you."}
{"text":"This cr@p place hires dumb animals for security guards that group up and beat on customers."}
{"text":"Bring your best fashion game. Had a lot of fun but getting service in this place is impossible. We sat down and a server came to get us some drinks and we ordered 2 Caesars. 30 minutes later she still didn't get someone who would take our shisha order (as we requested with the Caesars) and our drinks were nowhere to be seen. We took matter into our own hands and went directly to the bartender. Afterwards we relocated so as to try to get better service and that didn't work. We had to ask 3 times to get a server and once we finally did, our day turned around. Our server was so sweet and helpful so that made things better. Music and drinks were great, shisha was $35 but totally worth it as it was some of the best I've had. We didn't use the pool but everything else was nice (besides the service initially). The service in the washroom however was phenomenal LOL we got better service in the bathroom than when initially ordering! You know there's a problem when... to sum it up, everything is great, but be prepared to work to get a server's attention."}
{"text":"It's like you're at a beach resort party. While the experience was surreal, I was very disappointed after looking at my bank statement online. There were three transactions which totalled approx $200. Cabana Pool Bar_F - $53.40 Cabana Pool Bar - $77.63 Rebel Nightclub - $50.03 There is definitely some sort of scam going on at this place.  Lesson Learned - take cash with you. Never use credit/debit at this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great vibe, great music (if you're into the EDM scene), and an amazing view. Make sure to go early to avoid a crazy line-up to get into the place.   Love the idea of this place and would definitely go back. Only wish it was cheaper ($20 for admission and another $20 for pool access)."}
{"text":"I got there before 3pm on a Sat (free for girls before 3pm on Sat) and there were long line ups to get in. The line splits and you wouldn't know which to go (guest list vs ticket vs paying counter) until you're in it. You first show them ID and check in the guestlist and they'll give you a wristband.  No water bottles!   It was Canada Day weekend so there were red balloons and pretty much all the guests were wearing red and white. Loud mainstream club music was playing. Nice views of the skyline.   You'll definitely get to soak the sun. It's hard to find a place to sit as most of Cabana's space is the reserved booths. But there is an indoor area where you can sit and the entrance dock has some white benches too (quieter too).  For entertainment, soccer was playing on the big screen, there are a couple of pool tables and foosball. There is a little snack bar and at least 3 full bars. There were some dancing girls on tables and a hot tub on the upper balcony. There are security guards at every corner. I must say, the pool is small and crowded! It is blocked by an entrance gate so you can't get too close to it.   Summer party vibes and lots of sun. You'll just most likely be standing."}
{"text":"A great place to lay back and forget of the speed of everyday life. Day Life - Vegas - Miami style accompanied with food from O&B, kings of high end catering, music from the best DJ's in the world. What else do you need?!"}
{"text":"An overwhelming \"meh\". Went on a Saturday, arrived pretty much for opening at 1pm. Advertised cover on the website was $20, but they were charging $25 when we showed up (meh).   On first arrival, the place looked alright. We played a game of foosball and then went to the bar and grabbed a drink. It was at that time we realized that the dj wasn't actually djing, but phoning it in with a pre-recorded mix set. Around 2pm he actually started playing live (which is more than meh, just plain lame). The music was a mix of house which went dramatically more top 40 and rap focused, with no shortage of Drake (again, meh). I guess Sundays have more house music?   Drinks are $8.50 + tip for a can of beer or standard bar rail. The prices go up as you add anything deemed \"premium\" like spiced rum, for example. We toyed with the idea of bottle service as we wanted a table area with shade coverage. Turns out that they wanted a 3 bottle minimum for any of these areas. Anything less would just get you a table and chair area without any shade (super meh).  At $240 per bottle, we quickly decided against that and hung out by the dj booth where there was at least some shade to be had. Oh, and worth mentioning is that the bottle is $240, but that does not include tax or the 18% auto gratuity they add to your bill. Doing the math on that, you're actually paying more per drink than you would buying them individually from the bar (oh yeah, that's totally meh!).  The one thing that really stood out to me is the pageantry. And look, I get it... People want fancy booths with bottle service to show off their worth, and here we are in a Miami inspired pool bar where this shit is going to be prevalent... But when ordering bottles, serving girls come out with the bottles raised high in the air, and creating signage with peoples names and even waving big flags emblazing the Cabana logo. I'll admit I'm just not the \"look at me!\" guy when it comes to clubs and bars, so I'm not their target demographic, but this was pretty ridiculous and eye-roll inducing.  The one positive? The random people in attendance that we talked to all seemed to be having a good time and surprisingly little attitude. But even with the right crowd, some places just aren't that much fun. And with this place, the pool bar novelty does wear off pretty quickly, especially once you notice how much money you've spent over the course of the day."}
{"text":"For something in Toronto, it's not bad. It's like a vegas pool bar but less bougie, more expensive (YEAH.. I KNOW RIGHT? I'm surprised too) and more ratchet, if possible. If you enjoy day drinking, this place is for you. If you enjoy long summer days in the sun, this is the spot for you. If you enjoy DJs and EDM, this is DEFINITELY the spot for you. I enjoy all of the above, so yes. I quite enjoyed myself.   We bought tix for the event, so that was $20 and we didn't have to pay additional $ for the pool, for some reason. WHICH WAS BAD, BECAUSE I ENDED UP THROWING MY IPHONE INTO THE POOL. UGH. #StillSalty. I'd love to get a booth here, because it's super bougie but still chill at the same time. The chairs are also nice to chill on. They also have tons of shisha here, pool tables and a small dance floor area - seriously, how packed was it when Oliver Heldens came to town?!?!  Everything is so pricey here. A drink is $13 lol bye  Beautiful view but bad location - you pretty much HAVE to drive here. Rough.  I'd love to get a booth here because it's so pretty but I'm sure it's hella $$$"}
{"text":"Venue is perfect for corporate events, accommodating more than a thousand people. Lots of lounge areas and with a pool, allowing you to cool off while appreciating the great view of Toronto. An indoor venue is likewise available with a big stage  suitable for live band shows or indoor parties. Was there for a corporate event so do call them up for more details on reservations and pricing."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to take the time to write a negative review unless I have had an extremely bad experience. So that says a lot..  The service here was TERRIBLE. The first issue I had was when the woman at the door was rummaging through my purse and examining my prescription medication.  I had my name, doctor's contact information, and prescription number written on the bottle. She then proceeded to embarrass me by asking me (in front of our entire party) what the medication was for, opened and examined the medicine, and told me that in Canada the bottles are different. No shit they are different than the US- but you are also very close to the US border so you should be aware of that. This went on for a good 5 minutes and was extremely embarrassing. I understand you are trying to monitor the use of illegal drug use, but this was PRESCRIBED medication that had ample information on the bottle to prove so. Please train your employees to know the difference between illegal narcotics and a perfectly legal prescription that I need to carry with me.   Our waitress (Shauna K) was terrible. She ignored us the entire time. It took about forty mins to get our $495 bottle of Ketel One Vodka we ordered. I don't understand this because all she had to do was bring it out and place it on our table. This was right at 1pm and we were one of two parties there at the time, so she definitely wasn't busy. Not only did our alcohol take a long time, but the food was even worse. We ordered our food at 2pm (Fixed Platter 1) and only received the watermelon and pine nuts. When we asked her where the rest of our food was, she told us that they brought it to someone else's table by mistake. We were fine with it because we know mix-ups happen. What really aggravated me was that she didn't bring the rest of our food out until we were getting ready to leave, after us asking her 3 separate times to check on the food (around 4:30/5:00pm). I don't understand how it takes 2 and  1/2 hours to bring out nachos, fries, and spring rolls (not to mention I could get better appetizers at Applebees). Another thing that didn't sit well with me is that we had ONE male guest in our party and they wanted to charge him (and only him) to use the pool (the pool resembles a Kiddie pool at a crappy amusement park). That is insane to me. We had a bill of $1,333.46 for two bottles of vodka and sub-par appetizers that took 2 and  1/2 hours to get to our table. You really couldn't have let our ONE male guest enter the pool area?   The main issue I had was the fact that the woman I reserved the cabana through INSISTED that the only way I could make a reservation is if I emailed her my CC info. I was hesitant, but did it anyways because we really wanted to come here. Fast forward to 2 days after we get back from cabana and I have over $800 of fraudulent charges on my credit card (all transactions in Toronto). I live in Buffalo and the only time I used this card at all during our trip to Toronto was at Cabana. SKETCHYYYY.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Update!!!   After seeing that video with the guy get a beaten up by the bouncer I honestly think I'm not coming back here period! This place is going to go under a lot of people on Google Facebook and other social media is going to sink club like a ship! All because he probably dump some water on the bouncer which isn't really right but he shouldn't of escalated it because now he's probably not going to only get criminal charges but he lost his job over something really stupid not to mention ruin the business reputation permanently and no one's gonna probably go back and I'm one of those people not coming back!    Old review 3 stars: I've been here two years ago during the week and I found this place is very laid-back and fancy but pretty expensive! You have to pay to go in a very small pool and if you go on a weekend it's $20 to get in and then another 20 to get in the pool area also you have to rent a towel and you can't bring your own which find very stupid! The day I went with my girlfriend me and her each got two drinks and just for the two drinks alone cost us $25 and it barely had any alcohol in it but fortunately enough the girl who served as the day was pretty nice! I would come back again in the summer but more than likely i'm probably just going to go drinking and dancing and not bother using the pool it's not really worth it and also they should probably lower the prices for some drinks and some of the food items as well it's a nice place but too pricey!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Ditch Friday. It was a burning hot day, just perfect for swimming and tanning.  The upside: - Stunning view of the city & chill vibes.  - We basically had the pool to ourselves. Most of the people there were not planning on swimming, just drinking in a bikini with full-faced makeup in high heels. - Good music and lots of dancing - Free Beck taxis from and to Union Station (we didn't take this, but it was nice that they had it)  The downside: - Early closure (by 9pm) - We were watched by lurkers and several creepy older men who came right in your personal space.  - Some of the people there were completely wasted (couldn't even stand up)- why didn't the bartenders cut them off? Gross. - There is this $20 towel rental, where you have to put a deposit to rent a towel. - Mixed service, but staff were generally friendly.  Overall, it's a beautiful venue and it was fun. I wouldn't mind revisiting. I'd recommend coming here at least once to see it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars.   It all began when we pulled up to the place. I could immediately tell it was a trashy-trying-to-be-classy situation. We walked in anyways. My friends and I are from the states and only two of us had exchanged our money. When we went to pay the 20 CAD cover, they gave the girl $20 USD expecting change (usually in Canada this happens with US money- I've never had an experience where it hasn't) instead, the girl said \"20 for 20\" and gave my friends no change, even though they owed them about $5.  When we walked in, I noticed that, despite the all white furniture, the place was so dirty. Uninhabited tables were left uncleaned. We tried to order a drink and we were told we needed a table to do that. So we sat down, waited about 25 minutes, and a waiter never came. So we went to order drinks again and they were literally miniature. And so overpriced with almost no alcohol added. I couldn't even taste it. We hung out for a little while longer and then realized that doing anything else was better than spending time at Cabana.   Don't go unless you're looking for a trashy crowd and shitty everything else."}
{"text":"The bouncers seem like they are from the middle ages. They spit in the face and tried to break the arm of my friend because he accidentally squirted two drops of water on  them from water guns that were supplied by cabana pool bar. Later we found out the bouncer was just trying to act cool in front of a girl he was into. I would never ever go here again. The owner/manager should be ashamed for hiring bouncers that act more like neanderthals than human beings. This is Canada 2014, not the middle ages from two centuries ago. Shame!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Cabana Pool Bar before going and was stoked to finally go for a friends birthday! I went on a saturday and the weather was sick (although there was chance of shower, it wasn't raining yet, not even cloudy). Cover was $20 which was reasonable but then there was an extra $20 fee for the pool, which compared to their tues-friday (no cover and $15 pool entrance fee) is not worth it.   The place had a beautiful view and very nicely decorated. It was pretty empty for a saturday but maybe cause there was chances of rain. The staff was mostly hot girls haha, but weren't all that friendly. We ordered a hookah, which was huge and for only $35.    Overall, their attempt at making a miami style pool bar in Toronto was pretty good! It wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be, but I had a good time. I think everyone craving a vacation in hot miami or vegas should try this place. They should definitely get a hot tub too!"}
{"text":"Cool for events where the entire space is rented out, but I wouldn't want to attend on a regular day, especially on a weekend based on other reviews I've read. Bucket drinks are worth the price and the view is killer."}
{"text":"I organized a Bachelorette party last Saturday for a group of 10 girls. We reserved a cabana and the girls in the office were very friendly and helpful with all of my questions about purchasing the table. They told us to arrive between noon and 2:30. We got there around 1:30 and none of the staff seemed ready for the day. I think we were one of the first groups there which was fine. We purchased a table to a pool party and it didn't include access to the pool which I found pretty odd. They brought us out food and didn't include any utensils or plates. The scene was ok but a very young crowd. Overall it was a beautiful day our waitress was friendly once we all got settled. I recommend it for an event like a bachelor or bachelorette party but wouldn't go back unless it was for a special occasion. The level of service seemed to fit the demographic they are trying to appeal to."}
{"text":"This place is apparently very strict on dress code. This is one of the biggest pool parties I've gone to but not the best pool party. The pool is actually pretty small in comparison to the table service areas.I still think Vegas parties take the cake but in terms of having a view along the waterfront to go with it, Toronto is up there. Very beautiful women that work here and it was cool to see a guy play the saxophone to some EDM music. I would definitely come back to party next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's a different experience in Toronto. Even if you don't want to use the pool, you can enjoy the view and weather and relax for a bit. Interesting vibe and decoration. They are usually very busy on weekends but it's fun"}
{"text":"I came here for a corporate event on a Friday morning and was disappointed to find out that it was raining. Fortunately they were able to adapt and serve lunch and drinks indoors as well as bringing in a ping pong table for us to mess around with as we waited for the rain to die down.  Afterwards we went to the driving range and played some mini putt, both of which were a fun time. We followed this up with some beach volleyball and the rest of our day was spent lounging and having drinks by the pool.  My only complaint is that some of the bartenders were not very attentive, perhaps because we were using drink tickets and they didnt expect us to tip.  Overall a fun experience despite the rain and some less than enthusiastic bartenders."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know what's with all the bad reviews.  Yes it's pretentious and yes there are a lot of fake people, but it's what you make of it.  Maybe it's because I went early on a Sunday and left before the crowd was reallllyyyyy drunk/god knows what else (left around 7:30pm) but my daytime chill session was great.  Earlier in the day the waitresses are nicer, you get ample seating, and $20 cover makes up for itself considering there's free pool and jitone tables.  The drink prices are comparable to other clubs, and their shisha is worth it if you just want to sit and chill.  At least it's not $50...."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday at around 430 pm and it wasn't too busy nor too empty (just right). Cover was 20 dollars per person and included entry to the pool as well (bonus for showing up on a Saturday).   The crowd and music was very lively. Beautiful scenery especially at sunset (both people and the location). See my posted pictures. The place had pool tables,  a ping pong table and lots of seating space. The washrooms were well kept and the girls one apparently even had beds. If you forget your swimwear you can buy it there but the price tag is steep at $60.  We had no problem just showing up and getting a booth (without buying a package). I came with about 8 friends and we bought some food and 2 bottles (750ml) which came with 2 chase each. The bill at the end came upto around 550 after taxes and tip. This isn't bad considering it was split 8 ways. Drinks otherwise are $9 which I expected.  Cons: Service was ok. The place closes sorta early which is a shame at 9pm.  Overall it was a good chill experience and I would go back again with friends."}
{"text":"The view of this place is everything. It's very beautiful, especially if you want to take some great photos. However, it would be hard to say that the food was as great as the view, but it wasn't bad. It was just normal. Typical place for hanging out with some friends."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews of Cabana from all different kinds of people, ranging from being really nice to bro-tastic. Now that I finally went for myself I have to say, not only is it beautiful and fun, but the snacks are delicious. It sounds like a weird thing to compliment, but I think their catering is done by O&B or something. The drinks are a little expensive but shit, if you have a hunger, the chicken wrap was INSANELY GOOD. Also, the $20 cover for the pool is kind of steep but hey it's summer in Toronto, it's only here for a couple months, so live it up."}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this uber expensive Miami wannabe club, but that quickly resolved after experiencing it for myself. To be fair, where else in Toronto can you find this kind of vibe? The waterfront view by itself gets 5 stars. A sunny day, good music, good looking people, a pool that happened to be free with general admission today and Hookah! what else do you need to have a good time? It's true that you have to spend over a grand to reserve a cabana and it costs even more for bottle service, but if you come here to dance , you don't need all those extras anyway. There are numerous bachelorette parties taking here, which is a great idea in my opinion. The staff are all nice and helpful. We wanted to get Hookah, but we were told that we can't have it by the bar, because of the regulations, but all the tables were also taken. Our waitress agreed that we can put it on the wooden spot next to the bar though. Each event is a different price. HedKandi was only $20. Hookah is $35 and the drinks are not cheap either. Parking is $20, so plan to park on the street for free and come early. The washrooms are quite spacious and clean. There are also lockers and changerooms. Beware that the pool is small and it's best enjoyed if you want to float on the floats, and not for swimming. Overall, Cabana's vibe is sure to boost your mood. Bring sunblock and enjoy the bounty of sunlight in style."}
{"text":"Great place to on the weekends. Cover for entry and pool access of $20 can be high. Drinks were reasonable at around $8-12. The waitresses and servers are our cabana were great. Kept coming every couple of minutes to refill our drinks, give us towels, and to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Cabana is a unique experience in the city of Toronto. Nothing else is quite like it (Muzik does not compare).   Entry fee is $20 then an additional $20 for pool access. The female washrooms have a touch up station (hair and makeup), there is locker and towel rentals and several bars on the premises. The venue itself it's beautiful, the views are gorgeous and there is always a great crowd.   Cabana's downside is service is horrendous. Waited 45 minutes for a waitress and another 30 minutes for a sangria pitcher and chicken wrap. The worst part of my most recent visit is when the waitress told us a $5 tip on a $35 bill wasn't enough. She claimed she would have to pay out of pocket unless we gave her more. I am always a generous tipper but when service is below average asking your customers for more money just isn't appropriate. Maybe management should look into more training for their staff.  Despite the incident Cabana is the place to be on Sundays and I certainly will be back before the season is over."}
{"text":"BEST CABANA POOL BAR YET!   Amazing views, beautiful people, pool, tons of lounging areas, and very chill house music.  //ATMOSPHERE// When I went, it was a beautiful sunny hot day so some people were in the pool, others shuffling and swaying to the chill house music, and people were generally very chill.   //THINGS TO DO// Lounging near the pool (you have to have VIP bracelets though) but swimming in the shallow pool is open to all.  The day that I went had a Greek theme so there was Grecian costumes, dancers, free corona flash tattoos & flower crowns given out   The indoor & outdoor areas were open so you can walk around or lounge around in many places. The were also foozball & pingpong tables outside !  The ladies washroom was clean & brightly lit. Plentiful with mirrors, stalls, sinks/counters, seating areas AND had a makeup/hair stylist there for touch up!   //$$// Cover was free if you get in before a certain time depending on the day. Didn't like that the drinks were very expensive & mostly watered down (very typical..). Food their was by Oliver & bonacini so it was pricey but good bar food. There was also a bubble waffle ice cream stand ($10/bubble waffle ice cream) so I thought that was neat they had that! T"}
{"text":"This ultra wanna be high mile end pool bar is just plain ridiculousness! A lot of guidos/guidettes and the Jersey Shore crowd. Except men and ladies think they really have to prove themselves to maintain their level of cool factor. The staff make sure you have a good time if you are VIP status by reserving a cabana/table. We came here for a wedding wknd celebration party, courtesy of family and friends. Rounds of drinks, appetizers, and hookahs in addition to music all afternoon. Honestly, not sure why the  need for all the pretentious and snotty vibe when it is nowhere comparable to the luxury pool clubs & resorts of NYC. For starters, they need a real bathroom not a trailer park size bathroom at the back of the club with security or next door concert bldg premise.   The space itself is huge except it is completely floored and overcrowded with tables. They need to take cues from real interior designers who actually know how to simplify and make the place really pop. The ultra white clean look might attract its crowd but they need to offer a lot more to keep this pool bar running. On the bright side, the pool bar/club faces the pier so expect to see a lot of rich girls with their daddy's yachts sailing.  Overall it was ok but not something to venture again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday with a friend. We registered for the guest list and we're happy to get in for free all access. We decided to order some food but the service wasn't as great as we expected. Took about 30 minutes to get someone to take our order. The upside, food is very good fairly priced. This is a great spot for great music and big groups"}
{"text":"kinda tucked away  awesome pool  awesome big screen  awesome pool tables/ping pong awesome bodies everywhere and speaking of everywhere...#&$%ing white EVERYWHERE *the design of the place*  no clue how much anything is so far as drinks and such the only downfall is if the wind goes the wrong way, all you smell is the lake"}
