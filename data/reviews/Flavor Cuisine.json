{"text":"Great taste and good price , i like the house special vermicelli in soup. Other items are good too. Cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Probably the worst spot in the entire food court. Been here twice and both times proved to be disappointing. This time was so bad it made me make an account and write a yelp review.  First of all, the lady at the front works at an incredibly slow pace. Be prepared to wait 5 minutes when you're at the FRONT of the line to even put your order in.   As for my most recent experience, people behind me got their orders first, even though they were behind me and they ordered the exact same thing!! I had to wait 50 minutes for my order! If this place served decent food then maybe I would of been fine but I had to go and could not of eaten it even if I wanted to. I asked for a refund 40 minutes in and the person at the front would not give it to me. Saying it'll only take \"one second\" while in reality it took another 10 minutes while the people behind me got theirs 20 minutes earlier! The person at the front was being rude the entire time I was asking for a refund saying \"but it's almost done\" in a mocking tone. Neither an apology nor compensation for their mistake.  When I did get my food it was unevenly heated and incredibly bland. Waste of time and money, do yourself a favour and don't even think of visiting this terrible place. There are plenty of other places you can go to within a 10 second walk away from there."}
{"text":"$2.50 pork chops that are similar to cutlet pork chops (the Chinese term for an almost panko breading on a deep fried pork chop).  They changed owners about three months ago. Some things are better now (the deep fried fish with corn sauce, although the batter on the fish isn't as light as I'm used to), but some things are odd. The curry chicken is chunks of battered chicken, not just straight up chunks of chicken, and their sweet and sour pork doesn't look like sweet and sour pork. Their green beans with minced pork and preserved veggie is absolutely delicious. I could eat bowls of rice with this dish alone, and I usually eat about two spoons of rice in a given meal (not a fan of rice unless I have something to shovel it down with).   Party Trays: They can turn the majority of the items on their menus into party trays. Two sizes. The first feeds (as in makes them full) about 6-7? Maybe a bit more depending on the people. The second feeds about 15-20? Their fried rices and their fried noodles/vermicellis/hor funs, etc. in party tray form are a great party option because they're so ridiculously cheap! The smaller one isn't as good of a deal, but the larger one costs about $34-38? Something like that. And they pack them full of whatever rice/noodle option you chose. I fed 35 people, majority teenagers two of these trays, had leftovers, and it cost me under $100 including tax."}
{"text":"Chinese food court Decent for something quick and cheap. Got the spaghetti and meat sauce for $7.35 tax in. Came with soup and soy drink. Everything tasted decent. Portions were good and filling."}
{"text":"If you are all about quantity, this is the place for you. The menu here is very extensive. I think they have well over 100 dishes to choose from. I opted for Chicken and Black bean sauce over rice noodles. For $6.50 you get a huge portion of food, soup and an iced tea. The price can't be beat, but it was heavy on the noodles and light on the chicken and veggies.  I requested no MSG and extra spicy. It was good, not outstanding. For a quick lunch, it is great. You actually can make 2 lunches out of it!"}
{"text":"portions are large.. price is cheap... thats all i'll give them.  if you are litterally on some sort of crazy binge for food and you dont care about quality.. then you hit jackpot.. you may want to also check out kitchen 68 few stores down.. portions are gigantic.. the bowl of noodles is almost 2-3 times the noodle the other places give.  i never finish it."}
