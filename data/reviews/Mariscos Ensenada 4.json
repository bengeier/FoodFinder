{"text":"I would give this place a negative score if possible. My wife and I came here and experienced sheer racism. Despite the fact that we arrived and were seated roughly 15 minutes before anyone else (i.e., the place was empty when we arrived) and ordered two carne asada burritos; we were served after a family of eight, who ordered a variety of seafood dishes. Moreover, our waiter never (literally not once) came to refill our drinks and I had to walk to the take-out counter to get the check so that we could pay and leave.  Needless to say, I haven't been back since. It's amazing how a place like this can stay in business."}
{"text":"Prices at this place are a hit and miss:  the ceviche (which is quite good, but probably would've been better had it been served with sour cream), is a quite reasonable deal if bought as a \"tostada\"; bought as an appetizer, it really doesn't compare price-wise.  The main courses are reasonably priced.  Interestingly enough, if you read the reviews for the restaurant's 16th St. location and compare them to the ones here, you will notice a trend:  at the 16th St. location, most people are okay with the prices; but not here.  I think this has a lot more to do with disposable income and a lot less with the prices themselves (apparently, people in downtown PHX are used to paying more and, apparently, have more money to do so).

Portions are reasonable, too, though it's a hit and miss:  the refried beans mixed with tomato sauce -- which is something I've never seen in a Mexican restaurant -- is very good and reminds me of the beans I used to have as a kid with frankfurters (not refried, though).  The \"garlic\" fish is not garlicky and has more of a lemon-butter taste to it.  The fish stuffed with crab is good and well worth the price; however, if you're not a fan of hollandaise sauce, this might be a bit too much for you (the sauce isn't hollandaise, but the consistency of it more-or-less is).

Fountain drinks would be preferable, but the prices for canned soda are OK.  While our waitress was friendly, attentive and overall tolerant of my poor Spanish (practice makes perfect :-), there were times I had to call to her or go to the counter to ask for something.  This isn't a reflection of \"racism\" as a certain reviewer on here alluded to (and who no doubt screams the accusation anytime someone doesn't bow and scrape before him and his wife out of shame for a way of life that ended almost 200 years ago and has nothing to do with most people these days), but simply that the world doesn't revolve around one person all the time and people sometimes get distracted (in other words, stop looking for unearned privileges and grow up!).

All in all, okay and good food; but would I drive another 20 minutes to come back here again?  Probably not.  Just not special enough to warrant the effort."}
{"text":"I frequent this place when I am craving fish and shrimp tacos while I'm at work. They always start you with fresh tortilla chips and mild/medium salsa. The lunch specials are ridiculously cheap and the portions are HUGE! I typically get the 3 tacos (2 fish and 1 shrimp) with rice and beans lunch special for $5 when I stop in on my lunch break. The fish tacos are my favorite and are cooked to perfection. The shrimp tacos are also a great choice but can sometimes have to much breading on them. Staff is very friendly and service is quick. The language spoken in this restaurant is primarily Spanish and if you do not know any Spanish it can be challenging to get you wants and needs met here depending on how well your waitress can speak English. Be patient! The lunch specials are worth it!"}

As others have pointed out, the prices are high compared to other places (in the range of $13-$16 for seafood cocktails) but the flavors were very good, and all the seafood was tender. I ordered the coctel de mixto (shrimp & octopus) and my girlfriend had the abalone cocktail, along with one shrimp and one fish taco we both shared. Both tacos were delivered hot, tasty, and dressed simply with shredded cabbage, although the waitress brought over a bottle of homemade chipotle mayo that went awesomely with the fried seafood. Only downside: the tip of the squeeze bottle was not big enough to allow the bits of cilantro through, which made dispensing the condiment a challenge.

The abalone was wonderfully tender and had that fresh-from-the-sea smell to it. My octopus was tender, as were the shrimp. The previous reviewer's comment about the shrimp not being deveined must have struck a chord with management because mine were.

This place is in the same shopping mall as the Ranch Market, and the seafood does seem to be of very good, fresh quality. However, sodas are by the can, which can be problematic if you're thirsty. Our bill was just over $40 with two seafood cocktails, two sodas, and two tacos -- not a cheap date out by any means. But for what you're getting -- fresh tasting, authentic-style baja seafood -- it beats handily the headaches of traveling to Mexico these days."}
{"text":"I stop by and it was a nice place but the prices are a little too high, I ordered the shrimp ceviche and it was the blend with no flavor whatsoever, I don't think I'm coming back. ALTATAS restaurant is the place to go avoid this poor imitation restaurant."}
{"text":"Hood place. Service was a little slow which is odd for lunchtime crowd of maybe 3 customers. Still, great food and nice ambiance. Got the feel I was in certain parta of Mexico so pretty authentic on the ambiance. Had the Campachena. Fantastic! Will come again!"}
{"text":"I love shrimp cocktail as long as the shrimp are de-veined. This place did not and I was unable to finish my $14 cocktail."}
{"text":"My first experience at this location was HORRIBLE\" when I was told 'Service Denied\" due to my Service Dog! 6-2-18 7p.m.   Personally I wouldn't rate this place but app won't let me post unless I rate."}

{"text":"I go to the little ceacers pizza on 59th and Thomas and I always see their sign for chicken wings for 6.50$ you get 10 wings and I got to say they are pretty good also for the price vs lil ceacers pizza 6$ for only 8 little wings these wings are good in size and well worth the price of 6.50$"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple girls from work who frequent this restaurant. I must say, this place is better than it looks. It is a sort of nondescript store front in a strip mall in Maryvale. I had the 3 taco lunch special for 5$, which was a good price because the tacos were huge. The salsa they give you is a good medium spicy salsa. I got a chicken, a beef, and a fish taco. The chicken was ok tasting, but was poor quality chicken (I probably shouldn't have ordered that here), the beef was good, but greasy. It was shredded beef that had some cabbage and cheese on it. The fish was the best one, but it still wasn't amazing. It was fried fish with a lot of breading, but the cabbage and salsa on it was good. I wish they used grilled fish versus the fried. The service was fine, but was very slow making it a hard place to go on a work lunch. Anyway, I wouldn't rush out to eat here, but I wouldn't say absolutely not either....3 stars."}
