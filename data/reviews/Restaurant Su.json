They have the best kunefe of Montréal but it is a pity that they don't serve it for brunch and even for dinners it is not always on the menu. Very good atmosphere and one of the best service."}

{"text":"Had an exquisite dinner at this Turkish fine dinning restaurant.

We shared 4 mezzes. All of them were spectacular. The garlic yogurt with spinach and herbs was outstanding. They were accompanied by various freshly made house-baked breads that were excellent.
We tried the beef stuffed pasta, the lamb kebab and the Cornish hens for the mains.  The lamb kebabs were by far the best of the 3 dishes.  The lamb was tender and aromatic. The other two dishes were very good but not as flavorful as the entrées.

We were too stuffed to try any of the desserts.

The decor is simple and traditional.   The service was perfect.  The waiters worked as a well oiled team and all of them were always on the lookout to make sure the customers didn't need anything.

I also appreciated how all the plates are served (by multiple waiters) simultaneously at a table so everyone can start eating at the same time.

All and all a very enjoyable dinning experience that I will certainly repeat and recommend."}

{"text":"I expected a \"Traditional Turkish Breakfast\" but it wasn't one. The portions were ridiculously small and unfortunately, the waiter wasn't responsive to our problems. To be fair, we went right after they started re-offering their brunch so there still might have been some kinks to figure out. But still, unfortunately, overall it was kind of  disappointing..."}

Le brunch complet inclus: oeufs (au choix), pain maison, salade de feta, concombres et tomates, olives, kaymak et miel, assortiment de noix, confitures maison, boreks, tartinade de noisette. Prix plus que raisonnable. Incroyablement bon et diversifié. Un must à votre agenda du samedi et dimanche!"}

Au menu, il y a des mezes disponibles en format petit et grand. Il est également possible de choisir un plateau selon les choix du chef qui s'ajuste en fonction du nombre de personne autour de la table. 
*Le mardi, ce plateau de 5 meze pour 2 personnes est à 26$ inclus un verre de vin par personne. Un bon deal!

Pour ce qui est des plats principaux, ils commencent à 19$. 

La cuisine est simple, mais tellement savoureuses, bien assaisonnée et bien épicée (pas dans le sens piquant, mais dans le sens goûteux). 

Je me suis régalée!"}
{"text":"Under my expectations. It's was OK but for all the good things I heard, it was a little disappointing. Waiter made a big thing and presentation for something that was ordinary. Portion of jam, olives, peanut and other stuff we can find in any groceries. Fish was good and tasty, price were OK. Lilttle pretencious for what it is, according to my taste. There is plenty of places where I'd go before this place, where food is.more tasty and special."}

Celles que l'on se prépare pour le BBQ après les avoir fait marinées quelques heures sont meilleures.  Mais la cerise sur le sunday : après avoir mentionné notre déception quant à la qualité de la viande, on nous a quand même chargé 4 $ pour une corbeille de pain !!!  180 $ pour deux pour tout cela - on n'a pas eu l'impression d'en avoir pour notre argent.  Nous pensions y organiser une fête pour le 75e anniversaire de mon conjoint, avec tous nos amis.  Nous continuerons à magasiner un resto.  Dommage."}
{"text":"Yummy, and possibly the best service we've ever had in Montreal!

We came to Su last Friday on a whim and are so glad that we did! Upon entering, the ambiance is very relaxed with awesome traditional geometric prints on the walls, and blue accents on the furniture. We were immediately greeted by our amazing waiter (wish I asked for his name because he really was the reason this is getting 5 stars!!) who quickly told us that he had a hunch that we were familiar with food from the region which we gladly confirmed. He explained a little bit of the menu and then came back a while later to take our order.

An in-house bread basket came out with 3 different types of bread, all of which were super delicious. Our Turkish sangria came next and was very refreshing. We ordered the red pepper dip and the red lentil/bulgur patties to start and they were very good (although the bulgur were TO DIE FOR). Next came the main dishes. Hubby had the lamb shank which was falling off the bone, and I had the aphrodisiac chicken which was phenomenal. Although we were stuffed, we had to go for a dessert, and so we opted for the sesame chocolate cake. I'm pretty sure it's one of the best and most creative desserts I've ever had. I'd go back just for that, and I don't exactly have a sweet tooth so that's telling you something.

The food was spot on, the service was impeccable, and the entire experience was amazing. I can't wait to be back!! 

ps. Just as a sidenote..two appetizers ended up being too much for us because their portion sizes are quite generous, so if you're planning on dessert, I'd go for one appetizer :)"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner time without reservation and we were lucky that the restaurant wasn't too crowded. 
The general ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and the staff was really nice right away. 
But let's focus on what we're here for... the food! ;) It was simply delicious! The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because my boyfriend ordered veal liver and it was a little over cooked ( but really, just a little!). The waiter apologized and said that we could and should have said something, they would have replaced the meat right away... other than that everything was really really good! 
I would definitely recommend that place and I will for sure go back there to try the other dishes and also try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful meal!  Came here for my Dad's 80th birthday.  We were not disappointed.  Everything was delicious.  But the absolute standouts were the mushroom/fungi with goat cheese, the lentil and bulgher cakes; and the mumhamarra!  And service was wonderful."}
{"text":"My review is closer to a 3 1/2.,
it's above A-OK but below Yay! I'm a fan

This is one of these restaurants that is a darling of the food literati in this town, I believe that it happens with ethnic restaurants when the chef can speak English or French with ease and when it's upscale enough that food snobs don't feel that they're eating somewhere beneath them. 

It loses points for it's location (I know it's close for some, but not for all). 
It also loses points for the waiter yelling at me from across the room not to sit at a particular table. 

The food is very good, but the portions are small and the price are a bit too high.

We had the 5 Mezze platter ($30) which includes  2 small dolma, 2 bulgur kibbe, a small side of calamari and 2 different garlicky yogurt. 

For mains, we had the Su Kebab ($26), which was very tasty, but does not come with a side dish, it's cut up and draped on a thin loaf of bread, accompanied by a drizzle of sauces.

We also had the aphrodisiac chicken dish ($23), a small quarter chicken, nicely done with rice and dried fruit.

We had to fill out on bread just to feel a bit full.

The desserts are in the $10 range, very overpriced as the portions are tiny.

With 2 drinks, the total came to $140 before tip, so this is definitely on the pricey side.

Authentic Turkish does not have to be expensive, the decor is modern Mediterranean, but minimalist. I would only bring somebody who does not want to slum it a the low key kebab places.

J'ai pris le petit déjeuner complet avec les deux ufs, sucuk. Je n'ai pas particulièrement aimé le sucuk, mais c'est une question de goût personnel et non pas de qualité de l'aliment. Il faut dire que je ne connais pas vraiment la cuisine turque, alors tout était nouveau pour moi. Le reste était absolument délicieux.

Je vais certainement y retourner pour goûter au menu du soir."}
{"text":"Du toc !
La cuisine de ce restaurant est très décevante étant donné la richesse de la cuisine turque.

Plats insipides et sans grande saveur. Une planche composée de 5 entrées comportait une petite quantité de yogourt à l'ail, seule entrée savoureuse, un petit d'amas de bulgur sans grande saveur, une \"salade\" de betterave en cubes sans assaisonnement, une purée de gourganes sans saveur, deux petits tronçons de courgette et d'aubergine de bonne facture. Ce qui fait le plus mal c'est le prix de 30$ pour cette planche pour deux...
Étant amateurs d'agneau, c'était la place toute désignée pour en déguster. Le jarret d'agneau sur un lit de cassoulet à la turque était de l'agneau de Nouvelle Zélande !!! La cuisson trop rapide n'est pas venu à bout des fibres coriaces des petits muscles. Les haricots blancs manquaient de cuisson pour avoir ce moelleux tant réconfortant. L'autre plat était du Su kebab. Il consistait en un morceau de gigot bien mariné et grillé sur le grill.  La qualité inférieure de la viande nous faisait découvrir des vaisseaux et autres nervures peu appétissantes de cette viande. La viande était savoureuse grâce à la marinade. Elle était couchée sur du riz basmati sans histoires et quelques champignons.

L'addition prenait tout son sens de douloureuse avec un total de 180$ pour deux avec une bouteille de vin turc (moyen), taxes et pourboire inclus.

Non, je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Had a very positive brunch experience at Su! I would highly recommend it.

- The service was very friendly and attentive 
- The food was excellent and flavourful - it was great value for the brunch menu which is $17 and includes a delicious variety of spreads, cheese and olives with warm bread to begin, with the main entree - has vegetarian and meat options  
- The space has a great laid back and welcoming vibe - loved the ambiance and decor  

I would most definitely encourage anyone who hasn't been here for brunch to try it out."}
{"text":"When I visited 5 years ago, they had real Turkish dishes in regular portion with mid range price,  But my last visit was a total disaster, as I wanted my friend to have the experience of a descent Turkish Cuisine. The menu has been changed in a way that all portions are minuscule and overly priced. I ordered Doner Kebab, what I know it as beef or lamb meat layered on a rotating horizontal pole and cut in small pieces as they cook. Portions normally contains pita bread, rice, depending on a restaurant, some garnitures and fresh vegetables. I was told by the waiter beforehand that their version does not have any rice. Ok..at least I am getting the meat. What I received was a steak of lamb cooked rare and cut into cubes placed on a rock hard tiny pita bread. Waiter later came by and asked how everything is and I responded, \"I am not so happy with my dish, this isn't Doner Kebab that I know of\". His defensive response appalled me even more. He said \"The menu is evolved over time and this is a deluxe version of Doner Kebab\". He wouldn't stop. I said \"Well this is my opinion\" and cut it short. I paid a bill of 90 dollars plus tip  for their attentiveness and left never to return again. 

My final word is that if you would like to experience Turkish Cusine, this isn't the place anymore. It is overpriced for the quality in both the food and the look and location of the premise, and it is deceptive for who had been here before or who like to have the experience of the Turkish food."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Turkish restaurant. Great experience. We went there on a sunday around 1pm. They close at 3pm. I was surprised they only offered the brunch menu with fixed price, 16.50$. We decided to order different plates so we could all share together. Overall, the food was great but the portion was not what I've expected. I had a casserole 2 mirrors eggs with lamb sausages. I dont know if that's how the sausages should taste but the taste was way too strong. The place was quite big, lots of tables. They offered lunch and dinner as well. Might come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went back again for #MtlaTable brunch this year and took my whole family to try it because I loved it so much last time! I now rate it 3.5* and here's why: last year, we had one wooden board of mezzes for 2, unlimited bread, and each a savoury main option (the meat filled borek and the sujuk & baked egg - both delicious). 

This year, and  to my disappointment, they had run out of the ricotta omelette option, so I opted for the baked eggs with veggies in a skillet. Good but not as flavourful as the sujuk skillet. I also tried the vegetarian borek, the lamb meatballs and the potato & chicken plates. The chicken was cheap in portion and kind of bland, the meatballs in an oily sauce was also on the bland side... the borek and the baked eggs were the best options. 

They only brought us 2 baskets of bread and 2 wooden planks, as if we were 4 people, but we were paying for 5. The fact that we were charged for the 3rd basket of bread shouldn't even be a thing (it's not about the cost, but rather the principle). 

Also, I don't know if it's because they are catering to the Canadian clientele but I don't understand why they serve food that's on the bland side since Turkish food is anything but! The black tea, once again, was too perfumed and weak.

All this to say, if you've never tried it, then it's a unique experience with yummy food and the quantity-price ratio is worth it if you're an even number of people but I don't think I would go back for a third time."}
{"text":"I am in charge of choosing restaurants for work. I don't remember how I found this place but I am glad I did. We ordered the discover menu and the food kept coming.

{"text":"Loin,loin,loin.cadre simple,mais très agréable,service très prévenant\"carte de vins amusante et désordonnée.pas de table d'hôte.cuisine exceptionnelle qui vaut très certainement le voyage...les portions pourraient peut être un peu plus généreuses.le prix est justifié par une cuisine de grande qualité,mais devrait être plus bas étant donné l'emplacement."}
{"text":"I love Turkish food and, having lived in Turkey for a long time, can be pretty picky. So believe me when i tell you Su is worth going to. It may not be classic Turkish cuisine but it is clearly inspired by it and it is delicious.

The restaurant has a fresh and modern feel. The staff are friendly and attentive. The wine list is interesting, with many Turkish wines included. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and most tables seemed to linger for hours, as did we. 

The best part, in my opinion, was the happy coincidence of going on a Wednesday because Wednesdays they have a special deal on their tasting menu. For only $31 dollars you get the chef's choice of 4 mezes (appetizers), 3 meat courses (we had cornish hen, monkfish and lamb), and 2 desserts. This is accompanied by their freshly made bread and olive oil. It was a really interesting mix of dishes and gave us a good feel for what this restaurant had to offer. Some of the dishes were good. Some were very good. One or two of the mezes were excellent.

I will definitely go back to this restaurant, probably on a Wednesday, and i look forward to tasting more of Su's dishes."}
{"text":"Situé sur la rue Wellington, le Restaurant Su est l'un des rares restaurants de fine cuisine turque à Montréal. Plusieurs fois applaudi par la critique, le Restaurant Su propose une variété intéressante de plats traditionnels turcs. On retrouve de nombreux tapas en entrée comme une purée de gourgane ou des betteraves braisées. En matière de plats principaux, la chef Fisun Ercan nous concocte un jarret d'agneau braisé aux herbes, des brochettes de lapin marinés, ou encore un filet de saumon frais. En dessert, on nous sert des desserts originaux tels que la crème de figues ou un soufflé à la crème de sésame. En plus de sa délicieuse cuisine, le restaurant Su dispose d'une belle salle à manger et d'une généreuse carte des vins."}
{"text":"Lors de mon inscription sur Yelp, je me suis promis d'écrire sur ce restaurant situé dans l'arrondissement Verdun.  Le nouveau Mile End, comme certains se plaisent à nommer l'endroit, cache de véritables trésors.  Su fait résolument partis de ces joyaux de la couronne verdunoise.

Nous étions une dizaine de personnes à table et tous, sans exception, avons adorées notre expérience.  Que de bons mots pour les entrées, les plats et les desserts savoureux, préparés et présentés avec soin, qui nous ont été servis au courant de la soirée.  Que dire du service qui est, à mon avis, hors du commun. 

Pour l'entrée, je vous recommande la totale, soit le plateau-surprise (Meze Tabagi).  Vous aurez un bon aperçu de ce que la maison peut vous offrir de meilleur.   
Quant au repas principal, je vous suggère fortement les pâtes maison farçies (Manti) et le Kebab Su (fait avec de l'agneau du Québec). Aux dires de mes convives, la cuisse de lapin braisée et le demi-poulet de Cornouaille ne sont pas piqué des vers.  

En ce qui concerne la carte des vins, elle présente une grande sélection de produits en importation privée, notamment en provenance de Turquie.  Malheureusement, je n'arrive plus à me souvenir du produit que nous avions sélectionné. Un vin turc qui nous a grandement surpris.  Une recommandation de notre très sympathique serveur.  

Bref, pour une expérience gastronomique hors du commun, que vous soyez un membre en règle de la confrérie des Foodies ou pas, le restaurant Su est un passage obligé.  Si la vie vous intéresse..."}
{"text":"Nourriture: tres bon, savoureux, recherché et bien presenté. Pain maison delicieux, belle carte des vins et la sangria turc est juste wow! Un bemol, les portions trop petites. Surtout du menu decouverte pour deux, on avait encore faim apres. Pour les desserts, ca m'a decu, car j'adore les desserts turcs et ils pourrait offrir mieux.

Service et decor: excellent, plus que parfait. Accueillant, chaleureux, propre, beaux....rapide mais pas stressé! 

Prix: portion, prix des produits brut vs quantité, ca marche pas. Tu peux pas charger aussi cher pour du poulet et du riz avec des petits legumes grillés? Serieusement? Ou ben augmente au moins les portions? 

Est-ce que j'y retournerais? Oui, mais je prendrais un plat a moi seule et je me preparais un bon budget!"}

I also ate the manti, just melt in your mouth goodness! Definitely another must go in Verdun."}

J'ai trouvé que l'on était chiche sur les quantités versus le prix et je dois spécifier que mon amie et moi avions pris un menu découverte pour deux.  Grosse déception côté dessert, je n'ai pas aimé (fondu au cacao et granité).  Mais, je n'hésiterai pas à y retourner pour tester le reste du menu et découvrir un peu plus de la cuisine turque."}
{"text":"Connaissez--vous la cuisine turque? Probablement non. Tout comme son histoire, celle--ci est riche et variée, mariant les influences de l'Europe et du Moyen--Orient. 

Su est un restaurant turc haut de gamme ; tout est préparé avec soin et perfection. 
La décoration est simple et raffinée à la fois, avec beaucoup de céramiques du pays et une utilisation du turquoise qui rappelle parfois la Grèce, ce pays voisin. 

En entrée, je vous suggère fortement de partager une assiette de meze, ces bouchées apéritives. Ils sont fantastiques! Tout est goûteux et frais, beaucoup de légumes, de fines herbes et de yogourt. Mon coup de coeur: la purée de topinambours citronnée et le cacik, yogourt crémeux aromatisé aux fines herbes. Le tout est accompagné de pain frais maison et d'huile d'olives. Magnifique! À boire avec un vin turc (moi, un rosé).

Si vous n'avez qu'un plat principal à choisir, n'hésitez pas à essayer les mantis, de mini--raviolis au boeuf fait à la main servis avec une sauce au yogourt et aux tomates pimentées. À l'origine, ces raviolis étaient préparés par les futures mariées en offrande à leur belle--mère. Plus les pâtes étaient petites, plus la mariée était douée pour les travaux manuels, activités importantes à l'époque. On jugeait donc les femmes selon leur habileté à créer ces pâtes! Ce n'est plus le cas aujourd'hui, mais on peut encore apprécier l'énorme travail que cela représente et les savourer un à la fois. 

Je n'ai pas goûté aux desserts, mais j'ai pris une tisane à la menthe, bien rafraîchissante et digestive à la fin du repas. 

Le restaurant n'ouvre que le soir, du mardi au samedi. Une réservation est fortement recommandée, surtout les vendredis et samedis. Une expérience gourmande qui vous fera voyager dans votre tête. Et qui sait, peut--être aurez--vous l'envie de vous envoler vers ce pays fascinant?"}
{"text":"For someone that has travelled to Turkey more than a few times, I have been dying to find a good authentic Turkish restaurant. I have been on may sites, reading many reviews and finally decided that SU might be the place I have been looking for. Just a quick lesson: in Turkish SU means water!

So I live in Laval and this place is in Verdun, so mot your next door restaurant, I reserved a Friday at 6:30, and had to leave at 5:30 in order to make it, due to the lovely traffic and construction Montreal has.

Situated on a nice street, walking in was an inviting place with some turkish decor, lights are dim and a very open modern space. We sat down immediately and  the waiter came to gives our menus, he asked if this was our first time here and we said yes, so we went through the menu with us, gave us some suggestions and answered all our questions. Then gave a bit of time to choose, now that is what I call a good waiter his name was Fréderik by the way.

For appetizers we ordered yogurt and cucumber mix, turkish phyllo dough with feta cheese and calamaris. The calamaris were very good it came with some yogurt on the side on a bed of greens, cucumber, diced tomatoes and radish 10/10
Yogurt was yummy a bit like tsaziki but not as thick and instead of dill it had mint. 10/10
The phyllo I didn't like, it wasn't but bad just mot my taste 7/10

Now for the main food we ordered Su kebab, diced lamb on top of some rice, veggies, caramelized onions with yogurt and ketchup sauce. It was honestly succulent, maybe a little spicy for my liking but it tasted to good and it was just a back thought.

The other main dish was chicken plate, this plate was sooooo delicious, it was pieces of chicken on top of this savoury combination of veggies kinda like a ratatouille wish was on top of a home made thick grilled pita. With yogurt and hummus sauce. Words cannot express how fantastic this plate was. It was a burst of magical flavours each time you took a bite. 20/10

Our meal was complimented with Turkish Sangria, a must try and finished off with Turkish coffee, mint tea and Turkish Baklava. 

Food was amazing, fresh, price is affordable, staff is well trained, knowledgable and courteous.

I will bring my family and friend to this place"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant.  We ordered the chef surprise- 5 tapa sizes side dishes they choose.  All 5 were terrific.  We followed this with a dish of eggplant stuffed with lamb. We had to wait 20 minutes but it was worth it.   Including a bottle of wine, tip and tax our bill came to $109 C.The service and atmosphere were first class."}
{"text":"On Easter I went here for brunch with a friend. The starter plate (consisting of delicious bread and various spreads) was phenomenal. I also ordered an omelet which was good but not spectacular. However, the ambiance, service, and efficient was spectacular. The food was Turkish but was slightly altered for Canadian foodies. Nonetheless, SU was a great eat and I recommend going for brunch. Prices were around $25 for a full meal with no alcoholic drinks. Fun Fact: Su means water in Turkish!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out for brunch with some friends. Easy to find and easy to park because it is tucked out in Verdun. The place was very nice and the presentation was good, but nothing was crazy good. I enjoyed the creativity of the options and the way it was presented. The service was very good and over all a nice brunch experience. I had the \"pulled pork sandwich like\" option and it was good but very meaty for breakfast. I will go back again soon and try some more dishes to see if there is something else amazing I missed."}
{"text":"It's mtl a table week, but they refused to honor the menu on the tourism mtl site that they are part of."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place but found it about 20% more expensive than it should be. Turkish sangria was very good. The tapas style selections are great and could almost be a main in themselves. Very friendly staff knowledgable about the menu. Food was fantastic. 

Slightly lower prices, more options to do sample plates individually rather than as a group / whole table, the proper Turkish bread to go with the meal, and a terrace would make this a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"Portions are very very small in turkish we say 
( bununla kus bile doymaz) meaning? It's not even enough for little birdie or something like that :)
Owner is a nice lady she know turkish food very well no doubt about that but even the size of the main course are like appetizers I feel like Iam in a tapas bar where everything is delicious but soooooo little . When most of your customers are locals ( not turkish or Armenian from turkey or middle easterns etc) it's easy to satisfy them because most locals don't know how turkish food spouse  to be  served , they just come here like a tasting menu eat pay and go . And that's what the owner wants anyway. Finally I like to finish my review by saying something  to owner in Turkish

{"text":"I have noticed that there seems to be a huge problem in classifying, identifying and experiencing Middle Eastern food properly.

First off, there are huge regional differences and varieties in the food from the Middle East or the Levant. It's not all just \"Arab\" or \"Islamic\". Turkish, Afghani, Persian, Lebanese, Syrian and Moroccan all are very distinct cuisines, where the ingredients and spices they use are often a reflection of their geographic, cultural and historical reality.

Turkish food is not heavy on spices but places a huge emphasis on the freshness and quality of it's ingredients, where the natural flavours are allowed to shine through. Add a little bit of Greek, Roman, medieval Venetian, Persian and some Arab influences along with a verdant Mediterranean climate and you have one of the most overlooked cuisines in the world, which hopefully will change soon.

If you're not sure what to order here on a visit, for mezes, (appetizers/tapas) , try the Kirmizi biberli ezme, an extremely flavourful dish with pureed red peppers, walnut and herbs. Other uniquely Turkish dishes are the Yaprak Sarmai (stuffed vine leaves with berries) , Sucuk (spicy sausage) and the Kasar Pane (Shepherd's cheese from eastern Turkey). For mains, try the Karniyarik (meat stuffed aubergine) or Manti (ravioli pasta in a yogurt and garlic sauce).

I lived in Turkey for 3 years and miss some of the dishes there terribly, but at least coming here gives me a small taste of the true thing. While Su is great overall, they don't have much in the way of desserts and wish they offered some of their home grown classics like Tavuk Gösü, a chicken pudding based on \"blancmange\", a Medieval European pudding typically made with chicken, almonds and sugar which was a very popular sweetmeat in the medieval royal courts of Europe which the Ottomans picked up. Sounds gross, I know, but once you have it, you'll never forget it. The only place you can get it now is back in Turkey.

Another wonderful dessert which is absent here is Ekmek Kadayfi (almost drenched Bread pudding), smeared with kaymak, especially the fresh kind from Afyon. The cows are fed the remaining stalks of poppy plants, making them, um... very happy, which allows them to produce the thickest, freshest clotted cream you can imagine called kaymak.

I think I have to buy a ticket back to Turkey soon..."}

And it's not THAT far from downtown, so I highly recommend the detour if you're not in the area. The restaurant itself is beautiful and comfortable.

Most importantly, the food is simply amazing. Authentic flavors. Do yourself a flavor and take the Discovery menu. You'll get to sample many different things. Totally worth it. And their homemade breads are to die for. I especially like the chickpea flour one, but they're all great. You usually get a selection of 3 different breads.

The service is perfect; it is friendly and efficient. No complain in that department.

They have a good selection of private import wines, including many excellent Turkish wines. Might as well try one of them since you're in a Turkish restaurant!

A must to try in Montreal whether you're a local or a tourist."}
