{"text":"Central Pizza has been an institution in my family and the township for over 20 years. Current owners/operators are the best yet. Great pizza, better wings, and many other tasty items on the menu. 

It's more of a take-out or delivery pizza joint than a dine-in; I don't think I've seen a single thing change about the dining room in 23 years. Never once had bad service or bad food, though, and I can't recommend them enough for awesome pizza in the Elizabeth Township area.

I can't say a bigger compliment than the fact that as a kid, I learned my phone number first...and second was Central Pizza."}

{"text":"Grand Central has always been the best pizza in the area, this is there spinach pizza I've never had anything like it anywhere else it has ricotta cheese mozzarella cheese spinach and bacon!! There deluxe Italian hoagie has pepperoni salami ham and crumbled sausage! mozzarella lettuce tomato and a special hoagie sauce that is my favorite part!"}
{"text":"The Italian hoagies are delicious! Great prices and great food. The service has never disappointed. Will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Had a pan pizza for take out. It has a nice crisp crust with generous toppings. The sauce was tangy with consistent taste. Had breadsticks and the seasoning was nice as well as the marinara dipping sauce. I own a pizza shop and it is hard pressed to find a pan pizza and a descent one at that. The dough and toppings were consistent and well baked. The staff was nice and we left a tip. I have made pizzas since 1987 and don't eat it too much so there are only a few places I have found that have a truly good pie. They have a Sicilian as well that we will have to try. Thank you for having a good product and service!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian hoagies in the area. Never had a bad experience with them in over 15yrs I have getting food there."}
{"text":"Good Italian hoagie, fast delivery (20 min from order to door - excellent) 
Extra sauce very good (recommended)"}
{"text":"I was a walk in.  I was immediately greeted by a nice young man. The Italian hoagies I ordered were prepared quickly and were very tasty.

I'll try other menu items when I can.  If you are in the area I recommend that you stop in for a tasty munch"}
{"text":"The best Italian hoagies! The white sauce and the house vinaigrette mixed together makes the BEST dressing. I order my hoagies with the dressing on the side and dip my hoagie straight into it."}
{"text":"The only thing that tastes good is the Italian hoagie with sauce on the side, but not all the time. Sometimes it's such a greasy soggy mess that it's almost inedible. The last couple times we got pizza, it went right in the garbage. The worst pizza I ever tasted. It's a shame because they are good sometimes but it's always a conversation if we want to risk wasting our money to throw all the food in the trash."}
{"text":"LOVE the Italian hoagies - I don't know what that dressing is but it is addicting!"}
