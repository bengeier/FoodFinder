{"text":"We went here for the first time a few weeks ago with some friends. The restaurant ambiance was very nice, eccentric and modern. You would never think it when you see the restaurant from the outside. Their signage should be updated as it looks like a sign that you would see for a fast food Indian place. That aside, the food was good (not amazing, but good). I had their sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and it wasn't anything special compared to the Keg or other steakhouse restaurants. Maybe because i ordered mine well done, but the steak was ok..the mashed potatoes were a bit cold. Presentation was very nice though! My hubby had the stuffed chicken and he really liked it  but then again he's not as picky as I am. We had their appetizers..calamari and their cevape  platter and A+ for both! The cevape platter is a must try if you love your meat! Mini pork and beef sausages on a bed of fresh onions with yogurt dipping sauce. Perfection. 

Service was decent, however our waitress kept making mistakes. First she spilled olive oil on the table, which almost stained my brother in laws shirt. Then my husband asked for a spoon and fork for our dessert, but she gave him a steak knife and fork. And when we asked to split the bills (by couples), she did it individually. She was a bit \"slow\" if you know what I mean, but not in a way that ruined our night because poor girl seemed nervous and was trying. 

There was also supposed to be a live jazz band playing that night but no such thing. Maybe because it was a slow night, they didn't bring out their band but it was disappointing as we were hoping to have a little entertainment during our dinner.

Overall, I give it a 3.5 star because my meal didn't floor me (but the apps did), and because the waitress was a bit \"slow\" and there was no live entertainment as advertised. But it is a place I'd go back and try again."}
{"text":"Tried out TBG's Balkan Steakhouse and it seems like one of the top steakhouses in the Vaughan area. 

The meat was so soft it almost did not seem real, the homemade peppercorn sauce was done well and the presentation/plating while simple seemed to add some sort of intangible added value.

When I went they had the garage door to outside open and with the heaters outside it was actually more cold inside than it was outsides which was a major detraction from my experience. They eventually asked if we wanted it closed but we were already halfway done out meals by than. 

I will definitely be going back again in the future and I am glad that Savour York Region helped introduce me to one of the hidden gems of Woodbridge as it is hidden in a plaza opposite Vaughan Mills next to Marcelo's.

I ate off of the regular menu which was priced on par with some of better steakhouses in the GTA while my cousin got an amazing deal with his price fixe menu. 

I suggest trying it while you can get some value during Savour York Region week if you can make it otherwise those who will be in the area and have the extra time and money should give TBG's a try."}
{"text":"I went to TBG's, 'cause I prefer trying non-chain restaurants. I went in with high hopes ... Which were quickly dashed. 

I ordered a medium-well sirloin, I got a piece of cardboard. The steak was super well-done: this is a cardinal sin for a steakhouse. It your cooks can't distinguish between a medium-well and well done, you're in the wrong business. 

The one redeeming quality was their \"spicy devil sauce\" ... It was Hella good! It was the only way I could swallow the cardboard I was served. 

Also our waitress was cute and did try her best to remedy the problem with our mains ...so this place got the extra star. 

TL;DR: ordered medium-well, got served cardboard. Will try again, 'cause it's a non-chain. 3/10."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with this place. Went here in a group, and found the service terrible and the food unapologetically poor. 

Steak had decent flavour but was cold. Most people complained about cold food. 

Caesar salad was very fishy tasting, penne pasta was drowning in black pepper. Burgers tasteless and over cooked.  One of the chicken strips wasn't cooked properly. Any attempt to address with management  was met with an argument. 

Honestly don't know why some people spend hundreds of thousands opening restaurants, only to treat patrons like trash?

Overall, had a terrible evening. Will never go back to this place."}
