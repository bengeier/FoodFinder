{"text":"I had to put 1 star but this place deserves NONE!  I was very specific that I wanted crispy wings and shrimp and fries.  When they arrived the fries were greasy and soggy. The wings were not crispy at all and the shrimp were also greasy.  When I called and complained they were rude and I was told that all of the wings \"better\" be in there when they brought a new order and that I would then complain because they were too well done and that the fries were cooked the same way they always were....heaven forbid.  I will never patronize this place again... beware."}
{"text":"A lot on the menu to chose from. . and was super pleased that my hometown bread is featured for their hoagies \"Mancinis\" baby!    Yinz: hoagie, pie and pizza..   the recipes we pittsburgh'ers love..  fries on our salad and buffalo chicken!   
I tried the Yinz hoagie:  grilled chicken -special ranch sauce (hot sauce and ranch) prov cheese, let and tomato and onions.  It was good - no doubt different.  The pizza is good..  sauce has a little sweetness to it and very flavorful.  My lunch orders have been spot on with accuracy.   I am looking forward to ordering again..  \"wing dust\" wings .. what are they all about?!  Thanks Pizza Station"}
{"text":"I'm always happy to see a new place open up in the Valley, especially if the food is good. The chicken licker pizza is interesting to say the least. Pretty good tasting as well. Traditionally when getting pizza in Mon City, I tend to order from IVP exclusively, but this place makes a decent pie. Crust was a bit bready for my tastes, and it fell apart just a bit too easily, though. The breadsticks too are your run of the mill breadsticks. One thing I do enjoy though is their funnel cake, which is a dessert I'm very fond of, and they make it well, here. Overall, this place is pretty decent. I'll check in again soon and see how they go."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Best quality in the near downtown area.  It is up there with Fioris.  Friend recommended it and glad he did because this place is a highly underrated unknown gem.  Sauce tastes great and all around quality ingredients.   Fast crisp delivery.   Just a solid pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!! Hint of garlic in the crust! Hoagies are HUGE!! Reasonably priced and fast delivery. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"the food was fantastic !!! i ordered buff chic pizza omg !!! i love it !! will back soon!!"}
{"text":"First time we tried. We got the sicillan, breadsticks, small vegan pizza and chicken tenders. All of the food was wonderful. It tasted very good.

The place seemed backed up as they just opened recently. I like that it's close and will be another place I can get pizza from. They have a large menu.

I will be back. Recommend going here."}
{"text":"I've never actually taken the time out of my day to write a review about a place, but I feel like these reviews are so misleading that I need to share my experience. Probably the worst pizza in the valley, I would MUCH rather eat Detorres or IVP before I ordered another pizza from there. That being said the hoagie was really good and so were the fries but the pizza dough was clearly a frozen round dough (which is remarkably obvious) and mediocre tasting at best. Would not recommend their pizza to anyone with even slightly developed taste buds."}
{"text":"Well I've been waiting to try this place. Sadly it was a big let down. Pizza is a very subjective food.  For me... the crust was too thick, undercooked and was similar to a bread dough. Sauce was lacking flavor as was the cheese. Folks were nice enough but quite honestly the tase and quality were lacking."}
{"text":"This pizza is solid! Will be our go-to from now on. We ordered it for pick up and it was on time and the employees were friendly. Overall good pizza, not quite 5 stars but no complaints!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are absolutely in love with the food here! The pizza is probably the best in the valley. The breadsticks are delicious and smothered in garlic butter. I also tried a steak Hoagie which was delicious. I plan on trying the wings next. Only downfall is they have been insanely packed every time we have come here so far. The parking is an absolute disaster; there are not really any distinct parking spots so everyone treats it like a free-for-all. They have about 5 parking spots with 25 people trying to squeeze in them. When I tried to call in my order, the line was busy. Tried about 5 more times and it was busy every time. Absolutely chaotic when I drove down to order in person. Once inside, a few other people came in after me, saying the same thing- they couldn't get through on the phone. The older lady at the register was clearly frustrated and not very pleasant, but I can understand why. A really nice guy kept coming out to inform people of how much longer their orders would take. Even though it's pretty crazy here on popular nights of the week like Friday and Saturday, I won't ever let that stop me from ordering some awesome food, though"}
{"text":"Ordered once again and this time ordered delivery. We were told 45 minutes and it was about 50, which is acceptable to me taking into account time to actually place the order. We ordered a bbq steak calzone (no mushrooms,) a half dozen licker wings with extra side of sauce, and fried mushrooms. Everything was great, the calzone was like a lead weight it was so stuffed with filling. Definitely will order again. Licker wings are a new favorite of mine and I rarely order wings."}
