{"text":"Can't believe this place is not crowded on a Friday night. The food is always phenomenal. The garlic knots are off the chain and the service is always awesome. This is simply the best kept secret in Tega Cay. Those that think you can't find primo real Italian around here are crazy. Have a good Italian friend from NY who absolutely loves the place. Real deal happy mean."}
{"text":"Finally, tried their pizza.  Take-out...not the buffet.  Not the best dough recipe, but all toppings were fresh and delicious.  I recommend the bbq chicken pizza.  It makes up for the blandness in the dough.   I still love the entrees...always great.  I recently had the Tuscany Shrimp and it was perfect.    Overall, this is more of a pasta/entree place...not a pizza place.  If you haven't tried the entrees, give DeMarco's another shot.  If you want good, authentic pizza go to a place like Luigi's."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The stuffed smoked Salmon was great. We truly enjoyed every bite of it. Loved the Salmon Aurora."}
{"text":"Thought the food was absolutely delicious. The service is a little slow, but the food was awesome. Garlic Knots are great, I had classic lasagna and was great. Would recommend hands down."}
{"text":"Fantastic for years! Their spaghetti sauce is awesome, and get the balsamic on your salad.  great dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Management would not honor our $30 gift certificate which was received earlier in the day as part of a 'Welcome to Fort Mill' packet and had the owner's(?) signature, a serial # and no expiration date).    The entrees were good , but pricey."}
{"text":"I have been a server here for two years, the food is absolutely delicious, their bolognese sauce is definitely to die for, the alfredo sauce and marinara sauce are so good, garlic knots are so fluffy and their garlic butter is out of this world, I'm gonna miss eating this food everyday, if you are close to the fort mill are and wanna try out real Italian food this is the place to go. Always check on the specials. Also if you to dinner mon-thrus were its typically not so busy, you can ask him for any Italian dishes even if they are not on the menu, if he knows how to cook it and has the ingriendts its most likely that he will make it for you."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch on a first visit... empty parking lot was a clue. Inside the buffet beyond where the average pizza selections were displayed was too dim to easily distinguish what was being offered. Very embarrassed to have taken friends here WITHOUT checking it out first! Will never go back."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about working here, think twice. Most pay days come days late, unless the owner decides to pay you under the table which happens quite often. This is not a bar so ignore the mixed drinks menu. They have kids UNDER 21 throwing the alcohol together hoping they did it right. There is no manager and it's a free for all to any employees considering the owner is busy cooking during all shifts. The wife of the owner comes in occasionally but is mostly just in the way considering she doesn't work there or know how to actually help out. They lied saying they'd move me from hostess to server but just kept me as a back up the whole time. They have no respect for any employees and though I've never run a business myself, I'm telling you these people have no organization and are extremely hard to work for. Not worth the minimum wage you get after busting your ass and still getting treated shitty!"}
{"text":"I started eating here in either 2004 or 2005.  I always enjoyed their lunch buffet but due to my job I have only eaten lunch here twice this past year.  My husband and I went this week at 12:10.  There were only a few people and one partial pizza available in the buffet.  I was shocked to see that they were using fake frozen meatballs.  As a proud Italian I cannot begin to comprehend WHY any Italian restaurant would take this shortcut.  I asked the waitress and she verified where the meatballs came from.  I now consider myself an EX customer.  BTW -I have brought my family for dinner but found the prices too high for the quality Bucas is much more authentic not to mention a much better deal."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place as several people told me it was good. Maybe we went on an off night but it was Saturday and only 4 tables were occupied when we arrived. I heard good things about the Chicken Parmesan which I ordered but it was just ok. My husband had ravioli which was pretty good. Our server was nice enough but he walked past our table 4 times without saying a thing to us. Our food came out in a reasonable time but 7 minutes after we got our food he came with the check and asked me if I wanted a to go box as I was literally putting a bite in my mouth. I was a bit dumbfounded and told him, \"I'm still eating\". He wasn't rude, I think just not up on server etiquette. We may try this place again, maybe for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best surprises of my last trip out to Fort Mill.  I was visiting one of our properties and the staff recommended this place for lunch.  Since it was almost literally next door to the property, I figured I would give them a try.  I'm glad I did because the food was delicious and amazingly cheap.  I had the lasagna and it was so large I couldn't even finish it and ended up having to put some of it in the refrigerator for later.  Guess how much it cost?  Remember - this is homemade lasgna that tasted like it was freshly made that morning.  Ready to guess how much I paid?  $5.75!!  Yes, $5.75!!  In Atlanta the same thing would have been at least $9.00 if not more.  This is a top choice for delicious food at a good price.  Honestly, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"DeMarco's is OK... a little pricey for dinner.  Their pizza is TINY.  Their lunch buffet is a much better deal."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently ate here for dinner on a Wednesday night.   The good: 1. The garlic bread knots that were brought to the table with our drinks were very good.  It was hard to say \"no\" to a second basket. 2. The pizza I ordered was very good.  It wasn't too greasy and the toppings were fresh and plentiful. The bad: 1. It took 20 minutes for my wife's salad and my calamari appetizer to come out and there was no explanation given as to why.  When there's only 5 tables in the restaurant (and none had more than 4 diners), there's no reason it should take that long unless someone had to go catch the squid before they could make the calamari.  2. My wife's alfredo pasta was plentiful but the sauce needs more flavor.  It wasn't bad, just rather plain.  If you go, go for the pizza and the garlic knots and don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, friendly atmosphere. Big fan of their pizza. Lunch buffet is great, as it often has many options. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Wife ordered the cheese ravioli entree, came out with 6 ravioli, just enough to cover the bottom of the plate.  Chef got offended when asked about the portion size. Restaurant is good, chicken salad was good value. The ravioli plate was $12.99, Chicken Salad was $7.95."}
{"text":"Best Eggplant parm around - and the garlic knots are just so yummy!  It's our go-to place in Tega Cay for Italian food.  The service is as excellent as the food."}
{"text":"Very forgettable. Ordered the daily special, chicken caciattore which was horribly bland. Wife had a chicken pasta dish with pesto sauce. I love basil, but they over did it, and sometimes more is not better. It didn't help that the Ac wasn't working while we ate. The food, service, and atmosphere are all overrated and highly overpriced. Even Olive Garden beats this place. I would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in Tega Cay for 2 years now and we go here all. the. time. The food is always amazing. I see some bad reviews on service and I will admit they they must only hire pretty girls with no brains who are still in high school. (One time we asked for some parmesean cheese. She said \"Sure, no problem. And do you want some ummmm errrr shakey cheese too?\" ..... We all had to hold back our laughter... \"Yes dear, that would be parmesean.\") So service not the best. But we've never felt neglected or mistreated. They always are so nice so I try not to hold it against them that they are just young.  Their meatballs, chicken parmesean, marinara sauce, alfredo sauce, lobster ravioli, bolognese, everything we've tried has been great. AND GARLIC KNOTS TO DIE FOR (when they aren't overcooked. Very rare, but it happens - We usually just ask for a new batch).  I finally decided to write a review after this past weekend when we tried... FRIED CHEESECAKE. The sounds that were coming from our table were almost XXX rated. The most delicious thing I've ever had. anywhere.  These others with negative reviews must have just had a few bad experiences. We've been here probably 15-20 times and while service has been up and down, the food is always solid with minimal variations. We bring everyone here."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service! Never had any issues at all! Great for kids as well! Lunch buffet is cheap and good quality food"}
{"text":"so good. all the sauces are fresh made for every dish. the marinara sauce is the best ive ever had, and the balsamic dressing is amazing. cute little restaurant w/ a friendly staff and amazing food! if youre craving italian DeMarcos will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  Eggplant Parm was SALTY.  Veal Parm was tough and so thin.  Maybe 1/16 inch?  The breading was thicker than the veal.  At least the veal wasn't the pressed type.  Will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I would say it is a \"hole in the wall\" and that is typically a good sign.  I love their chicken parm, so don't seem to vary much from this dish.  Their bread knots are really good and I think their food and drink prices are fair.  The kids love their pizza and they typically have some really good specials.  This has become one of our favorite local spots."}
{"text":"We went from University City to Fort Mill on St. Patrick's day, to pick up a license plate for a car my wife bought in February. The kids were hungry, and we weren't into the whole St. Patrick's Day mood.   We hadn't had Italian food in a while, so I navigated to this place via Yelp on the iPhone. It's in a professional building, underneath a dentist's office, adjacent to a bunch of strip malls on Gold Hill Road.   We found it odd that it was cold in the restaurant, on what was otherwise a very warm March 17.  The waitress offered to let us sit outside, and so we did. Never mind the bird poop on the wrought iron table... Or the fact that the patio hadn't been swept in a while.   We were promptly served the highlight of the meal, a basket of probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted, complete with herbed butter. My boys demanded we get a second basket with our meal.   I'm always suspicious of Italian restaurants that don't have some decent coffee available. When asked, the waitress didn't even know if they did. \"That's okay, I'll drink water...\"   Oddly, some folks behind us were served great-smelling coffee about 20 minutes later. I wasn't offered, so I resisted ordering it.  My universal complaint about most mom and pop Italian restaurants from NY to FLA to CA  is that they don't seem to do salads much justice, and they charge too much for them when they're ordered a' la carte. This place was no exception.   We found it interesting that the salad Twin B received as an accompaniment to his meal had a nice array of romaine and other lettuces on it, along with croutons, while my wife and I had to endure the non-nutritional value of iceberg and a sparse sampling of veggies. Twin A had ordered a special salad to go with his pizza. It came with great olives and just a few more veggies.   I ordered a crab-stuffed sole, which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Twin A ordered a pizza. Twin B ordered a pasta dish with a heavy, herbed cream sauce and some tomatoes. My wife had grilled salmon and broccoli.   The first thing I noticed about my plate was that the fish and broccoli seemed to be drenched in butter. Now, I like a little butter now and then, but dammit, it's 2012, and most people now know that it's not a a healthy fat to coat a whole meal in. A big draw of Mediterranean food is its heart-healthy reliance on lean meats, fresh veggies, whole grains, and olive oil. So where did all that butter come from? I'm not used to Italian fish dishes or veggies being drenched in butter.  Anyway, the sole was okay. The crab stuffing was greasy and bland, The broccoli had no flavor beyond the butter, and the mashed, skin-on red potatoes were very, very good. Oddly, they were served with little or no added butter! I just dipped them in the ooze from the rest of the food.  Twin A loved his pizza, saying the cheese and olives were awesome, despite a limp, wet crust.  Twin B did not like the heavy, herbed cream sauce that came on his penne. I tried it and found it to have an odd, chemical taste, and to be so heavily laden with fat that I could see why he was disappointed He could probably feel his arteries seizing up after just a few bites.  My wife said the Salmon was just okay. There was nothing special about it. Her broccoli did look like it had less butter on it than mine.  The damage was $69 and change with tip, no alcohol. Entrees are generally in the $13 to $18 range, with pastas not far behind. Pizzas are a little less.  Overall, the experience was \"Meh\" for the salads and entrees, \"Yay!\" for the garlic knots, pizza, and mashed potatoes. We have definitely had better Italian food for less money in many other places. I'd probably take my son's advice and order the pizza if I were you."}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night. Good food and great service. We had Baked lasagna and the shrimp appetizer, very good. We plan to return."}
{"text":"I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \"welcome\" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed. Staff was slow and unresponsive. Pizza seemed old and stale. Poorly lit for lighting and wasn't a restaurant that has something others don't already have. Reminded me of a bad CiCi's style pizza."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! You can never go wrong with anything on the menu, and the servers are so friendly. We get Clippers Magazine, and there are always coupons in there. my husband's dad is Italian, and I cannot wait to bring my in laws to check this place out, as they are pretty particular about any Italian food. Salads are actually with greens, not the crappy iceberg that seems to be the norm now. The Garlic knots are so addictive, it isn't funny.  The also do not overcook vegetables , which is HUGE for me. We live in Rock Hill, but do not mind driving a little ways to this place....totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had chicken Marsala - sauce & mushrooms perfect. Son had meat lovers pizza - he gave thumbs up. Daughter had kids chicken Alfredo , perfect size for 9 yr old. Husband ordered calzone  - yummy but took 30 minutes. Service was ok, waiters need some more training. Unfortunately there is a lot of construction on Gold Hill Rd , I think it is effecting their numbers. It was Friday night & there were very few people there. The food is excellent & well priced. We will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Buffet is decent. Nothing exceptional"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a few coworkers because they have a reasonable lunch buffet.  Unfortunately the food falls flat for me.   On the buffet is a rinky dink salad bar that  looks like everything was prepackaged.   No real flavors to the dressing except mayonnaise.    The Italian items on the buffet consisted of spaghetti, italian sausage, penne with vodka sauce, pasta with some sort of butter sauce, stuffed pizza dough with pepperoni or spinach, small garlic knots, various types of pizza and some dessert type thing.  All in all, it's a lot of dough, carbs and no real flavor.  Nothing that was really good for you except for maybe that generic salad.     Service wise, it looked like a husband/wife team and it wasn't that great.  Drinks went left unfilled.  And check out was handled at the bar and it was a slooooooooowwwwwwww process.  It took us 10 minutes just to get through that.  I've heard the dinners might be better here but cheap or not, the buffet wasn't worth the gas to get down here."}
