{"text":"Bit of an odd process to ordering but worth it for the momos. 

Ordered 10 beef steamed, 10 beef fried, and 10 veg steamed (suggested by the owner). We also ordered one paratha. Wanted the potato balls but they were out. 

Everything was delicious. We liked the steamed more than fried. I particularly enjoyed the flavour of the veg. Watch out for the hot sauce. Totally delicious but as a fan of spice even I was reaching for water. Paratha was a miss - not much filling and seemed quite doughy. 

Everything came to $24 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed and that's not easy for me considering this is primarily a take-out restaurant. First impression was terrible, this restaurant has a very small menu to begin with so when I was informed that their fryer was down and that they did not carry vegtable or fried beef momos I was not pleased. The worst part of all is that I had an upset  stomach after consuming merely 4 steamed momos."}
{"text":"I eat here every week. They have the best momos I ever had, and the hot sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Their food is good and always fresh. The owner is very welcoming and hospitable. The place is usually busy - lot of takeout orders. We usually dine-in because momos are best when served hot with a cup of sweet tea and some hot sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty and fresh. Menu is limited but what they do is wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing beef momos!!! At about $7 for a box of 10 momos, it's a very good lunch option. I usually am never able to finish them all in one setting because they're very filling. The momos are delicious and the hot sauce adds a nice touch to the meal. Loved the fried mashed potatoes as well. Loga has the best smile, he has such a warm and welcoming presence. A real Parkdale treat!"}
{"text":"After neglecting the need for dinner for way too long, we stumbled upon this place and decided to check it out. We shared an order of 10 beef dumplings between us, for $6!

Hint: order from the little take-out place to the right, then take your order outside, and go into the place on the left if you want to eat there. You can get drinks on the left, and they'll give you cutlery. 

Dumplings were delicious, hot sauce was extremely hot, and the price was right! We're told they also have chicken dumplings, lamb dumplings and vegetarian potato dumplings, but those you might have to wait for them to make. 

Ten wasn't quite enough for the two of us to share, but probably would have been too much to eat solo. Looking forward to trying the other kinds!"}
{"text":"Yo, Loga's Corner has some seriously delicious hot sauce(s)! I make a homemade hot sauce and I'm so sad that it's nowhere near as good as theirs. I was however, happy to hear one of the owners passionately list the ingredients that go into their hot sauce. I want the exact recipe you use!!

Their momos are great for take out but I can't wait to get them home, so I place an order to eat there and another to eat at home.

I'll have to come back for the Paranda 'cause people thought it was cool to buy every last one of them!  

Super nice people work here! I don't get why they're so nice. Don't they know I'm at home studying their sauce trying to replicate it?

Skip the ketchup. Don't skip the ketchup. It doesn't matter. Enjoy your momos, mofos!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. The owner is so friendly, even offered to walk us to our car when I was confused about parking! haha 
Delicious momos, delicious beef noodle soup, love the hot sauce. $7 for 10 dumplings. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"When i went here i didnt have the greatest feelikg but thought i'd give it a shot. Turns out it is pretty good and i would surely go back. 

Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding, killer momos, been having their momos at local farmers market, now in this little resto... i can't say enough about the fantastic, simple, delicious momos and a very reasonable price... MUST go if you haven't, you will not be disappointed... just wish they were open late nite, would be a fantastic to pop in late..."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Get the beef Momo with hot sauce, ask for soy sauce for the full experience"}
{"text":"Simply excellent, great price for portion size on momos, for 6 dollars you get 10 or 12 momos, and a really hot but good hot sauce that really adds more flavor to the momos. Not for the light-mouthed! Their parathas are absolutely out of this world, excellent buttery snacks stuffed with potato and onion, and their potato balls are a nice snack but they're a bit too oily. I recommend you get their momos with yogurt and the hot sauce on top. Good business, good owners, very good prices. I hope we can get more choices in the future."}
{"text":"This is a serious Momo spot. Go before they realize the food is about 2/3rds the price that it ought to be. The owners are very charming,  and you will want them to succeed, so you will be glad to pay the equilibrium price when it is reached. Momos juicy as heck!"}
{"text":"Best momos!! We had the potato, veggie and chicken momos DELICIOUS. Cant wait to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, decent prices, great quality food.

I've been going to this venue for years now, and I still regularly take my friends there. They accept debit or cash, and the momos are always fresh, warm-to-hot. I am also always greeted with a warm welcome when I arrive, and consistency as to the communication on what is available upon ordering has improved since my original review, so I've been getting nothing but a 5-star experience at this venue the past numerous times I've visited it. I would (and indeed do) highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Never having tried Tibetan food before, I took the opportunity on my trip to Toronto to try it out. 

Searching on Yelp, I came across Loga's Corner. It's situated on a side street in a nondescript house. It was late afternoon on a Saturday and the place wasn't busy at all. 

I ordered up front from whom I suspect is the owner of the shop. I got an order of beef momos, and was told that I could find a table and sit. He brought me the food within five minutes. It was a platter of hot, steaming dumplings. I added some hot sauce the dumplings, not realizing how hot it was. I felt my tongue numbing...

These momos remind me of a Chinese dumpling, but with a thicker skin and the beef has quite a meaty flavour. 

Personally, I'm not a biggest fan of the flavour, but I can see how most people would enjoy it. Nevertheless, with the friendly service of the owner and the great price, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best momos I've had in Toronto. Meat is very flavourful and momos are so juicy and delicious. The hot sauce is really spicy but goes so well with the momos. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Tibetan takeout place in Parkdale, as they offer fresh hot steaming momos real quick.

When you walk up to the no-nonsense counter, you are greeted with a smile, and you can order your momos.  My go to is the steamed beef momos for $7.  This comes with a hot sauce that can get you sweating if you use too much so apply with care.

They also have buttered tea and fried versions of the momos.  Seems quite busy as I see lots of people coming in and chatting all hours of the day."}
{"text":"I am frankly not a fan of momos or dumplings, but their momos conquered me! I tried beef and chicken options, both are delicious. Each momo is perfectly molded, contains decent amount of meat and small portion of liquid broth inside. These components all together creates delicious composition of tastes in one bite. Love it! Will be back again many many times."}
{"text":"Very excited to give Loga's Corner my first Yelp review! Loga is a very kind man and he remembers every customer who walks into the door. I've been here now for two years and he always greets me with a smile and a handshake. I always order the fried or steamed momos, and they never disappoint. The food is comforting, cheap and is made fresh every single day!"}
{"text":"Jumbo momos. All of us had their steamed beef momos. It was cheap and you get ten of them bad boys. Definitely worth the price. The dining area feels like a living room convert, but it doesn't matter you come here for the food anyways. 

Super friendly service. The owner was all like 'goodbye handsome' as we were leaving. Thanks."}
{"text":"I was only able to try the steamed beef momos today, but they were excellent in taste & value.  A true comfort food that hit the spot for myself, my wife, and son (2.5 yo boy).  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Closest place for me to go get momos, fried or steamed. Reasonably priced and usually always comes ready prepared hot, juicy (burned my tongue lol) and fresh. I believe the person taking cash is the owner who is friendly. It's been open for a while now and I can see why. Good atmosphere to grab food and chill out."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, cheap momos served late. And I love the hot sauce here."}
{"text":"Yummy beef momos and great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years and was glad to know it was still around and still offering affordable Momos. I ordered food to go and they already had their Momos prepared in take out containers so there was zero wait. Great spot for take out. 

Their selection has definitely become smaller, and they had run out of the vegetable Momos so I got the potato Momos which were very tasty. Of course I asked for their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Another one of those: \"I expected way more cuz  famous people came here.\"

It was A-OK. I kept finding chewy bits in my beef which was quite unpleasant cuz I had to spit them out.  Otherwise, you get ten juicy momos for $7.  Yes, the $6 days are over.  The main photo needs to be replaced since I felt somewhat misled.  

Service was good though.  Gotta love service with a smile.  I'd give an extra star for that."}
{"text":"These momos are SO good. I have only tried the beef, chicken, and mushroom ones but they are all fantastic, especially the beef. The owner is the sweetest guy too. Definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Momo. I am always pleased by the amazing price and the amazing taste. 7 dollars + tax for a full belly of STRONG BEEF MOMO?! Bring it on!"}
{"text":"A great place to go for a quick snack or a small meal. The momos here are terrific, and they come with a really good hot sauce. Be careful because the hot sauce is pretty spicy. You can also get the momos frozen to make at home.

The staff are very friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Tasty and generous service from Loga.

I believe all the momos (dumplings) can be served steamed or fried. Strongly recommend getting the beef as the flavour stands out much more than the other choices. Hot sauce is also delicious!!

Tip: they don't serve water so just ask Loga and he'll hook you up with something to drink.

A hole in the wall, meant more for takeout. We had their potato ball and it was also delicious.

Expect about $7 per set of about 10-12 momos"}
{"text":"Best momo's ever I have tasted in Canada. Very authentic taste and price is really good. It's a family owned restaurant, very friendly and respectful service. Whenever I am in that area, I always go here. I love this place."}
{"text":"So good! They not only sell you momos (and have a lot ready so it's quick) but also they have frozen ones so you can bring them home and eat them when you need your momo fix and aren't near Parkdale. 
The family that works there are SO sweet though, and it's worth the trek. The momos are delicious and the lassi is good, too. It's a sweet, nofrills kinda spoty and it's great."}
{"text":"Talk about hidden gem.. I guess this won`t be hidden much longer as it was recently in an episode of Huang`s World.

I love dumplings.  I keep a pack of frozen ones handy at all times.  But this was my first foray into Momos.  The dough is a bit thicker than Chinese pot-stickers. The boiled variety are as juicy as heck and as I took my first bite I sprayed someone across from me in the eye.

I`m not sure what that hotsauce was, but that alone was worth the trip out here.  

As everyone has already noted, owners are friendly as heck.  I need to make it back here a couple of more times before this place blows up with hipsters with lines around the corner and where they can easily charge double the price."}
{"text":"Had beef steamed momo. One of the best. Will definitely go there again
Price is reasonable too. Small place but good food."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favourite place in Parkdale. I trek there weekly to go and snag their signature momos and potato dumplings. Great customer service, and unreal hot sauce. 

Not to mention it's super reasonable, and super quick!"}
{"text":"After reading about this place in BlogTO, I decided to give it a go. The owners are super friendly...the momos were even better! It's best to order ahead if you don't want to wait for the specialty dumplings but the beef ones come out fast. For $6, you get 10 pretty big dumplings... you can't get better than that. Great new addition to Parkdale!"}
{"text":"its all about the beef momos(steamed) my friends,also got the chicken and the deep fried beef,they were alright but daaaaaaayum the regular beef ones??mad dangerous for the waistline!!! mad cheap too!you get 10 pcs for 7 bones! one aerving is usually enough but if youre a big bag of dirt like me,get 3! the hot sauce made me suffer the next day though,but its not worse than taco bell dayafter disaster(whats worse than dayafter taco bell belly cramps anyway?) would recommend! loga and his crew are badass mothers..come here,enjoy yoself and give that man loga a fist bump! #parkdalelife"}
{"text":"The rating is actually a 3.5 star rating. I'm in between A-OK and Yay!, I'm a fan.

I found out about Loga's Corner after watching a recent episode of Huang's World featuring Toronto. Parkdale is home to many Tibetans and is also known as Little Tibet in Toronto. With that being said many Tibetan restaurants and mom and pop shops have opened in Parkdale including Loga's Corner which is located in the heart of Parkdale. Loga's Corner is a mom and pops restaurant that specializes in Momos which is essentially a Tibetan dumpling that comes steamed or deep fried.

We came on a Saturday afternoon and ordered 10 steamed beef momos ($7 tax included) and 10 beef deep fried momos ($8 tax included). You place your order in the front and seat yourself and when the order is ready, they bring the food to your table. Tibetans dumplings are different than your traditional Chinese dumplings, the skin is a lot thicker, a more heavier seasoning and a musky taste but in a very good way. The steamed momos were okay but the deep fried momos were fantastic, perfectly fried and when you bite into it, the juices explode into your mouth. The accompanying hot sauce was also very delicious.

When we were there on a recent Saturday afternoon it wasn't too busy but they do seem to do a lot of takeout business. The place was pretty clean and the staff and owner are really friendly. I definitely recommend Loga's Corner if you want to try traditional Tibetan dumplings and the prices are dirt cheap, the prices on the chalkboard include tax."}
{"text":"Loga has expanded the menu to include parathas and beef noodle soup.  Both are good and both are $6 like the momo's.  In terms of price it's still a very good deal.  The 1 less star is because even though it's very convenient that the momo's are ready (like a fast food joint, great if you're hungry), I'd prefer to wait to get freshly made ones.  And that doesn't happen very often anymore.  
I still like the veggie momo's and my son still loves the beef ones. We like them steamed, if you order them fried, it will be fried fresh. But the switch from fresh to fast food, made me take a star away."}
{"text":"I did read the online reviews before choosing to come here.  It's a small place I believe out of an old house.  It's not fancy but then again, the best places food wise is not fancy. lol.  

You have to order at the counter and they you can bring it to your table.  There's lots of tables to choose from.  It's family owned and it felt like some of the family members were there when we came.

The food was good and hot.  And it came out fast as I believe all the momo's were previously prepared and they just steam it / fry it when it's ordered.   The steamed ones may had already been prepared as we got this handed to us right away with little wait.  The fried ones were really good and crispy.  I would definitely order fried again.

The price was great for the amount of food that you get.  

The person at the counter which I'm guessing is the owner is really nice and friendly.  

It was quiet when we got there but while we were eating. This HUGE group of people came in. I guess they operated a running event that meets up there.  Anyways there was people standing all around us.  A bit awkward while we were eating.  But they didn't stay too long as they were just grouping up here to go on their run."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a really good experience here, and it lived up to the reviews.

The service is excellent -- the owner is such a nice guy and you can tell he puts his heart and soul into it. He double checked with us to ensure our order was accurate and he was very courteous.

The prices are pretty good. The fact they have tax included already makes it even better, especially as they are all whole numbers. My friend and I had 4 rounds of momo (2 fried, 2 steamed) and 4 cans of iced tea and paid $34 total which is decent for what you get.

The taste was very good, both steamed and fried. I liked the chicken and beef the most, while the veggie I could take or leave. The fillings overall had some nice taste and a very pleasant overall array of herbs used. Steamed, it has a nice soft feel and is quite enjoyable. Fried gives it a great crisp and solid change in flavour, but it takes ages for it to cool down haha.

Each momo is a good size, so I feel its worth the money. It could be a bit cheaper perhaps, but overall it was solid.

Be careful of the hot sauce... it's not for the faint of heart!"}
{"text":"Cute little place tucked on a side street off Queen St just east of Lansdowne, Loga's Corner is is home to a small chalkboard menu of affordably priced Tibetan snacks. 
The main item here seems to be the momo's, which are somewhere between a dumpling and a pierogi. An order of 10 rings in at only $6-$7, and you can order them steamed or fried.

We opted for an order of the veggie and chicken momo's, both fried. They were pretty tasty, although would say that that they actually tasted better when taking a piece of the chicken and a piece of the veggie and eating them together, than they did individually on their own. They also came with a hot sauce but the sauce is more just plain spicy than actually flavourful. 
The mango lassi, which is basically a mango and yogurt milkshake of sorts, was pretty refreshing as a beverage option for a day as warm as the one we stopped in. 

I could see this place being a better destination for a lunch or mid afternoon snack than a dinner, but bonus points for being open late (10:30 on a Sunday, for example) for later snack needs as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for affordable momos in Parkdale, Loga's Corner got you covered. This little gem in offers variety of momos but their beef Momo is the best of the bunch. I even asked if they sell frozen Momo in bulk so that I can eat delicious inexpensive momos at the comfort of my house. Place is not fancy but their food won't disappoint you for sure."}
{"text":"To start with, we are momo lovers and by now have tried several restaurants offering momos. We have been here for more than 3 times now and tried veggie steamed and fried momos. That is all he has for veggie lovers. Ambience is not extraordinary. You will find cheapest price momos here, also around this location among the others. The hot sauce is really HOT. Ask for the radish pickle on the side, its delicious. Star deducted for uncleanliness and serving in paper plates and plastic cutlery."}
{"text":"Love this place. On a little side street in Parkdale. Very cheap and good food. Their potatoe balls are really good also.  Try this place if you are in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to live right next to this place. I can see into the restaurant from one of my Windows. . .  I avoided it for the first year I lived here as a typical white Canadian that is ignorant of exotic food, it's hard to walk in for the first time when you are unaware of the food and the culture... However the experience couldn't be more simplistic and minimalist. The place has a very friendly,  warm and welcoming vibe you would expect from a Buddhist venue. . .  The man behind the counter is so nice and friendly.  And the food, well as a vegan I have found my guilty pleasure / fast food in a jungle of bad quality / high salt/sugar Canadian food. . .  I get the veggie momos, they are absolutely delicious and incredibly filling. Amazing value!  As others have put it, one of Parkdales hidden gems. Go here and spend a tiny bit of money,  keep them in business for their local fans you will NOT be dissapointed no matter what your taste in cuisine.  Cheers :)"}
{"text":"Loga's corner is part of a cluster of Tibetan restaurants over at the western half of West Queen Street, Parkdale. And probably the most casual of them all. There's no posted hours of business that I could find to begin with. I have seen the place open in the afternoon and early evening, if that helps.

It is generally a takeout place, with an area for eating in inside and out, generally composed of a literal scrapping of tables and chairs. To best describe the setting, it's like stepping into a college friend's new apartment and said friend got a few furniture off of garage sales and Craigslist to stock the place. Simple to say the least.

Maybe the 'college friend' analogy does not cut it. Loga's feels less like a restaurant in the conventional sense of the word, and more like a hippie stoner guy's apartment down the hall who leaves his door open, allows people to walk in whenever and he'll cook something for them. That seems more like the vibe, maybe without the dope. It is so casual, the guy steps out at times to hang out with his friends--and you wonder if he is the only one manning the place.

The food is dope though. Loga's Corner has a brief menu, primarily focusing on the Tibetan momo: a kind of Chinese style dumpling with flavour influences that are more Indian, like cumin. There are beef momos, fried beef, potato and lamb momos, among others. When we inquire about what a particular item was, the answer we got was the proprietor (I'd assume he is) running to the kitchen and returning quickly with a sample to try. That's the best way to describe a food, hands down.

As much as the super-relaxed humourously-casual atmosphere goes, the guy is super-friendly to boot, and genuinely wants you to be happy here. Food-wise, delicious when fresh--and imma sucker for dumplings. There's great flavours of onions and cumin, and a bit of spicy heat, with the hot sauce served with it adding a hellofalot more. $6-8 gets you a plateful of about 10 momos--10 to 15 is sufficient to fill a single stomach with a meal's worth. I suppose as per other reviewers, you can call in an order beforehand, 'cuz it takes a while for them to be ready.

{"text":"Hard not to like and appreciate this spot.
Owner was very friendly, helpful (1st time).  He appears quite fond of Matty Matheson and Eddie Huang (how I heard of it), mentioned Matty has a very good heart..  nice establishment!
The Momo's were great, I prefer the Fried (part of my problem!), Beef and chicken excellent, I don't care for the vegetable.  Potato balls also good. Fair prices.

Oh and the hot sauce, amazing!"}
{"text":"All of the stars are belong to Loga's. If you have not had momo ever, it is the best variant of the stuffed little dough pouch idea. Like ravioli or pierogi only more stuffed with more delicious. So friggin' cheap, it's not fair. I tip a dollar per order so I don't feel like I'm ripping him off."}
{"text":"Super cool owner, great food, loved the butter tea, especially during this ice storm. So soothing and hearty at the same time. 

Will definitely be back when it warms up and I can ride 15km to this place!"}
{"text":"Beef momos are much better than the chicken ones. Chicken momos had wrappers that were too thick and fillings that were a bit small.

Love the hot sauce and the friendly owner!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are so wild about this place. I've been to Nepal and Tibet and the momos here are muddy tasting and not balanced too much onion in the chicken momos. Veg ones had no flavor. My dog wouldn't eat them and he's a street dog who loves to rifle through garbage."}
{"text":"Really nondescript tiny restaurant located next to a school that I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't actively looking for it. The owner (I think?) was out front having a smoke break but immediately followed us in the moment he saw us and was extremely helpful and friendly. We got an order of the steamed beef momos and chicken momos to go. Everything was stacked in takeout containers, so we were out the door in minutes. 

Each order comes with around 10-12 dumplings, piping hot wrapped in tin foil inside the styrofoam box. The doughy wrapper of the dumpling is on the thicker side, but it goes well with the amount of stuffing in each one. The filling itself is well seasoned and flavorful, but kinda dry which is where the hot sauce steps in to add moisture. Unfortunately, the hot sauce was too spicy for me, but would have gone really well with the dumplings if I could have stood the spice. Also ordered the butter tea, which is something completely new for me. It looks like tea, but tastes like super-rich savory chicken soup. That is the closest comparison I could think of to describe the unique taste. Definitely will be back to try the other dumplings choices."}
{"text":"I have had better!!
It's a small restaurant with an even smaller menu. You get a lot of what wrt what you pay. I tried their chicken momos, were alright! 
Might go back to try their beef momos and when I go back this time it will be their last shot."}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap and Traditional Momos. Do the beef ones steamed, you cant go wrong. Feels like the Hill Stations in india. Lassi was legit too ! Owner was genuinely friendly.  majaedar ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food, the ambience, and the owner made the whole experience all-around amazing! We got the veggie fried momo's, the steamed vegetable momo's , and the fried potato balls. We ate the food with the spicy sauce; as a warning to those who don't like spicy food: do not dip the momo's with the  sauce - super duper spicy!!! But even though my mouth was burning by the time we finished our food, it was totally worth it! The spicy sauce really enhanced the flavors of the already delicious dishes. The owner was very sweet and kind, and service was quick. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants  a unique experience and delicious food for a heck of a deal - $6 for a plate of 12 and $1 for the potato ball. We tried the butter tea ($1.50) which wasn't really my cup of tea, but it was a unique flavour and something to try at least once :). Will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"A 5 deserved just for the service and experience! 

I asked for beef and veggie momo. Wanted one take out and one dine in but the owner just quickly grabbed me both takeout as they were already prepared. That was fine as I ended up stepping out to grab my friend from the bus stop. I told him I would go out and come back to dine in. He said he could serve me new fresh ones and on a plate when I come back. I declined to not be troublesome and worried the ones I got in takeout were warm/cold. However, even after going outside with them and coming back, they were piping hot! Yay!
Asked for a butter tea but he said the butter spoils too quick so they always run out, having limited quantities.
The hot sauce was unexpectedly HOT. I love spicy so I decided to pour the whole hot sauce container on my momos. Aieyah, way too hot. I had to stop and save the rest for later. The hot sauce was unique, delicious, and very fragrant.
Momos wrappers had perfect thickness and flavour. Much more filling than average pot stickers imo. 
- 10 momos for $7 +tax"}
{"text":"Sad that it took me soooo long to check this place out - wicked good beef momos - their hot sauce is FIRE - and super reasonable price - 10 x momo's and a pop for under $8!"}
{"text":"I have lived in a part of India where Tibetan food was a regular thing. Since my move to Toronto, I have been searching for a true momo joint. If you want simplicity in your food and want food cooked with love, go here. The menu has 6 food items. The beef momo is the winner. 10 steamed deliciousness filled with juicy perfectly marinated beef to die for. I visit this joint once a week from Mississauga. A must visit for anyone who loves simplicity with their food!"}
{"text":"I wandered in one winter day, after I had been directed to try Loga's Corner. 
Parkdale has a large Tibetan community and they have made use of the area to show off Tibetan cuisine. 
I'm a fan of all of them,each restaurant have their own specialties, quirks and character. 
Loga's Corner is just that, a quirky and special Tibetan dine-in / take-out location with, in my opinion, delicious-omnomtastic- momo's. 

I'm a fan. A huge Fan. 
Their momo's are delicious and the hot sauce, is off the hook!

It's a sit in or take-out restaurant. 

Yesterday, I ordered beef, fried beef and chicken (each order comes in 10 pieces), and while I waited for my take out I had a potato ball. Total? $22.60 

A month ago, same thing with mango Lassi - to help counter the spice. They don't win on the Mango Lassi part, but I really wasn't there for that so.... pfft. 

I've also ordered their veggie and their parathas and was lucky to have the paratha's fresh. So, super omnom. nom nom. 

I've eaten here quite a few times since January and I don't plan on stopping soon. 

This is a family run restaurant and the owner's definitely make you feel like your a part of it when you go in and dine, or are waiting for your food."}
{"text":"When I was in NY my uber driver recommended this place to me . I have never had Tibetan food and was curious. It did not disappoint. Had the chicken and potato dumpling. Next time I am going to get the fried dumpling."}
{"text":"HOT SAUCE! I know it's known for its momo's which are really yummy and affordable but I LOVE the hot sauce served here. I've tried many and no where comes close to the heat that Loga's Corner has. Forget tabasco or sirarcha, if you want to feel the burn this is the place to go. I also recommend the vegetarian momos."}
{"text":"I been to toronto a few times but this time i made it a point to stop by here and try this place out. I was not disappointed!!

The momo and the beef soup were amazing. I honestly did not think i would  finish it all , it was so much food!!! The place itself is nice and cozy and the staff is super friendly! When im in Toronto again i will def stop by !!"}
{"text":"As someone who is a huge fan of tasty & affordable take-out, I don't know how it took me 2 years of living in Parkdale before trying Loga's. Call me a new convert though! I was in and out in a time comparable to a fast food joint, but with 10 delicious fried beef momos for $8 instead of some greasy generic burger/etc. And the hot sauce! As everyone before me has stated, the stuff is killer - but flavourful enough that you'll enjoy every almost-painful bite. I will absolutely be back, and hopefully with friends. This neighborhood gem is worth showing off!"}
{"text":"Went to logas for the fist time by fluke and it was totally worth it. We had The best momo ever, you have to try the beef momo. 
Also, the most kind staff in town.
We are definitely going back."}

One can never have enough momo's."}
{"text":"Loga's Corner is located just steps away from Lansdowne and Queen St W. on a smaller street. Easy to miss if you don't know what is hidden there. 

I decided to drop by Loga's Corner for a quick lunch as I was around the area. Upon arrival, I ordered my food at the counter. Food was given to me quickly as well as some spicy pickled radish. There was a lot of space to sit down and I quickly tried my first ever momo. Biting into my first momo a gush of momo juice came out and onto my plate. The flavour is unique and slightly different from the regular Chinese dumplings I was used to eating. The spicy pickled radish was great as well! Refreshing as I ate the momo and radish together.

Overall, super friendly family run place and cheap too! I couldn't believe it when it was only $6 for a plate of delicious momos (10 per order). Definitely want to try more of the food this place has to offer and introduce these delicious momos to others!"}
