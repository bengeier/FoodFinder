{"text":"I come get all the time and yes the bagels are very good but the staff could be a little friendlier. Also they had OVER an hour yet to close and they looked like they were closing.  The chairs were stacked on all the tables towards the back. You  don't start stacking you're chairs that early.  Where's the customer service.  There is none... and that's too bad because I really love the bagels there...."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I ordered a steak and egg bagel then after I paid said they were out so I only got an egg and cheese bagel with no compensation. They gave our order to someone else! The people went and took them out and touched the whole thing then they brought it back and poked at it to show it wasn't theirs. The staff re wrapped the bagels then gave it to us! Even though the other people already touched the whole bagel!"}
{"text":"When I am on that side of the city I have to make a trip for lunch. Love the Multi grain bagel. I always get a few to go. Haven't found a multi grain like it anywhere else like them, love all crunch with seeds."}
{"text":"This is at the Arboretum in S. Charlotte.  Anyway, I ate bagels at this place when I was growing up on the way to high school 16 years ago.  It may have been called something different.  Upon recently moving back to the area, tried it again, and BANG!  Best Everything bagels ever.  All Bagels made in house NY style.  If you like inexpensive, delicious made in house bagels, youll love it.  This place is real deal."}
{"text":"I can't say enough amazing things about the staff and food!! I have not had anything from here that wasn't amazing! The staff is so sweet and helpful it makes you feel like you have known them forever."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte, definitely.  Great selection, great texture, fast and convenient.  I am thankful to have a turkey bacon option!  I have a few nit-picks.  #1-No sourdough bagels. #2, Their breakfast bagel sandwiches are expensive and the ratio of egg/cheese/bacon is pitiful next to a huge dense and chewy bagel.  Kind of skimpy for $5. #3, The checkout process is highly annoying on the weekends.  Order at one computer with one girl who doesn't know what she's doing, can't pay at that computer, snake around the counter to the next girl who is even less adept at cashing out to finally pay.  A streamlined system would be appreciated for those who can't spend 45 minutes paying for a bagel on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Service is the only downfall here. High probability of getting your order incorrect or incomplete. Hard to understand who's name they call out when your order is ready. \"Good morning 'garbled name\" is not a sufficient way to let people know your order is ready. Service is friendly but just not trained on true hospitality or restaurant industry. Drink/coffee area can be a mess and is very limited on space for people to get their beverages.   I've been coming here for years because the food is good and its the only Bagel shop in the Arboretum."}
{"text":"My family loves Manhattan Bagel. One of our favorite places. So many choices of bagels and sandwiches, fresh food made to order and can get a breakfast sandwich any time of day."}
{"text":"That is literally the best bagel ever eaten outside the isle of Manhattan. I had the everything bagel with lox and cream cheese and capers and it was truly magnificent. There was a line on Saturday morning but it moved swiftly. You order at the first register & pay at the second one. I cannot wait to try more of the flavors! As a former New Yorker I am happy to find you. A big thank you to Manhattan bagel!"}
{"text":"Ok. Staff is not friendly at all. Often coffee canisters are empty. Surprisingly long wait for a toasted bagel (5+ minutes). They never clean toaster or slicer so every bagel you get tastes like onion. So if you buy a dozen, I'd recommend slicing them at home."}
{"text":"I had previously had a great experience at Manhattan bagel, however this visit wasn't as pleasant. I ordered a toasted bagel with butter and lox, when I got my bagel it was room temperature at  best. I asked if it could be reheated.... they threw the entire bagel including the lox in the microwave. It was now a lot warmer but so was my lox, which took all the moisture out of the lox. At this point I was annoyed and disgusted. My boyfriend went up and asked for it to be remade, they remade it and it was a lot better however it wasn't the original bagel I had ordered. But at this point I didn't care and just ate it so I could leave."}
{"text":"There's no multigrain bread for the club sandwich even though it says so on the menu.  Just bagels.  A minor point and it's a bagel joint.  But there's a picture of a club with bread right next to it, so confusing nonetheless.  Chips are Einstein Bros Bagel Co. and pretty good and all the ingredients on the turkey are fresh and tasty so I would try them again."}
{"text":"Their Ham omlet special with sausage and a freshly buttered bagel are the greatest!"}
{"text":"The bagels are always fresh and delicious.  Their might be lines at times, but it is worth the wait.  Their breakfast sandwiches are made to order with real eggs and are served hot."}
{"text":"Typical bagel shop.  Great coffee!  Good variety.  Gets slammed just about everyday.  They offer egg substitute or egg whites as well, so you can take in those extra empty calories in the bagel and save on the egg."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, with delicious bagels. I tried the chorizo avocado sunrise sandwich and it was delicious with the right amount of spicy"}
{"text":"There is but one item in the menu I am reviewing here: the bagels!!!!! Don't give a hoot about sandwiches. Couldn't care less about spreads or drinks or salads. Having been spoiled by ethnic enclaves in Detroit I was crestfallen to find not a single bagel establishment near me with authentic Jewish style bagels (MUST. BE. BOILED!!!). These are boiled and thus authentic or as close as u could possibly get without paying a fortune to have H&H bagels shipped from New York! The only thing that stinks for me is that I usually only get what's left as I only get to the area when I see a certain doctor and wind up going in early afternoon but they do take orders, so will employ that next time. Delicious bagels... Not the fake bread ones like Einstein or Panera"}
{"text":"Bagels here are step up from Panera, Brueggers, einsteins, etc.  Try to get mail coupons from here.  The inside is very cramped, hot, and staff could be friendlier."}
{"text":"This is a particularly good bagel shop in the South Charlotte/Ballantyne area of Charlotte, North Carolina. It seems to be \"family run\", which adds to it's charm and attention to detail.   As bagel shops go, it's definitely as good as it gets, with an amazing variety of bagels and danish. They also offer breakfast sandwiches that are made to order. On the side they offer fruit cups, yogurt, and delicious coffee drinks to rev up your energy for the day.   Their bagels are hot and fresh, and the store is set up in a very organized fashion, so when you walk in you can order right up at the counter where you can view the different bagel and pastry options, and then grab your coffee and a table where you can sit down to wait. Unlike other bagel companies, they create your sandwich off to the side in their cooking area, so it doesn't feel as if you are waiting forever to get your sandwich. They call you when it is ready. We like the way they have things set up. It is fast and convenient. At other bagel shops, it always feels as if you are waiting forever while watching the employees make a sandwich that seems to bewilder them. That is not the case at Manhattan Bagel, especially at this location. This one is great.   This bagel shop is definitely a favorite.   Parking is readily available in the private shopping center lot, and on busy weekend mornings it fills up around the store, but there are plenty of spaces available."}
{"text":"I always get the jalape√±o cheddar bagel lightly toasted and just switch up the cream cheese flavor-I love the original or garden vegetable. Bagels are so fresh and deliciously chewy! Fast and friendly service, great for on the run."}
{"text":"So glad this place is still here even though they opened up a panera nearby! Line moves quickly, everything bagels are COVERED in everything on BOTH sides and the ice coffee is delicious. No, the staff is not super chatty but they are cranking out the orders in a timely fashion. The owners are GREAT and often there taking orders.   Favorite sandwich: the lox bagel with everything on it. On a honey whole wheat everything bagel, of course! I wish it came with a side of fruit instead of a carb but I'm assuming that's a Manhattan thing, not an individual store thing."}
{"text":"Worst stale sesame bagel I think ever! Well I didn't really have it cause after one bite we left on our table and walked out. Yuck. Husband had his toasted and that didn't help the staleness."}
{"text":"This place is great !! I came in and had the special the 99 cents begel and cream cheese  What a deal ! I wish it was all year long I would definitely be going back even after the special ends."}
{"text":"First time here, even though there was a line it moved quickly. Had the cinnamon toast sandwich and their holiday blend coffee. The coffee was horrible and whomever is responsible for making it needs more training! The coffee was watered down so much that it had absolute ZERO flavor! Messed up my morning coffee...sad that my first experience was a bad one."}
{"text":"Chicken salad croissant was nasty with a synthetic onion taste. When I said it was awful and I couldn't eat it the manager argued with me. I finally ended up getting credited and bought a bagel with just some cream cheese. Yes the accommodated me but I sure didn't appreciate the argument. Not going back."}
{"text":"Very solid sandwiches. Tasty bacon. Tasty everything bagels. Empire State club and thintastic turkey are 2 of my favorites. A little bit on the higher side of the price range but it is worth the quality sandwhich."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tried a sandwich that was recommended by the cashier (her own special creation) and I instantly fell in love with it. Recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Arboretum store, which appears to be one of the few still open in Charlotte.   While their bagels were OK, I was extremely disappointed with the service I received here.  I stopped in on a Sunday morning, and to my surprise they didn't appear very busy. A few people sitting at the tables, maybe one person waiting for their order and one person in line behind me.  I placed an order for a dozen bagels and requested they be sliced. I was told they could do that. However, as I was paying for my order, the girl handed me the same bag of bagels, informing me she checked with her manager, and they didn't have time to slice them for me. I pushed back that I really needed them sliced for the event I was on my way to, but again, my request was refused.  Seriously? A bagel shop that won't slice your bagels? It wasn't as if I walked in unexpectedly when they were slammed, placed an order for four dozen bagels, and made some extravagant request.  Having just done the same thing the week before at Bruegger's in Cotswold, where the girl happily sliced my dozen bagels and brushed off my apologies for the extra step (even though they actually were busy!), I was shocked at Manhattan Bagel's treatment and lack of customer service.  Despite this bagel shop being a few minutes closer to my house than Cotswold, Manhattan Bagel has lost my future business."}
{"text":"Good New York style bagels which we don't have a home.  Would get bagels from here again."}
{"text":"We have spent $20 here at least 2 times a week for a long time... Usually it's on point and mads to order... Sometimes they mess up in the kitchen... Today was the worst experience... Have had one bagel sent back 3 times because they can't get it right... And I feel that if it isn't done right the second time that the third time your doing it that you're now just trying to piss me off... Seriously messing up this gorgeous Sunday morning! Waiting for it to come out for the 4th time... Let's pray they get it right or I'm never coming back. Ever      Update;;   Since we were given a free bagel voucher for the previous mess up... Had Manhattan again this morning.. They got mine right but then completely left bacon off the second bagel... What a joke.. The food is delicious when it is made correctly and to your order but they just don't seem to have a care in the world recently... Disappointed! They have truly fallen off... Won't be coming here for a long while... Hope they can get their business together!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how good the food is if the customer service is bad I will not support your establishment.  1. I asked do they have grits.  The answer was a cold ride no. That's fine. I ordered bagel with butter to go.  2. I ordered hot black tea. The attendant rang it up then pointed to the tea bags. They were all kinds of flavors but no black tea. I asked for a refund and the guy whom I suspect to be the owner came up and rolled his eyes gave me my refund and hastily dumped the water out.   3. Same day as the previous incident in ordered and gave my name \"jeff\". All the sudden same gut from the back kept saying \"Jim\". No answer. Then after waiting he said the order. I replied oh I'm Jeff not Jim. His response jeff Jim whatever. I'm done and not returning."}
{"text":"I came in with my trusty Yelp Check-In coupon for a free bagel and cream cheese.  Expecting a plain bagel with plain cream cheese, boy was I surprised.  First of all they use the same filtered water as any Manhattan/ Charlotte establishment, but they are able to recreate the chewy dough with a number of options you find in most NY bagel shops.  I tried the jalapeno and cheese bagel with garlic and herbs cream cheese. (Yes, the check-in coupon worked on this).  My wife got the less fancy honey whole wheat bagel but the Tijuana Hot cream cheese, which the employee indicated that it was definitely \"hot, with a kick to it\".  I agree, it does have a kick to it, but definitely manageable.  The tijuana hot was my favorite as it reminded me of a hotter version of pimiento cheese.  They also offered various sandwiches, wraps, and other creations that were reasonably priced, but they are only open in the mornings till about 3-4pm depending on the day.  I will have to try the one in uptown for lunch one day."}
{"text":"Quick, good, tasty, affordible. Lovr the cofre selection."}
{"text":"A quaint little coffee shop. Not gluten friendly at all, however their coffee blends are unique and have great aroma...that's what is pulled me in the first time. They are efficient and quick to prepare something. The staff is pleasant- not above average but some do try to go the extra mile. The coffee station could be cleaned and cared for more frequently but it's an \"in and out\" type of shop. They do have a few tables- but it was crammed down the side reminding me of high school. I have gone in and order a side of bacon to go for a quick snack and they prepared it very well, and kept it hot and crispy with their packaging. A great place to swing in and try something new!"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm the guy who had a pumpernickel bagel before heading to the dentist. But it was a decent bagel and re-toasted properly. The jalapeno cream cheese does have some go to it.  Good coffee as well.  It's a small place but it does a decent amount of business and it's definitely inexpensive.  Wifi works well."}
{"text":"They just charged me 1.57 for this solo cup of cream cheese. This will only cover one half of my bagel. Suggestion, invest in a larger container."}
{"text":"Great stop in the Arboretum Shopping Center. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. The bagel selection is great and the food always tastes fresh. I recommend the Nova Lox with an iced coffee!"}
{"text":"Bagels are cheap, with a wide variety to chose from!  The size of the place is small, but does make you feel like you are in a manhattan like environment, giving the new york feeling.  food is always hot and fresh, and tastes amazing no matter what kind you get."}
{"text":"Love going here for a quick breakfast. The food has been excellent the two time I've been. Bagel, with an egg. Simple enough meal, but the taste is very good. Its fast service as well. Can't beat it for a quick breakfast in this area."}
{"text":"This place was pretty slammed for a Sunday morning.  Not exactly the way I wanted to spend my morning waiting in line (felt like I was being herded like livestock).... then it was a bit of a wait for my Ranchero Wrap.  It turned out to be good, but I was not a fan of the waiting and the whole setup they have going in there.  Space is limited- they definitely nailed down the NY feel since it felt like I was on top of everyone and there is a long narrow room where the tables (not too clean) were set up.    Since I live in Charlotte, I value my personal space, so this place is definitely not for me - or at least not worth the drive from Matthews on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Management has very poor customer service. Coffee is rarely filled and usually cold. If you want to feel appreciated as a customer you are better off going to Panera down the street. Id rather eat cardboard than give 2 cents to Manhattan Bagel."}
