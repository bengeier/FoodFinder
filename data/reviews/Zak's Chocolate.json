{"text":"Excellent chocolate! I went to a Factory Tour and Jim and Maureen explained us every the chocolate making process. We got to taste the chocolate in different stages, roasted, 100% without sugar, etc. It was a great experience! The chocolate is fantastic! Must do in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am not a chocolate lover but, ZAKS can serve me anytime.  Their product us undoubtedly the absolute best chocolate I've ever had."}
{"text":"You guys. This is some fine chocolate. I'm typically not a fan chocolate or truffle shops- I feel like the flavors and fillings overpower the chocolate so I typically don't even bother. 

I was gifted a 4 piece box and I gotta say- Zak's Chocolate actually lets their chocolate be the star player. Flavors are muted and subtly present- but undeniable and they perfectly complement the ganache inside! I loved the Earl Grey Lavender flavor and also love how they partner with local coffee shop Peixoto to create some killer Cascara and mocha chocolates! 

I'm no chocolatier by any means, but I can't deny a truffle done right. It looks like I'm gonna have to treat myself to a box every now and again...."}
{"text":"These chocolates are way too overpriced and the minute I walked in with my service dog the guy was a total jerk to me and asked me to leave I told him my dog was a service dog and he says OK well I have to tell you that your dog can't be in here unless it's a service dog and it totally ruined the entire experience he was awful why would I support someone who treated me that way the minute I first walked in the door as a new customer three dollars for a chocolate the size of my thumb and abuse the minute I walk in the door absolutely not I will not support this business

Your response below, doesn't excuse how rude he was and the awful experience! They didn't even say hello when i walked in, he just looked at me in disgust and stared....chocolate was in one small glass case, like the counters you see at a jewelry store, NOT A FOOD PLACE, and the case was the size of typical office desk....it was as though they just moved on & had one tiny display for a few chocolates. Like i said won't step foot in this awful unfriendly place again!!"}
{"text":"I have not attended an event like this before, nor have i experienced the taste of craft chocolate...let me just say WOW!!!! I attended the first anniversary party last night and cannot express how amazing the chocolate tastes. I can't imagine buying a Hershey's bar after experiencing how magical the craft chocolate tastes. 

The owners were truly informative about the beginning and end process. It is hard work that takes time and dedication to create such wonderful tasting desserts. Thank you for hosting this event, I will be recommending this tour to all friends and family!"}
{"text":"Everything about this shop is wonderful. The husband and wife team were delightful. The husband was more than happy to tell us all about the history of their business, how the chocolate is made, and how the cocoa beans are grown. The chocolate is nothing short of amazing, with wonderfully creative flavors and the presentation is absolutely exquisite! I would highly recommend this place for a gift or a special treat."}
{"text":"The skill that goes into this chocolate making is obvious from the moment it touches your tongue. Quality chocolate and sophisticated flavors show how much the creator(s) care about the blending of flavors. We've tried several truffles, and will absolutely be back. My son (age 12), pleaded with me to go in to try \"one or two\". We left with four, and went back the following week. I was surprised he liked them as much as he did (read the entire brochure on the business and was impressed with the packaging, attention to detail as much as the flavor), because they aren't like anything children are generally drawn to - again, sophisticated flavors; not overly sweet, and tart is tart without the 'bite'. You have to try to fully appreciate. By far the best flavor combinations I've encountered and worth the price. As a native, one can easily find okay food for too much money - goes with the territory. But the taste is truly chocolate perfection.  We have yet to try the brownies (were highly recommended). If you're looking for that perfect, \"Thinking of you\" gift to brighten someone's day, or a personal indulgence - this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Hands down best chocolate in AZ! Carefully sourced cacao coming from cacao-producing countries, meticulously roasted and transformed into small-batch chocolate. This is what chocolate is supposed to taste like and you can see the whole process take place behind the scenes when Jim and Maureen make the chocolate. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Oh My!!!   I just returned from a \"Chocolate Factory Tour\" at Zak's .........  can I say FAN BLOODY TASTIC!!!     Soooooo glad I went!!
So I work at \"SORSO\" Wine Room at the Scottsdale Quarter, and last week we started to carry Zak's chocolate ..... the whole idea being to \"pair\" their chocolate with our wines and/or cheese's.    Wanting to know more about this \"new\" product,  I checked out their webpage/FB etc.   To my delight.... they offered a tour of their facility ...... for only $20.     Off course I booked one there and then!!   
The facility/business is run by Jim and his wife Maureen, who absolutely LOVE what they do!!  And love showing it to you!!    You get to taste a fair number of chocolates, in various stages of the process, and you learn soooo much!!
I will just sign off here, and highly recommend you take a tour!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Zak's before and then my boyfriend's sister signed us up for a chocolate making class there. I was initially a little skeptical and wasn't quite sure what I was in for but it ended up being a great experience. 

Maureen and Jim walk you through every step of the chocolate making process. We were taken into the kitchen and shown how the cacao beans are stored, roasted, separated, ground and any other steps that I am forgetting. It's a really neat experience for anyone.

Throughout the entire experience they encourage you to taste the chocolate at different stages. By the time the class was ending, I couldn't even think about eating any more chocolate. We did end up buying some of their gourmet chocolates for later and I would highly recommend the peanut butter cups. Yum.

It's not very often that you find anyone that has as much passion for what they do as Maureen and Jim. I would definitely recommend taking a chocolate making class or just picking up some chocolates from their store."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome. You get to try chocolate from all over the world. You never realize how different chocolate can be until you visit a place like this. Chocolate bars are the way to go here. It's just really really good chocolate.  Definitely a place to take someone to watch them be amazed and see how the chocolate is made from bean , to roast, to bar"}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate connoisseur, Zak's is a MUST try! They make all of their chocolates directly from the cocoa bean. My friend and I attended their 1st Anniversary party/tasting last Friday night and it was a blast! They were sampling chocolates from different regions, like Guatemala, Brazil, etc. It was so cool to taste the different hints of spiciness, earthiness, etc. according to the region that the beans were from. We also sampled their coca bean cold brew that they may start selling soon! It was delicious and was a lot lighter than coffee bean cold brew. It almost tasted like tea with a hint of cocoa...seriously so unique and yum!

They have a variety of creative flavors and my absolute favorite is their lavender chocolate. Holy heaven, this one is delicious! Not only are their craft chocolates delicious, they're also GORGEOUS! They have beautiful designs and come in various shapes. They also print out a special label just for your box, since you can hand pick which chocolates you would like to purchase. 

This adorable, family-owned chocolate shop is a must visit, whether you're just popping in to cure your sweet tooth or looking for a nice gift for a friend or co-worker, you can't go wrong at Zak's! They also offer chocolate-making classes where you can learn the magic behind their craft chocolates!"}
{"text":"Wonderful chocolate and wonderful customer service!!!! My go to spot to treat myself and my friends! I highly recommend stopping in to get some delicious chocolates and learn a good deal about chocolate. The honey chocolate and prickly pear chocolate were awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow. We don't want to reveal too much because you'll just need to stop, taste, see, and meet the two folks running the place.  They make their own chocolate, from the bean.  There's $10 tours or $75/person make your own chocolate.  The chocolates are beautiful and decadent which you'll find just from the samples but buy a bar so you can enjoy it afterwards too! 

Missy grabbed the hibiscus caramel- omg yummy made from crushed hibiscus leaf.  And the turtles look like turtles! Ha!"}
{"text":"Wonderful chocolates that are breathtaking. The owner is so nice and very helpful. I bought a 12 piece and all were divine. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I love chocolate but I love craft chocolate even more!!! The owners are passionate about their work and it shows with how much they know about their product. 

We went for a chocolate factory tour and it was pretty amazing to learn about the process and all the work that goes into making chocolate. Being able to walk around and see the machines in action was quite remarkable. We had a chance to try a few different types of chocolate from their traditional dark to their new milk chocolate. Knowing where their beans come from makes it even better.

Some of my favorite chocolates were the marshmallow and the cup o' joe. They used Peixoto's coffee to make the chocolates infused with coffee. It was delectable and a perfect blend. They also make their marshmallow and caramel from scratch. So if you love buying locally and supporting small businesses, come on over and check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We got a 5 piece. Each piece with an individual design and a truffle style filling. There are no food pieces, just locally sourced flavored infused in the center chocolate. The owners were hard at work, and their customer service and knowledge showed that they were true artisans of their craft. The sample bar even had pieces from five different kinds of cocoa beans. Can't wait to try their limited options again."}
{"text":"Used to dislike dark chocolate but apparently I had just never had real chocolate to begin with! Did the factory tour last week and the owners were great, very open about the process and very passionate about what they do. No more Hershey's for me!"}
{"text":"These guys know their stuff! A great mix of single origin chocolate as well as beautiful and delicious flavored truffles and other confections. 
Impressive hospitality and a clean space. 
If you are looking for a truly local, handcrafted product, this is where to look."}
{"text":"Best. Chocolate. Ever. The passion that this couple has really shines in their amazing selections of chocolates & cocoa powders. If you're a chocolate lover, you really
haven't experienced chocolaty goodness until you've visited this place. Make sure to save room for ice cream!"}
{"text":"THE MOST DELECTABLE **HOMEMADE** DARK CHOCOLATE!
What a special treat to have in Scottsdale.  The owners are extremely knowledgeable in the art of chocolate making and I can't wait to see what other favors they will come up with. 
I tried the lavender, caramel, caramel turtle, peanut butter cup, and the brownie. All were fabulous but I was super impressed with the brownie. Ask for it to be heated and you'll have little bits of melted chocolate throughout the rich texture. The lavender chocolate reminded me of my trip to Paris. 
Next time I go in I'm going to try the rise and the Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"I just wanted to do a quick review of Zak's. I stopped by Zak's on Valentines Day to get a little something special for my wife. As you can imagine, it was a very busy place. I was so impressed with the level of service I received! The owner took the time to explain the different truffle flavors and their ingredients. I was so excited to have my wife try these as she is a connoisseur of dark chocolate. Needless to say, she loved them! While slightly expensive, I think they're well worth the additional expense. I also think supporting a small business like Zak's is important as well. If you're looking for that perfect thing to show someone you really care, check it out!"}
{"text":"Elegant. Delicious. I fine product. Chocolate from around the world. Peruvian Nicaraguan Haitian Guatemalan and Belize."}
{"text":"I mean seriously, chocolate can get better, who knew!!!  I am so so happy to know about Zak's, I can honestly see this being my only source for my Chocolate addiction. The bars blew my mind, the flavors are all amazing, and you can have so much variety.  I loved the truffles also, the earl grey lavender was my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm in trouble now! I am completely hooked on the fine chocolate that comes from using just three simple ingredients: roasted cocoa beans, sugar and cocoa butter. This is not like a Hershey Bar that you consume all at once. Just put a single square on your tongue, let it melt there, and enjoy. Depending on where owners Jim and Maureen source the beans from, each bar will have a different taste to it. Though the chocolate may seem expensive at first glance, know that you are paying for quality.

If you sign up for their emails, you'll find great events such as their Open House, where they allowed guests to sample a wide variety of chocolates, and give input, rate the types etc. Based on the results from those surveys, Zak's has purchased cocoa beans from the winning chocolate's country (Nicaragua) and will soon be producing another type of delicious chocolate from it. How cool is that to be involved in the process?!

If you don't know much about small batch chocolate, come for the $10 tour. Even better, take the $75 chocolate making class like my husband and I took our two boys to. (Note: They are 12 and 15 yrs old. I don't think it's meant for younger kids)

So now my whole family makes the trek out from Mesa to enjoy this delicious chocolate! Come check it out."}
{"text":"Of you want the tastiest chocolates with some original flavors....this is THE place.  I buy in smaller quantities as i consume it too quickly. You have to try the hazelnuts  covered in chocolate. OMGOSH!!!"}
{"text":"I was following Zak's on Facebook (love their page, btw) and decided to drop in when my mom was in town. They have some amazing chocolates, I highly recommend the mint, cinnamon plum (which is beautiful and the cinnamon is very mild), and earl grey. Their chocolates are beautiful and taste amazing. Not to mention they are very knowledgeable about their product too. Oh! And don't forget to taste the chocolate samples of chocolate roasted in different countries, that's very cool. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"It's beautiful and delicious and the staff was super helpful and friendly definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the chocolate and staff at Zak's! I did a chocolate tour which was highly informative and super fun. The owners are super sweet and very passionate about what they do - it shows! I am a big chocolate person so I'm very happy I found Zak's and can help support local! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in to try Zak's marshmallows and Zak's chocolate ice cream (made with its Guatemala chocolate), but found both were out of stock-- the corn-free marshmallows will return sometime in March, while the ice cream will be ready for purchase at the store in \"a couple of days.\"  (It's always in stock at Super Chunk in Old Town Scottsdale, where it is made, owner Jim Elitzak told me.)  Zak's truffles and chocolates case was full of beautiful chocolaty gems [1], but I wanted something else... Ah, perhaps my first foray into the brownies?  Are they available today?  Why, yes!  Well, I'll have that and a cup of your Mocha [2], please!

I've had Zak's Mocha at downtown Chandler's Peixoto Coffee before, but this is the first time I've ordered it here, and yes, it's made with Peixoto's La Famiglia coffee.  I immediately detected cherry notes in the mocha and asked Jim if the notes I tasted came from the chocolate used, or from the coffee, and he said it would be from the former.  Zak's uses a blend of chocolates for its mochas and a \"house blend\" for its truffles and chocolates gorgeously-displayed in the shop's chocolate case.

And how were the brownies?  They were magnificent, and oh, so gooey!  The Belize had a slightly tart flavor, but not as tangy and/or fruity as the other two.  It definitely filled my dark chocolate craving!  The Madagascar brownie was tarter (more tart) than the Belize and Guatemala Lachua.  The brownie flight flyer stated that the GL has \"deep fruity notes.\"  It had a more-rounded flavor profile than the Madagascar, which was slightly tarter.  I'd say that if you're looking for a blend of tart and chocolate, then the Guatemala Lachua is your brownie.  While I enjoyed all three, I'd say my favorites were the Belize and the GL, with Belize being my top fave.  I found myself loving the dark chocolate focus of the Belize, while the other two AND the mocha featured acidic notes.  I think I'll order a pour over next time I order a brownie flight so as not to overwhelm my tastebuds with piquant notes!

Truly enjoyed this afternoon's experience-- thanks to Jim and wife Maureen's chocolate shop!

[1] Chocolates and truffles are now $2.50, tax included, each!  Menu reads:

4 ct. box= $10, 6 ct. box= $15, 12 ct. box= $29.50
8 ct. box= $20, 12 ct. box= $30, 24 ct. box= $59

Did not notice how much the Turtles cost now, so cannot report, sorry!

[2] $5 (tax included) for a tiny cup of mocha?  Ouch!  I don't even think the cup I drank from contained 8 oz.  Looked more like 6, but I could be mistaken...  A small (8 oz.) Mocha at Peixoto, which used to feature Zak's chocolate, but is now showcasing another local chocolatier, is about the same price, if you factor in taxes, but add another dollar and get double the amount, or 16 oz.  Hmm... Guess I'll just make the trek out to Chandler if I run out of my Peixoto coffee supply at home.  I'm thinking the fact that Zak's is chocolate-centric and not really a coffee shop may explain the high price of coffee here.  Something different I MAY try next time is Zak's Shakerato-- an iced coffee beverage that is made using a cocktail shaker.  Something to look forward to in the warmer months coming up!"}
{"text":"Talk about fancy chocolate! The selection is somewhat limited in my opinion, but I enjoyed what I tried. 

I started with the samples. They offer 69%-80%, about six different kinds, all from different countries. The Madagascar was my favorite!

I picked two truffles - Ginger Tangerine and Coconut. They both were dark chocolate with a rich ganache center. The former definitely had a stronger ginger flavor than lime. It was nice, but I really enjoyed the Coconut. It was creamy, simple and devine!

The service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Love the chocolate, but I love the chocolatiers (couple who own the shop) even more!! They have so much knowledge on the matter and it shows in their different types of chocolate they produce. I usually get some type of truffle to eat right there and a couple bars of chocolate to take home. It is dark chocolate made of only three ingredients. There are bars from different beans around the world. There is a smokey tasting chocolate bar which has an interesting story! Ask about it:)"}
{"text":"I found Zak's on yelp, was looking for some awesome chocolate for Easter.  I'm so glad I stopped in, what a little gem.  The chocolate is produced from bean to finished product here.  It is evident there is a lot of passion by the owner and it comes through in everything he makes.
Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"The owners are extremely friendly and helpful, stopped in with a very loud misbehaving 4 year old in tow and owner was very patient as we selected some truffles and the brownie trio.  The store itself is also very beautiful and a great place to sit for an espresso and a treat.  The brownies were hands down the best brownies I have ever tasted, and I've traveled to France, Switzerland, and Italy and have sampled them there.  It was like a molten cake center with dark chocolate oozing out and outside was perfectly crisp and chewy.  It was heaven, try the brownies and have the owner warm it up for you.  Sinful!"}
{"text":"Not many people are familiar with craft chocolate, but I am hoping that will change. Part of that is getting over any fears of \"dark chocolate.\" First off, most of what you have had in the past is probably \"bad\" dark chocolate that has been produced at scale and stripped of any defining elements. If you're a coffee drinker, it is something like over-roasting the beans and can result in a consistent, albeit somewhat bitter, experience. 

The chocolates made at Zak's are \"three-ingredient\" chocolates, although you could argue that it is two since they use cacao beans and sugar as the primary ingredients (the third is some extra cocoa butter to enhance the texture). With so few ingredients, there is nothing in the way of the true flavor of the chocolate, so you get to experience all of the nuances of flavor in the beans from the different regions. If you are accustomed to \"big chocolate\" and don't believe that you can taste differences, you're in for a real treat!

We have been to some other craft chocolate shops and have been on tours before, so we were somewhat familiar with the process. I signed the family up for one of their chocolate making classes and we spent the evening with Jim and, periodically, Maureen, who popped in to make sure we stayed on track :D 

Seriously, though, it was a rare opportunity to ask questions and experience the process first-hand: we created chocolate from the raw cacao beans and sugar. I had a great time, and my kids even enjoyed participating in the bean-to-bar process. Like many things, the process is straightforward, but the attention to details along the way can greatly affect the finished product. The passion and attention to these details is something that makes Zak's stand out in my mind.

From a chocolate perspective, my family prefers dark chocolates, and I really enjoy *just* chocolate, with maybe some roasted almonds. I'm a fan of the plain chocolate bars, but they do offer a wide variety of truffles and such that Maureen crafts in-house using local ingredients. Tip: the brownies are amazing. We were fortunate to get them while they were still warm, and I can only imagine one with a cup of coffee or a glass of cold milk. 

If you're at all interested in the process, sign up for one of their $10 tours. If you are a food geek, or just REALLY like chocolate, the $75 (3-hour) class is worth it and includes that tour.

I think I would be here all the time if I didn't live so far away. As it is, I am planning my next visit so that I can stock up!"}
{"text":"We were dining nearby and happened to see a sign for Zak's. Who wouldn't want to check out some chocolate? So in we went... and wow. I am so glad we did. 

We were greeted by who I assume is the owner.. he was so nice and welcoming, and told us about their chocolate making process. He then went over the individual pieces and their chocolate bars, answering all questions and giving us great background on all the items. 

We opted for the 12 piece box so we got to try most of the individual pieces. While they were all great, favorites definitely included the coconut, honey and mocha pieces. On top of the delicious flavor, they are also soooo pretty. A box would be great for a gift or special occasion. 

We will most certainly be back, and also check our the various events they have from time to time, which are detailed on their website. Check this place out!

Update: after returning several times for the amazing chocolate pieces and lovely customer service, we finally got the opportunity to take the 4-hour chocolate making experience class. It was so much fun and so informational! We found out the process from bean to bar and got to sample lots of different chocolate and beans along the way. We even got to try their ice cream and one of their single origin brownies. You get to make liquid chocolate to take home as well as some custom made chocolate discs. Super fun experience and absolutely worth it, I would recommend if you are into dark chocolate. I'll continue to come here way too often :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Zak's Chocolate today, and I'm so glad I stopped by to give these chocolates a try. Zak's chocolate is the best chocolate I have ever had, hands down.... so delicious! The service was superb too :). I'm looking forward to going back soon for more."}
{"text":"There is a reason why Zak's has 5 stars. We took out of town family for a day trip and we stopped into Zak's. WOW the chocolate was absolutely the best! Real chocolate not store bought junk. Even the family gave rave reviews about the coffee. You must stop in if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"The chocolate here is completely and utterly divine. Melt in your mouth, tickle your tastebuds, deliciousness that you cannot imagine. I'd come back again and again for their little bits of chocolate - try their dark chocolate creamy peanut butter magic. Or buy a bar of their smoky dark chocolate from anywhere south of the states. And the brownie.... brought it home, popped it in the microwave for about 12 seconds and wished I had purchased 3 more. SO DAMN good. 
Get on over there and imbibe in some of the best chocolate around."}
