{"text":"Go here for sure!  If you like Indian food then India Gate in Chandler is a sure stop. They have a daily lunch buffet and dinner buffet on the weekend. They also provide a menu from which to order.  My husband and I love to eat here ...we usually opt for the dinner buffet as it makes for an instant dinner and it is very reasonably priced. Also the food is really flavorful and delicious!  The always have a variety of non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes available which is really convenient as I lean towards a vegetarian diet whenever I have the option. My husband - a born carnivore - prefers the complete opposite.  The service has always been very apt and we have only had good experiences at this restaurant. I know that another India Gate was planned to open at the corner of Higley and Baseline Rd."}
{"text":"Been in for the buffet twice.  Nice selection of food.  Price is good and naan is delicious.  Great service each time we visit."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner, and my taste buds (and endorphins) are still dancing.  I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I went -- it might have prevented me from going.  But that said, my experience on a Sat night at 7:30pm was nothing like most of the other reviews.  Granted, I'm something of a newcomer to Indian food.  My 1/2 dozen experiences  so far have been The Dhaba (Tempe), Guru Palace (Mesa), Star of India (Ahwatukee) plus some other nondescript place.  But tonight, every dish I had was something that I would order again.  As usual to a new place, I had a Groupon.  So I settled for their non-veg dinner option to cover some territory.  I ordered it spicy (out of mild, med, hot, spicy).  The chicken soup was fantastic: a great chix and lentil broth with about 12 chunks of breast chix.  The combo plate had the saag paneer, dhal, chicken curry, chiken tikka masala, and garlic naan.  They also brought me some spicy hot sauce, which I totally devoured.  Hot tea and dessert came with it, plus I had a draft (yes, draft!) Heineken, of which I am a big fan.    Everything seemed hot, fresh, highly tasty, and of very good quality.  I sweated about as much as I might expect (and enjoy), not so much to be unpleasant or intolerable.  Not sure if the \"woods will catch on fire\" or not.  The wait service was relaxed but generally prompt.  Eating by oneself tends to add impatience to the experience.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and plan on going back soon to check out the lunch buffet.  I would suggest that you give it a try, and maybe wait until the middle of the service (lunch or dinner) before showing up.  Oh, and just for the record, the place was about 1/2 full when I got there, and 2 other tables showed after 8pm.  So I do understand the concern about location, but in today's economy, is anywhere really safe?"}
{"text":"I enjoy the lunch buffet here, not a huge selection but enough to make me very full. Great naan bread."}
{"text":"I honestly expected it to be a sad imitation of Indian food in Arizona, and I was wrong! The decor was definitely Indian, the service was friendly, and overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the aesthetic authenticity of the place.   I had their $10.99 buffet, and thought it was really pretty good, but my Indian friends pointed out that it was clearly sub-par, and not made from scratch. I pointed out that it was only 11 dollars, and all-you-can-eat, and we called it even. They had a good selection of different foods, a TV playing the basketball game that was big enough to see, but placed in such a way that it didn't demand attention or take away from the dining.  Honestly, if this place were located in India, it'd be fast food. In a more diverse state, like California or New York, it'd only garner a 2-Star rating. But in Arizona, where Indian food is more scarce than rain, it's a solid 3 stars. I came in and had a good meal for less than 15 dollars, and left. Solid in every respect, and it apparently has all 12 Indian people who live in the state in its employ for added authenticity. I kinda wish the prices were lower, but this ended up working for me.   As an analogy, it's like the El Torito of Indian food. Not as good as it would be if it were made from scratch, or with better ingredients, but clearly a step up from Del Taco. I left feeling alright with everything. Not great, but not underwhelmed, either. If you're in the area, and desperate for Indian food (or if your friends want to eat at the nearby Heart Attack Grill, and you can't stomach the place,) this is a good standby restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid it."}
{"text":"We  tried the buffet here couple of weeks back and man if u need an authentic Indian food please try somewhere else. Food here is more of made-up indian flavour and easy to fool non-indians. To name a few:  carrot halwa was so bland..it was like eating sweetened carrots. where did the mava go? Dal makhani didnt have creamy texture that it should have. Cost cutting, hah! ras malai was like having cold MILK.  The sauce is supposed to be richer  but it was substituted for cheaper version."}
{"text":"WOW, just had some great Indian food. I had the dinner plate, which was an amazing three course meal, which included mughlai soup, followed up by chicken tikka masala, chicken makhni and basmati rice. The flavors were amazing and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh. For desert we had kheer,a type of rice pudding which acted as a great balance after the spice. Overall a great find, I can't wait to eat there again...."}
{"text":"I didn't want to write a review for this place because my husband loves it and I love my husband. However after a recent dose of South Asian food in New York we believe that Phoenix has a lot of catching-up to do. The more we condone the production of greasy fare on dirty plates the more we fall behind. Pull up your socks buddies because soon my newly educated husband will also fall off your patron-list!"}
{"text":"Before dining here, I had never tried Indian cuisine before, so I was very excited to try this place out with my boyfriend (whose an Indian food lover!) We went on a Friday night and the place was calm. Rather cute little place actually. I ordered the Chicken Korma with rice and naan bread, my boyfriend and I both thought it was all delicious but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon. The service was poop, They have a TV in the eating area that seemed to reeeeally be distracting the waiter, because he was so spaced out the entire time, this lady (wife of the owner, maybe?) Kept dashing around yapping on her phone, and the fella behind the bar kept staring when we were obviously done with our meal and were waiting patiently for someone to come by. Eventually he came by and brought us our check, but It was a very awkward atmosphere in general, which is a shame because the food was very good.  Guess it's fine, because I tried making Indian food this weekend and it was a success! I even made naan bread. Yum."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place, and I'm kind of a brat about Indian food. The food isn't the best ever, by any means, but it's always been pretty damn good. The service has always been attentive, friendly and lighthearted- they always make sure that we have a good time. I've never been to their buffet (buffets make me nervous at restaurants where that's not ALL that they do) so I can't comment on the quality there, but my dinners have always seemed fresh and high quality. The ambience is nice and I, personally, found the lighting to be at a nice dim level. The price is good too.  A great place to take first timers who are afraid of Indian food."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner.  Kind service and excellent food.  Really enjoyed the meal and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I just recently had my fourth visit to India Gate for the lunch buffet. I must say the place has grown on me. The selection is large and the food is hot and fresh. The lineup changes often for the buffet but usually consists of a couple curries, masala, a chickpea dish and maybe some goat (which I have yet to try)and rice pudding for dessert.  Service isn't always very friendly or outgoing, but it's all very functional and efficient. Naan is refilled quickly and regularly as are the drinks.  Take time to enjoy the jamming Indian music that is played. You might catch yourself doing some toe tapping. India Gate is a great place for lunch if you want to give Indian cuisine a try or if you're a regular. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was on a date with my daughter, dammit.  Here's how it works:  every other Wednesday each of us takes a daughter out to dinner.  That way we get to have dinner with each of our daughters once a month.  It's a great opportunity to check in -- hopefully they will open up at some point.  Anyway, this time my oldest picked Indian.  I was thrilled.  Usually they both pick Chinese and, much as I like it, it does get tiresome.  Meanwhile, back at the review, we ordered the meat appetizer.  This had a couple kinds of chicken, a meat samosa and lamb kabob.  It was fine, not bad, not brilliant.  My daughter got chicken tikka masala, her favorite.  I tried a ginger kabob at the waiter's suggestion.  These, too, were fine.  No fine dining but not bad.  At this point I didn't realize that they nickel and dime you so I was still oblivious as to what this mediocre food was going to cost me.  Then we went to the bathroom.  We were nearly done and my daughter asked me to accompany her.  That's where we saw it -- the cockroach.  It was easily an inch long before you got to the antenna.  To be fair it was dead.  But at some point it had been alive and had had plenty of time to grow oddly large.  Now I realize that I'm new to PHX and there are palmetto bugs here but I used to live in an old brownstone in the city and I know a cockroach when I see it.  It was right under the empty toilet paper dispenser.  I told the waiter that the toilet paper dispenser was empty, hoping that he'd see the roach and know that I saw it.  I paid the bill and left, intent on warning yelpers everywhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tiki masala. The service was friendly. Not the most kid friendly, but we made it work. I liked the presentation of the food, but it seemed a little expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Very good lunch specials! I went here for dinner and had a great meal. I will definitely come back to try some more new, delicious meals."}
{"text":"I decided to get some take out at India Gate during my lunch break. I was really hoping for a great (or even just good) meal since I love Indian food, and it's so close to my work. Unfortunately, my dish did nothing for me.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering veggie korma since the version at my favorite place, Royal Taj, is sublime. I knew Indian Gate wouldn't be able to outdo them, but the lackluster version that I had tonight really missed the mark. Korma is supposed to be creamy, buttery, and yellow. This was more like a tomato-based veggie stew. I really disliked the presence of zucchini and whole cashews in the dish, but it was edible when paired with the not-so-garlicky garlic naan.  Final price? $14. Way too steep to give it another try."}
{"text":"In Phoenix, there are essentially 3 types of Indian restaurants. None of the restaurants in the valley can compare to good ones in real cities but there are some good ones: Royal Taj, Guru Palace, Dehli Palace. Then there are tolerable ones: India Palace, Tandoori Times, Indian Paradise and then there is everything else (places you shouldn't go to).  India Gate is one of these places.  I'm Indian and we tend to be picky about which Indian restaurants we eat at. Just like you wont find a Sicilian at the Olive Garden, yoy won't find a Desi at India Gate unless they work at Intel and are too lazy to drive to a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"I came for teh lunch buffet and was really impressed. The food was delicious and service was pleasant and quick. The lunch rush starts around noon, so arriving at 11:30 was perfect to be in and out in less than an hour. Lots of vegetarian options and the naan was incredible!"}
{"text":"A BIG NO!!!!!!  At least count this cry as this review comes from an Indian taste bud.  This place serves food with really misplaced spices.  It is home made food gone wrong but sold.  We (me and my husband) went to this place to try with a groupon (lucky that i saved some).  We ordered Veggie Samosa as appetizer and Matar Paneer with Naan for main course. While waiting for food we got fritters as complimentary starter but soon we realized that these fritters come from the remains of lunch buffet kept still HOT.  Moving on we waited for our appetizer which we were hoping to be a bit fresh but also came with rubbery wrap instead of crunchy. Then arrived our main order which was mere a broth (used for tomato soup) curry in which uncooked frozen peas & Paneer which altogether can never be recognized as Authentic matar paneer .  Finally 1 star for Naan cuz it was the best thing i could have there. But this is not climax.  I could have never written this review until this part of my story happened. We had ordered 2 plain Naans for 1.75 each. They cost us 1.99 per naan. It is not about some extra pennies we paid. it is about - we have seen it and asked the lady about the cost of Naan, her blunt reply was  \"yes!! Naan is 1.99 each!\"   This could have been mistake and could have been corrected but standing by their mistake was wrong. Now we have decided never to go back.  Dont Go!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. But I dont know much about Indian food. It was better than the only other place I've been too which had dirty grey chicken in its dishes. Taste was good."}
{"text":"Coming from Asian background I won't and can't turn down any other ethnic food especially Indian when a lot of our foods are similar, just the spices are different. Been here a few times, first time I had their chicken curry dish, which was good. The last few times I had the lunch and dinner buffet. Decided to go with the buffet because its cheaper and you get more food. Just can't take it home. All food selection at the buffet is quite tasty.   The only bad thing is that both lunch and dinner buffet is the same food selection. No different dishes. And also the last few times we went there is the same dishes. Nothing new. But whenever we crave for a simple Indian we will stop here. It's my BF's and I Indian eating spot."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night with a Groupon and no high expectation, and this place turn out really good. I ordered the Tandoori Chicken, Saag Shrimp, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice and Mango Lassi. All delicious... the food did not take long, but the service was slow. Only 1 waiter so I hope they can hire someone quick you will need to give good service to keep the restaurant running. :-)  Next time I will try their dinner buffet..."}
{"text":"We dined here again with friends on Saturday 7/29/2012. Our small group has dined here many, many times in the past years. My wife and I have also dined here many times by ourselves. This time we noticed a big, BAD change. :(  It appears that India Gate was sold and the new owners are ruining it. Yes, there were stains on our table cloth. My wife and I arrived first, then our friends arrived.  Our group + my wife & I never partake in the Buffet--it's kept warm and very mild to appeal to newcomers, We ordered and about 20 or so minutes latter our food arrived. All of the ordered food was served BUT we couldn't eat it. Why? NO plates!   Our items were ordered with a medium level of spice. But the items were BLAND and not very tasty! A very bad sign! Our friends both ordered the same item but there were big differences between the two items. One was greasy and the other was dry. One had a breast of chicken, while the other didn't.  I ordered #17 chicken ginger kabah with medium spice level. It was bland, no real ginger taste. The Pulao Rice, #93 was just so-so-meaning not like before. I think that this was our last visit here as it changed in a bad way. Service at the table also has taken a dive---no plates and took a while to get them! Sad to say, it's time to say goodbye!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited India Gate. The service was as good as the last time we were there. The waiters are attentive and friendly, willing to explain in detail what and how each dishes were made (for those of us who has no idea what some of the items are on the menu)  Cozy place to have a nice meal, reasonable price."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the trip to India gate restaurant in chandler was a waste of time. The only good thing was that we had a buy one get one free coupon. The staff stood at the bar and stared the entire meal. They even brought us items off of the buffet... and we didn't order the buffet. i expected my food to be freshly prepared... all of it. even the naan. Maybe we hit them on a bad night. None-the-less, we wont be back."}
{"text":"I went to India Gate with my boyfriend and had a great experience. The interior design was pleasant, the music was energetic, and the servers were extremely nice and helpful. We ordered paneer pakora as our appetizer and cheese naan. Both were undoubtedly delicious. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered the Merlot while I got the Cabernet Shiraz Indian wine they offered. The Indian wine was a real treat and the Merlot wasn't too bad itself. I don't remember exactly what my boyfriend got for his main dish but it contained shrimp and he loved it. My main course was the vegetarian dinner: Soup, two curries, daal maharani, rice, raita, naan, and kheer. While everything tasted perfect, my favourite was definitely the vegetable soup which consisted of lentils, numerous vegetables, and just the right amount of spices and herbs."}
{"text":"I'm still on a buffet binge and Indian food sounded like a nice change of pace.  After driving around \"the hood\" aka the 24th St. and Thomas area after a meeting today, I was unable to find a suitable buffet.  So, I headed back to Chandler.  I thought I remembered driving by an Indian restaurant on Chandler Blvd. at one point and was pleasantly surprised when I found India Gate.  The atmosphere is sort of cozy ethnic,and  reminds me of the Bay Area .  I was seated quickly and I thought the service was friendly considering the language barrier.  I was impressed by the selections on the lunch buffet and thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.  The food was hot, fresh and with what appeared to be good quality meat (tried lamb curry and chicken vindaloo) and the heat factor was moderate.  The best part about the meal with the garlic naan....pure carb heaven.   It's $9.99 which is somewhat higher than some other buffets at lunch, but I felt the overall experience was well worth it."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet here today.  It wasn't bad, and it was better than an Indian place I tried in Ahwatukee two weeks ago.  The rice, Dahl, Garlic naan, and ground lamb were all good.  The Chicken korma was a bit bland for my taste and the sauce was pretty thin.  The pakoora was a little tough as was the gulab jamin.  Overall, not bad, I would eat here again, but I will continue to search for a better indian place in the East Valley.  The lunch buffet was $10.91 with tax, service was decent.  c"}
{"text":"good food overall, $10 for lunch is over my budget but the naan rocks (garlic and parsley flecks)   our 4y/o ate free!   good stuff"}
{"text":"OMG!  I would have never thought that I would find the BEST Indian food ever in Gilbert AZ. My husband and I went for for dinner this past Sunday and when we walked into a totally empty restaurant, we were worried.    However, our fear was unnecessary.  The wait person jokingly referred to himself as \"Prince Ali\" and could not have been more helpful.  He thoroughly explained the appetizers and asked us questions to lead us to the right dinners choices. We ordered Samosas and some kind of fried cheese as appetizers.  They were just fair. The entrees were something else completely.  My husband had Saag Lamb - very tender chunks of lamb in what was more like a spicy spinach sauce rather than spinach as a side dish per se.  I can't recall the menu name of what I ordered but it was shrimp in a butter/yogurt sauce, with medium spice.  Outstanding!  We ordered rice with vegetables on the side - basmati rice with bits of  veggies and some spices, maybe saffron.  You would not believe how delicious it was!  Also, don't forget the naan.  Order more to take home for tomorrow. Seriously, if you are a fan of Indian food, or are trying it for the first time, RUN, do not walk, to India Gate.  Please resist the urge to eat from the buffet. While I have not had it here, my experience is the food is too generic.  Read the menu, decide how spicy you want it and get it the way you like it."}
{"text":"It was a different kind of fare, but it was really good! My girlfriend ordered hers spicy (on a scale of 1-10, she ordered a 6, I was more conservative and ordered mine a 3).   Megan and I are on a \"world food tour\" and and this was Stop #2 on our list.   The place is kind of hidden from view, but it is located on Higley and Baseline, hidden right near the Fitness Works in the back of the complex somewhat. The place is VERY clean, and the lady who works there, seems like she is the owner, is VERY NICE! She was very courteous, and was very professional.   I do not know why others seemed like they had so much trouble with Groupon offers, I have used mine with no issues at all, in fact, she said that over 400 had purchased Groupons already, and her business has been doing a lot better thanks to it! She was very grateful that we came in, and she was very attentive to our needs in the restaurant.  Now indian food, isn't for everyone, it is kind of heavy, and strong, so be prepared. If you know what you're in for, it is really good. Our food wasn't cold either like others have stated, rather it was fresh, and hot right out of the kitchen, and very tasty. The Indian Chicken Soup is to die for, and is a great start to the meal.   The only part that is bad would be the fact that the food is kind of expensive, which thankfully we had the Groupon offer to help offset the cost. Without the Groupon, you would be looking at spending about upwards of $60 + Tip for a simple dinner for two.  I do recommend this place to anyone looking to try out a new place to eat, and it is definitely good food!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine.  I love that they serve both a dinner and lunch buffet.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is amazing. Once they didn't have it on the buffet but they brought me an order from from the kitchen since they knew I was disappointed about it not being on the buffet that night.  I didn't even ask.  How's that for service?"}
{"text":"Delicious great  food accepts restaurant.com coupons but you really don't need them as the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is steadily declining. Been a long time customer (10 plus years). The service and the selection is dwindling. The meat is not fresh or it's over cooked. I  purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate, and they refused to honor it accordingly AND assessed an automatic 18% gratuity to the bill. (I did the buffet. PLEASE!) I won't be returning to this restaurant again. You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"The review is for the buffet only. I visit often since it is near my workplace.  The food is just all right but lacks the variety. I wish they add a few more dishes (like seafood or lamb) rather than those tasteless sweets."}
{"text":"Let's see, yummy , yummy, yummy and , yummy.  What else can I say.  I'm a sucker for Indian food and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We've been to many Indian food spots in the past but this is by far our favorite. The food is always on point and we are always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"I was staaarving today at lunchtime so when my husband suggested the Indian buffet, I was so down! Everything was really good, I haven't had vegetable pakoras in years, so yummy. The only thing I'd say was lacking is the decor. The first room you walk into is fine, but then there is another huge room, that's half empty. It's kinda weird.   I'm happy to hear that they are going to start offering a dinner buffet starting in September. The waiter also said that the dinner buffet will offer more variety that lunch, including some seafood. YAY."}
{"text":"Last week I had this mad hankering for some Indian food and I thought I would give the India Gate a try since it's right down the street from my office.  It's a pretty typical Indian buffet; they have Indian rice, chicken curry, chicken tandoori, ground lamb, and enough vegetables to satisfy any of your vegan friends looking for a buffet.  I went as soon as they opened at 11:00 and everything was hot and fresh.  Service was decent, I didn't understand a word they said but they brought me naan without requesting it and kept my water glass full.  I wouldn't say this place blew my skirt up or would win any awards, but if you are looking for a quick scoot in and scoot out for some Indian food, it will suffice.  Quick tip: go out to their website to get the coupon for the lunch buffet before you go."}
{"text":"This place is a good lunch option. Let me first start of by saying I have only been there for lunch a few times and never dinner. The buffet had some good choices but not so good variety. The taste however was more then there. The spice was just how I like it. The nann was very good and what you would expect. Price is reasonable and competitive. Service was good"}
{"text":"We got a groupon deal and decided to try out this place. I went on a Sunday. There are on one other table beside us. We thought that is not a good sign.  I ordered lamb. It was good, but not fantasy. When the bill come, it was a little more expensive than I thought. Oh, I forgot to mentioned their dish doesn't come with rice or bread. I have been eating Asian food all the time. What kind of Asian dish doesn't come with rice. I will not return even with groupon."}
{"text":"Decent buffet, chicken can sometimes be dry. I like the way they make their naan"}
{"text":"This is like the 4th Indian food review I'm writing in one night...So, I'll make a rubric:  for the buffet: Naan: indian food staple - 5 star Tandoori chicken: another indian food staple - 5 star curry selection: bleh, i'm a little picky, it was a decent selection -3 star desserts: decent selection, gulab jamun was good, not a fan of the other stuff - 4star service: good  by the way, i just made the cardinal sin of referring to curry as 'curry'. there is no such thing. qorma, tikka, salan, etc are all your 'curry' dishes, but they are all very different and using those words makes it much more apparent as to what you can expect from the sauce.  decent indian food if you're in AZ. the search continues for some indian food that compares to the stuff you get in cali."}
{"text":"No surprises here at this simple buffet. For $7.99 you can pig out on various vegetable dishes, chicken entrees, salad, and sweets like gulab jamun and carrot halwa.  The buffet was pretty basic. They had your standard dishes you'd see at an Indian buffet such as vegetable korma, chicken tikka masala, a saag (spinach) dish, and some dark meat tandoori chicken. They also had a tray of chicken vindaloo, a bright red dish with spicy heat!   Unfortunately, the dishes were lacking in that certain \"punch\" that makes Indian food, when done right, so remarkable. The vegetable korma was a little runny in consistency, and seemed to consist mainly of potatoes and not much else. Same could be said for the vindaloo. I couldn't really find any pieces of chicken in it, just potato. The chicken tikka masala was OK, but nothing really too impressive. There was also a tray of veggie pakora and basmati rice. I enjoyed the veggie pakora the most out of all the savory dishes. There were a lot of veggies packed into the fritter, fried until tender with a tasty batter. I also enjoyed the fresh garlic naan brought to the table.   There was also a salad area, condiments such as raita and chutney, and some dessert. Out of the two desserts (carrot halwa and gulab jamun), I liked the gulab jamun the most. It had that nice tender cake-like texture that the dish typically has, soaked in some sweet syrup.  Soda fountain drinks are $1.99 and consist of coke products.  The buffet for lunch is from Monday through Friday. The saving grace of the meal was the price point. Since it was just $7.99, I wasn't too disappointed that my meal consisted of mainly potatoes in various curries, rather than a multitude of various meats and veggies."}
{"text":"It always perplexes me when one restaurant fails and another one comes along and opens the exact same kind of restaurant that just failed in that location. Often, as in this case with the same type of cuisine. My wife and I went here to try out our Groupon deal. The decor is very nice and the food is actually really good. I suspect however, that they will be out of business fairly quickly. We went on a weeknight and when we arrived, there was only one couple there at 7pm. We sat down and ordered but only one other couple came in the entire time we were there. Again, the food was really good. Here's the problem; the prices, portion size and their ala carte menu arrangement. I have NEVER been to an Indian restaurant where rice and/or naan bread was not included with a dinner entree. Not only is it not included here, but they charge $3 for a side of either. The lady who waited on us was one of the owners. While she was courteous, she never once smiled, thanked us for coming or tried to engage us in conversation. At the end of our meal, when she found out that we had a Groupon voucher, she was visibly irritated. You can see in some of the photos I have posted the portion size, which in my estimation was about a 4 inch bowl. Quite small in comparison to other Indian restaurants we regularly patronize. My wife had the lamb dish and it was $13, while my fish entree was $12. Although the food was good, sadly, we will not return. There are just more negatives than positives."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but this place just sets the bar...I've tried several similar locations in town, but this place is the best in my opinion. Their garlic nan is well seasoned and just the right texture, their lamb curry has great flavor without letting the heat do all the work and their dinner sampler selection is lovely. Each side dish on the platter was great to sample. Their tables are small and cozy and they also feature a buffet though me and the hubby chose to just dine-in with service. This place is a must try. Also, Groupon featured these guys for a great deal which made the experience thrifty as well as tasty ;)"}
{"text":"Lamb was tough, chicken was dry, the sauces were too oily.  Decently flavored sauces and the soup was very nice, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Indian at a good price.  Garlic naan was very good as was the Chicken curry and Tandoori chicken.  Desserts were pretty decent as were the saag paneer, malai kofta and beef vindaloo.  Can't beat the $8 weekday lunch buffet price which includes masala tea."}
{"text":"Closed for the week the day before Thanksgiving...you have got to be kidding me. Next stop, guru palace. I check it out eventually."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Service was good. That's about all. They are pricy ($40 for two people and small portions) and they either overcharged or charge for all parts of the meal (ie rice). All in all, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Only been there a couple of times, but the food has been consistently good.  Not great but good.  Prices were reasonable and the staff has been attentive.  Worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"I'm starting to get the hang of Indian food, and as George Costanza would say: \"I'm Loving It !\".  So when a friend suggested an Indian buffet, I was all over it.  India Gate is great, not pretentious or over the top, with a good sized menu, oh but I didn't want the menu Georgie, I wanted the buffet.  It had all of my favorites like palak paneer and matter paneer, plus some new favorites like the minced lamb and green chutney.  I love their lunch buffet and stop by at least twice a month, but I was unimpressed with the lamb vindaloo entree from the menu. The lamb was tough and had gristle. Boo Gristle... Hooray Beer!"}
{"text":"Cold food at 11:45 buffet. Will never go back.  Watery as hell Tikka Masala and butter chicken.if you're used to the chandler location this one is nothing like it. Different recipes altogether.  Skip this is you like Real Indian food.  Might change my review if they actually invited me back for some HOT food. Im upset I did not leave."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Indian food, but as a newbie to the Valley, I wasn't quite sure where to get my vegetable korma fix. I mentioned this in passing to one of my coworkers, and he emphatically suggested India Gate, saying it was the best Indian food he has had in Valley, even after conducting a lengthy but informal taste test of the Valley's other Indian offerings. He then warned me that it would look like a hole-in-the-wall, with a secluded location within a Chandler shopping center.    So, when I had a particularly powerful hankering for Indian food one night, I decided to make the trip from north Tempe to west Chandler to check out this place once and for all.  And I wasn't disappointed. This is, indeed, a gem of a restaurant.  I decided on the bhindi masala, which is okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices. I am a big fan of okra, which, sadly, doesn't seem to make it onto many restaurant menus. My dish was incredibly flavorful and one of the most memorable of the year. I have since returned to try India Gate's malai kofta (vegetable dumplings in an incredible cheese sauce,  vegetable korma,  veggie fried rice, bengan bharta and samosas. Everything has proved to be delicious.  However, the restaurant is not without its drawbacks. The service I've received has been awkward at best, if not a touch rude. Also, many on the serving staff speak with thick Indian accents that I found hard to understand. Once, I even received the garlic naan instead of the plain naan because I couldn't understand my waiter when he was repeating my order back to me. For some, I realize that would be a pretty cool mistake, but garlic gives me heartburn surely invented by El Diablo himself. I would go here even more often if it weren't for the communication barrier.  Like my coworker, I highly recommend this place as one of the Valley's tastiest., even when considering the less than desirable service I've received there. It's a particularly great place for take-out; there's even a coupon for 15 percent off take-out orders on its website."}
{"text":"This is for the lunch buffet, food is pretty good but not a lot of variety.  They have the same items almost everyday.  I really like their Naan.  If you use credit card, check your account.  We were charged twice.  I called and asked to have it corrected.  The person took my number but didn't do anything about it."}
{"text":"Ah very good. I love the biriyani with lamb and chicken.....Lamb curry wasn't bad either. The garlic naan was on par. Oh also it seems they have shrimp and beef curry.....nomnomnomnom.   Wait I thought the cow was holly.....nomnomnomnom."}
{"text":"This place is good for a quick scoff and run. The food is pretty decent (the Chicken Tikka Masala has never let me down here) although their onion Bhajis need some work and the service is usually prompt and efficient. Don't come for atmosphere though, talk about over lit! It's like eating under the spotlights of an evening sports event."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is rockin'. Since we were practically the only ones there on a Tuesday, I asked him to spice it up on the dishes and they did! Everything was delicious! The reason I'm not giving India Gate 5 stars is because they're a bit over priced for most Indian food places in town by like 2 dollars on their main dishes, but other than that great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I went back to India Gate recently and was delighted!  I swear the taste and quality of everything has improved, as has the service.  Our servers were all very attentive, though not pushy.  Everything was excellent; my party ate every last bite.  I think the prices may have been reduced, though I'm not certain.  I ordered the same: Paneer Pakora (fried cheese appetizer I highly recommend) and Malai Kofta.  Both are outstanding!  I will be back!  My new favorite Indian cuisine in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Food was good. That being said, the service was so bad it was uncomfortable. The waiter didn't so much as nod at us, rather just came to stand at our table and stare at us. We, assuming he wanted to take our order, gave it, and he grunted and walked away. That's as much communication as we got the whole time, no lie.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Don't have a long history of going to Indian restaurants so I really can't compare to other places, but I do know the food was fantastic! Restaurant was fairly quiet with occasional people coming in to pickup their take-out orders."}
{"text":"To sum up the food experience, i have to say that i've had better.  I went to try out their lunch buffet.  The restaurant was clean as it was still showing the Grand Opening sign out front.  The buffet options was not very impressive.  They had veg. pakora (cold) and no samosa's.  Their meat options were Chicken Tikka Masala which was very dissapointing.  It was a tomato base with absolutely no spices.  It could have used some garam masala and some ginger and other indian spices.  It tasted like tikka masala out of a jar.  It just did not give you a sense of any effort was made.  The tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor.  Again, where is the Indian spices?  The vegetable dishes were saag paneer and dahl fry which were both ok, but no Aloo Gobi??  I have to admit the basmati rice and garlic naan were the best thing there.  Another big disappointment was the Gulab Jamun dessert which was ice cold.  I prefer the honey syrup to be warm....as if it was frozen and just defrosted.   Basically nothing, other than the rice and bread tasted home made.  I will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"Indian food.  Lunch Buffet.  Rice pudding.  Nuff said."}
