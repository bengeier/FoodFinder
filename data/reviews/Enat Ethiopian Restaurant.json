{"text":"I have been to a number of Ethiopian restaurants in Charlotte and prior to coming to Enat, I was ready to give up on the cuisine.  This place is, by far, the best Ethiopian food that I have tried.   The space is very small and unassuming, but clean and neatly decorated.  It is in a little shopping complex off of Plaza.  The menu is smallish, but in a nice touch they give definitions of many of the Ethiopian terms.  There is a cooler in the front with juice, water, and sodas  - no alcohol is sold.  It seemed like the person serving us was an owner/manager as she knew everything about the food and even the Armhaic letters on the wall.  The service was quick as the restaurant was empty when we arrived.  My wife had Kifto 360 which was some sort of spiced meat patty with cream cheese pressed between two tortillas and sliced like a pie.  She absolutely loved it.  As a main dish I had the lamb nibs, while my wife had the vegetarian platter.  Everything came out on one plate, with a side dish of rolled up enjera (slightly sour, spongy bread that you use to pick up the food in lieu of utensils.)  The lamb nibs were excellent and I liked the green beans and cabbage and carrots as well from the vegetarian platter.  The vegetarian platter had 8 different combos so it is great to sample from. Everything was just a touch spicy which was great.  The prices were not super cheap, but very reasonable both for the quality and quantity of food that we got. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice staff, however, I ordered Gomen and it was completely bland. No spices. I didn't go out for Ethiopian food to get tasteless food! Very disappointed to be eating super plain greens."}
{"text":"Enat is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I have eaten here many times and tried much of the menu. You cannot go wrong. The service is also great."}
{"text":"Went here the other week with my friend for lunch! The place looks very standoff-ish from the outside but once you walk in, the place is clean and cozy. The guy working there was super friendly and the food was delicious! We got the veggie sampler platter with beef and it was so good! I will definitely be coming back when I am craving ethiopian food =)"}
{"text":"The food was plentiful and delicious!  The atmosphere was warm and inviting.  The waitress, knowing this was our first time, was so kind, she explained everything, gave recommendations and made our experience very enjoyable.  We had the vegetable platter and beef tibs, both were very good!  We look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Never had Ethiopian food but this was very good! Highly recommend it for anyone that has eaten it before Wise never tried it very good spot"}
{"text":"Love this new Ethiopian cuisine in the Charlotte area! The staff is super friendly, welcoming and attentive to their guests! I throughly enjoyed my experience when I visited a few weeks ago. I highly recommend trying the kitfo Rolls and Goden Tibs! I'll be sure to frequent this establishment and hope they are here for the long haul!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten Ethiopian food before, so when my friend suggested it as our monthly foodie adventure, I figured why not?  There were 15 of us. The staff was courteous and arranged seating to accommodate us. I chose the lamb tibs, shiro stew and enjera. The lamb was cooked to perfection. The sauce is a blend of special spices and seasonings with diced tomatoes, onions & jalepeños. The shiro stew was fantastic. I'm a big fan of chickpeas and this didn't disappoint. The enjera was spongey and slightly bitter. If it was seasoned, it would take away from the complexities of the food. It's a small family business, so I wasn't even upset that my food came out WAY after everyone else's (there were 15 of us). The highlight was Enat (mother) fixing coffee for us. The ceremony was interesting to watch and the aroma from the beans filled the restaurant with a pleasant, smokey ambiance. I'll definitely return, just without 14 other people!"}
{"text":"This was my first Ethiopian restaurant experience and i loved it ! The food was delicious and the owner was so helpful and sweet . I ordered some lamb and fossolia and my boyfriend ordered the Doro Wat and Gomen . We also had some cinnamon tea , which was delightful . Everything is made by hand of course and fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cooked from scratch. A family restaurant, Ethiopian food, healthy, tasty. The service was very personalized and intimate. A great discovery for people who like to taste something new, although I am sure after you trying anybody would go back again and again. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm part of a dinner club that reviews restaurants around Charlotte, and Enat was our pick for the month. No one else in the group had ever experienced Ethiopian food, so this was my pick! The food was amazing: a few people were even eating foods they had placed on their \"don't eat list\" like lamb and beet. The service was excellent. It's a family owned business we were served by the owner who made great recommendations for an authentic experience. Her mother performed a coffee ceremony after the meal that was so enjoyable while her dad told us stories and shared culture. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Craving something different I decided to make the drive over to The Plaza to check out Enat.  I placed my order through the yelp app and headed over.  I ordered the vegetarian combo without the enjera (remembering trying it before and not liking it).  The combo includes 9 samples of their vegan offerings and I was impressed with the majority of of them.  I also ordered the sabusa stuffed with lentils and they were amazing but very spicy and served with a great tasting sauce.  The restaurant is very small in a strip mall with other restaurants and stores.  The staff was very pleasant, and made sure I had everything I needed before leaving.  The size of the platter was pretty huge, even for my takeout order."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great customer service and the food is prepared fresh and fast!   Try the vegetarian plate! A must try"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this first time visit here. When we arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday night, we were the only ones here. It soon became very busy and all the table were full within a matter of 30 minutes and it's obvious why. The food was excellent and the service was personable and friendly. I very much enjoyed the veggie platter which came with an endless amount of injera (spongy like bread). The meal was large and enough for 2 people with smaller appetites. I will be back."}
{"text":"Last night's dining experience was amazing! The owner took the time to welcome us and break down the menu. This was my first time experiencing Ethiopian cuisine. I ordered the vegetarian combo with beef on the side. It was very good and I loved all the spicyness...fresh jalapeños in everything The owner was very helpful in explaining the menu and the service was excellent despite our large group. Everything is made to order and fresh when placed in front of you. All in all, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Enat is amazing, the best Ethiopian food I've had in Charlotte.  Tina, who is the general manager here, came to our table and gave us a great education on Ethiopian food, as well as their coffee traditions.  We need to go back to check out a coffee ceremony, it sounded delicious and fun.  I would highly recommend the Gored Gored which was a crispy beef dish, and GET THE ENJERA!  Not sure how they do theirs, but it was done to perfection and left me craving more."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food and it was great! So flavorful! I had the lamb, chickpea stew, raw beef, and cabbage. They even had ceremonial coffee. I was greeted with warmth and it continued and showed throughout my service. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Very welcoming environment, delicious food, great service, happy people. We'll definitely return. Don't forget to try the coffee and please don't add cream or sugar!"}
{"text":"My partner and I recently moved to the Charlotte area, and we love Ethiopian food. We were so happy with our experience at Enat. We split the vegetarian platter for two (it was huge). The meal included a great variety of items (cold and warm). The service was excellent and the place was cozy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Everything we ate on the vegetarian combo was top notch. Service and decor were similar; humbly tasteful. Very cool authentic looking (I am no expert) Ethiopian art in a simple, colorful cafe environment. The food was so good we decided to take another veg combo to go. Highly recommend this spot to lovers of exotic food."}
{"text":"Amazingly authentic Ethiopian cuisine!! Great service, very clean. Great for Vegans too! Very well seasoned with all the trimmings."}
{"text":"I'm still new to the Ethiopian food scene, but I am so glad I went to Enat! The staff was beyond helpful, I was honest with them and told them that I'd only had Ethiopian a couple of times prior and asked for some guidance through the menu.  First thing, they highly recommended we move to a larger table (due to the Ethiopian style playing and their portion sizes) even though there was just two of us - Good Call!  I had lamb Tibs - per the staff's recommendation - that was insanely well-flavored and I couldn't stop with the Injera!   After trying our hardest to eat everything on the table, we had to throw in the towel, but, I'll be back!   Enat was a great experience. I was very happy with the hospitality of the staff and that coupled with the delicious food and the portion sizes easily make this a 5-Star eatery!  If you are a long time fan of Ethiopian, or new to it. Go to Enat, ask for recommendations and sit back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I loved this little place. The staff was wonderful. The food was authentic and the flavors were great. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"It was cold and I was lazy so I got food from Enat delivered via Postmates. It came fast and everything was at the right temp and delicious. Since it was my first order I tried a few things -- awaze lamb tibs, with fasolia (green beans and carrots) and the beet and potato side added on. Plus some extra injera, because who doesn't need extra injera?  That's definitely enough for two full on meals so don't get carried away with your order unless you like leftovers. The awaze tibs was super flavorful and spicy but not overpowering. The beet and potato was really good -- I've never seen that dish at an Ethiopian place before but it is my new favorite. The injera was springy and fresh, probably some of the best I've had in this town. Only complaint is that the container let the ater mix completely with the awaze tibs because the delivery person didn't keep it flat, but it was delicious anyway. I can only imagine it will be much better right out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I was immensely impressed and satisfied with the food and services at this restaurant. Their fish tibs is one of my favorite. It's cooked perfectly and goes well with their rice as well as enjera. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Amazing service and delicious food. I'd recommend having the cinnamon tea after your meal too. That was so relaxing."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience with Ethiopian food, and it did not disappoint! I had the chicken tibs, and the vegetarian platter. Split with a friend and we both still took leftovers home! Great amount of food for the price, and the coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Really good food prepared at a family own restaurant! This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food. I really appreciated the owner coming out to explain the cuisine and cultural way of dining :-) Given eating with my hands was a bit new to me, I was happy to see silverware offered if I really wanted it. The chicken tibs is definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the staff are awesome and very accommodating. It's both a good thing and a bad thing that it takes me half an hour to drive here. If they were closer to me I would be eating here all the time."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a month if not more. The enat special is amazing!!! I recommend the Golden tibs or the Derek tibs. Also the kitfo is perfect!!! Everything is good."}
{"text":"First time ever eating Ethiopian... and it was amazing!  The food was delicious and plentiful!  My wife and kids loved it too!  Great place for vegetarians like us!"}
{"text":"This was amazing Ethiopian food. We ordered through Postmates and when it got here it was still hot and still delicious so I can only imagine how good it would be fresh from the kitchen in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Highly recommended-try the lamb tibs. Unbelievably good. I am from Chicago and my wife is African so we know good Ethiopian. This is it. Really like the whole place."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for something different, homemade and made with absolute love!? ENAT Ethiopian Restaurant is the best Move! I had the Veggie platter and it was AMAZING! Ethiopian cuisine is one of my favorite types of cuisines and Enat delivered the best IVE HAD IN ALL MY 24years of LIFE!!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Charlotte for the holidays. I did a quick search for Ethiopian food and found my way to Enat. Really great food. I ordered the veg. combo as a carry-out order. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I am staying in an Airbnb place nearby and Enat is the closest restaurant so I figured I'd give it a try. I don't know much about Ethiopian food so I kept my order simple and ordered the lamb sandwich and an order of tikel gomen, which I looked up on Google...it's a cabbage dish which is really tasty and almost reminds of something Eastern European. The sandwich itself was really excellent! It came in a nice hoagie roll with a delicious side salad. Now I want to do some more adventures in Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian cuisine. This place is the best Ethiopian cuisine I've had in the city. The food is fresh and delicious. I had the veggie combo and my wife had the lamb tibs. Omg the lamb was so juicy. My veggie combo was great. About eight different selections on my plate. Not oily and very tasty. We loved it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Everything is Great! I've tried it all! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of about 15 for a monthly foodie outing and we had a great time. The place is really small and we practically took over the place. But the owner took great care of us and even walked us through the menu and gave us background information on the restaurant & it's name. The vegetarian combo with lamb on the side was delicious with the array of spices & the lamb was cooked to perfection. Everything is made fresh to order so everyone's plate came out as it was done. I don't think there was a person at the table that didn't enjoy their dish. The owners mother even came out and performed a coffee ceremony for us and it was a nice end to our meal. I will definitely be back!"}
