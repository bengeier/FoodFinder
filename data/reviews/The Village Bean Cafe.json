{"text":"I've been coming here regularly all summer and I couldn't be happier. They make one of the best cold brews I've ever had, and their pastry selection is great. Outstanding service - Judy is always wonderful. Love that this gem is in the heart of Olmsted Falls! My only \"complaint\" is their limited hours. I wish they were open a couple hours later (they'd get a great crowd of high school students), and open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Stopped in while we were passing through town looking for a quick snack.  This is definitely my kind of coffee shop.  The space was clean and modern, and the chairs looked comfortable and not too close together.  They had a nice selection of muffins and pastries.  I would love to go back with a newspaper and relax for a couple hours.  They don't appear to have an actual website, but they do have a Facebook page.  Yelp isn't letting me link to it for some reason though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee when I had some time to kill between my work visits.  Was greeted by a nice server named Judy.  Received a great cafe latte.  Such a good coffee for small coffee shop.  Desserts looked great.  Cute and clean."}
{"text":"I stopped in to the Village Bean Cafe to kill some time before a wedding and was very delighted!  There was one employee, but she gave me her absolute full attention.  She made me a delicious Salty Caramel Mocha and made sure it was exactly to my expectations--even explaining the differences in syrups that they use versus what Starbucks uses.  Since I was the only one in the shop, she then talked to me quite a bit and was very friendly.  She knew I was just killing time and showed me a great deal of hospitality, even 30 minutes prior to close.    The atmosphere is comfortable and community-centric, which was perfect for this cute local shop."}
{"text":"Outstanding small local coffee shop in Olmsted Falls. I ordered a cold brew/iced coffee.  Drink was strong and tasty! Pretty cool little coffee shops! Lots of interior seating to sit, enjoy your coffee, hang out, and work! Folks here were friendly and very nice!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot!  Good coffee, working wifi, QUIET and a real hometown feel. A great alternative to the big Green chain."}
{"text":"We come here a few times a month. Coffee is delicious and provide warm mugs to drink. Judy is awesome and will warm up your pastry if you ask her too. Great place to chill!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would, but because of service as I didn't even get to try the product. I went to The Village Bean today to get a drink. I walked in and there were only 2 people sitting at a table. They seemed like regulars as the cashier/employee was talking to them. She came over to wait on me and acted as though I had inconvenienced her. I looked at the menu, ordered a mocha and then asked if she had skim milk. She sort of huffed/made a grunting noise and said yes reluctantly. So she proceeds to make my drink. I look at the gallon of milk she brought out and noticed that it was expired. She brought out another full gallon after and set it next to the first one on the counter. I assumed she was going to throw away the expired milk and use the new gallon, but then she proceeded to pour it into my mocha. So I asked her if I could see the milk, she flashed it at me, trying to not show the expiration date, I asked her to tilt it so I could see the date. I told her it was expired. She again huffed/grunted and walked towards the back to throw it away and said it's still good in a harsh/disgruntled voice. She then brought a different full gallon from the back and stated that the new gallon was also expired. So I said to forget about it and just walked out. Probably the worst customer service I have ever received. She was incredibly rude the entire time, never even flashed a bit of a smile and then tried to serve me expired milk."}
{"text":"This is a really nice, chill coffee shop in the Cleveland area. Good amount of space, home made pastries and good espresso. Definitely recommend."}
