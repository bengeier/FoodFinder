{"text":"24 hours and amazing food, I love to stop by. They have an amazing staff.

On my last visit I had a Ruben sandwich and I devoured it! The chicken wings were amazing too."}
{"text":"Re-visited the Lucky Penny on 9/30/17 and so glad we did. I  can see major improvement that deserves high praise.  The general manager, Freshta Soltero is concerned that each person's dining experience is a very positive one.   She has managed to greatly improve the chef's attention to the quality of the food as well as the wait staff's attentiveness to the guests.  Our waiter Arturo, and the shift manager Camila were as pleasant and helpful as they could have been.  Both were very personable and attentive. I hope we see them on our next visit!
If you go there you must try the Maine Lobster Roll which is one of the best I've ever had.  The freshness of the lobster and the perfectly toasted bun were fantastic. Perfectly spiced and a large serving with fries.  I tried the Old Fashioned Cherry Bombe milkshake and it was great.  So many cherry pieces and spiked with bourbon!  My husband enjoyed the freshness of the hummus on the Mezzo Board Small Plate.  He also had a Dirty Burger that was HUGE with pieces of pork belly on it.  It was very good. Both entrees were perfectly cooked.  Our favorite was the Small Plate of Zin Braised Meatballs.  This was absolutely fantastic!  We did not have desserts simply because we were full.  
There are many interesting small plates and entrees to be tried on a return trip.  The menu is innovative and has interesting twists on comfort food items such as meatloaf and potato soup.  Continued success, Freshta!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  I was really hoping to like this newly remodeled cafe.  I had a food comp so I figured I'd give this new place a try.  Only ordered 2 appetizers -Chicken Wings and the Mezze Board (hummus platter).  It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and when it did the chicken wings were cold.  They tasted ok, not true Buffalo style - very saucy (sweet BBQ?).

The Mezze platter was fine but had only about a half dozen pita wedges.  I asked for more pita and was told no problem.  Took another 15-20 minutes to get the extra 6-8 pita wedges.  Waitress did not tell me it was an add'l $2!

Overall the place is bright and clean and the food was acceptable.  However, I think the $27 for 2 appetizers and 2 soft drinks is a bit expensive.  Fortunately I had that $15 comp!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place to get lunch! The grilled cheese was to die for and the decor is beautiful. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Lucky Penny was amazing. We ate here two days in a row for lunch! The first day the service was a bit slow, but the food was worth the wait! My husband had the cinnamon swirl pancakes, my son had American Breakfast, and I had chicken tenders, and a Cesar salad. Everything was delicious! I love that breakfast and lunch is served all day. The second day Andy was our server and he was AMAZING. So kind and gracious, you can tell he loves where he works and takes pride in the food. We would come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Came in today at 11:35 and left at 12:45pm. It took a total of 15 minutes to get drinks and place an order. Waitress was never in sight and had to ask mgt for cream for the coffee after waiting for her which there actually only  had fat free milk and they no longer had regular cream. Food came at 12:10pm. We order the breakfast pizza...american breakfast and chicken and biscuit,also side of pancakes. All food was bland. Hash browns were round shaped patties that we soft and bland no flavor. Chicken was actually ok and not dry. Pancakes were very dense and dry.In all we will not be back. Very dissapointing.70 dollars total spent.We could have spent half the money at blueberry hill and had better service and food."}
{"text":"Lucky Penny is a fantastic, much needed new addition to the Palms! We own a condo at Palms Place and definitely needed a new good casual restaurant to go to. The food is delicious and very reasonable. There are a ton of options- breakfast whenever, lunch, dinner, juices, dessert. I only so far had two egg dishes- the eggsadilla and the Ratatouille frittata but both were so delicious! The decor is really nice and trendy too."}
{"text":"Brick oven chicken with 2 fried eggs on top \"The beginning and End\"!!!! If I were on death row this would be my last meal.  Great Staff and service, I WILL BE BACK AGAIN!

Ask to sit in Michelle's section, OUTSTANDING JOB!!!"}
{"text":"Try the waffle grilled cheese sandwich!  It comes with a small cup of tomato soup and that was great too!

Service was awesome. The staff is friendly and extremely attentive.  I like that they are polite to each other.  That says a lot to me!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! I went here at 9am on Wednesday morning. There were maybe 5 tables already seated. When the hostess asked how many in my party she was interrupted by a man asking to speak with the manager. That should have been a red flag but I ignored it because the person I was with really wanted to eat here. I watched as the man waited patiently standing against the wall waiting for a manager for approx. 10 mins. While I watched him wait we were not approached by a server or spoken to by anyone there. After about 10 mins of waiting they sat a couple down behind us. Then another party in another section. I watched the manager greet and dismiss the man against the wall. I waited while food runners walked by our table several times without acknowledgement that we were there. Finally a server came out and went to the party that was seated behind us 10 mins after we got there. When I saw that I flagged down the manager. I informed him that the server just took the drink order of the couple who had just sat down while we waited for 15 mins. Instead of listening he shrugged and said sorry can I take your drink order. I said no these people were just seated and server already helped them and he made some excuse about it getting busy all at once and I told him that didn't happen and he gave another excuse of the hostess not knowing how to seat properly. We walked out and he gave a half hearted apology with a smirk,  I am kicking myself for not getting his name now but the experience we had made us not want to step foot in the palms again because of the restaurant managers lack of caring and we gamble A LOT at the palms casino and we have a president players card. I will not be returning to this restaurant and it might be a while before I go back to this casino."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4.5 stars because our server Charlie was really chill and her energy was great.

Food was great, big portions. However, I was really disappointed at the margherita pizza. It was literally a cheese pizza with like... 3 pieces of basil. Like yo where are the tomato slices? The chunks of mozzarella?? when i asked another server about this, she said the tomatoes were in the sauce (but the pizza is basically a thin crust pizza so ???? where ??¿¿?? pretty sure my fingernail was thicker than that) and mozzarella was shredded in there. was severely disappointed by that. 

Actual restaurant was clean and brightly lit, but there were a couple times where the lights flickered as if the power was about to shut off.

Service. Like I said, Charlie was great. But there was one thing that bothered me: none of the other servers were attentive. I observed other tables around us and literally none of the servers would respond when a table needed something. Even though our server was great, she spent at least 15-20 minutes at one table. The other servers popped around here and there but dude. I get that its not busy but at least show that you're paying attention to your customers. Even if they're not seated at your tables, don't brush someone off if they need something (this happened to five tables, including ours. we counted.)"}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Saturday late morning. Not too busy was able to be seated right away. The lighting is very bright. Especially at the bar where we sat. They have bar top lamps with phone plug ins. Outlets are nice but can do without the light. Service was good. 

We ordered the Eggsadilla & breakfast pizza. Eggsadilla is a quesadilla with egg, cheese & poblano peppers. I got it with egg whites that were very fluffy & plentiful The bottom of the quesadilla was soggy plus there was not have a lot of peppers in it but it was still pretty tasty. The pizza was fabulous. Sausage,sage,mornay sauce, egg & potatoes. Delicious. 

Prices were reasonable. Overall good place to stop by."}
{"text":"Went here when we stayed  at the palms . It was around midnight.  The service was great and I was very surprised with my Mongolian beef. It was delicious. The prices are great the food is tasty and to top it off great service."}
{"text":"I'm on a movie time crunch and in dire need of a super quick and wholesome meal. It's a good thing this restaurant is near the movie theater and is open 24 hours. I have previously tried a couple desserts from their display case and I really like the Chocolate Chip Cookie, it's seriously addictive. Now this is my first time dining in and trying to decide what to get on the menu. Thankfully our server is quite attentive and well-versed with recommendation. 

I chose the Kung Pao Spaghetti ($13) which are noodles cooked al dente, stir fry in hoisin sauce, then sautéed with chicken, dried chile, red and green bell peppers, and garnish with peanuts and scallions. I like my meal, it's delicious and fulfilling! The noodles are not dry and it's not oily. It's just the right amount of sauce and it has good flavor. I also got the Matcha Green Tea Latte ($6) with Almond Milk ($0.50). I like it when Matcha is served hot and it's not sweet. It's nice to complement any meal with Hot Matcha, because it really does add soothing and nutritional benefits.

The second order is not yet on the menu, but it will be soon. It's the General Tso Fried Rice ($13) which is stir fry rice mix with eggs, diced carrots, green peas, bacon strips, and General Tso sauce, then topped with a sunny side up egg and scallions. If you love bacon, then you'll definitely enjoy this order. The General Tso Fried Rice is substantially packed with bacon flavor. Overall, the meal is satisfying, service is prompt, and we're lucky we made it just in time for the movie."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price not so much. Gravy was amazing. 4 dumplings for $10 not worth it. Downfall they have no takeout. Service was also slow, not the best."}
{"text":"I am only going to write about two things here, the champagne mimosas served at the restaurant and the to die for bakery attached to this place. From the way they present their treats by putting those delicious Cruffins and tasty cupcakes and other unbelievably evil desserts into the manila colored boxes to the good service at this place, I so wish they had a location in  AZ. The cruffins were heavenly and during my stay here, I snuck down and got one every day as my Vegas sweet treat. Now as far as the mimosas go, you could go crazy downing them in Vegas, these are sweet with just a hint of tart and the juice so fresh. If only you could order a pitcher of these to go...yup they're that good."}
{"text":"The Turkey and Dressing dinner was just like mom makes it, oh so good. She had the Panini Burger which was savory and full of flavors. Charlie our waitress was the best of all!!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant Ive been to in a long time.....walked in around 3pm, only 2 other tables in here taken was slow, didn't think it would take 40 mins for our food to come...not to mention a burnt Ruben sandwich that I had to send back....very slow service too...never coming to this place again....MUST stay away unless you want slow service and bad food , very small portions too ... Also the light's had been flickering on and off the whole meal decided to go to the food court and grab pizza definitely better than a crappy burnt Ruben sandwich and a small portion of salad with no lettuce."}
{"text":"So me and my brother came to this restaurant after a movie at the palms tonight. The chef came out in person abd met us... because I eat vegan and he wanted to make sure that my meal was going to be OK. He handmade a bean pasta with corn and sweet baby tomatoes and toasted me bread with Olive oil and salt. It was absolutely amazing!!!! I would share pictures but I ate it too quickly to share. Try the appetizer of the cauliflower as well. Completely scrumptious! I strongly recommend eating here. Ask for Demarius, she was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Station Casinos recently acquired the Pams and immediately started the upgrades, smartly starting with the dining options. I've only been in once but that was enough to be able to tell that Lucky Penny is a significant upgrade from the previous 24 hour cafe. 

Location is a bit hard to find with limited signage around the property- from the sports book entrance, it's all the way in the back to the right, around an awkward corner. Hopefully the lack of signage will be addressed because there was hardly anyone here when I came by, likely due to simply not knowing it was there.

In any case, the menu has a lot to choose from without being overwhelming. I sat at the bar and chose the waffle grilled cheese, served with tomato bisque. Order was out in a reasonable amount of time and the dish was delicious. I wanted to add on a salad but the server who helped me said the portion was large and very filling- she was right. The sandwich was large and the cheese was gooey, the soup served warm for dipping with just the right balance of sweetness. I would get this again, but I'll probably come back for the Benedict and the Cinnamon Roll pancakes.

TIP FOR SOLO DINERS: Sit at the bar. There's a TV and USB chargers for your device, as well as individual lamps if you're a food photo person."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been at the Palms for four days. We had eaten here several times during our stay. Our last meal before our flight was by far the best. The food was consistent the entire stay, very good, but our server Sabrina was a rock star. She made our visit very special and took great care of us."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. I'm not a big fan of tomato soup or salmon, but both here we're everything.
I tried a few drinks here as well & we raved about this place for days, & ate here twice while in Vegas. 

My only complaints are how bright it is inside the restaurant, & even when it's dead, your server isn't attentive & will disappear in the back. 

Just make sure you order everything the first time the server comes to the table, because you may not see them again for an hour....not kidding."}
{"text":"Great place for a good meal in Vegas! I had the cheeseburger and it was delicious! Only cost $10. Charlie gave us great service!!"}
{"text":"Specifically asked to please not to put bacon in a takeout order of turkey sandwich, and sure the bacon is inside when you open the box after you get home......."}
{"text":"Had a snack at the Lucky Penny.  My friend had the Steak Frites rare and I had the Zin-Braised Meatballs.  The steak came back well done and the meatballs were inedible.  Most of the food was left as we opted for Sonic.

Hawaii guy in Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was just an average, but the concerning point was.. servers didn't know what channels they had.. 

My friend wanted to see CBS for the UF basketball game (usually CBS for SEC games) so we asked do you have or can you change the channel, she said yes. After we sat down, she came and said that I'm sorry I don't know how to switch the channels we have this different system that I have to ask other staff. Then other staff came, and said that my apology, we don't have CBS.
So, I felt that these people only care about sales.
This was on March 3rd around 9:15am.
Well, I talked to myself that I will never come back again.
So far, never been there.

{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The bacon fried rice is amazing! The service was top notch! So fun & nice. We had Charlie as our server and she is literally the BEST server I've ever had in my life!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"It was only a few days since they had open. It was a great place, nice decoration. Food was delicious very fresh made when to order. Loved the ratatatoui."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had in Las Vegas! Large menu with so many different choices!! We tried, the meat loaf, chicken & waffles, mimosas, burgers and more. We stay at the Palms hotel & there was no need to go outside of the hotel for food!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, the food lacked flavor and was served cold. The room is cool. I won't go back to eat at Lucky Penny."}
{"text":"Came here late one night after a concert and I am glad I did!  The place is gorgeous and just casual enough to be able to wear your streets or your club garb.  Along with the gorgeous atmosphere you had a gorgeous bartender and hostesses and then you get to the menu.  It was a lot bigger than I would have expected and yet almost everything looked amazing, even the simpler dishes.  

My buddy and I finally decided on three dishes (two for me lol).  I got the macho machaca hash which was very very good but could've been bigger, although I was quite hungry (a la the two meals).  It was both sweet and spicy but not overpowering on either.  It's the type of breakfast I would make at home if I were more talented.  I also ordered the cinnamon swirl pancakes with cream cheese icing.  These came out huge and very filling.  The problem was, they did not taste like they had that much cinnamon on them.  This next part is weird though.  It looked like it had a lot of icing on them but it was only on the top (of three) pancakes so it definitely needed more icing but then again, the icing was a bit too sweet or thick and could've used less but then they would've been dry, very odd.  My friend got the steak and eggs and that looked fantastic and to his delight, they were.  I don't think it was overpriced, especially for the amount we got.  I want to try other places at the palms but had such a good experience here that I may overlook them next time I'm here which unfortunately isn't all too often."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here for Valentine's Day for dinner and eating here for the second time is always better. I love the service and the ambiance of the white walls and lights. For a local this is the place to be if you don't prefer a crowded place. The server brought our food not too late and not too early either. I ordered the dirty burger and it was very good. Prices here are not that bad at all. I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"The remodel is nice, very bright open air.  I had the Cobb salad with white French dressing which I didn't realize was almost straight mayonnaise. It was awful.  I returned the salad and my server Karen was very nice and replaced the salad with a different dressing.  Iceberg lettuce.  For $13 I would have expected a more sophisticated salad.  My guests had cheeseburgers that were pretty good. $60 for lunch for 4."}
{"text":"I really want this place to be great. The decor is modern and fun, the servers and hosts are courteous and helpful, and the creativity on the menu is exciting...but, so far, the actual flavor and value aren't quite caught up yet. My first visit was late night and I got the Mongolian beef. The meat quality is great, full sized chunks of high grade beef and the veggies were fresh but something was wrong with the preparation because it was so bland. It had no juice or sauce. No spice at all. I have never added salt or pepper to Asian food but I did to this. The second time was with a friend and she got the fried Oreos. I got the loaded potato soup. The Oreos were good and came with a soft serve iced cream to dip the Oreos in. But, the soup was merely a thin layer with a pile of French fries and battered fried onions for volume. I could've done without so many fries and onions and would've liked more soup. It tasted good though but our two items plus tip came to 30 bucks. Bad value. I might need to explore the menu a little more before I give a thorough review"}
{"text":"They have some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my life!!! I cannot remember what everybody else ate, I remember everyone loved what they ordered.
Best part of this restaurant is the staff, especially Gloria (server extraordinaire) and Tommy (the manager). Gloria was amazingly attentive, helpful, and was a highlight to our trip. 
Both Gloria and Tommy have such great personalities. I hope management recognizes what gems they have in Gloria and Tommy, and PAYS THEM ACCORDINGLY!!! Good folks are hard to find. I would come back to the Lucky Penny just to see them both, and of course, the pancakes."}
{"text":"We moved here in October 2017 and found this place in Palms.  We have been there 5 times now and it was different every time! I highly recommend they can have the same service standard. 
I went there for lunch with my friends this Tuesday, the Manager was a tall guy named Sterling, he was staring at my chest area the entire time when he stopped by, I felt super uncomfortable and left."}
{"text":"Chai French toast and the Greek omelet for the win!! So good! Now if only I could get those recipes"}
{"text":"Quick spot to swing by on the way to some where. Came here to meet with a couple friends before heading back to California.

The fried Oreos were strongly recommended by our awesome server at the bar, and they did not disappoint! It was my first time having fried Oreos! Paired with ice cream, there was a nice balance of savory from the fried batter, and the sweetness of the Oreo that melted like butter in my mouth with a bit of ice cream on top.

The monkey bread too was delicious. I love how the monkey bread itself wasn't too sweet, and added more of (what tasted like) melted dark chocolate on top that was served on the side, it fulfilled the chocolate craving without making the dessert too sweet.

There are more items I would like to try here, especially, the alcoholic shakes. Bookmarking and keeping this place in mind on my next visit."}
{"text":"Find someplace else...
Ordered a hot chocolate and received a room temperature mug of milk... 
Also ordered the chocolate covered bacon - way too thick ,the chocolate was of poor quality and very thin slices of bacon that seemed very old. 
Service is not their strong suit- neither of the waitresses we interacted with had any personality or grasp of their job description."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, thus far it's been the best food I've had in Vegas. I had the rigatoni and it was great. Tasty meatballs and the ricotta was the highlight of the dish. But as good as the food was the waitress SABRINA made the meal. We had a party of 7 and her professionalism for serving was bar none. She is nice, she is informative, beautiful smile and has a refreshing personality. I would come back in a minute. Sabrina needs a raise!"}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant in the Palms. A friend and I had breakfast there. The ambiance is a '60s vibe with matching decor. We had the omelette and corned-beef hash. I'd have to say it was the best omelet I've ever had at a restaurant. It was so fluffy and all the ingredients were fresh; so fresh that the jalapeños had my mouth on fire! So good. The potato cakes that came with the omelet were seasoned to perfection (no need to add condiments) and the hash was made from scratch too (not that out of can stuff). The meat was succulent and it came with perfectly over easy eggs. Customer service is top notch as well. We definitely will be going back to try more things on the menu. It's a great place for both large and small groups with hearty appetites at any time of the day. Highly recommend giving"}
{"text":"Everything is good here!!  The breakfast, the lunch, the dinner, the desserts...you can't go wrong!! And they serve the full menu 24hrs."}
{"text":"We were staying at Palm's Place and hungry for a midnight snack so we took the skytube from 2nd floor over to Palm's Casino where Lucky Penny is located. We were told that Lucky Penny is a diner that operates 24/7 so I had pretty low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high end twist that they have on diner style food options. 

I absolutely loved their stunning decor and brightly lit artistic ambiance. We sat at a cute curved booth so it was perfect for holding hands underneath the table :) and also for sharing food. Our waitress Charlie was very friendly and attentive. She was knowledgeable of the menu, super helpful and overall just absolutely amazingggggg. 

2 Vodka & Monster ($??) - We actually wanted Vodka and Redbull, but they did not have any redbull so we settled fro vodka and monster. It was not as tasty but it was the nice energizing boost we needed at midnight. 

Loaded Potato Soup ($7) - This is not your typical loaded potato soup. It has a potato soup base with a hefty amount of crispy crinkle cut fries topped with sour cream, crispy bacon, cheddar, pablano chiles and crispy fried onions. It was absolutely delicious and the portion was generous. It was also fun to eat as we dipped our fries into the creamy soup base. We agreed that this was the winning dish of the night!! ;) 

Classic In-House Corned Beef Hash ($12) - A crisp corned beef, potatoes, tomato sauce and poached egg. All I ate from this was the 2 poached eggs. For the record, the eggs were overcooked and the inside was not as soft as I would like from a poached egg. The hash had to much fat content I found myself picking out all of the meat and picking at the potatoes slightly. 

Chicken Fingers ($10) - Buttermilk marinated crispy chicken with ranch dipping sauce. This came out a bit late because the kitchen had a hiccup and our lovely waitress was professional enough to send it back and fix it for us. The presentation was very cute but I wasn't a fan of the chicken fingers. It was a bit too flavorless and tough. I have just had way way better chicken fingers and this doesn't even hit average. 

Whether you are craving breakfast, lunch or dinner, Lucky Penny is a solid spot for you to grab a bite. It is especially convenient for guests who are staying at Palm's Casino or Palm's Place and I really appreciate that they are open 24/7. This is probably one of the nicer places to grab a bite after midnight."}
{"text":"It is pretty expensive for breakfast here but it is delicious. Very friendly staff that was very accommodating. The Lucky Penny was the highlight of staying at the Palms resort for us."}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the Palms.   We came just  for a quick cocktail on the bar and got to meet a super cool and classic bartender from Jerusalem that made us stay and enjoy a whole nught.   We took the cocktails he recommended us and we loved them.  
Thanks Noam and thank Lucky Penny for a great night."}
{"text":"Every stay at the Palms resort casino; the Lucky Penny is a must go to! Especially if your craving a late night snack. Make sure and ask for Gloria as your server. She makes the whole dining experience a fabulous time. 
My favorite thing to order is the breakfast club sandwich...amazing! And if you are wanting a yummy dessert try the Fat Elvis. You will be craving it until your next visit! 
Actually you can't really go wrong with anything on their extensive menu. 
I am already looking forward to my next visit to Las Vegas so we can dine at the Lucky Penny while we stay at the Palms."}
{"text":"Ate here our first night staying at Palms Place which was during game 7 of the world series.   First off the service was amazing. Our hostess was so sweet and kind and our waitress Maria was very friendly and attentive. I never needed to ask her to refill my water and I drank a lot of water. The food was also very good. I had the waffle grilled cheese and tomato soup. Omg I wanted so much more of both. The grilled cheese was perfectly toasty, had a good crunch to it and tastey. The tomato soup was probably the best I've ever had. Husband had The almost boneless fried chicken and he said it was very good, just a bit pricy. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, is very clean and bright."}
{"text":"We stayed Memorial Day Weekend at the Palms and ate here 5 times.  Each time the food was absolutely delicious.  The Penny Benedict is by far the best eggs Benedict I have ever had.  I could eat that all day.  My boyfriend and my sister really enjoyed the Breakfast Pizza, the Avocado Tostadas, the Banana Parfait and the muffins.  The Lobster Roll is fantastic.   Service was excellent, friendly and attentive, although they are a little slow on bringing you the bill and picking it up.  I would stay at the Palms again just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best 24 hour cafe's I've been to. In 2 days I've eaten here 3 times. Once alone, and twice with friends, great food and service each time.  Server Maria helped me decide on what to get on 2 of those visits, and she was spot on with all her suggestions. From the \"Panucho\" appetizer (a delicious sope type dish) to dessert (I had a red velvet lava brownie sundae) I was surprised how good the food was. I loved the just spicy enough Kung Pao Spaghetti, while my friends had a traditional turkey dinner, and a veggie burger. This place exceeded my expectations. I'll probably be back in the morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food at Lucky Penny was nothing short of amazing! However, this would have been a much higher review if the service would have been even average. My sister and I ordered a bottle of champagne and orange juice and it took over 30 minutes just to get those drinks. It took us another 25 minutes after we got our drinks to put in our order and about another 45 minutes for our order to be delivered.

I ordered the waffle grilled cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup and my sister got the breakfast pizza. I have no complaints about any of the food and the grilled cheese waffle sandwich was one of the best things I've had in Vegas! It's a shame that the service is so bad because the restaurant itself is so cute and the food was amazing. 

First I thought it might just be our waiter that was lacking in customer service but, when I took a look around almost every table around us was making negative comments about the service and how long everything was taking to come out. My advice would be to clean up the customer service because in a city like Las Vegas there are many places to dine. If the customer service would have been on par and the food would have come out within a reasonable time I would have made this review a four to five star rating."}
{"text":"I had the panini burger and my boyfriend had the turkey and dressing,both dishes were delicious! Our server Charlie was amazing! She was very knowledgeable and explained to us in detail the different dishes we had questions about. The decor was great! They are open 24 hours and serve the full menu at all hours."}
{"text":"Have now been here twice in recent months, and both times I have been thoroughly disappointed.  

The first time, the service was very slow, and the portion size of my meal was not adequate. 

The second time, which was today, I had the Denver Cheddar Omelet.  It had ham, onions, and peppers in addition to the cheese.  There wasn't nearly enough cheese, and shockingly the ham, onions, and peppers in the omelet could most likely barely fill a thimble.  The first three bites I took felt more like I was eating scrambled eggs, because I can barely tell anything else was mixed in.  

The potatoes on the side were mushy potato cakes, and get a flat out F-.

I do like that this restaurant has a selection of iced coffee/lattes, and gave it another star just for that.  

Sad to see that the former location of one of the best coffee shops in Vegas was revamped to something that isn't even approaching half as good."}
{"text":"Friendly svc & attractive pastries... Go for it!  We deserve a treat once in a while!  Gotta get the $26 beautiful cake on a special occasion like soon...Will have to invent something like Special Cake Princess Day or Cant Resist Getting This So Why Try.... But yeah, the key lime pie pastry was absolutely scrumptious"}
{"text":"Don't do it!

I'm local and live close by so tried this place half dozen times  before and after the name change. Used to be called the ' 24 Hour Cafe' but nothing has been changed besides the bright flickering lights. 

It is still one of the worst restaurants ever. The soup is the same and just terrible. Portions are small and expensive. The service is so bad on average, takes a long time to get food ordered. If you have any requests for substitutions you'll have a hard time. 

While you're waiting to just get a drink you watch several employees taking. I've even waited several minutes just to be seated watching employees talk. 

Stations did good job fixing the buffet for the better but this restaurant needs so much work. You can't keep the same terrible employees and terrible menu and trick locals. Can't believe they can change names and remove all the reviews they had before. Because they literally scam people and steal money doing this I thought I'd post my first review. 

I can almost guarantee that this review will go ignored because I've spoke with several managers in past years, each was only their temporary to fix the place, and even though were nice they couldn't do anything but say sorry. You need a permanent manager that will fire half the uncaring staff and create an actually new menu not just raise the prices and add a few weird new items. 

I'll update if I ever get a chance. 

Take care"}
{"text":"Super happy to have stumbled upon the Lucky Penny. It's a great new all day spot with delicious staples. I didn't even realize it was new until someone told me after I finished my meal-- the service was so friendly and knowledgable! Great options for whatever you're in the mood for.
 
But, what I was most excited about was the coffee! The first time I met friends at the Lucky Penny I ordered a nitro cold brew that was soooo flavorful and the PERFECT strength (none of that diluted bitter stuff that you come across so often). It was exactly what I needed to give me that extra push to get through my day. The second time I dined at Lucky Penny, I got a matcha latte and I'm still dreaming about. It's SO hard to get a good matcha in Vegas and this place seriously delivers (not to mention it was beautifully presented). I really love and look for a restaurant where I can come back multiple times and have different experiences, and knowing that I can grab my morning latte to-go and then come back later for a bite and a perfect espresso makes this a go to for me whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! First if you sit at the bar and need to charge your phone? No problem! Plug it up at the lamps! We ate here twice while staying at the palms.

First time it was late. I was craving something hearty. I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My guy ordered the steak and frites. The meatloaf was thick, juicy and definitely hearty. The gravy and crispy fried onions were so good. The mashed potatoes were perfectly smooth and the broccoli I really didn't eat much of but were good. I really just wanted the meat loaf and mash. I tasted the garlic herb frites with tarragon aioli .....mouth watering delicious! Ha! 

Second time here was breakfast. We ordered food to share which was perfect because I like to eat everything. We ordered the breakfast pizza which was yummy. Only thing was I wished the egg was cooked a little more. I enjoyed getting sausage with every bite. French toast with added bananas and strawberries was thick and soft. Very easy to cut with a fork and the perfect sweet to eat for breakfast. Lastly the macho machaca hash....braised beef short rib, sunny side up egg,potatoes, onions, chipotle crema and pick de gallo! OMG this was probably my favorite thing. The braised beef was soooooo tender and delicious! Needless to say this dish did not last long. I had mimosas to drink which was not like your average. Best mimosa I've ever had. I not only tasted orange juice but mango as well which was a nice surprise. Definitely a hit with this place!"}
{"text":"I dig this place as it is 24/7 and has cronuts.  The menu has anything you could possible want and the plates are quite large, perfect for drunken leftovers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and speedy service.  The kids loved the pizza, I loved the burger panini, and my wife loved the waffles.  Our visit was tainted a bit by two nearby parties who were very rude and/or vulgar.  Otherwise, this restaurant may have earned five stars!"}
{"text":"One of the best places near the Strip!!! The food is always fantastic and the service is wonderful. Classy inside you don't have to dress up though!! Open 24 hours, which is great!! I have been here several times and it is so nice to be able to find a classy place late at night!! Very easy to get to within the Palms!! The bar also has individual outlets and USB charging ports for use of computers, a very cool and nice feature for working on a laptop while enjoying a good wine.  I always take friends or meet them here.  The menu is a wide variety and a lot of healthy type choices.  Also fresh ingredients appear to be used in many of their menu options."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars... the food is fantastic!!! But the service SUCKS. 

We stayed at the Palms last month for 4 days & ate here 3 times over the course of our visit. The first time, we just grabbed cupcakes and milk at the counter. The service was lousy and the cupcakes were way too small for the $5 pricetag... but they were delicious!

The next time we ate here, I was reluctant, but it was 1 AM and our options were slim. We sat at the restaurant and ordered both breakfast and dinner items amongst our group of 5. Again, the service was crap. Our server copped some 'tude and the food took FOREVER but, WOW! Everything was excellent! I had the breakfast sandwich... one of my go-to's, and it was without a doubt, the best I've ever had. There was not one item anyone in our party was displeased with, and both the breakfast and dinner meals had the same level of freshness. Super generous portion sizes can also easily be shared! 

The third time we ate here, we ordered it via room service. Big thumbs up to the Palms for having the best room service I've ever had! Again, we ordered a combo of breakfast and dinner items... spaghetti, waffles, grilled cheese with soup, and that fabulous breakfast sandwich. Everything was perfect. 

Bad service or not, I'd eat here again in a heartbeat! But I'd definitely like to see some friendlier faces in their restaurant and counter."}
{"text":"Nice spot, they got really good food, they serve good drinks, and their customer service is stellar."}
{"text":"Sabrina was our waitress and she was awesome. She recommended some amazing meals for our group. We had walnut shrimp, wonderful giant gyoza - best we've ever eaten and she even put up with our drunken selves demanding shots and cocktails with gracious service! Go here if you want a real meal to help absorb your cocktails in Vegas. Great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Nice Cafe. Light and updated.  Veggie burger and cheese  burger scrumptious. Super service. Took pictures but can't get them on review."}
{"text":"Delicious potato soup! I highly recommend it! So good it's like comfort food...!! Also, the steak and fries is to die for! 

For dessert I had the key lime pie (see pictures) and it was yummy and my friend had the berry cobbler which she said was relish!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place one star but the decor and music was pleasant. They pride themselves on being open after hours however the service is...... well there is none. The bar tender was trying to take care of more than she could and other staff where just kinda standing around. We got a key lime pie that was pretty much yogurt and paid $9. That alone took 30 min."}
{"text":"I really liked the variations of food selection here. I got the grill cheese waffle and it tasted good. The staff was friendly and the environment was nice. The food did take awhile to get here that was the only disappointment."}
{"text":"9:30am, just finished the drive from LA, decided to head to the Palms for the ditch Fridays pool party, but FOOD first! Service a bit disorganized at first and slightly slow, but once our orders were in, the food came out quick! My best friend had the American Breakfast, and I had the Macho Machaca Hash. My dish was surprisingly not too heavy, extremely flavorful, and all around amazing. I literally scraped my plate. Oh and the price was just right."}
{"text":"This one star rating is for the service only. Or lack thereof.  
   My wife and I have been in here before, for breakfast, and although there were very few people, it took FOREVER to be waited on.  So we thought well, they had just opened a week or so earlier, we'll overlook it.
   We went back to try it just a few days ago,were shown a table by the hostess, and we were ignored for about 5 minutes. It was very slow there, not many people at all, looked for our waitress and noticed she was talking with another waitress.  As we watched, you could tell they weren't talking about anything serious, just gabbing. She didn't bother asking us if we wanted water, coffee, if we were ready to order, nothing.
  I told my wife let's go to Earl of Sandwich. So we stood up and headed for the exit, she finally glances over and comes over. And she actually acted surprised we were leaving.  Totally clueless.
   When we did eat here the first time, the food was pretty good, but not worth such horrible service.  The waitstaff need to learn how to wait on people."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  All of our dishes sat under the heat lamps too long.  Everything came out dried up.  My aunt had the pasta and had to get extra sauce because the pasta was dry and crunchy.  It tasted ok, will probably get better once the service improves.  Hate saying this because people try, but the service is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Overall bad service. It wasn't busy but our  waitress kept forgetting what we asked for not just once. Once our food was brought to the table, no one came to check if we needed anything else or how our food tasted.  Multiple tables were dirty for at least about an hour before being cleaned.  As for the food, it wasn't even worth it for the price.  I know I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It was fight night a few weeks ago we made a stop here because everywhere else it was packed. Best Panucho EVER. It was honestly the best dinner i ever had in vegas. The customer service was great. Dont recall who my waiter was but he was amazing. Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is on a whole the nastiest group of people I have run into at a restaurant . I own a residence at this hotel and we get 10 percent off our bill , but the waitress was snapping at me that I better give her my owners card or I can just forget it .  She said my license wasn't enough ( my address matches the restaurant ) and a quick call would confirm . Gloria is the name of the waitress and she slammed the bill on my table when I asked kindly to speak to a manager :   She was so rude that I don't ever want to go back there and I have gone there once a week for several months . They know me there but to give me a hard time they refused to honor the discount .  It is not the money .. it is the principle and this was a horrible experience here . The manager on duty wasn't too helpful either . I did not recognize her so perhaps she is new .   I'm so disappointed and pay a lot of money at this hotel and gamble a lot but they treated me and my son like garbage .  I rate this an F for the incompetence of the staff ."}
{"text":"Changed for the better. SABRINA is awesome! Waffle grill cheese is super good. Buffalo wings are not so great."}
{"text":"It was terrible because I went to my family and hostess girl set us down for the table?until that it was fine but after that 10 min pass, nobody show up to our table.
My kids keep saying hungry.
So we we waiting again more10 min.
Ok now I'm done I started mad because nobody showing us say nothing, seriously??? 
We have kids, and I saw the Vasser was just standing on wall and don't move nothing.

I can understand little bit about this,like ok maybe server is busy.   Like that. But nothing say to us after 20 min??
Usually if they make customer wait,they will say some word and customer-will wait.

So I just left this restaurant because this is not right.
And when we leave after here I told host that I'm gonna leave because nobody show up to us and ask drink neither.

Can you guess what she said??

Ok

To me excuse me!?

I just decided not gonna going back this place anymore and I will complain to the manager now"}
{"text":"After spending a night at the Palms, I tried Lucky Penny for breakfast.  The renovated buffet was not yet open so this was the only option unless I wanted some fast food from the food court.

I took the option to sit at the bar.  I ordered coffee--the rooms in the Ivory Tower do not have coffee makers--and I was ready for my caffeine fix.  I also ordered a bottle of house made juice called the Flame Out! with fresh turmeric, carrot, ginger, orange, lemon, and celery.  The juice was very refreshing and with flavors one doesn't experience often.

After a refill of coffee, the Penny Bennies arrived on a very hot plate.  The dish didn't look that great, but it tasted quite good.  This Benedict had poached eggs, ham, garlic toast, and hollandaise.  The garlic toast was pressed thin and there were thin slices of ham on the toast and then topped with the poached eggs.  The Hollandaise was just OK.  The breakfast also comes with two rounds of \"crushed potatoes.\"  These are home fries that have been crushed into the round circles.

Service at the bar was quick and friendly.  I have to try Lucky Penny for an evening meal sometime."}
{"text":"I'd been to this space a few years back (pre-renovation) when this was your typical 24 hour casino level diner. Nothing special, not terrible. It was also where my friend once ordered an eggs benedict sans hollandaise (thanks to Anthony Bourdain), so this place will always live in my heart for the savagery and incredulity that was bestowed upon this friend at 5am by waitstaff and other pals alike. Anyway, this time was just a quick hit takeout. Had a veggie burger, which was fine, serviceable, but the fries were better. The highlight was the waitstaff giving me a bottle opener to take to my room to pop the bubbly (Pellegrino), as neither of us could be completely certain the room was stocked with one. A+, my friend."}
{"text":"Came for brunch with family on Sunday morning.  We were delighted by the well curated menu that has a great mix of staples and some fusion fun.  Machaca Hash was a huge hit combining the soft yolk of the poached eggs, tender short rib, tortillas and hash.  A dish I won't forget for a while!  So much attention to the little things made the experience pleasing - from the piping hot lattes to the real maple syrup to the friendly staff.
This place is a nice oasis needed coming off the busy hustle of Vegas nightlife."}
{"text":"So living in Vegas, and being a waiter previously, I have high expectations for service. This town is known for its service industry and I felt obligated to share a poor representation. I've eaten at the Lucky Penny at the Palms multiple times and never experienced such a dissatisfactory service. It started off with waiting 25 min just take our order. Then I watched my cocktail at the bar sitting for an additional 10 min before it was served.  I then had to get up and ask the manager to send our server over for a refill. One of my guests sat for 18 min with no drink. Even after the manager spoke with Francisco , our waiter, it still took 48 min for our food to hit the table. Then when I reviewed my order, I noticed it was missing one of the main ingredients listed on the menu. Pizza Margherita without tomatoes. After discussing with Francisco, he then proceeded to tell me that the chef said that it's not included. I presented the menu to prove this was part of the description and he then said \"oh yeah, your right.\"  He then said they can add them after the fact and I refused. My guests were already finished eating by the time this offer to rectify was presented to me. After chatting with my 5 guests I also found out that 2 other orders were incorrect.  Finally I got the bill and nothing was done to compensate for poor service besides removing the pizza I sent back. So against my better judgment I still threw a 20% tip and paid the bill. I the proceeded to share the experience the the manager Sterling. After hearing the experience, he said I'm sorry and that was basically it. Nothing was done to try rectify the evenings dissatisfied experience. I wasn't looking for a free meal by any means, however the fact that I still paid for my watered down Moscow Mule was insulting enough. This will definitely be my last visit and I will not be sending my clients here again."}
{"text":"This cafe, nestled inside the Palms hotel and Casino, is open 24hrs and has something for everyone. I actually ate with my two teen daughters at 1am on a Saturday morning.

It's bright and modern. All good is made fresh, the wait staff is cherry (even at 1am), and the selection was amazing! 

They serve breakfast all day and my daughter highly recommends the coffee flavored French toast. I had a burger that was filling and tasted so good.

They also have a vast selection of decadent desserts that temp the most ardent of non-dessert grabbers.

They serve Abundant Italian dishes as well as American comfort food favorites.

We really liked this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today.  Overpriced!

We were locals and regulars at the cafe that was at this location in the Palms.  We think the waitress Karen is one of the best.  We followed to the steak house location while they gutted and remodeled the cafe.   Today was our first time back to the location of the cafe now called the Lucky Penny.  

Would have rated it a 1 except for the great attentive waitress service of Karen.  

Big time disappointed in breakfast.  Prices went up.  Value for your dollar is now low.  Went for Steak and Eggs.  $19.  Two of us ordered it.  Can't tell you if it is worth it or not.   Karen had to come back and tell us it was not available today. 

Went with a Ham and Cheese Omelet.  $13   Very similar to breakfast places serving it for under $10.  Coffee now $3.  Omelet came with one slice of toast not two.  My butter that I spread on it never melted.  

Not one to complain and make a scene.  Not ever looking for a free meal by complaining in front of everyone.  More of a silent complainer....I just don't return.  I ate the omelet.  Didn't complain, but it doesn't mean I enjoyed the experience.

The trend seems to be remodeling and upping the prices at several of the off strip casinos many locals visit.  Guess they don't want us?   At least there is still free parking at the Palms. 

Hate to tell them but we still get killer steak and eggs for $9.99 and $2.50 coffee elsewhere.  Can't see paying a $25+ breakfast bill when you start including a tip."}
{"text":"Quaint 24/7 diner.  Staff is friendly and the place has an old time feel.  After a night of binge drinking it seems like you traveled back in time.  Kind of like the movie pleasantville but without the bad acting and story line.

Huge variety of food and they seem to do everything well.

4.5/5 stars.  My brother says try the buffalo wings."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give this place 4 stars, but then I realized there was really nothing to complain about at all, so 5 stars it is!

When I went to the Palms earlier in May, this place wasn't even here, so I asked the waitress when they opened.  She said the day we went was their first day!  She said they've been doing training the past few days.  

Anyway, onto the food.  I came here for dinner, but they serve breakfast/lunch/dinner options all day.  I felt in the mood for some breakfast, so I ordered the machaca and it was great.  It wasn't like other machacas I've had, but all the ingredients were on point, and by the time it occurred to me to take a picture, it was already in my belly.  Oh well.

A table near us apparently ordered the fish & chips and dear god, the fish was big.  It may have been Moby Dick himself.

So yea, looks like this place is off to a good start.  The waitstaff were extremely friendly (though I suppose since it's their first day, they better be!) and our orders came out pretty quickly.  I would definitely come back here again when I'm back at the Palms later this year."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! This was previously known as 24/7 cafe but it's been remodeled. We got the biscuits and gravy (yummy), egg and bacon fried rice (that's a must!!!) and a waffle. Best meal we had all week!"}
{"text":"Came in late after midnight and looked for some late night dinner to cap the night off. I believe Lucky Penny is open 24 hrs. My plate didn't have thd biggest portions but it was FULL OF FLAVOR I had the Chinese spaghetti plate. Prices are not the best deal in town and for a place called lucky penny maybe there should be a segment that offers  the no brainers value meals or something. Most of the menu is an ok price, nothing outrageous high price. 
The best thing is the ambiance and service. My bartender was the nicest young man with great suggestions and descriptions for each plate. On top of that great conversation about hotel renovations about life in general. He made my dinner like having dinner with a friend. 
The place is clean well lit and the food came right out and my drink was kept full. Palms is undergoing renovations as it was just acquired by station casinos. This would be one  the high end resorts in tje group, so I'm looking forward  to the finished concept. And for lucky penny I'd be back no problem."}
{"text":"This is not your normal cafe!! The food is outstanding and service is amazing !! One of a kind highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had visited the cafe at the Palms.  It has been completed renovated and is now Lucky Penny.  Service was good...  Prices are a bit high for an off-strip property.  I am interested to come back and try the pancakes.  We ordered the Greek Omelet (came with best toast ever...  yes, I know - I am raving about toast, however, it was DELICIOUS), the Penny Benny, and the fruit platter."}
{"text":"New decor is great, thoughtful. The food, breakfast, was mediocre.  Service was horrible."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. The seats were nice and soft and the colors inside were bright and happy. I love how it was designed. Our server was friendly and helped get our order quick. I highly recommend the gyoza here. It was delicious and sauce was good. It was perfectly cooked. We ordered the chicken fried steak and the chicken dinner entree with arugula salad. The portion was very big so I do recommend that you share or take leftovers home. My chicken dish came out and it was ok. It was just Argula salad on cooked chicken. The chicken was too big and I wish it came with more sides or something because it was just a big piece of chicken. The seasoning on it could be better. I would love to come to restaurant again. It's a nice vibe and food was good."}
{"text":"Cute well lit. The waitress was very nice and attentive. Came in for a late night meal after the club. The good was really good. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My friends wasn't impressed only because the service was a little slow. I got the corn beef hash with poached eggs and it was very good. My wife really enjoyed her meal. The atmosphere was pretty cute."}
{"text":"Let me tell ya bout my best friend. After waking up at 315 am for a flight to Vegas, by the time we got to The Palms we were hungry. I ordered this fabulous bagel platter and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. When our server Andy asked me if I wanted a plain bagel or a EVERYTHING bagel, my heart skipped a beat. It literally stepped up the platter x10!!! It had fresh smoked salmon, tomatoes, onions, capers and cream cheese. They didn't skimp on the salmon or the cream cheese. It was the perfect way to start off our trip. Andy you were so polite and a great server!"}
{"text":"Visited the Lucky Penny at Palms Resort this weekend, very clean beautiful room with relaxing atmosphere, they greeted me as soon as I walked up, and sat me right away, it was like a well oiled machine, drink order, apps, then entree. Very friendly staff and nice size food portions. I highly recommend to all I speak with about the amazing experience I had, Great job Palms/Lucky Penny!"}
{"text":"Useful Tip: Order The Waffle Grilled Cheese (you'll thank me later)

My favorite unfiltered dame and I grabbed some brunch at this super modern vibes 24/7 cafe (located in the back corner of Palms). The decor gives off hip socal vibes.

Service was a bit slow but the food was absolutely amazing!

Waffle-Grilled Cheese $13 the combination of cheeses were delightful and the tomato soup was amazing as well. 

Caesar Salad $9+Shrimp $7 a-little more dressing than I'd prefer but it was definitely a great balance with the savory sweet food ordered. Great portion size.

Chai Latte French Toast $11 The spiced caramel syrup was sweet just how I like it accompanied by huge slices of French Toast. 

Three highly recommended dishes worth returning for!

$46+Tip"}
{"text":"This place disappointed me first time when I ordered my dish and I asked waitress if it's spicy she said no. Then my wok with chicken came with spicy sauce and I had to give it back because I'm not allowed eat spicy food.  Then she was so slow to bring menu and take order that we just left. She took her time to talk to other people or her colleagues.
But I gave this place second chance and it was much much better. 
I loved my turkey meal and everything was so perfect. Even tho thanksgiving was over but they still have this meal on their menu and this is great. Turkey came so tender, sauce tasted like it was made by best American traditions and stuffing was savory and yummy. 
Their desserts are really tasty it was second time I took dessert there. I usually take them to go and enjoy with cup of tea. That time I was really sick and this little cake made me feel better."}
{"text":"Bomb Buffalo wings, chicken fried steak, waffle grilled cheese with tomato soup, and meatballs with polenta mashed potatoes!!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place for sure. It has such potential! Ambiance and decor is great. Check out the hostess desk front side. Really neat use of pennies! Food was solid. I had corned beef hash which was made in house. Nice chunks of corned beef were very moist. They have these cool potato cakes for their breakfast potato option which my husband liked. But overall the experience was a 3 Star one. Service was TERRIBLE! And it wasn't just us. Saw many angry faces waiting for service either drinks or food or just to be greeted by a server. One party left angry before they even could order a drink, while we were there. The drink I ordered at the very beginning came AFTER our food! We also had to ask for basic condiments like ketchup and jelly.  I don't blame this all on the server. Seems like staff isn't used efficiently. They could help each other way more. That's on the manager who was visible but not really involved even as the place got busier. 

I would however, be willing to give it an extra star for three things which I'll explain below:

BLOODY MARY - Kentucky Mary. Made with bourbon and with some smoke flavor. House made Bloody Mary mix was good consistency, smooth and flavorful. Never had one with bourbon and I liked it.  They have 4 other varieties with 4 different liquors which we were told were custom made to complement each liquor used by the awesome hostess.

HOSTESS- she had red hair and I didn't catch her name but wish I had. She should be manager. She helped us decide on drinks and gave great suggestions! Greeted us after the meal too. Made poor service more tolerable. 

CRUFFIN - cross between a croissant and a muffin that resembles a cinnamon roll. Delicious! Took ours for the road. 

I would try again if I was in the area. Hopefully after construction at the Palms is finished it will improve."}
{"text":"We skipped breakfast and went straight to the lunch menu at the Lucky Penny. We were immediately seated by a cute petite Latina female and greeted by our foreign server. He was super hot  and talkative. He took our order and pointed out all the best selections on the menu. We waited about 20 minutes for our food. He had the steak frites and I had the walnut shrimp with broccoli. The steak was medium rare and the sauce on my walnut shrimp was delicious. Our server chatted with us several times throughout the morning. He asked us about Bourbon Street, due to us brining our own morning drinks to the table, and we recommend he go try it out. We decided to skip dessert and head to the casino. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to skip breakfast and get straight down and dirty with the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Had to come check out the new restaurant at the Palms.  Now that Stations casinos has taken over they are really trying to get the Palms back to what it used to be.  This is a great addition and has good food and good service.  We like the omelets and the breakfast burgers.  Good stuff.  Will definitely be back. Brittany was a great server too."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! Great menu ! must have the ratioulle frittata and bartender Lorelei makes an amazing hummingbird! See her!! Ordered the berry soufflé for dessert! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"A casual restaurant in the back end of the Palms casino.. Food ok, lots of calories glutton meals, portions are big, food taste just ok, nothing to write home about- pricey - no station casino meal deals, since they now own Palms.
Example pricey- lobster roll-$25
I have been here twice, the menu has a big selection of garbage food, not practical, maybe to impress the non locals visiting.. I only go to use my food credit, and it does even cover most of the meals, once you have gone there , you might not return...
Parking is free and readily available,take out on their dessert ( no prices, must ask)? Service slight slower when busy, even though they have many servers, servers also get drinks,therefore that might be the delays to get back to you as they are getting drinks for the other tables they are serving?
Usually with a new place, mgmt would by and ask how we doing, just a quick hello, never saw any managers, both times I have visited. Would of expressed service slow, we waited a bit to get our check and boxes for our leftovers, FYI the boxes they use sucks, they leak and do not close well, granted they are paper products..."}
{"text":"Breakfast food and desserts are awesome here! I love baked pastries and Lucky Penny provides them all. My favorite was the pancakes. Better than you average IHOP's pancakes, these lit a dance floor on my taste buds!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Cross contamination and SAD service. I came here because i was staying at the palms and they offered breakfast 24/7. so seeing as they had no wait and very few people I decided this was the perfect place to grab a bite before my flight. i sat down at 730, waited 10 mins until someone finally saw me and came to take my order. I ordered the vegan gf PB&J pancakes with the acai berry syrup with a side of berries. I figured simple quick food. I tried getting the waiter for 20 mins to order my drink, no luck. I got my food FOURTY FIVE mins later. no service from my waiter, despite there being only a couple tables at the restaurant with people who had already gotten food...and I DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE THE RIGHT FOOD. They brought me bacon, and I said I'm sorry I didn't order this and I'm also vegan as i mentioned before. They then brought me lukewarm plain pancakes with 3 bananas and some jiff peanut butter on top. Just dry pancakes with incredibly artificial tasting peanut butter. I felt so neglected, my waiter just rolled her eyes consistently. I tried getting the waiter for another 15 mins and during this time I had tried asking different staff to even bring me my order that was on the menu, not half of the items left off. Then I recieved a tiny cup of maple syrup (not at all real maple syrup, definitely aunt jemima) from a male staff who looked incredible run down but was atleast incredibly nice, I explained I would love the rest of my order, the acai syrup and berries because eating dry, cold pancakes with peanut butter is just deeply unpleasant. asked another time for syrup. was told just another minute we cant find the acai syrup (its part of the dish I ordered definitely not anywhere near a special request) finally they brought me an acai puree, not syrup. and i proceeded to try and eat the worst pancakes I've ever had in my life. they then finally bring me a teeny cup of berries filled with water (no idea why) and then i notice theres bits of salad inbetween my pancakes. Yes there are green strings in my pancakes. not even sure why because it wasnt from the berries. I was so done at this point I was now running late for my flight and asked them if they could rush my check. I get my check and it says bacon vegetables and pancakes. I then say i never ordered bacon or vegetables...that took another 15 minutes and I was finally allowed to leave the worst meal I've ever had. I cant recommend this place at all. I feel so sad having to leave this but it was unacceptable being there for 2 hours."}
{"text":"My server was super duper nice! I needed an outlet so I could work and eat bfast and he moved me to a booth near an outlet right away. 
I ordered a fresh fruit platter and bagel with cream cheese. Along with an ice black coffee.

The fresh fruit was a good amount and i really liked the berries mixed with the mint leaves. The banana had a bit of discoloration but it wasn't bad or anything. I was a bit surprised that the bagel was like toasted a little too close to being burnt. I like it like that so its fine but others might have not. The coffee was alright and when i wanted to take the rest back to the room my server was willing to pack fresh ice coffee for me! Super nice. 

The interior is pretty too"}
{"text":"When it was made known in mid-2016 that Station Casinos planned to purchase The Palms it was with a watchful eye that changes were gauged at a distance, suggestions that Alize would not be affected thus far holding true aside from Chris Bulen stepping down as Chef and rumors that the Buffet would be closed largely irrelevant, the biggest news since the takeover coming when newly promoted  Corporate Executive Chef Joseph Kudrak announced that Lucky Penny had been born from the previous 24 Seven Café Space.

Breaking with tradition for Station Casinos nomenclature, each of their prior properties including Red Rock labeling the all-day and all-night dining option as simply \"Grand Café\" with the majority of these locations executing better than necessary, Lucky Penny shows a lot of forward thinking in terms of both branding and décor, the formerly dark space now open widely to the gaming floor with plenty of televisions, gold chandeliers and marble plus several unique touches including neon affirmations and cute creatures made of discarded household items.

Not hiding its 'everything to everyone' aspirations, a necessity for any Restaurant intending to keep up with the likes of HeXx, Grand Lux or Mr. Lucky's, it was just past 6:00pm on a Friday that five diners sat down at a large table toward the back of the space where Chef Kudrak was currently helping cooks dial in a menu featuring no less than fifty items, everything from Pancakes to a Lobster Roll and Mongolian Beef offered alongside specialty Cocktails and Shakes, the meal divided into four courses and starting out with Breakfast that featured lemony Eggs Benedict served with crispy Potato squares plus Custard-soaked Chai Latte French Toast flanked in Whipped Cream and a big stack of fluffy Cinnaroll Pancakes dripping with Cream Cheese Frosting.

Part self-selecting the menu and part allowing the kitchen to fill in with some of their favorites it was after some debate as to just how much of the triple-stack to enjoy that servers reset the table for a round of appetizers, two big Shakes with a creamy base and carefully crafted balance soon joining soft-drinks and an unfortunately flat Nitro Coffee as the group received Mexican, Chinese and American favorites; the Pot stickers fairly dull in terms of their filling while both the Tortilla topped in spicy Chicken and the skewered Buffalo Wings fared far better, the former particularly noteworthy as it eats lighter than one would guess with the stuffed Tortilla fried up crisp yet virtually oilless.

Serving Entrees and Sides as a slow roll-out over the course of thirty minutes it was here that Las Vegas gained yet another entry in the race for best Chicken and Waffles, the \"Almost Boneless\" Breasts pounded out and perfectly tender in golden Batter atop Drop Biscuits taken to the Waffle iron while the Walnut Shrimp and Kung Pao Spaghetti were both on par with any similar plate on Spring Mountain Road, though the later would potentially benefit from a thinner style of Noodle.

Lightening things up a bit with some Greens, the chopped Kale and Apples tossed with Endive, Grapes and Walnuts taken up a notch by bright Vinaigrette, those thinking that Lucky Penny would go 'boring' in its American offerings will be surprised to realize that both the dunkable 'Waffle' Grilled Cheese and Steak Frites with Paprika Fries and herbal Aioli are the sort of thing one might see on the lunch menu at Delmonico, the Margherita Pizza bubbling up with a good blister and leopard spotted underside topped in hand-crushed Tomatoes and imported Buffalo Mozzarella. 

At this point well sated with several unfinished plates boxed as leftovers Chef Kudrak once again stopped by to explain how he did not want Lucky Penny's Desserts to be 'generic,' the decision to instead bring on a full-time Pastry Chef paying immediate dividends not only in terms of the to-go case up front but the menu's opening lineup of Triple Chocolate Cake served with a spiral of Mousse, a piping-hot Chocolate Brownie served with Vanilla Ice Cream and Red Velvet Cookie spokes and the \"Inverted Key Lime Pie\" that would not look out of place on the menu at Yardbird, CUT or even perhaps L'Atelier.

FOUR STARS:  Fulfilling a promise to update The Palms to modern times, and taking a chance in breaking tradition with an entirely new 24/7 concept despite the obvious success of Grand Café across several venues, Station Casinos appears to have a winner on its hands with Lucky Penny, the 'necessary' Hotel dining option doing more than just satisfying its role and actually presenting several dishes on par with restaurants nearly twice its pricepoint in an environment that is both casual and inviting."}
{"text":"The lucky penny is chic and provides a light and embellished atmosphere. The lighting is bright and fits the white and yellow tones, really providing an uplifting place to enjoy your food. My favorite part of the meal, I'm skipping straight to dessert, was the cookie/ice cream dish. This put pazooki's to shame. It's red velvet browniesque goodness tingles your soul.
The service was awesome and our server was very conversational. You could tell she was aware of when to let us quietly enjoy our meal, and also when we were just sitting back, taking a break, and looking at each other to start a conversation. 
Really a cute cafe and a great addition to the palms. 
Just a plus, the manager came to our table multiple times to check on us and make sure we were completely satisfied. Worth the time and definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"My first time eating here and it was for breakfast. I had the American Breakfast with poached eggs, sausage and toast. The wait for the food was a little longer than anticipated, the service was great and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends and really enjoyed it. We got a couple dishes and split them, so I was able to try the Chicken and Biscuits and one of the pizzas. They were both really good. We also tried out the desserts, the berry cobbler and a brownie sundae. The staff was also very friendly and didn't make us feel awkward about sharing dishes."}
{"text":"I ate here twice on a recent stay at The Palms. The first time was a late night snack after a long day of travel. I had the Loaded Baked Potato Soup and the Gyoza.

The Soup was definitely loaded. Served in a large shallow bowl, the soup was topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Scallions, Cheddar Fries, Poblano Chiles and Fried Onions. It tasted very good, but there were so many Fries that they soaked up too much of the soup. If I get this again, I would order the fries on the side. The Gyoza were perfectly pan fried dumplings with a flavorful filling of Pork, Shrimp and Scallions. I also had a Nitrogen infused Iced Coffee that was smooth and strong.

A few days later, I stopped in for a hangover soothing Breakfast of Oatmeal with Brown Sugar, Walnuts and Dried Cranberries with a side of extra crispy Bacon and an Iced Mocha.

The Staff was friendly and helpful and the Restaurant is very wheelchair friendly, including accessible seating at the counter, which I took advantage of both visits! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Lucky Penny a number of times and give it a high recommend, both on Yelp and to friends as well.  The service is great, very very attentive and helpful with your orders.  The restaurant is recently remodeled and is bright with a hip vibe.

I absolutely love the Pizza salad and the Brussel Sprouts with bonito flakes.  I know there was someone who said they did not like the pizza but I have had the margarita as well and think it is the bomb.com.

Overall, great restaurant and I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing service.  Brittany was so helpful with recommendations and the meal did not disappoint.  5* all around!"}
{"text":"Amazing is a understatement! I came here for my birthday to have breakfast and everyone from the front desk staff to servers to food runners to chefs was absolutely awesome! So nice and accommodating. Michelle was out server and she was great sang happy birthday to me and gave us everything we asked for plus more!! Danny the chef came out because my silly friend wanted to compliment him but it was well deserved our food was outstanding!! I had the salmon and bagel as well as the waffle grilled cheese which was to die for. My friends had cinnamon swirl pancakes and steak and eggs and the lox pizza we were all sharing across the table everything was so good! Love this place definitely coming back tomorrow! Should've stayed at this hotel instead of the rio definitely better service and food than hash a go go"}
{"text":"Very good food especially for being open 24 hours and they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day which is awesome! our server was so nice and upbeat as well I think her name was Charlie? Definitely will be returning. (:"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, what more could you want? If you like Reuben sandwiches then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I had high hopes due to the good rating on Yelp but I was disappointed. We started off by ordering bloody marys and were excited because they had an interesting variety of them on the menu. After almost 15 minutes we still didn't have our drinks so I started looking around for our waitress. She saw me looking for her and went straight to the bar knowing I was probably wondering where the drinks were. After a few more minutes, she finally comes over with them. She sets three down even though we'd only ordered two, told us the bartender messed up and made the wrong one so she was going to give us what we ordered plus the mistake. That's nice but she never said anything like, thanks for waiting almost 20 minutes for your drinks or I'm sorry that took so long. She said nothing. Not even 15 seconds after she set our drinks down, the food arrived. We tasted the drinks and the tomatillo Bloody Mary was delicious but the other two were weird. My boyfriend didn't even drink his or the freebie because they just didn't taste good. Our food was bland. I got the short rib hash and my boyfriend got the eggs benedict. The hash needed quite a bit of salt and pepper and the hollandaise on the benedict was a bizarre consistency. The sauce had clearly broken but they served it anyway. The service was awful overall. Our waitress was never around. She did finally come by and comment that the two bloody marys had not been touched and asked if we liked them. We were honest and said no and she looks at us and says, \"oh\" and walks away. I wish I was making that up but I'm not. One redeeming thing that happened was that a gentleman stopped by our table and asked us for our honest opinions on the drinks because he said they'd been getting mixed reviews and so we told him. (This happened before our waitress stopped by and asked about them). He took the other drink off our bill which we really appreciated. It was a really long, really mediocre experience. Maybe we came on an off day but I won't risk wasting another 50 dollars to find out."}
{"text":"Hidden gem at the Palms! Restaurant is newly renovated very beautifully. The food is excellent for a coffee shop. Their Reuben sandwich was very lean and tasty. My daughter loves the turkey and dressing dish. The fried chicken and waffle was done very well. The desserts are excellent! We ate here (3) times and the service was exceptional! I was so impressed that I left them 30% tip each time!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something different this time in Vegas and boy are we happy we did! We had the Eggs Benny, buffalo wings, Loaded Potato soup and Gingerbread BOozy shake.  It was absolutely amazing! Can't wait to try this place again. We also had great service from a wonderful bartender. I forgot her name but she was from AZ."}
{"text":"Food was good and the room is beautiful but service is terrible (non existent) and little bugs flying around. No thanks."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in the Palms. Love the marble counters and modern decor. Great place to hang out if you're checking out of your hotel early."}
{"text":"Limited variety of menu--- long time took to get the order , bread rolls are extra and food served came cold 
Especially the soup LUKE warm! Overall over priced coffee shop
With exception of new updated decor the place gets too much noice from the blasting radio/ music in the background...made it difficult to have a conversation with out little shouting or able to have background noice from nearby tables...
Sorry disappointed 
Next time grand lux will be my choice..."}
{"text":"This cafe is so well-rounded. They have so many delicious choices and everything exceeded my expectations.

Their breakfast quesadilla was so good I ordered it two mornings in a row! The fresh fruits were super fresh as well as the grapefruit juice- highly recommended.

The Spanish latte I ordered...had too much grinds in the bottom that kinda ruined the flavor for me."}
