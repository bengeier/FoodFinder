{"text":"Really good breakfast. A lot variation of food. Excellent service.prices are pretty fair."}
{"text":"Great local family restaurant featuring breakfast and lunch. I can only vouch for the breakfast. Eggs & country ham was delicious with eggs cooks exactly as ordered. I added the gravy to go with the biscuits for what now is a feast. 

The place has been in business over forty years run now by the second generation. Don't miss this hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast and service! I always order my eggs over well and as a side note I say \"no brown, please\" but) no one heeds to the no brown. In fact, I have just gotten used to over cooked crispy eggs. BUT not here... they were cooked just right and the waitress made sure to ask if they were right. Service and attentiveness this early in the morning? Unheard of. Great prices too. Will be back."}
{"text":"Food is very consistent, customer service is excellent! 
We go here several times a week since our office is a mile away. I'm glad we found this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is the best I have ever had.  Their menu is great for gluten sensitive people.  There is such a selection of good food.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food & service.
Been here for breakfast and lunch, good home cooking.
Good prices also.
Oh, just a note to Dave S; Yes you can mess up breakfast, you been to any of the IHOP's lately?"}
{"text":"Unassuming place off Wilkinson Blvd. near the airport. Cinder block restaurant with a very basic interior. 

I was there on a Wednesday morning for breakfast and after reading some reviews I was expecting fast service, that was not the case. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with hash browns. Not sure how long that takes but it should be less than the 20 minutes I waited. Only 4 other tables occupied so it's not because they were busy. 

Food is decent, again I can only speak of breakfast. In the area it's the best breakfast available. The sandwiches are good sized, the BEC was packed with bacon. The hash browns are the way to go though, very large plate and very good!  

Contrary to other reviews, i'm assuming this recently changed, credit cards and debit cards are accepted and they have an ATM inside. 

Prices are very reasonable for portion size."}
{"text":"While the experience started a bit shaky, had to seat myself and then got served AFTER others who arrived after me (apparently regulars) were served, the experience was overall ok. The food was good, and once the server realize what had happened she apologized profusely and made up for it during the rest of my visit. Good customer service recovery goes a long long way with me. I will come back."}
{"text":"To reiterate what I said in my previous posting dated 12/6/2012: THEY HAVE THE VERY BEST GRILLED CHICKEN PITA YOU WILL EVER EAT!
I have eaten this same item at numerous Greek-owned Restaurants (Showmars, Nikkos Grill, Mr. G's, Maxwell's Tavern in Waxhaw, Athenian Grill in Indian Trail, etc) yet NO ONE can come close to the flavor of this one. It's all about the way they marinate their chicken, as well as the tzatziki sauce and lettuce that they use! The Pita also has onion and tomatoes as well. Do yourself a favor: try theirs, and then compare to any others in Charlotte and surrounding area, and you will understand what I mean!"}
{"text":"I came with my coworkers for lunch today. I liked the flounder and I would recommend it. The black-eyed peas were delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw (too salty). I had to dock them for the macaroni salad (it was awful). One of my coworkers  had the turkey burger which looked phenomenal.  I think would like to try it next time. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place without a tip from a fellow yelper! It's definitely a hidden gem in Charlotte! 

I stopped in for lunch and they were pretty busy! I understood why when I checked out the menu! This place has daily specials and plenty of different options for very reasonable prices. I tried the grilled chicken pita with fries. It was really good! The grilled chicken was so well seasoned! I'd recommend it to anyone. I'm already looking forward to trying more items from this place! 

If you're looking for something new, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a business trip for some breakfast, and ugh, what a disappointment.  I ordered a Western Omelette that was just completely destroyed by imitation cheese.  I really hate when places don't list that they use fake/imitation/crap cheese in their meals, since to me they taste completely terrible and ruin the entire meal.  I was in a hurry in this particular occasion or I would've asked for another plate, and painfully ate as much as I could tolerate, which ended up being about half the omelette.  

What added insult to injury was when I tried to save my taste buds by washing down the fake cheese with the Orange Juice I ordered, that I discovered immediately to be from concentrate, and clearly tasted as such.

What a complete and utter disappointment, it really shows that this place has no pride in their service, and will take any and all shortcuts to make a quick buck.  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was very good and the service was on point. I think they close everyday around 3 but they have a nice selection on the menu. Give them a try if your in West Charlotte.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great little dive/diner. The service is always friendly and attentive. The food is solid, and the prices are very reasonable. 

It's super convenient to Charlotte Douglass Airport. We stop in for breakfast on the mornings we fly in, and lunch on the days we fly out."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant.   Busy but service was great.  I had the grilled tilapia and eggs - EXCELLENT!  Hubby had fried bologna & egg sandwich and he loved it.  

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee is super. Had steak and eggs and it was cool to my liking. Server was great and she came around to check on me. I will be back at this place in my future travels."}
{"text":"Breakfast is reasonably priced. The link sausage had a little heat. Scrambled eggs were ok. Shredded hash browns were plain. A little pepper and Texas Pete helped the eggs and hash browns. Coffee is on the weak side, but an acceptable flavor. Good old fashioned biscuits. No real butter, only the blend is available. Also only 2 flavors of jelly. So that's 2 negatives. Good friendly service. I was waiting to meet someone on a delayed flight and no one tried to rush me out. A big plus. I would come back for breakfast and I would try lunch."}
{"text":"I tried this place and loved it! While the outside may not be fancy the customer service is warm and fuzzy. I tried the black bean and corn veggie burger that was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable soup as a side item is was good but a little to salty for my taste. The coffee is decent and the prices are reasonable. Support this local family owned diner you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food!  A small restaurant we visited while on business and what a nice discovery.  American food served with a smile."}
{"text":"Vouched for this place so many times, even when people's eyebrows raised when I told them it was on Wilkinson Blvd.  Today finally sealed the deal.  For breakfast they served me a plate of three solid black biscuits, the most burnt food I have ever seen in one place in my life.  We said to the waitress \"don't even bother leaving them on the table\" (so fast were they carried away that I didn't even get a picture, but it also would've been excellent to have for people who refuse to read this far, but still need solid irrefutable proof that the cook is totally uncaring and not even worthy of the title of \"cook\").

Oh, and the omelette I also rave about tasted like a bottle of cheese whiz was squirted throughout.

That's it, another restaurant scratched from the list.  There's a reason that only seniors eat here."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Best breakfast around.  The corned beef hash keeps me coming back.  Nice option from a health standpoint to be able to have fish as a breakfast protein.  At least I'm following doctor's orders.  They are very accommodating to children and senior citizens.  Sometimes we have both in the party.  Pray for us."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots in charlotte. Great specials and allways fresh. Not impressive on outside but staff is awesome and food is some of the beat around."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but great food at a good price. Always friendly service. Do take Credit Cards"}
{"text":"We came in after having taken an overnight flight from the West Coast. We were hungry and wanted some quality food at a good price. This was definitely a great spot. The biscuits were yummy  and my hubby really enjoyed the gravy. Alicia our waitress provided us with excellent service. The food is good quality at a good price. The great coffee and Alcia's service earned the fifth star!

Definitely a locals place. Comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"This is a staple for the hard workers on the west side who need and deserve a good reasonably priced breakfast.

The early bird special is just that.....I usually have the 2 eggs scrambled, toast w/ jelly, hash browns and 3 pcs of bacon.

This is a great way to start your day, and the food is always on par.

They are open for breakfast and lunch only, so you need to here by three pm on any weekdays.

Would highly recommend them for lunch as well, especially the beef tips or chicken tips with Rice."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated. Really tasty homemade vegetable soup. I've been going here for probably 25 years and they've never disappointed once. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was very good and our server was great but I'm not sure if they were short staffed or the kitchen staff was slow.  We ordered our food at 12:15 and received our food at 12:50."}
{"text":"While it might look like much from the outside but like they say don't judge a book by its cover good food, good service and good prices would have never thought of coming here if not for yelp"}
{"text":"Listen, this place is not your \"ooh, let's go have a fancy brunch\" place, but it is a solid, good breakfast spot that you won't be disappointed in. I think my husband and I come here every other weekend for breakfast, and there's always a good turnout here.

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, but I will say, every time I get my eggs, they are perfectly cooked! The bacon is always crispy, the hash browns are plentiful, and the coffee isn't terrible. Their French toast is simple, just like how you'd make it at home, but without the hassle and the mess in your own kitchen.  

If you want a good, cheap, simple breakfast, you can't go wrong with Carolina Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great diner food!  Scary location on a run down street with inside nothing to write home about, but the food was excellent.  One of the best I omelets I've ever had.  Great grits and home fries.  Our server, Maria, was a sweetheart and the food was served quickly and hot.  Decent prices, but sadly, no peanut butter on the premises."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for a new breakfast spot. Place was clean and food and reviews looked on yelp so I gave it a shot. I got the Bologna with two eggs and babe got liver mush with two eggs we also both got grits. The food came out outstanding!!! It was amazing but halfway through my food I found two long nasty hairs in my food and the waitress was nice about it she took it off my order and then she admitted it was the cooks arm hair apparently in my food because all other facial hair isn't allowed. Hate this had to happen on my first time trying here. Can't knock the food because it was good but idk if I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Since I have worked in the area for years, running to all the same fast food places gets to be a bit meh. Recently, I had settled for going to Wendy's one dreary day and as I drove down Wilkinson Blvd, I remembered.

 \"Oh, yeah! That place was good. Lemme go there instead!\"

Both times I've come in for lunch, I have been pleasantly surprised. And that's the best feeling ever. Especially on a day when you just want to curl up under your desk and take a nap. I gotta tell you, though. This food is some serious stuff, so it might make you even sleepier once you're all full and happy. 

I know this is going to sound crazy, but my absolute favorite thing here is the lima beans. I don't know when I became such an adulty adult, but I am real serious about the quality of my vegetables now and I think these are the best limas I've had in forever. The meatloaf I had was nicely seasoned and I enjoyed the mashed potatoes as well. The first time, I just went with a burger and fries since I didn't know what to get and it was a good choice, too. Nicely cooked with a good char and the fries were good and hot when I got back to the office!

They have daily specials and I have it on pretty good authority from my coworkers that their breakfast is the tops. I haven't made my way there for it yet, but tomorrow is Friday, so who knows if I'll pull a pop-in. If I do, I'll definitely come back to report!"}
{"text":"Back to update my tenth review. Yes, I've written over seven thousand reviews since I last visited the Carolina Family Restaurant in 2009.

It's still quality inexpensive food, served by friendly wait staff. I opted for a cheese omelet and it was cooked right with plenty of cheese inside. The home fries were good, though perhaps a little overdone as it was closer to lunch time than breakfast time.

Coffee was good and refilled often.

They do now accept credit cards and there's still a great view of the planes landing at nearby CLT."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and looking for a quick lunch before heading to the Billy Graham Library. With the help of Yelp, we decided to give the Carolina Family Restaurant a try. We were not disappointed. Our food came out quickly, it was fresh, and good. I loved the Greek salad with grilled chicken...all at reasonable prices.....No complaints. Already having a favorable opinion of this restaurant,  it was further enhanced by the very nice and friendly lady (perhaps a family member) at the register. She seemed to genuinely appreciate our business."}
{"text":"After pulling up the Yelp app and searching \"food\" I came across this place. So I figured why not... 

This placed put a smile on my face. The lady that was at the register was really nice and helped me on deciding what to try after I informed her that I'd never been there before. I decided to try the meatloaf and a side of rice & gravy, Lima beans and Mac&cheese (it only comes with two sides, but I just wanted to be fancy). 

I waited about 5 minutes before I was handed my food and heading out the door. My food came with one roll and a cornbread muffin. There was a lot of gravy since the meatloaf comes with gravy also. Everything taste like home cooked food which I can definitely appreciate. However, the Mac&cheese wasn't necessarily my favorite. 

Nonetheless, I will definitely visit this place again because the prices are fair, food is good and the staff were friendly. It's a little mom 'n pop place and the outside may not look inviting but don't judge this book by its cover... You should go check this place out."}
