{"text":"I love this store! The people are friendly, the prices are reasonable,  the service is great and I have been happy with every purchase I've made. It's nive to be able to get things like turkey chops that traditional stores don't have.  I will continue to shop here."}
{"text":"I did an over the phone order and I asked for my total the day I ordered my meats they told me they would call with a total well I didn't expect my total to be close to 300.00 and for my lunch meat to be so high since I didn't pay much for the first time I ordered. So I had to get half of my lunch meat vs all. They called me today and just told me they couldn't do no more calls for for me over the phone. Keep in mind it was my first time ever to cancel been going to them for years and never cancel before. Then I am not in Cleveland so I am coming a distance to give my business to them and even had refer friends and family as well. So today they just didn't loose my business but they loosing my family's as well since I was bringing them in. So I wouldn't recommend Kocian Meats they take too long when your inside ordering who has the time to wait 2 hours just for for a number to be called especially if you have to go to work."}
{"text":"Quality meats at amazing prices. Get there early on a Saturday to try to miss the crowd."}
{"text":"I went in here for the first time last week after trying various grocery stores looking for a good flank steak. Kocian's selection of meats is astounding, and they had exactly the cut I was looking for! I got a HUGE piece of flank steak which they tenderized at no charge, and which cooked just perfectly on the grill this weekend. I will definitely be coming back, especially since they have thick-cut rind-on bacon!"}
