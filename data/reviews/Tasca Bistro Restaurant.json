{"text":"We were intrigued by their website advertising 9 different paellas. It was hard to choose. Both my husband and I had paella that came with an appetizer and dessert. We had a hard time eating all that yummy food and weren't in a position to take any leftovers with us. It was a sleeper restaurant off the beaten path and definitely worth the walk."}
{"text":"Portugais classique,avec touches touristiques.menu varie,carte de vins à découvrir,service gentil et professionnel.plats bien exécutés,portions copieuses,le tout reste un peu rustique ce qui est habituel pour la cuisine portugaise"}
{"text":"Have to agree with Gracie R.! Having grown up in Portugal and moving to NY, I find that it's really hard to find good Portugese cuisine. Tasca definitely reminds me of home whenever I come to visit my relatives in Montreal! 

The food is really authentic and the service is great too!"}
