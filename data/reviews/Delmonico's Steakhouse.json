{"text":"The food was good but the place was so noisy that my wife and I could not have a conversation at a small table for two.  The staff was very nice and moved us to a somewhat quieter area but whoever laid out the restaurant did a poor job.  My suggestion would be to either get the food to go or to request a table at the very back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The scallop appetizer was absolutely amazing and made my forced work trip to Cleveland during the RNC *almost* worth it. Highly recommend that dish...everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"This was a celebration dinner and it totally topped the day. Ashley, our server was outstanding. I had the filet and lobster and it was one of the best dinners I have ever had! Thanks for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I love the Caesar salad with a piece of grilled salmon. It compliments the salad and the anchovies, it is always good. The whole experience is great starting at the front desk which is staffed by friendly personable folks, that are always friendly yet professional. Every one of my guests comments about how they were made to feel welcome coming through the front door.  Great staff and some good food, don't miss the stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. But, I don't eat steak!  Love the service, food, decor, location...."}
{"text":"Had a great waiter, Cullen, fabulous dinner but was cautioned on the phone about a dress code.  We were 5 professional ladies dressed for proper executive attire.  Not sure what their \"proper dress\" would be since the table next to us had a gentlemen with a suit and four adult guests in shorts and jeans.  We were in the main dining room.  I always return for dinner but wonder about their dress code. Rita"}
{"text":"The place was about what I expected. The decor and service were on par for a nice steakhouse, pretty nice wine list. Had the lobster bisque, which was good, but not excellent. Ribeye was cooked just right and was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Best steak i have ever had. Service was perfect, food cooked to perfection. It is a big step up from my usual dinner at outback. It was very expensive but you get what you pay for. I would visit only once a year because of the price. But it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a very high end restaurant and has been for years.  Twice now I have come back because it is a convenient location to meet friends.  The food is terrible!!! I mean terrible.  I could cook better.  I had the veal stuffed peppers and my friend had the chicken marsala.  Both were bland and overcooked.  Very disappointed in this nice place.  The wait staff was very good."}
{"text":"Fairly over rated for a steakhouse.   Their lobster Bisque is good but steaks are not prime and they are very overpriced.   Lunch salads are small and flavorless.   Nice spot for business lunch but would never go here on a date."}
{"text":"salmon was delicious- one of the best I've had! the restaurant is very nice inside and they brought a cake for a member of our party's birthday. strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Delmonico has the best happy hour.  The food is wonderful, the service is exceptional, the management is hands on, the environment is cozy yet upscale. Everytime I have been there I have had an excellent experience weather on a Saturday night date or a business mtg"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner before a night out at Playhouse Square. This was our first time here, but it definitely won't be the last!  The restaurant has nice ambiance, the service was outstanding, and my wife and I both loved our meals. My wife had the seared Fluke, a special, and I had the three course tenderloin and shrimp meal.   If you are trying Delmonico's for the first time, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was great but evrything else sucked. It's a steak house, it doesn't need to try too hard, it doesn't need to try to be cute. I got the steak and shrimp, which came with mashed potatos and asparagus. That seems standard and easy for a steak house right? How can you mess that up? Well, Delmonico's found a way. The steak was cooked perfectly, but the shrimp were hard, overcooked, and tasteless. And hey Delmonico's, if I wanted my asparagus jammed through my shrimp like a harpoon through a dolphin I would have asked for them like that. Don't make me look like an asshole while I struggle to remove my vegatables from my crustaceans like a damn caveman. Does that actually look good to anybody by the way? Like that's the best you idiots could come up with to serve a simple plate of steak and shrimp? FFS, just put all the peices on the pkate and let me eat them like the capable human being that I likee to believe that I am. Also, you can't wear hats in the dining room... Get over yourselves Delmonico's, you're not the nice of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were exceptional. Dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives were a great start to our meal. My hubby had the special, a bone in filet. I had the surf and turf. All excellent. The downside was the service. That is what dropped the rating 2 stars. The servers were nice and friendly but not attentive at all. We were actually forgotten, for a significant amount of time. The asparagus was left off my plate, the manager commented that someone should have noticed. That pretty much sums up the service, someone should have noticed.  If they had I could have rated my experience 5 starts."}
{"text":"Lobster Bisque---more bisque than lobster, but amazing flavor..   Great food, good service I'd make my way back!"}
{"text":"ok, the place is a bit stuffy and maybe a little loud? But, the food is always excellent as is the service.  Never had a meal there that wasn't at least very good.  I'm there weekly, I like  the bar staff, the only negative is it's a bit stuffy but hey everyone has their niche."}
{"text":"Simply Devine.... I have eaten at David Burke's , Peter Luger's , Smith and Wollensky's and every other top steakhouse you can name and this is right at the top. I had the Chairman Of The Board and Lobster Mashed.. flawless flavor and perfect presentation.. if I had to find something wrong with the meal I couldn't .. it was our first visit bump not near our last."}
{"text":"I had company from out of town on Saturday the 28th of June. I must say the valet attendant was very rude to me as I stepped out of the car with a broken foot. Our other party was in the car behind me and came out to help me out of the car he made a remark to us and said , this is for valet parking only etc. We proceeded into the restaurant and the host ask us how many people, we said six and he replied well I'm going to have to look around because I don't want to have to separate you. There was not very many people in the restaurant so we were very confused about his comments. When all he needed to say is, it will be a few minutes can you please be seated.  He was very rude to us. The manager came over to us and ask us what is wrong and she decided to side with the host and told us to leave. I had very important people from out of town that is used to five star treatment in five star fabulous restaurant's. Needless to say Delmonico Steak house was very rude from the time we stepped out of our car all the way to the hostess and very disappointed in the manager. I feel Delmonico Steak house on Quarry needs to hire a staff that is courtesy and professional. Especially since the restaurant was not very full and could have accommodate us nicely.  I will never go to Delmonico Steak house on Quarry again. I will also pass this on to all my friends as well."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere was very loud.  Prices were a bit much for the quality of the overall experience."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was that classy before going. My boyfriend and I felt underdressed, but it wasn't crowded at all, it was almost empty around 8pm. We weren't immediately greeted at the door, it took a few minutes. Our waiter was a really friendly guy, but through the course of the night we had so many different people come to our table that we almost forgot who our actual waiter was.  We were sitting there hungry for almost 20 minutes after we ordered. They brought out half of what we ordered, a salad and the lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is the best I've had so far. I found it very strange that they finally brought out our bread when we were almost done. Our main entree finally came out, but by that time we were full, it took a very long time and hardly anyone was there. My bf's chicken parm pasta was HUGE! And they put large pieces of anchovies on my caesar salad.  I wouldn't say it's expensive, but it is pricier than other popular \"italian\" restaurants. I don't think we would go back, but it was cool to go once."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and was treated like gold. Hostess was super, not giving me grief over needing a booth with a power outlet, taking straight to one. Good was top notch. Steak and tiger shrimp dish was more than filling. Make sure you try the special butter for the bread, not sure what it was but it made my night."}
{"text":"This place is the best of the best - by far my favorite spot in all of Cleveland. Every time I visit I leave more impressed than the previous time - great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"You have amazing steak. I would always rather eat there than bone fish and outback Easssssssssssssssssssssssy dub"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for happy hour after reading the \"five olives\" reviews from the Plain Dealer.  The place was fancier than I had expected.  I did feel somewhat under-dressed in jeans, but I wasn't going to let the \"proper attire required\" sign on the front door scare me away.  The happy hour (3p-6p) deals were pretty good, and especially so considering the prices on the regular dinner menu.  $5.50 for a cheeseburger and fries, $2.50 for a Peroni, and they even brought warm bread with pesto butter to the table.  The cheeseburger was fine, nothing special.  The fries were good.     I could be wrong, but this feels like the kind of place where people only go because they want to impress (business clients, dates, in-laws, etc.), not because they actually want to eat here.  I would go back for happy hour since I live so close, but I wouldn't say it's worth going out of your way for, at least for happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. Steaks are awesome, and also try the calamari appetizer. Fish dishes are also a great choice."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a must! I ordered a pomegranate vodka drink w pineapple jce & it was delicious.($4). Ordered the 4 oz. filet, shrimp, mashed potatoes, & asparagus. Delicious. Got there at 5, no waiting & service was great. Most of their desserts are made in house. So, I had to try one. Had a hard time deciding, so I choose lemon ricotta pound cake w creme fraise w strawberries, blueberries, & blackberries. Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Happy Hour. Enjoyed 3 shrimp and a 4oz filet for less than $15. Good bargain!  Bartender, Vinnie, was helpful.  F"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food was wonderful. The staff was warm welcoming and very professional.  I have food allergies they bent over backwards to make sure I never got anything that would harm me.  To the extreme,  the manager saved me. I will be back as soon as I can afford it as it is a bit pricey. But worth every penny."}
{"text":"I had a fight with a guy I've been seeing, a nasty dragged tearful fight that took over our work days, through phone calls and texts. When I reluctantly agreed to hang out with him that night, and told him in a haughty tone I didn't care if he cooked or we went out, he clearly took the hint and we came here for dinner. When we pulled into the driveway, it was a shared driveway with the Denny's that sits in front of this place, and I was about to pitch a fit, so hey, there's a funny thing to do to a girl when you take her out to dinner, pretend you're pulling into Denny's. She'll feel like an ass.   It was a Thursday, 9pm, and the Delmonico's dining room was completely empty except for us and two middle aged women. My date was wearing a hoodie and I had the messy look of a loose angry girl, so our server probably underestimated our steakhouse savvy, but that's fair. He ordered a martini and I ordered a Hunter, which was rye and cherry brandy. We were both obviously determined to get drunk.  The drink selection was fairly good. There was the omnipresent Moscow Mule (they are breeding like rats, and let's face it, they are the new rum and coke)  but the Hunters cocktail and the Manhattan Noir I had later were both good and balanced, and most importantly strong. You must always sip a strong drink at a steakhouse, it goes best with the mellow lighting.   Our server warmed up to us when my date started debating between a seafood tower and a steak, or both. I guess realizing that the two hipster looking kids are going to drop at least a hundred easy is probably a relief when it's the end of your shift and these two are going to keep you past close. He ended up with some huge 42 oz bone-in monstrosity the server hand sold him, and I got the 7 oz center cut,  done Christopher, because I'm not a caveman and I hate bones. It makes the whole meal seem so skeletal.   I ordered mine medium, because when I ordered my normal medium rare, the server made sure to describe exactly what that was going to mean and remind me I was at an actual steakhouse where they actually care about temp and I really didn't want it rare rare. It came out exactly how she said it would, perfectly pink and bloody in the center but with none of that gelatinous chew I hate about raw. The bearnaise sauce is a good call if you love sopping up pools of blood juice and cream, which honestly if you don't, you shouldn't be there in the first place.  My friend ordered his Pittsburgh rare, and while to me it looked a little overdone, he was happy with it. The garlic mashers that came with mine were acceptable, they weren't special, but how many times can potatoes be special? The house salad were huge. The bread was a bit hard. But the steaks, which are the whole reason you come to steakhouse, were great.  Also I learned the term Pittsburgh rare, which should totally be a band name.   We were the last to leave at 10:30, and to her credit, the server didn't mention it to us at all, and even tried to sell us on dessert, offered us coffee. I think that's the best customer service point I can give them, that no matter what you show up looking like, they treat you with the same amount of respect.   Verdict: the perfect place to randomly take a girl you've been fighting with if you want to get laid later."}
{"text":"The steak was not seasoned properly.  The veggies overcooked.  Garlic potatoes were average.  Now the merlot was very smooth  and to die for.  The service was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This is a very conflicted review.....  I found myself here as the idea was to hit a Friday night movie after a decent dinner. Due to poor planning, we ended up here.   Upon entering the establishment, I found it to be the stereotypical entirely too dark, 80's-esque styling, with mostly transplants from the 80's dining here. I'm in my mid-to-late 30's and I felt young and in-touch here....  Let's get to what matters though...the wait staff and hostesses were all great. I can;t complain at all about that. The $110 bill for two isn't even a complaint....I knew what I was getting myself into in that respect. The complaint was with the food itself.  I really wanted the soft-shell crab that was on special. I knew it wasn't meant to be an entree so I ordered it with some custom sides and there was a steak being shared a but anyhow. Seemed like a win win for me....     - The crab was deep-fried (as expected) but it seemed to have been deep-fried with some new technique using cold oil because the crab had more grease dripping from it than my 77 Jag sitting in the parking lot.....was just gross and I couldn't eat it (and I'll finish anything, regardless of how gross it is).      - The risotto had a great taste to it, but was definitely way overdone.....mushy.      - The pork belly appetizer was WAAAY overdone. They may as well given us crispy bacon, honestly.     - The steak was just ok....on the verge of good. Charred well in most places but not quite aged and/or from good stock....something just not quite there.   I may try again but it's tough with places like these as one usually doesn't want to throw that kind of money at a chance....."}
{"text":"Nice steakhouse mid-way btwn Akron and Cleve.  WARNING: Very poor selection of French wines to accompany the marvelous steaks.  Why?....hard to tell.   Busy/Loud bar area.  Part of the Hospitality Restaurant group, among Cleveland's best.   Reliable, great quality, usually excellent service.  Now about those Bordeaux...."}
{"text":"Pretty good, had the NY steak, which was cooked perfect. Service was great, I would come back again"}
{"text":"Very good steakhouse. It's a little pricey but the high quality food and atmosphere make up for it. This place can be casual but more on the business casual side. I wouldn't walk in here wearing shorts. They make excellent cocktails and have a nice wine selection too. The bar area is usually crowded in the early evening so you might wait a little for service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was excellent service was superb. Any time in Cleveland I would recommend Delmonicos Steakhouse. I had the surf and turf she had the scallops and the lobster bisque was exquisite."}
{"text":"I seriously debated giving this place a 1 star, but I figured just because our waitress was terrible doesn't mean they all are.   The service- worst I've ever had, no joke.  There were 2 waitress.  You would think that means you'd get double the service...wrong.  I think by having two, each thought the other was taking care of us.  So here were the highlights (besides for being the slowest service ever).   Upon ordering our waitress raised her eyebrows, as in to say \"why are you ordering such a big steak, you fat ass\". When the table full of golfers came in, our service basically stopped.  They wouldn't even come over when we were trying to get their attention.  They promised a free dessert for my dad's birthday.  Chocolate cake or Cheesecake.  My dad ordered chocolate.  Guess what he got 25 minutes later? They never even bothered to take our dessert orders until the birthday dessert already came out.  The hell if I\"m going to wait another 25 minutes.    So did the food at least measure up?  NOPE.  You figure at $30-$50 a steak, it'd at least be decent.  I'd really prefer one of the chain steak restaurants.  My steak wasn't even cooked right, but I didn't bother to say anything considering the length of time it took to get the first one.   Furthermore my mashed potatoes tasted comparable to instant and my lobster tail was overcooked and not even served with clarified butter.    Ok.  Maybe I should have gone with one star.  I just hate to be so negative based on one visit.  However, I will certainly never go back again.   Oh and did I mention my \"glass\" of wine was seriously under poured."}
{"text":"Friendly good service.  Food is always predictable.  Like the space between tables. You can actually have a conversation and hear in there!!"}
{"text":"Another nice experience at Delmonico's. My party enjoyed the calamari and bocce balls appetizers, and I had the house salad and seared scallops for lunch. Delicious!  Our server was very nice and very attentive.  The scallops were perfectly prepared and I loved the fingerling potatoes and veg that accompanied. I appreciated that the truffle cream sauce was placed on one side of the plate, rather than smothering the entire dish. Since it was a special occasion, I indulged in a semi-custom cocktail - a shot of Tito's added to their refreshing cucumber and ginger beer drink. I also indulged in the oversized creme brûlée for dessert - perfection!  It was everything a trip to an Italian steakhouse should be: decadent and delightful!"}
{"text":"Just a little happy hour action! Always good to know good happy hours deals throughout the city. Delmonico's has a pretty good one. I know people may typically come here for dinner but I would highly recommend coming for a happy hour visit. Check out the food and drink menu for   The happy hour at the Independence location below! Also pictured is a watershed Manhattan!"}
{"text":"Note: this is only a review of the desserts and drinks. We did not eat dinner here  While campaigning for the democratic primaries, we were staying the Doubletree hotel nearby. Delmonico's is just down the street. After eating dinner in downtown Cleveland and coming back to the hotel, I had a hunkering for dessert. I always do....I need dessert to finish my meal. The place where we ate dinner didn't have any desserts and so, we decided to come back to our hotel and check out Delmonico's  The decor is old school Italian. Beautiful wood floors and seating arrangements. Ambient lighting. Reminded me of those old school Italian restaurants in NYC. Nice!!  We went there around 10:30PM and surprised to know that they serve a full menu until 11:30PM. Awesome! We sat at the bar and browsed through the menu. A typical steakhouse menu with lots of meat and  an abundant sea food selection.   We ordered dessert, I got the flourless chocolate cake and he got the goat cheesecake. We debated if it should be called goat cheese cheesecake or just goat cheesecake? I opted for the latter because there seemed to be too many \"cheesy\" words in the former. Regardless of our language skills, both desserts were phenomenal. The goat cheesecake came with a buttery graham crust that melted in your mouth. My flourless chocolate cake was decadent and rich.   I ordered a cosmo, he had scotch on the rocks. My drink was well prepared.   I'll definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went in randomly on a rainy date night after a movie....   \"In The Still Of The Night\" by Jo Stafford played overhead  on Sunday's you can get a prix fix dinner for $29! That includes an appetizer (I got the Italian wedding soup with orzo & veal), an entree with sides (sautéed mushroom and onion strip steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus), plus a dessert (flourless chocolate cake*).  The staff, service, food and atmosphere were great!   If I had to chose Flemings or here, I'd go back to Delmonico's again and again and again!  *tasted/smelled like they used alcohol in the chocolate sauce, but it was still delicious!   ....Since being pregnant I feel I should warn other expecting moms about these things lol, but if you don't care, enjoy the chocolate hot mama!   We left as \"Call Me Irresponsible\" by Frank Sinatra sang"}
{"text":"My boss recommended Delmonico's for a business lunch, and it was excellent.  I had a very fresh piece of halibut and it was cooked to perfection.  The Caesar's Salad was outstanding as well, and they even brought me extra anchovies.  The service was very good, except the refills on the iced tea was a little slow.  Overall, I am a fan, and look forward to going there for dinner to try a Delmonico!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Delmonicos with my guest !! I have been going there for several years and have always enjoyed my dining experience(s) each and every time!! The wine selections are amazing and the food is cooked to perfection !! The price is very reasonable for what you get in quality and fine dining !! A special thanks to Mr Kelan who takes extra care to ensure my guest and me always have a great time !! Thank You !! DR MD"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. It's pricey but worth it.... especially if you get the lobster bisque, filet mignon and flourless chocolate tort. Wish there was more parking.   Also, I always dress up when I go here (dinner does amount to around $100 for two people) but every time I go, the majority of customers are in jeans and polos. Kind of a buzzkill when you shell out that much for food."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night. Server was very knowledgeable. We had calamari as the appetizer which was average (maybe a little chewy). Also tried the lobster bisque which was great.   I ordered the Delmonico steak medium cooked which was delicious. My date ordered the Steak Christopher which she also enjoyed. Half off bottle of Italian wine was a nice treat. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Our bill was $110 before tip which I expected. I would go back again if I had no other options and wanted a good steak"}
{"text":"I love trying the hospitality group restaurants when I am in town. I have been to 3 of them now, but this is by far my least favorite. My husband and I stopped in for lunch. The service was great, but the food was mediocre. And my glass had lipstick on it that was NOT MINE. Meaning my cup was DIRTY. DISGUSTING. (And no, they didn't comp the drink even, which I think would be the polite thing to do.)  I had the Tenderloin Oscar- twin medallions with lump crab, béarnaise sauce and whipped potatoes. It was pretty bland, which is a bummer, because it was the thing on the menu I was most excited about. (See my review of Ruth's Chris in Indianapolis if you want to try this dish done right.)  My husband had a lunch trio of chicken and corn chowder (his fave of the meal), a wedge salad with WAY too much dressing, and a BBQ swordfish sandwich that didn't taste like anything but bbq. Not great, but it wasn't too expensive.  Let's put it this way: we could have spent our $50 in a better way, but if it were half the price we would have still not been impressed.  Such a bummer!"}
{"text":"I would like to praise the service I received at Delmonico's. I took my family out for my dad's 50th birthday. Frankly, we were getting frustrated because our food was taking a really long time to come out. It was a busy night for them so I try not to say much. After over an hour of waiting, we were getting hungry and impatient. The manager, Sarah, came out and repeatedly apologizing for the delay. The second time she came out, she informed us that it was unacceptable that we were waiting for so long. She proceed to comp all of our meals. I kept insisting that she didn't have to do that but she just wanted to take care of us properly. It was the kindest gesture. I will definitely come back another time and give them another try just because the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Delmonico's after he kept hearing reviews for it on the radio. We went on a Sunday, which was kind of nice because it was pretty quiet for us. I loved listening to all of the Crooners playing. It was nice to hear some classic Rat Pack music.   Our waitress, and anyone who served us was very polite and kind. Our food was very good, but nothing extra ordinary in my book. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll probably return, but it wasn't \"the best\" anything I've ever had. We'll probably return whenever we're deciding to have a more expensive night out."}
{"text":"I really liked that they had a mini steak dinner.  It was just perfect for me. I also had a yummy chocolate stout for dessert."}
{"text":"The environment is great inside the restaurant, I love the decor. I got the featured bone-in Delmonico steak, which was pretty good.  While I asked for it charred, they just didn't do it, but the steak was still good.  My wife got the filet and it tasted better than my steak, the season on hers was great.   The Mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes were very good.  I feel this is a good steak restaurant for Cleveland, but in the grand scheme of things it is not earth shatteringly great.   Good date night restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for a Father's Day dinner so it was a family shindig affair. Made reservations and hostess was nice enough to sit me first since the other party hasn't arrived yet. The server was nice enough to show me some wine recommendations and what they had for their special. I was able to sample their wine before ordering which was also a nice gesture.   My dad got their lamb and he was a bit disappointed due to how it was made. He believes the meat was fried and pan fried again because he could see all the oil dripping from its bone. The waiter also said this dish specifically came with 2 sides which included what's on the bottom of their list and what's labeled as \"complementary\". So I ordered their broccoli and lobster ravioli for my dad.   Everyone else ordered their Prix Fare deal which was $10 off of $35 for a 3 course meal which came with soup, entree and dessert. Their wedding soup was a bit salty and their veal balls were dry. The broth tasted like it was loaded with tons of their tomatoes, squash, herbs and so forth so it was tolerable for me.   Our main entrees - Steak Christopher - which is just 2 steak medallions with mashies and asparagus wrapped in 2 jumbo shrimp. According to the people who ordered this dinner, they mentioned that they meat was rather tough and dry. It could have used more seasoning in my opinion. The Walleye was good but the vegetable medley was poor. According to the person who ordered it, the beans were out dated and they could add more a variety of this medley instead of just roasted tomatoes and green beans. For my entree, I ordered their Shrimp and Scallop Risotto. I gotta say I was completely satisfied with this dish. The risotto didn't taste too heavy or overcooked. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly.   For dessert, we all practically got their Creme Brulee, chocolate torte, and tiramisu cake. The creme brulee was way overcooked in terms of burning the sugar because it took more effort to break the surface which in other places, this task should be flawless. The tiramisu on the other hand tasted spoiled. What kind of nice restaurant has spoiled cakes. When the bill came, the waiter said he took the dessert off and plus, the mistake of the 2 sides were also taken off the bill.   This place is way too classy and nice so great to celebrate a special occasion here."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for 25th Anniversary dinner. Everything was great! Next time I'm going to have the filet, my wife had it and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great salads. Enjoyed the wood plank salmon. Great service. Very attentive. Nice Independence, Ohio dining."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and stopped here on a Saturday night.  We did not have a reservation, so there was a very short wait (10 minutes).   We were seated in a quaint corner.   We proceeded to order cocktails, I had the Pomegranate Smash, which I must say was pretty tasty.   I also ordered the Prix Fixe special, which allows the diner to choose from a set 3 course menu.  I opted for the wedge salad, shrimp & scallop saute and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.   The wedge salad was huge, fresh lettuce, thick cut bacon crumbles, red onion and chopped hardboiled eggs drizzled with thousand island dressing and fresh ground black pepper....very tasty.   The main entree included a citrus-fennel risotto and asparagus.  I asked if I could substitute garlic mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.   The mashed potatoes were home-made, rich and flavorful.  The sprouts were cooked perfectly, roasted with a little bit of bacon and onion.  The shrimp and scallops were divine!   Both were tender, juicy and very fresh.   The flourless chocolate cake was the perfect ending to a great meal.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I met a friend here tonight to visit and catch up with each other. After a long day we were both starving. While waiting (forever) for a table we decided to check out the menu to see what we wanted so we could order ASAP when we sat down. My friend told our waiter that we were ready to order because we were really hungry, yet he talked over us and started telling us the specials. Really!? We told you we were ready...I ordered the Chicken Parm, and it's probably the worst I've ever had. No flavor, hardly any sauce and the chicken was rubbery. I asked for another side of sauce and he brought me the tiniest ramekin possible. What am I supposed to do with this dollop of sauce? I really appreciate attentive servers, but these people were constantly at our table. CONSTANTLY! My friend got asked 4 times if they could take her plate away and box up the leftovers. That's 3 times too many. She'll let you know when she's done. It's like they were rushing us out. All we wanted to do is relax and enjoy some good food, and we didn't get that. I think I'll stick with Fleming's or Maggiano's."}
{"text":"This place is very very nice.  I came here for dinner with several bosses, so the pressure was on.  But that did not deter me from feasting on the scrumptious food!  We arrived a little early, so we had a seat at the bar.  The bartenders served very quickly and were sure to inform us of the happy hour specials that were due to expire in five minutes.    Once the rest of our party arrived, we were seated.  Everything on the menu looked great (they had a rather expansive menu for a steakhouse, in my opinion), so I had a hard time choosing.  Rather than ordering a plain steak, which I am liable to do when ordering at a steakhouse, I tried something different.    I had the Tuscan Tournedos which was made up of two little pieces of filet mignon over a big garlic crouton with pesto, over mashed potatoes accented by some toasted tomato relish and artichoke.  The kicker were the two scrumptious pieces of homemade mozarella cheese.  It was absolutely perfect.  My steak was cooked perfectly.    It was a very nice meal.  I would have to say pretty close to five stars, but not quite.  The service was good, the food was delicious.  But just not quite five stars.  That being said, I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse! The name had me but the menu was more extensive than I thought. We came to celebrate a birthday so we had a delicious dinner. The atmosphere was classy. Friendly and accommodating staff. I needed to push my reservation back a half hour and they were very pleasant on the phone and said it was no problem. Impressive for a busy Saturday evening. The valet was great too. I had on heels so he was there to assist since the parking lot had a bit of a slant. They are conveniently located in Independence close to hotels and shops. The prices were fair and the food was outstanding. I had lobster bisque and tail that was cooked to perfection and made me a repeat customer. I'll be back for sure. This is the perfect spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"Food wasn't awful, but several dishes were off - which obviously should not he the case given the tier/price point of the place.  Got the rib eye, it was ok but nothing exciting, would not go back."}
{"text":"Don't judge the book by its cover-- great steakhouse in Independence!    The exterior needs a serious update, as it resembles something from the 1980's. Had I not gone inside to eat, I would have never guessed how nice it actually was.   I came for a work lunch and we wanted something a little more upscale than the predominantly  casual establishments Independence has to offer. The inside has a traditional, classy feel with cozy booths/ seating and darker lighting.   It was around Christmas the place was pretty busy for lunch. I ordered the filet (tasted great!) and my coworkers had lobster bisque and sirloins that they both said was delicious. They especially enjoyed the bisque.  There was nothing left on any of our plates. Even the bread was garlicky and yummy.    I have worked in Independence for 3 years and never been but if I was craving a steak and something with a nicer feel for lunch, I would go back. They have some pretty decent menu options for both lunch & dinner."}
{"text":"Delmonico is in trouble.  If their product and service continues like this. 1) Bartender does not know how to make a proper extra dry vodka martini.  2).  Bartender is defensive.  Argumentative.  Not to mention NOT very personable.  3).  Steak was \"select\" quality maybe choice at best.  4).  Risotto was bland (yet unbelievably overly salty) and overcooked.  Risotto was definitely mush.  You could not distinguish the grains.  It was like porridge (see photo).  Thursday night - we were the only two in resistant at 9:00 pm."}
{"text":"To start off their location is great! Near all of the nice hotels and their valet guys are great once you get there :) They have nice outdoor, bar, and restraunt seating.  The food was absolutely phenomenal and service was top notch. Very relaxing classy place. One of my gfs got put on glutton free by her Dr. Her and I split a slice of glutton free chocolate cake and it was out of this world! Very fudge like and perfect. I highly recommend their baked potatoes too Mmmm! I'm drooling writing this review! Will be back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"recently, i treated my girlfriend to a birthday dinner here.  as being a place i had heard good things about, i wanted to check it out.  we arrived around 830ish and were seated promptly.  our server, jeremy, was extremely knowledgeable and courteous...upon knowing it was our first time and the occasion, he provided excellent choices for wine and entree selections.  we started with the appetizers of crab cake, lobster bisque & a glass of wine...which was 1/2 off.  the crab cake was pretty good (not the best ive had but good nonetheless) and the bisque was great, flavorful & rich.  for the entree we had the ribeye (tough choice between that and the cowboy steak) and the surf & turf.  what i love most is that delmonico's doesnt go thru the whole artsy \"presentation\" effect of the plate.  you want a steak, here's a steak, w mashed potatoes.  \"eat up.\"  the steak...perfectly done.  no complaints here.  here's where i have to give the restaurant knocks.  we were seated on the patio, which was chilly.  our food did take longer than normal to come out, and when it did, our server was very apologetic and offered to make an adjustment on the bill.  the manager came over and \"took care of it\"...more on this momentarily.  another point, one of the bussers made it known that he was waiting for us to finish so he could get our table cleaned and set.  not a fan of that.  back to the manager...when i say he \"took care of it\"...he went far beyond that!  with everything ordered, a $120 bill turned into $21...yes, thats right, $21!  what a way to make an impression.    havent been back for time reasons, but i will go back...food was very good, and obviously i dont expect another comp like that, but its worth a second try."}
{"text":"I have to start this off by saying that for this review I am comparing this restaurant to other high-end steakhouses, not to your average place. Compared to Outback Steakhouse, this place is about 7 stars, but compared to a place like Red The Steakhouse, it's just okay.  The atmosphere is pretty nice, though the location seems a little bit odd. It's surrounded by gas stations, Bob Evans, some rundown buildings, etc, but once you're inside it's nice. The wait staff is very good and the service was very attentive, but for a place that is trying to be a high-end steakhouse, the service seem rather unprofessional at times, even from the manager. This could be due to the fact that I went with several friends, and we were all about 21 years old, so we were younger than their normal crowd, but we came to a place like this to be treated with more respect and class like their older clientele.  The food was also very good, but again, compared to some other in its class, the steaks were cooked wonderfully, but they didn't blow me away with their tenderness and juiciness. The appetizers and sides were well prepared but didn't have the intricate depth of flavor I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  Everything here is very good, but I was honestly a little disappointed by everything relative to its peers. I still think the best steakhouse is Red's by far."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with Delmonico's.  For all the nice atmosphere and excellent service, the food is average in this price range.  Good, but not great steak, good, but not great side.  I asked for green beans rather than the mixed vegetables, and they came out nearly raw without any seasoning what so ever.  The risotto was a bit dry although it had good flavor."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing been here three times so far, yes it is pricey but it is so good, the service is top notch you can witnessed what a waiter/waitress is supposed to do and said with the annoyance of asking patrons what they order this people know their trade which is not easy at all. The porterhouse steak I ordered was the best and the lobster mashed potato was amazing, first time there we had a little incident with our drinks but they were on the house and this was a really nice touch. Come here for a really special occasion like your anniversary or birthday you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Wow..! What a great place.. food and serve were amazing, nicest bar in the area, and amazing staff..  No matter what you order here, it's worth it..!"}
{"text":"Delmonico's is quite a place. Top-of-the-line decor and flawless service which is to be expected for a top-shelf steakhouse.  I had the Certified Angus 7-ounce cut filet. It was an excellent steak. However, I have made better at home by starting with quality meat from a quality butcher. I'm not complaining, mind you - there was nothing wrong with it; it just did not rock my world.  The mixed greens salad was, on the other hand, awesome. The baked potato was incredible and as large as as softball. Then again, for ten bucks, it had better be incredible.  The service was superb but there was one thing that struck both my business colleague and me as odd: We were served bread and butter (excellent, too). But after having one piece each, before our dinners were brought out, the waiter took the remaining bread and butter way without asking if we were done with it. No big deal, really. But odd.  We did not have wine or other alcoholic beverages. Two dinners with salads and baked potatoes came to a cool hundred bucks.  I would definitely go back and probably try a prime delmonico next time. All-in-all, a very nice experience - just not quite five stars."}
{"text":"In honor of former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, known to eat at Independence-area steakhouses four times a week, I decided to grab one of the tables by the bar on a weekday night sans reservations to experience a glimpse of the high life and come to my own verdict.  I passed the free valet parking and instead grabbed a parking spot a scant 20 paces or so from the door.  Once inside, I was warmly greeted by a host and equally warmly greeted by the restaurant interior:  Not an intimate environment, but still comfortable and classy with high thirteen-foot ceilings, spacious and comfortable booths (a Dimora requisite?), and a soothing red glow from the bar lighting that pervaded the entire restaurant along with the ever-present buzz of conversation from the bar patrons.  The wine list is probably less extensive than its peer area steakhouses, but it did feature an inordinately large and impressive selection of oversized bottles--from 1.5 liter magnums to monstrous 15 liter Nebuchadnezzars.  I got a Noir Manhattan and studied the menu.  I started with the Sea Scallops appetizer--two small and rubbery scallops surrounded by bland butternut squash gnocchi.  The dish was then \"sprinkled\" with fried sage (not bad) and ten tiny bacon-bit-sized pieces of pancetta (yes, I counted them).  The whole thing was then covered with maple butter sauce, as if acknowledging the dish's shortcomings and making a last ditch effort to salvage some of the effort.  Definitely opt for another appetizer (which one, though, I have no idea...).  Slightly better but still short of the mark was the \"Award-Winning Lobster Bisque.\"  The award they are referring to was clearly given for most cream in a lobster bisque.  In my opinion, though, the extra heaviness did nothing to accentuate the lobster, so the bisque really wasn't much of an improvement, if any improvement at all, over the lobster bisque offerings at other area steakhouses.  While Dimora was known to go for a 23 oz. cowboy steak at Delmonico's, I opted for a nice 14 oz. USDA Prime Delmonico steak served medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak was clearly overcooked to upper medium if not medium well territory which was a major disappointment.  To his credit, the server offered to get another steak after my unenthusiastic \"It's...okay\" response to his query.  The vegetable accompaniment left much to be desired: cauliflower and parsnips added little to the taste or visual appeal of the plate.  All in all, while the environment and service at Delmonico's are quite good, the quality of the food simply doesn't keep pace with the top area steakhouses.  I would easily put Delmonico's behind all my previously-reviewed Cleveland steakhouses:  Morton's, Red, Hyde Park, XO, Cabin Club, and Strip."}
{"text":"Overrated. I went to check the steak only and I got two - delmonico 16oz and  filet double-cut 10oz. Del was to dry and  filet wasn't tender, it wasn't like cutting the butter. Veggies - asparagus bitter and overgrown and Brussels sprouts over cooked. Good selection of wine. I guess the best was the hot bread, no olive oil though. Not planning to go there again."}
{"text":"I've been to Delmonico's a couple of times now for happy hour at the bar and I would compare the environment to more Pier W than Oak Barrel. Staff was on top of their game, I did not feel packed in like a sardine on a Friday night, and while the crowd did lean towards 50s+ the vibe seemed more professional and classy than a bunch of loud moms and dads having a drink before seeing a movie at Valley View.   Basically I felt comfortable there on my own just chilling in low lighting while enjoying happy hour food specials. One time I even engaged in some brief chatter with other ladies dining solo at the bar. Just a mature crowd in a good way.   Speaking of food: *Spinach Bake $6 - Not as thick and creamy as a dip you're probably used to, but still very good. I dumped the thin leftover sauce over my mashed potatoes.  *Little Christy $10.50 - Smaller version of their Christopher dish. You get one large asparagus, one shrimp, two cups of mashed potatoes (legit huge pile), and a 4oz steak. Really great deal, I was just disappointed that my medium rare meat was not juicy at all.  *Bowl Lobster Bisque $9 - I thought this was pretty good. I do like the lobster bisque at Zoup and Piada though so take my opinion as you will. Exceptionally nice to rip up pieces of the bread they give you and drop it in there to soak up the rich creamy goodness.  *Meatball Hoagie $7.50 - Ask for extra sauce because it comes out a little dry, but I really liked this. Get a side of pesto ranch to dip the homemade chips in and you're good to go.  *Pomegranate Smash Cocktail $4 - A bit strong for me.   They also have a daily flatbread, and while those typically aren't made with meat, they do look pretty good. The vegetable sides also sound appealing to me, but I'm not sure about paying $8 for some fancied-up steamed broccoli. They have a decent cheeseboard and a $3 beer if that is more your thing.   All in all, a good experience. Not a wowing raving good time and don't come in here with casual attire on, but I would go back for happy hour on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Fast service and very friendly staff. Liked the atmosphere, especially outside. Beer- very good. Food- okay. Fries were tasty and thick. Major kudos for the black bean burger, yum!! But...Salad was rotten."}
{"text":"First time here, came for my birthday, was amazing! The steak was melt in your mouth delicious, Creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus! The lobster bisque was creamy and amazing! Can't say enough about our service...Christopher was attentive, but gave us our private time too! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Delmonico's. The service was great, the food tasty and the pricing was reasonable compared to other steak houses.  They even offered sides with the meal, when so many of the steak houses offer everything  a la cart."}
{"text":"I've been to other Hospitality Restaurants and really liked them so my wife and I decided to try Delmonico. The calamari appetizer, bread and my wife's side of spaghetti were very good, beyond them everything else was mediocre at best. Our filets were tender but had no flavor, neither of us could taste the garlic in the garlic mashed potatoes. Even our pop was flat. When we informed the waiter about the pop he said \"we get a lot, it's a Pepsi\". What?!? So we just got tea. When I received my tea it had what looked to be the corner of a paper towel in it. The atmosphere is very nice looking but the dining area gets way too loud due to only a half wall dividing the bar and restaurant (the restaurant area is maybe twice the area of the bar).  We will not go back and I would not recommend this place. Go to one of the two other local steak houses, you will be much happier!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not a 5 star steak house.   Lots of positives and negatives. First, the service was incredibly slow. We were seated promptly but our server was extremely delayed with every visit to our table. Often times we would need something and she would walk right past our table. We ordered salads to start, which were good but took awhile. The main course took even longer, over an hour. My fiancé asked for his center cut filet to be cooked at medium temperature, it came out very rare. He ate it anyway because we didn't know how long it would take if he had it sent back. His mashed potatoes had good flavor but they were very dry. I ordered the center cut filet as well, at medium temperature, it came out perfect, and tasted wonderful. We both had moscow mules which were delicious. The manager stopped by our table very briefly, she had the personality of a mouthful of extra-dry beef jerky. This is a highly rated, higher-end establishment, I honestly expected alot better in all aspects.   There are way too many amazing steak houses in Northeast Ohio, I don't recommend this one. My fiancé enjoyed our experience overall but it wasn't amazing. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was very good but not over the top awesome like you might expect it to be based on the prices.  Our server Cathy, however, was fantastic and could hang with the pros at any Chicago steakhouse."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Demonico's for a date night.  I made a reservation for 5:30 on Saturday.  They open at 5 so it wasn't busy, but I definitely recommend making a reservation.  For my meal, I had the almond crusted walleye.  The lobster and butternut squash risotto that comes as a side was the best I've ever had.  My boyfriend had the 9oz. strip steak...he said it was \"pretty damn good\".  Our favorite part was the dessert.  We got the tiramisu it was AMAZING!  This restaurant is very nice for a date night!  The price is not bad either for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Spent over 300 dollars for dinner.  Ended up with some of the worst food poisoning I have ever had.  Had the T-bone steak and it was terrible but didn't know it would be contaminated as well.  Only thing I had eaten so I know it was this.  Awful and will never return."}
{"text":"Can we say \" Over rated\"? The decor is only nice in the bar area; the rest of the place is blah to include the painted drop down ceiling tiles that remind you of the grade school ceiling tiles. The appetizer platter: calamari was way over cooked and resembled a Michelin tire. The lobster bisque was all bisque; there was approximately a 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of \"lobster\" (that resembled somewhere between crumbs in the bottom of a potato chip bag no larger than a bacon bit) dropped into the top center of the bowl. The Delmonico (Steak) was 1/3-1/2 fat/grisel. This place probably had its day like Jimmy Dimora, (allegedly his favorite place) but like Jimmy Dimora that day has passed."}
{"text":"Great service. Great decor. Great place to go if you want to pay top dollar for a supermarket quality steak. I could've saved myself sixty bucks and just grilled a couple Ribeye's from Giant Eagle that would have had more taste than this DRECK."}
{"text":"Overall, good food. Steak was a little bland and shouldn't be as expensive as they charge. Mashed potatoes were very good. Service was excellent. Just would have expected better steak from a steak house"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but that's really the only thing good about this place. The famous lobster bisque was more like creamed tomato with lobster thrown in. It had none of the classic flavors of a good bisque and was way over-salted. The filet was charred, even though I ordered it med rare and the lobster was flat-not a puffy white. I suspect the lobster was frozen and then heated for the order. For the amount I paid for dinner, I was expecting an amazing meal. Very let down and I can't recommend."}
{"text":"This place had the best steak with a side of spinach with almond slivers and some cheesy polenta.  Service was fast and very courteous.  I made it back in time to see my evening news.  It is literally next to my hotel- La Quinta which made it more convenient.  By the way, the chocolate sauce with the steak was to die for.  This place is a bit pricey so keep that in mind when you come here."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim when we were in Cleveland for wedding it turned out to be a wonderful experience. It was a great meal In a time gone by atmosphere. Our service was wonderful the food was excellent.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a white table cloth experience with excellenceIn in a-relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Average at best. First off, our steaks were not cooked properly. The quality of meat could have been purchased at any other steakhouse for half the price. Secondly, do not waste your money on the crab cake appetizer. $14 dollars for 1 average sized crab cake. Nothing special & over priced."}
{"text":"Delmonico's is a very nice restaurant with excellent food. It is rather pricey but that's because it is very fancy inside, they have great service, and the food was very pleasing. We came here for a birthday with a large group of about 15 or so. Our waitress Anne was wonderful and was very attentive. We all had a nice experience and complimented the food.  I had the chicken marsala which was very delicious. The only change I would make to my food was to add a little more asparagus, there were only 2 pieces on my food and my uncle's, who ordered the same thing. My boyfriend had the surf and turf and loved it.  They have a large beverage selection and I enjoyed the Moscow Mule before our food arrived. Overall, a great spot for a special occasion. Be prepared that it is expensive but you are paying for the food and the overall experience. Our waitress Anne was kind enough to split all of our bills which saved a lot on time."}
{"text":"Nice romantic restaurant! The service was 1st class but it is $$$. The shrimp Cocktail was probably the best I've had in a long time- 4large, crisp shrimp with horseradish on top of the cocktail sauce. Friday's they have 1/2 price bottles of wine."}
{"text":"What a great dinner!  My wife and I had the pleasure of eating tonight at Delmonico's, my first time there.  Service was very good,  I had the 14 ounce Delmonico steak, and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  My wife had the 9 ounce strip steak with broccolini.  Very comparable to Hyde Park."}
{"text":"Took a friend and business contact here for dinner and some drinks. Overall this isn't the best steak I ever had but for the cost and what you get it I thought it was very good. Got fried calamari for an appetizer. Then, I got the \"classic\" surf and turf which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Creme brûlée for dessert.    Overall everything was very good but not great. But the bill wasn't a bank buster. $42 for decent steak and lobster with sides can't be had in a lot of places.  Overall an appetizer, two salads, two classics and two desserts and a bottle of wine was less than $200 (before tip).   What was great here was the service. Free valet.  They were ready for my reservation when I arrived 20 minutes early. The server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  She was attentive to our needs without being overbearing. The manager (I think) stopped by to make sure everything was good.  This is not the best steak house in the world but for the price and what you get I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Love coming here.  Predominantly spend my time in the bar and eating from the full menu.  Steaks are good.  Love the creative specials.  Can get things mixed and matched to create a perfect plate.  They had lamb lollipops that were to die for a couple weeks back.  I come for the wonderful service from Nancy and Corrine.  Stay because I always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"Love this Steakhouse! The Little Christy is amazing and I Love love the pomegranate smashes . I also love the shrimp and calamari. Happy hour is the best! Have nothing but great things to say about this place."}
{"text":"My Husband and I just enjoyed our Valentine's Day dinner at Delmonico's Steakhouse. It was definitely all that it is talked up to be! We enjoyed the Valentine's Day dinner for two and everything was wonderful! Our server was so attentive and accommodating. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Italian wedding soup with veal meatballs was delicious. I could have eaten a gallon.  I had the walnut crusted walleye with a vanilla sauce. Fish was dry and the sauce over powered everything else on the plate.  One coworker ordered Ceasar salad & got a plate full of yellow lettuce. Other coworker ordered sirloin that did not look appealing at all."}
{"text":"Solid but overpriced   Excellent bisque, So-so steak but 20-30% more money than it needed to be.   Steak Delmonico was $35+ and not that great!  I don't know about you but $35 steak is a pricey steak so I expect high things! It was big ... but flavor was just OK and more tough than I would like for the cut.    Wait team was well dressed but seemed to need one or two more training sessions.  They where training a new waitress and I can see why they have issues... the trainer cared less about my needs than she cared about the success of her trainee!  Skip it .."}
{"text":"If you would like to enjoy one of thee most delicious, classy, elegant Italian meals in Cleveland , this is the place. Fine wines, classic Italian dishes, lovely decor, what more would you want. Dates, family dinners, small gatherings, girlfriends at the bar- this is the place. A little on the high end of price range but worth. It."}
{"text":"Delmomicos is great,, went there last night for first time... All aspects of visit was flawless, reservation process, valet, excellent service, food and drink selection was great.  I had lobster bisque (could have the bee best ive had) and salmon and risotto entree. Salmon cooked perfect, medium rare. Lobster mashed potatoes on the side. Also very good. Server said everything in kitchen is made from scratch and i believe it.  Wife had the ribeye steak cooked medium and it was amazing as well. I will def return"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few days ago and was disappointed. I've gone her plenty of times for business meetings and it's normally pretty good. It seemed busy and like they were overwhelmed. First we were seated in a room close to the patio, which was nice because it was bright and sunny. On the flip side, the two of us were seated at this very awkward long table and couldn't have been further apart making conversation difficult.   The bread and butter was good and on par with other steak places. I ordered the steak Christopher medium well. The steak came out medium rare.I know it can happen, but it shouldn't happen at a restaurant that specializes in steak.  In addition when my server brought over my steak knife she noticed it was dirty and had to bring another.   Just meh this time around."}
{"text":"When I want a very filling and rich dinner this is the place to be!  Appetizer:  Appetizer plater includes calamari, mini crab cakes, Bocce balls-- all very delicious.  the Bocce balls were like a small pepper stuffed with cheese and fried (loved it).  Lobster Bisque:  very rich and flavorful; however it needs more lobster meat.  I could have also had a cup rather than a bowl... it was too filling.  Entree:  22 oz bone in ribeye steak with spaghetti and lobster mashed potatoes-- the steak was perfectly cooked to temperature.  the crust outside of the steak was smokey and full of flavor; simply outstanding.  the spaghetti was el dente, however the sauce was not the greatest, it was just ok.  Lobster mash.. awesome!  Dessert:  chipotle chocolate cake with salted carmel ice cream.  OMG this was the most amazing dessert I've had in a VERY long time.  the differences in flavor just meshed together so well.    I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When you travel for work, one finds that eatting alone is common place especially if you dont want to live on pizza and fast food. Tonight was the first time I have ever heard a negative comment about being a single dinner. If Im going to spend money in your restaurant then please keep your snotty comments to yourself. Now lets talk food. At one time I thought you could never have too much cheese but tonight I have prooven wrong. I orderd the onion soup and it had a cheese cap that was so thick that most of cheese did not melt. I ordered ribeye steak medium and it came out well well well done. When it finally came out correctly it tasted good but all I could think about was how in the world coud a steak house a place who specializes in steak over cook their meat."}
{"text":"I've always avoided this place because I think I had heard somewhere that it was cheesy and rundown...but in retrospect, I think I was confusing it with a different place in the same area.   I was very pleasantly surprised by how swanky and yet cozy the dining room was! The service was impeccable all night, and everything we had was delicious.   There was a small mix-up with my dinner (it got switched with someone else), and the manager made a point to stop by to check on us a couple times while it was being remade and even adjusted our bill for the trouble - totally unnecessary but appreciated! Great customer service!  Oh, and the food was seriously delicious. I love steakhouses, and this could be one of my favorites. My vegetarian-ish boyfriend found plenty of options and was happy with his meal too.  Remember to bring some cash! We felt bad about not having cash to tip the valet so we had to self park and walk down the hill like a couple hobos."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here last week. Good options for lunch that include soup, salad and an lunch portion entree. Service was professionally and a bit stuffy - probably due to all the clientele in suits.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Was told the meatballs were spicy. I didn't think so but, to be fair, this is Cleveland so \"spicy\" is relative.   Not sure I'll be running back here with all the good chefs in town."}
{"text":"It's named after a steak, so it has to be good!  I've been to Delmonicos three times so far (2 for business and 1 for a personal occasion) and it's been a positive experience each time.  As others have mentioned, it is a higher end establishment so try and look nice.  The bar area is relatively large and you can wine and dine there if you prefer.  I start out, go with, and finish with Ketel One on the rocks.  This place serves bleu cheese olives in bunches (three to be exact).    I've never had their namesake, the bone-in Delmonico, but another guest did.  It came out a little undercooked in parts and a little fatty, but that is almost expected with a bone-in steak.  I've had strip steaks and filet mignon and have been content.  Is there better steak houses in Cleveland? Probably a couple, but Delmonico's is probably the lesser expensive of the options.  The last visit (the personal one) didn't go as smoothly as the others (waiter underprepared and he under delivered, steaks weren't cooked exactly as requested) but I've been satisfied each time I was there.  They typically assign two waiters to a table as well."}
{"text":"Delmonico's is one of the best happy hours in the city. The Little Christy is a filet with bernaise, shrimp and asparagus for around $6 which is crazy. My office is within walking distance to Delmonico's so I come here from time to time. I took my mom out for her birthday lunch last year and it was a great midday celebration. Delmonico's is part of the Hospitality Restaurant group so there are definite similarities to the sister shops of Blue Point, Salmon Dave's etc... The steak oscar has been one of my favorite meals. The veal meatballs are some of the best I have had. They are a little on the spicy side so don't expect a bland ball of meat. The cheesecake has always been a great way to end the meal. Delmonico's is usually a pretty pricy endeavor. It is always better if the company is buying."}
{"text":"Nice place with great service and food.  Its the kind of restaurant where the servers are professional.  Let them do their job and you'll have a great experience.  I ordered sea scallops with a red pepper corn risotto.  It would cooked perfectly and tasted great.  I kinda wish I would have ordered something else though.  It was a summery dish and it had just began to get cold out.  This was my problem not theirs.  I would recommend it to anyone that's in the mood for a step up in their dinning experience.  Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Best food which I had in USA. I had a lobster bisque , scallop appetizer and and scallop and shrimp risotto. Highest quality"}
{"text":"We went two days in a row while visiting Independence, it was that good.  The steaks were perfect, lobster bisque was great, lobster was perfect... everything we tried was really delicious.  Our server, Toni, was wonderful.  I really enjoyed the Pinot Bianco too.  Thank you for the delicious food and excellent service.  We will be back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I just went to Delmonicos for Happy Hour. Just had surgery so couldn't drink. But the Happy Hour drinks, wine and beer were priced incredibly.  The Bartender/Server was the BEST!  I believe his name was Vince.  His service was impeccable.  He was friendly, efficient and not intrusive.  I was so impressed with him.  I eat out at least 20 times a week and I couldn't believe how great he was at his job.  Thank you very much.  You made my experience relaxing and enjoyable.  I ordered two items off the Bar Menu:  the 4oz filet (which was cooked perfectly) and the flatbread of the day.  I can't wait to return."}
