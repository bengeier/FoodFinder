{"text":"Best donut shop in the Pittsburgh area!! We moved to Pittsburgh from Illinois 2.5 years ago, and one of our favorite places we left behind was the best small business donut shop in northern Illinois. We haven't had a donut like theirs since moving here. We have tried the popular gourmet donut place here, but they just aren't your usual traditional donuts!! I had been waiting with great anticipation for Bob's to open their donut shop...and they did not disappoint! Please, please, please don't try to compete with the gourmet donut place and make super-funkadelic donuts like they have!! What you have now are seriously the best.donuts.around!!!! My husband plans to have his employer order donuts from Bob's for their weekly company morning meetings!!"}
{"text":"Raised donuts are fresh and amazing. Prices are very reasonable. This place is always packed but the line moves very quickly."}
{"text":"Efficient and super friendly staff! Very reasonable prices and the freshest donuts around!"}
{"text":"Very Good donuts at a fair price ! All kinds of fun off the wall flavors. Staff is well trained to take care of customers and all in uniform which is a great touch!"}
{"text":"What a great location for a new donut shop!!   Great selection of donuts too. It's a mix of all different types of specialty (bacon) donuts along with the basic favorites (glaze etc.). They offer sandwiches too for lunch.   1 dozen donuts $9.99 isn't too bad.  They were a hit at work!     The menu is pretty interesting... donut sandwiches are offered.  What I like the best about this shop is that they have a drive thru!!  The coffee is decent too..  but didn't knock my socks off. I love bold, dark/rich coffee. It tasted like a light-medium roast but was ok.   Ahh finally a drive through donut shop.. for those of us that are too lazy to get out of our cars in the morning!! I love having that option!  Located in the rear corner - rear area of Kenmar Plaza in Kennedy Township just across from Ricci's Sausage.  If you are not taking advantage of the drive thru.. there are parking spots located to the left side of the Donut Shop.   True fact: This shop opened mid January.  I thought it was going to open sooner .. was anxious for the opening. I called the shop on a whim mid January and was told they were opening soon. I remember driving by the shop in the beginning of January and they were still renovating and were \"not\" open for business.  I cant wait to go back and try a deli sandwich."}
{"text":"If your standard of a good donut starts with Dunkin, then you don't know anything about quality. Bob's Donut is ranked up there with the few great donut joints in Pittsburgh. I'm just glad they decided to open in Kennedy."}
{"text":"A Donut Shop that no longer sells donuts, interesting concept!?! Good luck with that one."}
{"text":"Amazing.  This would be the third time I've had Bob's Donuts and I just can't get enough.  The variety of cake & raised donuts is impressive.  They also have other savory options, bottled drinks, and coffee.  In all seriousness, there's not much to say here...these are the best donuts I've ever had-period."}
{"text":"I finally made it out to bobs donut shop with my husband,  I couldn't wait to try it, he took a dozen donuts to his work and I got a half dozen for home. Such a nice bright clean place the whole staff was so friendly and all worked together.  They seemed to be constantly busy which is a good thing, perfect spot for a donut shop there, just wish it was closer. The donuts are so good and fresh a nice selection I wish I would of took a picture of all those donuts. The coffee is good to. Definitely will be going back they have more than donuts!!!!"}
{"text":"Had some donuts here last week. Real good!  I wish there were more sandwich options and better coffee but the best donuts in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"There's a drive through (so convenient)!! And the cake donuts are amazing!!!!!  They are so tasty I just asked for a variety of a dozen and am positive all of them will be delicious.  They have so many varieties and I didn't realize they had lunch too.  This place is great!! And everyone is super nice too :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! Great variety. Loved the key lime and buttercream. Coffee is terrific too. Breakfast sandwich is soooo good but huge... could have split one between the two of us!  Great value for the price. And the service was awesome -- staff were all super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been waiting a long time for this place to open. We stopped there this morning and ordered Bob's big cinnamon bun ($3.50) and a cake donut with frosting ($.90). They were both delicious but we didn't realize the prices until on the way home I was reading the menu. We were charged $6.20. According to my calculator we should have been charged $4.71. Too bad we didn't check out the prices before we ordered. We will be going back but I surely am going to keep a close eye on the prices from now on."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of donuts, but because they are a locally owned business, I thought that I'd stop by.  I have to say that these are the very BEST donuts that I've ever had, especially the cake donuts.  The service is fast and friendly!  I stopped by for lunch too last Saturday, they had already run out of donuts but I wanted a sandwich, so it didn't matter. The sandwich would have been better if it were warm, but they are new and the staff was slammed, so I won't fault them for the mistake.  I will continue to go here for the occasional donut and a sandwich on weekends."}
{"text":"Up the hill, and tucked away in Kennedy Twp in the plaza behind the PNC bank is this lovely donut shop.....The choices range from classic cinnamon swirl donuts, to nostalgic apple fritters, to the popular bacon sprinkled maple glazed donuts....The counter staff was really friendly, and the donuts were fresh and tasty!....I'll definitely return the next time I have a craving  The shop has a drive-through, and they also serve breakfast sandwiches"}
{"text":"So I really am not a huge donut fan at all. If somebody brings donuts to work or wants to grab some from Dunkin or another donut shop, I actually have no issues passing it up. Well let me tell you, Bob's Donuts are PHENOMENAL.  First of all, the donuts were beautiful. There were so many kinds to choose from too. I had the \"cronut\" which is the croissant type donut. YUM. It was so fresh and flaky and perfect.  So after tasting that I had to sample more, against my diet.  I tried a bite of blueberry and the chocolate glazed as well.  They were all so fresh and delicious.    If you ever want to grab a donut or get a dozen to take somewhere, you must go to Bob's!!!"}
{"text":"This was a higher rating but a sign was up today stating they are no longer going to make donuts? Too bad, these were the best around..."}
{"text":"I loved Bob's Donuts from the first time I tried them. Great selection, friendly staff what more could I have asked for? I made it a ritual to stop by and grab a dozen every other Sunday. This morning I stopped by and learned some terrible news... Bob's has stopped serving donuts! They have decided to focus on a catering business and will still serve breakfast sandwiches only?!?! Frustrated to lose such a great donut shop."}
{"text":"When I was visiting my parents this past weekend I had mentioned to my mom that next time she visited me we'd have to go to this little donut shop down the street to which she replied \"we have one of those!\"  I had completely forgotten that Bob's Donuts was opening, so the next morning we took my toddlers down for a little AM treat.   First and foremost, I love their hours - especially the fact that they open early on Sunday's, too!  Huge win! Second, they have a drive thru - we went in, so I can't speak to the drive-thru itself, but great idea (and way to make excellent use of a former Jiffy Lube!).    Next, the customer service! We were indecisive, other than we wanted sprinkles (read: The kids wanted sprinkles), and despite a small line, the woman working the counter took a few minutes to explain their various cream filled options as well as special offerings.  I really appreciated it and she even gave my kids donut holes to munch on while we picked out our treats!    Last (and possibly most importantly) the donuts themselves-- We got a half dozen - sprinkles & fruity pebbles for the kids, cream filled, maple bacon, and red velvet for the adults. Loved the cream filled donut and the red velvet was delicious - the dollop of cream filling was the perfect combination of sweet and not tart, but not sweet?  The bacon donut was good, but not my cup of team.  The sprinkled donut was also quite good - fluffy and the icing was perfect, not drippy but not stiff.  The fruity pebbles donut was the \"worst\" of the bunch- to my adult taste buds the cereal was a bit stale, but the kids inhaled them.    All in all, I'll definitely be back when I visit my parents again - the donuts are fresh and the flavors are wonderful.  My only request?  Little signs!  I'd love if the donuts were labeled so I can see what each is before it's my turn to order!!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing donut spot. I have reviewed my fair share of donut spots in the city and while I don't believe it's the absolute best it is definitely worth the trip. The donuts are so cheap. I bought a half dozen for 4 dollars and these donuts were gigantic and delicious. Maple bacon? Don't mind if I do. Boston cream? Feels like they loaded it with pudding. Amazing place at a great price. Please, go."}
{"text":"We were out this way and wanted to try some different donuts. We googled and yelped and found ourselves at Bob's Donuts.   It was bright, clean and the employees were friendly. The variety was amazing, we had a hard time narrowing it down to a dozen. They had tons of fun toppings and seasonal options as well.   Ironically, we expected the cake to be better than the raised, but the raised surprised us and we're way better."}
{"text":"Bob's donuts has the best donuts I have ever tasted ! They are fresh, soft, fluffy and just delicious ! My daughters and I could eat them every day. The only down side, they are so good that you have to get there super early because they run out. I have stopped several times and the selection wasn't so great. The zig zags are our favorite. The people working are always friendly and fast."}
