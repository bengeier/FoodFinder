{"text":"Great for Friday night to hang out!! Great staff!! Good food!! No enough seats for guests!"}
{"text":"If you are only going to drink beer, then you are on the right track!!! The food is okay and the cocktails are horrible. It is a fun atmosphere to be on the patio that is up 3 floors though."}
{"text":"I think the Bob E. review might be a bit over the top rating wise.  Tommyfield is a nice place but the \"gastro\" side of things needs some work for sure. 

We tried the fish and chips as well as the chicken on a biscuit. The coleslaw which accompanied both was browning and really quite bad.  Average fish and chips at best.  

With regards to the chicken and a biscuit, there was a spoonful of sauce upon which was placed the biscuit, fried chicken and browning coleslaw. It was very dry overall and below average. 

The service was friendly and everything was clean.

I will likely return and give it another try but some menu items definitely need work."}
{"text":"First time here.   We reviewed the menu prior to our arrival which looked good.   We arrived at noon on a saturday to be given a limited brunch menu......aauugghh. no option to order off the regular menu. Very disappointing in that respect.   What we could order was very good.

BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU WANT LUNCH ON A SATURDAY OR A SUNDAY....COME AFTER 1 PM"}
{"text":"Oh dear. I am far from a picky eater, but the food at our first (and last) visit to \"Tommyfields\" last week was really poor. Why call it a \"Gastropub\"? 
I had the worst plateful of food, kind of disgusting fried chicken (how do you wreck that?!) and some gluey mashed potatoes. If they cooked it from scratch in the back, they should be ashamed. If they just thawed it out and cooked it, wow, where did they get it? And do they not ever try their own food there? 
My companion had a curry dish and, again, any frozen entree from Safeway is better.
The server was very nice, and deserved the tip, but I haven't had such a poor meal out in a long long time."}
{"text":"Not good. Expensive drinks. The fish and chips tasted worse than store bought and cost twice the price. That point alone was the most impressive fact about this place."}
{"text":"Upstairs patio.  Outdoor booths on rooftop patio have gas fireplaces.  Lots of TVs upstairs around indoor sports bar.  Good food and drink selection.  Very modern pub decor. Pub atmosphere.  Unique pub experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from Ireland and tried to have dinner with our 2 teenage children but apparently minors aren't welcome. I wasn't asking to serve them alcohol just food! The area could do with a decent family restaurant nearby!"}
{"text":"Service has been lackluster. 
Food is over priced for the portion.
Pint runs you the same as anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly servers and our lunch was mouth watering. The short rib sandwich is amazing!!! Highly recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times & really love the Seton 920 drink they serve. Great Atmosphere, great patio. Food has been hit and miss. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"atmosphere was nice though a little LOUD for a nice dinner. had to yell to speak with ppl at our table. service was great even for it being a busy Saturday night. big selection of beer if you're into that. personally I had the stampede queen House drink LOVED it :). food was pretty good I ordered fish and chips fish was great salad was fine but the coleslaw was nothing more than sliced cabage with horseradish. it was dry zero dressing and grose.  also they need a steak on the menu. one of our party had to order a steak sandwich without the bread to have steak. though they said it was one of the best steaks they had ever had. will go again hope they get a little bigger menu."}
{"text":"The main attraction for this pub is the rooftop patio. One Sunday afternoon we decided to take in some rays but still stay around \"home base\". 

The décor and layout is nicely done and has that brand new feel. We been twice in the last month or so and I have to say that the first time was much better than the second in regards to food and service.

First time around we arrived at 12pm and were told the brunch menu is only being served, regular starts at 1pm - it was very minimal but we made it work. We ordered a margarita pizza, mixed greens salad and wings. It wasn't bad, not amazing either - service was subpar but mimosas were on special and that was fun.

Second visit, we sat on the rooftop again which is still really nice and got to order off the regular menu. We had the short rib sandwich with poutine, tuna salad sans dressing and the calamari. Now, this time the poutine was pretty horrible - it was like ¼ cup of salt was sprinkled on before served, the calamari was far overcooked and many pieces were too hard to eat or tasted very fishy. There appeared to be cornmeal fried on which gave it a very unsavory texture as well. 

The tuna salad was good but boring; it lacked what normal tuna salads have (and I always get without dressing). I would say that the service was even worse this go around as well. 

All in all, I found the price did not justify our meals/service/experience and we may only go back again for a drink on the patio but not for the food."}
{"text":"Went here last night ordered the salmon over cooked, rude server!  Sent the salmon back ordered something else.  Took forever to get my meal husband was done eating still was charged for meal.  Gave me a 2.50 off my bill.  What a joke!  Won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitresses spent their entire time gossiping about who was making out with who rather than paying any attention to their customers. Do the owners even care about the service here?

Always great to hear which waitresses are looking for a guy who doesnt care if shes hooking up with other guys."}
{"text":"It's okay. Just a typical pub:lounge with nice decor. Food was average. Service was average. Nothing special during this visit. Burger was okay, chowder lacked fish but flavoured with fish."}
{"text":"Ive been coming into the Tommyfield for about three years now. Our usual server was Jill(?) everytime i came for lunch and the service was always amazing. This was one of the main reasons that kept us coming back.  The last several times ive been in ive had different servers and the total quality of my experience has decreased considerably. There no longer seems to be any consistency and none of the friendliness and professionalism that i came to expect and look forward to. With all the new pubs popping up in the area i will definitely be finding a new lunch location."}
{"text":"Wing night is awesome on the upstairs patio. However, the rest of the menu sounds great on paper but is poorly executed, no flavour and for a place that claims to be British pub... Not like any British pub I've ever been to. Also, they need a better drink menu. Who still only has Strongbow as their cider? It's 2016, widen your horizons. 

Almost everyone I've talked to that lives in Auburn Bay, Mahogany etc. Would rather go to 130th or High Street to eat dinner than go there.

In summary, needs a new menu and better drink selections."}
{"text":"First off, the restaurant itself is quite nice, interesting decor, comfortable seating. Not a lot of tv's so not the best for watching sports but a definite hangout place. 
The beer menu was good, featured some great local brews (very local - including tool shed brewing company from Mackenzie Lake).
The food menu was meh, not bad but nothing spectacular. The salad dressings are homemade and quite tasty but everything else was just okay. My husband had the fish and chips and we've had better in the area. 
Now on to what may prevent us from coming back. Our waitress (Brittany) was very rude. From the moment we walked in, she acted as if waiting on us was some big chore and not her job or anything. My pop was extremely flat. I asked our waitress if there was an issue with their pop and it was at that point she mentioned they have had problems with their co2. This information would have been super helpful when I was making my beverage decision. If she might have tried to be nice and pleasant she may have up sold me to an alcoholic beverage but instead she got her back up and asked what I expected her to do about the flat pop. True, what did I expect her to do, perhaps problem solve a solution so that her tip was not slim to non-existent.   Also I felt she was inappropriately dressed, I get that short skirts get tips but if I can see your bum, I don't want you near my food. 
Unfortunately, I don't think I will be back here because of the service, or maybe just avoid Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 2.5 star rating honestly. I expected more from this place based on the menu I saw online or maybe I set my expectations too high to start with. 

We went for my husbands birthday with a couple friends. I mentioned to the server it was his birthday and could they put a candle in his dessert, not much interest was shone by the server. 

Overall the table arrangement is poor, they do seat yourself so all the 2 person parties take up the large tables and then large parties are left with undesirable tables that are also way to close together. 

The menu has a lot of \"rotating\" items - like half the menu and half the beer menu... You would think oh it keeps it interesting but actually it's just annoying because it's like pulling teeth to get info from the server. 

Brings me to my next point - the service was terrible, she wasn't attentive and we were never even asked if we wanted a second drink or a water refill. 10% max tip service.

Food was however tasty, had the curry and the red velvet cake, which is why I am giving them \"2.5\" stars. 2.0 goes to the kitchen, the 0.5 is for the server and the venue setup to share."}
{"text":"Beef short ribs were quite good. The bartender was attentive. Overall they lived up to Gastro pub. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Love going for cheap wing Wednesday's! The maple soy wings are great, and I haven't had those anywhere else.

The Tommy-oh donut hole dessert is usually really good as well, although it's a ton of sugar! Don't go for it if your on a meal plan :)"}
{"text":"Less than a year ago I had written a review expressing my concerns with Tommy's shortly after it did a 180. The service was unmatched most servers knew us as we frequented so often. The food was always good and served within reasonable time. New management was brought on late March / early April and we are consistently disappointed. We've seen a turnover in servers and changes to the menu. It our tradition Sunday morning to come for mimosas Caesars wings and fried pickles. BUT they will no longer sell fried pickles with 'breakfast' although they will cook one fried pickles for their signature caesar. We have given it several changes since the changes but are coming less and less because it continues to disappoint. Shame on the new management made changes to an already working model."}
{"text":"Not sure what's happening here, but it's not meeting expectation tonight. It's wine Thursday and the place is almost empty! The crab was amazing but you still can't a decent American Chardonnay. Do not , ever , order the new baked Brie !! 


This was fun!! Well it was half price wine night after all. However we had the crab feature. 5 bucks !!?? The best half hour of eating you could imagine. Take your time, pick away, laugh at your friends and enjoy a bottle ( or 2) of halfhies!! ( wine) 

Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service in the city. Average pub food, nothing spectacular, and nothing overly \"gastro\" about it. 

Not worth the horrible service when there are so many other pubs near by."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch at 1:30 and sat at the bar. I sat...and sat.....and sat. 15 minutes and not a soul was interested. 
One other guy at the bar was face deep in his lunch and the place was fairly busy but no bartender or server was seen behind the bar or near it the whole time I sat there. 
Sorry- walked out went next door to Ricky's where they embraced me like a long lost family member and fed me well. 

Sorry Tommyfields, your places looked promising but I have waited for shorter periods of time at my dentist office."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as this is our only neighborhood pub (not including the Rickies all day grill next door or the fat burger that has a bar in it). The food is average pub food. Nothing spectacular but good enough that my fiancé and I keep coming back. Nice decor. Okay service considering how busy it always seems to be (again, this is the only neighborhood pub within walking distance of the south side of auburn bay). They were able to keep up when they were opened and filled to capacity at 5am for the men's gold medal Olympic hockey game (2014). Very loud on an average viist, which is fine,  but don't go here if you are wanting a quiet meal. I'm currently inquiring about gluten free/dairy free options and will update my review once a response is received (recently developing allergies). A con would be that their menu, while very simplistic, doesn't seem to make note of any gluten free or dairy free options. They seem to indicate vegetarian though."}
{"text":"I went there recommended by a friend and I would it was a very okay experience. I ordered a regular burger and added egg; I also ordered caesars dressing to deep my fries, but it wasn't good at all. 

Overall, okay for the south"}
{"text":"Guys, I am really disappointed. Normally I enjoy going over to have a pint at Tommyfield's, but tonight was really off -- it probably was because for the first time, Jason and I decided to sit upstairs. The patio was busy which is why it probably took quite a few minutes for the waitress to acknowledge us. She brought us our beers, but then didn't take our food order. We had to wait for her to come back.

 During my wait I noticed there was a dead bee on the light fixture above my head and a few other bugs that lost their little lives too soon which also wasn't awesome and my first thought was to wonder what the kitchen looked like. It's not like the fixture was 8 feet above my head, I used my hand to turn it to show Jason the poor deceased bee.

The food came from the food runner. Who failed to mention the dish was hot, but don't worry, my arm let me know when I reached across it to get my fork out of the condiment caddy. That sucks -- I am hoping this doesn't scar. We let the waitress know, but she shrugged it off with a \"sorry, we bake these dishes you know...\" Actually, I didn't -- the food runner didn't tell me.

Regardless, burns happen and heal, I used my beer and then my ice water to ice before finally asking the waitress to bring me an ice pack. And dinner was pretty good for pub fare.

We settled up and I went to use the washroom. Clearly there was a mark on me as the stall I chose didn't having a working hand dryer and was missing the ever important knob to open the lock. After a minute of claustrophobic panic, I MacGyvered my way out. My husband let the manager know (explicitly stating he didn't want anything, but wanted her to be aware and asked what happened to Tommyfield's), only to be replied with a shrug and a verbal agreement that she had no idea what was happening upstairs.

This is really too bad. I enjoyed brunch there and after work drinks. Counting down now for the Marriot hotel and hotel restaurant/bar to be finished."}
{"text":"Me and hubby had a wonderful date night at the roof top. Great ambience and a nice server.  The wings were ok but I really enjoyed my Lime Margarita."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night at Tommy Field. It was wing night lots of different flavours to choose from and they were good too. Server was a young spunky friendly girl that was able to tolerate our ribbing and joking as we discussed married life. Wings came out fast and hot. The had good drink specials. Lots of TV's to watch the game! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Staff: Friendly, and greeted us promptly. Our server delivered good service. Visiting from California and I know I'm in hockey country, but they were awesome to find my NBA team (playoffs) and put in on a few tv's. Good food and cool atmosphere. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and wasn't pleased at all for the dinner service. One time that sticks out the most was my birthday, we had a very rude server who was rarely seen and when we did eventually get our food half of us couldn't finish our plates as it was awful. 2 of my friends had to send their plates back. I ordered a pizza and most of it was burnt with barely any cheese. Their drinks aren't the greatest either. I will say that their brunch menu/drink are very good and a whole different service. I ordered the French Toast and it was incredible! I've been craving it ever since and would definitely go back for another brunch. Their mimosas were also very good."}
{"text":"The service was great - really engaging server. She would stop and chat and offer her suggestions. Really sweet girl. 
The food was ok. I had the chicken curry (it was a bit too salty for my liking), but I ate it! Not the worst thing I've had on my plate, that's for sure!
My cousin had the veggie panini and loved it. 
A little tip - wine is half priced on Thursdays and you can even get it by the glass at half price. We had a good Malbec for $3.15 a glass! Or split a bottle and its $13 a bottle. So that was kinda nice :)"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! The fried pickles were so good. Sad I didn't come here sooner (because I'm visiting from LA). Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Okay pub. Seating and atmosphere is great for comfort and chatting. Food was decent but not great. Good for a nice night out for drinks."}
{"text":"Good Place, Nice People, Good Food and Drinks.  I always stay near this part of town when I travel to Calgary and Tommyfield is one of the reasons.  Great place to meet friends or just watch a game and pass the time - either way, always a solid experience."}
{"text":"Never had such a rude server in my life. The amount of attitudes to everything she said was horrible doesn't make me want to go back. Also watching all the servers talk in the corner about different table is not appropriate. Management needs to seriously address this problem because the restaurant is beautiful, and the food is great."}
{"text":"In town for work. I love a good gastropub. This place was great. Had good specials, fresh food and a good vibe."}
{"text":"I have never wanted a restaurant/pub to be so good. Ever. 

What a disappointment. After 4 visits, I can say that I have not had a good meal in this establishment. The reason this is not a one star review is because the wings were decent (and let's be honest - wings are pretty important in a pub), and the beer has always been cold.

Simple things....like making sure the cheese is melted on nachos, and the fish and chips aren't cold. Don't think I'm asking for too much here.

I'll watch Yelp for awhile, and hope that the owners and managers of this place finally start concentrating on the quality of their food. So far, it looks like nobody really cares too much."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but the food doesn't qualify to a gastropub standard. Don't worry about presentation and more worry about good tasting food. I will defiantly return for the patio next summer."}
{"text":"The food, I had \"The Beef\" was bland and the portion was tiny. With four limp sticks of asparagus stuck with the mashed potatoes. Which seemed like instant potatoes. I sat at the bar since I needed something to do to kill time over lunch. My beer glass had a chip on it, but I couldn't tell the bartender because she almost never showed her face. Until it was time to collect the money, of course. In all, it was very underwhelming. I'd love to give it another try because the decor is nice, and they have a decent selection of craft beer. I just don't think they deserve my patronage."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding, beer is marginal, structure is really pretty cool and it's clean and inviting.  Nice place for a drink.  Food is not that great....ok, let me qualify.  Light eating is not easy.  I'm sure the food is very filling and satisfying for many.  But nothing stands out.  Fish tacos...fried.  How hard is it to grill?   

I like the concept, but to get to another level they need to reach out to another crowd.  Offer daring food that is not traditional.   

But, I've no doubt you'll enjoy your time here.  I do recommend"}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Tommyfield!  The atmosphere is lively, and the food never disappoints!  They also have live music on Saturday evenings!"}
{"text":"Late night menu, Sunday night, standard pub fare. Wings are hot and crispy, beer is cold, pretty much what I expected. Good deal on wings, and Caesars were in special. Just what I was looking for."}
