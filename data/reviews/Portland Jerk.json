{"text":"The best jerk chicken I have tried is here. Try there jerk chicken with the jerk sauce and their hot sauce poured all over your chicken if you like the spice. You will never go anywhere else believe me! There is one lady taller skinny and wears head scarf she is always smiling and pleasant to talk to. I must say though another lady who is heavier  set and slow walking kind of sends off a rude attitude to a lot of the customers. One time I walked right out when I saw the line up and that one particular lady at the front because I know she would take a long time and brush off the wrong way with the care free attitude.  I cant complain about the food. Although sometimes I feel like I'm being short changed on the meat when I get a large JC I expect no rice to show until I dig down for it!"}
{"text":"Being multiple times and likes jerk chicken and the goat curry. Rice is so so sweet as the beautiful girl suggested that they can severe half jerk chicken and goat curry. Loved the food. Keep smiling and serving the best food"}
{"text":"The best jerk pork around. I drive out of my way to have the jerk pork dinner with rice and peas covered in Ox tail gravy. The coleslaw and hot sauce are also second to none. It's a small place with limited seating in the front. Gary the owner is friendly and jokes around, having said that, the rest of the staff needs to learn from Gary what customer service is about. I find them unfriendly and unappreciative of my business. With the exception of the owner, the rest of the staff couldn't care less if you are in a hurry or are happy with your meal if they tried. I'd give it 4 stars but the service takes away the higher rating."}
{"text":"Best jerk pork I have ever tasted. Also a rarity because jerk pork is almost never a menu item at most places. Good sized portion too. Pricing is moderate."}
{"text":"Alright so what makes this place nice?  Start off with the vibe.  Small Caribbean joint the owner has a strong accent and is really nice.   I got the small jerk pork. Now usually these joints give small portions. But not Portland Jerk! GENEROUS portions even for this small.  Also another cool option is they ask what type of gravy to put on. OX TAIL GRAVY is the way to go.   Overall great food, good price.   PS small joint so you probably should order out."}
{"text":"I'm come here on Tuesdays for their $5 Jerk chicken lunch special. The \"small\" portion they serve that day is very generous for the price. All in all great chicken portion size no matter what day you visit."}
{"text":"Great food good prices. Not a large eat in area but good for quick lunch. Amazing jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for many years now and consistently buy the jerk pork with oxtail sauce. Consistent and delicious every time.  Jerk chicken is my back up meal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to add a review about Portland Jerk for a while. My opinion - this is the best Jamaican restaurant (take out) in Brampton. I usually get a variety of different dishes, from oxtail to curry goat to jerk chicken and more, and I am never disappointed. Food is always flavourful with the right amount of spice. The meat is tender. I wish I had pictures to show you. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Brampton area. Check it out and I hope you enjoy it.   Note- this is more of a take out place. They don't have too many seats (2-3) for sit down."}
{"text":"Very yummy, flavourful everything! We came by to get take out, we got the jerk chicken, jerk pork, ox tail and a curry chicken roti. The meats weren't dried out, nicely marinated/seasoned and the rice is super yummy! They do not cheap out on the portions (more rice than meat)!  Only thing - not spicy enough but then again, I have an obsession with spicy food. I would definitely recommend this place. Too bad they're so far from me!"}
{"text":"I've been to Portland Jerk many times before but for the 1st time I tried the oxtail w/ rice and peas. There are only a few seats by the door so it is mainly take-out only. I dropped in for lunch with my girlfriend and she had our usual stew chicken.   I was excited to say the least since I love meat(s) closer to the bone (i.e. ribs) because there is more flavor imo. I was very satisfied with my 1st bite. The gravy was just fantastic and the meat was soft and mouth watering. Not exactly fall off the bone but very tender. What can I say? I'm a fan! The rice is not bad if you make sure most of it is covered in the ox tail gravy (I love sauce). The dinner comes with coleslaw, which is decent. It is a little watery towards the end but it is a lot better than some of the sour coleslaw's that I have had in the past. It wasn't too creamy either so it's not overwhelming. Back to the oxtail! Haha I can't say much more than to try it if you're in that neck of the woods. If you don't like oxtail the jerk chicken or stew chicken is also delicious. Sometimes the jerk is spicy so it gives it that extra little kick that you might like :)   **If you have any suggestions for other places to have Caribbean food PLEASE don't hesitate to let me know!**"}
{"text":"I was craving oxtail and decided to stop by based on the reviews. It was busy but service was quick and friendly. The oxtail was good, could have been cooked a bit longer for my taste and I didn't care for the added sweet taste to the meat but it paired well with rice and coleslaw and was tasty. Not sure if I would order again but I've had their jerk chicken in the past and it was great."}
{"text":"Dayyyyyyummmmmmmmmm! Went on a discovery day in Brampton and had Caribbean food on my mind, more specifically Jamaican eats. Not patties, not jerk Chicken but some wholesome Rice and pease slathered in Oxtail sauce and a massive pile of pork all over it.  I'm not jerking you around either.... but Portland Jerk just might be.  They've been jerkin' it in the same semi-run down plaza for 20 years, but when you're having a good jerk you really don't care where you are or who you're with, all is good in the world.  The staff here were so happy to find out it was our first time, and they proudly boasted about their menu and how long they've been here and how people keep coming back. They really didn't need to sell me, I was there to eat and nothing was gonna stop me.  I went with a small because we had other food stops to make and  hoe-leeeeee-guyyyyyy, that small could have fed 2 people no problem mon. Legit, I don't know who the large is for but when the small is packed with just rice and peas to the brim of the container and THEN they add the same portion size of charred, succulent, juicy pork on top... well don't make any plans for your afternoon except chillin'  Even now I'm droolin as I relive my experience. Amazing? Definitely. Best ever? Likely. Will I be back - already doing so next Tuesday with friends.  Eatcrest Out  PS - most of the dishes come in large and small sizes, EXCEPT for Oxtail, Large only so come hungry boi!"}
{"text":"They were out of jerk chicken twice, but I finally got my hands on them for lunch. Good food and service."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken with drizzle of oxtail sauce! it was yummy! they're very friendly with the portion .. I only ate half and I was full! the other half will be my breakfast for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I don't mind being a \"jerk\" if it means I'll be eating this delicious food every day. This restaurant is located at the corner of Torbram and Queen, inside a plaza.   I decided to come here based on the reviews with co-workers. Small store with only counter seating available. It looks like takeouts is the popular option. This is what we did. You place your order first and then you pay. Prices are reasonable and food comes out fairly quick.   I ordered the large Jerk Pork. It comes with rice and a very tiny container of coleslaw. I did not ask for any jerk sauce or oxtail sauce but I should have. Even without the sauce, the pork was tender and moist. The rice is okay but the coleslaw is better. Too bad that they don't give you more. My co-workers ordered the Pork and Chicken Rotis. The Chicken is boneless. It does not come with Potatoes. They were good but the Jerk is better. I want to order the Jerk Chicken next time.   The rating is closer to 4.5* based on the food alone. Not ideal to eat in knocks half of star down.   Highly Recommended!  #11 of 2018"}
{"text":"I go here with my co-workers on a weekly basis. We love the jerk chicken. Very tender, and the rice is really good as well. Rice comes with the chickpeas, and we usually ask to get some sauce on the rice. The chicken is full of taste. The consistency of the sauce is not always the same... sometimes they make it a bit too spicy (for my co-workers). I enjoy it spicy anyways, so for me that's usually a bonus. Definitely would recommend. On Tuesdays they have the 5$ special, which in my opinion is a very large portion. I usually get the small plate."}
{"text":"Edit: made this a 5 star review. Why didn't I in the first place? Proceed to original review...  Some friends said this place is known for their jerk pork. Finally made it over and ordered the small portion with rice and peas. When I received the box, it felt a comparable weight to a newborn baby. Came back to the office and it completely filled a large plate - and it wasn't 90% rice either, there was a lot of pork.  The pork was very tender and well seasoned and even a unique taste. There were a couple fatty parts, but that's the cost of having tender meat and if that's not your thing, but be sure to have a knife. Rice and peas met the standard and wasn't clumpy - so it was fresh.  Very solid dish and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious Jerk chicken! I came here because of the great reviews as usual and it did not disappoint! I got a pound of Jerk Chicken and my brother got a large Jerk chicken meal. The total was $20 which is a great price for the Portions that you recieve here.  The smell of the Jerk sauce is still marinating my car and I wish it could stay there forever. The jerk chicken tasted wonderful and it was not too spicy which I prefer but just sweet enough to add a little flavor boost.   I will definitely be coming back here for my Jer Chicken fix and try the Jerk Pork and Oxtail next time!"}
{"text":"Most tender jerk pork I've had. Finished my meal before realizing I wanted to take a picture of it. It'll sure I'll remember the next time I go there which will be soon."}
{"text":"My favourite is the jerk chicken, I get it every time go. However, the last three times I went there was no jerk chicken left which makes sense because it's so good. This place is usually packed every time I go, but it's worth the wait for the jerk chicken and jerk pork. I've also tried their curry goat, but it wasn't that good. The food also isn't that spicy if your looking for something with a bit of kick. If the jerk chicken was spicy i'd give this restaurant 5 stars, but nonetheless it's worth going and trying a few of their dishes."}
{"text":"For all you Jamaican food lovers we all know how hard it is to find jerk pork these days.  Well I finally found a place really close to where I live.  Very tasty, super fresh.  I have only been here once so all I have tried was the pork and the rice and peas.  I will be visiting this place in the future and will add to this review and also add pictures."}
{"text":"One of the best jerk restaurants I've been to in the GTA!  Portland Jerk is consistently good."}
{"text":"The oxtail is good this is the only thing I tried here they done give you coleslaw like other places.  I would go back the prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Got take out jerk chicken and did not disappoint. Perfect amount of spice and sweet, juicy and tender chicken. This place is a bang for your buck.  Big portions to satisfy big eaters."}
{"text":"This review can't describe how amazing their Jerk Chicken is!! I've been around the world, been to almost every Jamacian Restaurant in Brampton, been to the number 1 rated spot in New York for Jerk Chicken but nothing compares to Portland!! My friend tried their Jerk Pork & said it was the best thing he has ever had"}
{"text":"Very nice jerk chicken. Absolutely love it. I have tried other places for jerk but this by far is the best of the best."}
{"text":"Best jerk I've had.   I often come here for the jerk pork. It's the best jerk pork I've ever had. for $7.50 (+HST), you get a half sized container absolutely packed to the brim with jerk pork and rice and peas. They also give you a small container of coleslaw that I like to mix into the rice when I eat.   The jerk flavour at Portland Jerk is unlike a lot of other places where the focus is on the heat - at Portland, the focus is on the flavour.   That's pretty much all I've really tried at Portland Jerk, really. Most of the time I like to try different dishes from the menu, but at Portland I just keep getting the pork.  They also have a jerk chicken lunch special on Tuesdays where you get a large container for $5 (+HST). I've had it once and it's also quite good. I'm sure you can't go wrong with most of the stuff on the menu so don't be afraid to try other stuff out.  PS. The guy at the cashier is also ridiculously good at throwing unwanted receipts into trash cans, so watch out for that."}
{"text":"The Resto is quite deceiving from its exterior. The interior has such a warm welcoming feel to it. Pictures of Lennox Lewis to artwork bring such a homely vibe to this place. What can I say.   I love jerk.  I have been on a search for the best jerk in the GTA for a long time. Portland Jerk definitely has some tasty food. My order consisted of a a Large Pork, Ox Tail and a half pound of Chicken. Everything Was delicious. Not over spicy but tasty.  One hour before closing I arrive.  No line ups.  Was greeted by two lovely ladies.  Within 5 minutes I was on my way back home with a bag full of food. The only downfall to my visit was that the Resto ran out of coleslaw.  I managed to get one container of the slaw but was quite the disappointed when no offers of free pop or water came my way.  My wife informed me that the slaw was yum. Raisins - oh ya!! I wasn't allowed to try it.  Lol. Now you have to know that it took me 40 minutes from my house to the restaurant.  Dayaam. I toughed it out because all the great reviews. Kudos to Sam, John and Jon.  Hey,,, if you have the time and are willing to take the time to trek out to east Brampton, do it.  Yummy food and pleasant atmosphere.  Peace my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"I have been going here for decades    Quality is always consistent. I love the jerk pork and the curry goat. And the coleslaw is delicious.  Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Best days to go are on Tuesdays for the special. Lots of parking No seats to sit and eat"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Large portion sizes and very tasty.   More recently, the meat portion sizes have been getting more bland and smaller and smaller. You get more rice than anything else, whereas before they would pile on meat and I wouldn't be able to finish it, now i'm just left with a ton of rice.   Also, aside from the one gentleman (I believe the owner) the staff are fairly unfriendly and don't understand that most of their customers are on lunch from work. Speed of service is casual and don't expect things to run smoothly if you're on break from work. I also know that they often give preferential treatment to certain customers and don't give equal portion sizes and deals to all customers.   Those gripes aside, it's okay. The food is decent and I don't think you can find a better jerk pork in brampton.. that being said.. I hope they step up and go back to the food they used to provide with some service that is decent.   I used to eat here probably once a week because it was so close to work.. and now it's once every four weeks.. I went today and I was hoping that I might get surprised.. but no, it spurred me to right this review..  Hope they take note."}
{"text":"Portland Jerk has THE best oxtail and jerk pork I have ever tried in my LIFE!  I always joke to my friends that if I were famous and out of the country, I would have Portland Jerk flown to me.  That's how much I need it in my life lol.  I've been coming here since high school and I am now 27.  I'll never stop coming here.  I've tried MANY Caribbean places in search of something on par or even better than Portland and I just cannot find one. The oxtail is more than fall of the bone.  It's like melt of the bone. Paired with the rice and peas.  Omg, heaven.  Their jerk pork is just as tender and cut into perfect bite size pieces.  I also have yet to find a Caribbean spot that is up to par with Portland's jerk pork. Don't forget to get oxtail gravy on your jerk pork!  Can't have it any other way!  They are not stingy on your meat or rice.  A meal usually lasts me a lunch and dinner lol.  Seriously. you don't know oxtail (or jerk pork) until you've come here.  Try it!!"}
{"text":"I go here 'cause it's close to me. Most of the servers are hit or miss attitude-wise, especially when it's busy. One time it was -7 outside, they put my order in a brown paper bag. I kindly asked the lady (who shall remain nameless) to put it in a plastic bag instead (like they're supposed to) so it's easier to carry to avoid frostbite and even the Lord above felt that ratchet piece of cut-eye that ensued! Apart from that, they're curry goat and oxtail is mouth-watering and tasty. Good portion sizes too."}
{"text":"Ok try the beef soup way too much potato I rather more soup than food any way taste is standard not bad .got a mix of curry goat and oxtail rice not bad oxtail ok a lil sweet curry goat taste good way too much bone . I would try again next time jerk pork on my list . Service wise it's ok . I don't care Wat kinda day ur having smile with good service that's how u get me to come back"}
{"text":"I grew up in Mississauga but never really made my way to Brampton to eat. I was invited out to Brampton for a discovery day of eating and on the recommendation of a blogger pal, was told that Portland Jerk was the place to go.   The place is located in a dirty little strip mall that you wouldn't think much of. The location is small, with a take-out counter and seating for maybe 8 people total. We arrived around 11:40 am and the place was empty. At 12 pm on the dot, the place had a line-up almost out the door.   The owners take pride in all their dishes and have been in business for 20 years. The small jerk pork I ordered (which seriously could have fed two people for $6.75) comes served up with rice and peas and creamy coleslaw. My advice: get your jerk pork drizzled in oxtail sauce. You will not be disappointed.   Since my visit, I have recommended this place to at least half a dozen people and now I'm recommending it to you, Yelpers. Get your butts out to Portland Jerk. It's worth the trek out to Brampton."}
{"text":"The food here was good for my first experience with jerk spice. The people who run the place are very ignorant when asked where the rest of my meal was. We were told we don't have any and we are not making it for you.  Kind of like I already have your money.  What do you want me to do.  She just walked away.  Never will I eat here again."}
{"text":"I must say that a 5 star rating does not do justice to this place. Their jerk pork is the best!! I highly recommend their food."}
{"text":"Came here on the Thursday of Jan 25, 2018. Ordered the oxtail on rice with coleslaw. Ended up with food poisoning or stomach virus few hours after eating this and was bed ridden for 2 days. Can anyone confirm they got sick from the food on that day? Would like to know if this place was the cause which i cant see why it wouldn't be the culprit."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 if I could. Very true to the other posters, the taste is killer. Ordered the much hyped jerk pork with oxtail sauce. The small portion itself is huge. Came out sizzling hot and fresh tasting. The charred yet succulent tender pieces with the carrib rice was really cool."}
{"text":"Portland Jerk is amongst one of the best jerk places in B-Town, it only really comes down to two places either Gem's or Portland. Portland's Jerk first off is not as spicy as Gem's sometimes Gem's can be overly spicy on one piece. The chicken itself is tender and almost falls off the bone and you can taste the jerk seasoning right to the bone! Their ox tail is equally as good as Gem's and they have a combo where you can get a large ox tail + jerk chicken only $11!  (compared to Gem's $18~ although the size of Gem's portions are definitely larger). Portland is definitely worth a try and definitely one of the best of Brampton's jerk chicken scene."}
