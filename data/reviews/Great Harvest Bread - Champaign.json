{"text":"Like their freshly baked goods. Bought a almond vanilla swirl. Not cheap but taste good."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST EVER!!! I no longer live in the area and I miss Great Harvest EVERY DAY .... Lisa the owner is the best and the crew she has working there is awesome.  I went there from the first day it opened till I moved last year ... there is no better place to go for great bread... great  sandwiches and salads ... great cookies and treats.... you can buy coffee and take it home soup mixes, jellies, sauces, she has it all.  I use to go every day and get my cup of coffee then buy one of the many choices of FRESH bread...my families favorite is the cinnamon chip... it makes excellent french toast  and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I hope you can visit soon and often you won't be disappointed.  It is truly one of a kind place."}
{"text":"My first time coming in and I was blown away by the friendliness of the staff! Ended up buying an extra loaf of bread because it looked (and smelled) so delicious. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"love love love this place. doesn't quite live up to my favorite great harvest in my hometown, but still the staff are nice and the bread is always good. favorites are the honey whole wheat, the cheddar garlic, and anything apple. and the scones. i love the scones. they aren't your typical scone (they're basically the size of my head!) but they sure are yummy. also love the make-your-own sandwich option. any sandwich on my favorite honey whole wheat (been eating it since i was 11) is heaven. 
also good to know about their free slices of bread, which you have to lather up with their butter. yum."}
{"text":"how can i not love a place that supports local running?!  these guys are at just about every road and trail race i've run in the last 5 years, and i appreciate their support....

even with that bit of business, i stinkin' love this place.  they have a lot of different breads from sweet to savory to sandwich, and i adore their multi-grain breads.  they have a carb aware bread that is made with tofu to amp up protein and lower carbs.  it's great stuff.  

it's not open on mondays, which i sometimes forget, but if there is someone there -- they usually let you in and will sell you whatever bread they have in stock.  they are always super friendly, and one of the only places i can find challah during the holidays."}
{"text":"Another artsy-fartsy purveyor of \"artisan\" products.  There are some good items to enjoy, like some of the breads, but when I pay such a high price for a loaf, it had better be awesome or at least toast and butter itself for me.  These loaves are  neither.  Again, there are some good loaves of bread here and you could make the rounds of the various kinds and find one(s) that fit your palate.  Their much hyped cinnamon rolls disappointed.  The outer layers were dry.  How dry?  When I dipped a strip into my coffee, it sucked up the entire cupful.  Okay, that's an exaggeration, but the outer layers were very dry.  The inner curls were quite good, if a tad too sweet, but nothing any more remarkable than Panera or Atlanta Bread Co versions.  I bake bread and cinnamon rolls and other fare that Great Harvest sells, so I appreciate the work put in and the delicate neature of the process.  I applaud places like this and Mirabelle snd Pekara for their quality and variety and frequent successes.  And for making real bread.  When it is said that a culture has bread as its food staple, this is the kind of bread of which they speak, not the mushy white Wonder bread."}
{"text":"I dropped in to grab a quick sandwich and while it was not so quick it was really good,  I ordered the basic ham and that's what it is.  A basic ham cheese lettuce and tomato sandwich but for some reason it was better than most places.  The flavor of the ham was really good and everything was fresh and crisp.  The bread was a little stiff but that didn't bother me.

They offer you slices of bread to try.  I chose some cinnamon bread that was very good.  They have jelly's, spread, breads, sandwiches, salads and soups.  Not a huge variety of sandwiches, salads and soups but sometimes that is a good thing."}
{"text":"I had only ever tried Great Harvest's products at the Urbana farmer's market, and I really enjoyed finally getting a chance to visit the store. The staff were super friendly, and were quick to offer my girlfriend and me a slice of one of their breads, topped with their butter or jam if we wanted. They have a really great selection of breads, rolls, scones, muffins, and sandwiches, and I'm definitely looking forward to trying more!

Very few of the products in the store (soup mixes, jams, honey, etc.) are locally made, but I didn't even realize they were a chain of stores until after I visited. Either way, they have a nice selection, and I'll absolutely be going there again."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was just looking for a place to have a nice sandwich and was pleasantly surprised to learn when I got there it is not a sandwich shop! It's a bakery that makes some sandwiches. They have homemade jams and nut butters, fresh bread daily. The offer samples of their bread while you take a look around. I got their turkey sandwich, which was nothing special but still good. But I did buy a loaf of the cinnamon chip bread and it is to die for. It's wonderful and fresh. I will be going back there often to buy my bread from now on. The staff was friendly and really helpful too."}
{"text":"The great thing about Great Harvest is that, while a national chain, they make a point of maintaining the \"mom & pop\" feel of the store.  I was shocked to spot one in Southern California (where I now live) after years of stocking up at this Champaign location... I had always assumed they were a local business.

Bread here is sinful.  There is no \"healthy side of the menu,\" they're just varying degrees of \"pur your diet on hold.\"  I would love to see some sprouted and gluten-free options.  That said, I've yet to try a loaf, cookie or muffin that wasn't completely delicious."}
{"text":"I love this bakery -- it's my favorite in the CU area, and that's saying something. The bread, cookies, bars, dessert loaves, etc. are all incredibly good and good every time: moist, flavorful, fresh, well seasoned, and wholesome. The bread is substantial with a well developed crumb -- not airy or light -- and that's the kind I like. 

The occasional specialty breads are to die for. I once took a loaf of the monkey bread to work, and it was mobbed. People from the office made a beeline to Great Harvest to buy more to take home. Some of the savory items are just as good -- the pepperoni rolls in white and the heavenly veggie rolls in wheat (although they aren't available as often). They now offer sandwiches to go, but I haven't yet tried one.

But it's the day in, day out everyday loaves that make Great Harvest such a great bakery. Their whole wheat breads are especially superior -- chewy and richly flavored. Their white breads and challah are good, too. If the bread is seeded or includes something like nuts or berries, you can be sure there are plenty worked through or across the dough, too. And they will slice just about anything, unless it's a very odd shape.

I've even tried their carb control bread. I won't say it is a good diet choice, because you won't be able to stop eating it. It's denser and less tasty than the regular items, but much better than the other low carb breads you'll find, even in specialty stores. Great Harvest also offers a brochure about making diet choices, for those with diabetic or other dietary restrictions.

When you enter the bakery, you'll be offered a slice of bread, buttered and with jam if you want, as a sample. You'll also find some nice gourmet foodstuffs and kitchen items that go with the bakery theme. 

Great Harvest Bread Company is one of our local treasures. Nothing at Great Harvest tastes like it comes from a franchised bakery, and in fact, owners of each shop are allowed (and often do) alter recipes and offer their own to suit local tastes and use local ingredients. 

I can't recommend this bakery enough!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bread in town!  I love the honey wheat bread, the rolls and buns, scones, sweet breads, and muffins at Great Harvest.  They have consistently good food at reasonable prices.  The Irish soda bread they make (only certain times) is a special favorite.  I only wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"When I was little, I loved when we got bread from Great Harvest.  Unfortunately, the one back in my suburb closed years and years ago, so I went without for far too long.  Then I came to school at UIUC, where I discovered, to my joy, Great Harvest still existed!

They bake different breads every day of the week, so if there's something in particular you want, it's best to plan ahead.  But really, no matter when you go, you won't be disappointed.  Their breads are all heavy and thick.  I do enjoy getting a loaf of sourdough from grocery store bakeries, but it's nice to get something that's actually more bread than air.  The honey whole wheat is perfect toasted, and their apple breads are amazing.  I remember really liking the mufffins and one of their cranberry breads when I was little.  I haven't tried them in recent years, but I have no doubts they'd be just as good as I remember.

Remember to stop in early, especially on Sunday, so the breads you want aren't sold out!  You can also call ahead orders so you won't miss out."}
{"text":"I got a Challah bread from Great Harvest and made it into a ricotta lemon zest bruschetta, which turned out very  nicely. I brought it to a summer party. Everyone liked it!"}
{"text":"I had gone for breakfast at a nearby restaurant which had a wait time of 30 minutes. Hence, to kill time I went to the bakery. It's a cute little bakery. Staff is really friendly. They have a good variety of spreads and fruit butter, other than bread. I bought spinach biscuits, focaccia and a chocolate chip &a walnut cookie. Everything tasted good and fresh. Spinach biscuit was my favorite among all."}
