{"text":"Quick service and great sandwich's. I prefer this place to potbelly's or jimmy johns because the ingredients are better and the service is faster. The bread is great and they've provided a lot of meat on my sandwich every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Freshest subs and wraps in Cleveland! There's no way I could even begin to describe how fresh. Veggies are always perfect, along with everything else. Fast and amazing service. My favorite sub place downtown, so happy they opened up."}
{"text":"I got the Philadelphia cheese steak sub and was Greatly disappointed the bread was crumbling and tasted stale the amount of steak well I have had more steak on a sandwich from subway. The peppers and onions are not freshly done and very little on it I will not go back as they are overpriced well."}
