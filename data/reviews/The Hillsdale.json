{"text":"Looks like they are making changes. New chef and good food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is the burger pub formerly known as Bamburger, and I used to really enjoy it here.  But after our experience last night, the nicest thing I can say about this place is the staff are super friendly. Oh yeah, and the fries and gravy are pretty good I guess.  But the burgers are no longer Bamburger quality, not even close. Ours were horribly dry and the buns tasted stale. We didn't enjoy the meal at all. Also, they changed their menu and now they charge 50 cents for regular mayonnaise. Huh?! They also removed onion rings as a burger topping (my fave) and they no longer have brie as a cheese option. As for our side salads, they were limp.  Oh Hillsdale, why did you mess with a good thing?  With so many great burger options in hogtown, we won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of good places to grab a drink near Yonge and Eglington so we tried Hillsdale out.  It is clean and self-evidently new but lacks in atmosphere.  This might be because it was so empty but generally I just didn't connect with it.  It has a chain feel.  The nachos and wings are half price when you order beer from 5-7.  The nachos are OK, I didn't have the wings but the verdict on then from others was the same."}
