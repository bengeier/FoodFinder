{"text":"Went here for the first time last Friday. Sat on the rooftop patio, which is quite large. Food was good, but nothing that made me go \"Wow\", that could be because a smaller menu is offered on the patio. Great wine selection though, and our server was really good. Had a drink in the main restaurant  at the bar before leaving. Nicely decorated, be a nice place for a date. ( I was with a girlfriend) I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday last night. It's unfortunate that some reviews online had me questioning whether we should go here at all, but thankfully my husband said he wanted to try it out given that it was so close to home.

This is the sweetest little restaurant. Very cozy, and filled to the brim with French posters from art galleries, etc. Loved the black and white tiled flooring & everything else about it was charming. If you are a fan of privacy I'd recommend making a reservation and asking for a secluded table as there were a few scattered around the restaurant. Otherwise the tables are placed rather close together. We came early enough so it wasn't too busy, and what I did like was that they spaced people out around the restaurant so that you weren't seated next to anyone until they absolutely had to.

Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful regarding what to order! 

For the wine we shared a cheap half litre of Merlot. The one thing that always gets me at restaurants is how much the wine is marked up. Their Cabernet special of the day was $30 for a half litre. While it was delicious (we tried it before we made up our minds) I'm glad we didn't end up ordering it as a quick Google search told me one bottle went for $14. This isn't specific to this one restaurant as all restaurants do this but if you're not looking to be wowed by your wine, the cheapest option usually does the trick ;)

For the appetizer we split the onion tart and the escargot. The onion tart was creamy, melt in your mouth heaven. The escargot wasn't the best I've had and the puff pastry was a bit soggy at the bottom but I do tend to enjoy it more when drowned in butter and garlic. Next time I will ask if this is an option, if not I think I would pass on the escargot. For dinner we got the Trio of Sausages & the Lamb Loin (ordered medium). We loved the sausages paired with the dijon mustard (which was a whipped delight!), each one had its own flavour and for two meat lovers you can't really get any better than a plate of sausages. The lamb was one of the BEST I've had! Cooked to perfection it was very tender and melted in my mouth. Each dish is paired with a nice serving of veggies and we were both stuffed to the brim once we finished our meals. For dessert we shared the chocolate mousse which was delectable, I wanted to lick the bowl clean. It did have orange zest in it though which you could taste, so if you're not a fan of orange-y chocolate I'd pass on this one. 

Price-wise this place is a steal. You get a lot of food and for $122 we had a 1/2 litre of wine, two appetizers, two main courses and shared a dessert. Definitely worth checking out! We will return."}
{"text":"I was super pumped to try this restaurant and overall it was nothing special. The selection was slim, the staff seemed very junior and the food was ok, but definitely not worth the $$$."}
{"text":"Merlot is a great restaurant that, while a bit formal, has a number of rustic French dishes. They're known for their pommes frites, which have a lightness you don't usually get in plain old french fries. Perhaps they use better oil for frying.

The rooftop patio has full service, but a slightly different, and less expensive menu and more casual atmosphere. The calamari (whole squid on a bed of greens and vinaigrette) makes a good appetizer, and there are a number of entrée-sized salads. Of course, if you're going for authentic French, the Salade Niçoise is a good bet (although it has a bit too much dressing for my taste)."}
{"text":"Merlot was a happy accident. I was out looking for a place to chow with my dad and ended up happening upon this nice little spot. The house made gerkins and pate are great, and the onion soup is in my top five... I was happy to find a French place cranking out decent fair within striking distance of my place... will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Unpretentious and tasty. Classic French cuisine in a room small enough for that extra bit of attention. Order wine."}
{"text":"Found this place by recommendation from our hotel. Ambience was nice, not too crowded when we arrived. Food was just okay though. A bit pricey and nothing spectacular to mention. Service was very friendly though, which helped offset the average food and higher than it should have been cost. Don't think we would return based on taste and cost but didn't hate the place either."}
{"text":"Went here on the Winterlicious menu on Friday night. I had the French Onion Soup for an appetizer - pretty good but I found it a little bland. Don't know that it's supposed to be spicy but I'm Indian so I like a little spice in pretty much everything I eat.

For the main I had the Chicken Merquez; I really liked the provencale sauce that was on there, it had a bit of a kick to it. The fries were light and crispy, just how I like them.

For dessert, I had the flan which was ok, nothing to write home about. The fresh cream that comes on the side is really nice.

Loved the ambiance, there are French paintings/posters covering all of the walls. Service was also attentive and friendly.

Overall, it was good, but definitely not the best French food I've eaten."}
{"text":"Great local French place! Love the food. Service could be better and a bit crowded and lout when full but good atmosphere. I regularly go back."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and quickly fixed error on bill. Food was meh - nothing inspiring or exceptional or even really good. The peach Melba dessert looked like it came with canned peaches."}
{"text":"Yelp doesn't allow for a 4.5 rating but that's my true opinion of this place. The food is orgasmic and the smells of each dish is intoxicating. Everything is made with fresh foods that are in season. The portion sizes are just right. The wait-staff is very considerate, polite, and accommodating.  I went with a large group and the only problem we had was that we neglected to let the staff know that each person was covering their own tab so they combined all the orders into one and could not reverse it.

The only reason why I could not give this place a 5 is because it is not accessible. The entrance has double doors that would be nearly impossible to navigate for anyone with a mobility issue. The washrooms are located downstairs which is also a problem for those with mobility issues. The space inside the restaurant is tight so there isn't much room for those with wheelchairs, walkers, or rollators to get around and be seated."}
{"text":"Fine French dining - it almost epitomizes the restaurant experience. When you think of fancy restaurants, it's what usually springs to mind. Merlot doesn't disappoint in this respect. 

It's a trim menu of very traditional French food as Merlot clearly subscribes to the edict - do a small list of food really, really well. Plus they also offer some fresh seafood as daily specials. 

Even with the short menu, there's something for most. So if you'd like to enjoy the ambiance (walls lined with French art gallery posters) but eat a steak - they can accommodate you. 

I had the trio of sausages, which were a little over-cooked for my liking, but still tasted good. The rest of my party was a mixture of surf and turf and all seemed at least pleased with their meal.

As someone else commented the wine list is a little short - but the wine we did choose was delicious so I'm wondering if the limited wines they do carry were expertly chosen as the best.

I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to experiment with traditional French cuisine and get your feet wet. The prices are reasonable and the service was good even on a busy night."}
{"text":"Great dinner, horrible service.  4 girls, lots of excellent food and wine.  Had to ask for bread, water and then we weren't even offered dessert."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening, the place was pretty quiet - probably 5 or 6 other tables in the main dining room. The lights were dimmed early making for a nice atmosphere. 

Smoked salmon appetizer was great. The escargot were done in Provençal style without the usual garlic butter overload. 

For the main I had the trio of sausages, which was ok. It certainly wasn't spectacular, but this could be expected given the price. However, chocolate mousse desert was very very good. 

All in all a good dinner for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hostess is an impeccably lovely older lady. Pity the rest of the staff don't measure up.

Apparently the waitresses here don't do table checks. If they did they could have learned a great deal about the steak frites they were serving. Or perhaps they knew the fries came out cold and soggy and were too clever to ask?

An alternate theory is they knew it was the chef's first night cooking and thoughtfully wished to avoid destroying his confidence with the news that his rare steak was blue and his medium rare steak a tough medium well. Perhaps this style of neo French cooking is done without the aid of such modern implements as thermometers, instead choosing the classic technique of screwing up hundred and fifty dollar meals until the customers finally learn they're better off just heading to the Swiss restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Etoibicoke; land of chicken wings and Molson Canadian .
Really ', can it be explained that not a single dining establishment of merit can be found?
West , North - interesting ethnic,. The rest best, found in downtown( loosely ). Given current transportation  issues where could the East be?
As a French restaurant , this was a bad joke.
Tasteless steak, same for chop; consistent with my other trials.
Frites Good.
Dumb wines.
Wealthy Kingsway: the bland leading the bland?"}
{"text":"Note: Winterlicious Review

The atmosphere was nice and cozy, with candles lighting up the space. The servers were for the most part attentive and warm. 

I liked the daily soup I ordered as my appetizer, which was a red pepper and tomato soup. The fruit flan I had for dessert was also good.
The steak I had as the main was a miss for me. It was quite thin and broke apart easily, which is not something I expect from a steak dish.

Nothing about the food was extraordinary, but nothing about it was bad either.
A plus is that the plating was done nicely, and enjoyable for the eyes (pictures attached)."}
{"text":"Love this place we go here every week practicality. Extremely friendly staff and amazing food. Huge portions especially for the pasta dishes. Gets very busy so dine earlier if you enjoy dinning in a quiet atmosphere"}
