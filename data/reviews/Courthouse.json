{"text":"Pretty decent venue with the open floors downstairs and a top balcony level."}
{"text":"The good news? It's right next to Terroni. The bad news? The beer selection, at least for the night I was there, was Bud and Bud Light. What? Isn't there some kind of Canadian content law for beer? OK, I wasn't expecting Mill St. or Amsterdam but not even Molson or Labatt? I did see some empty cases of Stella so maybe I came on a bad night.  Place itself is loud but I like the back room with the couches. There's also free WiFi if you can find the manager and he gives you the password. Even still, he gave me the wrong one and I finally figured out on my own to place a period in between the letter and number sequences. At least they had it.  Skipped the beer for obvious reasons and tried a screwdriver. Very weak. Mostly tasted of Minute Maid. So even the drinks aren't so hot. It's a decent start but it's got a long way to go to be a really great downtown club. Stick to Terroni and go drinking somewhere else for now."}
{"text":"I went here for a work party. Its a beautiful building!! I can't believe it used as a club. Reminds me of 'This is London' but more authentic architecture. They had a fireplace inside...is that really a safe idea with drunk people around? Iron bars and all, people can be pretty ridic when they drink...  So because it was a work party, I ended up taking full advantage of the free drinks tickets on my possession. After becoming highly inebriated, I danced the night away! lol, the music was terrific. The people...were mixed. I actually much appreciated it was a work party. The 'other' people that were there, well some of them looked a bit punk/were a little rough on the dance floor. I suppose I'm saying I might not go back there for just a regular night of fun. But to put that in perspective, you're not likely to find me at the docks (is it still called that? yes I'm old) or the government (ok are these the same places? I dont even know...)  You know what I love about 'nice' clubs-they have nice bathrooms. This place sure did. And for those of you who have endured nasty bathrooms in not-so-nice clubs, you will understand my appreciation :)  Oh I should mention, I'm pretty sure there is cover on weekends $20. But again, because it was a work thing, we didn't pay!  And my friend (designated driver!) parked on the street for free, no problems at all"}
{"text":"There are times in life when spending the rent money on a single meal is actually a pleasure, and can be part of one of those evenings that's the stuff of special memories for years to come.    There is a bare handful of truly first-class, exquisite, opulent places in Toronto where your dining experience is so much more than food on a plate, where only the finest in your wardrobe will suit you, where you want to make marriage proposals or celebrate a major anniversary or otherwise ritually mark the most sublime and special of occasions in life.  When I know I'm going to plan such an evening with a special partner, it's the Courthouse Market Grille that I personally keep in my back pocket.    I don't have to tell you what's on the menu, but I'll definitely recommend their steaks.  You should already know that it'll be among the best meals you'll hope to have.  Ever.  Trust me."}
