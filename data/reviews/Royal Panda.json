{"text":"Best Chinese food hands down .I've been coming here for over a decade and the quality is always consistent.I have no had on bad meal from here ,the staff is extremely pleasant ,here 's another decade!"}
{"text":"Just moved this area. The food was good and the service was nice , the guy in the front is cute btw"}
{"text":"We lived in Ayrsley and Royal Panda along with Dragon Buffet were the best.  Everything they did tasted wonderful and sweet/sour but delicious spices!  They also have buffet take out and after 4 pm would lower the rate for the remains of the day buffet.  RP doesn't deliver to Quail Hollow, but I still will drive to get the good food.  I just hope Lotus II will be comparable.  Cherry House has let me down and sometimes tastes like old, dry, callous epidermis...  Sorry CH, but I love RP and DP so far.  KGS"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few weekends ago. Ordered the Chicken and shrimp with broccoli lunch combo and an order of fried Chicken wings. The Chicken wings were good. They weren't the best I've ever had but it was well marinated and fresh. The sauce on the chicken and shrimp with broccoli was decent."}
{"text":"It tastes pretty decent for your average Chinese takeout.  I was going to give it 3 stars because the delivery took an hour when my estimated delivery time was for 35 minutes. However, the serving sizes are very large for the very affordable prices! Not to mention the large soup size for only $1.50! For a family of 6 we ordered 4 soups and 4 entrees with plenty of food leftover, thus earning it another star."}
{"text":"Come back trip from ,Crowders Mountain State Park ,you can never go wrong here. Everything has a great authentic taste that is uniquely its own. The wings are killer.and also great service,we will back soon."}
{"text":"I have had both there sesame chicken and their orange chicken. Both were delivered and both were very hot and delicious.  The orange chicken had some spicy heat to it and was very yummy.  They put tons of the sauce in for you so you have plenty for dipping.  The delivery is very cheap. It's pretty good chinese.  Oh and I had one of the wings from my friends food and it was finger licking good!"}
{"text":"Quite a few Chinese places have sprung up around Ayrsley recently, but Royal Panda has been there longer than any of them.  The decor is dated, but they have a great lunch buffet (as long as you like chicken!).  The buffet selection may not be as vast as other places, and the dishes aren't as exotic, but everything they offer tastes like it's their specialty.  I'm particularly fond of the Spicy Bourbon Chicken and the General Tso's Chicken.  The fried rice is notably good, too.  And it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Royal panda might have been having a bad day but when i called in to order for delivery I was told it would be 30 minutes, it took an hour and 30 minutes to arrive and my order was incorrect, not to mention they also charge a large deliver fee that is not mentioned anywhere...despite a chinese place typically delivering for free if you order over $15.00 worth of food."}
{"text":"I ordered Royal Panda at 10:30 thinking it would take a while to cook. They were knocking at my door at 10:45...The best chinese food in my life. Im afraid to order a second time, it might lose the best in NC title. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered sesame chicken with fried rice, ribs and 4 piece chicken wings with fried rice. Was not that good should have just stop at my regular spot for Chinese. The sesame chicken was a bit to soggy they forgot to add the veggies and pork to my fried rice it was just plain yellow rice. Ribs were over cooked and hard. Chicken were ok didn't like the concept of them placing the fried chicken over my rice which makes it soggy also. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery; was told 35 minutes by person that took order. Food finally showed up 1:20 minutes later. Poor service and mediocre food. Won ton soup waaaay too salty, chicken fried rice and crab wontons passable. No return business from me."}
{"text":"I was home sick from work in the middle of the week and had no inclination to turn the ingredients in my refrigerator into a meal and no desire to interact with people or fight through the lunch rush. Thankfully I recalled somewhere in my fuzzy brain a previous order from Royal Panda and went straight to the Google. Royal Panda has teamed up with Beyond Menu so I was able to make my selections and submit payment without even talking to anyone. 

I was surprised to find chicken noodle soup on the menu - score! I also ordered the Szechuan Chicken lunch special. One of the great things about Royal Panda is the ability to have 3 crab rangoons with your combo instead of the standard egg roll. Also the lunch combo and dinner combo are the same price which I remembered as being a benefit last time I ordered.

The food arrived in about 20 minutes which was one of the quickest delivery times I have ever experienced! The chicken soup was interesting, like a soupy lo mien instead of the traditional American chicken soup, but I was a fan. The lunch combo was more than enough food and had plenty of spice to help clear my head. 

The food was pretty standard but the option for crab rangoons and more importantly the speedy delivery time bump this location up to my new go to Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"I wanted to delete my previous review rather than lower the boom on these guys. But yelp isn't having any of that. No delete for you! So the last three meals from this place has been worse than the last. I'm guessing the cook quit? Hey owners, What ever he wants in pay, pay it!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte, NC for the weekend, their menu was in the hotel I stayed in (Sleep Inn). 
Delivery was as stated, 20-30min. Food was delivered hot and decent for takeout. 
Chicken wings actually had a batter as compared to Boston where the trend is no batter, 
just fried in oil. 
Shrimp lo mein had thick noodles and lots of mini shrimp. 
Crab rangoon, too much rangoon compared to the tasty crab filling. 

Last thing and what prompted me do this review, I come home and get on line to check my bank account and I see another charge on my account for an additional $2 pending, 3 days after the original charge. I called the restaurant and spoke to \"Dennis\" the manager.  After I explained the reason for my call, he replied that if the $2 was'nt a tip, (I didn't remember if I gave one) then it was a \"pre-charge\" that banks do like gas stations do when you use the gas pumps with a credit card.  He said he'd call me back in 24-48 to confirm, and that I should watch my account in the same time. 
I appreciate the good customer service. We'll see."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service sucked. Guy answered. I ordered honey chicken combination. He told me no combination, only 1 size. I told him I had menu in front of me. He goes \"okay, your right\". I also ordered 6 wings and Lo mein. Then then tells me total and hangs up. This was a delivery. I had to call back and give credit card. He was very short and not nice. 2 starts cuz service sucked. Good average."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese food for a low price."}
