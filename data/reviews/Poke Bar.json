{"text":"Amazing experience. Friendly staff and awesome food. Will be back very frequently."}
{"text":"OMG! So yummy! First time here and I can say for sure it won't be my last! Very fresh and flavorful! 
Staff is very friendly and helpful (Thank You Jared!)"}
{"text":"Delicious, surprisingly fresh seafood at a great price! Can't wait to go back. Love the idea of take out and so close to home. The  house tuna with spicy house dressing was amazing. I'm telling everyone I know about this place so that it stays open!"}
{"text":"I have been to poke bar so many times at different locations. To be honest, I really love the food. But this location has THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. I ordered the large bowl but the girl gave me only half scoop of protein. I asked if I could get a full scoop and she gave me the attitude. Very bad impression. My friends had the same experience too. Not recommend to buy food here when there are girls serving!!! This place doesn't even deserve my 1 star!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service, and customer service! They are very helpful and friendly! The Pokebowls are delicious."}
{"text":"Thrilled the west valley finally has an amazing poke restaurant! Fresh, quick, healthy, simple"}
{"text":"Wow this spot is INCREDIBLE! An amazing poke selection, fresh, flavorful, and mouth watering. The veggie selection and sauces are on point. The staff was helpful, friendly, and full of smiles! I literally commented after each bite I ate. Highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who loves poke."}
{"text":"We LOVED this spot!  FINALLY!!!! A Poke spot on the west side!  

If you want to eat fresh and healthy and can't decide on food selection on Bell Road, choose this place!  After a workout, lunch, whatever...  this place won't leave you feeling like a slob afterwards!  I loved their Hawaiian Tuna and house sauce on the other selections. 

I would definitely come back!  Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place  just across Arrowhead Starbucks !!! Good healthy eating . Glad they open up this side of town ."}
{"text":"I have never left a review before but I enjoyed the whole experience here that I felt compelled to share... I loved the food! At first I wasn't sure what Poke was. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They explained everything. You get a good amount of food for the money. The restaurant itself is spotlessly clean and has a very comfortable atmosphere. I look forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Love that you can make your own bowl and put whatever you want in it. Food was fresh as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch, it was his first time trying raw fish, he was hesitant but so happy he tried. The staff was great, walked him through the process and different options. I had the spicy tuna and shrimp with brown rice and spicy house sauce. He had the Hawaiian tuna, spicy tuna and house sauce. I really enjoyed all the topping options (edamame, cilantro, crab, corn, ginger, cucumber, pineapple, wasabi etc). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I LOVE tuna and this food did not disappoint. Tuna was good. Tasted quality. Not old. And all the toppings were so good. Very impressed. Don't be fooled by the portion sizes. I was very full after eating a medium bowl."}
{"text":"I go to Pokè Bar at least once a week and it's incredible. Lots of selection, always fresh, and inexpensive for the amount of food that you get. In the hot weather, it's a great cold and healthy meal."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star review that's what I would give them! Very rude customer service before I even started to order I walked out! How can u enjoy a meal when spoken to so rudely!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Staff is super nice and it's awesome to finally have a poke place on the west side. They have a great bar of toppings and the portions are very generous! I went with the masago, cucumber salad, brown rice, green onions, crunchy onions and garlic, and avocado- all very fresh!
The house spicy sauce is ACTUALLY spicy- a miracle! If you love spicy, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! She would eat it everyday if she could. The fish is always fresh and the service is always fast. For a to go order you're in and out in 5 minutes. So glad we finally got one on the west side."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch on their grand opening week. I have to say I'm quite disappointed. They need to work on their presentation. When they served me my food, they didn't even try to make it look nice. The portions of the fish were small. My server just threw everything into the bowl without a care. When it came time to eat it, the rice was so undercooked, I didn't bother eating the rest of it. I just ate the fish and toppings and threw the rest away. I'm also questioning the quality of their ingredients because I felt a bit sick after eating their food. I eat raw sushi on a weekly basis, and I never have gotten sick from sushi before. I'd rather eat sushi bought at the grocery store. The only reason I'm giving two stars is the customer service was great. I'm glad that I only paid for 50% of the price though. I'll maybe give them a second chance in a few months, considering they just opened and I shouldn't expect everything to be perfect. But there definitely is a lot a room for improvement."}
{"text":"Take my money! I will never go anywhere for sushi when I can come here and get large amount of tuna for $11! First time have a poke bowl and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened near where I live and, because of that, I go more often than I should. This is like sushi in a bowl, chipotle style. The food is great: you can pick between different tuna, salmon, egg, octopus, shrimp, scallops, etc for the \"fish\" part, then choose if you want that over salad, rice (brown or white), combo, or chips (awesome idea). You then add on different sides and dressings in your poke bowl. The food is always fresh and delicious. Definitely the best poke I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Also, aside from that, they carry MACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES. They're amazing and I have to admit, I've come solely for those sandwiches and I've come twice in a day after lunch for more ice cream sandwiches. Everyone working there is extremely helpful and friendly. They also have a reward system to give you a free poke bowl. Definitely 5 stars all around"}
{"text":"Recommended! New, clean place with fresh food. I don't think there is many places in town that offers this much good Asian/Hawaiian food. Prices are little higher than most fast food places, but with all the quality still pays off."}
{"text":"I love this place every time I go the food is great.
Make sure if you are not going to eat your poke right away. Go easy on the oil.
This is the type of fast food you want to Consume immediately for best flavor.
No need for fast food guilt at this place."}
{"text":"This is now my go to lunch spot. Fan freaking tastic on the service & the food! Fresh & healthy! I got a small bowl with the Hawaiian tuna & mango. The small was a pretty giant portion once I added the greens & toppings so I can't imagine eating the medium or large. Everything I added was fresh & delicious. The sweet chili sauce was spicier than expected, which combined with my mango & cucumbers was the perfect combo. The seafood salad & crunchy toppings made my day! Please go here-you won't regret it."}
{"text":"So happy there's now a Poké-Bar in Deer Valley. The staff is amazing! Portions are worth every cent. I got a Small Bowl and still had left overs. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go! The bowls are a little pricey but it's fish so that is to be expected. You do get a lot of food though, very filling. Staff was very helpful since it was a new concept/dining experience for me."}
{"text":"Omgggggg this place is delicious!! I'm so glad there's a new healthy lunch option! I got shrimp and spicy tuna with white rice and a bunch of mix ins and house spicy and sweet chili  flavoring with cucumber salad and crab meat. Everything was soooo good! The cucumber salad had an amazing taste to it and the crab meat was delicious!! I will say my bowl was super spicy but I had spicy tuna, jalapeños, house spicy flavoring and I topped it with chili powder but it was still good!  
The best part.....I got a Mango Macaron Ice Cream
Sandwich and it was soooooo good! It wasn't to sweet and was beyond delicious. 
I definitely recommend and I will be coming a lot!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to a poke restaurant, and I'm glad this was my first experience. The staff was very friendly and informative. The quality of the fish was delightful and the quantity was just right. Well priced for what you receive. My husband and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Incredibly excited that I don't have to drive all the way  to Scottsdale for something like this. The customer service is very helpful everytime we go in. The food is always really fresh. You definitely need to get one of the macaroon ice cream sandwiches before you leave!"}
{"text":"So we thought this was similar to a Mongolian barbecue where you choose the ingredients you like and they cook it, but that is not the case. It's more of a sushi style place which we didn't realize until after we paid and neither me or my husband could stomach raw tuna. So we grabbed a to go too and pan seared the tuna then threw it back in and it was DELICIOUS! So good, the flavors were amazing there was just enough spicy  in it but it wasn't overwhelming. It was really good and I would def recommend trying it. If raw fish isn't your thing I suggest having the meat on the side and then cooking it a little at home."}
{"text":"I love Poké Bar!! I'm so excited to have another one close by! I love that when I go in to any Poké Bar I can expect the consistent brand and same fresh selection of items. I went to the soft opening last night and I got basically what I expected to get. This location seemed to not give as generous of portions with the toppings, almost skimpy compared to their other locations (may have been because of newness or maybe because the bowls were half price). However I will return and will 100% recommend to anyone that will listen to what I have to say."}
{"text":"This was so good! So fresh and lots of amazing flavors! Inside looks great. Bright and clean with a very hip feel. This is what this area needed! I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"I will say that it's still my favorite place and my go-to place for Poke, I mean I go there every to every other week (even last night). However I will say that it seems the employee turnover seems high and lately they've had some really crabby people to work there and the portion sizes have gone down. Your job is customer service, act like it. Also, they recently switched over to FiveStars for their loyalty program instead of having the punch cards.  The punch cards were more favorable to the customers and you have to buy more bowls to get your freebie with their new program. One final thing that annoys me is with their birthday \"reward,\" it's buy a bowl and get a macaroon for a dollar. So you aren't really even getting a reward, it's just a way to get you to spend more money. Stop getting so cheap Poke Bar, I want to keep loving you!"}
{"text":"Love it. 

Totally coming back here. Food was yummy and the employees were very nice. 

It's reasonably priced and considering how I can eat like a beast, I was full. 

I had the spicy tuna, scallops, and Hawaiian tuna. Their \"sides\" that I had was the cucumber salad and crab mix. The dressing that I had was the wasabi shoyu. It sounds spicier than it is. It was better than I expected. Everything tastes fresh and it was all well balanced. They even offer mango and pineapple and corn, but I didn't have any of that in mine. They top the scallops with fuikake, and they also have dry toppings to add some crunch if you like.  It comes with a scoop of rice too. The medium bowl is $12.95 with 3 proteins. The small bowl is $8.95 with 2 proteins. The large bowl has 4 proteins. 

Drink options are some coke products at a soda fountain and some bottled beverages. 

Bonus: macaron ice cream sandwiches. For $3.50 they are totally worth it."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so dang good!!!!! The portions are very big. I get the small plate which comes with 2 proteins of your choice rice two sides and addins. The Hawaiian tuna is bomb!!! The shrimp is also very good. Plenty of add in choices and the house dressing and spicy mayo are a MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in heaven! I've tried a couple of places for poke and Poke Bar by far exceeds. Fresh and alot for the money. It's down the street from my house so this will be so convenient.
The employees were friendly and quickly asked if it was my first time. I said yes so they explained the process/menu. I hope they keep up the quality, quantity, freshness and value."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I am not very impressed spent $14 for a small.  I guess I have to pay extra for for a normal scoop of protein, that I get at my other location off of Bell Road.  Service was poor by one employee but I guess that's what they are told to do.    Will not be back"}
{"text":"Out of all the poké places I've been to in the Phoenix area so far, this one is my favorite because the fish is SO fresh! I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've never tried a poke bowl before. But when this place opened up by work, I wanted to try it. I took a few coworkers with me and we all had bowls. I got the medium bowl which gives you three choices of protein. It's set up Chipotle style where you move through the line and pick your toppings/ingredients.

There are quite a few choices for filling your bowl including tortilla chips if you're not in the mood for rice. The only complaint I have is there's no soda machine or fountain for water (they informed me that is being added tomorrow). 

The food was very tasty and I'm happy to have a healthier alternative for lunch when I'm at work. I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place, its like getting a super sweet deal on sashimi. The fish is good quality and the staff is really friendly. The value of quality ingredients is impressive and the atmosphere is laid back and casual. This has become a favorite spot for my family.

From memory, they have Hawaiian poke, tuna, spicy tuna, octopus, scallops & shrimp. They offer sesame oil to start & add in any other mix ins you'd like (jalepenos, cilantro, kale, cucumber, edamame, red onions,etc.) And top it off with the sauce of your choice plus additional fixings. This is all placed atop the base of your choice of white or brown rice, baby kale, spring mix or half and half of two."}
{"text":"Thank you all so much for being so nice and accommodating! My first time in, I was not familiar with how this worked, but I was taken great care of and had the most delicious meal. Super healthy and very fresh. So many flavors exploding in your mouth. So I take my mom tonight and I couldn't go in because I had my puppy... I knew they would take care of her and explain how the Poke Bar worked. I quickly went in after her for my second meal at this location and yet again, sooooo so so so good! Mom was VERY happy with her meal as well! And she is not a sushi fan :) This is my favorite place to grab a bite that is super delicious and very healthy. Quality meats and vegetables... pretty and fresh! and very clean facility. You guys rock! See ya soon!"}
{"text":"Either I am not getting the concept of the place, or my person who prepared my salad thingie wasn't skilled at her job. It was nice that they had a decent selection of seafoods, but many ARE NOT poke...they were just plain seafood :-(   They give you just a small little scoop of the protein and then you end up with a weird salad effect.  I have had much better other places and never had anything like this in Hawaii."}
{"text":"This poke is awesome! Fresh, light, and flavorful. I got the large with Hawaiian tuna, spicy albacore, octopus/shrimp tossed in sweet chili, and finished with crab and seaweed salad. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent poke on this side of town for your poke cravings.  Prices are a bit steep for the quantity, but that's to be expected given its rarity in this area.  I get tired of rice only, so I usually get half rice, half salad, but even then there's too much rice.  I would most definitely return, and that's not just because it's the only poke place in the area or because it has a stamp card.  The quality of their fish is pretty good too.  That being said, I've had fresher and more tender fish and been at places that give you more bang for your buck.  Still, this place is excellent to try and to keep on returning to."}
{"text":"I am so glad they have a poke bar near me now!!! It was so delicious and I will absolutely be back very soon. I want to add that the staff was so sweet and helpful! I hope we keep them busy because this is just such an awesome place to have in our area!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted as we walked in by friendly employees as they were opening up for lunch. The food was clearly displayed and the choices were numerous. I will definitely be coming back and inviting friends."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. The food is fresh and wonderful. The staff is very helpful as all. Do yourself a favor and go enjoy it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try a poke bar for a while and WOW! We have clearly been missing out! The staff was super patient with us navigating all the choices and gave us samples when asked. My husband isn't as big of a raw fish fan as I am and he was blown away by how good this was! We both got medium bowls- I mixed scallops, tuna, and salmon with tons of delicious toppings including seaweed salad and kale. We will absolutely be stopping by a lot! So good!"}
{"text":"I'm in love. Everything is so fresh and delicious and doesn't make you feel bad after. I wish i could take this place back to Michigan. I had this on my first day of vacationing and I've been craving It everyday since. The staff are so friendly and kind and let me taste test almost everything to make sure I'd make the perfect bowl. Thank you poke!"}
{"text":"I am new to poke.. drove by a place in Tempe not too long ago.. read up and wanted to try.. I really liked it. hard to say the best as this is the first place that I have been. The guys behind the counter made it easy to navigate. everything was very good. I figure why mess with a good thing.. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a Poke Restaurant but my daughter is a fan.  We went to Poke Bar after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The staff was extremely helpful considering I had no idea what to order.  Luckily we showed up a few minutes before noon and the rush.  I ordered the medium which came with 3 scoops of protein.  I am a little skittish about eating uncooked food so I had the octopus and shrimp (both were precooked) and the spicy tuna (which was raw but marinated).  The tuna was excellent but the octopus was tasteless and the shrimp was mediocre.  Now that I know what to order I will be back.  Don't make the my mistake.  If you want to eat Poke....eat the real Poke and disregard the pedestrian precooked choices."}
{"text":"I've tried all of the different ones in town and this place is the best. This location in particular is amazing. The service hasn't been bad once. The portions are normal for poké and avocado is extra per usual. The rice here is the best. Most places it's hard and gross. Here it's fresh and delicious. Their house dressing is amazing. But the best thing is the cucumber salad that is an add on. It's a little bit pickled but in the best way. I really can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"The Poke Bar is delicious. It will not disappoint the average Joe's in the world. If you are new to the Poke world I would HIGHLY suggest this place. It's environment is super chill, modern and clean. The staff is polite and can answer questions on the spot about their food. I've been to common Poke places around the West valley; however, this is my number one joint."}
{"text":"So yummy!!! Highly highly recommend! Only downside is that the portions are a bit too big for me and with raw fish you can not really bring it home and save it for later... it's unsafe :/."}
{"text":"Such a perfect fast, fresh, and delicious healthy way to go!!:) excited to know your near.  Playing my island music and peaceful atmosphere just perfect to spend the afternoon!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I am new to poke and have some diet restrictions. Counter staff have been very helpful with ingredient descriptions and with ordering in general. Great selection; all fish is very fresh and very good!"}
{"text":"Amazing idea to have a Poke bar! I got the small with a kale base and topped it with crunchy garlic and ponzu sauce, super delicious and fresh! Don't forget to have one of their macaron ice cream sandwiches, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I was on the west side for an errand and was considering a protein burger at In-and-Out, as it was the first place I saw and was pretty hungry. I was thinking of how heavy it would be, then I Just Barely spotted this place. Everything was super fresh and the value for how much food you get is considerable. I don't come out to this side of town too often, but next time I do, I have some incentive to come hungry."}
{"text":"Are those chopsticks or are you just happy to sashimi? 

Yup, I'm on that Poke train! I've been here a dozen times now, so I guess you can call me a fan of this place. If you're scared of raw fish, this might not be the place for you. It might be worth the try because you can't really taste the raw fish after smothering in that dressing and all the toppings. Oh, if you don't like choices, this place is not for you. 

How it works: 
1. You open the door and walk in. Hold the door for others if they're within walking distance. Don't be rude. 
2. Choose a size (small, medium, or large).  This will depend on how many scoops of \"protein\" or the raw fish you get. Medium or large is generally pretty filling for me. And I eat a lot. 
3. Choose a base (white or brown rice, noodles, salad). My go to is the rice.
4. Choose a protein (Tuna, Salmon, Tofu, Albacore, Spicy Tuna, Scallop
Shrimp, Octopus). You can mix and match. I generally get the tuna and salmon. The fish always look freshly cut. 
5. Choose a sauce (House Dressing, Ponzu, Spicy Mayo, Sweet Chili, Wasabi Mayo, Wasabi Shoyu, Shoyu, Gluten Free Soy Sauce). You can mix the sauces as well. I always get the house dressing and/or spicy mayo. Then, they mix it and ask if you want sesame sauce to enhance the flavor. 
6. Choose any of the mix-in (Corn, Jalapeno, Edamame, Cilantro, Kale, Cucumber, Sweet onion, Green onion, Pineapple). You can add all of them, some of them, or none of them! I'm a pineapple type of guy, so I get that... corn, edamame, cilantro, and cucumbers. 
7. Choose 2 sides (Cucumber Salad, Seaweed Salad, Imitation Crab). 
8. Choose toppings (Avocado (cost extra), Ginger, Wasabi, Masago, Crispy Onion, Crispy Garlic, Mixed Nuts). I get the masago (small orange fish eggs or something. Idk, I just eat it) and crispy garlic. 

They have a variety of different drinks that might be worth trying out too. The Macaroon ice creams are OK and nothing mind blowing. The workers there are really patient with the orders and can explain the above process really well. I don't have a lot of poke places to compare it to (yet) but I would recommend this place.

{"text":"Picked up two bowls, which were both delicious. (tuna better than salmon though.) Beware that the spicy mayo and the spicy tuna are both pretty spicy. Loved the addition of avocado."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Poke, very good, very flavorful. Slightly on the pricey side for what you're getting but not too bad. Quality of the food is top notch though. Great selection and very fresh tasting. If you've never had Poke before it's not a tiny monster on your phone causing you to wreck your car because THE LIGHT IS RED AND THERE WILL BE MORE PIKACHUS IN THE FUTURE, PLEASE WATCH THE ROAD, no... It's a delicious, traditional Hawaiian style cuisine involving sushi like raw fish mixed with rice and toppings. It's like a cross between Sushi and Teriyaki. Very yummy. 

I would say however, they need to make sure that the staff better communicates what is free, what is unlimited and what is not.It seems like each time I've gone in it's been different. The staff is good but almost seem a bit cocky at times, just something they might want to look out for."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum! Sooo sooo good! We got the small portion (2 scoops of protein) and both had more than enough to eat. Love they have all the cool San Pelligrinos drinks. The Hawaiian Tuna was our favorite! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot! Not only was the food innovative and mouth watering but the customer service was way above and beyond!!! I have been a restaurant manager for 17 years so I know a gem employee when I see one. Hayley was so amazing with me and my kids and gave us samples since my kids had no clue what they wanted. She is an A+++ team member! I am sure we were super annoying. haha. Haley made us feel so welcome and made sure the kids got something they would love! Will be back to annoy her more often! :)"}
{"text":"So grateful to have such a fresh and healthy option for lunch in the area! 

The staff were friendly- greeted me, walked me through the options, and gave me a punch card toward to encourage future poke lunches.

The restaurant was clean and well stocked, and the seafood and veggie options looked tantalizing! I opted for a small bowl with a Spring Mix base, traditional and spicy tuna, and a variety of mix ins including avocado for an additional $1 charge. I mixed ponzu with spicy mayo for a flavorful sauce! 

It will be hard to try something different when my bowl turned out perfectly! Cheers to poke once a week!"}
{"text":"Loved this concept of creating your own poke bowl. My hubby and I are already discussing the next combinations we want to try. The fish is very fresh and delicious. The workers were very helpful and informative in creating our bowls. Definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite lunch spot. I am usually at Chipotle next door, and mad I hadn't tried this place earlier. The service was excellent, and they were very helpful in providing samples, as well as helping me understand how to order (nah it wasn't as easy as I thought, until they explained lol). Besides that, the price was reasonable, and the food was SO GOOD. SO FRESH. And not overfilling, but satisfying. I will be back. Tomorrow."}
{"text":"Oh my! Love is the only word I can use! I walk in and see fresh sushi, salads and rice and I knew this was going to be a great poke place, but they went the extra mile when that asked me all the right questions, making building the perfect bowl easy! I would take a picture but I could not stop eating. 

I ate spicy tuna (3 scoops!) with half white rice and half spring salad mix. Topped it off with green onions, cucumber thinly sliced and a bit of kale for good measure. Then I had two scoops of cucumber salad on the side.

I really wanted to take a picture, but my taste buds would not have it. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun concept, fresh food, large portions. Poke Bar does not disappoint. Thanks fellow Yelpers for your reviews and recommendations. My family and I went to our West Side Poke Bar. 

Tip: The lines were long even at 1:20 PM on a Saturday afternoon. We thought we were beating the lunch crowd. Kudos to our Poke Bar Assembly Servers, the lines moved quickly and before we even decided what we wanted, we were at the head of the line.

First you choose a size: Small, Medium and Large. I chose the Small and still, the portion size was substantial. The Small round up to $9. The Medium rounds up to $10. I forgot how much the large was. As I said, the service was so fast that I had to make decisions quickly.

First, the foundation. You have a choice of white rice, brown rice, spring mix greens, nacho and kale was a dollar extra. You also have the option of half and half. I opted for half brown rice and half spring mix greens to increase my fiber intake. 

Step 2: Proteins. They had a variety of proteins: Hawaiian Tuna, tuna, scallop, octopus, spicy tuna, spicy albacore, salmon, tofu and shrimp. I chose the scallop with mayo and the Hawaiian Tuna. The flavors in the marinated Hawaiian Tuna was en pointe. I will definitely get it again. The scallops with mayo was okay, but I probably will try the Spicy Albacore next. By the way, the preparation is raw. The portions are generous. 

Step 3: Mix-Ins: They put a paper bowl with sesame oil to toss the veggies that you want to put in: cilantro, chopped kale, edamame, scallions, red onion, cucumber. Pick as many of these as you want..I chose kale, edamame, scallions, pineapple, jalapeno, corn and cucumber. You can also add Furikake or seaweed sprinkles, fried scallions, fried garlic.

Step 4: Chose your dressing:Poke Bar recommends combining 2. The House dressing was delish with the Wasabi Shoyu. I tried my son's Spicy Mayo. That packed a punch. Other dressing options included Ponzy dressing, Sweet Chili and the Spicy House dressing. They add the dressing to the veggie mix and top it on the foundation. 

Step 5: Pick 2 sides. I chose imitation crab meat servings and masago (fish roe). They also offer seaweed salad, cucumber salad. On their website, they had miso soup, but I didn't see that offered. Avocado is extra. 

My family and I enjoyed our meal thoroughly. My Small bowl was big enough for a snack later on. The bowl is disposable, and it was easy to take the rest of my food home! I will be back for more Poke at Pokebar!"}
{"text":"So fabulous and affordable! I order the small size which is actually quite large. The fish is fabulous and fresh. No complaints. They have gluten free soy sauce too which is huge for me because I have celiac!"}
{"text":"Poke looks yum. I got Hawaiian tuna n spicy albacore. Place looks clean n not crowded yet"}
{"text":"Really good, just like you would expect somewhere like Hawaii.  Little bit pricey for an everyday lunch, but i definitely like coming here on occasion.  The hawaiian tuna with some of the mix ins and the house dressing is a hit and you can go wrong.   I would love to try the octopus with the dressing prep thats on the tuna, but right now they only serve the octopus plain.

Freshness is the key, always has always will be."}
{"text":"Excellent fast food meal. I gave it 5 stars for fast food restaurants in its class. The flavors were popping. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was excited to see the Poke Bar so close to me. I was fortunate to be there when there was a slow moment. I was greeted by a very nice young man and he explained what my choices were. While he was explaining everything to me I was looking over all the containers with the different choices and noticed the containers needed to be filled. But i thought it must be good here if their that busy.!!
My order was to go. When I got home ( I live very close) and tried my poke bowl it was not  fresh tasting as in my poke bowl was fishy!. 
That's the reason for my three stars."}
{"text":"Location is Clean, staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is fresh and healthy ."}
{"text":"In love with this place! They were very helpful since it was my first time. Walked in and was greeted very friendly. Got myself a medium size with 3 scoops and I like how they are not stingy with the scoop! Fish taste fresh to me, and toppings are very fresh. Brown rice is not hard, and their house sauce is very good. I will definitely be back and bring my friends and family here. Great food! So excited a Poke place opened up on the west side."}
{"text":"New spot in town!  Loved the poke, it's delicious!  Great service and very clean because it just opened today!!  They even have ice cream macaron sandwiches.

Will add more later today!  Come out for their soft  opening, it's 50% off! They play Hawaiian music and have organic green tea as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited that a new poke place finally opened up in arizona but as soon as I walked in and started ordering my food....i realized how overpriced it was for the portion you get. They use the tiniest scoop to measure out the toppings and you only get one tiny scoop of everything for a medium box of 12 bucks. If not for the rice that fills u up, you might not even realize that you had just eaten a meal lol otherwise taste was pretty okay, hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. I'm serious, the longest I've gone without having it since it opened in June is 13 days. 

The fish is always delicious and fresh. The rice is the best I've had without sake added."}
{"text":"Although the employees are nice, they are VERY fast! I've been here at least a dozen times and still get overwhelmed by how fast they're wanting me to pick out my sauces/mix ins. You can be the only customer there and they will still rush you to get out. Other than that, the food is VERY good. I've never had a problem with the quality. It's pretty pricey though for the portion size you get."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, there's not A whole lot of poke bowl places in the valley. So when I saw this place opened up I had to check it out. And it is freakin delicious. It's a chipotle style, make your own bowl. They have a BUNCH of options, all delicious. To the point where I'll probably never get the same thing twice.
The fish tasted fresh. They have their own house sauce along with a bunch of others. And it was delicious, light, and satisfying like poke should be!"}
{"text":"Poké is by far one of favorite type of food to date! I'm glad I was able to know its existence last year when I went to Ahi Poki Bowl in Scottsdale, but it was such a hassle to drive all the way (1hr drive, I live in Glendale). I was happy to find out that there is another place that serves Poké called Poki Bar Central (now a 40min drive), which was a bit closer. The food itself did not match Ahi Poki's, but it was good enough to get again. But then behold Poké Bar in Peoria!! 20 minute drive, and by far the best out of the three. I like their selection of proteins and toppings. I like how 3 scoops from here is way cheaper than Ahi Poki. So glad it worked out! I got the Hawaiian Tuna, Spicy Albacore, and Salmon which were all delicious! Definitely making this me place my go-to for Poké!"}
{"text":"Too much rice in the dish, even if you ask for half rice. Rice also needs to be seasoned a bit more.

I added Tako (octopus) to my bowl and it's rubbery and bland tasting. The House Spicy sauce isn't very spicy; I had that plus jalapeños, chili powder, and wasabi in my bowl and it didn't make it spicy. Overall this place is just average."}
{"text":"I discovered this place a few weeks ago and I am already obsessed with it. I have poke at least twice a week and it is so delicious every time. Great prices and generous portions even in the smallest size. I love it !!!!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded my expectations.  I stood there fighting an internal battle.. Philly Cheesesteak or try a Poke Bowl for the first time.  I decided to stay and will be back.  Plus side to it all.....  it's a healthy alternative!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  freindly atmosphere, don't forget the macaroon ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Staff is super awesome every time I go. They are all friendly and patient and remember me when I come in. It is nice to see that they care about what they do. I work close to this location so I typically stop in for food and they do not disappoint. I got them talking and distracted them and was left out a scoop but called back and they fixed it for me. Super good will keep coming back until I get sick of it which for a seafood lover is nowhere in sight so far :)"}
{"text":"Where has this been all my life?! Tried this place for the first time last night and it was amazing. Friendly staff, large selection of fresh healthy food, and fast service. I've never tried poke before and now I regret not trying it sooner!"}
{"text":"$12 for a decent meal with sushi grade ingredients is pretty good deal. The options were good and the food was all good, but I had to decide how I wanted it mixed and made and would've been happier if there was a menu so I could try some proven favorites. Having had real poke before this isn't really poke, but their spin on it was pretty good."}
{"text":"First time having poke and definitely a fan! Such fresh fish. Really delightful and quick to-go option (~15min). The \"small\" options (below) are certainly generous and affordable (~$9). Given the weekday lunchtime busyness, would have picked another one to train an employer at the register to speed things along, albeit it was a cordial environment. Nonetheless, can't wait to visit again and explore the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"2nd time to eat here and it is very good. Great selection of proteins and toppers, very fresh. The restaurant is very clean and well kept and the \"pokeologists\" are very friendly and polite. If your on the 101 or the 17 and are looking for fresh and tasty poke bowls I recommend this Poke Bar."}
{"text":"Love this new place!! Wanted to try something different and something we've heard a lot, and it was so worth it. Please try this place, you'll love it!! We NEED places like this on the west side. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I took my car into Audi Peoria to get the annual service so now I had time to kill. Of course, I yelped a random craving of Poke and to my surprise, there was one near by. So I stopped in.

The place isn't too big, there were maybe about 4 tables and 4 booths?! You order at the food bar and then casual dine-in style, seat yourselves. 

I ordered a small, which was plenty of food, it included 2 scoops of poke, 1 scoop of rice and a choices of sides. 

I picked the Hawaiian Tuna and plain salmon which you were able to create your own. The Hawaiian Tuna was sweet and tangy with onions, sesame oil, and some other seasoning/flavoring- which was delicious. For the salmon, there were so many options and add-ons you can put in, so basically anyone can have their own version of poke. I added edamame, jalapeños, onions, sesame oil, sweet chili sauce, and cucumber. After you chose your add-ons, they hand mixed it on the side then added it to your Poke bowl. 

Then you can choose your sides, I forget what all they had but I added seaweed salad, artificial crab meat, and cucumber salad. All of which are exactly what it sounds like, but the cucumber salad was very vinegar-y. A little more than usual, it was still very tasty but because I'm so sensitive to sour-ish food, I would probably not recommend that. 

After your bowl is complete, you can add up to any 4 dried toppings- shichimi, fried garlic, fried onions, and i forgot the forth! 

The price is very reasonable for the amount of food and what you're getting. A small poke bowl with a small drink all for under $12! Sadly, I'm not in that area much so I cannot return as often as I would like, but I definitely will when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to be living so close to a Poke place. This place was so impressive. I had no idea it was even there but it was and the inside is no nice and clean! The staff was nice and helpful since It was first time. The food and fish was delicious and fresh. Will definitely be going back again and again and again. And they have macaroon ice cream sandwiches!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and the WM PGA tour was in town and that place was dead.  We walked in and no one greeted us.  The place was freezing cold!  When finally greeted we asked why it was literally so cold and she said they had to keep it cold for the fish!?!  Really, usually that takes place in the contained area.  Unwilling to help and telling us that we could eat in our car to go, we left immediately and didn't bother staying!  Koi poke is so much nicer and just 3 minutes North.  We'll never go back there.   They looked too pricey too!"}
{"text":"NOT A PLACE FOR THOSE WITH DECISION PARALYSIS.

Poke Bar is a chain from California and I think I actually have visited a prior location and also been overwhelmed.  It's like Chipotle, but with no context- I've had plenty of burritos and have a good idea of what things will go together, but I haven't made many poke bowls (or any poke bowls).

First you pick your size, which is # scoops of protein + base.  I got a small which had a nice small bowl size of white rice and two scoops of protein.  You can choose brown rice, white rice, tortilla chips, or salad.  Then there are something like EIGHT kinds of protein to choose from.  I'm a math person so I can tell you that there are a LOT of combinations here.  I picked salmon, which is a good standby, and albacore.

Next you slide down to the mix-ins.  I picked cucumber, masago, and green onion.  Too much green onion for me, but was that my fault?  I'm not sure!  I should've picked onion, maybe?  Also there are like eight mix ins and you can pick any of them.

When they mix your proteins with your mix-ins you can also choose any combination of like six sauces?  I picked spicy mayo, ponzu, and sesame oil, and have no idea what contributed what flavors to my bowl.  But it was a suggested sauce-mix from a little laminated piece of paper they had on hand.  There were six or eight combinations of sauce mixes there too.  It was too much.

Surprise!  It comes with two sides!  Luckily there are only three to choose from.  I can unequivocally support the seaweed salad (yum!) and the crab salad.  So I would guess the third choice is also good. 

Then just in case you haven't made enough choices there are toppings at the end.  Furikake, sesame seeds, nuts, crispy garlic, crispy onions (like the ones on top of green bean casserole).  I said I wanted it all, and I think I only got garlic and onions.  But those are great.  Too many crispy onions.  See my picture.

After the hassle of ordering, and they were very nice through all that, you get your poke bowl.  It was tasty?  If you've had poke before this is just a normal poke place, not super fresh and amazing and fancy but still fine.  If you haven't had it before I suggest you try it, if only for the experience.

This is how they could increase stars: have suggested bowls!  Like \"salmon+tuna+onion+house sauce + garlic\" or something.  Name them after the employees or cool customers.  It's too overwhelming as is."}
{"text":"While their grand opening half off special was a nice surprise and their customer service is friendly...their fish doesn't impress. When you're a stones throw from Pisces you better bring the fish game and the puny scallops and rubbery octopus left a bad taste in my mouth. The salmon was pretty bland without sauce - I see why they push the sauce so hard!

I love this concept and the location but there is better quality in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Poke Bar & it was incredible! Delicious food and the girls were very friendly and helpful. I ordered the small with spicy tuna & Hawaiian tuna. Both were amazing & good portions. I definitely will be going back!

***UPDATE
Since eating here the first time, I have been to 3 other poke places very similar. Poke Bar is by far the BEST. All of the other ones I have been to do not have any sauces with any type of vinegar in them and I find they're bowls lacking in flavor no matter how many things you add. Poke Bar's Hawaiian Tuna is amazing & the spicy house sauce is the best! Love this place! Definitely my favorite"}
{"text":"So bomb!!! $12 for ahi, salmon and avocado such a great deal. Not gonna lie it's a little confusing trying to make your own bowl from what they have but what I came up with was AMAZING!!!!

Tied best lunch with Revolu around arrowhead, for sure."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever tried poke but I love sushi and I was hungry and happened to be wandering by and thought I'd stop in and give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I think this place is going to be my new go-to for healthy in a hurry.  The portions are huge (the medium bowl was more than enough to fill me up) and the food is so tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is the best Poke is Arizona hands down!! I am writing another review on this new one because I received the same quality, same experience, same rest service as I did from the North Scottsdale location on Shea. This is absolutely key when having multiple locations that some other restaurants completely miss, but not PokeBar. I do like the space they built out on and a super open concept. 

They deserve another round of applause for their opening and continued consistent delivery and execution of their product. The staff was happy the customers were  all smiles when I went in and it's good too see the growth in the valley.

This is a very simple, but yet clean and well thought out business model and they have an amazing product. The Poke is always fresh, it's nicely displayed and I get whatever I want on it and mixed in it. Congrats on your new location and you have a customer for life. 

No matter where I am in the valley and I'm craving Poke I'm going here."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, healthy selection.  Love all the flavors!  I will definitely be adding this choice to my regular diet!  Convenient, clean with helpful courteous staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and awesome employees... highly recommend!! My wife and I stopped in recently and I've been back twice since"}
{"text":"Employees were friendly and fast. It was my first time going here a few days ago and everything I had was fresh. Kinda wish I had more rice because I ended up having to ration it out so I could thoroughly enjoy my 2 scoops of tuna and salmon. It was a lot of fish which was good. Will definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"This place has been open for 9 days and has it together pretty well! During my 30 minute meal, there were about 10 people that came in during the later lunch hour (after 1pm), which means people wanted some poke in this area! There is another poke place nearby that I frequent, but this place has more fish options than they do, and they cost about the same. There is a place that does a poke bowl lunch special really close by, that can't be beat. I'm not sure I like it better than my regular place, but this is closer to home, so we'll see! It's definitely not off of my list!"}
{"text":"I've never had so much sushi in one bowl and so many options! Scallops, salmon, tuna, masago, and so many add ins. I am so excited to have this place near my house. Pictures to follow"}
{"text":"This place is legit amazing! I had been wanting to try this so on my way to work I got it to go. They have different sizes. I got the small. As you can see it's still a decent size. I got my pick of rice or I think the other option was greens. I got rice. You can pick two proteins. So I got scallops and salmon. I could pick any toppings. So I got edamame, green onions, and cilantro. I also got seaweed salad and crab salad. It was so yummy and refreshing. The pricing is decent too. I will definitely be coming back here. What I really enjoyed about this place is they could tell I had never been and they explained everything nicely and they have good protein choices. One poke place I have been to only has tuna and salmon. But here they had both and scallops and shrimp and I think more. They just had a lot to choose from and. I was very pleased. Oh they also have sauces. I think I asked them which one they recommended I get and I let them pick. It was their house sauce I believe! Definitely try this place if you like poke bowls. This place is my new crave!"}
{"text":"This PLACE IS THE CHIPOTLE OF SUSHI! a poke bowl is basically raw or cooked fish, rice, and lots of toppings. Much better than Charlotte sushi! Most sushi places hook you up with very little fish/protein and a ton of rice. Poke bowls are the next level. Choose your protein size up to 8 oz and 4 different kinds. I went with spicy tuna, tuna, salmon, and octopus. I highly recommend the tuna and spicy tuna. Texture and flavor were top class. Octopus was rubbery and salmon was mostly flavorless. Must try. A little on the pricy side. I went on a half price day. Usually the large is  around 12.95. Small is 8.95 and medium 10.95."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week since it's in a convenient area near my school. Hands down the BEST POKE IN AZ! Everything is fresh, rice is not dry, and scoops are def on point.  Poke Bar scoops are massive (usually..) I think it depends on who you get serving but the majority def over scoop instead of topping it off like other poke spots in AZ.. and that is why this place is the best. This place is unique for their variety of sauces.  I like getting the spicy house with light spicy mayo and then get spicy house on the side to dip my fish in. I usually order half and half (spring mix and white rice) w/3 scoops of fish which include salmon, spicy tuna, and their house made tuna w/their own seasoning. Their mix ins are UNLIMITED, which is a plus! Come try this spot out if you are down for some fresh, healthy, YUMMY food."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!! I have eaten here three times and each time is delicious. I get the medium with brown rice, wasabi tuna (which is amaaaazing), corn, edamame, cilantro, green onions, the orange fish eggs, spicy mayo and ponzu, avocado, and crispy onions. It's always delicious and fresh! The restaurant itself is very modern and pleasant. Everything is very clean and the people working on very helpful: they will guide you on how to order. The only downside is it is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and environment. If you want fresh fish this places is amazing. Now I have a poke spot to go to on both sides of phoenix."}
{"text":"First time here but it won't be my last!
The fish was fresh, delicious and flavorful. I tried the Hawaiian Tuna, Spicy Albacore, and Salmon. All were wonderful. The house sauce is super tasty and the topping options are pretty good. If you like pineapple, I recommend getting it if you choose a spicy protein. Sweet and spicy just go so well!!! I also love how they give you warm rice. Mixing it with the cold fish just does something amazing.
Even my 5 year old approved of everything. 
The only thing I didn't like is that they charge you $1 for a few small slices of avocado. For $1 I can go to the store and get at least 4 whole avocados. The price gouging on those isn't cool."}
{"text":"This is my first time having poke and this place was absolutely delicious! I had the hawaiian tuna, salmon, white rice with sides of seaweed salad and imitation crab. I also tried their macaron ice cream. OMG. WHERE HAVE I BEEN ALL THIS TIME. It was so good! I tried the coffee and the green tea. I haven't tried the other flavors but green tea was definitely my fave. I recommend this place to anyone who want to try something new!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, and delectable! This poke joint is over priced in comparison to sushi at Frys or Ahi Poke Bowl. Furthermore, I was disappointed that I got two tiny scoops of salmon for my small bowl, so I asked for another scoop, only to be let down! The cashier informed me I would need a bigger bowl to increase my salmon scoop :(. I asked if I could pay a dollar or two more for a scoop, like at Ahi Poke Bowl, but was again sadden by the cashiers answer, No! This business has a lot of potential, but is way over priced for the quantity given.

Nonetheless, the food was delicious and the service was friendly. I will not be going there once a week $$$ for lunch, but I will let my friends know about this joint!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is absolutely delicious. Hands down, best poke/sushi burrito place I've been to (including Chicago and NYC). The salmon melts in your mouth and is super fresh, and the Hawaiian tuna is deliciously marinaded.

If you are between getting sushi and this, this is such a better deal! More fish, probably fresher than your sushi joint, lots of veggies, and at $14 for a Large portion, you will be stuffed. 

They have a funny/complicated system for veggies and \"sides\", which I was super confused by, but basically it's whatever you want. 

Must go if you love seafood! They will even let you try the different options :)

Please come to Rapid City!"}
{"text":"Delicious, everything tasted very fresh, the staff was very friendly and helped me pick out different combos, great price for lots of food."}
{"text":"So granted it was grand opening day and almost closing time...I was glad it was half off. The rice was undercooked and the shrimp was overcooked. All of the fish was cut super small and not very flavorful. They were out of seaweed and crab..which is imatiation."}
{"text":"O.M.G!!!! This place totally brings me back to Hawaii! The flavors and fish are so fresh and so delicious. It's too good not to be against the law. I can not rave about this place enough, I'm so glad I stumble upon this spot today. Very lucky me!!! They will be seeing a lot of me in there."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. It's about time we got a Poké bar on the west side of town. I hate driving to central Phoenix and Scottsdale to get this divine thing we know as poke. 

I've been here about 5 or more times now in the past three weeks, so one might say I'm obsessed. It's a perfect meal after workouts because it's filling but not dense. It's also fresh and cold so it's great during the summer. 

The place is similar to Ahipoke and all the other poke bars. You first choose if you want rice or greens or both, then comes the favorite part of choosing which proteins. I usually get the Hawaiian poke tuna, salmon, spicy yellowtail, and spicy tuna. Then I usually cover it in some spicy Sriracha or wasabi cream sauce along with a sweet or Ponzu sauce. Next, comes the toppings.. Edamame, red onion, cilantro.. endless possibilities. Don't forget the \"crab\" meat (like a deconstructed Cali roll) and seaweed salad. Sorry folks, avocado is extra but it's one of my necessities. Top it all off with dried onion, sesame seeds and some ginger. Voilá! You just created one of my bowls!

But don't take my word for it. It's your choice, because you can also sometimes get spicy scallops and tako (aka Octopus - which sometimes has a chewy-ish texture so they cut it into small bits). 

Don't forget to get a punch card because you are rewarded for each poke bowl you get after so many visits. See you there!!"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh but it was the staff left me with a bitter taste. The avocado was black, but $1 extra. For that price you'd expect a fresh avocado. The place was empty. The manager took my order but could not comprehend the concept of doing no rice and having one of my 'side' items as my 'base'. He kept telling my he would have to charge extra for putting the seaweed in first. This is the manager? Then he passed me down the line and the next person screwed up my order by putting the dressing is asked for on the side right into the bowl. To top it off, there was no adult supervision. Apparently \"Hanna\" had better things to do than worry about serving a quality product."}
{"text":"A fresh dining experience if you already tried everything else. Get the 3 meat deal if you want more than enough for yourself. Also had to get another scoop of rice because one scoop didn't seem enough. Place is clean and staff knowledgeable of the choices available. Had an issue they did not have any boosters or high chairs for your little one. So I would have to suggest they change that soon since parents eat out too."}
{"text":"Kinda skimpy for a large with 4 proteins, when I walked in I knew it was kinda getting busy but it just seemed like even the staff was on in a bad mood  I don't like to leave rude reviews but please leave your problems at the door and don't let that affect how the food is prepared...I asked for 2 crabmeat salad sides and to me in all honest it looks like I was given 1 and small shy scoop usually this place is great on their portions but I can't say the same today"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. First off, it is really clean. It's bright, very well kept. The stainless and dark gray compliment each other. This is my second time going. The first time, David assisted me. I was nervous at first a little overwhelmed. And he immediately made me feel comfortable by his willingness to explain things to me. 
Food is fresh and healthy. I get the small bowl brown rice and spring mix ( half and half) spicy tuna and shrimp ( half and half) with cilantro, cucumber, edamame corn, house dressing with a side of crab salad and cucumber salad with crunchy topping. And the macaron green tea ice cream is the best! 

This is 10minites from my house. This place is Da BOMB !"}
{"text":"Hands down best poke bowl place in the west side area. The price for a large is 12.99 and gives you a generous amount of fish (4 scoops)!

Now if they also had miso soup, that would make it even better!!"}
{"text":"I go to the other location on Scottsdale Road often which is amazing. The amount of poke you get is ridiculously small compared to the other location. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from a fast food Poké restaurant, but Poké Bar did not disappoint. Friendly staff, and a great selection of ingredients to build your own dish. You choose your base, protein, sauce, toppings and mix-ins for a customized meal. There's different kinds of raw fish to include tuna, salmon, octopus and even tofu for the plantbased diners. For the bases there's brown and white rice, kale noodles and more. Lots of good options for sauces and mix-ins too. Poké Bar has quick service and good portions. I'd definitely recommend this delicious spot as a great lunchtime or anytime dining spot."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best poke places I've had. I went to school in Hawaii so I'm used to the best of poke places, and Poke Bar is the only place on the mainland that comes close to the poke experience out there. They even have a \"Hawaiian tuna\" that is great!

The pricing isn't bad if you're aware of the normal pricing of poke, but either way it's worth it. AND you get a lot of food.

10/10 would recommend for anyone who's looking for a great poke experience!"}
{"text":"Great staff that fully answered all my questions and had great suggestions. Very pleased and happy to have this place in the area!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! Poke has made its way to the west side.  For those of you unfamiliar with this concept it's similar to Chipotle but better.  You pick your base, protien, veggies, sauce, and sides.  Although traditional poke is created with sashimi grade fish there are some cooked options.  This place is fresh and delicious.  They have a punch card but no Thai tea ."}
{"text":"Y'all. I've been twice in 48 hours. 

They're having their grand opening half off special, and I love me some poke. This place is clean, the food is fresh and you get sides included with your bowl. Win. Win. Win. 

I got the medium with 3 proteins and asked for only one scoop of brown rice (the medium comes with 1.5 scoops of rice). Everything was well portioned. The first review of this place should really have been a 5 star one, so much fresh selection! So many wonderful choices! Both of my bowls were less than $6 with the 50% opening special. 

I give them a little bit of slack too because it's opening days. It was a little hard to hear the people behind the counter because of how loud the restaurant itself is, maybe it's the music? Maybe it's the sound bouncing off the walls and floor? I just had to ask what they said a few times here and there. The staff is friendly, although they seemed easily distracted. But I can't blame them on opening day, there was a lot going on. 

*I'm also wondering what they do with the brown trays. Every order gets one, but then they serve it to you in the plastic bowl (which I'll probably keep and wash out for cheap Tupperware). Are they recycling them? You can compost cardboard! But I'll save that for another day conversation with a manager. Loved my experiences here so far!"}
{"text":"Ordered the large Poke bowl through Uber Eats. Food arrived prompt and fresh. My Poke bowl came with salmon and spicy tuna and many toppings. Sides such as seaweed and cucumber salad are complementary with bowl. Sides were tasty and selection is generous.  My only issue was the spicy tuna, as I found it to be too spicy for my taste, lol. If I was too order again I would go without the spicy tuna. Overall I give this place an A."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! The poke is fresh and delicious, and love all the toppings and add ins to make it a bowl!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Came here yesterday for half off for the soft opening, which is a fantastic deal haha. Long line moved relatively fast seeing as they had just opened! As someone who doesn't eat fish, a poke place seems like a weird place for me, but I'm reviewing based on the tofu here! They have quite a few options though. Lots of add-ins too, I liked that they had kale! I just got the house dressing but I wish I would've had something else that was creamy. House was pretty good though. I got a large which was huge, and affordable because it was half off, but otherwise would've been quite expensive! Overall good poke place and I would come back but I think I'll stick to my go-to poke spot with more affordable prices."}
{"text":"Yay!! Very happy to have a poke bowl place on the West side now. The service was nice, but most importantly...the food was great! I ordered large size mixed greens with Hawaiian tuna, scallops & tofu with house spicy salad dressing. It really hit the spot. Will for sure be a frequent customer"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for work and dinner to-go option as well. The poke concept has spread across AZ, but this place stands out from the crowd with its fresh ingredients (especially the fish), variety of options, and the huge portion for each bowl. The line moves fast, and they always try to stuff as much food as possible in my bowl. You can sit inside or at the patio. Chill place and great food. Love it!"}
{"text":"I seriously can eat here everyday!!! I just love the freshness of everything. They have a variety of different proteins and toppings that you. can add onto your salad or your half rice and half salad orders. You have a choice of getting the poke bowl with all salads or half salad and half rice, I always get mine full salad because I get too full with the rice. The portion is awesome. I usually get a medium and as good as it is, I sometime have a hard time finishing it because they really stuff the bowls up! The place is very nice and clean. They keep the A/C up so high that I got the chills being in there for more than 15 minutes, but it's a good thing they do because that helps the food to stay even more fresh. The pricing is very reasonable as well. We paid $28 even for two orders of the medium bowls along with two drinks. They even offer ice cream macarons here as well!! So give this place a try if you're up for some delicious poke freshness :))"}
{"text":"Finally! We have a quality, affordable, quick place to eat in Peoria. I am from southern California. My experience with seafood in Arizona has not been good. However, Poke Bar offers FRESH quality poke and has great options for sides (edamame, pineapple, green onions, cucumber, etc). I would recommend the Hawaiian tuna and regular salmon. They were very tasty. House sauce is great. I will be coming back all summer."}
{"text":"So many poke place in Phoenix now, mostly west coast style, not real Hawaiian style here but Poke Bar is my favorite chain by far.

I've been to a few other Poke Bar and they are always consistent including this store.

They used to have two sizes but now they have three sizes. 2 -4 scoops, 3 is too big but 2 seems not enough.

Service here was friendly and inside is clean. They have a new point system that they keep track by your phone number. I don't have to carry a point card but annoying to receive a text message from them about promotion"}
{"text":"Loved this place! 
So nice to have a healthy option for lunch and dinner so close to home! Lots of options for protein to fit your dietary needs.
Large portion sizes..Even for small size!
Staff super friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"AHH! I love this place and I wish I could move to Arizona just to be close to such an amazing place. Staff is super friendly and that can seriously make or break a place. The Poke places where I come from don't have different flavors of tuna but this places is great! I tried their Hawaiian Tuna  and Spicy Tuna and I am in loveeee. They also have Wasabi Tuna but I didn't have the chance to try that. The bowls are a pretty good size and portions are reasonable. I ended my lunch with their Macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches and that was also a bonus. I will definitely make the trip back once I travel out to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Just so good. So fresh. So many flavors and textures. It makes me so happy inside to eat here. The smallest dish is MORE than enough food for one, especially if you get rice instead of greens. Try the house dressing. Try it all. They let you sample anything you want. Reasonably priced, clean, simple, and fresh. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Finally a good Poke spot in the West Valley. Though this place is franchised across a few states on the West-coast, this one is a corporate store. It just opened and is likely not to disappoint Poke newbies.

Why go here:
The Cali craze has finally made its way to Phoenix. The Hawaiian style fresh fish bowl is simple to order here, the staff is friendly and it takes a lot faster to eat than sushi. The fish is fresh, they have about seven different \"proteins\" or raw, diced fish. Some are sauced up in traditional Poke fashion, others are left plain for you to season and dress as you wish.
The combos are endless and the toppings are more or less unlimited for the most part. First time customers could use some pre-designed bowls to cut the confusion out but it's all good. The staff is friendly enough to walk you through. It's fresh, it's fast, it's hip and happenin' and it's healthier than the average fast food chain.

Don't miss:
The Hawaiian tuna was superior as far as taste since it was already dressed up. The spicy albacore was also very well done. The \"as much as you want\" edamame and other fixins' are a good touch and make the price point almost justifiable. Their house dressing and the ponzu make a killer combo.

Tip: 
I find the price point literally 10% too high (for the West Valley). The middle size is your best value. I've tried med and large, the med seemed to be the most bang for your buck. 50% off for their soft opening 4/7-8 doesn't hurt! Get there!

Overall:
It's refreshing to have an experienced poke pusher around the West Valley. If it's your first time take your time and get help at the counter, get your bowl made right. You'll find Poke extremely addicting."}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious! Caution: the sweet chili sauce will sneak up on you! Make sure to get an ice cream macaroon to cool off your tongue"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and loved both experiences. The poke is fresh and they have a nice selection of toppings. The large size was very generously portioned and I could barely finish it on my own. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Oh so good...It's heaven sent to have a place like this open up in the area.  Let's hope more solid choices like this follow.  As much as I enjoy all kinds of food including chains, there's something to be said for fresh ingredients, with no frying.  The selection is pretty wide, and the flavors are very distinct.  I had to order the large so I can try multiple protein choices.  The albacore was just the right spicy,  and the original tuna is tasty.  The sauces are great too, and the unlimited fixins.  I tried the garlic toppings along with the seaweed, and the crunch they added to the whole dish was perfect.  It was very satisfying and felt fresh and healthier as a choice.  The staff was also very helpful and answered any questions you might have."}
{"text":"Great service, very quick, awesome food! Don't forget to sign up for the reward points!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this placed bases on the reviews and the fact it's poke.

It wasn't the worst, but it's far from the best. Seems a little skimpy for what you pay for. They seemed overstaffed for how empty it was, but the place was very clean, and they were at least helpful with reccomendations. 


The fish seemed fresh, but over all the price is a little high, which honestly is understandable in a place not near the ocean. 

This place will survive on being a novelty for a while,  but I don't see it lasting long."}

{"text":"Everything was great about this restaurant.  The service was super friendly and quick.  The food is FRESH FRESH FRESH.  All of it, from the greens to the fish.  Just perfect.  There are so many combinations of sides, fish and other toppings, and sauces that you will never run out of things to try.  The price isn't cheap but completely worth it.

There are also a couple of tables on the patio if you want to eat out doors.  The best part of that is watching people go buy and ask each other \"what the heck is that\" when they see the place.  I talked to a few people and told them they needed to try it.  The restaurant should give me free food to sit outside and recommend it, LOL..."}
{"text":"While in Hawaii we stumbled across poke and fell in love. A few weeks later we're home with a craving for poke and it's nowhere in sight. After trying the handful of so called \"poke\" places around the valley this place stood out as the closest thing to authentic Hawaiian poke. We now go there once a week!"}
{"text":"Love love love Poke Bar!! I'm a regular!! Nuff said! It's amazing, clean and everything is super fresh...I love it!"}
{"text":"I just got introduced to Poke last year but all the options were way East of me. Yesterday a friend posted about this place on Facebook and it turned out I was ready for an early dinner/late lunch after fasting for 18 hours for a blood test that didn't happen. Typical set up as other Poke places in how the dish gets put together. I didn't notice any off flavors and everything was fresh. First time I had gotten mine with rice, I think I prefer the all salad base. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Never had poke bowls before but this was really fresh and good.  Seems like you get a good amount of fresh food for the money."}
{"text":"You have no idea how excited I am to finally have a poke spot on the west side. I moved from the east valley as soon as all the new poke and ramen spots started opening up and have been making a far drive to satisfy my cravings. When I saw this place pop up on my yelp I jumped in my car as fast as I could! Luckily this place is right across the street from my apartments so I will be here all the time.

The restaurant itself is so cute and well decorated. It has a very clean atmosphere. The employees and manager/owner were super friendly and helpful. They have tons of fish to choose from and it all looked super fresh. I love that they let you put as much toppings as you could want for free. The small bowl gets two choices of fish and a scoop of rice and it was plenty for me. 

I ordered the Hawaiian tuna and the regular tuna with sesame oil and the house spicy sauce. I topped it with edamame, crispy onions, fried garlic, and dried seaweed. I also got a side of seaweed salad! Everything is so delicious, wouldn't change a thing about it. I recommended checking it out asap because it's 50% off for their soft opening! I hope this place does well because I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always very nice here.  One thing that drives me nuts about poke places is trying to figure out the menu.  This place is as easy as it gets.  If you have never had poke before, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a poke bar near us for quite a while after trying it in California. Very fresh and tasty, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I got the bowl and had white rice, Hawaiian tuna and spicy albacore, cucumber salad, pineapple, cilantro, edamame, jalapeño, crushed garlic and chili powder. The spicy tuna had a good kick to it but it was just right. Not too spicy! The cucumber salad was amazing!! It was very filling! All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful! The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing.  Everything was really clean.  Very impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday for the first time (6317) with my dad. It's amazing. Clean, modern interior, incredibly kind and helpful staff; who make it a joy to go there. The line moved quickly and everyone seemed happy. The prices I think are reasonable, lower then most poke places, my dad thought they were to high prices so to each their own. Both of us agreed the food was amazing, a small is enough for dinner and the unlimited toppings are a great value! Very happy I tried this place, will be back! Also the macaroon ice creams are so good and cute!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place, he would eat here everyday if he could afford to. It's pricy, but the portions are kinda worth it."}
{"text":"9/14/17-This place is amazing! It was my first time here and the staff was so nice and helpful! 
One girl suggested the Spicy Albacore as it's her personal favorite and I'm so glad she did-it's tender and the perfect amount of addictively spicy. 
They answered any questions I had while walking me through my order and letting me sample whatever peaked my curiosity. 
I just really enjoyed their personable service and since I work near by, they will definitely see me more often! ;)"}
{"text":"Good concept, decent fish, but not what I would consider Hawaiian style poke. You'll see others upset that it doesn't compare to poke in Hawaii, well duh, we're in the desert. Good place for quick, clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"So much yum. Had  my first real post partum meal from here after having my baby on the 18th. Husband picked it up and brought it back. Delish."}
{"text":"We tried it again and it was great! The staff was so friendly and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love it! Its My go to place for Vietnamese food. The customer service was on point! If I could have this food every bight I would with no hesitation."}
{"text":"Chipotle for sushi is the best way I can explain it.  It's just way better than chipotle! Fresh sushi, good veggies, great service.  My new favorite spot! I recommend the house spicy sauce on your sushi!"}
{"text":"Just left the Poke Bar it was delicious! The fresh fish is the best! Tuna and salmon is my choice with brown rice! 

Stop by and enjoy the fresh fish it's so refreshing!

Dylan you're the Best!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots. The large was HUGE, I'll probably get a small next time. Delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome service!   Good food.  Great price for what you get.  Way better than just going to a Sushi spot.  You get way more fish for the price.  The fish quality isn't any different that you would get from an AZ sushi spot.  Only reason I give it a 4 because I'm from the islands and nothing in AZ can compare."}
{"text":"There is so much hype on the mainland surrounding Hawaiian poke these days, but not every place can make it right. In Hawaii, large pieces of chunky tender fresh fish is by far the central ingredient in a poke bowl, followed by secondary ingredients such as sesame oil, shoyu, sea salt, limu, and sharp white onions. Keeping it simple, fresh, and cheap is the name of this game. On the mainland however, the poke I have seen so far are closer to a deconstructed rainbow roll, with skimpy tiny pieces of mediocre fish overwhelmed by lots of cheap fillers that you won't see in Hawaii. At Poke Bar, it was a case of self-fulfilling prophecy of low expectations.

Fortunately, Santi and I came to visit their Peoria location when they still had the 50% discount on all items. The basic concept here is to choose a base among a variation of rice, kale, or nacho, followed by the protein, support ingredients, dressing, more garnish, and a \"side.\" Nacho wasn't the most laughable part of the ordeal, but they also considered mango as a legitimate protein for those who wish to have poke without the fish. At regular prices, their small bowl costs $8.95, medium $10.95, and large $12.95.

I ordered the large Poke Bowl that came with white rice and 4 small scoops of fish (tuna, Hawaiian tuna, albacore, and salmon) to combine with red onions, green onions, jalapeno, masago, imitation crab, ponzu sauce, and sesame seeds. It was served in a small shallow tray with rice that was unseasoned. The fish was not very fresh due to the slimy texture and aftertaste, and the support ingredients were unable to bring out the sharp flavors to cut through the taste of the fish. The ponzu sauce was rather diluted, and the small amount of masago and imitation crab failed to make an impression. 

Santi had the medium Poke Bowl with brown rice, spring mix, 3 small scoops of fish (tuna and salmon), red and green onions, jalapeno, cucumber, masago, shichimi powder, imitation crab, and shoyu. It was again served in a shallow tray, but her servings of fish were noticeably more plentiful than mine. When I sampled it, the tuna and salmon were passable, but not very good. The taste of the shoyu was very weak, and there was nothing on the tray that brought all the textures and flavors together into focus. It wasn't clear whether I was eating a salad, a poke bowl, or a rice bowl. I would give this place a 1-star rating if I had to pay full price for these poke.

This location is still fairly new, as the small interior appeared modern and well lit. Interested diners should expect a fast-food protocol, where you line up to work with a server to assemble your poke bowl prior to seating. The atmosphere was welcoming, casual, and family friendly. My preference is still to go to Honolulu or Las Vegas to get my poke fix. Disappointed, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down best poke bar!!!  The fish was very fresh and all the components had amazing flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Everything is amazing. The Hawaiian tuna, salmon, scallops, octopus, shrimp, and sauces and toppings were fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Poké ever since I had it in Hawaii last summer and even though the style is a little different than traditional poké this place is still amazing! The flavor of the actual poké is amazing! Great selection of toppings and sauces as well! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yes FINALLY, a poke spot in the west valley! Food was fresh snd delicious. We ordered a little of everything and my favorite was the Hawaiian tuna. They have many options between rice, salad or nachos  Will definitely be frequenting this spot."}
{"text":"Outstandingly fresh ingredients and friendly service. It was my first time and they were so helpful and thorough about guiding me through the process. I will definitely be back multiple times to earn punches for a free bowl."}
{"text":"The tuna here is always quality and fresh as well as all the mix ins.  This is one of the VERY few places I eat on the west side they never disappoint.  Great staff great food thank you Poke Bar!!"}
{"text":"Got the large bowl with rice as the base then got Hawaiian poke, crab, octopus, and scallops then added some seaweed and avocado! The meat tasted good and fresh!"}
{"text":"I had to try this new place.  I ordered a Med Poke Bowl (3-Proteins: Spicy Tuna, Hawaiian Tuna & Scallop Salad). Small store front, but very clean and the folks putting it together were very nice. Other Poke spots has got competition, this place is worth trying!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place I've gone there about 4 or 5 times and it didn't open that long ago. All the ingredients are fresh and yummy! And the restaurant appears to be very very clean and contemporary. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!! We eat here Once a week. Everything is always so fresh and good. Staff is friendly and knows their stuff. You can sample anything before putting it in your bowl and they offer a frequent buyer card"}
{"text":"Having been to Hawaii several times and enjoying poke there I was so excited to try this place! Especially after all the great reviews. The Hawaiian poke here though visually* looks awesome the color and everything, but taste wise it didn't have much flavor at all. I was really surprised on that. It made me wonder where they got there fish from and if it was farm raised as well as if dye was added to give the fish that color....And the seaweed was so mushy and I love ordering seaweed at different places.

I ended up not being able to eat it all and tossing it, although I never waste food. So that was a bummer for me. I didn't feel too well afterwards either. 

The customer service was wonderful and I tipped them well. I'm just giving a review of my experience with regards to the food alone, that's all. Of course experience it for yourself if need be. You might like it."}
{"text":"Best new spot on the west side. Been here twice and not disappointed.  Medium w rice is a little heavy so be hungry!!  Wish they had a food truck!!"}
{"text":"Had no clue what to expect walking in. Great lunch option. Was like sushi in a bowl! The Coffee Mochi was good also."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to pick up a healthy bowl of rice, any choice of protein and all of the fixes!! The minute when I saw this place on yelp I hauled butt!! And was it sooo worth it!! Great vibe and so easy to order and to try something new!!!"}
{"text":"I tried a poke bowl for my first time here and now I'm addicted! I underestimated the spicy tuna but it was so good! All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the staff wad so nice and helpful! And you have to try the macaroon ice cream sandwich. I got the coffee and my friend got the mango and we both enjoyed it! This may be my lunch spot at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! So many options. So fresh and healthy! Nice,friendly staff. Ono! Great to have the option of spring mix salad versus rice. Hawaiian poke was SO good. Everything was tasty, right down to the crunchy toppings."}
{"text":"The poke concept is hitting Arizona in waves. 

By no means is this a true Hawaiian style poke, but more of a deconstructed version filled with options such as vegetables, fruit (mango as a protein choice?!?), nacho (what the what?!?), and Asian influenced dressings.

Basically, you follow steps 1-4 and you'll have your shallow tray quickly assembled by the staff. 

Step 1 - Select base and size (small 2 scoops $9, medium 3 scoops $11, large 4 scoops $13)
Step 2 - Select your protein
Step 3 - Select your mix-ins (unlimited, free) and flavor
Step 4 - Select your garnish and sides (unlimited except extra sides and avocado)

On my initial visit, I ordered the medium with brown rice and spring mix, and my choice of 3 scoops of protein (1 tuna, 2 salmon). The staff placed the fish into a stainless steel mixing bowl and added my mix-ins (red/green onion, jalapeños) and added a package of low sodium soy sauce. With a quick stir, she poured it on top of my green leafy vegetables and cucumbers. I asked to topped it off with masago, shichimi powder and a mini-scoop of the imitation crab meat. 

With my first bite of the tuna, I thought it was passable but the salmon was a little bit more disappointing. The salmon meat did not have a firm texture. In preparing my meal, I noticed the staff had a difficult time scooping it because it seemed excessively wet. 

The prices were slightly inflated compared to other poke places on the West Coast. There were bench and table sitting but majority of the diners took their meals to-go. The ice cream macarons ($3.50) look very appealing but decided to pass. 

My favorites continue to be Poki One N Half (San Diego) and Calipoke (OC) for this type of style, and would consider Poke Bar more like Poke Subpar."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby have tried the West Bell location and as soon as I saw the sign I asked that location if it was the same company. They told me yes so I have been waiting for the opening. Its the best thing ever I love this place and it's always filled with friendly staff. If you havent tried you need to."}
{"text":"First time here and it was FANTASTIC. The guy that greeted us was nice, helpful and checked in on us. We love sushi so this was a different way to try it and it hands down was AMAZING. We will be back again and look forward to seeing this company grow cause I know it will."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite place to get poke bowls. Ingredients are fresh and good. Ask for a sample and they'll let you try them before adding them to your bowl. Portions are big for the price you pay. They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"First time Poke. Delicious!  I'll be back. Helpful staff were able to patiently explain the many choices. The small bowl was amazingly filling. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome poke! Very fresh and cold. Hawaiian Tuna and Scallops rock! Definitely coming back to try more items!"}
{"text":"I'm literally always here. The girls upfront are awesome and the food always makes my heart happy."}
{"text":"FINALLY...a poke place that does not nickel-and-dime you in Charlotte! I've been to Poke Bar 4x now and it is my go-to place. The portions are generous, the food is fresh & the employees are nice & patient. I will be coming back at least once a week! So glad this place opened up.

I moved here from southern CA a year ago and was hoping poke shops would open up in Charlotte. A few sprung up in the past several months but they really limit the sides, toppings, mix-ins and even sauces. I was used to the generous portions from Pokeland & KreAsian in Thousand Oaks, CA where for ~$11 (tax included), it would take 2 meals to finish my poke bowl. WHAT?!

I was so disappointed when I visited my 1st Charlotte poke place on Pineville Matthews Rd. I was served a sad kid size portion and was still hungry afterwards. Another poke joint on South Street is good too but they limit sides & toppings. I mean come on...how much does corn, edemame, picked onions, etc. cost? Give your customers 1 serving of each thing you offer in the price. So, BIG kudos to Poke Bar for doing this."}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant. Food was eh. Rice and seaweed salad tasted odd. Didn't finish my meal. Probably won't be back. Gave it 3 stars for staff. Without staff 1 star. This is only my second poke place to try. And the first place is amazing."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!! If I could eat here every day I would lol! The food is always fresh and the service is great and fast. Try this place out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. this poke place made my day. Cuz I love me some good poke. It's a small place. I didn't expect much but they r nice and polite, and most importantly the food is good!! A+ from me. I'm definitely coming back. Especially cuz they even have a punch card system too"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. 
The employees were friendly. 
I am disappointed by the cost vs. taste ratio. 
I paid $14 it had very little taste. 
Disappointed and won't be back"}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place!  Super fresh, friendly service, and the food is incredibly flavorful and reasonably priced.  This is going to become a go-to place for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This place had everything on point. Fishes were fresh, toppings were delicious, and I love how they put the fish on the side of the rice instead of on top so the fish doesn't get warm. I strongly recommend trying their homemade Hawaiian tuna and cucumber salad! Customer service was also great! I'm definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"The food was comparable to other poke places I've been to.  If I was judging this place purely on the food i would give them a much better review.  I love poke and I am very happy a poke place opened up in this neighborhood.  The location was clean, the fish was fresh.  The guy at the counter even expressed how the raw fish and the warm rice have to separated in the plastic square bowl.  He said this is a food prep regulation because warm rice can raise the fish temperature and make it dangerous. I usually ask poke places to toss everything in the end.  I'm surprised that no other places have mentioned the same thing.  What about sushi its on rice?  What about sushi rolls.  Im glad he knows his food prep and health code.  I'm giving it three stars for one reason because it was such an obvious customer service miss.  My wife wanted some extra crab meet after we had paid for our order and sat down.  Basically a side of crab meat that other poke places we have been to have rung up no problem.  The response from the same gentleman that prepared our meal was they don't have that in the system.  Basically he apologized and said there is nothing he can do. There was another guy that was hanging in the back at a table that looked like he could own or manage the place.  He was not dressed in uniform but went in and out of the kitchen/back office area several times.  He might have missed my request and the learning opportunity.  I understand if you want to build a successful business you have to have a system in place.  In the hospitality business you should have a way arround the system to make the customer happy.  Of course within reason.  It was 1 hour from closing.  Give us the crab meat on the house or ring it up as something else similar in value.  I would have happily over paid for the crab meat to make my wife happy with the remainder of her meal."}
{"text":"So good! Granted, I have never been to Hawaii and so I have never had true a Hawaiian poke bowl, but I am still so happy it has come to AZ. I became a fan of poke bowl when I lived in CA but when I moved to AZ about 2 years ago I couldn't find a poke bowl restaurant so I have been very happy that it has gotten so popular here lately. So far, this is the closest poke bowl restaurant to me and so I had to try it right away. 

The fish was good, the selection of toppings is a little smaller than some of the other restaurants I have been to, but has tasted really good and fresh the 2 times I have gone so far. The price is a little steep, but it seems to be on par with other poke bowls restaurants I have been to. All in all, I am very happy this restaurant has opened and I will be going back."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here and it's just as fresh as the first! All their ingredients are always fresh  never stale. The cucumbers are crunchy, edamame never soggy, and the fish is always prepared perfectly! Their food is always so good and so filling! The staff is also very nice, which makes this place all the more inviting. The restaurant is very clean and it seems they maintain that very well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is great! So fresh and was absolutely delicious. West valley needed just a place like this, it really hits the mark."}
{"text":"Really good poke here!  I have been to a few different poke locations before and this one is up there with them all.  The fish was fresh and everything was flavorful.  Their macaroon ice cream sandwiches are super good too!  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for Poke in the Glendale/Peoria area that doesn't want to drive to Scottsdale or somewhere far in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Finally made it by the new Poke bowl across from my gym in North Scottsdale. Conveniently located right off N Scottsdale Rd and the 101. The offer 3 sizes, 2 protein is Small $8.95, 3 protein $10ish and 4 protein $12ish. $1 up charge for avocado. I opted for half brown rice and half spring mix as my base- they also offer white rice or nacho chips as a base. For protein, I went Hawaiian tuna and salmon. Topped with edamame, cucumbers, crispy onion, red onion, crab and seaweed salad. The location itself is very clean and well put together. They also have plenty of Sauce options- I went with their house, which is soy and ginger based- very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan! I ordered a small bowl - 1 scoop of rice with 2 proteins (tuna and salmon) and then added on all the toppings/sauces/crunchy things I would typically want in a sushi roll. Here's how I see it: for $9 I am getting close to two sushi rolls worth of food that tastes very similar with exactly what I want in each bite. For this reason alone, I feel like I am getting my money's worth. I don't need to eat my meal twice to feel it was worth it. I don't need to be rolled out of a place for feel it was worth it. I am getting plenty, it's fresh and delicious and it makes me want to come back again since I am not overeating. I will gladly pop back in before heading to Trader Joe's so that I don't buy the entire store."}
{"text":"The poke bowl ended up being a lot bigger than I thought. I've been to a poke place on Thomas I believe, and it's not as good as this one. If you're new to poke and you like sushi, try it out!"}
{"text":"Great idea to get people in to try the Poke bowls for 50% off, but I know it's hard to retain those expectations after that kind of deal. All said and done we ordered 2 larges and 1 to-go, and we weren't disappointed. The choices and selection are rather simple, but you do get to customize every single visit to try different combinations. There are more flavorful and different toppings at other local poke joints around town, but this place keeps it straight-forward and consistent, due to the chain status. 

Future visits will likely order only the medium size due to the decent value at that level."}
{"text":"The Poke-craze is in full effect! I tried Poke about 5 years ago while traveling in Kailua Kona, Hawaii and I immediately understood what all the local commotion was about. Since then, it's been making its way further into the mainland and sparked a fire among the foodie community. After a few ho-hum poke experiences, Poke Bar finally hit the nail on the head with their Poke. Great and authentic and definitely worth my 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"For the amount you pay for, it really isn't a lot of food. By far the smallest portion poke place I've ever been to. Food is okay but definitely the price is an issue. Place is clean and employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Good selection.  Friendly, patient staff that answered all my questions.  Will definately return!"}
{"text":"This was my first opportunity to visit the latest poké place that's popped up in/around Charlotte and this is hands-down, the best I've had. I ordered the medium (2 scoops of rice + 3 proteins/fish servings). I subbed out the rice for mixed greens and loved how customizable the process went from there. The fish was fresh, the sauces were delicious (loved the \"suggested combos\" and agree with previous feedback that the spicy mayo packs some tasty heat). The addition of complimentary add-ins (green onion, ginger, cucumber, jalapeño, etc.) and sides (cucumber salad and seaweed salad) made my lunch perfect. I payed $1 extra for the avocado and the portion and quality was well worth it! So happy you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My first time walking into this super clean and modern spot I was warmly greeted by the nicest associate, Marquis! He walked me through the menu, my option and even his favorite picks! He was so helpful and so friendly! The poke bowl was also amazing :)"}
{"text":"Fish servings are about 2 oz each so don't expect more than half a cup of poke for the small bowl. Ingredients we're fresh but the rice was poorly cooked, it was somewhat on the overcooked side. Overall it was good enough for poke style but it's not memorable. Plus there were several fruit flies that greeted me when I visited the bathroom."}
{"text":"So excited to have a poke place close to home! I recently moved here from southern California where poke places are a plenty and have been craving it for months because well, Scottsdale is kinda out of the way. Anyways, i stopped by for the first time today and it was a great experience! Chipotle style poke place with fresh fish and friendly servers. I had the Hawaiian tuna, salmon and spicy albacore, all were delicious.i loved the different toppings that came with it as well. All in all a yummy experience and I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great variety and quality! Decent prices. Friendly staff.  A bit spicy for my taste but that seems to be typical of a lot of poke places."}
{"text":"Extremely fresh ingredients, extremely clean, delicious, and amazing customer service! A few of the servers are also from Guam! What a great place to connect island culture.

Each one of the servers are wearing gloves, so far have changed them when something comes in to contact with their station. (Poke station consists of meats, vegetables, and pickled sides and fish eggs)  They are also wearing hats and wipe down their stations after every service. 

Easy pay, they also included military discounts and flexible with customizations. (Putting onions or sauce on the side....etc) Punch cards are also included. This is our first visit and we just need 4 more stamps! 

The place is extremely clean. Very organized and inviting. Everything is up to date including menus and clean restrooms. Music is modern and current and booths plus chair seating is available within the poke bar restaurant. 

Overall, my family and I will be back to this Hawaiian poke bar. They have a plethora of options I can't wait to try. 

My husband and I are from the islands so this is pretty much a home away from home for the both of us. I've included some pictures for references."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing and so nice. It was super fresh and delicious. I will be back and I will spread the news of course. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food taste fresh and the price is right! My 10 y.o. Son and I ended up eating her on one of our mother n' son dates. The staff was friendly and made recommendations on what we should try. The fish was fresh and my Poké bowl was awesome. I have been back here at least 3 more times, and we will continue to frequent this location."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for some good Poké! This place nailed it. The infredients were very good, the sauces paired very well. Great selection of toppings. Also the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean!"}
{"text":"Finally I have conquered the Poke' bar! 
The location is nestled in a shopping center and kinda easy to miss. 
Walking inside I was little nervous because I'm not a huge fan of sushi or raw seafood overall. But the menu was so easy to read and the step by step was great! 

I decided to go with the small portion which comes your choice of brown or white rice or spring mix and with 2 choices of protein. I got the shrimp and Hawaiian tuna mix and white rice. 

For the toppings I got all the toppings except the jalapeños. So the pineapple, green/ red onions, dried onions, dried garlic, edamame, kale, corn, Cucumber salad with crab meat. Then you get your choice of dressing, spicy mayo etc. I got the house dressing. 

So for my first time ordering and trying Poke, it was great and I loved it! Definitely eat it again"}
{"text":"Treats their employees like slaves, portions are small, and even saw somebody chewing tobacco in the back. Never going back."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST! I'm absolutely obsessed. I got a medium bowl and it was divine! I've already been twice this week! I'm so excited there is a poke place in Glendale now. Everyone that is complaining that the portions aren't big enough is so wrong. It's a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"So far this is my third experience with poke. This place was different than where ive normally gone so I decided to try it. Upon entering, you are warmly greeted by the staff behind the counter. There was no line which was nice. A few people inside sitting and having a good time. So it was a pleasant atmosphere. For the portion size you get, the price is exceptionally reasonable. Food was great! Probably not so great of an idea for myself with having a dang cold stone next door. Lol. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Will be back!  Went in on Sunday 2/18/18 around 12.  While I loved my medium portion that came to around $14 my greeting was unpleasant.  The young gal with a full face of cute and colorful makeup was pretty rude.  It was my first time so when I asked how it works with the sizes she cut me off and spoke loudly about the scoops.  I asked to see the sizes and she was just loud and repeated herself in a condescending way and overall she was just not into her job and she made me feel unwelcome.  She gave me my proteins and passed me in to the next step and that girl was super sweet.  I loved everything about the entire to go bowl.  So I look forward to coming back but hope the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this place to open.  Been there 4 times in 6 days.   Everything is super fresh.   People super friendly...   Been to several poke places .. this is A1."}
{"text":"When my friends come to town, their always in need of Poke. This place was fast, fresh and just what I expect of a Poke place. We'd been eating like crap all weekend, so it was a nice change of pace to have healthy food finally. 

Plenty of options, and fresh toppings. And the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I live in Phoenix, so I'm used to awesome. So, when I am in the neighborhood again and in need of Poke, I'll stop by. You should too!"}
{"text":"So good, so many options, I made my base half brown rice and half salad, so freaking bomb!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times and always receive great service and delicious poke bowls! Great option for a fast and fresh meal. The portions are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I wish they had more these back where I live.  The place is just small enough to where you can get exactly what you want if you like raw fish. You can create your own tuna salad made the Hawaiian way or any other way you like. They even have traditional Hawaiian canned drinks and mochi ice cream.  If the franchise owners are listening you should create one of these in the  San Francisco Bay area downtown Oakland to be specific on Broadway"}
{"text":"I got spring mix instead of brown rice. The medium sized bowl comes with three protein choices. I opted for double seaweed salad for my two sides. The seaweed salad is the best thing here IMO. The staff are always friendly & they never skimp on any contents of the bowl."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the customer service was great. The portions are generous for the price. My husband and I usually go out to sushi and easily spend $75-100 for the two of us. We can eat here for under $30 and leave beyond full. We will definitely be repeat guests, also thought the punch card was nice."}
{"text":"This is probably the best poke bowl place in the valley! The have great quality of ingredients for a reasonable price! The staff is super friendly as well, and very quick. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Fresh, great quality. I am always pleased every time i come here. Great healthy meal whether you stay in or take it home. So happy they opened so close to my home."}
{"text":"Delish!! Friendly staff and very clean. They let us sample the different style tunas. My son & I got a medium bowl with spicy tuna, wasabi tuna, and their most popular Hawaiian tuna (amazing!) we had the sides with spicy mayo and almost all the veggies. We loved it and it was plenty to share though I think we agreed that we could easily eat it all to ourselves. Decor & location were also nice, located directly off 101 freeway."}
{"text":"So far the best poki in Arizona- I have tried two other places and so far this one is the best. Love the sauce choices! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I think it may be my go to Poke Bar!!! The ingredients are always fresh and flavorful so I don't think you can go wrong. The employees are friendly and patient, even when dealing with my indecisive self. If you live in the area and love Poke it's a place to check out."}
{"text":"I love this poke spot. Since I've stared coming here I go at least once a week and they have a loyalty card of buy 10 bowls and get 1 medium (3 scoop protein) free. I get something new every time and it always turns out good. Extra sesame sauce and poke sauce on my rice is always a must. I have not yet been disappointed by the quality of raw fish but I'm no expert. The fish has never been slimy, mushy, or to fishy tasting. The staff has always been very pleasant. The place is always clean with modern vibe inside. I recommend the scallops too, took me awhile to try and wish I had not of waited so long."}
{"text":"By far my favorite poke place in phx.  They have one by my work and just opened the one on Mayo by my house, I'm sooo happy!!! Love this place.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  My favorite is the small bowl with brown rice and mixed greens with Hawaiian Tuna and salmon with seaweed and crabmeat salads, house dressing and spicy mayo with all toppings that are green in color.  

The only thing I didn't like was that that they converted my rewards from the punch card to a reward point system.  I get less points for my money now.   I was on my 8th bowl almost had earned a new bowl and got a drink instead now."}
{"text":"I love that poke is popping up all over Charlotte now. My husband and I stopped by one day when we were in the area. Overall, we both really enjoyed it. I would say it's pretty comparable to the other options I've had around town. 

I think the topping selection is a little more limited than Seoul Poke Bowl.  I do think they had the most expansive protein options that I've seen though.  The quality is good, the serving size was good, the staff was incredibly nice and friendly. 

It's done Chipotle style and we had no wait when we were there. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My first poke experience and it was a good one.

I went during the first couple of days they opened for 50% off food. I work within walking distance, so I was excited to check it out. There was a line but the staff was doing a good job of moving the line quickly and being patient. Staff was very friendly and helpful!

I ended up getting the medium Bowl which includes three proteins and one and a half scoops of rice. I was able to eat on this for a second meal, so I do think it's worth the price.

My only real issue with the place is how small the portions are on the proteins. The protein was good, but it was chopped in a very small pieces rather than large cut pieces.

I enjoyed how spicy the tuna was and loved getting to add plenty of jalapenos for spice. Sauces were good as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Food is delicious , service was A+, clean restaurant and reasonably priced.  I am a fan !!"}
{"text":"Last week I dropped in for a poke fix and was excited to finish the last three stamps on my card. The girl asked me register for their new app program. I questioned her to make sure I wouldn't lose my free large poke. She assured me I wouldn't. When I went in this week I ordered 2 smalls, and when I got to the front counter the machine said I earned a large poke! And it expired today! I asked if I could count my small as the free and was told no. I asked what they could do and the gentleman told me nothing. Love the food, hated the service! Poke bar, was it worth one poke bowl to lose the customer? Train your employees in problem solving!"}
{"text":"A really yummy place. It's not too ridiculous in price, and they have great ingredients you can add to the poke bowl. Fresh and yummy. The servers are always great."}
{"text":"Not a raw fish fan but they have delicious tofu and cooked shrimp for the wimpy set (me).  I loved my poke bowl! French macaroon ice cream sandwiches are too sweet but kids will love them."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. All I have to say is Protein. Amazing service and food. New favorite place"}
{"text":"I am beyond happy that this Poke bar opened near my house. I could eat here every day. The food is so fresh and tasty. The restaurant is spotless and they hired people with smiles and personalities. I can get a healthy delicious meal for about $10. What's not to love. Please go check out this great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"By far the best poke place in AZ! I've been to 5+ places throughout Scottsdale and the valley. Seems like a new one is popping up on every corner!

But none of them are great, just mediocre. The Poke Bar definitely has not only the best price but the biggest portions of EVERYTHING. 

Definitely will be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh, delicious poke. The house sauce is great, and I love how you can customize your bowl. I go out of my way just to eat here."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! I have to stop if I'm near by. Everything tastes so fresh. My favorite guilt free lunch!"}
{"text":"Poke Bar is pretty new, taking the place of the Starbucks that used to be in this plaza across from Whole Foods. It's pretty similar to other poke places: you choose your size (2, 3, or 4 scoops of fish), and your base (white rice, brown rice, salad or tortilla chips) and then you add mix-ins and toppings. I've tried the Hawaiian style tuna, spicy albacore, and scallops so far. The fish is okay but I don't think it is as fresh as the stuff at Poke Spot in the Greyhawk shopping plaza. The Hawaiian style tuna is pre marinated and had kind of a grocery store texture to it. I also found the rice on the harder side but for a quick poke lunch, this place is a welcome addition to the rotation."}
{"text":"Was at the car dealer and decided to try this place since I'm really trying to expand my Poke horizons and heard it was one of the good ones. I'm not sure why I keep doing this though because I keep ending up being disappointed, or in this case, underwhelmed compared to my current go to place. It's not that it's bad...it's not bad. It's just okay. It was empty at dinner time which was a bit strange too. Fish was pretty fresh but not super fresh. Rice was average. Sauce was okay. I give it 3.2657 stars."}
{"text":"Very unique food for sure and very impressive ! They have a step by step how to order menu that helped out being my first time there and the young lady helped me with what was popular. My experience was great as far as how the food tasted, it kept my tast buds very busy with all the flavors ! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened up by me. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I have a gluten allergy, and they were able to accommodate me with no issues.  They even have gluten free soy sauce!  I got a medium bowl with salmon and shrimp, mixed with white rice and spring mix.  Holy moly was this good!  Everything was super fresh, and I loved that they have furikake, seaweed and cucumber salad, and my favorite Japanese green tea.  It's so nice to have a fast, fresh, healthy place nearby.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I don't know why but I was expecting little variation from their scottsdale location, but it was the same. Very friendly employees eager to help you put together your poke bowl. I took a photo but it looks very similar to another one I took of their other location. The taste was equally good, so if you're in the area, definitely stop by and grab some food. They also have loyalty card but you can't use your card from Scottsdale one."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm. Mmmmmm. Mmmmmm. Went with my daughter and it's now a fave place.  We try to be healthy so we loved that you can get greens as your base.  The hard part was deciding on which protein.  The octopus and house sauce was amazing, but as a spicy tuna girl, i had to go with the spicy seared rare albacore and the raw tuna with house sauce.  Not sure what to get...?...they happily give samples... the service was great.  The ingredients are fresh.  It was incredibly tasty.  We didn't have dessert but i can totally see someone breaking in after hours and putting that freezer full of macaron ice cream sandwiches in the back of their pick up truck and taking off with it... they looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Look - I get that Poke Bar isn't a roadside stand on the North Shore that plucks its fish from the warm Pacific surf - no illusions there. Poke is street food, and like most street food, it's pull is that it is cheap and fast AND tasty, and Poke Bar nails those aspects. 

My order is usually the half rice/half greens bed with 3 types of fish for around $13, avocado & a drink is more, but I usually pull the trigger on that too. You can get out of here for under $10 and still have good flavors. The key is to get numerous textures - creamy avocado and dressing, fresh crispy greens, the pop of the fresh fish and rice, and the crunch of the wonton chips and masago. It's the flavors of sushi without the price tag - a solid lunch, and filling, but not in an \"I need an afternoon nap\" kinda way. Happy to have Poke Bar around!"}
{"text":"I only am updating because the owner reached out and went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of. Its owners like that, that make a difference.

5.28.18

Gave this place another try. I asked for some seaweed seasoning after they loaded up protein apparently that was to much work and I was told I will get dry seasoning at the end.

I know I get dry seasoning at the end but I wanted seasoning on the protein but oh well.

And then when the added my sides it was a small pinch of cucumber salad....not sure what's going on with place but I'm not returning."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Hawaii.  We were super excited to try it out and sad to say it did not meet our expectations.  Nothing like Hawaii.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Everytime we eat here there is seating available and clean tables. The staff are nice and courteous. The service is just what you need from a build your own sushi bowl. The meat and toppings taste fresh and great seasonings. It is great solution to sushi whithout the full sit down restaurant. I enjoy this style greatly and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"I have partaken here a few times. Each time the staff is friendly and the place is clean.

So you start at one end and choose your size based on scoops of protien. 2, 3, or 4 scoops of fish. White rice, brown rice, spring mix, or nacho chips. Mix ins and sauce. Then sides like cucumber salad and crab mix.

It's a make your own sushi bowl. All of what goes into a sushi roll opened into a bowl.

I do like it here. And enjoy coming back. Fresh and clean eating. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I had a great experience when I stopped here to grab a poke bowl. The fish and ingredients were delicious and fresh. The employees were incredibly friendly and helpful (they thought I had never tried poke but little did they know how much of it I've eaten hehe). If you've been to a poke place, you know the deal. You get either 2 or 3 scoops of a \"meat\" and then pick your rice and toppings. The food here was fresh and well-maintained. My only gripe was the price was a bit high compared to other poke places I've tried. If that's fixed, this would be a 5-star paradise."}
{"text":"Introduced to poke in Hawaii earlier this year and found it quite good.  Saw this place while doing a yelp search for poke a little closer to home.  While it wasn't quite the same, it was pretty good!  Tables were clean and staff was friendly.  I will do this again!"}
{"text":"my first time to a Poke restaurant. I wasn't sure what to do, but the guy and girl behind the counter were very patient and explained what everything was and how to order. I was a little skeptical of how everything would taste. When I had my order ready and started to dig in, O-M-G. I love sushi to begin with but, between the greens, the fish, the seasonings, the freshness- just all of it together created bursts of flavor in my mouth that satisfied my vegetarian cravings and desire for more! All for an amazing price! I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Never been here before and I must say I am gonna be a regular!!!!! So dang good!!! I got a spicy tuna with brown rice and cucumber salad which is so delicious!!! And one of my fave restaurants has macroon ice cream sandwiches and low and behold so do they!!! Staff are friendly, place is clean well stocked and food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's just okay. There are plenty of other places you can get a better bowl/experienc"}
{"text":"Poke / Salad Bars are poking up all over the US.  At least in the Western poke of the US.  For those unfamiliar with Poke, in simplest terms it is marinated raw fish, usually High Grade chunks of tuna, Sesame Oil, Ogo / Seaweed, Chili Pepper, and Hawaiian Sea Salt.  Some Poke connoisseurs like to add green onions, white onions, and sesame seeds to their home made poke.  Happy to say, Poke Bar starts out with fresh chunks of tuna and lets you build from that base with many options.

At PB, you have plenty of heathy options, starting with the size which ranges from two scoops (S) to four scoops (L) of protein (traditional Hawaiian, Spicy Tuna, Albacore, etc), rice or salad or a mix, sauce, toppings, and more toppings.  We liked that the crab salad is a topping and not a protein option as in some Poke Salad shops.

We went around 9pm, right at closing, and the two Poke Baristas (?), were pleasant even though we were probably delaying their close. Great service with no closing attitudes.  Oh yeah, they have Hawaiian Sun drinks with tropical flavors.  BTW a small is plenty of food...."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Haven't had poke since we were in Hawaii and this place exceeded our expectations. Delicious food, plenty of choices and friendly staff. We will definitely be coming here regularly!"}
{"text":"Love love love poke and this place didn't disappoint. Both my friend and I got the bowl with 3 proteins and the portions were great. I got the salmon, octopus and classic tuna poke. Pretty much added everything possible and topped it with spicy mayo. There are so many options and everything is super fresh and delicious. For the quality of food the prices are really decent too."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The protein options are so fresh, the veggies are crisp, and the staff isn't stingy!

My husband and I are moving out to Goodyear and we are so bummed that we will be leaving the best Poke around.

If you've never had Poke before, definitely try it here first. The staff is patient, you can sample a small piece of a few proteins if you've never had them before, and there are so many options that it is hard to go wrong! My personal favorite proteins are the spicy tuna, scallops, and the albacore. If you've worried about consuming raw fish, don't worry! They offer cooked shrimp, Tamago (egg), and Tofu as options, too.

As far as take-out goes, this option is MUCH healthier for you, too! Add some kale, cucumbers, maybe some pineapple to your fresh protein, and you've got an easy, guilt-free dinner! And it's located conveniently nearby so much shopping that it's the obvious end to a day full of shopping."}
{"text":"Newly opened in the old Starbucks location off mayo and Scottsdale. Had Hawaiian tuna on spring mix. As about $14. Delicious. Super nice employees. I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"I went there 2 days in a row! Everything was fresh and delicious. My daughter loved the macaron ice cream sandwiches. The staff was also very nice."}
