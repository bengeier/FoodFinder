{"text":"Got there at 10am on National Donut Day, and they were closed because they were already OUT OF DONUTS. Way to plan ahead, guys."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Chicago and these donuts taste like something I would get back home!   I usually get chocolate long johns and my husband usually get a glazed and a plain, and they are all super yummy!   They are light and fluffy with the slightest crunch to them, and the glaze has just the right amount of sweetness.   I highly recommend these donuts to anyone, and my family is now hooked! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite donut shop! I also am in search of the best Boba drinks and their Taro and Passion Fruit Boba drink is amazing! If you haven't tried one, it is a \"Change your Life\" moment. I go every Friday morning for donuts and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a few donuts and OMG those donuts were AMAZING!!!!!!  We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Yayyyyy got my fix of boba today love this place Mango boba and Taro are awesome definitely recommend this place staff is so friendly"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town. Period!  The glazed chocolate cake donuts are by far my favorite but every donut I've had from there has been fantastic!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to pick up a couple dozen donuts for a customer of mine and little did I know these are \"the best donuts\". Major points for me! The service was great and the donuts were even better."}
{"text":"Fluffy krispy kreme like doughnuts!  Girl at the front counter is very nice. It was my first time trying boba and the staff is really helpful, I had sweet milk tea boba and it was DELICIOUS. Small little family owned  doughnut shop 10x better than Dunkin.  Will be a regular customer : )"}
{"text":"Finally, I get to write a Good review today!!! Yay!!!! So happy, I love, love, love when yelp allows me to find a GREAT new place and everything is just as great as I thought it would be!! This place is perfect, scrumptious treats and goodies for those days you're having a craving and super friendly people. I was there during a busy morning and I was short on time and a little concerned that I would need to wait for while,but not so, I was greeted, received my order and  was out the door in no time. Will be back to try out more of the menu, two big thumbs up!! :)"}
{"text":"Other reviewers already said all the good stuff, so all I can do is leave my 5-star rating.  Highlights: - Amazing customer service! - We went for the boba & were not disappointed.  (Best boba we've had and we've tried it in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Washington D.C & in France & Germany!)  The server experimented with a mixture of milk tea flavors for us & had us try a sample before making the final drink.  Additionally, we like the boba drink with less ice & more watery - the server asked us a few questions about it to ensure she made it just right.  The boba itself was perfectly textured & with just the right amount of sugar/honey. - Donuts were great as well! Will absolutely be going back often!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good donuts, awesome boba! Glad this place is open and everything I've had so far has been great! The customer service is excellent! I recommend the avocado boba. It's refreshing and delicious! Every Sunday is boba Sunday!"}
{"text":"Every Sunday morning I stop in and buy 6 old fashioned glazed donuts. 1 for right after my workouts for the next 6 days. I have lost over 150 pounds and yep... I eat a donut every single day!!   I prefer this place not only because the donuts are amazing but because they are family owned and use quality ingredients. Can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"OMG!! This family owned & run doughnut shop has the MOST delicious doughnuts. Our family never orders less than a dozen. Our favorites include the blueberry cake, the custard filled, their apple fritters & cinnamon rolls. When my in-laws visit from the east coast,  they make at least two trips there."}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed! I had the ham and cheese jalapeño croissant and got a half dozen donuts to go. The croissant was very good! Donuts are very tasty too. There are a few tables to seat at but most people just come and go. The staff is very friendly and the shop is really clean. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food! I'll definitely be back =) This may become my new Sunday morning habit!"}
{"text":"I started coming here every 2nd sunday of the month for a car meet held in the area, this is the hot spot for sure. The donuts are really great, can't image when its hot and fresh, probably blow my mind.  On the side, they have boba tea which is really good, my favorite is taro and will ALWAYS be my favorite flavor."}
{"text":"Moist, fresh yummy donuts.  Iced white chocolate mocha better than Dutch Bros Coffee.   Will never go anywhere else for donuts."}
{"text":"iv had alot of donuts in my life and these guys are something special, Every donut is delicious and soft, I don't eat donuts from any other place anymore...I'll be surprised if there not voted best in AZ by the New Times in 2013"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for the last 3 years and every time I stop by, the staff are always super nice and personable. They have great service and their boba is amazing and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with the friendliest service ever.  What a treat for Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Genuinely friendly and patient as I make my sections.   The doughnuts are amazing, so much better than any grocery stores. Supporting our local businesses is just another plus."}
{"text":"There is no other place on this side of town that comes close... seriously name another independent donut shop! Great service, better donuts... get the eclaire! Good coffee too... Discovered it two weeks ago and probably been there around six times... can't beat it, and its also a small business in which you can talk to the owners, and get to know the whole family... so go support them its a win/win except for your waist line!"}
{"text":"The donuts were pretty good, fluffy and soft, and the service was good, however the place has a bit of a shabby appearance. I wasn't too fond of the sweet tea, it was ultra strong and not very sweet."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Their doughnuts are great, coffee is great, milk tea is phenomenal and their staff is fantastic. Odds are it will be busy though. Eat here."}
{"text":"Mmmm...donuts. I work the night shift, so after a long 12 hour shift the last thing I feel like doing is going home and cooking breakfast. I wanted something different than McDonald's, Burger King, etc., so I Yelped for nearby donut shops totally expecting to find the normal chain restaurants. Thank God I found this one, because these donuts are seriously freaking awesome. The texture is perfect--light and fluffy. And the taste? Heavenly. I totally finished my two donuts (yes, two donuts, don't judge!) before I even reached my front door. At first I thought, \"Hmm, I'll just have a bite to see if these donuts live up to their reviews.\" Well, that quickly turned into \"Holy crap, how fast can I shovel these things in my mouth?!\" It was donut lovers nirvana. The price is amazing too. I think it was like $7.50 for a dozen, which is along the lines of the other donut places, grocery stores, etc.  I can't believe I've passed by this place so many times without even knowing it was here! So, yeah, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Express Donuts is the place for west valley residents. Their buttermilk bar is always fresh and always delicious. I've never had poor service, and I always recommend this place to anyone wanting a GUARANTEED delicious donut. Their blueberry donut is also pretty freakin' bomb. I'm not much for deviating from the classic buttermilk, but I haven't been disappointed every time I try something new. Express Donuts know their customers and know their donuts! Someone once told me Rainbow Donuts were the best in town...shame on you for feeding me those lies!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day and got the taro-coconut boba. The actual boba was good. It was soft and chewy, which is how I like my boba. The taro-coconut was blended and was grainy since they use the powder milk tea flavoring. The girl working the counter was very sweet and helpful. Overall, I enjoyed it and will try to visit again."}
{"text":"I love that they make boba drinks here! And that they are actually authentic milk teas. The boba is soft and really fresh too. I haven't tried the donuts, so I don't know if they are actually good or not...but they look good in the case and the prices (.79 for a regular donut) are good too!"}
{"text":"Bought assorted donuts and boba beverages at the end of the day, an hour before closing. Assuming the donuts were already a few hours old, they were still perfect. Soft and airy. The glaze wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and excessive. I would say they are on par with some of the established donut makers. The drinks with boba were an additional treat. Like their donuts, they don't drown you with excessive sugar or flavoring. I would recommend it to anyone that lives in the West Valley. I am withholding a star because their store needs a little aesthetic work. So come on and support this local donut shop!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts! Definitely way better than the chain store donuts. Very light and airy and not overly sweet or heavy. Prices are great too! Love this gem!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot - very friendly, great service! Good selection of donuts and a variety drinks."}
{"text":"everything here is great, the food and the service!! the blueberry cake donuts are my favorite, yum!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, the donuts were awesome, we will definitely be a customer for a lifetime  anytime we are in the area, and craving donuts."}
{"text":"I had given up donuts to watch my girlish figure - but to heck with that.  I will run a few more laps to be able to treat myself to these donuts.  They look like Fry's donuts, but when you eat them, they are like a sweet fluffy cloud.  So yummy!  The family who runs the place could not be nicer."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts I've ever had. And the service is even better. They are great people making great donuts. :)"}
{"text":"Crazy good. We go there all the time.  The people who run it are super nice and it's a family business."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town!!! Great service and I'm not kidding best donuts in town."}
{"text":"Consistently good customer service and donuts, never let down. Please keep up the good work, so hard to find a consistently good mom and pop shop. Thankfully it's in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley hands down! They don't compare to dunkins. I always come here when I'm in the area and There always fresh. Keep the donuts coming express"}
{"text":"My husband brought home the maple and chocolate eclair donuts. Let me tell you,when I bit into the maple eclair donut, it was like flavoring a soft sweet cloud of fluffiness. It was divine, superb. A slice of heaven right here on earth. The state of my being was euphoric. My 2 minute affair with this donut was intense. It was like no other donut I've ever had the pleasure of savoring. I've found my soul donut go to shop. Zowie."}
{"text":"This is the only place we get donuts. The owners and staff are super friendly and the donuts taste great."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has a line out the door on the weekends... awesome donuts! The apple fritter is definitely my favorite. They are even good a day later :) I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! Excited to find something on this side of town that's close by with real donuts (not gas station donuts). Staff was very friendly. A lot of reviews say they were out of donuts when they got there - they weren't out when I went but I stopped in early on my way to work  - I suggest getting there early so you don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Make sure you call this place first before attempting to go because most of the time they are out of something. Came today, open until 5, and they were out of donuts... Last time we came they were out of something else we wanted. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Good place for boba on a hot day ... the drinks are a little to sweet for me but they where good."}
{"text":"I came the other day and they were closed at 3pm because they ran out of donuts. Now that says something! So I tried again and this time there were some donuts left at Noon. No blueberry though and I really wanted some. The donuts are really soft and fresh tasting. I got a Taro boba smoothie that is really refreshing and sweet. Got my kids loving them too!"}
{"text":"The donuts are really good, 79 cents for a donut and a 1.29 for the bigger one. Nice soft, and good size. Right near my work. I will admit there is another bakery that I do love that ha s donuts and other breads there service is better...but the lady who served me today was nice at the end. I will come back especially since this one is closer."}
{"text":"Tasted like any old donut to me, not bad, not great. I would not drive all the way over to this place and pass Basha's and Fry's donuts as the was nothing special about these.  I would eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I came here on Yelp recommendations.  It was good!  I asked for a chocolate icing donut but got glazed.  Meh.  I guess she didn't understand me.  The glazed donut was just OK.  Nothing to write home about.  I also got the taro boba but w/o the boba.  Not bad.  Not great but passes muster for our side of town.  The ladies at the counter was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Boba and donuts..great combo. The donuts are awesome. Moist and delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE THE DONUTS THEY SERVE HERE. Having said that... I'm not happy with their prices and this might be unfair, but honestly, it's a simple donut.  I can't believe I paid almost a dollar for an average sized donut.  It's a great tasting donut, but come on!  I would have been just as happy with 2 donuts from Basha's or Fry's for that price.  I tried a boba smoothie.  Strawberry Mango: the boba was great, not one overcooker/ hard boba ball, but the smoothie was more mango than I expected. Mango overpowered the strawberry, it wasn't even a fair fight... Mango smoked Strawberry hands down.  Next time, I'll order a single flavor smoothie, instead of trying to get fancy-smanschie combo flavors."}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin tx. And looking for a good donut (not dunkin).   Express donut exceeded expectations with great service and delish donuts.  Apple fritters were the best we have had.  Next time we are back in Phoenix  we will be coming back."}
{"text":"They make great donuts here, and the service is excellent!  I once preordered a large amount of donuts, and they made them fresh minutes before my schedulers pick up time"}
{"text":"HOLY DELICIOUS DONUTS!! Even the plain glazed ones are yummy. I have never tried their boba drinks, but I hear they are highly recommended! They also have stuffed croissants that are offered in both sweet and savory. Get there early cause they make them fresh everyday and sometimes run out... OMG! How could I forget to advise you to get the BLUEBERRY CAKE donuts... one word: WOWSA!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh donuts! This place has the best blueberry cake donut and avocado boba! The staff is super nice and everything is always fresh."}
{"text":"I love the people that own/work in this shop. They are so kind and nice. The donuts are always perfectly fresh and just the like the kind I remember getting growing up in California. Super lucky they are right here in Goodyear. This is my son's favorite \"treat\" place to visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing place !!!! I love how they have a variety of smoothies and milk teas. Great customer service, very clean!!!! My favorite is the coconut milk tea with jelly and boba!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, FINALLY a good donut shop! I got a dozen donuts for $6 the other day. I think they are having some sort of special. Anyway, their donuts are SO good. I had a maple bar that was still warm, fresh from the oven. And the girl who helped me was super nice and friendly, which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"These are hands-down the best donuts in town. They are always fresh and soft! Never had the drinks so I can't speak to that, but this is a family favorite for when we are looking for a special treat."}
{"text":"Family owned and they are so friendly and their donuts are amazing!  Light and airy and not expensive at all.  They have great coffee also.  The croissant filled with ham, cheese and jalapeno is killer heated.  The diet goes RIGHT out the window when I open the door"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place. I woke up wanting doughnuts and coffee and  after searching yelp came upon this little gem. The customer service was GREAT. We had gotten a dozen of mixed doughnuts and I had asked for a blended thai tea. The cashier let me know it would be a minute for the tea because they had a line out the door.  That was fine with me so my little family and I grabbed a table and munched on what we hard already purchased..... mmmmm so light and fluffy and perfectly sweet. So good that my boyfriend had decided to purchase a second dozen. We also tried one of their ham and cheese croissants.  Still warm and gooey. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place....  Largest variety of donuts in the area.   Great space for breakfast...  Fast take out."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the west valley! On the weekend when I want a quick pastry this is one of my go to's.  There boba is great as well but go primarily for their donuts."}
{"text":"Love having a family run donut place on our side of town!  The owners are really friendly and the donuts are always good."}
{"text":"Probably the best doughnut shop in the valley. It is a nice, family owned business. All of the doughnuts are delicious, but I highly recommend the Bavarian cream. If you're a fan of boba, this is the place to get it too! Their boba is fresh, and they make the drinks as you order them. If you like \"weirder\" flavors, their avocado boba is delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy donuts, good prices, great service no complaints at all. Drink wise all I've ever ordered is plain black coffee and every times it's been fresh and hot. This is my family's go to donut place."}
{"text":"Great new little place that has opened up in Goodyear with very good Donuts, I really like their cake ones and their apple fritters too! Very friendly staff and is just getting started.  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally stopped after years of passing by. We got 12 donut holes for $1.29, croissant, and drinks. I wish I did not try the donut holes only because they are too good. I ate two and gave my husband the bag otherwise I would have easily consumed them all. The staff is also VERY nice and accommodating. We will make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Best donuts astound. Freshly baked every day! Very nice family runs the place."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh donuts with quite a few varieties. Their Boba drinks are ok but the bobas are tasty and soft. Cooked to perfection. I came here a few times for their drinks but found a newer and better boba place down the streets so I only come here for the donuts."}
{"text":"Amazing locally owned business with great service and even better donuts. This place is about 10 minutes away but we get up on saturday mornings just to get our fix. The donuts are just so fresh and soft tasting! Really is a must try in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Very, very good donuts.  If you're on a diet have just one... and when you start to feel guilty about it have another to remind yourself why it was all worth it."}
{"text":"My hubby found this little gem through yelp (Thanks!!), and as we discussed when to pay them a visit, we got to talk about how it reminded us of all the little donut places in CA.  When we finally went earlier today, and as they were getting ready to replenish more of the filled donuts (lemon, blueberry, raspberry, Bavarian, etc), we got to talk to the young lady helping us, she shared that it's a family owned and operated business, she's at the front counter, her cousin is the baker, and her mom is the owner/manager. They come from Long Beach (no wonder!), and we decided that these are the BEST donuts we have ever had before (including the ones in Cali), so soft and fluffy, and delicious. And they are so friendly, they make you feel very welcome!    We got a dozen of them, my kids enjoyed the classics chocolate with sprinkles, the glazed twisted, I had an orange glaze (yummy), lemon filled, apple fritter;  and there are a couple different ones waiting for us in our pink box. We also enjoyed a regular coffee and a Piña Colada Smoothie with Bobba, yummy!    If you find yourself in the West Valley craving for a good donut, make sure you head this way, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"National donut day so where do you go? Dunkin' Donuts? Yuck. Grocery store ? Dry and touched by 40 people before you even get there. Krispy Kreme no you gotta eat 8 of them. Hmmm QT yes tasty usually but again touched by 40. Ok let see what Yelp has.  Express donuts went in and clean, friendly and the donuts not Express but Heavenly Donuts.  WoW.  Fantastic and delicious ."}
{"text":"This place has been here in Goodyear for at least over a year now.  It is still just as good as it was when it opened. They are always the best, freshest donuts in town. I literally had a fresh out I the fryer maple long john that was amazing! They are always friendly and helpful and have great prices. I hope Goodyear residents continue to frequent this shop so it stays here for a long time! We recommend the maple long johns, buttermilk bars, an the chocolate glazed. But everything we have had has been fantastic! The Iced Thai Tea boba is great too! I have been wanting a place to get boba for awhile now and when I am in the mood I can just pop in! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts and coffee. So fresh! When I ordered a vanilla-hazelnut iced late, they asked if I like a more coffee taste. More coffee flavor of course, but the fact they took the time to ask the question is a sure sign I'll be a regular here. The donut was a crueler and it was ridiculously fresh and soft. Crazy delicious."}
{"text":"Love love love Express Donuts! The donuts are always so fresh and the staff is very friendly. The coffee is...meh... But the donuts more than make up for it!"}
{"text":"Express doughnuts has delicious doughnuts for a reasonable price! I have always gotten excellent customer service & they are efficient when the line is long. I have a large chain doughnut place by my house, but I'd rather drive further to Express!"}
{"text":"Express Donuts is a fabulous place! We're in town for a family wedding and were craving donuts. A large national chain is nearby, but we like to support the local economy whenever possible. Express Donuts has good reviews, so off we go. I consider myself somewhat of an apple fritter connoisseur, and Express Donuts delivers! In addition, they have a wide selection, and a blueberry donut that is to die for. In addition to our dozen donuts, I also got a large black coffee, all for about $12. We'll be going back at least once before we head back home!"}
{"text":"Even though it's about 20 minutes away, this has become our go-to donut place! Their maple donuts as well as orange glazed donuts are sooo good. I usually only go for the raised donuts but these cake ones are something else, I'm not sure what they put in them but they are addicting! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just as good as Rainbow Donuts and it is in Goodyear"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and got a honeydew smoothie with boba and a original glazed donut, not so bad! Not the best honeydew smoothie I've had but the boba was perfect! Not over cooked or too gooey like some other places. There wasn't anything special about the donut. This is probably the only place that sells boba smoothies in the west valley since Lollicup closed, smh -.-"}
{"text":"I looked this place up on Yelp yesterday because I wanted to try boba tea. The young woman working at the counter was really helpful: she explained all the types of teas and smoothies they sell and made me a chai boba tea and it was amazing! I also grabbed a dozen donuts, and the family loved them. Great little place, I will be back."}
{"text":"Best donuts hands down, and the customer service (family-owned) is terrific, love the Bavarian Creme and the Thai Tea Boba on ice!"}
{"text":"Besides having the best family owned donut shop in the valley, they're also my favorite place to buy coffee drinks. Their espresso is AWESOME."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect example of why people should gravitate more towards locally owned businesses as opposed to corporate owned chains.   The donuts are top notch and reasonably priced. They make the donuts fresh, which beats your quick gas station donut on the run.   I got a dozen donuts and my two favorites were the strawberry glazed cake donut and maple long john. The cake donuts are incredibly moist and the regular donuts are very light and fluffy with the perfect amount of frosting.   This place also offers smoothies and teas with or without boba and espresso!"}
{"text":"On my way home and had a Donut jones, so I yelped the nearest donut shop. Express Donuts came up. This is your typical mom and pops Donut shop. Same selection has most to offer. I had my apple fritter. The fritter was very good, warm, soft inside, but crispy on the outside, gooey frosting, and just enough apples. This was just a one time visit since I am not from this area, however I do recommend this Donut Shop,"}
{"text":"The donuts are fantastic!! I mean, as in everything you ever hoped or wished a donut to be. The flavor is wonderful, and it's cooked to perfection.   I had a ham and cheese croissant that made me want to immediately regret my decision to get only one. I wanted to drive back and get more. LOL!  This place has amazing food, and super friendly staff. If you live close by, you're lucky. If you live a distance away, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I went there today and tried the donuts. It's one of the greatest donuts. Their nice and fresh and taste delicious. I will be going back because my likes love their donuts."}
{"text":"Donuts!  Fresh and delicious  The donuts from Express are one of those tasty treats everyone should experience at least once.   Hot, light, and fluffy. I could eat a dozen by myself and for a mere $10 a dozen, what a delicious treat for a reasonable price.     If you have never visited Express to experience a  delicious glazed donuts then you must take advantage of the opportunity if you ever find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Nice lady behind the counter. Ham and swiss croissant rolls were pretty good. My daughter really liked her donut, but on the whole it was just too pricey to justify going back."}
{"text":"i don't usually eat donuts.  however, i will make an exception for express donuts!  these are light and fluffy with a bit of crunch.  so good!  i recently left arizona so i guess i'll go back to my donutless existence but you can and should enjoy the best donuts on the planet at express donuts--jealous already...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best around quality is amazing. It does get a little busy at times but handles crowd well"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for a quick donut and coffee. Cheap, delicious and efficient. Staff was very nice. Place was clean. I liked the blueberry filled donut."}
{"text":"This was my first yelp experience  and folks you did not disapoint the donuts were great. I also wanted  to try the Boba and whent with strawberry it was delish... so i had to try another one, honeydew and let me tell you it did not disapoint."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS DONUTS. This place has way better donuts than Krispy Kreme or any other chain donut shop because they taste homemade and are always fresh! A+! Great service as well. If you want coffee they have great coffee too! And boba!"}
{"text":"Neon sign displaying Boba caught my eye when I pulled up. I ordered three donuts which were nice and fresh. They have the usual variety of Boba flavors but decided to try the strawberry mango and I hate strawberry flavor. The cold drink is nice for a summer day and blended smoothly. Highly recommend if you never heard of Boba and have an open mind. Go support the local business and and enjoy a great donut."}
{"text":"Not impressed, ice coffee was just okay, donuts taste like dd and the older lady taking the order was rude. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their prices are very reasonable as well. I like getting the ham  and cheese with jalapeño croissant and iced Thai tea with boba. My kids love the boba."}
{"text":"This is a true neighborhood gem, So glad I found good boba and donuts in my area. Theres other top notch places on this side of town that I've tried and none measure up to what express donuts has to offer. My all time favorite is the taro blended boba tea and the ham and cheese danish, yum!!! They make their donuts fresh every morning I have yet to try one I dont like. Only thing that I'm not happy with is their hours, they close too early and when I need my boba fix in the late evening I end up driving a few miles to a different spot in the valley :( if you're in the neighborhood one day don't hesitate to stop in I promise they will not disappoint, this has been my go to spot for donuts and boba for the past 4 years and don't plan on changing that anytime soon:)"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had! Moist and perfectly sweet. Quick service and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"We love this local donut shop in the West Valley, every time we want donuts this is he place! The staff is very friendly, the donuts are very fresh and not overly sweet and over powering you know?! My kids love the wide selection of donuts and drinks. The prices are very reasonable and fair I feel."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts (check) Friendly service (check) Prices are reasonable (check) Will be going often (check) Super convenient location (check)"}
{"text":"Finally! Boba in the west valley!   They have a large variety of smoothies and drinks as well as some DELICIOUS donuts! I of course tried the Taro with boba and not only is it a beautiful shade of my favorite color, purple...it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  My lemon filled donut was also really good.  The young lady working the counter was very friendly and helpful.    I really hope this place makes it! Locally owned and that is what I support!!!"}
{"text":"Happy employees Good prices Fresh donuts Quick service  I like this place! Thanks!  **yelp thought my review was too short for some reason. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I've given any business five stars.   First let's start with my father's review since he doesn't yelp. He stated the place has a new customer. My dad wanted the bear claw to \"taste\" and confirm the validity of the donut shop. Well they won him over. The little apple surprise in the middle of the bear claw was the kicker for him. The donut shop reminds him of his childhood. Bravo!!!   I ordered the original donut. When I check out a new donut spot that's my signature go to item. Well it was delicious. It was better than KK and Lamar's. I even had a glazed donut which was yummy. When I want a donut this place will be the new spot. The donuts aren't pretty but taste damn good. I'll take taste over presentation any day."}
{"text":"Really good doughnuts, no doubt about that.  The maple is what I had and I really liked the frosting and the glazed was really good too... But the milk tea um not so much.  It tasted so much like powdered milk/creamer, nothing like milk tea.  I will come back for doughnuts, but only doughnuts."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for luring me to donuts!  I got a ham and cheese croissant plus 4 donuts (buttermilk, vanilla cake, glazed, and bavarian filled).  The young lady in the front was so sweet and helpful.  All the donuts were so good, light, and fluffy.  The croissant was very good too!  I need to go back to try the boboa drinks.  I can only handle so much sweetness at once!"}
{"text":"Had the jalapeno, ham & cheese croissant and it was very good.  Donuts were good too and workers are very nice."}
{"text":"5 stars. Good selection. Friendly staff. Just like all the donut places back home. When you don't want to visit Krispy Kreme of Dunkin, head over to Express!"}
{"text":"Oh my God I have to update my review last time I went they didn't have donuts they ran out at 11 AM but I went back ..these are the best tasting donuts I have ever tasted.. the doh they used to make the donuts is good that's the key to making a good donut is good oil, it made the donuts taste very good I had the hazelnut coffee and that was delicious"}
{"text":"I've started going here almost every Sunday morning to bring donuts home for the family.  The prices are reasonable, the donuts have always been fresh and I've never been disappointed with the selection.  If there's a better place to get donuts in the west valley, I'm not aware of it."}
{"text":"An occasional donut as a treat is nice.  Grocery and convenience store donuts are ok but rarely fresh.  I found Express Donuts cooks their products on site.  The baker fires up the ovens and fryers at midnight.    To take donuts to my 5 am job, I have to buy them the afternoon before.   That means they sit all day at the store and overnight at my home before I start work.  They taste old by that time.    I was telling the very nice sales person I wanted two dozen assorted donuts for tomorrow's work.  She suggested ordering now and pickup at 4 am.  Express Donuts does not open until 5 am.  She said they can schedule early orders with enough notice.     Wow, I'm going to be the hero in the morning.  Hot fresh donuts are a great way to start a Friday.  Thanks for being accommodating to my odd schedule!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome find! The doughnuts are fresh and light...no greasy after-taste like the chain donuts! The donut holes are like little sweet clouds of yum..The prices are very reasonable too! Check it out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"FRESH donuts, GREAT TASTING donuts, fresh coffee, and I LOVE the Taro Root boba! I only give it 4 stars because they close early!!! But then again they open super early so it's great for the early birds. Stay open past 6p please!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Express Donuts!!! They have been our family favorite for years now. We know to go early to get what we want because they close once they are sold out. I know this could be a frustrating policy for some, but it is to be respected. I would love to one day go in and buy them out early, so they can enjoy a day off and we can bless.our community helpers with these savory treats. If you have not been there, it is a must!!! Stop in early and you won't be disappointed!!! I cheer when we go by and they have already closed for the day, because we understand it is a sign that this community is choosing local business over national chains."}
{"text":"Best. Donuts. Ever.  Honestly.  It's kind of ridiculous how good they are.  Their donuts are super light, airy, fluffy, and flavorful. So basically if clouds could be tasted these would be what they'd taste like.  Heavenly. Which of course means you can have more cause they take up less space in your stomach right?!    (Though I'm not into cake donuts but my husband says theirs are really good too.)  And if you want a cloud in liquid form try their Pina Colada... and add boba if you're into that.  This place NEVER disappoints.  Best donuts on the west side by far."}
{"text":"I don't eat donuts very often, but when I do I prefer these.  You can taste the freshness."}
{"text":"Awesome made from scratch doughnuts. Way better than any chain or franchise. Too many faves to list but the buttermilk bars are a guilty pleasure. I like their ham and cheese croissants also. They also have boba teas."}
{"text":"This place's awesome. Yummy, sweet, delicious donuts. Much better than what you get at any grocery store. Prices are fair and their staff's very friendly. Stop by today and grab a dozen donuts for your coworkers. Trust me, you'll make everyone's day!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! Always soft and fresh!! I won't go anywhere else, not even Krispy Kreme"}
{"text":"Great Donuts...mouthwatering.  Judging from the outside I would have never guessed donuts could be this delicious.  Seriously Homer Simpson would be salivating!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like fresh donuts? Yum. Like the ham & cheese croissants (with jalapeños!) too. But really I come for the boba shakes. Taro is my favorite. The staff is very friendly. My local calorie splurge!"}
{"text":"These are by far the best donuts I have ever had. Krispy Kreme cannot touch this place. The donuts melt in your mouth. I favor their raspberry filled, my kids love their glazed donuts (twist, old fashioned), my mom loves their Apple fritter. They sell out fast, so get there early."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Goodyear!  They have a sister location in Buckeye.   Best donuts on the west side."}
{"text":"If you drive by the Starbucks on the corner you can get a real espresso at this place. Killer cinnamon rolls. And the staff seemed super friendly."}
{"text":"Donuts are excellent! I went in 20 minutes before they closed and the donuts were very fresh and still a large selection. Prices are good as well."}
{"text":"I have been quite curious about this place since it is the ONLY donut place close to us here in Goodyear. We were not disappointed! The donuts are FANTASTIC! They also sell boba which was so so good. Blended to the right consistency. I can't wait to become a regular here."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and honestly the best donuts I have ever eaten next to my grandmother's homemade ones. They melt in your mouth. Great variety but I lean toward the traditional glazed. The toasted coconut is also a favorite. They sell out early at times so if it's close to closing call and see if they are there. Support our local merchants who work so hard to put out a delicious product that you will thoroughly enjoy.  I went at 6am last Sunday when they opened thinking I would be the only one because who would be up at 6am on a freezing Sunday morning? Well evidently when the doors open it's a steady stream of people looking for their coffee and donut fix... even on a Sunday. I also tried their ham, cheese and jalapeño croissant breakfast sandwich and it was super fresh, the jalapeño gave it a nice kick (they offer it without jalapeño too) and it was a hit at home. Hope you Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm from a donut town-Dallas, TX, so I know what good donuts taste like. Anyway,  this place is not too bad. I've had better.  Donuts taste good in the morning, but after 11am, the taste is not the same. I haven't gone there much lately and last time I was there I asked if they made pig-in-a-blanket,  and she got so offended when I asked how come they didn't make them. It was just a question,  lady.  Anyway, I just wish they made pig-in-a-blanket.  But you can't have everything in the world!"}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews for this place and I thought I should try it myself.  We had the ham and cheese croissant with jalapeno and they warmed it up for us.  The very first bite was so good until you get to the ham and cheese with jalapeno and you're like in heaven.  It is really good so I came back one morning and got 10 more!!!    The boba are all good, I've tried the taro boba (the best), mango, passion fruit, avocado and honey melon and it was all very good, not too sweet, it's almost perfect.  My sister loves her with extra boba for additional .50 cents which isnt bad at all.  The donuts were all to die for, I had the plain donut and it was almost like it was deep fried and the rest was delicious.   I highly recommend this place to anyone living close to West Valley and if you're not, it is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is open at 5 am and I love that I wasn't the only one out and about at that hour . This place is very similar to Fresh Donuts in Buckeye, AZ and both are very delicious. The donut holes are so soft!!!  I also had the blueberry cake donut and chocolate cake donut with glaze and they were both fresh and outstanding. Great location right on the corner of Litchfield and McDowell and not far off the 10."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to LA.  The staff were all really nice.  Family owned.  Got the vanilla donut with nuts.  Was good but a bit too sweet for me.  Will stop by on the next drive to LA for breakfast."}
{"text":"Family-owned small business. This place has The Best regular glazed donut I've ever had. When family comes in to town, taking them to Express Donuts is usually on the agenda somewhere during their time in AZ."}
{"text":"My favorite place for donuts! This is by far the easiest place to get coffee from while I'm rushing to work."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts! The chocolate frosted old fashioned was amazing. Highly recommend! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"BEST DONUT ON PLANET EARTH!!!! I'm a donut junkie...fresh made only! These are the BEST in Arizona!!! Light, fluffy, perfect amount of glaze, the cake donuts aren't laden with grease just beautifully done and with coffee or milk it's a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of express donuts! I love love love their donuts. It melts in your mouth with the right amount of sweetness unlike other donuts. They have good customer service, nice and friendly people. My favorite of all time is the the chocolate glazed donut.  I want more please."}
{"text":"Fabulous donuts, great prices, friendly service - this place rocks!  I'm so happy that we have some place like this in the west valley now. I'd much rather support this delicious fabulous local business then a huge ok franchise.  Selection is great and they were just as delicious when we broke into them the next morning then they were when we bought them.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ask for the chocolate eclair with cream. And the ham jalapeño and cheese croissant is yum, if they have any left ;) treat yo'self!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews.  Drove out of my way and stopped by during normal business hours. They were closed. No note on the door or anything. A lot of other people walked up too. I give 2 stars for hopefulness that I'll eventually be able to stop by and they'll actually be open and I can write a better review."}
{"text":"Love the donuts.  Tried the new Krispy Kreme and Express Donuts is so much better!!!   Love the buttermilk donuts.  They also do a great orange cake donut."}
{"text":"When I heard Goodyear was getting a place that serves boba smoothies,I was stoked! Went in when they first opened and will never stop going back. Not to mention their maple bars are to die for! Service has always been exceptional. Once they knew I was a regular,I was treated as if I was a friend. I tell all my friends about this place."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel so disgusting in the most beautiful harmonious way...   Their donuts are super soft and always fresh. The employees that work here are friendly and very chill. I can't eat here too much because I'd probably die but definitely the best donuts on this side of town."}
{"text":"I really really want to give them 5 stars but I despise that they close whenever they want to. About 6 out of ten times that I've been there, it is always closed because they ran out of donuts. Their service is amazing and I love that they do an amazing job with my boba but the business hours are beyond poor."}
{"text":"I had read and re-read some of the reviews and convinced a friend to come with me to grab a couple donuts. We stopped by on a Thursday (12/8), just a little after lunch time. There was nobody inside, but the smell of donuts permeated the air. The owner told us they had just finished making a number of donuts less than an hour ago. So, they were fresh! And they were all $.98.   I got a regular glazed and a Bavarian cream filled chocolate glazed doughnut. My friend also got the Bavarian cream filled and a twisted regular glazed piece of goodness! They smelled so darn good that I could not wait to sink my teeth into them. As soon as I got in the car, I tore a piece of that glazed one and stuffed myself with it. It was absolutely FANTASTIC!! It was a soft, fresh, and sugary delight!!   I will be going back!"}
{"text":"The best donuts!  FRESH and GREAT price!!  We are there every sunday morning with the line out the door!  Love supporting the local small businesses"}
{"text":"Fabulous donuts! Fresh and tasty. Great selection if you come early. Nice coffee drinks as well. Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I can honestly tell you that every donut I tried this morning was amazing!! The maple bar was light as air and the maple was creamy and delicious. The chocolate w/ rainbow sprinkles was a cake donut and the center was tender and light and the outside was perfectly crisp! Then the crumb donut... Such delicious crispy crumb covering.. with that light tender cake inside. Best donuts in a looooong time. I will for sure be back.... Just no more than once a month!! (The apple fritter review will have to wait.... I'm stuffed lol)"}
{"text":"Bomb donut spot. Get you some! Really nice people running the joint. The only complaint that I have is that they close early. I plan on trying their boba soon!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I have developed donut addiction to this place! I've never cared much for sweets, but these are light and fluffy inside with just the right amount of sweetness glazed on the outside!  Crave them in the evening too! Selection is obviously better in the morning than in the late afternoon, but I don't care, must have their tasty donuts!  I usually get a 1/2 dozen which is slightly under $5. I'm happy to support a local business and eat delicious, tasty donuts.   These are way better than Bashas, Safeway, or DD too!   VERY friendly too! More friendly than employees that work at the grocery store bakery chains.  I think I want their donuts now! Yum!"}
{"text":"These donuts are actually really good and where I'm from no businesses sell boba so that's awesome too. I tried the Thai Tea smoothie and it was good, but the Taro is the way to go. And the employees are super nice."}
{"text":"Great taste, and one of the best Id say around here! Everyone needs to try this! Its a big bonus that the west side has something like this.  Definitely recommend this to people to try."}
{"text":"They were out of half of the donuts on the menu in the middle of the day. The customer service was also very unwelcoming."}
{"text":"I learned about this place through Yelp's suggestions a while back.  I stopped by for the first time this morning, and they lived up to their Yelp reputation.  Good prices, great donuts, and very fast & friendly customer service.  I will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Great donuts that are super fresh and delish every time!!! Always able to quickly get what we need and get out. Not the biggest selection of donuts but they always have our favorites!"}
{"text":"best donut holes!!! fast and friendly service too"}
{"text":"Bubble teas and sweet sweet carbs...  The West Valley doesn't have a lot of good options for people who like nonstandard Asian fare.  Growing up in Taiwan for a while, my bubble tea intake has been limited to trips to Chandler.  No more!  And my little girl loves the donut holes with her taro boba slush once a week.  I may be giving her diabetes, but she's a happy kid.  The staff is very nice and works to accommodate.  My hope is that they will do well despite the lack of street advertising.  We customers will need to put the word out so they stay in town.  The Avondale Sports Center area would be even better as a location!  Imagine: A butter burger from Culver's + Express Donut bubble tea.   Mmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Their donuts are so fresh and soft. My coworkers and I always go to buy  the dozens. I'm a content customer"}
{"text":"This place can be considered a hidden gem! Absolutely love their milk teas & smoothies (and I've had a lot of milk teas and smoothies from various places in my life), and donuts are really good, too. Many of them aren't overdone on the sugar, glaze, or frosting, which I really like. They are also inexpensive. Also, their thai milk tea or thai smoothie with boba are so good.  It's one of the only places (if not the only place, that I know of) like it on the west side, so I am even more thankful for it because of that! I just have to restrict myself from going there every day or even every week!"}
{"text":"Great fresh donuts.  Family owned & pretty quick service.  If you want old fashion donut shop donuts.  This is the place to go in the west valley.  I recommend the bear ckaw or something even sweeter the apple fritter."}
{"text":"It's kinda hard to find it at first, but when my wife and I did we declared that we would come here for a donut and boba fix for life! Lol! . Service is great, boba is amazing, donuts are to die for. They make everything fresh and ready to serve. Oh! Before I forget their Thai tea  was tasty too! Also kinda random, but if you need buckets they sell them for 2 bucks a pop along with the lid."}
{"text":"The donuts are always fresh and the service is friendly.  I prefer to support local, small businesses.  In this case, not only is the product better than you can get at the chain stores, the prices are better.  The ham, cheese,and jalapeno croissants are awesome, if you're looking for something more substantial (and less sweet) than a donut."}
{"text":"Best donuts and friendliest staff in the west valley.  Always fresh, delicious, wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very good donuts on this side of town! Their ham and cheese croissants is a must, quick bite of that savory goodness washed down with their taro Boba shake."}
{"text":"Great donuts, breakfast croissants, and coffee. Love the prices- almost half of what I pay at other places! Worth checking out- currently less than $8 for a dozen donuts!"}
{"text":"Great Donuts! Love the coconut donut. Prices are very reasonable. Try their boba drink the purple boba drink is a good one. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM! Not only is the staff super friendly the donuts are delicious! They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the icing? Awesome! I will definitely be back but next time I am only getting the exact amount we need so I don't keep eating the leftovers lol"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a doughnut shop in this part of the valley and this place does not disappoint!   Source: My dad was a police officer."}
{"text":"I just came here & have been here before the donuts are excellent....MANAGEMENT is the problem they have set hours & this is the 3rd time I have stopped here & they are closed before the actual time. I will find another donut spot they indeed lose me as customer....Can't run a business like that....Management set your time, hire responsible people, & don't close before hours."}
{"text":"Best doughnuts hands down! , all the doughnuts I've tried were so good and  fresh. My go to doughnut shop from now on."}
{"text":"I had a peach black tea and honestly its was gross. It had a nice peach taste but for some reason the aftertaste was awful. Like it had horseradish or something in it idk. My friend had a mango smoothie and it wasn't terrible but there was a major overload of sweetened condensed milk.And just tasted funny, but the bobas texture was perfect and the donuts are great. Especially the Bavarian cream donut; very light, airy, and slight chewiness. Definitely better than the donuts at Safeway or bashas."}
{"text":"Great doughnuts. Not greasy at all. Good strong hot coffee. Friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious doughnuts! Been coming here for years and quality always stays the same!"}
{"text":"The place to be! Half dozen assorted is my Sunday special. Baked fresh light as air but full of flavor"}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts. Warm, moist, and soft. I loved the glazed donuts here when I stopped by. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They have amazing donuts, the chocolate old fashion donut is really good. I recommend it. Also the staff here are friendly. Always make you feel valued as customer. I would recommend going here and supporting a local business as well. They are worth it."}
