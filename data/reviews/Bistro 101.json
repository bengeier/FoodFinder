{"text":"Worth every penny. Paying for a good, well thought entree is always so worth it! This is one of my favorite restaurants and im so glad its in mount horeb. Try any special they offer. The filet is tender and unlike anything I've had. The service is personable and genuine. I recommend the bistro to anyone who enjoys good fresh local food made to perfection."}
{"text":"I was skeptical. Random place in Mount Horeb, WI that has prices like a downtown Madison steakhouse. But I have to say, they get a quality cut of meat. I had the filet, medium rare. It was cooked properly and very tender. Clearly a high end steak and cooked by a chef that knows how to do it. My only constructive advice is the sauce. I usually don't want any sauce, but if there is one, it should be rich and savory. Red wine and butter. This one was sort of funky. The mash and vegetables that came with it were fine but nothing exceptional. She had the orecchiette, which comes with mushroom and goat cheese. It was very rich and flavorful, but not homemade pasta. We had pre-dinner cocktails at the bar. They make a good Old Fashioned, but even the happy hour prices were steep. $8 for a Korbel..  Overall, I will be back for a steak. They could improve happy hour and prices overall, and the accompaniments. I recommend getting pre-dinner drinks elsewhere, then heading over for a steak without expectations for the side dishes. But if you don't want to head downtown for a good cut of beef, this is the place."}
{"text":"We love Bistro 101. Great food, great service and it's a warm, cozy place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We shared the stuffed dates appetizer and they were delicious.  Next was a cup of mushroom bisque. Also yummy. I had the Mediterranean chicken and loved it. The presentation was beautiful. My friend had the shrimp pasta and enjoyed it. We shared two Creme Brûlée for dessert. Outstanding.  The drinks were great. House wine very nice. Service was prompt and top notch. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"When we go to Mt. Horeb, we make sure to dine at Bistro 101, which is by far the best restaurant around. 

We always sit at a two-top by the bar, because the bartender is very knowledgeable and outgoing, so we tend to learn a lot about different liquids when we are there. Plus, they tend to stock rare and unique spirits, so trying them is always a fun experience. 

We ordered the mushroom bisque, the chilled trout appetizer, the Greek chicken, and the pesto pasta. The soup was perfect: creamy without overdoing it, and with a perfect mushroom taste. I could have eaten five more bowls (I didn't). Of course, the trout was wonderful -- served on baguette slices and topped with red onion, the combination of flavors was perfect. 

I liked my pesto pasta, although I am not a big fan of zucchini in pasta, as it always seems like more of a filler than a vegetable that is actually enjoyable. But the pesto itself was very good. S. really liked his Greek chicken, although the potatoes and vegetables were his favorite parts. 

The service at Bistro 101 can't be beat. We chatted with the staff about the World Cup and unique brands of gin and whiskey, and we didn't want for anything. It was definitely a highlight of our trip to Mt. Horeb."}
{"text":"Hi all. We had a nice dinner there don't get me wrong. But there was nothing about it that should have warranted the huge cost. My pot pie was $25  ( yes pot pie ) ..my husbands burger...$11.  It was a birthday dinner and when my husband made that statement to our waitress, she did say happy birthday...but an upscale eatery should have brought something special to my table. If I would have been at Apple Bees or ANYWHERE else for that matter, they would have acknowledged the special event. In the end we agreed the food was good....but totally not worth the cost in any way. I really didn't get it. I would have rather had three meals dining elsewhere, than one meal there. I work hard for my money and I want value when I go out to eat. Mt. Horeb is a cute piss nothing little farm town...not Chicago. Food should not be priced that way or served that way there. That's my opinion. I see lots of great reviews on here...I guess what some people pay for a dinner out doesn't really matter to them, which tells me they must not cook at home at all and think that food is amazing just because it's cooked for them. I felt the meal overpriced for what I received. I felt screwed over to be honest. Fine dining usually will have bread on the table...here you had to buy bread to go with your meal if you wanted it. Entrees including nothing...everything was extra. Would I eat there again...NO I'm sorry but I would not. I have to feel I'm getting something for my money., I have to feel like I'm paying you because I couldn't possibly make this at my home. I felt neither. I wish I could have the birthday dinner as a do-over actually, and go to a different place. Sorry...I got to be honest. Hi prices doesn't mean its better."}
{"text":"We ate the flatbread pizza ~ WOW!  Really, the best I've ever had.  

The spinach salad was perfect ~ awesome combination of ingredients and dressing.

The mashed potatoes were comfort food at it's best.

And...to top it off they make the perfect cosmo.

We were passing through town, stopped at a couple pubs

We looked at menus and atmosphere and landed here.  We were so glad we did.

Great service as well."}
{"text":"The bistro in Mount Horab Wisconsin is a must go to if you enjoy great food and awesome eating establishment with a Great selection of wine and a top shelf Drinks."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting in Bistro 101 with my 2 year old after a private party that I was not invited to, punching at my laptop, sipping on something dark and yummy from a Spring-Green Brewery.

I'm playing hookie you see, checking in virtually every couple hours so they don't realize that I'm not in the office - God Bless big Corporate America and the immigrants who make it great.

Despite being closed, the proprietor let us in in while mummy checked out the trolls in town.   I can't vouch for the Cuisine other than the delish OatMeal-Coconut cookies we were given, but the hospitality here will certainly bring me back for a meal someday."}
{"text":"The bar/restaurant is great - ambience very nice! Seemed our chance to order a \"fancier\" meal in the area. Our waitress was very polite and friendly but unfortunately was forced to read extremely lengthy descriptions of menu items and specials off a piece of paper, which we don't blame her for no one could have remembered all of that! By the time she got to the second or third item we had already forgot the first.
Oysters on the half shell for an appetizer! Delicious!
Bowl of French onion soup, delicious!
Bottle of wine delicious! Mixed drinks not so much... Ran out of Bacardi (which I thought was a bar staple), when asked for top shelf whiskey received no help or suggestions even from the bartender. 
One ordered a steak ($44) and one ordered pasta with a tomato sauce and andouille sausage... 
And things were going along so smoothly! The steak had a nice char to it from the grill but unfortunately no other flavor or seasoning, and the pasta entrée, was very bland especially considering the ingredients.
Will definitely go again at some point for wine and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Drinks: Phenomenal bar service from Marco the bartender.  
Atmosphere: Can you believe we're in Mount Horeb?  Swanky bar and dining room for the troll town. 
Food: Delish local cheese, meat, vegetables and other yummies.   
$$$:  I don't mind paying extra for this type of food and service"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant as someone in town recommended it to me as \"very good\".  I was expecting an excellent experience in all aspects a restaurant should provide.  Here is my review:
- FOOD PREPARATION, TASTE & PRESENTATION: Very good, great chef, no complaints on the food itself.  It was also served in good time, although it was not a \"busy\" day (well, all restaurants close at 9pm in this town).  However considering the price (see next), the food experience was Not impressive as I would have expected, it was just good.
- PRICE: Terrible, TOO EXPENSIVE in general, and utterly expensive for the area. The prices are about double what several other restaurants in same town will charge. $36 for a salmon dish?; $45 for a steak dish?, $25 for a chicken dish? I can have dishes like these in large city restaurants like NY and LA for less money, well prepared, well presented and all !!.
  But also, the devil is in the details:  this restaurant does not have tablecloths nor cloth napkins (with those prices I would expect them!); and the WORSE, they attempted to charge us for bread (which I consider a huge insult in a restaurant !!), this is the 2nd time in my life that I find a restaurant which attempts to charge you for bread.  We even ordered a soup of the day, among other things and not even crackers, oyster crackers or bread was offered with it.  Bread was not offered at all.  I'm not sure if this the midwest style?.
(This a manager's/owner's fault).
- SERVICE: Our server was nice, efficient and attentive.  However, even though there was nothing wrong with the service; it was the bare minimum.  There was no interest or effort put in offering our table any alternatives or options that could improve the restaurant experience and justify the steep prices by at least providing an exceptional service and dining experience.  My assumption is that servers are not motivated/empowered enough by mgmt to do so (well, especially if they intend to charge you for every bread crumb).  (This is also a manager's/owner's fault)

Next time I'm town, I do not plan to return to Bistro 101."}
{"text":"When my parents asked me to meet them for dinner in Mount Horeb, I was skeptical. Both have discerning tastes that lead them to mostly eat in because they live at least 20 minutes from a good restaurant, and my mother is a very good cook. I guess sometimes your parents are right, because I've been coming back to Bistro 101 every time my parents are in town, or I have an excuse to eat in Mount Horeb.

First of all, the people who work there are wonderful. After one dinner, the next time I came in, Marco remembered my name and that I love seafood, so would I like to try the halibut tonight? (Yes, you want to try the halibut if it's available) The bar features a limited wine list (but standard for the area), but Marco is generous with his pours, which is great for catching up with family over.

Bistro 101 is the only place outside of Madison that my father will order steak. Maybe this is in part because they let him choose the filet before they cook it. This is a restaurant that is about more than fantastic food - it's also the friendly atmosphere cultivated by the staff.

I am partial to seafood so I usually order the halibut or crab cakes, though I know they plan to branch out into difference cuisine in 2014. The sides are a more standard pilaf, but the roasted vegetables served in the winter are a wonderful accompaniment to most of the dishes. My family is partial to sharing so I've had steak and it was perfect; I've tried it rare and medium well, since mom and dad differ on how they prefer steak cooked, and both ways are delicious. The wait staff and kitchen are accommodating to any special requests, and most of the menu can be made gluten free.

The aesthetics of the restaurant are such that you'd swear you were in Madison: heavy on wood and white tile accent which are reminiscent of a time past. The prices are Madisonian as well, but worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, at best. Extremely overpriced. Don't have what they advertise and then they don't compensate for the shortcoming. I was really looking forward to coming here and was completely disappointed. I will never come back. My husband felt the same."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for drinks and a romantic dinner out.  The burger was so great, the scotch was very good and the chocolate cake we had was quite delicious.

I would recommend this place and I will be back for drinks with my wife in the future."}
{"text":"Worth the drive!  Very friendly staff, fantastic steak (perhaps one of the best filet mignons I have ever had).  Good bar. 

My wife, who is not a carnivore at all, even opted to try a steak and raved about it!

Very sophisticated, upscale feel.  Stellar service, fantastic food.  
Can't wait to go back on a date night! 

Make sure to make reservations if you go on a weekend-I'm sure it gets busy."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at Bistro 101.  I ordered the duck and my wife had the halibut. Both were specials and would highly recommend them when available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We had reservations for a Friday night and we were seated immediately upon arriving.  The waitress was really nice and friendly and gave us complimentary shots of something delicious... maybe it had rhubarb in it??  Our drinks were great, and the food is some of the best in the Madison area.  We had a mushroom (I think they were morels?) appetizer that was perfectly balanced with the light flaky pastry and delicious sauce.  Then we had the bacon wrapped fig appetizer and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  Seriously, you need to order this, you will be so happy you did.  It was complex and a little bit goes a long way, but the flavors explode in your mouth.  We had the lamb dinner, and again, top notch.  Then we had the two creme brulee desserts - my husband had the brown sugar and I had the dark chocolate.  He liked his better and I liked mine better, so I'm not sure there was a clear winner, but we were both so happy with our choice.  The cool creamy custard with the hot crispy sugared top... yum.   This is going to be my go-to restaurant for birthday dinners, anniversary dinners, and any time I get to choose where we eat!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have dinner at Bistro 101.  And then...

They were out of all the dishes that I really wanted to try.  As second choice, I got the Butternut Squash soup.  No flavor.  As second choice, I got the Greek Chicken.  Absolutely nothing Greek about it.  The bartender (Marco) knew the parties on both sides of me.  He talked at length with them and gave them great service.  I sat virtually ignored in between them, to the point of him probably not even realizing that I would have ordered more food and more drink if he had offered. 

With a disappointed palette, I went across the street for good wine, good service, and good conversation with real people. 

I love supporting local businesses.  But Bistro 101 needs more competition to up their game and be deserving of their 'great' reputation."}
{"text":"You only have to come once, and you'll become a regular.  The food is spectacular, with a changing menu (seasonal and locally available items).  Every dish I have had here has been amazing.  Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"When you think of Mount Horeb, WI you may not think of gourmet eateries but Bistro 101 is certainly a great place to get a very good meal with outstanding service. On our last visit my wife and I had a great red wine along with fresh baked bread and an outstanding mushroom soup - it was super delicious. The waitress recommended the hanger steak and it was so tender it could literally be cut with a fork. YUM Even though the prices are a bit on the high side I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a high quality gourmet experience."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Mount Horeb, this is a great restaurant.  The food was really good - some local dishes, some seeminly cajun influence.  The menu was somewhat short, yet almost everything looked really good.  

The prices might be a bit high, but worth the price, in my opinion.  Not your every day restaurant, but a nice treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE The Bistro! They have a small main menu but you go there for the specials. We have never been disappointed. And look forward to the appetizers sent out from the kitchen. We did gazpacho shooters tonight. What a treat! The Bistro is a definite must go!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Bistro 101 and I'm definitely a fan!  I don't get to Mount Horeb very often, but I would absolutely go back, if only to eat there again! The service is great - enthusiastic and helpful - very passionate about their local food and their menu.

All 3 of my friends ordered the Halibut and they LOVED it! In fact, they barely spoke they were so focused on their delicious dinners. I was in a red meat mood so I ordered the Bistro Burger. Winning!!! It was a really fantastic burger! The meat is local and HIGH quality, it was cooked perfectly medium rare and the pretzel bun was magic. No kidding, best pretzel bun I've ever had! The potato wedges were good, nothing special, but a nice side. However, the burger was the star.

Let's talk wine for a minute. I'm a big red girl. I love the big reds and typically, I go for a nice cabernet. We ordered a bottle of the 2011 Homefront Red by Murphy-Goode (Santa Rosa, CA) and it was ideal. SUPER good! We all loved it! I'm going to try to find it locally so I can buy some bottles for home. Yes, that good! And a portion of each bottle sold goes to Operation Homefront so that's one more thing to feel good about."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. But it was just...Meh (as this 2-star rating is described). I loved the idea of driving out of Madison to try a gourmet restaurant (with gourmet prices) in a quaint town.  I looked at the menu beforehand and was looking forward to having the flavors of the appetizers and entrees dance on my palate. 

DRINKS: My chombard martini was nice; my husband ordered a vodka gimlet, but the Rose's lime juice was mistakenly (?) left out so he had to ask for a shot of Roses.  Otherwise, it was straight up stiff vodka.  Huh.  Ok.  

FOOD:  Of the two appetizers, two specialty drinks, salad and soup, and two dinner entrees we ordered, only one could be described as delicious, and one other, I describe as hearty and flavorful.  

Appetizers: We ordered the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese - this was the highlight of the meal.  Superb flavor.  The other appetizer was the lox on toasted, thinly sliced baugette - it was nice, but just ok - nothing extraordinary.  The mushroom bisque was the hearty and flavorful item.  Very thick...almost like a thick, thick stew...maybe too thick? But tasty.  Salad was standard fare.  

And they charge $6 for a baguette and garlic butter.  We decided to order it to see why it was so special that they had to charge for bread (a rarity).  The baguette was very soft and warm...the garlic butter was nicely whipped, but didn't really have flavor.  Needed more garlic and salt perhaps? I don't recommend the baguette - it was nothing special, especially for $6. 

My husband got the ahi tuna special with glass noodle cakes which were interesting but tasteless as glass noodles are. The ahi tuna was nice, but overcooked.  I was most disappointed for the dish I was most looking forward to:  the 1/2 duck with door county marinade and chestnut dressing.  It was far too overcooked - dry, tough, and even part of the duck was burnt to a crisp.  I nibbled on the dressing and remarked to my husband that I preferred his mom's dressing.  He agreed. I couldn't eat the duck and dressing - it was unsavory - so had it packed up to take home thinking maybe as leftovers it would somehow become delicious.  Turns out, I couldn't even eat it at home either the next day - took one bite of the duck, spit it out and threw it all in the garbage. Duck, as a dark meat, is usually so flavorful and juicy...this was the exact opposite.

ENVIRONMENT: The ambiance was not what I expected from pictures and reviews.  We sat in the fireplace room and it felt like we were in an art gallery with the BRIGHT track lighting - maybe ok for lunch, but for dinner, a dimmer light would've helped the atmosphere.  

SERVICE: The service was friendly, but not overly attentive. The server was knowledgable of the menu but...yeah...not overly attentive. I agree with another review about this place...it was 'bare minimum' service. We had to flag down our server a few times. 

Overall, I was disappointed and left with a 'meh' feeling. Probably won't return or recommend to others.  Wish I could, but I can't.  Considering the prices, I expected a lot more.  Glad we had a $50 gift card to use on this meal."}
{"text":"Combination of slow and distracted service, inaccurate entrees and an unimpressive facility. 

I asked for an ingredient to be left out; the server said \"well, I'll ask\". She confirmed that it could be done, but it wasn't. Scallops in the carbonara were dime sized and it was pretty dull. 

Server was MIA most of the evening and was not familiar with menu or bar offerings. 

Facility is kind of an enclosed strip mall; steak special is $64. Simply put, I don't get this place. Absolutely won't stop again."}
{"text":"5/5 on the food. Had the scallops special and the salmon special and they were both amazing. The mashed potato and risotto cake sides were amazing and the vegetables were amazing. There was probably too much butter on the food but it was SOOOOOOO good. 3/5 on the atmosphere. It is In a small mall.  Fine since everything else is closed. Not romantic at all. Would definitely come back. A little pricey."}
{"text":"A wonderful Little corner bistro in Mount Horeb. The Bistro has good food and an incredible whiskey selection and extremely friendly service. 

There are times when the service can be a bit slow and some of the items are a bit pricey at times but well worth the wait and the price. And if you like whiskey this is a wonderful place to sit, relax and enjoy a cocktail or straight up whiskey with your friends and enjoy a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"If you haven't made a visit to Bistro 101 recently, you are missing out. The menu is incredible and the service is impeccable. They've also added a Happy Hour which comes in handy when meeting friends or co-workers. The variety of drinks are reasonably priced, there is a featured cocktail, and the most delicious of flatbreads, too."}
