{"text":"**3.5 Stars** YOGI NOODLE!!  Okay, so yogi noodles is not just your average chinese cafe. They offer a wide variety of all sorts including BBQ duck, pork and stuff. The food I would say is pretty decent and cheap. I had a satay beef vermicelli for lunch the other day and it was only $5.99 which includes a hot drink! But i normally order cold drinks for extra $0.70.  I would not reccomend the cold milk tea or coffee, as it is always really off. Overall, pretty decent place to eat for lunch or afternoon tea for its price. I would've gave 4 stars, but that milk tea is preventing me to do so."}
{"text":"Came here with a few coworkers for Friday lunch - i think everyone had a decent experience.   I ordered the beef short ribs + spaghetti + hk milk tea.  i recommend not getting the hot hk milk tea - it didn't taste very good (i've definitely had way better). but the short ribs were really good.   Someone ordered a duck + bbq pork combo + rice and veggies - it was $8.50 but came with only 3 pieces of duck and less than 10 pieces of bbq pork.   the deep fried pork + curry was fairly good.  Don't know if i'll come back - mostly because i feel that there are better choices that are just as close by :)"}
{"text":"I did not know that Yogi has another branch.  This is the first time I have visited this restaurant.  I expect it to be a Hong Kong style restaurant.  But what I find is that it is not only a HK style restaurant, it is also a Cantonese restaurant, congee place, breakfast area.  It is a Chinese restaurant with all kinds of menu.  Actually to go through all menus take some time.   The fried Chicken black pepper sauce with spaghetti is average.  The chicken is tender but the sauce is thick and seems like lots of corn starch. It is not expensive.  I cannot rate the service as it is late and all waiters together with the chef are having their dinner.    I like the d√©cor from the previous restaurant Le Chine.  Don't know why they torn down a lot and make it looks like a cafeteria.  May be they want to give customers a feeling for a economic place to dine out.  It starts from breakfast all the way to late dinner.  I pay with my Visa"}
{"text":"Meh... I'd say the only reason to come here is for their ice lemon tea.  It's awesome.  If you're in the neighbourhood and looking for a quick okay bite, why not give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Is the name for real? What was the owner thinking? You just have to get over the interesting name and the bright yellow/ green signage. Pure tackiness! But once inside you are greeted by a friendly staff and comfortable seating. And this place is relatively clean! Maybe coz its new?  Now, I have to comment on their menu. We sat down and were presented with a stack of different menus. They try to do it all here: HK baked dishes, home cooking dishes, bubble tea, ramen, congee, BBQ, sizzling plates,etc,etc. It took us 15-20 min to pour over the menus and decide. Ordered steak and lobster platter ($25) and their signature lemongrass pan fried pork chop with rice ($7-8)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The place is pretty good . Good solid decor with a decently clean feel.  Food is pretty good. The traditional hong kong style food. Combination of east and western foods.  Drinks they serve can be better, as they are a huge part of h.k style cafe/restaurants. Overall I enjoyed it and will be coming back"}
{"text":"Had their congee and noodle combo. Congee was very tasteless. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast; arrived at 10:30am; ordered a simple ham macaroni and toast; waited for more than 45 min before getting the order; most likely the waiter forgot to put in order / kitchen lost our order; waiters were not attentive at all, except one waitress; Hot HK style tea was not that good either."}
{"text":"Love love Yogi Noodle... I am all about portion, quality and price and this restaurant has it all. One thing that some people might be overwhelemed with is there menu. They do have quite a variety of food on their menu but hey most Hk \"Tea Style Cafe\" are all like that. The staff are very friendly, the food comes out in a timely manner. My bf is definitely a big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Found this delightful place on night on the way to my hotel and thought I'd give it a shot!  A delightful place that serves your usual Chinese/Hong Kong varieties!  On the night I came I ordered a Cantonese Chow mein and Taiwanese style fried chicken.  Prices are very reasonable and quality is excellent!  In the area there are a million Chinese places but this place has lots of tables and room.  Service is quick and food is good!  What else can you expect?  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yogi Noodle Delight (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/yogi-noodle-scarborough) opens up another location up in Richmond Hill.  The menu are identical for both restaurants. The only difference is the decoration. This location is bigger and newer... much much bigger...  Food wise is standard Hong Kong Styled Cafe Fast Food... cheap and affordable and you will not leave hungry....  Dried Oyster, Vegetable & Lean Pork Congee/Chow Mein in Soya Sauce ($5.99) - Big Big bowl of Congee, taste pretty good but hardly have any pork - Chow Mein though really small in portion but go well with the congee  Korean Spicy Fatty Beef Noodle in Soup with drink ($5.99) - a few piece of kimchi on top... the noodle surprising are instant noodle taste and look alike? - Fatty Beef not too fatty but are quite tender - Milk Tea is strong and smooth and have great aroma  Services here are fast and friendly. But you will have to listen to waitresses chatting and gossiping to each other on top of their voices... doesn't it feels like home?  Cash only!"}
{"text":"Yogi noodle by far my favorite Chinese restaurant for it being cheap good combos and such. Yes you can find restaurant that may have more variety better foods and all, but can you beat yogi with pricing? It's not that you only get what you pay for, you get awesome lunch dinner combos at reasonable price and the place is clean, not ghetto. I don't see why yogi noodle only got 3 stars. It's a five for me, if I didn't mind eating Chinese food everyday, I'd eat here everyday."}
