{"text":"These wings are amazing!!! I got delivery and they were still warm when they got here!! So crispy and saucy!"}
{"text":"Ordered  the 51 wings they offer for 34.99 wings weren't bad but weren't great either. They serve decent sized wings but some were overcooked and extremely hard so hard that we couldn't even eat most of the wing. Buts not the worst part, ordering 51 wings you would think you'd get some variety of sauces. No, you get 2, for 51 wings 2 sauces. Oh and you get a small cup of ranch, 1 small cup. Extra is 50 cents per cup. I was also charged a dollar for paying with my debit card. Just and FYI for those not paying cash. I wasn't told and only asked due to my total being way over the standard 7% tax. Overall I'd say not a horrible product just overpriced. Don't think I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"OMG, the best tasting hot Italian hoagie I've ever had. My hubs and I can't get enough. I do wish they were bigger (it's an 8 inch bun, I think.) The wings are great too. I've only had 3 of the 51 offered flavors, but the sauces are exceptional and the wings are meaty. A great addition to our food delivery rotation."}
{"text":"Great to have something different to order from. The wings were good nothing out of the ordinary. Many flavors to choose from. I also ordered the chicken bowl. Yum. Only wish there was an option to add gravy.  Delivery was on time."}
{"text":"Been here twice both times we were not disappointed.  Wings were decent sized and the sauce was good.  The staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Figured we would give them a shot oneday, and now I order at least twice a month----tried several different flavors of the 51 so far....Hot Cheese balls, they are a must with every order of wings  And if your a fan of funnel cakes-----try the funnel cake straws....Soooooo Good"}
{"text":"51wings is the only place i eat wings from. Every Time i get wings from here pickup or delivery they are always crispy. Unlike the hit and miss with everywhere else. It is hard to get wings that are still crispy when delivered   but 51 wings has figured out the secret.   I love the cajun gold and signature hot.  My Girlfriend gets the dry ranch and hot pepper cheese balls that i end up helping her finish.  Thanks 51 wings for the guarantee of a quality  chicken wing . Best in the burgh"}
{"text":"I am so happy that 51 Wings and Things is close to my house! The wings are a great price and very tasty.  My favorites are the Honey BBQ and the Old Bay Ranch. The Garlic Butter Parm wings are also very good.  Their French fries and mozzarella sticks are also tasty.  It is very easy to place an order for pick up or delivery.  Everyone who works there is very friendly and the wait times/delivery times they tell you are accurate.  We order these for movie nights, Pens games and parties.  I've picked wings up to take to friends' homes and have gotten them hooked as well!"}
{"text":"Lord of the Wings?......not!! Bought 102 wings for birthday party. They were  1. Very small 2. Very overcooked to the point of crunchy. 3. Very expensive !! Could have bought whole pieces of chicken at the Eagle for about the same price."}
{"text":"The best fish sandwich I have found so far in the Burgh!  They are huge & cheap. Also have homemade perogies for lent. Order early because they sell out almost every Friday!"}
{"text":"Excellent every time. Always hot and fresh. I usually stick with mild garlic butter parm wings, and they are always cooked perfectly. Delivery to my location is always an accurate 45 min. Drivers are always friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best wings in town. Many sauces to choose from. The garlic sticks are the best I have ever had. Not too much garlic and crispy."}
{"text":"We order from here about weekly to every other week.  I've had the steak salad, which is enough for one person and then some, and loaded with fresh toppings--sometimes with too much raw onion.  The steak is really shaved steak (think: Steak Ums).  I tried the breaded chicken instead with a sauce on it.  I will warn you that the sauce sinks to the bottom and your lettuce wilts, so tread lightly with the sauces.  We've had wings on numerous occasions.  I really like the Honey Old Bay (just as it sounds), Sweet & Hot (honey or brown sugar and hot sauce), and the honey garlic--seeing a theme here?  I do like their dry seasonings because they cook their wings very well, which is my preference.  My husband always orders sandwiches--usually the Philly Steak, which he likes.  Unfortunately, we lived in Philadelphia for years, so this would not compete with them, but it will do for Pittsburgh :)  The onion rings are huge and beer battered and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Do note, they delivery--an usually faster than the time the predict.  So we enjoy this place: it's close, good on the wallet, and has some unique and decent choices."}
{"text":"I love wings and was so thrilled to see a place that sells mostly wings, and 51 flavors of wings at that. I ordered takeout and the service was great and the food even better. My wings were still crispy when I got home and the honey jalape単o sauce was the bomb. It's exactly what you'd expect, honey with minced jalape単o; it was sweet with a medium spice level. I also very much enjoyed my side of fresh (thin) cut fries.   I absolutely love the variety of sauces here and you bet that I will be here on the regular to try all 51 sauces, but that will be hard considering how much I enjoyed the honey jalape単o!"}
{"text":"We love good wings! These... were not so good. They were okay, but the were a little overly fried and the sauces were unexpected, in a bad way. I wouldn't rule it out for a future visit, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way. The pricing was good, and it seemed exciting that they had all of these different sauces."}
{"text":"The wings I had were way overcooked. I had the garlic parmesan sauce which was basically a pool of butter. The meat itself was dry and crispy and hard to eat. I ordered six but could only eat three before giving up. The Chicken salad wasn't too bad but nothing special.  I don't normally give up on a place too easy, especially a small local business. I just hope to try other food they offer to make up for the first visit."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, we ordered a bunch of wings for a Fouth of July party. The wings were delicious, and they beat the promised delivery time by 2p minutes. We will definitely order from them again(and I will not wait until the nect 4th of July)."}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I order out at least once a week and we try new places a lot. I just finished eating the breaded chicken bowl and it was delicious! Fries are thin and yummy. He got the Cajun wings and he said they're a new fave. Italian hoagie was great. Lady on the phone was kind and helpful. They quoted an hour and showed up in 30 min! Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings and anything buffalo is my jam! If I can add buffalo to it, I will. Chicken wings every night? Yes please! So imagine my excitement when I moved to the area and found out I could have my Buffalo wings DELIVERED to my house! (growing up in the middle of nowhere means you didn't get delivery!)  51 Wings is better than I expected. They have so many flavors and options that it is kinda overwhelming. However every flavor I've tried has been delicious. Even better though is the size and quality of the wings! They are big and meaty, and always stay crispy and hot, even with delivery. They don't skimp on the sauce either!  My go to now is their signature hot. Just enough spice and kick and and all around delicious flavor. I've also tried hot Ranch, spicey gold parm, hot, mild, and garlic parm made hot. Every flavor is super good! I'm sure as I continue to order, I'll try more flavors.  Delivery is usually within the said time and every person I've talked to or delivered has been very nice!  51Wings are what a chicken wing lovers dreams are made of!"}
{"text":"These guys have great food. They've always been friendly and punctual with the food, and the food has always come hot and delicious.  Great little place for wings and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Delivery was timely. Wings were cooked nice and crispy, however they were very skimpy on the sauce."}
{"text":"AMAZING.. Wonton of month was stuffed with turkey and mash potatoes, with side of gravy, ooohh baby!!  And the wings, Extra hott bbq were like you ordered them fresh from your favorite bar and had a  super good kick to them....  Lets just say after this meal, the WONTONS weren't the only thing  STUFFED!!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience was not enjoyable, but we decided to give it another try.  It was much better this time around!  The first time must have been an off night for them because this time the wings were cooked perfectly and the sauces on our wings were delicious.  I am a big fan of the jalepano gold wings.  I also got the chicken gyro which was huge and tasted wonderful.  We tried the old bay ranch, which were good but not to our taste (just our personal taste, we don't eat many things with old bay seasoning so if you love that, you will probably love these, we just wanted to try something different).  We also got the buffalo chicken wontons and the jalepano poppers which were good, but nothing that knocked my socks off.    Over all, I had a much better experience this time and I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Very good wings!!! Always crispy, and their sauces are so good. The jalape単o honey sauce is to die for. Amazing quality for an amazing price!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, we came in to sit and eat, but the place was hot, and no one came over to serve us. However when we ordered to go they were really nice and quick. Got home and the wings were amazing. Defiantly suggest this place. Glad they deliver we won't waste time going in to the store next time!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place a few years back. I'm a wing snob and honestly only love Duff's wings in Buffalo, NY. All others are \"meh\". Well, until I came here. This will be my local wing place. The wings are large, meaty, crispy but not dry, adequate sauce and delicious. They have mastered the fine art of preparing wings and I'm thrilled.   I would have given 5/5 stars but you have to order celery and ranch separately at $1 each and the wings are $13 for 12."}
{"text":"Yummy food with excellent service! Love their honey mustard wings, their wontons, and their tots!! Everything there is excellent!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in the south hills with very good wings.  They are never soggy and always crispy which makes for a great wing.  The sauces are usually pretty good however I'd avoid some.  I once ordered peppercorn ranch and it was literally ranch covered wings with peppercorns on them.  However I am usually very pleased with the sauces.  The regular Buffalo and wet Cajun are my two favorites."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Not only do they have a wide variety (51, in fact) of wing flavors, but the sides and appetizers are on point as well. The fries, tots, and wings are always crispy and never soggy when delivered, a feat not easily accomplished when ordering delivery. Also, the hot cheese balls are a must- delicious!"}
{"text":"So far I have been here 3 times. I've had their honey BBQ wings (anazingggg!), a chicken fries cheese and wing sauce bowl (sounds weird, but is pretty exceptional) and hot pepper cheese balls. I haven't been disappointed yet. Their wings stayed crispy even tho they were drenched in sauce & they definitely didn't go light on the sauce which I like! Hot pepper cheese balls are also amazing, I don't find them in many places and I thoroughly adore them! Also this place has 51 wing sauces including some you won't find a ton of places, a few sirracha flavored ones, jalape単o ranch, and that's just naming a few. You can eat here although I believe take out is far more common.  The only main complaint I have is the ranch dressing, I love ranch and I'm kinda picky about it. Their ranch has decent flavor but is rather runny. All in all not a bad place to get some bar food/game food. After all, it is football season!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love good wings! This place is definitely one of my faves. Right down the street from us in Brentwood, so we can eat in or get delivery.  Not overpriced, and wings are ALWAYS crispy even with sauce.  I bought a full dinner for myself tonight (gyro, wings, nachos -- hey im 9 months Preggo it happens) and it was $15.  Can't beat it! I am obsessed with the honey sriracha wings... Anyone who gives a bad review isn't eating where I am!"}
{"text":"This new place is on 51 and they have 51 flavors of wings! Hence the name. lol. I had the breaded chicken bowl, which was awesome. The ranch/old bay wings were even more awesome! Unique little place! Go!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Got delivery and came within a half hour even though they said it would take an hour."}
{"text":"I've ordered from 51 Wings and Things for a few years now. First when I lived in Castle Shannon and then when I bought a house in West Mifflin I was happy that I was still in their delivery range since their site says they deliver to parts of West Mifflin. Today however I was told that I live on the \"boarder\" of their delivery range and I would have to pay a $3 fee for delivery. After I explained to the girl on the phone that I had ordered and had delivery at this address before she just said sorry that's what my manage said. That's listed no where on their site. I hate silly stuff like this! So that's it for me and 51 Wings."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying 51 Wings. They have a big menu but I was craving wings. The gentleman who waited on me was very nice. I ordered Garlic Butter Parm Wings, Medium Hot wings, and 2 orders of fries. I was taking the food home instead of eating there. I prefer to eat at a restaurant but I had to get home. The gentleman told me that it would be 15-20 mins. That's a good thing because it means they are cooking them fresh. Sure enough, 15 minutes later my order was ready. They smelled wonderful.  I got the wings Home and they were still hot and still crunchy. They were juicy too. There was a lot of butter on the Garlic Butter Parm Wings. A bit much for me, so I drained it all off. Also I had asked for Ranch dressing and they forgot to include it.  The fries were warm but starting to go limp. They are a smaller, thinner fry and I prefer that.  I would definitely order wings again. We really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! These are by far the best wings I've ever had in Pittsburgh!! Awesome service too!"}
{"text":"The variety of different sauce flavors caught my attention but they ended up being pretty awful. The honey jalape単o is literally honey with a jalape単o relish like substance thrown on top. Gross. And the sriracha ranch was a pool of bottle ranch dressing with sriracha drizzled on top in which my wings bathed in. They aren't very innovative so to speak. They're wings are 51 cents on wing night too which is more expensive than most places. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"I go here for wing night on Monday nights!! The wings are just so good and there is so many flavors you just can't choose!! The young woman who works the front desk is just a gem!! She is so sweet and always checks to see if you need anything!! If you haven't tried these wings you must!!! My kids beg me every Monday to go!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted a buffalo chicken salad and decided to get delivery from here.  I was excited that you could get your chicken tossed in any sauce so I just got hot and said wanted ranch dressing and nachos.  The salad was bigger than I was expecting.  I was disappointed in the tossed chicken.  It looked like they just poured hot sauce on top of my salad because I it was everywhere on top.  Then as I was mixing it up the bottom was all watery.  I was checking my receipt and noticed I was charged 50 cents for dressing.  Who orders a salad and it not come with dressing?"}
{"text":"51 Wings sits on Route 51, an area that is experiencing a slow renaissance after years of underdevelopment.   51 Wings' name also refers to the 51 (!) varieties of chicken wings they offer. That they sell no pizza whatsoever is enough to make them a refreshing addition to this long-neglected South Hills corridor.   As we walked in to the grey-walled storefront, we were greeted by a bubbly blonde who was eager to serve us and was tickled to know that we only came because our first choice, Edgar's Authentic Mexican, is closed on Mondays.   Their wings come in oddball quantities of 6,13, 26,and...51! Without much thought, we requested 13 of the Old Bay Ranch flavor and were surprised to get a bowl full of crispy clucker parts that were covered in actual ranch dressing (as opposed to having it served on the side) and dusted with Old Bay after the fact.   A scrumptious mess it was, the chicken remaining brittle and moist despite the nigh-overload of creamy white mother sauce, the aforementioned spice given just enough room to kick me in the tongue.  Kay had a Bowl of the Breaded Chicken persuasion with honey mustard. her meal came in a wooden salad bowl and included fries, mozzarella, a wing sauce and her choice of meat. I had to finish it for her, and found it to be a not-quite-fully-realized type of poutine, not that it tried to be, which is what made this jumble of ideal shoestring fries, tender poultry nuggets, and cheese intriguing and perhaps...accidental?   My Bacon Cheeseburger was doughy, moist, gooey, and rich and tasty all around, the meaty, smoky, severely savory bacon stealing the show from a patty I wished was medium-rare instead of well-done.   From there, we bid the gracious staff adieu and headed towards Sugar & Spice for dessert.   Based on our visit, it would seem that 51 Wings may have...wings, meaning that they deserve a fighting chance. Don't dismiss this part of Pittsburgh. Fly down to Area 51 and get your wing thing on.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzh9WEeRACE  P.S. 51 Wings delivers to Brentwood, Whitehall, Carrick, Overbrook, Brookline, Castle Shannon, Baldwin, Pleasant Hills, and parts of West Mifflin.  P.P.S. The wings we had reminded me favorably of an old recipe I found once for a \"white\" BBQ sauce, its main ingredient being mayonnaise."}
{"text":"51 Wings does have 51 flavors.  Want to try Taco or Old Bay or Garlic or......stop by and order a few.    Darren W is correct, good messy wings!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of wings but finally stopped for the (Friday's during Lent) fish sandwich. You'll be able to make at least 2 and then some from what they give you. I wish they had it all the time. So, since the fish was good, I decided on a return visit to try the 1/2 pound cheeseburger. Surprisingly it's made from fresh unfrozen beef and was way better than what the fast food factories offer. For a 3rd visit, I tried the 1/4 pound bacon wrapped hot dog, and it was again very good. Unlike other reviewer's experiences, the fries on all 3 occasions were not very crispy by the time I got home, but they were fresh cut and more than passable.  Overall, 51 Wings serves up better (and fresher) food than you might expect after trying any or all of the numerous pizza/hoagie shops that line the Rt. 51 corridor. The staff is very friendly and accurate while delivery usually beats estimated times. This is now part of my regular rotation and I look forward to trying more items from the menu, maybe even the wings :)"}
{"text":"I think i ate too many wings. I went there for lunch and skipped dinner. The cajun ranch are my fav. I think Mondays is $.51 wing, eat in only, thats a good deal.  favorite wing place in Baldwin!  You'll see my face again!"}
{"text":"They have many varieties of wings and they were very good.  Even with the 20 min ride home, they were still crisp and flavorful.  I expected a huge wait because it was right before the Steeler -Kansas City playoff game, but they were prepared.  Great wings. we had the hot and sweet and the garlic butter parm.....yummy.  Will be back."}
{"text":"That this place was going to be good from the one person I know that has been there.  It wasn't. $4.99 for 6 small split wings is stupid. The sauce wasn't any better. $7.99 for an Italian hogie, rip off. Will not be going back here.  Suggest you don't either"}
{"text":"Had the mild chicken tenders lunch special!!! It was so good. From the suite 251 crew. Thanks y'all for always delivering to us!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Best wings in the area!!! Quick and friendly service clean and reasonably priced!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered a buffet of food to share between our family as we watched the Pirates game. The order arrived in 50 minutes, within the 45-60 minute time frame we were given. The food was hot and crisp. We ordered two 13 piece wings, one with honey garlic sauce and one with spicy garlic. The honey garlic were really good, but the garlic flavor wasn't very present. Either way, wings slathered in honey are delicious. The spicy garlic were pretty much what I expected; moderately hot with a strong garlic flavor. We really enjoyed those as well. We also ordered the beer battered onion rings, hot pepper cheese balls, fried ravioli, mac and cheese bites. All of the appetizer items were dusted with Parmesan cheese, which we loved. The beer battered onion rings were big and crisp, I really enjoyed them. I didn't try the mac and cheese bites or fried ravioli so no opinion there but my husband and son liked them. The hot cheese balls were great as well, crisp enough and the cheese was good texture. A+ overall, we will definitely be ordering again and trying new sauces."}
{"text":"Fantastically awesome. Best sauce I've had in a long time. Try peppercorn ranch, so good. Steak hoagie is filling. Bowls are good. Such good food please try it!!"}
