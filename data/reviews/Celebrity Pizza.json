{"text":"We drive past this place all of the time. Decided to get take out this past weekend. My family and I really enjoyed our pizza and breadsticks with cheese!  I liked the sweeter taste of the sauce.  Staff was super friendly! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered Wings and 1 Med Pizza. The pizza was good and hot, but the wings were wormed over microwaved. I was not happy with atmosphere of business. When I entered to pick up pizza and wing order I smelled a slight bad Oder."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from this place for several years and have never had an issue with the quality of the pie or service. I love the fact that it's family owned and practically in my back yard. The prices are on par with most pizza places and they are more than willing to make substitutions when asked."}
{"text":"If you like thick bready pizza with a bland taste this is the place for you."}
