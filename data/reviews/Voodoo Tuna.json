{"text":"Being a fan of sushi, I couldn't wait for this place to open. I've eaten there twice now, once in the restaurant and once ordering take away and I have to say the food is delicious. The sushi is anything but 'traditional', so if you're looking for the authentic sushi bar experience this isn't it. That said the rolls are large and flavorful, so there is value behind the higher than average per roll price. The drinks are also fun and inventive. The server on our visit was competent, and the food was brought in a timely fashion. I'd eat here again, though I prefer a more traditional take on sushi.  Overall, I'm over the whole Nouveau Asian Fusion trend. But if Asian Fusion 2.0 is what you're looking for, Voodoo Tuna is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Wish I would have looked at yelp reviews prior to going...all in all, the sushi was bad, the veggie roll was inedible, as it had so much sweet chili sauce, and yes it was $15 for a veggie roll. Maybe I should have said something while I was there, but didn't want to make a fuss.  2 stars as opposed to one, because it was good service, just not good food."}
{"text":"I don't often leave reviews, I don't complain to service or management, I just learn from the experience and direct my business to companies which deserve it. But this place was so thoroughly disappointing that it motivated me to share my thoughts.   In almost every way I can think of I could give negative marks to Voodoo. I don't need to list them all, and it is mostly just repeating what has already been said. The one detail, which should have been our clue to leave; when they brought the menu they also brought us glasses of water. After a sip of water we agreed that it tasted funky, after a little speculation we settled on the ice cubes as the cause. What ever freezer they use to store the ice also must have older fish and it has burdened the ice with a foul flavor. We ignored this sign and attempted to make the most of il our dinner.   What followed was embarrassing- how does a SUSHI shop not know how to cook Rice?  We couldn't force ourselves to finish the food we ordered, payed and thanked our waitress, and left... Never to return."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying sushi and I was highly surprised with my visit. I enjoyed it! The happy hour is Amazing!! I will definitely be coming again for the delicious spring rolls!!! My new favorite!"}
{"text":"Went to Voodoo for dinner and had the best food and service. Joe the owner gave some recommendations and it was awesome. The tuna nachos were best ever. Loved the atmosphere and people that worked there. If you are in area a must stop if in area. Happy hour everyday is great. We are definitely coming in for late night happy hour 10-2am every night. Made reservation for beef dinner in February can't wait. The sake selection on of the best bang for the buck. So if in area please stop in and see local guys doing great local work.."}
{"text":"Looking back, I'm not sure why I waited 45 minutes for a table. The lighting here is weird, and the food isn't much better. My crawfish buns were served on a bed of Walmart bag-o-lettuce: I think it was garnish, but, whatever. One simple spicy tuna roll took 40+ minutes to arrive, and then finally appeared without soy sauce or the SOY SAUCE VESSELS. Overpriced, too. The highlight was the hot chick openly breastfeeding in the middle of the packed dining room (pointed out to me by my girlfriend, I might add).  Pity, too, because I love the Asia-meets-bayou concept. They should add a disappointment roll (to-go only)."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi spot in Cleveland. My first time there I tried the steam buns. Second time around, I opted for the sushi. Both were amazing and tasted so fresh. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my expectations were low coming here but I was very wrong. I came during happy hour and we got great quality food for our money spent. They had great beer options to start out with. We ordered a couple half off appetizers and they were all very good. The sushi was very fresh and did not disappoint like some of these other sushi bars around. I will be back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was mildly disappointed by the salmon sashimi. It wasn't very good, and the portion of seaweed salad was teeny. The tofu buns were rather okay but still not wow worthy. I was also saddened to learn that a simple avocado roll was out of the question."}
{"text":"Brief synopsis... I come here weekly. Dave makes the most amazing cocktails, I always have awesome service and the food is great. The staff is amazing and best Creme brûlée in the city!! If you haven't been, you're missing out! The miso soup is also to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is most definitely underrated.  The staff is all very friendly. The sushi is AMAZING, and the atmosphere is pretty relaxing. This place is also great for happy hour! Great deals that I believe are from 4-7pm Monday-Friday!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this week, and I less than impressed. When we walked in, I was happy with the chill vibe. We sat down at the bar and ordered some drinks and food fairly fast.  The bartenders were attentive, hard working, and didn't see them standing around whatsoever. Plus the drinks they were making were very entertaining. I was very pleased with the bartenders overall.   When the sushi came after about an hour, they had a great presentation. That's about it. The rice was hard and the avocado was mushy (means it's not fresh). I almost didn't finish my 12 rolls because it was hard to put down. Not much about the sushi was rave worthy. I would not recommend getting sushi here."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Humble on August 1 but decided to give Voodoo Tuna a try instead. Our first obstacle was figuring out how to enter through the patio area. Once we got that down we were promptly seated on the gorgeous patio. Whomever designed it did a very nice job if you don't count the poor entrance choice. The flower planters were at eye level that gave the whole patio and intimate feeling all while being on the busiest street in Lakewood.   I am vegan and my wife is vegetarian so we were happy to see some options on the menu for us both. Unfortunately, the two dishes I was most interested in, the peanut bowl and the veggie steam bun, couldn't be made vegan because of the ingredients in the sauces. So if you are vegan you are very limited.  We started off with drinks after having our server explain each of them to us. I ordered the Tokyo Mule and my wife had the Voodoo Mai Tai which bubbled when it arrived. I liked my drink especially since it was served in a proper mule mug. My wife thought her's was good but we both thought they were very expensive, mine $10 - hers $12. Last I checked we were still in Lakewood not Manhattan.    For an appetizer we ordered edamame $6. The large portion was good but strangely served with a bowl of soy sesame sauce that was sickly sweet.   We also ordered the Sushi Roulette $12, which we thought would be fun. They were willing to alter it to make it vegan which was nice. The concept is that there is one piece of sushi that is super spicy. The person who gets it, gets to drink the saki that comes on the plate. The sushi pieces were tiny and each was covered in another too sweet sauce. The other disappointing thing was the spice was literally just a large blob of wasabi inside one of the pieces. My wife lost on the first piece, to bad for her.   For our main dish we each ordered a veggie roll $6 each. These were exactly what was served to us for the roulette with the same sweet sauce on top but instead of the rice on the outside it was inside. The size of each piece was smaller than the width of my thumb.   We spent over $50 here and left feeling like we just ate an appetizer. We ended up going to Rozi's for a drink after then a real plate of food at Melt after that. I realize it might be different if we ate meat but based on the other reviews on Yelp of this place I doubt it.   We were very disappointed overall other than we liked our server. She was attentive and mostly knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. We also loved the patio which I think is really the best thing about this place. Overall, I can't recommend this place to anyone. If I want sushi I will go downtown to Sushi 86 or Parma to Mizu. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We visited voodoo the opening week.  Our server was friendly and helped us with the Menu.  The menu is huge! We started with the lobster nachos and also Ordered a philly roll, Lakewood roll, and the bacon roll.  The lobster nachos were amazing.  I would return for these alone. As for the sushi neither of us were overly impressed.  The philly roll was the worst I have ever had but the Lakewood roll and bacon roll were decent.  The prices were high for the quality.  If you are looking for good sushi I would highly recommend Ohashi in North Olmsted.    We may return to Voodoo in the future to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Went this evening for happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed. Nice variety of rolls in the half price selection!! Lakewood roll and crab Rangoon highly recommended. Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"There are some places that do vegetarian sushi very well - but this is not one of them. They do have vegetarian options - but these do not taste much better than grocery store sushi or asian noodles you can throw together at home. Definitely not worth the menu price. I hope the non-vegetarian food is better."}
{"text":"Excited to finally get sushi back in Lakewood, but was a bit disappointed.  Atmosphere is nice, and we sat at the bar. Our service was poor however. Server ignored us for 10 minutes before even saying hello.   The potstickers were tasty, but the rolls were surprisingly bland. The banana unagi was interesting but the yellowtail and octopus has no flavor. Overpriced for quality and portion size. Drinks were fine.   Might give it another shot, but they are missing a huge opportunity here"}
{"text":"Service was just mehhhh. They surprised me with the app, it was delicious! Sushi rolls where good but the ramen noodles where totally undercooked and chalky the flavor profile was spot on but it was extremely spicy ( I love spicy but not to the extreme) so it affected my experience.  The broth on the ramen was cold to make it worst"}
{"text":"Had an awesome date night here everything on the menu was delicious! Definitely not your typical sushi rolls great environment highly recommend for a night out. I don't think I'll do the sake flight again though wasn't a huge fan of the flavored sake."}
{"text":"Over 30 mins for pad Thai and a sushi roll ... REALLY get it together ! They only had 4 tables in the place and it still took forever to get food. This is the second time this has happened I won't be returning !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the lakewood area. Sushi is always fresh and drinks are well priced. I have a shellfish allergy, and there are many veggie and fish options, and they are willing to make substitutions. My favorite is the lakewood roll (with salmon subsitute). We have done takeout as well, and the sushi is just as good."}
{"text":"Over priced beyond belief. Terribly bland sushi. Waited forever to get served. Sat at a table for 15min before our waitress came over with water and greeted us. Very pushy about the cocktails that they serve. And theyre very underwhelming. Nothing positive about this experience at all. In no way shap or form would i ever go here again or every recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been a bit apprehensive to try Voodoo Tuna because of all the other reviews but I have to say that I had a great experience. I went for Happy Hour which is killer here. It is from 4-7pm and it's half off all appetizers and 6 piece sushi rolls! What better way to try a place than at HH where you can try multiple things without breaking the bank. I ordered 3 sushi rolls, an order of the edamame and 2 mixed drinks and my bill was under $30! Now that's a steal!   There are a few things I do have to say about this place. I do not think their sushi is the best in town but it's still good. I did try one of their unique rolls and didn't care for it and I will stick to the traditional rolls. I would not come here and eat if it were not happy hour because I do think their menu is over priced. Their cheapest 8 piece roll is $14! That's quite hefty! With that said, I absolutely loved the staff and my bartender. Everyone was incredibly friendly. The bartender made me a special drink that wasn't on the menu and it was one of the best drinks I have had in a long time; tasty and strong!   Overall, my experience was great and that will make me recommend their happy hour to my friends."}
{"text":"We went her for Valentine's dinner. We had some great dishes first the chicken lemongrass potstickers which was an instant comfort food but light and refreshing.  There were specials and we ordered the chef's special for 2. We got a fried oyster roll, a FUTOMAKI  roll, two URAMAKI rolls, 4 NIGIRI, and 2 sashimi with seaweed salad. All were chef's choice. We were not disappointed! Surprisingly my favorite was the surf and turf followed by spicy tuna. Our server Victoria was so nice and attentive. She explained all the rolls since we are noobs."}
{"text":"Never will I order from here again... I got it delivered (a large order) and the manager or owner started angrily texting me from his personal phone after I called the restaurant to complain my order was 20min late and his driver said he was lost and couldn't get to me (he ended up finding it). beyond unprofessional."}
{"text":"I'm extremely bummed that I didn't fall in love with Voodoo Tuna. REALLY bummed. I was over the moon with excitement at having sushi (potentially good sushi!) in Lakewood. Sadly, like my desire to have runway model-type legs, it was not to be.  My disappointments are summarized as follows:  1. Too pricey for the quality that is served. As far as the sushi goes, these are Ginko prices, but the quality is grocery store rolls. There are so many items on the menu that require a WTF on the pricing. A $15 (veggie) roll with tofu and no seafood. Get out of town. I could say that about 85% of the menu pricing. I know they have to pay start up costs and rent and all kinds of stuff, but the cost isn't reasonable for what is served.   2. I'm not impressed with what I've eaten. It's a bummer. The sushi is okay but I can't say much more than that. The other non-sushi items I've had were the same. For rolls, the star of the show should be the seafood first, then complimented with other stuff in/on a roll. Here, the seafood/fish seems like an afterthought with bacon, tempura everything, potstickers etc. i did try some of the more traditional type rolls and they were bland. Nothing I've had made me want to return for more. And the high prices don't make it easy to say \"what the heck, I'll try this xxxx roll and see how it is.\"   I sincerely hope that the powers that be at Voodoo Tuna are paying attention to what people are saying and are going to implement some changes. Even though I have some negative things to say about the place, I DO want it to succeed. I want to gush over how good their food is.  The waitstaff was pretty nice and my beers/cocktails were delicious but I'd love to see a few less costly drinks on the menu.   Rooting for Voodoo Tuna! I'm hopeful and will go back."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I felt it was necessary. I've finally got my boyfriend to enjoy sushi and went to the opening of Voodoo Tuna and suggested it tonight as someone told me they have a happy hour 4-7. Afraid I would miss it, I called in advance to make reservations, while asking about the happy hour. They reserved us a table, which apparently is not included in their happy hour special. ?   It seemed as though they got busy right at the time we came in as 5 min after we were seated the restaurant was packed. The host was nice enough to bring us water until the waiter could get to us. Tommy took our appetizer order fairly quickly however it took a lengthy time to get our appetizers. The host filled our water again as we waited, my seat was the first near the kitchen and I can see prepared food ready at the window. I saw our order sit for 7 minutes before a line cook asked the host to run the food. Thinking it wasn't ours as the order included lobster nachos they brought this over to us, they got half of our order correct. Left the edamame beans that were now room temperature and put in our actual order in.  Tommy came around later to apologize for the mix up and brought out the other appetizer. Our sushi order came quickly however then the check came, which obviously didn't include the half off happy hour but did include the lobster nachos. We questioned it and Tommy was gracious enough to discount the meal, leaving the nachos, but we were thankful he did so and truthfully wanted to get out. I hope the host gets tips from staff as we saw him more than our server."}
{"text":"Came with my daughter,  had  a great time.  Atmosphere was cool, TV a for games,  food was great.  Coming back with customers."}
{"text":"I heard this place just opened, so I thought I would check it out.  I have been longing for Lakewood to get a sushi place again since the owner of Sakura closed and opened a place in Westlake called Arashi, which is a little too far for me to go on a whim.  Voodoo Tuna markets themselves as \"asian fusion\" and so they have a more adventurous menu than some more traditional sushi places.  Some of the menu did look pretty interesting, and I may come back and check out their exclusives sometime.    However, they are quite expensive when it comes to basics -- I was charged $8 for plain salmon maki rolls that I can get pretty much anywhere else for $5-6.  And they weren't out of the ordinary, or giant portions.  I also waited over 45 minutes from ordering to being served, which is an extraordinarily long wait for three simple sushi rolls. Granted, they seemed busy, but I hope that's not typical. The bartender apologized several times for the wait, which was appreciated, but that's really too long to wait for an order.    Unfortunately I was not very impressed, and I wouldn't have minded if their prices were more in line with what other sushi places cost, but for their prices I was disappointed.  I would still recommend checking it out if you like sushi and are looking for something different, you may find it more to your liking than I did.    For a nearby alternative, Brown Sugar Thai recently started offering sushi, and hardly ever seem to be busy."}
{"text":"What a difference a year makes! The service was quick and accurate, and the menu has been drastically improved too. Starters and some rolls are half off during happy hour which makes it even better.  I did have a few gripes, though. The lobster nachos weren't as good as I thought they would be, and my fiancée wasn't thrilled with the cut of salmon she got for her sashimi. I also dislike the fact that the happy hour specials only apply if you're sitting at one of the bars. Otherwise, though, they've definitely turned things around. I'm glad I gave them another shot."}
{"text":"It's actually hilarious to read the low star reviews on Voodoo Tuna. One of them is actually a guy writing about HOW HE LOST HIS OWN SUNGLASSES AND BELIEVES THE STAFF STOLE THEM-nothing about the food-KEEP IT TOGETHER MAN! ANOTHER IS A ABOUT A DELIVERY ORDER that was late or didn't make it or something- SHE LEFT ONE STAR-nothing about the food. They are a new business haven't you ever had a bad night or made a mistake?  The sushi I had at Voodoo Tuna was great! I've eaten at Nobu, Tao, tons of fancy schmancy sushi places in NYC and Voodoo Tuna can definitely hold their own with some of the best of them! I can't even see where people didn't like it, maybe they haven't been to as many sushi places as I have to make a decent comparison. I've had shitty sushi before and this is definitely not in that category.  When I went about 2 weeks ago my food was amazing! I had the miso soup and did the \"create your own roll\" menu I believe it was only $7 to choose your own ingredients in a sushi roll. That's like creating your own Special Roll for ONLY $7. I had never been to a sushi place where they let you concoct your own sushi roll and I thought it was so fun!   I do agree that special sushi rolls or chefs rolls at restaurants are pricey-that's a no brainier!!! But there is so much to order and the prices range from cheap to expensive just like every menu at every sushi place I've ever been too.   I love how people get high and mighty when they write Yelp reviews and are so quick to write bad reviews when they aren't even considering what it does to a new business. How about experience a place more than once or order some varying menu items before you give a shit review to a restaurant. Give Voodoo Tuna a chance and take advantage of the \"create your own feature\" I don't think you'll be disappointed!   Also our server was amazing he had awesome slicked back hair but I forgot his name?!"}
{"text":"Finding good sushi in Cleveland is hard, but finding sushi rolls that are out of the ordinary is even harder. Voodoo is consistently my go-to for sushi because they switch up their maki rolls so much. The Crav Rangoon one is my personal favorite, but they are literally ALL good. Visit during their happy hour for a great deal on drinks and rolls."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I went here late after work on one night.  We had by far the BEST server we've ever had there. ( I feel terrible I don't remember her name, cute girl reddish brown hair below her shoulders works at 5 pm daily ) Our drinks were never empty, she brought us everything we needed. The food came out in a very timely manner, hot, with great presentation.   It sounds silly but they have some of the BEST French fries there, those are one of my favorites! The sushi was great and two of my friends loved their ramen bowls.  At the end she asked us about dessert- being super full we all said NO at first.  Then one person said \" maybe we will see the menu \" so she listed the items for us and within minutes we had 2 delicious desserts at our table.  She made them sound good how could we say no?  The cream brûlée sampler - OH MY GOD. All three were delicious and very unique.  Then there is the cheesecake... wow. I know you wouldn't think of a sushi place being the top spot for dessert but both were amazing and we will be back ASAP.  ( I also feel like it is very clean inside which is huge! ) They also are on uber eats which is my new favorite thing!"}
{"text":"Loved the lobster nachos the banana rolls are also amazing the place fills up with locals fast so it's smart to get a reservation the later you go the better the chance they are out of oysters or other menu items. Parking in the back is convenient for Lakewood. Didn't have to park on the street and walk blocks away or anything. Overall great sushi a little pricey for sushi but delicious."}
{"text":"Americans love the taste of sugar, or that's at least what 99% of Asian dishes tell me.  Too much sugar in these apps, but the Crab Rangoon Roll was Japan meets the state fair.  Lobster nachos (app) were crispy and light, drizzled with a sugary dark topping. The chips were better than the dip itself minus the drizzle. Not a bad little patio option with an ever changing street side table view of Detroit."}
{"text":"Second time. My experience the second time around was much better. Service and quality of the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Been there 2 times, dinner and happy hour. Both times the sushi rice was stale and sauces were bland. Menu on the website did not match the one in the restaurant. Good selection for happy hour though, even though food just ok and not worth the regular prices beyond happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing! I love Unagi, it's the ugliest of the sushis but the yummiest. I tried the Unagi Banana sushi bc a bartender at Melt recommended it once. Sooo glad I tried it. Their sushi is fresh and the perfect size. The owner was going around and talking to all the guests, very pleasant man. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit and certainly will not be our last. We went on a busy Saturday evening and were promptly sat after only a 5 minute wait.  Our server was attentive and knowledgable, but not in a generic way.  We split 4 rolls and they were ready in around 10 minutes. The crab rangoon roll and tsunami roll were perfect. They also had an autumn duck roll on special that looked incredible.   All in all this was a great mix of service and sushi. To walk in on a weekend and have sushi in front of me so quickly I'll gladly pay $18 for a premium foto maki roll.  Go to this place often. The rolls are so good I want to freeze them in the winter and skate on them...then melt them in the spring and eat them!"}
{"text":"I had the Lakewood roll which I thought was very good. We had a 8 person party so we played the sushi roulette it's something I hadn't ever seen before and was fun! I hate cucumber and they were very good with letting me sub that for more avocado in the rolls- also told me you could customize any roll. Was surprised to see other negative reviews only bad thing I could say was the wait on sushi was pretty long (they said 35 mins more like 45). I am not a huge sushi person though so may not be the best judge."}
{"text":"I thought this place was fun, trendy and priced well!  They have a Happy Hour which is always fun to take advantage of.  I missed the Happy Hour but will be returning to try it!  The menu is simple but has a lot of fun, creative choices.  The shishito peppers were delicious!  Coconut shrimp very good.  Our sushi was fantastic and different from the traditional rolls, which I enjoyed.  The steam buns are great as well!  I will definitely return and introduce new people to this place!"}
{"text":"The only disappointing component of my trip to Cleveland last week was this restaurant. What can I say that hasn't already been said in other reviews? I returned the miso soup because it genuinely tasted like gym socks soaked in water. Seriously. This is not a joke. Order it if you dare. The sushi was just ok. The only reason I gave the place two stars is because the server was relatively friendly and the pork belly ramen was acceptable. The experience was definitely not worth the price I paid, and if I lived in the region, I definitely wouldn't be coming back. It's a shame, too, because that's a very cool part of town and a solid sushi restaurant would flourish up there. Something definitely needs to change about this place. I don't know how it'll stay in business with these consistently bad reviews."}
{"text":"Got there at 9 on a Friday the place was packed. It was an hour and a half wait time to be seated. Took an hour to get our food once we ordered which was 3 sushi rolls. The sushi is average,nothing special at all. The bartenders were extremely friendly and cool. The Gin Gin I ordered was very good. The hostess on the other hand was very very rude,surprised she landed the job to greet customers. The place has only been open a week,in no hurry to go back. We'll try it again in 4 months see if they listen to customer complaints and suggestions. Do yourself a favor and go to the East Side at Lure Bistro for some amazing fresh sushi done right. Tuesdays is half price night there."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and service.  Shrimp Po Boy Bun and Crab Rangoon Roll were delicious."}
{"text":"Unique Asian inspired fusion combinations!  I really loved the crab rangoon maki rolls & the shrimp po oy steamed buns!  Great atmosphere & patio dining is available."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for sushi. After making my rounds at almost every sushi spot in the area, I was excited to add a newcomer into my rotation. A quick look at the inventive and playful menu online and I booked us reservations for Friday night. I'll start by saying, there was nothing wrong with our visit to Voodoo Tuna, its just that nothing was exceptionally great about it. There were some high points, to be sure, but overall our dining experience was a little underwhelming.   For starters, the atmosphere was great. Very modern and hip (do people still say hip?), without being pretentious. Our server was friendly, informative and attentive the entire meal. The cocktail menu was great. Some of the cocktails were a bit over complicated in my opinion, so I ended up settling for a vodka and their homemade ginger beer. The ginger beer was delicious and I was delighted to know they make a lot of their cocktail ingredients in house.   The food is really where my expectations were let down. We started with the shishito peppers and the vegetable spring rolls. The peppers were good, but needed to be charred more, some of them were very raw. The spring rolls were good, but nothing special. I found it a little odd that both appetizers were served with the same sticky sweet sauce. The sauce was drizzled over everything, so it all just became very one note.   Our apps filled us up, so we went with the Green Roll and the Vegetable steam buns to share for our entrees. The Green Roll was the biggest disappointment to me. Sushi was the sole reason for us coming here, and I found the sushi rice to have a very gummy consistency. There was also a really weird flavor to the roll, I couldn't put my finger on exactly what it was, but I only ate two bites and couldn't stomach another. I've never had that reaction to sushi before, so I can't figure out what tasted so weird. However, the veggie steam buns were phenomenal. The actual bun was the best I've had in awhile. The tempura veggies were crisp and the pickled veggies added a perfect bite. These I would absolutely order again.   I'm good at giving second chances, so I'd come back to Voodoo Tuna. The weird sushi experiences will probably have me trying something besides sushi, but they do have a great selection of noodle bowls and entrees. Heck, I might just order those steam buns again and call it a day."}
{"text":"Our server was more concerned about her ex boyfriend being there than taking our order. She described how she hadnt seen him in forver. And she was sorry for not coming to take our order. I had to ask someone else if they could, and they walked up to her and had to tell her we were waiting. Weird. I was excited to try it out, food was decent but the staff...nope."}
{"text":". Wanted to like this cool spot, but a 15 minute wait for our appetizer ( lobster nachos) and 30 minutes for 3 sushi rolls, an Udon soup and a seafood salad. 3 tables were seated after us and were served before us. No explanations or apology from our server. Appetizers and entrees were literally dropped with a plunk on the table, $18 sushi served with HOT dishes straight from the dishwasher. We asked the owner why service took so long and he launched into how each roll is hand made .....but bad no response to surrounding tables served before us. Other than sorry and a $25 coupon offer, we declined since we won't be back.  We arrived at 630p on a Friday night and left after 8p without drinks or dessert. Interesting food but poorly trained wait staff."}
{"text":"Came here with the small bites club and the food was AMAZING!!!! I have been meaning to come here since I saw them at the Lakewood event in the summer. Presentation is beautiful in a simple way.  Kudos to Derek for putting this together and showing us what Voodoo Tuna has to offer!!!!"}
{"text":"The 1st time I've ever had potstickers so crispy. but they were great. This place puts a delicious spin on so many top dishes. The steam buns are awesome little meat clouds. My favorite roll is probably the crab rangoon. The drinks are well put together, with a kick.  Well done."}
{"text":"The service was great even though the place was packed.  The sushi menu is fun and interesting.  I would definitely  recommend the Jamaican bacon roll.  If you have never tried sushi before this is the place to try it.  Next time I go I'm going to try some of their appetizers."}
{"text":"The sushi to be nice is subpar compared to other restaurants. Not the best quality for the price unless you go for happy. The service is excellent, really nice and always welcoming but again, the sushi is not good. I guess I can't complain since the chiefs are clearly not trained. If this is your last choice for sushi I would tell you to just go for something else."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like voodoo tuna. Unfortunately, I placed a large $60 order and when I got home the boxes were not even marked! They put all of the rolls together in the same box! What if we had allergies and you just combined all of the food!? Not only that, the rolls were falling apart and the sushi itself was not that good. Please save your money and take your business elsewhere. I don't know how this place is still open! When I spoke to the manager I feel like the comments were semi accusatory about it being my fault. I wasn't aware that by placing a big order I had to specify to label the rolls? How would you know what sushi roll was what? I also have eaten sushi multiple times- pretty sure I know how to use chopsticks. I would have been completely happy with a refund! I'll even bring back the food- because we didn't finish it!"}
{"text":"Location is great, interior is very modern, staff were all very hipster and friendly which fits the neighborhood well. Unfortunately the quality of the sushi doesnt match the great decor. I got 2 specialty rolls for $17 each. At that price I expected better quality than what I got. Everything tasted bland and not fresh. Overall quite disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst dining in experiences I have ever had. The service was terrible, the staff was screaming at one another, it was so disorganized and felt very uncomfortable. The food was overpriced and not worth your time or money, go anywhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I think it's hard to find good sushi in Ohio. Voodoo has great sushi and the prices are reasonable. The design and setting of the restaurant itself is very modern and comfortable. My visit was in the early afternoon and there was parking across the street. I would imagine parking on Detroit on the weekend is a pain in the butt, but still it's probably worth it because the sushi here is good, and the restaurant has a nice, trendy vibe."}
{"text":"Trying too hard  Just okay  some good deals on drinks  I would prefer grocery store sushi over it  likely won't return  the lakewood sushi market is still open"}
{"text":"So I'm new to the area but I've been an avid sushi lover for years. I ordered Salmon Nigiri, a Crunchy California and Miso soup. Although the miso soup and the Crunchy California were fine the Salmon Nigiri was .... old. Let me be clear for those that don't know what it is. It's raw salmon atop a bed of rice. Most amateur sushi people don't jump straight to nigiri. The rice was dry and lacking all moisture like it was yesterday's leftover refrigerated rice. The salmon had actually hardened near the edges of the roll due to exposure to the air. I also suspect that's why they were \"bound\" with a thin strip of seaweed (it helped hold the roll together). After eating at no less than 30 sushi places in a lifetime, I've yet to see that. Never eating here again. And I recommend you not either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Lakewood and We decided to try Voodoo Tuna after all the hype on this restaurant. We got the sake flight which was delicious! We got miso soup I got sushi and my boyfriend got the steam buns and a noodle udon dish. All of the dishes were your typical asian infused dishes . Although the miso soup wasn't the best,  will defiantly not get it next time we visit. It wasn't awful, but we probably won't  be back for a while."}
{"text":"Being that this restaurant is fairly new, I didn't know what to expect upon visiting. When you walk in the door, the atmosphere is very casual. In fact the walls were void of decoration and the seating and floors looked like what you'd expect from a fast casual restaurant.   Upon opening the menu, I was surprised to see the prices of the food. Entrées were in the $26-42 range, soup bowls were $16, and  basic sushi was $3-4 more expensive than at any other place in the area. When I see Asian Fusion restaurants charging these prices, I expect the atmosphere to match.   Needless to say the food was nothing special, and even if it was half the price it still wouldn't have been worth it. The ramen noodle bowl was essentially salt water with ramen and meat and 3 mushrooms tossed in for the low low price of $16.   This place will likely have to overhaul their menu or decor in the near term if they want to make it."}
{"text":"This place had to have undergone a major makeover based on previous reviews.  My wife and I went there a few weekends ago and were blown away by the quality and taste of the food.  We wanted go try a little of everything on the menu and designed our meal accordingly: We had ... House Wakame - not bad at all, good flavor, my wife loved it Chicken Lemongrass Potstickers - The best starter I've had in a long time, this was delicious Veggie Spring Rolls - These were also exceptional, the Thai Chili sauce was very good Veggie Uramaki Roll - This was very good and looked gorgeous Apple Yakitori Chicken Steam Buns - Amazing, the pear set off this dish perfectly Pork Belly Sliders - ORDER THESE, this was my favorite thing we ordered Voodoo Ramen - This was very tasty, it was too spicy for my wife but she's not a fan of spicy  We split all dishes and the services was fast and friendly.  Even though it's about 50 minutes away from us we will definitely head back up again."}
{"text":"Soooo bad! You have got to be kidding me grocery store sushi is better than this. I don't even know where to begin.  Arrived, sat at bar, ordered drinks, waited fifteen minutes before drinks arrived. In the meantime, constantly harassed by server asking if we were ready to order. Apparently in the fast food approach to sushi you should be prepared to order drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert at the same time. Once served, the tempura was definitely not tempura, everything was dripping in some sort of weird sauce, and I took the entire roll apart and couldn't find the unagi in my unagi roll. Seriously, go some place else and order a burger. I'm not a sushi snob or anything but this place was terrible."}
{"text":"Sushi was not very fresh. Pricy for the quality of sushi and presentation. Unfortunate that there are no other sushi restaurants in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Would the phrase 'colossal disappointment' be overstating it? I am a huge Cleveland fan, and among the top reasons why is the city's culinary scene. As a Lakewood resident, one genre that's been missing, though, is sushi. I was so excited when I heard Voodoo was opening here, and I counted down the days until I could try it.  And then I did. :/  If you can navigate the entrance (we counted six parties who all made the same mistake as we did), you'll probably find that the service is fine -- not remarkable, mind you, but fine by Lakewood hipster standards. And if you're like us, the menu will raise an eyebrow. The big disappointment will hit home, however, when the pre-frozen veggie egg rolls or when the sushi rolls -- which I would guess are 50% rice, if not more -- are placed in front of you. To boot, the fish itself (yellowtail, to be specific) was not at all fresh and, as a lover of raw fish, just not enjoyable. I would equate their rolls to a plastic-boxed $6 sushi offering at your local grocery store.  On the bright side, this gives us a closer location to get some good sake.  Lakewood is rife with foodies, so it's probably not the best place to trial an underwhelming sushi joint. Up your game, Voodoo, and we will be frequent patrons."}
{"text":"Sushi was average at best - service was decent, ambiance was good. A lot of rice, not much fish, and the drinks were expensive. I would recommend going there during happy hour or for an appetizer but they really need to step their sushi game up."}
{"text":"I'm kind of on the fence between 3 and 4 stars with this place. They do have a really good happy hour which offers up half price sushi & half price appetizers which is a very good value, only if you're seated at the bar or patio, though. The shishito pepper appetizer is huge, and it's only like $3 during happy hour. The sushi is good, but I would have a tough time paying full price during non-happy hour. Nice rotational selection of draft beer and decent cocktails."}
{"text":"AMAZING HAPPY HOUR!!! 1/2 apps and a large section of the sushi rolls.  The mussels app is awesome for only $6 you can't beat that.  We ha e tried all the sushi rolls and they're all great.  Everyone who works there is really nice too.   Update: I've been back twice since my first time; when I wrote the review.  The mussels were great the first time.  We got them to more time since and they haven't been as good.  The sauce isn't red and just more buttery than red curry.  Tonight tuna roll didn't have much flavor.  The veggie roll is still awesome though!!   Kinda on the fence if we will go back.  Happy hour is cheap and we will probably only return for the that. Wouldn't pay full price for the food here."}
{"text":"best sushi in lkwd! crab rangoon & lakewood rolls are my FAVORITE! happy hour has amazing deals... how do you beat $4-$5 for a roll?! love sitting at the bar..relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"My review only concerns the food and delivery (ya'll know I'm the take-out queen).   Overall I've enjoyed my food experiences with Voodoo Tuna. I'd say it lays between Giant Eagle sushi and Ginko. So think: fresh, a little uniqueness, a little pricey.   *Jamaican Bacon $9 - The smallest of the rolls I got. Good idea, just would be better if they added some spice to the rice maybe; it just needs a little something extra to make it pop. *Lakewood Roll $10 - To me this was like a good standard roll you can't go wrong with. Nothing special, but A-Ok!   *Lobster Nachos $16 - Liked that the dip came in a container big enough to make the price worth it. I'm guessing 2 cups or so of dip. Texture was thin sauce with chunks of meat and such. Tasted good.  *Rise n' Shine $15 - Very tasty! I really enjoyed this a lot! The flavors worked well together.  *Voodoo Pad Thai $14 - Not bad at all. Had some spicy heat to it. Would probably focus on other menu items in the future though.  *Fried Calamari $11 - Breaded with crushed graham crackers and served with a coconut curry dip. At first you'll think it's odd, but you won't be able to stop eating it. I enjoyed this.   Confusion with take-out: They put the sauces on the side or forget them completely. I think it would be better to just stick the little sauce cup inside the container with the dish it goes with. That way I'm not guessing what sauce goes with what nor am I crying because I don't have any sauce.   Also to be noted, I would have rated Voodoo Tuna higher, but the prices on UberEats were a dollar more for each item when compared to the Voodoo Tuna website. When I inquired about this I was told that UberEats takes a cut so they increased prices to make up for that. To me this puts Voodoo Tuna in a bit of a negative greedy light (Uber as well for taking my $5 fee and taking from the restaurant too). They are still making a profit even if it is lower than what they would prefer. They are getting business that they would not otherwise be getting. When compared to other Asian restaurants on UberEats, Roxu Fusion only up charges on a select few sushi rolls, not every menu item. The Pearl of the Orient does not up charge at all.   The owner, Joe, was professional with his response to my inquiry, and I do understand why they would increase prices, just from a consumers point of view, it doesn't look good especially when they are the only restaurant doing it and their prices aren't cheap to begin with. I will probably put them on the back burner when it comes to take-out, but I do hear that they have a great happy hour so I would suggest checking them out during that time."}
{"text":"So we didn't even make it to ordering and left the restaurant. First the sever talked to us like we were stupid. I guess I can deal with that if it is a pretentious nice place. But it is not. During her dissertation of the menu, which really only highlighted the most expensive things on the menu, the server casually mentions that they do not have any sashimi or nigiri available tonight due to a late shipment but that they do have sushi.  Wait, sushi but no sashimi? When I questioned the server on this she got snotty and stated that most sushi is cooked in case I didn't know. WTF!?! Sushi in my opinion is always the marriage of properly cooked and seasoned rice with the great quality seafood. Deep fried sushi is meant to hide poor quality rice and fish. What does it say about the spicy tuna roll when the server tells you there hasn't been a fish delivery? Is the chef passing off older less than fresh fish in mayonnaise  soaked rolls or was the server just an idiot?  Either way, we left and I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Okay so me and my mom came for Happy Hour we had EDAMAME,CALAMARI,MUSSELS, THEE LAKEWOOD AND SPICY TUNA ROLLS this food is so amazing. Every I recommend you come try them out and they have Happy Hour from 4-7 Thank you guys so much for the great service."}
{"text":"The staff was the most favorable aspect - they were all very nice and accommodating.  I was expecting more of a traditional sushi experience, but this wasn't it.  Most of the rolls are \"trendy\" with a dozen (cooked) ingredients in each one.  Maybe I just prefer a more simplistic approach but to each their own.  They were out of hot saki so that was a bummer.  The miso soup here is pretty fantastic.  It has edamame dumplings which I didn't even know were a thing but combine some of my favorite foods that that soup was definitely the highlight!  It's a very nice restaurant, nice décor, but probably more suited to people that like the idea of sushi more than actual sushi.  It's definitely worth checking out for the miso soup alone!"}
{"text":"We so badly wanted to like this place. I have no idea if we had a bad server or if service in general is that slow. It took 35 minutes to get edamame...our appetizer. Drinks took about 20 minutes. I should add that there were maybe four to five seated tables in the whole place. I will say this, for a signature cocktail, it was good and strong. Most places tend to be sweet and weak. I liked it. The sushi was probably good, but hard to judge because after an hour I got rolls that I didn't order. Will I be back? Probably not. Other than the drink, it was not impressive. I ignored the reviews and was sad I did. I should have listened to the others."}
{"text":"I ate at VooDoo Tuna a week ago and beyond trying to figure out why they chose a culturally appropriative business name (what does a fish have to do with a religion stemming from African diaspora? The name is basically the equivalent of Catholicism Walleye), I'm still trying to figure out what they \"fused\" with Asian cuisine to come up with their menu. Is it Asian/Douchebag fusion? Asian/Dude Bro fusion? Either way, its not a fusion I'd recommend fusing with.  The bar feels like you're in the home goods section of World Market. It has nice floors, a nice bar, nice pendant lighting, but none of these components actually mesh together. Also the blue/purple lighting from above the bar was super Miami Vice. There's a place and time for that, but its not here, Don Johnson.  Here are the things I ate & drank and a short description of them:  toyko mule= quite refreshing, delicious- actually, the carrot dangled in my face that kept me in my seat for 110 minutes.  bbq eel steamed bun= inedible, literally served in a pool of sauce. Should be called \"miniature eel sloppy joes with extra sauce\"  lobster nachos= I want you to picture one of those heinous jello salads that someone's aunt who had no friends would bring to a party in the 70's. Does it have sour cream and unintelligible fruits in it? Perfect. Now you know what to expect when you order the lobster nachos at VooDoo Tuna. There is a mound of a lobster-like-salad encompassed by a mountain of chips that are unidentified fried something. They just taste like fried- you could offer me a million dollars to tell you what they consisted of and I couldn't tell you.   Were you expecting cheese on these nachos? Surely you jest, these nachos are the kind of nachos drizzled with a sweet brown syrup! You know, Asian fusion dessert nachos! DUH  unagi roll- do you like the idea of the sweet potato casserole from Boston Market encased in rice? Order this roll!  lakewood roll- tastes like something you'd get at a fair. Like fried mayo and a crappy prize that you'll donate to Goodwill in 6 months.  Bright sides/ my reason for more than 1 star= My waitress was really wonderful and definitely felt bad that it took about 45 minutes to get our sushi. (This wait was fine- its made to order and we had apps & drinks.) My drink was seriously great, and my date enjoyed their drink as well."}
{"text":"If you like steam buns that haven't been steamed and resemble hard Wonder Bread, if you like mediocre sushi that actually tastes sugary (sorry, but just...no), if you like sitting at high top tables with cheap chairs that will leave you aching the rest of the night, then Voodoo Tuna is for you! I expected a lot more from people who'd been with Ballantine, where the food is actually good. I join the ranks of the other Yelpers who long for Sakura's return. Til then I guess I'll just have to drive to the east side if I want decent sushi. Sad!"}
{"text":"Good food! I ordered the edamame, veggie hot buns, and the herbivore roll. The edamame was good, it came with a Thai chili sauce that tasted alright, nothing special. That same sauce literally comes on everything. I found that to be strange. Anyways, the hot buns were unique and a good appetizer portion. The \"bun\" is somewhat of a cheesy gordita crunch shell consistency, in a good way. The herbivore roll was really fresh, and I was impressed with the flavor. My bill was about 25 dollars, for the appetizers split with a friend, a beer, and my herbivore roll. Seems like a high price, but the food and service were good so I didn't really mind. I'd like to go back during happy hour next time so it'll be a little more affordable."}
{"text":"Very good sushi restaurant with plenty of unique rolls to choose from. It's definitely a place to try new things!  Classic rolls are also available and are delicious. Their miso soup was good and different than most with two fried dumplings. They should have used a little more salt in the soup to really get the flavor to come out. They also have fancy and unique drinks to try, little pricier than most places. I gave it four stars due to the price doesn't match the level of food."}
{"text":"An affront to the food that they purport to serve. I was open-minded and eager to taste Voodoo Tuna, and ordered sushi and miso soup. Their \"sushi\" is a little bit worse than Giant Eagle sushi, except three times the price. They add a lot of American twists which show they nothing about sushi - combining pecan, cucumber, and salmon for instance.   Their \"miso\" soup was laughably ridiculous - it was ginger water with not a taste of actual MISO paste. Literally - the girl that I brought said it tasted like watered-down tea. Do not order that under any circumstances.  Don't go here if you care about sushi or having a good meal. It's also overpriced. The wait staff was friendly, but \"Voodoo Tuna\" is an affront to Asian cuisine. If a group of white people are going to start a sushi lounge, you should learn a little about the cuisine you're serving before you try to make it \"fusion.\""}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out and I wish I hadn't gone now. This place has the worst service ever I waited 20 mins for the waiter to return back to our table for napkins and to place r entree orders (the place was empty only 15 people on total). Then the sushi was terrible they should keep the sushi making the Asians."}
{"text":"soooo i had read a few reviews that were less than great. honestly, i am so glad that i did not let those allow me to steer clear of this little place.  we went in on a tuesday night, so it was not super busy, but the place was full. we were seated immediately and had really great service.  everything we ordered was on point. delicious too. i LOVED the crab rangoon roll. perfect in every aspect. i love that you can sit at the sushi bar or belly up to the regular bar.  i thought it was a little bright in there, as in like lighting, but hey if that is all to complain about then, so be it, right?  we will definitely visit again. thanks VOODOO tuna for allowing a sushi option in the l-wood!"}
{"text":"I returned tonight, a year later for a friends birthday dinner.  Things have definitely improved, especially with service.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Lakewood! Half off starters and half off 6 piece sushi rolls until 7.. the Lakewood sushi is my favorite! Our server was friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on opening night. We've been waiting for a decent sushi place to open in Lakewood since Sakura closed a few years ago. I had mixed expectations since I've been to other restaurants when they're new and it takes some time to get everything going. I was pleasantly surprised that they seemed to have it together with the service and the decor, and it looked like they put in a lot of effort to be ready for their first day.   Unfortunately, it seems that they prioritized presentation over quality. I wish they'd put as much effort into the food as they did into the service.  We ordered a kale salad, wakame salad, shrimp po boy bun, various sushi and sashimi rolls and the pad thai. Honestly, the wakame salad was probably the best of everything we ordered. My wife says the buns were undercooked, and her kale salad wasn't very flavorful. The sushi and sashimi were average at best, like maybe a notch above Heinen's. That would be fine, except for $9 and up per roll we expect something better than grocery store sushi. The pad thai was decent, but not spectacular.  I get that this is an \"Asian Fusion\" restaurant, so the goal is to try something different, and combine traditional with more modern, but really, you need to have the basics down before you can experiment.  Given enough time they may be able to make this place special, but honestly we're in no hurry to go back right now."}
{"text":"I got Voodoo Tuna last night for my friend and myself. We got the lobster nachos and calamari. I loved the nachos! I always have to buy extra chips because they are so addicting ! The calamari was a bit sweet for me, however I did ask for a lot of extra lemon which they provided, so it did help cut a lot of the sweet. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi with interesting roll options that are a fun departure from the norm.  Had the French toast rolls, that basically tasted just like breakfast!  Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Voodoo Tuna.  It's right down the street from me, the service is excellent and they have amazing happy hour prices.  However, I was not that impressed with my foods.  I ordered a couple of rolls: Ahi Tuna-which was  good, Hamachi-the red pepper felt out of place and  Spicy Tuna Roll- had a dollop of sriracha  that overpowered everything else. It was a  very mediocre experience compared to the happy hours I spent at Ginko (phenomenal btw).  What really disappointed me was their version of the Miso Soup which was very bland-didn't look like it had any miso in it, in fact it tasted like very watered down beef broth.  I judge sushi establishments by their spicy tuna roll and miso soup....I'm afraid to say they failed on these marks."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars for the service, atmosphere, and drinks, which were all very good; however the food fell short. It looked pretty, but was below our expectations, especially for the price.  The miso soup was bland, the Bayou roll was odd- crawfish and sushi just don't mix well, and the Udon bowl was good, but salty.   The classic rolls, ahi tuna and Unagi, were very good. Both seemed like they were made with fresh ingredients and were quite succulent. Maybe they should stick to the staples.   I want this place to do well, please work on your consistency and offering!"}
{"text":"The menu seem short and little, but the sushi was average for its pricing. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"As an experienced server and bartender, I really struggle with leaving negative reviews.  My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night without a reservation.  The hostess was very polite and indicated that they were booked on reservations, but seats were available at the bar (which offers a full menu).  We were happy to go with this option. We were also cognoscente of the fact that it was a Friday, and things were busy.  We took the seat at the bar and.... from that point, we were pretty consistently disappointed with the service (again, taking into consideration the restaurant was busy) The bartenders didn't seem to have much concern for those sitting at the bar. Actual time to receive water or place a drink order, between 10-12 minutes.  We had to request utensils for our food, our beverages were left empty on a rather consistent basis without the offer to refill (both water and cocktails), our dishes were never cleared, and etc..  The food was pretty decent and the rest of the staff seemed pleasant.  The bartenders just didn't seem to be taking care of the bar, or its patrons.  With a food scene that Cleveland embraces, I would suggest that Voodoo Tuna evaluate this area of service failure.  Cleveland has plenty of restaurants.  Some succeed, some fail.  Many failures are a result of experiences similar to this."}
{"text":"Voodoo tuna has some kinks to work out, but the quality of the food and atmosphere is quite good. I really want to return during their happy hour for half off rolls.   By kinks to work out- I'm referring to service. Everyone was very friendly but most of them seemed to be new and still learning. We sat outside and our dishes got delivered to the wrong table who quickly started eating them even though they knew they already had gotten their order so it wouldn't get taken away. So they had to remake ours and eat the cost of the extra rolls. A few minutes later the table next to us ran into the same issue so I think they might need a better system for the food runners.   The rolls we got were very good and the fish was fresh. My dinner date loved the bacon roll and I was very satisfied with my salmon nigiri"}
{"text":"There sushi is sub par. The chefs are not experienced and the restaurant sells food st an inflated price. I will not support a fake Japanese establishment"}
{"text":"We were looking for quality sushi in Lakewood since we lost Saqura. This place has interesting looking drinks, but expensive.  You can't hide overly ripe, what I call \"Zombie Avocado\" in SUSHI! Something I wouldn't even eat at home, but would throw in the trash! I can see the brown avocado mush ooze out of the roll, onto my plate - um...gross. Where is the cream cheese ??? - What remnants were there appeared to have been squirted in the sushi roll instead of being hand cut and rolled in. The Crab Rangoon Roll was completely lacking cream cheese and chive. The flavor was missing and so were the main ingredients. The Tsunami roll was BIG, but we could not discern the crab salad, nor the cucumber, and the avocado again - overripe/dark mush, and the cream cheese was barely visible. I think the chefs/preps don't really know what they are making, or how to make sushi. I would expect this quality of food from a fast food joint, as that is how it's cranked out - like a production line. A REAL sushi chef would NEVER put mushy avocado and milky runny cream cheese in sushi, because they care about their reputation. I'm just saying..."}
{"text":"My husband and I are definitely sushi snobs. We have been wanting to try Voodoo Tuna since moving to the west side last year.   We started our sushi meal off with an order of edamame as we always do. I had a glass of Riesling, husband had a Sapporo. The edamame took forever to come out, but once it came out it was what we expected. What we didn't expect was the delicious sauce on the side. I don't know what it was; other than soy sauce and sesame seeds. But I could have put that stuff on my whole meal. Seriously so good!!   For our sushi meal we shared a Firecracker roll, a spicy scallop, and a spicy tuna. This place ain't joking with their spices. It was even spicy for me, and I love spicy!! However it tasted fresh and was decent. Not the best sushi I've had but certainly not the worst. We both ordered a side of white rice too. Rice was dried out and cold. I took one bite and was done.   Service was attentive yet slow. Our server was friendly! He took care of us, even if it did take a little while. I'm giving 3 stars cause this meal was $70, and I felt like that was outrageous. Not worth that amount. We usually spend less at our favorite sushi place out in fair lawn! Ambiance was good. I would try again."}
{"text":"The sushi was very good. We sat outside on a nice night and had a wonderful experience. We ordered ahi nachos and potstickers to start, and both were good but not stellar. We also had the firecracker roll (4 stars), crab rangoon roll (5 stars - better than the appetizer version other places), Jamaican bacon roll (4+), tsunami roll (5+ version of a spicy tuna roll), and smoked salmon nigiri Voo Doo (3). All was good, but a little expensive ($140 total bill for 4 people including 4 beers and a cocktail). The maki rolls are slow to come out, but we were there a total of 1.5 hrs, so it wasn't super slow. Most reviews on here were in the first week they were open, so keep that in mind when deciding to go."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite local happy hour for food AND drinks. Interesting place. Stopped in on a whim last week and sat right at the bar. Lucky for us it was 5:30pm and their happy hour is until 7pm. Half off rolls and drafts? Sweet. I literally became giddy with excitement that they had steamed buns, not a part of the happy hour though. Oh well. For two people who were stuffed and buzzed when we left, $35 dollars was worth it. Any bar that plays face off on syfy simultaneously with that guy that hunts giant fish with the accent on animal planet is my kind of place."}
{"text":"came in to get a quick bite to eat but unfortunately quick wasn't what I got. waited to 20 mins for them to bring me a roll of sushi and the place was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this restaurant to open up, hoping it would fill a Westside void of good sushi places. Unfortunately, it misses the mark.  Other than a cool atmosphere, that's all that's really good about it. When we went, we didn't want to wait for a table and sat at that bar. The bartender initially was nice but then I observed him flirting with the servers while we just waited to get his attention to order our drinks (mind you, there was only one other couple at the bar). We waited awhile for drinks before another bartender realized that they were sitting at the service counter. The oriGinal bartender didn't really apologize. He just said he was on auto pilot. Ok....  Thank goodness the drinks were good. But.... The food wasn't. We ordered a traditional spicy tuna and one of the house special rolls, the bayside. I could have gone to constantino's market (aka a grocery store) for better sushi. The bayside left a weird after taste. Overall, the sushi wasn't worth the money. Plus when the manager delivered the food to us, he didn't even notice that we didn't have silverware or plates.   I might consider going back for a happy hour because I liked the drinks and maybe try the appetizers or streamed buns but I'm not counting on it. I'm truly bummed this place didn't work out."}
{"text":"I've been back, and realized that this is more of a bar than a restaurant- and that's OK.  I can deal with that.  The price is a bit high, and the quality is equal to what you'd find elsewhere.  The cocktails are good, though.  Try the blistered shishito peppers as an appetizer in place of the usually boring edamame.  It's a fun departure, and you get a ton."}
{"text":"Came in for sushi and sushi only, and was not disappointed! I had heard that the sushi was so-so and wasn't expecting much from the reviews, but I really liked it! We sat at the chefs table and had great service. The sushi was fresh and I really liked the Lakewood roll... Especially love when restaurants play into the local theme. The bill isn't cheap, but isn't that pretty normal for good sushi?"}
{"text":"Worst ramen I have ever had.  Basically used 15 cent ramen packets for the noodles when they charged 13 bucks for the ramen."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend and was pretty excited to try it out but that excitement dwindled as I walked though the doors. It's a nice location and bigger than what I expected but it's lacking atmosphere, the walls are bare and just grey. Our server was very good but the wait time for our drinks and entrees was a little long for how busy it was. The potstickers we got for an appetizer were great. I ordered 2 sushi plates and was disappointed by both of them. The portion sizes were average but for the price I was expecting a bit more flavor wise. My date for the calamari bowl which had a good flavor and base to it but was overpowered by the spiciness. I understand with it being a new restaurant that there are some kinks to work out, but I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Date night was so much fun here! We've gotten take out here before, but will be back again for dinner. Price was reasonable, and our service was excellent. I tried the red sake sangria and it was unlike any sangria I've had, and I loved it. The miso soup was delicious, and you can't go there without trying the edamame. They have a sesame soy sauce to go along, and it is amazing. I also had the lemongrass chicken potstickers, and they were delicious as well, with the sobe noodles, Thai chili sauce and the mayo drizzle. My date had the spicy tuna and said it was very good. We went on a Friday night at 8:30 and got one of the last few tables open, so reservations recommended. When we had take out, the food was also very good, although we didn't read how many pieces of sushi were per dish, and could have ordered more. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, excellent Happy Hour.  Hand crafted drinks are amazing!  Highly recommend the Sake Mussels."}
{"text":"First time was last night! Wow! That is all I have to say about the experience!  Food was AMAZING! Fresh and made perfectly!  The BEST lobster appetizer EVER! Hands down the best! And I hate lobster! Well not here!  Pricing was spot on for the portions! Just incredible! Keep it up!!!! I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"First time here, normally go to panda wok on west 117. The food wasn't bad. The service took a long time. Server took about 30 mins to take order it took about another 35 mins to get food. Probably won't come back. Cool looking place though. Panda wok is better."}
{"text":"I like the Voodoo that they do at this sushi spot! My girlfriend and I visited on Monday Aug. 29th during Happy Hour. We were certainly happy with our selections! We shared the Edamame, which was well seasoned with sea salt and accompanied with a sweet sauce that we both thought went great with it for a sweet and salty flavor. I got the Lobster  and the Lakewood Roll; both were delicious and satisfying especially at half price!! The Lobster Nachos came with a generous amount of the dip and the nacho chips were well dressed in a drizzle of some kind of sweet and savory sauce...very good! The Lakewood Rolls were delicious as well. We also had a generous serving of the plum wine, which was sweet and smooth.  Our server Kyli was fun and attentive and was committed to making sure we had a good time. If the weather allows, grab a seat out front on the patio, great atmosphere and people watching. Happy Hour lasts from 4pm to 7pm, a great way to try out the starters and some of the rolls for half the price!  I would definitely recommend Voodoo Tuna and I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding! The crab Rangoon roll is the best thing I've probably ever eaten. The lobster nachos are out of this world. The Lakewood & Jamaican Bacon were also great! Get the Green Tea Ni!!! Service was slow and they didn't clear as we emptied the app plates."}
{"text":"The steamed buns were simple but delivered above average tastes. We got the chicken and beef buns. Edamame was standard and nicely steamed.   Drinks were very good. I'd recommend the Gong Tao if you like an Old Fashioned or the Gin-Gin if you'd prefer something fruitier. The Sake Mule was very good with homemade ginger beer.   Sushi was average but the specialty rolls offer some different varieties you don't normally find. A lot of the rolls come with a crab salad that would be better as simple crab. The tuna and salmon was very good. Tsunami Roll was delicious and fresh as was the rainbow roll.   Overall, I'd like to go back to try the nachos which I heard were very good. Didn't get to try the sashimi but would next time. It looked good passing by. Nicely remodeled, walls need some decorations but expecting those to follow. I'd recommend giving it a try just don't expect the best sushi of your life and enjoy the drinks!"}
{"text":"I went here last Friday and had a very pleasant experience.  We wanted to sit outside but no tables were available when we arrived.  The staff was very accommodating and moved us from the bar to the patio as soon as a table was free even though we had already started eating at the bar.  The ginger martini was scrumptious - not overly sweet and garnished with a piece of candied ginger on the rim.  The shrimp po boy steam bun was a perfect starter and well balanced.  For sushi, we ordered the dragon roll and spicy scallop roll.  The dragon roll knocked it out the park, I would definitely order it again. The spicy scallop was good but just the tiniest bit too spicy for me and generally I have a pretty high tolerance for spice - still quite tasty!  Overall, it was a lovely evening and am looking forward to coming back to try more from the menu.  THANKS VOODOO! :)"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but Terrible Sushi and service. Rice was soggy and too densly packed. Bacon roll was terrible. After the seemingly strung out waitress never came back to our table for a single refill or even to bring the check, we threw 60 bucks on the table and walked out unnoticed. Worst experience at a restaurant. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! The chicken potstickers are a must- and the rolls are good too. I love the crab Rangoon roll especially. I don't understand the low review, the happy hour deal is awesome as well"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday. We weren't sure how busy they were so we called when we were on our way to see if we could get on the wait list(if there was one). The hostess ended up being very nice and added us to the list. Upon arrival, we were greeted quickly and sat at our table.   Our server was great! He made sure we got waters, we ordered when we were ready and he kept the food at a good pace. This is very important for us because we had ordered different appetizers and rolls of sushi.   I highly recommend the lobster nachos, they were the best lobster nachos I've ever had. And the Lakewood roll was different but tasty as well. We ordered a few different standard sushi rolls which were delicious as well.   The only concern and the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because they were out of an appetizer we wanted to order (veggie spring rolls), they were out of the bottle of wine we wanted and they were out of a beer someone in our group wanted. Kind of strange to be out of so many things on a Saturday night around 7:30pm.   Our service and food was delicious, I would definitely come back for that however I wish their inventory was better stocked."}
{"text":"Um, gonna give some serious props for the amazing infused vodka and our awesome server Tiffany!! She rocked it and the infused vodka was right on point. So good! They need to advertise and capitalize on it! And how about some happy hour fun? They have no happy hour here.   Tiffany was an awesome server! Hustled and was kind and informative. She knew her stuff and was only mucked up by the slow sushi bar.  Sadly the stars are just for that and the amazing steamed bun with eel.   If you wanna wait over an hour for a roll- give it a shot!We never got our sushi roll and after an hour- we had to can it. But I gotta dock major for that and for the fact that they think they can charge $18 for a dragon roll. Please!!! They don't even charge that in Monaco, Monte Carlo or DC! That is wrong on so many levels. Should be like $12 to max $15. But you gotta earn the stripes on it,   Crying in my delicious infused vodka... Can sushi be done right beyond the Asian infused sushi of Ginko? Or going all the way to Parma or Strongsville?"}
{"text":"Yum!! I ordered the edamame to start - price seemed reasonable and even more so after I saw the huge portion. My friend and I shared the bowl and I was pretty full. I got to crab Rangoon roll as my main course and holy moly was it delicious. I was sufficiently satisfied after my meal and will definitely be going back. They are extremely open to substitutions and additions to make the experience your own. Although I don't like being waited on as intently as I was during my meal, our waitress was very helpful and was there to please us. Great new place that everyone should try!"}
{"text":"I had a few people recommend Voodoo Tuna for sushi so I decided to give a shot for a friend's Birthday last night. I was quite impressed with both the atmosphere and our service. Our server was extremely attentive and very accommodating throughout the meal. I had a spicy tuna roll and the Lakewood roll. Both tasted extremely fresh and also had a different spin on them then typical sushi places. My friend said her seaweed salad was one of the best she ever had. They also had a lovely variety of sake!   My two negatives: First was price- at first I didn't think the pricing was bad until I saw the rolls. I thought they could have been bigger. Second, I was hoping for a wider selection of sushi, however they did offer things like steam buns, ramen ect.   Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love sushi alot so we basically try different places. Voodoo has very nice environment outside and inside. Service are good maybe because they not busy. Food are very good ! This potstick is rockkkkkk"}
{"text":"Went for the second time since the place opened. The only thing I have to say it that the place will not last. It's terrible, terrible service, terrible atmosphere, overpriced for the quality... Such a disappointment. I always support local businesses and this one is a huge let down. Don't waste your time or your money!"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out here once after reading some negative reviews.  I don't think we'll be back.  The flavors didn't meld very well and we were very generally unimpressed.  If we are going to eat sushi, there are better places in town to get it from."}
{"text":"Open concept. First time visiting. I am sure they have their good nights, but tonight was not it. Sat at main bar. 1 bartender who seemed overwhelmed with making table drinks and other customers. Took sometime to even say hi to me. And throughout the night it seemed to take forever to even refill my drink which I needed up switching from whisky to water cause of it. And I ate my entire dinner without a follow up visit. Asked about the noodle broth bowls and picked a suggestion. Assuming I would get a broth noodle bowl. But sadly I got a noddle bowl with very little broth. The pot belly gave the noodle an odd taste. Noodles seemed dry even with some broth. It actually felt like I was eating the less than $1 Ramon noodles. And for the price the the amount seems small. Now that could have been the style of bowl used. But it turned out to be just right.   Sadly I was testing this place for a future visit for a date night. I suggest finding another place. For this reviewer will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not usually one to write a review, but my mom and I sat at the bar, it took about a good 5 minutes to even be greeted with menus and a drink list. And another 6-8 minutes to get an order in.   The bartender was nice, but seemed in no rush to get much done. Drinks were good, but wouldn't rush back to drink there again, they were out of ingredients for both drinks that we ordered.   The food was terrible, my chicken was raw, and my sushi had a hair in it.  We didn't even complain really, but they comped the whole meal, which was nice. But not expected. They must have known our experience was bad.   Ended up going to another place down the street and got pizza, since we were still hungry. Very disappointed, since I had heard good things about voodoo.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I was there last night.  We shared the lobster nachos and the steamed buns.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Voodoo! They have a fantastic happy hour at the main bar with friendly bartenders and great drinks!  You can't go in expecting standard, traditional sushi. It is not that. This sushi has bacon and bananas in it. It is a huge twist on traditional sushi and I think if you go in knowing that, it's much easier to appreciate the place for what it is.   Don't get me wrong, some of their more traditional rolls (like spicy tuna) are really delicious. But they excel at things like a crab rangoon roll. They make great cocktails and have a great sake list, too!"}
{"text":"So today was my first time at Voodoo Tuna in Lakewood. We entered thru the back, there was a sign that said to go up front to be seated.. which was fine.. they seated us at a 2 top across from the bar in minutes. Our server was Natalie, she was nice, informative but rushed.. felt like she didnt know how to engage with us or reassure the turn around time for our food. We decided to order watermelon martinis, but were told they didnt have the stuff to make it so we went foward with sex on the beaches. This is my normal dinner drink, it was a bit strong which i wont complain about .. it was more disappointing that they missed 2 of the main strong points.. pineapple and cherries. I did ask for a side of each. So we went ahead and ordered the spring roll appetizers and for our entree we ordered the crab ragoon roll and the lakewood roll. For the spring rolls, they came quick.. they were flavorful and i liked the fried crust , the only problem was that they were borderline soggy.. i couldnt figure out if it was from the vegis from the inside causing it or the oil from it being fried. Ok so heres my biggest issue, we waited 48 minutes from when we received the appetizers to when we finally received 2 rolls of maki. I ended up asking the waiter how much longer, this is where i meant she really didnt know how to address the situation. She told me it wont be to much longer, but avoided eye contact with me the rest of the time until my food came. I dont know, maybe i was just looking for reassurance or a check up of some sort. Maybe you guys should include chips and sauce or something to pass the time, it would definitely help the edge u get from waiting. Ok so for some reason both of our rolls were put on the same plate.. thats a big no for me especially with all the sauces tossed on to each one individually, what if this was a business dinner or for example i dont like foods touching that are of different flavors.. Definitely seperate the orders. As for our sushi, i thought it was great. Flavors were awesome, good size, perfect texture. Again the only thing disappointing is that i waiting so long for something to be ate in 15 minutes, i was ready to go by the time i started. All together, the place still needs some decor and character, but the vibe and the people were modern soho.. u can feel the lakewood presence. I will be trying this place out again though, every new business has to start some where and i believe this place can definitely become a permanent new neighbor."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I feel like it's often over shadowed by its overly trendy neighbor. The sushi is wonderful, their soups are amazing and their pot stickers are my absolute favorite. Carry out or dine in, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went there tonight after not being there since they opened thinking they would have worked out the kinks.  Pros: awesome happy hour (on paper). $1 off signature drinks, $5 house wines and maybe $3 dollar beers (not sure on that one) but also half off Maki rolls and Starters.  Edamame was huge but half were hot and the other half were VERY cold in same bowl. It's just a veg so it won't kill me but I just wondered how they prepared it that it would come out that way. The Sauce that came with them was a sweet sesame brown sauce which was good/different for Edamame so I liked that!  Cons:  Sushi wasn't good. :( The first roll I ordered tasted spoiled so I pushed it to the side after one piece. I ordered a second roll and when it came it looked better than the first so I tried it. I had high hopes that the second would be better but they missed the mark. Jamaican jerk bacon (was just Canadian bacon chunks) had no flavor and was stuck next to a crab stick also with no flavor. This made it extra tough to chew through which you don't expect with sushi. The idea is good but the execution needs work which is probably why there was so many open tables in the place.   Hoping for the best for this place.  I want this place to succeed because we need a good sushi place in town but I'm worried it's not going to cut it. I'd rather go to Ginko in Tremont and pay a little more, than drive 1.5 miles down the road to this place."}
{"text":"Voting three stars for now, because it hasn't been opened for a full week so I still want to give it the benefit of the doubt and return due to my love of sushi and Lakewood.   Atmosphere was nice, I love the Lakewood vibe and this place fits right in.  Drinks were good, strong. One of the perks of waiting is getting just a little tipsy.   My waitress Natalie was nice, can't really blame her for the long wait, but she did everything we asked.  Three problems.  The wait: Now I don't want to be too hard on them because I can imagine how difficult opening week is before everyone gets into the groove of things. But we ordered our appetizer ( which is two veggie egg rolls ) and two maki rolls ( one Lakewood maki and the one Crab Rangoon) at the same time. It took about twenty mins for the appetizer and then another forty mins on top of that for our maki rolls. If the wait will be this long I can only hope they will provide some type of munchies to keep us distracted. Like wontons and dip or something.   The Food: The veggie egg rolls came out soggy in the middle, it was good but the inside was way softer than any egg roll I've ever tasted, as if the oil was not hot enough so the egg roll oil sucked up the oil a little more.  But it was good, 3/5. When the maki rolls finally came out, my maki felt like it was sitting out a little longer than the other one but it was good just wished I could taste the heat from it being deep fried.   The TV: My only personal pet peeve is too have a variety of channels going on multi TVs not only one game going on, especially if we are loosing, winning no problem, I love being apart of the hype. But when the wait for food is over a hour long and shark week is on, never change shark week.   Looking forward to coming back, hoping the wait isn't as long and I can tune into shark week."}
{"text":"The food was actually very good, unfortunately I'll never be back. You see, I absentmindedly left behind on the table a very nice pair of sunglasses, in a place that would only be noticed if one were to bus the table. Of course, by the time I realized my mistake the next day and called the restaurant said glasses were no where to be found. That is not to say all the staff are dishonest, as they were reporting to me they had found a pair of sunglasses which unfortunately turned out not to be mine.  In any case, one bad apple has forever ruined a tasty restaurant for me. I suppose if you're more careful with your belongings than I was, maybe you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I was dying to try this place out ever since they put up signs. I somehow missed the grand opening, and that's just as well as many other reviewers said they had some hiccups.   In response to those reviews, I will say that their service was top notch. We were greeted as soon as we came in the door, were seated right away at the sushi bar, greeted again by one of the sushi artists, and had a reasonable wait time for our food.   As others have noted, this is not traditional sushi and that's fine by me. It's not trying to be. It's fusion baby! We started with the lobster nachos which were fantastic! We followed that up with the Jamaican bacon roll, the Lakewood roll, and a traditional Philly roll. They were all delicious and well-prepared. Some of the other reviewers felt that the food was bland. I do not agree. Sure, it's not a party of flavor in your mouth, but you're eating teeny portions of ingredients wrapped in seaweed and rice. I thought it was great.  My only criticisms would be that they are on the pricey side although I always plan to spend a bit extra when going out for sushi. They also really need to get some artwork up there. The gray walls are a snooze. Go down to the Screw Factory of 78th Street Studios and get some local art up in there!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth trying. The sushi rolls are not good, mediocre at best. We tried dragon roll and spicy tuna maki roll. Both were bland and tuna roll was just way too much chopped fish, a very soft fishy texture... Only. In each bite. The house salad was a basic mix of lettuce tomatoes cucumber and stale wonton sticks, total waste of money. The only thing worth eating were the pot stickers, they had some flavor and came out hot.. And we were hungry. The service gets a 2 out of 5, waitress could not make any recommendations when asked. Don't worry about trying this place out... NOT WORTH IT !!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to wait to try it a couple of times before I wrote the review. First time, I ordered take out. I wasn't impressed but it was good. Was hoping for more due to the location being so easy for me. Second time I sat at the sushi bar and was taken over. I loved the atmosphere. The sushi was delicious and worth the price. The service was very good. I've only ate at one other place that had better sushi so I can't give it a 5/5 but I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was great! Our server (forgot her name, but she has blonde hair and she has a dog named Luna) was very sweet, knowledgable, helpful with our questions and was perfectly attentive (not too little, not too much). I love the bonsai trees, the wall art, and the lighting was also very beautiful. I didn't order a cocktail, but I do like their iced tea a lot! You could tell they get quality tea and brew it themselves, no Lipton garbage. For food, we ordered spicy tuna sliders, crab Rangoon roll, and tsunami roll, and octopus sashimi. Wait for food was reasonable, as they were slightly busy for a Wednesday, it wasn't too long. The food was flavorful, beautifully presented, and fresh. I even enjoyed the salad garnish, and I normally do not like seaweed salad, but this was done right! I wish I could come back more often, and would give this 5 full stars, if it weren't for the super high price point! I thought Shinto in Strongsville was expensive! $10+ for a cocktail, $17 for a fancy roll, $8 for three paper-thin pieces of octopus (might have came out as 1/2 oz portion) is just too damn much for me to spend on a meal that my boyfriend and I were still kind of hungry after. I know you get what you pay for, but this is Lakewood, not L.A. Maybe talk about your sourcing, what sets you apart from the other places, why am I paying so much? If I knew more about it, it may be easier to part with my hard-earned money. Otherwise, this is a place I enjoyed, but definitely can't visit very often.."}
