{"text":"10/10 would recommend.  This place is certainly worth rising for. I ordered the RISE Burro, and the flavors of the burrito were some of the best I've experienced in the Phoenix area. If you are a breakfast burrito connoisseur like myself, you will not be disappointed. One thing that I didn't expect to be so great, were the potatoes served on the side. I would go back for the potatoes alone. The best I've ever had. Thanks for serving great food in a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!!! The Pavo Press is amazingly delicious and the staff is extremely friendly and always making sure their customers are happy. Will continue to keep coming back to this spot and always recommend it to anyone in the area :)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!! One of the guys was a student at the school where I currently teach. They are supportive of teachers and SUPER friendly. On Friday I came in with a large group of teachers that had been outside all day. Our food came out quick and it was AMAZING. I had the AZ chicken. So good. Please give this place a chance because you will love it."}
{"text":"In the short time Rise has been open, this was our third visit. Normally, I'm just looking for a place with a nice selection of tea, which the rise has, but I was blown away by the food and hospitality. Johnny and Emily are quick with a friendly hello and smile. The menu includes something for everyone and the portions are huge. The breakfast burritos were some of the best I've had. The burger ranks up there with the best as well, cooked medium, just how I like it. I was full after just half. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Great rise burrito with mixed sweet potato/regular fries at a great price. Lemonade was good too and they didn't make it too sweet. Nice folks at the counter"}
{"text":"This place is great! I was actually surprised when I walked in and it was very clean, open and we were greeted with a smile (something you don't see much of from the other coffee shops around here) and yes, there are tons of coffee shops downtown, it's part of the downtown culture. What separates Rise from everyone else? The customer service, great hospitality and a staff that actually knows coffee and treats you like they want you there. This is a great addition to the neighborhood. I will be there almost everyday  I can't wait to try the food either, I heard their chef makes the best breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Love this new coffee shop! In the old Jobot (but remodeled), they have made the space a lot better. The mocha was amazeballs and the AZ Cancha salad (think modern Southwestern salad) was equally delicious. Jobot may have the fancy new space, but if I'm being honest, this is wayyyyyy better."}
{"text":"Great coffee, beautiful place! Nice patio!  This is in the old JoBot house!!  I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, very good coffee as our group all tried something different and everyone was very happy. Asked for a breakfast burrito in a bowl with no tortilla and it was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a while. Great job! Our second visit here."}
{"text":"I've tried all the popular coffee places in the downtown Phoenix area and in my opinion this one has the best coffee hands down. The staff alone make me want to go back again because they are so friendly and approachable. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Phoenix did not need another coffee shop next to the shop that made it cool to be downtown on 5th st. Bad coffee wannabe local but more like a copy cat type. Don't go here for the faux vibe just go to jobot like we have been for the past 9 years"}
{"text":"Food and coffee are equally amazing. Customer service that is off the charts. Each visit is better than the next. Lovely people and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cute bungalow with awesome craft coffee and amazing staffs! Seriously the best cup of joe bought this side of Roosevelt. The crepes are delicious and the breakfast burrito with chorizo is the perfect way to start your day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Better food. Best people you will ever meet!"}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite place to grab a burger in downtown Phoenix!!! Not only is the food amazing, the  staff is great and super friendly! I cannot wait to try their breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"This is not just another coffee shop, they have hands-down the best breakfast on Roosevelt and more.  Their burros are excellent, love the tri-color potatoes that go with.  Their huge bowl of steel cut oatmeal is so flavorful--perfect if you're craving a sweet, buttery, brown-sugar taste.  They also have grab-and-go salads and bites, which is helpful if you want something healthy on the run.  They have water infused with fresh herbs and fruit, a small detail that goes a long way.  The owner greeted us with such a warm welcome--we had small children with us, and he said he loved seeing them play games and create a family feel.  The rest of the staff is super friendly and helpful, we enjoyed chatting with Emily.  I haven't tried their lunch, but I look forward to returning within the week  as we live on the street and will definitely be frequenting this place.  We love all of the coffee places/eateries along Roosevelt, but The Rise is a definite asset to the neighborhood--they have their own unique vibe that sets them apart from the other local spots."}
{"text":"First off, I judge a breakfast place based on their breakfast burrito. I have had hundreds of breakfast burritos and bar none this is hands down the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. It is huge portions and extremely filling and the flavors are to die for.  Second, my girlfriend has been their several times times and the staff know her by name and extremely kind and ask how her day is going and asked how her finals went. They are extremely personal and go the extra mile.   Third, the owner was there when I went with my better half and he came out and asked how things were and told us about some of his future plans and asked if we had any suggestions. He wants this to be a spot for good food and a staple in the community. He is big on community outreach and has big plans. I really look forward to what he does.  I have called all my friends and told them to check out this place. I strongly recommend you do as well. 5 stars!!!!"}
