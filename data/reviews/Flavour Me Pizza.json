{"text":"Solid pizza, fast service, seats 5 at the bar. We ordered ahead, it took 20 minutes, and when we arrived the pizza was hot and ready. We decided to stay and eat. The shop is well lit and fairly cosy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty stuff...quick service. They dont really have any seating but its a great place to pick up a slice (or two) and take it a block away to the river or back to your desk at work. Fresh ingredients, interesting combinations  and a yummy crust. Great salads too if you feel like being \"healthier\". I'm partial to the greek salad.  Great option if you want to order in Pizza for a work event or party too!"}
{"text":"A cozy mom n' pop pizza parlour with some of the best pie in town!  Lots of unique flavours, great deals, and always a favourite place to pick-up a quick lunch during the work week.  Seating is very limited and the line starts out the door by noon, so go early!  Delivery/take-out available."}
{"text":"Brutal service. I guess you get what you pay for. If you're looking for food to eat after a night out, maybe this is a good fit. I wouldn't go again otherwise. Other better restaurants in the area."}
