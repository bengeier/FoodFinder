{"text":"This spot is a solid place for the lunch crowd with the usual Italian favourites like pasta, Veal sandwich etc for a decent price.  I had the Veal sandwich and it was great, hot peppers were spicy and authentic.  They also have some lunch specials which look great and fresh pizza too.  Bottom line, it's a good lunch spot and I will come back"}
{"text":"I love this place! Simple Italian hot plate with very resonable prices and fantastic food! I usually get the veal on a bun with a greek side salad. Mmmmmmm the only bad thing is how far i work from there!"}
{"text":"I ordered two lasagna for a girls party Absolutely the worst lasagna I have ever and all 10 guests agreed Tossed it in the trash Will never order again 64 dollars down the drain"}
{"text":"Amazing service by the owner lady and i always order from the hot table, for less than 10 dollars its an amazing meal. Beautiful flavours keeps me coming back for more and they have a bar, double +. I love the pasta and the chili oil she drizzles on is amazing. A must try and takeout option is there as well. Dont forget to add cheese.  ===============================PRIYA======"}
{"text":"Food was great service with a smile a real down to earth Italian place. Great experience"}
{"text":"The veal sandwich is to die for, try the home made hot sauce its hot with a sweetness to it. I could not finish the sandwich and I didn't have anything else, so its a big meal for a low low price.   All the staff are Italians and they speak Italian to everyone when  you enter the restaurant. Ciao!"}
{"text":"For only $8 I got one of the biggest portions I've ever received of penne in a rose sauce. On top of being incredibly cheap, the food is beyond amazing! Everything I've tried is delicious, the pizza being my favourite, and the whole atmosphere is pure Italian! The owner is very sweet and says a friendly hello whenever I'm in there. My only complaint is that there's no website so I never know the store hours and I always seem to call when they're already closed. Also they don't seem to be open very late which sucks when I want to order a late night pizza."}
{"text":"As Authentic as you can get.  The food is great!  Had the veal sandwich.  The veal was filled up with amazing ingredients (mushrooms, banana peppers, veggies, caramelized onions) and as the owner would call it explosive but still managed to fit it all in like magic.  If you love nonna's cooking or your friend's nonna's cooking you will love this place.  Lorie (owner) has an amazing attitude.  She puts a lot of heart and soul into her food and the people she meets."}
{"text":"$10.50 later including HST I had a generously sized piece of freshly cooked chicken, pasta, vegetables and a drink. I can't ask for more. I was full and happy when done."}
{"text":"Excellent food and value. The lady at the front is friendly and funny. I like their veal/chicken Parmesan sandwiches. They're huge and better eaten with a knife and fork. They're open all day (unlike the other Italian place nearby). Stop in, you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Was good while it lasted, not sure about ordering a pickup meal but the hot table food was always very good. I knew it was cheap for a $6.00 veal / chicken sandwich and the $10.00 lunch special where always filling! As far as licking figures while working, I've never seen that. I was happy to see that they used the sink after handling money to wash hand and serve the next person. I gave them a four star because not all staff are the same but the owner did try her best! Now closed permanently, paper in the window maybe the new owners can turn it into a gold mine. One complaint would be pizza wasn't big slices like next door."}
