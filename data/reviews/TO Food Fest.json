{"text":"The neat thing about this is that it's a food event that isn't in downtown Toronto! However, it is far from a spectacular affair. There weren't as many vendors present as I thought that there would have been at a \"food fest\", but all things considered, there was still a good variety of cuisines to choose from. The food vendors were split between two locations: indoors and out, with no clear indication that there was an inside section to the event. It was only when we asked someone where they got their drink that we discovered this fact.  The event wasn't jammed packed in the same manner that some of the bigger festivals in Toronto are, with most lines being five minutes or less. This is a welcome change.  One thing that left a sour note in my mouth was that this event was advertised as free admission with an optional $2 donation. When we arrived, we found that we had to walk through a \"gate\" with two tables set up in such a way that only two people could walk through abreast. To me, this implies that the $2 donation weighs less towards optional and more towards mandatory on the optional-mandatory scale (and in case you're wondering, yes, we did leave them a donation)."}
{"text":"There are less booths this year. Among all the booths, the bao from Bao is Life tastes pretty good. I ordered a bao with chicken. The bread tastes sweet, just enough to blend with the slightly spicy chicken. The watermelon drink however is too pricey for its quality. Quite amount of water is added to the juice and it doesn't taste as refreshing as it should be."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)  Many of the venues had foods that people can easily get at restaurants, but there were a few smaller companies that were present presenting many foods that weren't as common. The novelty of some foods made it an above-par venture!  Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)  It was actually my first time attending the TO Food Fest, and this was my first thought: \"Toronto Food Fest? Seems more like a small intersection event...\" The more people there is in one venue, the more festive the venue is. I was originally going to rate the general feel of this event a 3, but on second thought I gave it a 2.5. Sure, it was awesome that the weather just so happened to be fine, the grounds were clean, and there were virtually no lines to purchase food by the time we went on Sunday afternoon. The standard Chinese lamb/chicken/beef/pork kebabs, fries, food trucks, spiral potatoes were all present, but the venue itself lacked new foods. Not having a huge crowd was also quite disappointing, but this might be just me, 'cause I love cramped places-- it MAKES a summer festival! Besides, the general feel and layout of the venue seemed like a glorified high-school event, tbh. The underwhelming-ness mixed with my zeal for summer festivals strikes this at par score.  Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)  Well, it IS a half-indoors-half-outdoors festival, so obviously don't expect any OMG service available, but most of the companies' employees were very happy and enthusiastic to introduce their dishes, which was refreshing to see.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)  Pricier than a normal casual dinner out, but nothing over-the-top for a summer festival. Besides, (not sure if it was an end-of-event sale or something, but) there was a very nice deal of a pulled pork vietnamese taco for $4. That would be enough to feed a small eater very well! Bring at $20-$35 if you actually want to try a nice variety of foods and feel full at the end of your venture though.  Other 5/5 (10% of final grade)  Brownie points round. I love summer festivals in general. Enough said!  Final Grade = 66.5/100 = 3 Stars!  Summary: There are better summer festivals, but summer festivals are all nice, so drop in if you are within a 15 minutes drive. Otherwise, visit something else ;)"}
{"text":"This was one of the first food festivals I visited this year and it stood out as better than ok. 6.5/10 marks.  1. Beware of the lines and many people butting, many new lines being formed, and wait time can take a while. But the people are friendly, just a lack of organization can make things frustrating. 2. Smoke from skewered meats EVERYWHERE. 3. There were 3-4 food trucks so not as many as I imagined.  Tried Cluck Clucks (my chicken waffle go-to place) and Formocha (great wheel cake!), and Busters Sea Cove (never going back because of their highly disappointing tacos)."}
{"text":"This was my first Toronto Food Fest, and I liked my experience a lot. It's a lot less crowded than your typical night market (maybe because it's just starting out, so that might change, but since I don't like crowds, I like this factor and feel the need to mention it), especially if you go during the day time. I also like that it's not limited to simply Asian food but offers vendors and cuisine from all cultures which I found is much more diverse than Night It Up. I had the opportunity to try several different things which made the night a very flavourable and experiental one, food wise. Ended up bumping into a couple of friends and they said they enjoyed themselves as well. Come next year and come hungry!"}
{"text":"Are you tired of swimming through sticky people to get to some skewers? Do hour long waits for overpriced, mediocre foods make you sad? Well, come on down to TO Food Fest! Actually, you can't. It's over. But maybe next year!   On a gorgeous Sunday morning, friends and I headed down to experience some exotic treats. Getting there early enough meant we got to park in the lot in front of the community centre. So refreshing to have room to move around and to actually try all the things we wanted to try. I'll try to keep my descriptions short and sweet:  DaanGo (aka. Masterchef Baker Siu): Asian inspired macarons (delicious), tarts, and the most Instagramable dessert ever: agar fruit marbles in syrup. $15 for 6 macarons and $6 for a cup of the cool fruit bubbles.   Fish'D (by EDO): Salmon sushi burrito is exactly what you'd expect. Pretty delicious but also tastes exactly as you'd think a big sushi roll would taste like. $12 for a full one and $7 for half.   Yakikuza: They did one thing and one thing only: bacon and shrimp okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake). And they did it so well. Deliciously fried batter with sauces and two strips of bacon + small shrimps. Oko-NOM-iyaki indeed. ($8)  Teppan Ice Cream: Cute guys with nice arms rolling ice cream? Uhhh yes, please. I thought these rolled ice cream things would be kinda gimmicky but that was actually delicious. I got the lychee (real lychee pieces chopped up into the cream), with condensed milk and peanuts. $7 for some creamy, creamy goodness.   There were a ton of other fantastic stalls/food trucks that I didn't get to try like Chocollata Gourmet (beautiful Brazilian truffles), the pork belly bao, and the liquid nitrogen frozen popcorn. Great variety, fantastic quality, and I was pretty stuffed after 2.5 hours there.   As a note, yes there is a donation amount of $2 requested. Yes, it's voluntary. Yes, there are some lovely ladies that sit at the entrance and ask you, in a very polite way, to donate. If the setup makes you uncomfortable because you feel like you're being \"forced\" to donate, that's your stingy attitude making you feel that way, not the people there (*cough* other review..).  (68/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I came on Su J's recommendation. I didn't even know of this festival until last night. I was planning on going to Taste of Lawrence, which is right around the corner from my church, but this one seemed promising as well, so I decided to take a risk and come here instead. It definitely paid off. Compared to other food festivals (Taste of Lawrence, Taste of Asia, Night it Up, T&T Nightmarket), this one has fewer repetitions of food and is relatively cheaper, with many dishes in the $5 range. There were a few even cheaper than that too! I also greatly appreciated its indoor and outdoor aspects (indoor had air con and seating).  Highlights included $5 loaded nachos (Los Vietnamita), Frozen Stone  - liquid nitrogen popcorn (more fun than anything), ube ice cream sandwich (Kanto by Tita Flips), and pork and pork intestine skewers (Marcelinas Filipino Cuisine). None of the above costed more than $5 each.  The best thing, however, was Laura Slack Chocolate Artist's popsicles. We got blood orange and coconut, and strawberry, balsamic, and coconut. Each popsicle was $3. They were so good that we went for seconds...and thirds. Yeah. That.  I'm definitely coming next year!"}
{"text":"TO Food Fest happened again this summer and finally, my summer travel plans didn't conflict with this wonderful gem; and despite our horrific summer this year, boy, I was glad I was in Toronto that day!    TO Food Fest is still relatively new and so there aren't a lot of vendors and I personally feel that the Taste of Danforth stole their thunder just a little bit that weekend.  However, it is cute, small, and while there is a constant flow of visitors, you don't feel like you're going to be squished by other sweaty humans and subsequently die.    Most importantly, this event is for a wonderful cause and your $2 admission fee/non-perishable item goes towards Second Harvest.    Here are some of my most favourite and notable places:   1) Gushi Japanaese Street Food - Fried chicken on a skewer with DELICIOUS sauce.  You have a choice between spicy mayo, sweet chili, or tetsuya sauce (a citrus-y, vinaigrett-y sauce).  FANTASTIC.  I loved loved LOVED their chicken.  Despite the chicken being dipped into that vinegar-y sauce, it didn't become soggy.  I can definitely see why there was a huge long line for this!  2) Mamak Satay - We had pork, beef, and chicken skewers.  The peanut sauce was good but I think the meat actually even tasted quite good without the sauce too!    3) Grilled Squid - Unfortunately, I have no idea and have completely forgotten the name of this great squid place.  If you like grilled squid, this was definitely a place that perfected it.  As a \"not-so-big\" squid fan (my friend wanted it), I did thoroughly enjoy it and that's saying a lot.  The seasoning they use is pleasantly spicy.    4) Marathon HK Milk Tea - Now they sell their milk tea in jugs!  It wasn't too busy when I went in and there was a deal going on where you got 2 iced-milk teas for $5.  I love their milk tea for the creaminess and the fact that despite how strong milk tea is, the cream masks the tannins.  But you don't get that gross after-taste you get from drinking coffee with too much cream.  Overall - excellent!  This gem is located in Scarborough on Finch & Midland.   And last but certainly not least...  5) Babi&Co ***MY FAVOURITE*** - I don't even know where to start with this one except for the fact that there are 3 simple words to describe this place...BRILLIANT, DELICIOUS, ADDICTING!  I really wish they didn't just show up in food fairs as it would be so lovely for them to actually have a food truck or a restaurant.  As a matter of fact, I'd venture to them as often as I could if they did!  Their pork satays were so delicious and tender and the pickled cucumbers on the side really complimented the satays well.  I also had the opportunity to try the \"Babi on a Bun\".  OH MY GOSH - for a good 10 seconds of enjoying this bun, I thought I was in heaven.  This is a MUST TRY for any of you who ever encounter Babi&Co.  This was definitely my most favourite vendor in all of TO Food Fest.  The family who ran this place were friendly as can be and their food was delicious.  If they were the only place that existed at TO Food Fest, I'd still go!"}
{"text":"Omnomnomnomnomnomnom. I specifically skipped breakfast just so I can try out as many different kinds of food cuisines as possible.  TO Food Fest happened this past weekend. While the location isn't the best, attendance was phenomenal. The best part was that it wasn't just Asians that were here, but a whole mix of different ethnic groups all converging into a church building and a parking lot. Multiculturalism at its best!  Some of the foods I've tried included mochi from Mochi King, calamari from Baha Tacos, milk tea from Marathon Cafe, cheesesteak from Lamesa Filipino Kitchen, Hawaiian skewers, and finally a mango slush to call it a day. While it is amateur hour for many vendors, you can sense the creativity and effort they put into making their food, and with that I was quite happy with most of the food I received.  I was lucky to arrive right at the opening bell at 1pm. By the time I left around 3:30pm, many of the vendors were already sold out of their foods! Perhaps they underestimated the demand of this event, but it was certainly a well attended one, especially given the scorching heat for the outdoor vendors. Man, I wonder how they survive cooking with all that heat and (in some cases) charcoal blowing right at their faces.  Hopefully Night It Up lives up to this, cause this event took food cuisines to the next level."}
{"text":"Had a really fun time at this festival! Tried a bunch of different things, grilled squid skewers, some Filipino skewers, Cambodian skewers, lots of different delicious skewers! Visited at around 2-4pm and lines were very manageable, the most we had to wait was 3-4 minutes to get our food, the venue wasn't crowded or overwhelming and everyone seemed to be having fun, taking pictures of the delicious food. We also tried Japanese raindrop cake which was really interesting and refreshing as well as liquid nitrogen frozen popcorn. This event is really fun for trying new food and discovering different restaurants/food trucks in the city. Most snack food items were reasonably priced around $4-$8 but more substantial food items were $10+. The biggest draw for me was how it wasn't overly crowded like night it up. I'll definitely be back next year!"}
