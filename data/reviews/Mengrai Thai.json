{"text":"This is hands down the best thai food in town, everyone raves about the chicken lychee curry and its worth all the hype, i also tried the chicken basil recommended by the owner who is super sweet and accommodating.  However the service here is slow and its always a long wait for food and thats the only reason they're not getting a five star. Please speed up the service! even tho ill keep coming back for the food regardless."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Sasi's Pad Thai with sun dried shrimp is delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai food and went to Mengrai Thai based on other reviews, and I was not disappointed!  Based on the recommendations of our server, we tried the fried spinach, lychee curry, steak, and house lobster/shrimp soup.  I'm not a big veggie eater but the fried spinach was one of the best vegetarian dishes I've tried - I could eat vegetable all day. The other dishes were equally delicious.  The service is also excellent. We met the owner Allen. He is very down to earth! The restaurant is frequented by A-list celebs including Jessica Alba, Samuel Jackson, and etc. And I can see why!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Great food, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, everything just clicked well. And not far from where I live, yay! This one is my favourite when compared to some other thai restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. The ingredients are fresh, the food is tasty and the service is great. And as some others have mentioned, the restaurant is OPEN! Their .com website was hacked so ignore the message there...their new website is http://www.mengraithai.ca"}
{"text":"Sasi's Pad Thai is second to none. The shrimps are plump and juicy. The flavour is nothing like other pad thai joints. Sasi makes her own shrimp paste from scratch. Morning Glory appetizer is a must. Allan, the owner, likes to get to know the customers so he usually chatting them up."}
{"text":"The dishes here taste very unique and are presented very nicely to please the eyes. Each and every dish I ordered from their menu had is own distinct flavour and creativity. Who would've ever though of mixing chicken curry with leeches'? Or lamb curry and peaches? It might sound like a weird combination, strangely enough, it tasted quite good where flavours of sweet, salty and spicy played well together to tingle your taste buds.  Though I've been able to try Mengrai's unique dishes, I still don't think it's possible for me to say their restaurant is the best place to eat Thai food. I personally think it'd just be a good place to try out as the prices are pretty expensive for what you get. I was most impressed with the service as it was impeccable and super friendly. For every dish that came out, our waitress would come to our table every so often to ensure that we were happy with our order. I think the servers her are just genuinely kind."}
{"text":"Oh wow, so good.  My friend took me here for a birthday dinner.  It was yummy.  I had the prix fixe.  After a hiccup regarding my choice of first course, I ordered vegetarian, they brought me the other option.  It was easily remedied, though I think they just took the shrimp off and replaced it with the cold roll.  The pumpkin soup with breaded spinach was yummy  and just the right portion.  I ordered the #54 for my main and it was delightful.  The mango snowball was sooo good.  We were glad they served it with small spoons as it forced us to savour it.  I wish the restaurant was closer to where I live/hang out."}
{"text":"I Have to say that this is the real deal if you are looking for Thai food In Toronto! I am the chef owner of The Corktown Kitchen and have eaten here numerous times and have never been dissapointed. If you want Authentic Thai. Eat at The Mengrai. Good Take out food is hard to come by. Have to give Five stars on this place. Chef Matt"}
{"text":"Sublime interior plus original & tasty take on traditional foods...you've gotta leave room for the sticky rice with mango dessert.  So good!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This is an incredible restaurant, and for many reasons:  food, service, and atmosphere.  Food first of all:  my wife and I had the prixe fixe menu, which, for $37 was very generous and not at all outrageous price wise.  Every course, every bite was intense, harmonious flavors on the palate and excellent execution all around.  I won't describe each dish in detail, but my main course was the beef ribs, and they were fall off the bone gorgeous, intense, and as flavorful as I have ever tasted.  Service was all smiles and attention throughout the evening, and the location is very intimate and romantic, with an historic feel you'd find in Europe or Tribeca.  Bottom line, this place is as good or better than anything I have tried in the likes of NYC, San Fran, Chicago, and Toronto.  Go there and eat, you will love everything about it....!"}
{"text":"Overall - Okay Thai Food for Delivery but would not order again.  Red Curry Chicken with Lychee and Pineapple - The first thing that I noticed was that they do not include rice with their Curries... nor did the person over the phone who I ordered from mention that this was the case.  Not a big deal as I had some white rice... the food itself was bland, the pineapple and lychee added nice contrast to the spice, but the curry itself was lacking flavour and almost felt watered-down.  I would not order this again despite it being strongly promoted  Chicken Pad Thai - Again, not a very exciting dish, the lime that accompanied it was not fresh and the flavor of the dish itself was again, somewhat bland.  If I haven't tried at least a dozen other Pad Thai dishes across the city I would rate this as good, but given the options that are available.  I would not order this again either.  Finally, on the delivery, the delivery time was reasonable, but one warning, the prices on the website do not match the prices on their 'new menu'.  When I asked the driver about it, he proceeded to give me a lecture on rising food prices... anyways....my fault for not asking for the total when I ordered, but something I won't forget to do when I order next time.  The delivery charge of $3 is reasonable but considering there are other Thai delivery restaurants that have better food at a lower price and free delivery.  I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We went in a group of 8 on a saturday night and seems like everyone else had a similar idea!  Cosy little place with an extensive menu.   The appetizer platter was generic but the stir fry was pretty good. We ordered the special red curry with lyche and couldn't really find anything that special in it.  I liked the multi leve seating and private nooks for large groups that allow for good conversations without blaring music. Sometimes thats all it takes for a fun birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner on 26 Nov 2016.  It was not closed and apparently their website has been hacked.    We have been regular customers of Mengrai for many years and they have never failed to please. The stripe bass in coconut sauce is amazing.  There are also lots of great veggie-friendly options, and the service is great.   Oh yeah they have this secret curry dish called the sassy #54 uhmm... probably the best Thai meal in Toronto... not kidding."}
{"text":"Whoooo-eeee! Finally found an excellent Thai place that is not tiny and crowded! I came here for a dinner on Saturday. The place has a rustic and warm atmosphere (brick walls, dim lights).  I tried Sasi's Pad Thai Noodles (~$14) which was probably the most authentic Pad Thai I ever tried! It was seafood-flavoured and very fragrant (definitely not your food court ketchupy Pad Thai) and they were generous with chicken and shrimp. However, if you prefer sweeter Pad Thai, Mengrai offers Street Style Pad Thai and House Pad Thai as well. They were also very accommodating with allergies unlike Linda's Modern Thai whose server said \"It's a Thai place.. what do you expect?\" when I asked them about peanuts.    I also tried their Thai Iced Tea ($3) which was creamy and sweet. I can't say too much about it because it was only my second time trying the drink.   At the end of the dinner, I met the owner, Allan, and he gave us a complimentary dessert - coconut cream cheese and brownie. Brownie points for this exceptional service!   I love this place! I am not a Thai food expert but I really enjoyed my experience here at Mengrai. If you can't fly out to Thailand to try local food, Mengrai is the place you should visit. It is definitely one of the more authentic Thai restaurants in Toronto. Highly recommend this place and I can't wait to come back for more pleasant dining experiences :)"}
{"text":"By far the best penang beef ever!  I'm craving it just thinking about it right now.  Friends have ordered other dishes and loved them too.  I've only been here for lunches when it's not been too busy, the service was polite and efficient.  The atmosphere is cosy, I love the booths with cushions."}
{"text":"My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here two nights ago. We shared two delicious dishes, Original Pad Thai and Regal Red Curry. The waiter who is the owner's son was very friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and helpful. The owners, a husband and wife team, own the restaurant.  Allan runs the front of the house and is incredibly welcoming. He spoke to us for a while and shared photos of his village in Malaysia. His wife Sasi is the accomplished chef. Sasi made my daughter's day by teaching her how to prepare mango sticky rice. The restaurant is clearly frequented by regulars. The women at the table next to us were raving about their favorite dishes. All in all, dining at Mengrai Thai turned out to be a memorable, yet unexpected treat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place. The food here never disappoints, the service is great, and the atmosphere is perfect for any occasion. We typically order glass Noodles and Sasi's pad Thai. Recently I tried the red lychee curry with chicken and it was absolutely delicious!! Their mango sticky rice for desert is nice and light too! Can't say enough about this place, definitely our go to for authentic Thai food"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fantastic service. Stunning decor & atmosphere. We met the chef & you can tell she really cares about her food & her clientele. Each dish is made with looove. The staff are all very knowledgeable & passionate about what they do. Sit-down Thai done right. You definitely get what you pay for. Perfect, cozy place for an intimate gathering or romantic night out. Would go back again in a heartbeat. Best eat-in Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have tried many Thai restaurants in our city.  This one is the same as the rest of them.  How do I judge?  By the most basic and most popular dish, the Pad Thai.  There's no extra sparkle to a Pad Thai, a curry or a fried rice.  All the same recipe just different ways of plating.  I also ordered the curry and it pretty much burnt the tastebuds off my tongue, but I'm not complaining it was supposed to be hot and it was a good quantity.  Kind of wished they put in some vegetables in the curry and not just curry and chicken.      The decor is quite lovely.  However, if you have problems with stairs then this restaurant may not be the place for you.  The servers were quick and ready to serve with a smile on their face.  In conclusion, it's a perfect place to bring a date.  But FWIW, the meal was WAY overpriced as I could have gotten the same quality Thai at any other restaurant for half the price.  I challenge anyone who thinks this place is the BEST Thai in the city.  What makes this place more special then the rest?"}
{"text":"This place has the best thai food i've ever had. The restaurant is family owned, and the chef has amazing recipes! I take everyone here!!!! Great place to go with a couple people and share different dishes!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food with an inventive twist that does not take away from the authenticity of the core Thai Flavours.  For example, their Red Chicken Curry has lychees in it.  The addition of lychees is a nice and fruity taste, but has a great red curry base that grounds the whole dish. However, my absolute favourite is the Filet Stripe Bass in Tamarind Coconut Sauce.  The sauce is so absolutely good that I could drink it by the gallon.    Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Thai restaurant to try on Saturday night and first tried Sukho Thai, which had very good reviews. It was really busy so we ended up at Mengrai. This turned out to be great fortune for us. The ambiance at Mengrai is really nice, definitely a Thai feel, but without being overbearing.   Despite the fact that I like pad thai I usually avoid it because it's not considered to be \"authentic\" enough in most circles, even though you can get it all over Thailand (and have been able to for decades). However, at Mengrai I went for the \"traditional pad thai\", which is different than the regular pad thai, thus solving my dilemma. It was very good, not too sweet and sticky, and was a large portion. My girlfriend got green curry that was extremely good and perfectly spicy. The only thing that was kind of underwhelming was the appetizer platter for two. It's just a bunch of dumplings that are all basically the same.   Mengrai is sort of in a weird spot and you wouldn't stumble upon it unless you were looking for it, but make the effort."}
{"text":"Mengrai Thai is the best Thai food I have had in Toronto.  I was there with a group of 6.  We had the red curry which is served in a pineapple, pad thai, the stripe bass, beef tenderloin, mango salad and some rice dishes.  The red curry and the stripe bass were amazing. I wanted to lick the dishes when I was finished.  All the portions were generous enough so that all 6 of us could have a decent amount - except the pad thai so I wouldn't recommend that for sharing.    Our server was attentive and patient with our indecisive table.  She made plenty of recommendations and did not let us down.   Unlike many other Thai restaurants, Mengrai does not leave you feeling sick and greasy when you're done your meal! If you pay cash, you get a small discount on your meal."}
{"text":"We all need a favourite Thai restaurant  Mengrai Gournet Thai is my go-to Thai delivery. I declare without shame I order the same thing over and over, once or twice a month... Fried springs rolls, chicken skewers with peanut sauce, mango salad and classic Pad Thai with extra shrimp and chicken. While this is my basic all year long, Winter times always call for a tasty spicy lemon grass soup to give it all extra warmth. I highly recommend to anyone located around Moss Park."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience from reservation to dessert. Delectable high value pri fixe menu for $39.95, including 4 mini appetizers. Notable morning glory., second course a pumpkin soup, main entree mostly we ordered vegetarian curries (I was the chicken lady :) of perfectly balanced heat. Bldg was a 100 yo brewery with wood floors and brick and mortar walls. Tastefully decorated with the occasional elephant statue. Staff nonparalleled. Fun nonalcoholic drink: lychee juice and cranberry. Sisi is the mother of all sauces I had her # 54 red chicken curry and immediately dubbed studio 54 :)."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, average take out.  Living in the corktown area, this place quickly became one of our go-tos for Thai food. The food is quite good, but if you dine-in it is just that little bit better so do yourself a favour and dine in - the service is very attentive and the sauces and foods seem just a bit fuller.   Having sampled several things on the menu, I'd recommend the spring rolls, green curry and basil eggplant. I have found the pad thai to be disappointingly average."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from an aunt. I have to say that so far this is the best Thai food i have eaten in Toronto.  Everything was flavourful and yummy. Special mention to Red Chicken curry with lychee and pineapple and spicy basil eggplant which were the best ! Also tried the pumpkin cheesecake with coconut crumb base - interesting - only for those who care to experiment."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!  Food was delicious. Tasted very authentic.  Service was very good. The owner came by our table and spent some time with us talking about the restaurant. We felt very welcomed. We were even offered a drink on the house. Bonus!!!  We got to experience a blessing ceremony that happens once a year, what an incredible experience!  We will defiantly be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night for dinner with a group of old friends who (some) have very difficult palates to satisfy.  When in doubt, go for tasty delicious Thai.  As there were going to be 6 of us, we wanted a place that takes reservations, Mengrai seemed to be the only Thai restaurant to to fit that criteria.  We ordered cold and fried spring rolls as appetizers.  Loved the cold rolls, wasn't too fussed about the fried ones as they didn't seem to really have much filling.  Pretty much everyone ordered different mains, the typical pad thai, curries etc.  I wanted something different, so ordered the bass with tamarind coconut sauce.  It was  truly delicious!  Perfectly cooked fish, beautiful sauce and vegetables which went well with simple steamed rice.  Huge portion too.  I liked that the rice came in little silver bowls with lids to keep it warm.  I am not at all a fan of pad thai.  It always seems to have that nasty ketchup sauce (seriously, I think places actually use ketchup??).  One of my friends ordered it and I must say it was probably the best pad thai I've tried outside of Thailand.  She always orders it, I always taste it and always dislike it, but not this one.   Super lovely waitstaff!  Very extensive wine list, but I opted for a Tiger beer.  Some of the prices are a bit on the high side I think for Thai food (some mains were $20+), especially when you need to add rice to the dish.  The bass was about $18, curries about $15 plus rice.  But super delish, so I don't mind paying the price for yummy food.   I would return. It's also in a very weird location that's a bit of a mission, but there is street parking and it's a short walk from the Queen streetcar."}
{"text":"Loved it! There's nothing to complaint about this restaurant (and I'm a restaurant complainer). I worked in a very authentic Thai restaurant before and I thought no one can beat that, but Mengrai is so far my favorite thai restaurant in toronto. The foods are not overdone, and they don't 'westernize' it. The waiter was very friendly, actually everyone was. My fave was the Pad Thai, it wasn't as saucy and sweet/sour as all the other 99% of places make it.  I'm usually not a big fan of coconut soup but this one was awesome! There's still lots of coconut flavor in it, but I was ok with it (i usually don't like coconut anything).  Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing one dish in this joint.  Chicken Pad Thai Authentic style.  I haven't tried anything else in this place yet but I will be back.  So the chicken pad thai was alright.  Tasty, not oily.  Good subtle flavours.  I got take out and the lime they gave me was bone dry which sucked because a little lime goes a long way.  I've never dined-in but if you're looking for a cool, cozy spot for Thai that's a smidge out of the downtown core then this would be a good choice.  It's one of those places that will impress folks from the burbs because you know about it."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Thai places I've been!  We ordered the Regal Red Curry, the Original Pad Thai, Special Pineapple Fried Rice, and Garlic Shrimp. I recommend trying all of these items, especially the Pineapple Fried rice.   The atmosphere was great; it was quiet enough so that you didn't have to talk over other tables and the decorations were appropriate to the restaurant.   The servers were quick to help us out and always came by to refill the waters as soon as our cups were empty.   This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Definitively going back, very yummy. I've always been curious about this place as I walked by several times. We walked in, the place was empty but several people walked in for take out orders.   The waitress was very kind, attentive and helped us select items off their extensive menu.  The bananes fried dessert with ice-cream was seriously amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Mengrai for years. They are exceptionally good with people who have allergies. We are vegan/gluten free and all of the staff are very understanding when it comes to asking about substitutions and how meals can be prepared to suit our needs. Everyone is always so friendly and polite. The food is always tasty. If they ever decided to sell their spring roll dipping sauce I would be the first in line to buy a few jars. Honestly, it's amazing.   If you're going I'd suggest starting off with the taro spring rolls or the fresh rolls if you're looking for something light. Seriously though, the taro rolls are worth it. Their coconut soups are ammmmaazing. I've asked for glass noodles in the soup and though it sounds weird, it tastes fantastic. Try the Spicy Thai flat noodles, it's not on the regular menu, only on the take out. The noodle is similar to Ho Fun, but the taste is very different, in a good way! The little crispy onions on top makes the dish just perfect. I also would buy a bag of those just to snack on. The dishes are always fresh, steaming, and traditionally made.   The glass noodles are also amazing, so do take the time to try that as well. Any of the curries will also do the trick. You really can't go wrong. This place does get busy because there are often cooking classes, so do make a reservation if you go.  We brought our friend from New York and he was rather impressed. It's a great place to meet friends as there is space on a lower level for bigger groups. The food is great, the service is attentive, and the prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"the food is ok  if presidents choice memories of thailand sauce is your  taste"}
{"text":"Absolutely loooved this place! 5 stars for the food, but also for the ambience and fantastic service. The red curry chicken with lychee was amazing. I am a thai food lover and haven't ever tried red curry prepared in that way. Delicious! We also ordered a basil stir fry chicken which was also amazing. And for drinks, I'd recommend the lychee martini. We were served by the owner, who is a wonderful, friendly man and makes you feel like a guest in his home. At the end of our meal, he introduced us to the chef Sasi (who is his wife) and we had the opportunity to compliment her on the lovely meal."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Recommend the #54 red curry with lychee and the original pad thai. Definitely get the Tom Yum soup to start (one of the best I've had in Toronto). The restaurant has lots of choices, esp in seafood, so I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place and always wanna go there.  But has it's become more popular, the quality has gone down hill.  Even the thai tea doesn't taste the same.  I might go back, if I'm really craving thai food."}
{"text":"I walked by Sukhothai (I visit it weekly) but it was rammed. I realized I've never tried Mengrai during my 3 years in downtown east so walked in.  The place was reasonably busy at 9 on a rainy Wednesday. It was cozy inside and there's nice ivy brick walls on the outside.  The menu was a bit long but I stuck to what appeared to be the \"famous\" dishes - pumpkin lemongrass soup ($7) and the signature red curry chicken with lychee ($18.50).  Besides the little eyelash in the soup (these things happen, and I don't hold it against them - I wasn't grossed out), the soup was decent. It was creamy (coconut milk) and thick. The flavour was unique with the lemongrass mixed with pumpkin. The curry, served beautifully in a carved pineapple, was also unique with full lychees added in. The sweetness balanced out the heat.   The downside was that while 'd say both dishes incorporated some different, unique flavours (that might be the \"draw\" to go here), I did not find the actual quality of the flavours and ingredients to be superior to Sukhothai (I'd give 4 stars to Sukho) or Khao San (4.5 stars).  At this price point and in this style, Mengrai's a nice place to take a date or grab a cozy dinner with friends, but this isn't the best Thai in the city - it's pretty good though."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I have experienced in Toronto and quite possibly the best I have had...period.    Both the food and service are amazing.  The restaurant is deceiving from the outside, based on the restaurant location. However, the interior decor is warm, inviting and quaint.  Suitable for a casual/friendly get together; yet would be a wonderful spot for a romantic dinner as well.  Whether dining in or taking out, Mengrai will surely not disappoint. Great value for the money too.  I suggest the mango salad, cold spring rolls and the green thai curry with chicken and basil!   Of course, their signature pineapple dish is worth the experience as well.   Great place for gluten free and dairy free diet requirements!"}
{"text":"My brother and I were looking for a quick bite, and he recommended Mengrai for takeout.  Once I saw the beautiful decor and we were greeted in such a friendly manner, I insisted we stay.  I am so glad we did.  The restaurant is spacious, nicely decorated and tables are well distributed.  The food was delicious - not salty or over-seasoned.  The service was impeccable.  As a former concierge, I was astounded at the quality of service; our server showed all the hallmarks of having worked at a fine dining establishment.  She was polite, funny and attentive, but not obtrusive.  One thing I will remark on (having read many of the reviews below) is that the price is EXCELLENT for what you receive.  For some reason, everyone seems to think that Thai food should be cheap.  The food at Mengrai is miles ahead of your average Thai restaurant (sorry, Spring Rolls).  The prawns are huge (because we were two, they gave us four prawns in an app. that was supposed to have three!), the meat is tender and the seasonings are expert.  The chef, Sasi, even runs a cooking school which, when we were there, was just ending a session.  The students sat at the table next to us and began to compare notes - they were all chefs and were talking about the various restaurants they worked at.  Clearly, Mengrai has something to offer if other chefs are studying there?  Mengrai is very reasonably priced considering the style of service and quality of food.  For two people to eat until we were full, plus a bottle of good wine, we spent $74 before taxes and tip - a steal, in my books.  Imagine what you'd get at Jack Astors for the same money?  The only criticism I would have of Mengrai is the numbered menu.  Maybe if people couldn't order by number they'd stop expecting food court prices?"}
{"text":"This is Thai food for hipsters. We ordered the morning glory, Sasi pad Thai, and beef tenderloin with Pom reduction. We found the food were oily and a lot more expensive than other Thai restaurants in town. We had the pineapple cheesecake for dessert which we couldn't taste any pineapple in it."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the city.  The owners are lovely, the food is always really tasty and they deliver.  I've tried others and this is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"As I head into a food coma, I just wanted to thank all of the yelpers who helped put me here.    The place and even the dish tonight were based purely on yelp reviews and the meal did not disappoint.  The number 54, aka Red Curry Chicken w/ lychee & pineapple is not something that I would traditionally order for Thai takeout without some major coaxing, and for that, I thank you.  The food was delicious, though I am equally excited to visit the restaurant for a dine-in experience once I can master the art of chopsticks in public.  Good night."}
{"text":"Short version: This is the best Thai restaurant in Toronto, better than Khao San Road , Pad Northern Thai Kitchen, or any other well-known Thai place downtown.  One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Everything from start to finish was magnificent. You must, must go here.  Long version:  My mum was in town and I was hoping to take her to Pad Northern Thai, but they were booked up on the evening we wanted to visit. We weren't going to order takeout, or wait around for hours for a table at Khao San Road, so I searched for Thai restaurants in the east end on Yelp and it led me here.  I saved the restaurant's number on my phone that morning, to call and make a reservation later. Somehow, I must have dialled the number accidentally, because I received a call from the owner around 11.30am. Not only did he go out of his way to call me back and take my booking, but he kept me on the phone for over five minutes chatting (in a genuine, not a creepy way), telling me about the restaurant, where to find it and what dishes he would particularly recommend. He told me that Mengrai had received the official approval of the Thai government for its authenticity in cuisine, something no other restaurant in Canada has achieved. I was blown away by his friendliness and passion for his business!  After talking with the owner, my expectations were high. After locating the restaurant on the slightly deserted and sketchy corner of Richmond and Ontario, we were seated by a wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable server, whose name unfortunately escapes me. Welcoming and chatty but not in our faces, and knowledgeable and helpful about the menu without being pushy, he made our evening a delight.  At his recommendation, all three of us ordered the restaurant's speciality - thai red curry served in a pineapple. The kitchen had no problem in adjusting the spicyness level to adjust my mum's milder preferences, whilst my boyfriend and I stuck to the traditional spice level (6/10 spicy as described by the server).  The presentation of the curry, atop a half-cut pineapple, was stunning. The chicken itself was gorgeous. I'm not sure who Mengrai's suppliers are, but it was top-notch quality. The sauce for the curry was the perfect consistency and mind-blowingly flavourful and aromatic. This was all rounded off by the juice from the pineapple slowly seeping into the curry, giving the dish an extra sweet and unique feel. Absolutely amazing; after one bite you will easily see how this dish has won so many awards.  I was too stuffed to order dessert, and I'm not usually a dessert and especially not a cheesecake person, but after sampling my mum's cheesecake, I was tempted to order one of my own. It was so good, I still think about it. That's quite an accolade from someone who usually recoils at the thought of cheesecake!  The meal wasn't cheap, but this is truly one of those restaurants where its worth every cent. The layout and decor of the restaurant is also gorgeous. It's intimate and romantic while still maintaining a casual, spacious feel.   I'm leaving Toronto for good soon and this meal will stay with me forever. I really encourage everyone to go here - especially those who are tired of the long lines and rushed service at the better-known Thai restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"All around excellent - Service, FOOD, atmosphere. We were in a large group, so were dining from the Prix Fixe menu. Heard lots of great things about this restaurant, but they really exceeded my expectations. From the time we sat down, all staff was friendly and attentive, through to the moment we were walking out the door. I'll have to admit, that when they first placed our first course appetizer platters in front of us, I questioned the size of the servings as they did seem kind of minimal, making me wonder if our entrées would be meager helpings as well. Those worries disappeared after they served our main course, consisting of 4 dishes (1 vegetarian, 3 non-vegetarian) in front of us, to be enjoyed \"family-style,\" alongside steamed jasmine rice. Healthy sized dishes of wonderful, fragrant and flavourful food. I couldn't get enough of the #54 Red Curry Chicken, which was made with lychees and fresh pineapple. Sweet and delicious. Make sure you have lots of rice to go with this, so that you can enjoy every last bit of this sauce.  Our meal was capped off by the Mango Snowball, which was described as sweet coco crème sticky rice with fresh mango and tropical ice cream. It was a lovely combination of flavours and textures, and the perfect end to our dinner.   What is also great about this restaurant is that they are sensitive to and will adjust for dietary restrictions and allergies, including gluten/wheat-free, peanut, seafood, halal, vegan and vegetarian.   This was a great experience, and I would love to go back again."}
{"text":"I went here for a private function and the food was presented buffet style. The regular and spicy pad thai were slimy in texture - as someone else mentioned it tasted watered down. I've been to Thailand a few times so I have an idea of what the food should generally taste like."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.    I've never eaten in as a proper diner, but I've attended two parties where Mengrai catered, and one party held at the restaurant.     All 3 times the food was delicious and fresh.    My cousins, who keep having these Mengrai Thai parties, have always been happy with the service, the staff, and the food.  One of these days I'll have to go for a proper sit-down dinner!"}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars only for having good service. The food was atrocious. Tasteless, greasy, and the seafood seemed off. If you're from Vancouver or anywhere else with vibrant, flavorful Thai food, you'll be left totally disappointed. I had their house specials - Sasi's pad Thai and the red curry with lychee and pineapple. They told me the pad Thai would be rich - it was watered down and bland. The ingredients in the curry were so off that my uncle thought a lychee was an oyster. Avoid! Sad if this is the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Mengrai Thai catered our office lunches a few times (including today), and every time food and service are excellent!   Portions are generous and selection is very good. Their red chicken curry with lychees is famous for a reason: hot, sweet, savoury, with a hint of kaffir lime.  Yum!"}
{"text":"So last night, in the cold, my SO and I decided to forgo a traditional romantic Valentines Day dinner and instead go for something more near and dear to our hearts. Thailand. having both traveled through the country extensively, Thai food has a special place in our hearts.   Nestled on Ontario Street, South of Queen Mengrai is a beautiful Loft-Like restaurant with exposed brick, Thai furnishings, traditional axe pillows and servers in traditional dress. It is beautiful. Definitely a more formal restaurant, they operate on seatings.. meaning you can book for 6:00 or 8:30. Although the restaurant is large, they sat the couples side by side instead of spacing us out, meaning we had a couple 2 feet from us on either side, with an entire half the restaurant empty the entire time. We were practically involved in everyones conversations, would have been nice to have some space.   Being a more upscale restaurant, They do serve alcohol including full bottles of wine.  Mains are on the expensive side for asian fare in the $13-$20 range.   We ordered vegetarian spring rolls for appetizers which were $6 and while clearly homemade, were more wrapper than filling. They paled in comparison to Sukothai's which offer more flavour and roll for half the price. We split the Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai which tasted authentic and had a generous portion of shrimp. Highlight of the meal.   My SOs dined on the green curry (chicken) while I dined on the red (vegetarian). The bowls were beautiful and the rice came in little steel pots. Mine was OK.  Overall I did not find the food to be all that spectacular. The curry was missing something, definitely heat.  The server while attentive to plate cleaning etc, seemed confused. We had an issue with our bill, but it was settled with no problem. They added the gratuity.   Food was OK, Service OK, Beautiful Space which makes for a really special time. Save this for an occasion though. Spring Rolls, Two Curry, pad Thai and Two drinks was $93.    one full star for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Have been going to Mengrai Thai ever since it opened a few years ago.  The service has been excellent each and every time.  I especially like the servers that work there... they all have great personalities, are professional and extremely pleasant to deal with.  Testimonials are available from movie stars that have found it a great place to eat when they are in Toronto.  The food is really good.  Very tasty and excellent presentation.    The atmosphere is unique... the historical value of an old Toronto building combined with a traditional Thai feel.  Pretty cool!  As other reviews have stated already it can be a bit pricey... but, nowadays you can't find much that isn't.    A hidden gem in my opinion.  The place is almost hidden on the corner of Richmond and Ontario... and it is easy to miss driving by.  Totally recommended!  I'm looking forward to attempting the cooking lessons they have available there.  :)"}
{"text":"Service is not bad, but it's the food that will keep you coming back. Standouts are the Sasi Pad Thai and Lemongrass Creme Brule. And the coconut lemongrass soup is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great!!  Yes, the restaurant is on a bit of a desolate block - but once you are inside you couldn't care less where you are!  I made a reservation for myself and six others - this was a bit of a reunion of friends who had previously traveled Southeast Asia together so we were looking for authentic cuisine to satisfy our cravings. They didn't disappoint!  Ended up taking a later reservation than planned because the restaurant tries to offer two seatings rather than having everyone bunched around the 7-7:30 arrival time. It all worked out fine with an 8 o'clock reservation - we were all a bit early but our table and server were ready for us.  First of all, the service was great - the server was friendly, helpful, and didn't seem too busy even though the restaurant was full on a Friday night. He was patient with us as we pondered what to order, he made recommendations, and he was more than happy to split things on the cheques many ways etc. Also FYI, plan to pay in cash and there could be a bit of a discount in store for you :)  As for the food... Mango Salad with Chicken Skewers - yummy salad, even if the mango wasn't as green as might be expected. The chicken skewers were nicely done, but the satay sauce was rather thick - unfortunately not really on the same line as authentic peanut satay sauce in Malaysia. This appetizer could be shared if you are just interested in giving these treats a try before dinner.  #54 (Red Curry with Chicken, Pineapple, and Lychee, served in a pineapple) - a yummy, unique curry. Definitely has some heat, in case that is something you are concerned about. There was plenty of fruit and chicken. No complaints - would definitely order again :)  Mango Sticky Rice - a good desert to share - after dinner you may not really feel like more dessert but this is a nice finish with fresh mango. It is a generous serving so plan to share since it is a bit too sweet to eat lots of.  Chocolate cake - surprisingly this also has a bit of heat as well. Overall, a nice change from standard chocolate cakes.  It had been a couple years since I had been to Mengrai but I won't be waiting that long to return for a third time!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Thai restaurant in the city.   Located in an unsuspecting old warehouse with brick, beam and old equipment build into the the decor lets you know you are in for something special.  The food is phenomenal. I have sampled half the menu from the curried to the pad Thais and every time it's not only perfect and delicious but has an added touch of care and presentation. Little touches such as serving curry in half a pineapple or including lychee in the mix out this place a cut above the rest. And don't be afraid to try some of the more exotic dishes like fried morning glories."}
{"text":"Oh. So. Good.  Owned by the same gracious family behind the now-no-more Sasi thai restaurant (close to Ryerson), Mengrai Thai scores major points in all categories of service, atmosphere, and gets a freaking Oscar for food.   My dining partner and I were seated next to a glimmering golden shrine featuring religious relics with a spattering of plastic figurines and what appeared to be a miniature grey Mazda model car. Hm. The place is relatively busy considering it is a little bit off the beaten path. Using a bit of triangulation, we suspect that our server is the owner's son. Either way, he, like all the other servers, are fresh-faced, smiling, and appear genuinely proud to be serving us.   Starting with the appetizers for two, with an array of usual fare (spring rolls, cold rolls, shrimp triangles). Good, but nothing to get too excited about.  This, of course, all changes with the arrival of the entrees. Their famous #54 Red Curry Chicken with Lychees is presented in a hollowed out pineapple. We get a bowl of rice with it. It is amazingly good. I initially didn't realize that there were lychees in it, and the taste of it brought about a pleasing floral taste to it. Tons of good sauce, we wish there was more rice on the side to sop it all up.  We also tried their Pad Thai (Street Style) - and mmmm, it's good. A healthy serving of noodles with large shrimps, chicken, hot pepper flakes on the side, and a sprinkling of what appears to be freshly crushed peanuts. Delicious. Not as delicious as #54, but delicious all the same. We're stuffed.  We are comfortable enough around our server to get chatting with him, and he's all smiles. We order their mango dessert with his recommended ginger ice cream. It is a perfect sweet treat to share at the end of a filling meal. To our surprise when we get the bill, he's been kind enough to give us the dessert on the house. Whaddaguy!  I'll be back here soon, and hope to bring some friends with me next time. This is a real authentic family establishment that's got a whole lot of heart, and they deserve all the praise they are getting.    (Note: the takeout menu appears to offer the same items at a relatively cheaper price. The extra cost to eat in the resto is worth it for the presentation and courteous service.)"}
{"text":"A nice place; warm atmosphere, friendly service, good Thai food.  I have to say though, starting at $14 just for providing well-presented, authentic Thai entrees is a bit of a stretch.  Special occasions only.  But I'm a cheapskate, so ignore me if money is not an issue for you."}
{"text":"Super eclectic place, easy to get a reservation.  I ordered morning glory Thai style which wasn't on the menu and they did a great job with it.  Great curry, great pad Thai.  Ordered a Thai iced tea and tasted very off.   Waitresses were new, need a bit more training.  Overall great find - would come back again. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Best thai in the city. the owner was invited to cook for king of Thailand! Filet bass was so delicious."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks back at a friend's behest. The food was good, and we ordered a whole bunch of both food and drink items. The owner was very friendly and kept bringing us free stuff. However I was somewhat underwhelmed by the way food tasted, perhaps because my expectations were too high. I had heard so many good things about the place that I had set the bar too high I think. I still think Khao San Road is much mich better in terms of quality (not so much service)"}
{"text":"Our large party who opted for prix fixe waited an hour before we finally got water. Our drink orders took forever, and even though we had ordered in advance for days, they had to re-ask us for our main options. One of our tables didn't have cutlery, we had to fetch it ourselves. They also ran out of all their Thai beer. They shouldn't offer prix fixe and accommodate for large groups if they can't handle it."}
{"text":"This place just rocks! I went there in early March, I had just written an exam on Saturday afternoon. I asked my hubby if we can go there for a late lunch. We did. We got a parking spot just outside the place. The tables were cute, with table cloths and the overall atmosphere was friendly and stylish.  I had red curry chicken, he had shrimps with pineapples. Absolutely delicious!!! If I lived downtown, I would be going there all the time!!! :) Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent...the service expectation fee was ridiculously inappropriate. As I posted on Facebook (slightly edited to avoid tagged people in the group)... \"You know, I just cannot believe how far we've come when it comes to self-entitlement expectations in regards to the service industry and tips. I was just out at a nearby Thai restaurant I had been to before, excellent food and myself and \"others\" had two pricey entrees, and a couple carafes of wine and tipped 15%, but his two young nieces that were with us got a separate bill and had the audacity to only pay 10% tip on it...would you believe the manager came over to first ask nicely if there was anything wrong with the service or the food, experience..etc.. We assured him not at all it was excellent. So he said oh..it's just that the tip was sub-standard as people usually pay a minimum of 15 - 20% of tip...he then comes back and throws the receipt in front of the two girls and they said yes it's our bill we did tip..we went on the pre-tax amount and...\"..he buts in \" well I'm not going to argue about it with you\"...picks up the bill and leaves. They are around 20 and 16. Do you not think that was ridiculously inappropriate?? I have always despised the way society has turned the so called gratuity into an expected new fee! Personally I think that kind of confrontation from a restaurant is outrageous.\""}
{"text":"Great food and great service. If you like Thai food this is the place to go.   The fixed price menu gives a great opportunity to try a lot of different tastes."}
{"text":"Love mengrai Thai. We always order takeout from here, they are very friendly and always deliver quickly and hot food. The coconut soups and red curry chicken are my favourite. I have also eaten at the restaurant once and service was good. I always take their recommendations on what to order and they never disappoint. Best Thai in Toronto."}
{"text":"In a sea of restaurants that serve common \"Thai\" dishes on their menu, I was so happy to see a list of unique menu items at Mengrai Gourmet Thai.  Red curry chicken with lychee and braised curry lamb with peaches, to name a few.  From the very first bite to the very last, it was a Thai royal treatment experience all the way.  I love, love the grilled beef tenderloin with pomegranate tamarind reduction.  The beef tenderloin slices were tender, smokey and flavorful.  They were presented on a bed of perfectly steamed vegetables. The pomegranate tamarind reduction was divine!  The reduction paired superbly with the beef.  The best part of this dish for me was eating it with sticky rice using my hand.  Dipping a ball of rice in the rich and tasty sauce with a piece of beef on top, just like back home.  The sticky rice was served in a very cute, small traditional bamboo sticky rice container.  Chef Sasi's Pad Thai Noodle was also splendid.  The homemade Pad Thai sauce was balanced.  I loved the saltiness from the sun dried baby shrimp.  The chicken was succulent.  The tiger shrimp was nicely done.  It was smokey.  The crunchy texture from some chopped peanuts completed the dish.  All around, it was a spectacular Pad Thai.  It reminded me of home.  The crispy jumbo prawns, although not original, was prepared just right.  The prawn was juicy.  The batter was golden and crunchy.  The two desserts were equally terrific.  If you prefer a lighter sweet, I highly recommend the pineapple cheese cake with coconut crumbs.  It was a tropical piece of heaven!  And, if you are a chocolate person with a hint of hotness hidden inside, like me, the spiced flourless chocolate cake was oh ... so rich and yummy.  The combination was wonderful.  Service was excellent.  The staff was extremely personable, polite and accommodating.    The food at Mengrai Gourmet Thai made me feel right at home.  I enjoyed Chef Sasi's culinary creations and her expertise.  Chef Sasi's ability to create something unique using fresh herbs and spices, executing it without compromising the tastes and maintaining Thai traditional style of cooking is captivating.  I'm looking forward to returning and sample the rest of her signature dishes."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch.  I was surprised to see that they are only open Thursdays and Fridays for lunch.  I had the chicken and shrimp lunch special.  It was delicious.  The spring roll was just the right bite size.  The shrimp triangles were very cute.  The sauce drizzled around them were tasty.  I had the original Pad Thai and it was really good.  The mix of noodles and peanut with the tamarind sauce was tangy and had the authentic feel that I don't get from Pad Thai's mixed with tomato.  My lunch companion had the lemongrass coconut soup and she enjoyed that very much.  I would like to go back with a larger group and have more tastings as this experience was so delectable!"}
{"text":"I did a Thai cooking class here with 4 friends at the end of January and the owner Allan forgot to give us the recipes. I contacted him the day after and he said he would send me the recipes electronically. It's been a month and a half and I have messaged him for the recipes a few times and he has yet to respond or send them. Worst part is he added me on Facebook so I can see him constantly posting online while ignoring my messages."}
{"text":"After the closure of my favorite yet often overlooked Thai restaurant (Sala Thai on Eglinton), I feared I would never find a good Thai place in Toronto again. While the city boasts a plethora of Asian restaurants, most of them are sub-par, especially when it comes to Thai food. Fortunately, my friend found this place and recommended it to me highly. I took his recommendation and recently attended with a group of four.  We shared the red curry chicken, green curry beef and Sasi's pad thai. All were equally impressive and far outmatched the curries and pad thais I have had elsewhere. Clearly, there was an attention to detail in the ingredients used that you do not find at most places. The only real downsides were the sticky rice, a gelatinous pile of goop that appeared to be sitting for far too long and the location. It sucks to have to drive this far to get decent Thai food in a city that should be brimming with high-quality options."}
{"text":"Food:  Not as flavourful as most Thai restaurants I've been to. I prefer Salad King or Thai Express.   Ambience/ Atmosphere: The place is dingey and there were flies swarming around. Plus, the tables and chairs are wobbly. In fact, the waiter noticed and came around to put cardboard under our tables and said \"this is embarrassing\" ... Self explanatory that the wait staff is embarrassed by the condition of the restaurant. However, aside from the flies and the wobbly table and chairs, the place does look  nice.   Location: If you live around the area, the place is great. However, for those that have to commute. There's no real direct way to get here. It's on Richmond. So you'd have to get off on the Queen street car right in the ghetto and walk a block. Would not recommend going here late nights (the stop is on Queen street at night is pretty sketchy). Not for the faint at heart."}
{"text":"I love Mengrai.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but I love going and love taking friends to this location over other Thai options. They have a ton of veggie options and cater to multiple different food preferences."}
{"text":"This place is pure money.  Great food, great service, great ambience, and great prices!!!  If that wasn't enough, they have a rather incredible all-you-can-eat lunch buffet every Thursday serving a varied assortment of the favorite dishes off the regular menu.  Different dishes on the buffet every week, and lots of veggie choices for those not carnivorously inclined.  We go at LEAST once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Thai restaurants in Toronto. There are a lot of good Thai restaurants in Toronto! But, Mengrai is definitely a restaurant that stands out from the others!  For starters, it's not loud and trendy.  You can hear each other talk! I like that you can make reservations here and have a nice dinner with amazing thai food!  The restaurant has a few parking spaces in front, but it's not too far a walk from Queen subway station.  The space is much larger and decorative than I expected. The gold buddha and elephant wall statue is a nice touch!  Photo worthy!  We were seated by the window and the owner was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Okay, the lychee martinis are freaking amazing. Like, I want a pitcher of martini amazing.  For an appetizer, I really enjoyed the Divine Crispy Morning Glory and  pumpkin soup ($9.00).  The soup was sweet with a nice kick.  The fritters were crispy and delicious!  The tenderloin with pomegranate tamarind reduction ($22.95) was sweet and savoury.  I really enjoyed the flavours!  However, they undercooked the beef. :(  We also had the popular red Chicken curry with lychee and pineapple ($18.50). The presentation is really pretty since the curry is served in a carved out pineapple.  The portion was large as well, I really loved this dish with coconut rice!  For dessert, we had the pineapple cheesecake with coconut ($ 8.50) and the   mango snowball with ginger ice cream ($4.00).  Both desserts were excellent and not too sweet!  I'd have to say that out of the two, I preferred the mango snowball.  It was different and the ginger ice cream was surprising not too gingery and I really liked the textures of this dessert.  Overall, we had a wonderful dinner here.  However, there were a few hiccups with the service but the food was great!  I'll be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food - goes beyond your traditional Thai fare. Even better than some places in Thailand."}
{"text":"Amazing food and equally amazing people! Great lamb curry and a very good and unique pineapple fried rice. Alan and his wife, the chief, were very welcoming. If you are in Toronto, this is a must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"Best, most authentic Thai food I've had! Tasted amazing and presented in a unique way. Wow! The service is incredible. They refilled my water 11 times!  The manager also gave us a bowl of rice on the house.  Beautiful experience."}
{"text":"The nicest Thai restaurant I have been to in Toronto. You pay for what you get -- it is a nice night out but not overpriced and definitely worth every penny.  Chef Sasi calls herself \"Canada's most famous Thai chef\" but I think she deserves it. She makes the classics well, and also presents innovative dishes that you simply won't find anywhere else.  Professional service that nonetheless did not loose the traditional Thai friendliness. The place itself is quite large but divided up into smaller rooms -- so it is great for an intimate dinner but also has room for large groups. Would be a great place for a birthday party!  For starters we had chicken satay and mango salad which were very competent and classic. They lacked a bit of heat, though, but that was remedied with some hot sauce. The satay was moist and flavourful. Also had the pumpkin soup which was out of this world -- a must try!  Our mains consisted of an excellent coconut red curry soup with a whole lobster -- simply divine and flawless. The large chunks of coconut carved from the serving coconut shell really added to the texture. Chef Sasi's #64 red curry with lychees and prawns was as good a red curry as I've ever had. The presentation in a pinapple was inspired, and I liked the fact that the lychees themselves were stuffed with prawn. Lots of large, fresh (not frozen) prawns were served in the dish but it is a bit sweet so next time I would opt for chicken. Vegetarian pad thai was also excellent. Sticky rice was served properly -- in a plastic bag and not a stupid banana leaf!  Decent drink and wine list and the dinner went very well with an Ontario Riesling. Unfortunately, we had to pour our own wine which was the only flaw in the service.  We were too stuffed for dessert so portion sizes are definitely decent.   If you like Thai food and want more than a hole-in-the-wall casual eatery, then you can't go wrong with Mengrai. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my husband and I to come here on Valentines day and was surprised I was able to get one so easily.  We reached there at 8.30 and were show to our table immediately by a smiling server. After seating us he came back within 5 mins to take our order (we placed our order all together, drinks, appetizers and main course). I think they did that since they wanted to be quick and had more reservations. We didn't mind it, just a bit odd.   Drinks: Lycee Martini (a bit too sweet for my liking), Bloody Caesar (really good)  Appetizers: Shared a platter for two (nothing different, but all really well made)  Main Course: #54 Signature dish (Superb!), Tapalia in Tamarind Sauce (OK), Coconut Rice (Yummmm!)  We didn't have deserts so... no comments.  The was one of the better thai places I have been to and would definitely go back to try more of their dishes.  But what put me off about the place was how dirty it felt. Its not a cheap place, very dish is around $20+ and your bill will surely come to $100, so I except the place to exude a level of cleanliness. The place where we were seated was downstairs and was mush less clean from the place upstairs. The seat cover was stained and the floor was covered with specks of dirt and there was a dirty cloth lying under my seat. I think the next time I would prefer to get a table on the main level."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The old website incorrectly states it's closed, but it's still open.  Food is delicious.  I love the curry that comes in the Pinapple with coconut rice. The pad thai and cashew check are also great. It's a super cozy spot for a nice meal with friends or low key date!!!  Very friendly service.  I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Came with six ladies and we were all impressed! Food and service were both excellent. The atmosphere was beautiful. Bring cash with you!"}
{"text":"As always, Mengrai exceeds expectations.   Last night I arrived with a couple of girlfriends from out of town at 7:30pm with no reservation. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the best idea, because it was packed on a Saturday night, but it was a last minute decision to go. We took a chance and it all worked out. The friendly staff did some shuffling and critical thinking to find us a table, and we only waited about 5 minutes.   We ordered the shellfish-free version of their mango salad to start, and all 3 of us shared. The portions at Mengrai are generous, so \"family style\" eating is the way to go. For dinner we ordered coconut rice, #54 Curry (out-of-this-world), chicken pad Thai, & a veggie red curry. Every dish was top notch (5 stars). They asked us how hot we wanted each dish on a scale of 1 to 10 and they nailed it for each one.   I have to give a call-out to our waiter, Brendon. He was excellent. Asked if we had visited before, took time to fully explain the menu to the one in our crew who had not, made suggestions for must-have items, was patient, accommodating, timely and had a good sense of humor. Another mention is that service is generally fast at Mengrai because they have a flurry of hands available to help with running food, sweeping tables and generally just getting things done efficiently. All of the staff are friendly and helpful.   Total for 3 people was ~$100 plus tip. Very reasonable considering we each had 1 alcoholic beverage, and brought home leftovers!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Great food too. They truly make you feel like you are a special customer. The interior has a very authentic feel to it as well."}
{"text":"I visited Mengrai thai knowing that it is one of the highly rated Thai restaurants in the GTA and my expectations were high. One of my best, if not the best food trip I've ever had was in Phuket , Thailand so if I can enjoy a meal even remotely close to that experience in Toronto I'd be a happy man.  I had fish on curry, mango salad, vegetables, chicken but sadly, nothing really stands out. The food was good but it wasn't amazing as the prices would have you believe.  I have a great (and I do mean great) Thai cookbook by David Thompson and the dishes I've concocted using its recipes are relatively more impressive.  3 stars because although the food is good, the prices sort of pull the rating down."}
{"text":"Incredible?, authentic, and beautiful Thai food. I've been here twice in a row with my bf for our anniversary and when they found out it was our second time celebrating with them, they gave us champagne and a dessert on the house!! And we got to meet the chef!!  The service is fantastic, and you NEED to try the red snapper, it's to die for.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was delicious Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..... that was the noise I made when eating the lychee red curry.  P.S. the water they serve tastes really good"}
{"text":"Considering I don't like Thai food, I enjoyed my food (healthy cashew nut stir fry with beef). Others at my table did not enjoy there's as much. The wait was HORRIBLE. It took long just to get menus and dessert menus. The mango sticky rice wasn't good, but the mango cheesecake was. I wouldn't come back here though, the wait and heat was too much to bare."}
{"text":"If we had to sum this place up in one sentence it would be \"Top notch food and top notch service.\" It's fairly priced and has a very home-like ambience! It's our favourite thai place!"}
{"text":"Wowza! This place is fan-effin-tastic! My \"life partner\" and I went to this place when it was very snowy and gross out yet this place was really busy and I imagine that it'd be packed when the weather's not being all douchey. You don't have to don your best duds but it's a more upscale kind of restaurant. The menu has a great variety of dishes (for carnivores and herbivores) including the standard pad thai and curries.  We shared the mixed spring rolls - 6 pieces: 3 standard crispy spring rolls and 3 taro rolls with a web-like crispy outer wrap - deeelicious! I had the Vegetarian Tibetan Mountain Bai Ling mushrooms with mixed greens while my life partner had some kind of fish dish (if I can't eat it, then I don't pay attention). We ordered coconut rice but they brought us plain steamed rice (I really wish I had a backbone and could just speak up but alas, i am such a wuss). My dish was so wonderful and savoury! I believe they were king oyster mushrooms and other types that I couldn't identify but it all tasted heavenly and the portions are abundant. In the end, I had to take half of it home because the quantity was enough for two meals. When they brought it back with no rice, I made the life partner request an extra rice. He told them that they gave us plain rice instead of the coconut rice and they brought us a plain one on the house and gave us a free bowl of delicious coconut (at least I think it was coconut) ice cream. They were so friendly and apologetic, I couldn't fault them for bringing the plain rice in the first place and charging us for the coconut rice. Our mega awesome meal (two dishes and one appetizer) came to about $55.  More than the average thai meal but worth it!"}
{"text":"This was really highly recommended but I was very disappointed. The Pad Thai was dry and bland and the the special red curry dish with lychee and pineapple was just weird.   Staff was very friendly and pleasant though."}
{"text":"First time here over the winter was quite good. However seems like things have deteriorated quite a bit. Went back past weekend and we ordered a Panang and a Green curry to share with some jasmine rice. Both were very flavourless yet too spicy (even though we asked for medium, which is what we would ask for at salad king, pai, thai one on, etc). Felt like they just loaded it up with chillies but none of the authentic flavours that Thai food is so famous for. Probably one of the blandest thai food experiences I've had in Toronto outside of food courts. Would have given it a 5/10 but giving it a 1/10 because 2/6 people in our group had stomach issues a couple of hours later. Disappointed as we really liked the place last time. Don't know what happened."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago with my friend Stanley and again more recently with my friend Jennifer. Stanley and myself rarely agree or like the same restaurants but this one we agreed, mediocre at best. The service was good and it was steady busy. The food generally seemed to be overly sweet in taste. I've never noticed this with Thai food except this time when Jennifer mentioned it several times.. I have been trained in Thai Cooking, I know the ingredients to be used, I can only assume for what ever reason this place adds sugar. The food itself for me was just ok, the desert was a disappointment and the price wasn't high for good food but it wasn't good, it was just ok. The room was very nice and makes for a nice experience. I like the space. This is one of those hidden spots that has ok food, great room, and good service. I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food...and gorgeous decor...very attentive staff...great place... I used to think Bangkok Garden was the premier Thai place in Toronto...until I came here."}
{"text":"I've had better Thai food in Scarborough and paid a fraction of the price for it. For 2 ppl the bill rang up to be around 70.  The food wasn't bad but I expected more. I felt like this place is    overhyped. What we ordered was supposed to have shrimp. It came without shrimp. When we pointed it out. Rather than serving us what we ordered they gave us a small plate with 5 or 6 little prawns in it. It's like asking for chocolate chip cookies and having cookies with the chocolate served separately."}
{"text":"I though this place was great. We were a big group and ordered about 15 different dishes to share for take-out. Everything was tasty and I'm sure it would have been even better if eaten in the restaurant. One of the better Thai restaurants in the city for sure. I tried: Curry with seafood, beef and Lychee. Phad thai, Pineapple rice, Glass noodles, spicy shrimp and multiple others. I liked everything.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review is for the takeout only. The prices and menu vary immensely from the dine in to takeout as I was surprised how reasonable the prices were for take out. The location is a bit off the beaten path and one is surprised to find this kind of restaurant in this neck of the woods.  We ordered the following Yam Rolls (though said to be vegetarian they did have some shrimps) Panang Curry Chicken (Decent) Red Curry Chicken (Good and I will try it again when dinning in for sure)  Cashew Chicken (OK) Fried rice with vegetables (I didn't like it much but the fellow diners enjoyed the sheer amount of veggies that were in there) They do deliver a fact that would have helped as this is not a place where one wants to roam around. 3.5 Stars and I am tempted to come back for the dine in option."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It is very cosy inside and our server happened to be someone I went to high school with which was a nice surprise!   I have driven by the place so many times, but never knew it was a thai restaurant. Meter parking is quite ample on Richmond Street East. And it's in a pretty convenient location.  I just loved everything I had and the portions are generous. If you are having the mango salad to start, I'd suggest sharing it...it's quite large as a starter but good for a meal.  I had the Green Curry with Shrimp with coconut rice. My friend had the Red Curry Chicken with lychee and pineapple. Both were so delicious. We were too full to order anything else and took home some leftovers.  Everyone was very accommodating and friendly and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting and there was NO overpowering music. The volume was perfect.  Just a really nice experience overall and at less than $100 (before tip) for four glasses of wine, two starters and two entrees...I'd say that's a pretty good deal for downtown Toronto!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I now have two favorite Thai food restaurants in the whole wide world. I wanted to thank our waitress Alice who was excellent and very attentive.  I would recommend ordering...  Lychee Martini  Chicken Satai  Pad Thai  Cashew Chicken  Tom Kha - It's not on the actual menu but I had inquired to see if that was what the coconut soup was. It wasn't but they said that they could make me some Tom Kha anyway. I pondered ordering it but I figured there was going to be too much food and I didn't want my eyes to be bigger than my stomach. Much to my surprise they made a little sample for me since my friends were having pumpkin soup and they \"didn't want me to feel left out\". Awww!!! That was so thoughtful of the waitress and chef. I really enjoyed my soup. It was AMAZING!!! I tried the pumpkin soup and while it was good, I preferred my Tom Kha and wish that I had ordered more.  I had a great time here. This turned out to be my favorite restaurant in the city. I will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Big vegetarian/vegan selection and the food is delicious! The staff are kind and the owner is lovely and seems to work hard at building relationships with his customers."}
{"text":"We would rate the meal at a 2.5 stars. The host,a gentleman was very helpful with helping us select an appetizer and a cocktail. Our server was polite but inattentive, the main coarse's were just mediocre. No return from server to check on mains and bus boy put the hot sauce we requested on the wrong table. I will leave you to draw your own conclusion..."}
{"text":"Omg. The best Thai restaurant in town. Braised beef is a best try!!!! The owner Allan was super friendly too, he talked to us a lot about treetop charity, he was very passionate about the charity work he and his team does. I had a great time listening to his stories. Would love to come back for more yummy food and listen to more of Allan's stories!! Love."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Dining at the place where movie stars come. Can you say hole in the wall restaurants, yes. Recommend the Red Curry  chicken"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Canada and i would say the food was pretty decent. The place looks scary when you enter but is very secluded and cozy. It takes forever to place an order but oncr you get the food, you will enjoy it. They serve pineapple froed rice in an actual pineapple which was pretty good. Pad thai and veg spring rolls were decent too, just a tad oily but that is expected. Note: keep an eye out alot of Bollywood and Hollywood actors have visited this place, you might get lucky!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to say bad about this place. The service was good and the atmosphere was also great. I am a vegetarian and the menu had good veg delicacies. The veg platter was good, tom yum veg soup was very flavourful, the red royal curry was delicious and the cranberry lychee drink was so relaxing. Will definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"I've lived between the borders of Jarvis/Sherbourne/Adelaide and Queen for almost 12 years now and thought I'd discovered all of its secrets.  I'm not only a lover of Thai food but of Thailand itself and seek authenticity the food it has to offer which leaves me with not a lot of choice in Toronto, despite the number of \"Thai\" restaurants out there.  So I was truly amazed when I stumbled across this gem in my very own backyard.  Despite the years it has been in operation, I had never heard about it. From the moment I walked in the door I was transported back to Thailand. I'm so thrilled to have found a place that serves the real deal including deep fried morning glory.  The chicken with lychees, as so many others have mentioned, truly is to die for.  And not a trace of ketchup in the Pad Thai - sadly a favourite ingredient of oh so many \"Thai-style\" haunts in North America it seems. The staff go absolutely out of their way to please - a Five Star Service all round.  Mengrai appeals to my philanthropic nature.  Chef Sasi and her husband support a \"home-grown\" charity in Chiangrai, supporting a local village through an eco-farm run primarily through volunteer backpackers.   Being able to dine in the knowledge that I'm giving back too is a bonus! Highly recommend this and now dine there regularly."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, friendly service.  Their red curry chicken with pineapple and lychee was one of the best curry dishes I have had.  I think I also saw some kaffir lime leaves in the dish as well which is a nice touch.  Curried pumpkin soup and pad thai were also good.  Some dishes were just ok, but nothing wrong with that given many dishes stood out positively."}
{"text":"Truly the tastiest Thai food in the city with the friendliest staff -- I have recommended Mengrai to many happy people. If you looked them up online and thought they had closed, apparently their website was hacked. Luckily, they are still serving chef Sasi's delicious recipes. Followed them to their current location from their old Jarvis St. storefront and will keep going as long as they're around."}
{"text":"very nice and authentic thai food. Love their curry dishes."}
{"text":"You know classy Indian or Chinese food that you pay a premium for and you feel like you would have enjoyed it better if it were some hole in the wall or shack with some grandmother ladeling you massive portions of food?  Well this is NOT the case here  This is one of the nicer Thai restos- more fine dining feel.  the price is definitely higher than a lot of the cheap thai you may be used to but I would say it is worth it for the quality- nothing about this place is your classic greasy fare.  Is it better than Khao san?  certainly not.  But you can make reservations, and even if you don't there will likely be tables avail (huge resto), and it is a dimmer, more intimate setting for catching up with friends or on a nice romantic date."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment.  This is rated the #3 Thai place in Toronto according to BlogTO.  What are they thinking???  This was one of the worst Thai meals I've had.  Bland and sugary.  ON THEIR ACTUAL MENU they talk about their amazing, award-winning chef.  If your chef is so good, why are you serving frozen spring rolls I can buy at Loblaws?  Terrible chicken satay.  The peanut sauce was decent, but the chicken was fatty and bland.  Pad Thai was decent, but very sweet and inauthentic for a dish labeled \"Classic Pad Thai\".  The \"Stir fried basil beef\" and the \"Mushroom and Tofu stir fry\" tasted EXACTLY the same.  Basically just spicy and sweet.  I could cook the same dish at home with tabasco and sugar.    The drinks were excellent, and the servers were fine, but this is food court level cuisine at restaurant prices.  If anyone reading this can recommend an actually good Thai place in Toronto, please send me a message."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype - this place is just normal.  I do not think this is as hyped up as everyone says.   I had planned my birthday dinner here, 2 weeks in advance. When I first called, I spoke to Allen, who spoke to me for over 1 hour just speaking on the restaurant, who goes there, how busy it is. Etc. he kept over emphasizing a minimum spend per person, and the difference being charged to my credit card if anyone didn't spend exactly that amount. I found it to be almost a bit pushy and pretentious.  I emailed him to confirm reservations for about 12, and he sent back an almost 4 page email, 2 pages were just the famous people that had eaten there, and the other two were pricing structures.  That email alone turned me off. It was too late to make other plans though so we still went.  SEE:  Beautiful restaurant, there are a lot of curtains instead of doors, it can get confusing. The space is well decorated, with emphasis on the Buddhist Thai culture.  HEAR:  I heard top 40 in the background kind of, at least I heard Justin Beiber softly singing LMAO.  TASTE: The food was okay. I have had better at KSR and in Mississauga at Yung Thai. I found the fried tofu to be a bit tough. The cashew nut curry tofu was okay. I don't know what it was but there were no sophisticated flavours and my palate was not particularly excited or pleased. It was just normal, almost bland food.    BAD: The service was subpar in some regards, but in some ways it was enough. My friend asked for chopsticks a few different times. I thought I had ordered from the prixe fix menu, but I only got two dishes from it, I really hope it was not billed the total price of the prixe fixe.  FEEL: I don't think this place is special.  FUTURE:  I wouldn't return specifically. Many better Thai resto's out there.   However, the company I was with made it a great time...as it was my Birthday Dinner and we went to Locus 144 after..makes me think I should have gone to Origin Liberty Village instead, if not for the 1 star yelp reviews on Origin LV.."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to, and probably amongst the best restaurants I've been to in general.   The food is beyond description, but I'll try. We ordered off of the lunch menu and had the Crispy Morning Glory (delicious!) and I had the Filet Stripe Bass Tamarind Coconut for my main. On the menu it says this might be the best fish dish you've ever had, and they are not lying.   It was the best fish dish I've ever had.   The stripe bass was cooked to perfection, it melted in my bloody mouth. The coconut tamarind sauce was creamy and spiced perfectly and added to the mouth-melty experience. It was a generous portion and I was stuffed afterwards, but if they had brought more out I would have eaten it with a smile.   Not to mention the service, which is wonderful. The owner, Allan, is probably one of the kindest people on the planet. This restaurant lacks for nothing, except that it's not closer to my house dammit. Or in my building. And Chef Sasi isn't my roommate/personal chef."}
{"text":"Wow ..  The service was beyond expectation. The ambience is nice. The waiter informed me that the building used to be a brewery which converted into this restaurant. We were a group of 8 and we got seated in a special section. The waiter and bar back were very informative and professional. The quality of service compared to the price point for food blew my mind.  We ordered the Lobster Royal Soup- which is one of the best things that I have ever tasted, think tom yum mixed with cocunut milk. My gosh! I am drooling by just reminiscing about it.  Since it was a large group- we ordered quite a lot of items. They were all delicious in their own way. It was a great time. Good food and good wine.  Worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I live up the street and am a real food snob. I've eaten in or taken out from this great Thai restaurant several dozen times and have always enjoyed their impeccably prepared and creative Thai dishes on every visit. Their striped bass and noodle dishes are outstanding!  It should be noted that their website was hacked recently saying they are out of business...which is not true. The new website adress is www.mengraithai.ca"}
{"text":"Such an interesting place! Love the atmosphere and decor. The Panang lamb curry was delicious! Wouldn't recommend the pineapple fried rice though, although the presentation was nice. Service was great even on a busy night. And cocktails were delish!"}
{"text":"Mengrai Gourmet Thai: Disappointing and lacklustre \"street\" pad thai, and pork fried rice.  Asked for the pad thai spicy and it was bland and reminiscent of ketchup on noodles, with the noodles a couple minutes past \"al dente\".   Sukho Thai's pad thai still ranks as number one in Toronto for us!  The pork fried rice was tastless as well, and did not contain BBQ pork, just overcooked beige colored slices of pig."}
{"text":"Lush decorations and the owner Alan, I believe is a pretty courteous (a previous yelper used jovial which I think is an apt description) and eager to please. The food is good too, seems quite authentic and uses good quality ingrediants for the most part. Except #54 which for $17 used canned lychees.... Pad Thai is not ketchupy at all, plump chicken used and the glass noodles are good too...with some veggies thrown in. All in all, this is a good place to go to when you want solid thai fare prepared in pretty surroundings, prices are a little steep though. Tip: prices for some dishes on the take out menu are cheaper!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, classic decor, and very personable service.  Our first meal in Toronto was exceptional and I would truly recommend the exceptional Thai cuisine at this restaurant.  Please enjoy the visually appealing photos that accompany my humble opinion about a great place to eat in this beautiful city of Toronto.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Thai cuisine! I had a red curry of some sort served in a pineapple. The contrasting spicy and sweet flavors from the curry and pineapple are unforgettable. Also the king prawn served with basil and lemon grass were amazing. Easily the best customer service I've received during my trip to Toronto. Left a lasting impression! 100% recommend to anyone visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the perfect combination of delicious and freshly made food, friendly staff, fair prices, great atmosphere, and caring and involved owners making sure everyone is happy.  The best restaurant experience I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I find Mengrai Thai very hit or miss. The first time I went, I was very impressed with the food. Service was quick. Food was tasty. The second and third time I've gone, service was much slower. Food came out at snail pace. The quality of food just wasn't there - there wasn't as much flavour or freshness as I experienced my first time visiting. For reference, I've ordered the same things every time I've visited. Also, not impressed by the fact that they used Lipton tea when I asked for green tea lol."}
{"text":"Over the past year, Mengrai has easily become my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. It's really tough to find quality Thai places that are authentic, creative and boast a great ambiance. Mengrai hits all three.   Food If the Head Chef (owners wife, I think) is cooking on the night you're there, you are in for a treat. She adds complexity to her dishes but still maintains a fine balance of Thai flavours. My favourite dishes are the following: Lemongrass Coconut Soup, Red Shrimp Curry with Lychees The Authentic Pad Thai, Ginger Chicken and Filet Stripe Bass Tamarind Coconut. My only negative comment would be that they sometimes skimp on shrimp and their appetizer's are a bit small.  Ambiance What an interesting location for a Thai restaurant. The exposed brick walls add so much warmth mixed in with modern/traditional Thai furnishing and accessories. Try to get the booth in the back. It's adorned with decorative pillows and is very cozy. It's made for 4 but we've squeezed 5-6 of us in the past.   Service For the most part it's usually right on, but at times you get the server who looks completely lost, or the one whose trying to add charges you've never seen before. The owner and his son are fabulous!  I can be very hard to please and Mengrai Thai always has me leaving  with a smile  ** JUST DON'T ORDER TAKE OUT! It's not their strong point. Their food is meant to be eaten on plates, not out of a box"}
{"text":"To be more accurate, I would give it an overall 3 1/2 stars.   Since it was Friday night, I made a reservation just in case even though it was later in the evening. As you enter the restaurant, you can see that it has a nice decor and ambience. The main focus was the Thai Buddha statue and the seats were decorated with Thai style triangular cushions.   2 of us ordered the prix fixed menu for 39$ while my boyfriend ordered 2 appetizers (the chicken satay and crispy jumbo prawns) and the beef panang curry as main course. The prix fixed came with a platter of appetizers (containing some mango salad, 1crispy prawn, 1chicken skewer, and a crispy wonton wrapper), Divine Crispy Morning Glory paired with golden pumpkin soup, and we chose the Red Chicken Curry with Lychee as main entrée. In term of taste, the appetizers were good but nothing to be wowed about. I was surprised by the pumpkin soup. It has a nice hint of coconut milk in it. They were creative with the Chicken curry with lychee since it not something you can find in all Thai restaurants. I had a taste of the panang curry my boyfriend has ordered. It was good but I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've had.   I did like the ambience and settings of the restaurant. The waitress was very attentive, our glasses of water were never empty and whenever she sensed that we needed something, she would be right at our table. The only minus is that halfway through our meal, we could clearly hear Allen, the owner/manager (I'm not too sure which he was, maybe both), complain about an employee to other employees. He continued on his rant for the rest of our meal. It just felt awkward and as clients of the restaurants we don't need to be hearing the problems and drama he has. After all we are there to enjoy a meal between friends."}
{"text":"Great thai food with a fantastic staff. My favorite dishes are their version of the pad thai and the lychee curry. Worth a visit, for sure!"}
{"text":"Dinner with a small group -- wonderful food, great for sharing, inventive."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Mengrai Wednesday evening and we were so impressed!   Although my friend had tried so much Thai food in many different cities and countries, he couldn't stop saying that this is absolutely the best Thai he'd ever had in Toronto and even in Canada!   I found it incredible that the flavour is so strong and tasty but at the same time the fish kept its own taste.   The waitress was super nice and so friendly. We were so happy that we made new friends! Glad that we decided on Mengrai.   We will definitely return again and recommend this restaurant to our friends!  P. S. We couldn't resist the delicious food and went there again on Friday, posted some photos..."}
{"text":"A long trek in search of food post Christmas market led us to Mengrai, we entered from the cold with empty stomachs in search of some spicy goodness, and we were not disappointed.   A group of 4 of us came to Mengrai on a Saturday night; we entered to a fairly busy restaurant with no reservation and were seated rather quickly. We decided to share 3 main dishes and an appetizer, the break down of the meal is as follows:   - Deep fried morning glory (appetizer): Our waiter recommended we order this to share; it was some sort of green leafy vegetable that was deep fried in a tempura like batter and served with a sweet and spicy sauce. This dish was quite good, the batter was not too thick on the vegetable and despite being deep fried it was not oily and perfectly crispy. The accompanying sauce was more sweet than spicy but was still good. The vegetable taste was unidentifiable as the batter and sauce overwhelmed everything.   - Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee: The presentation was quite cool as the curry was served in a hollowed out pineapple. The curry itself was rich and creamy with large pieces of chicken and lychee. The lychee imparted sweetness into the curry that was quite interesting. The lychee also served to mellow the spiciness of the dish and this turned out to be the least spicy dish we ordered.   - Sasi's Pad Thai noodle: Chef's special Pad Thai was excellent, in my limited experience with Thai food this was easily the best Pad Thai I have had. Served with shrimp, chicken and tofu this dish packed a nice kick. I believe it was made with shrimp paste which imparted a nice seafood flavour. The shrimp in the dish was nicely cooked; the chicken was a tad dry. The noodles had a nice bite and the peanuts on the side added a welcomed crunch, excellent dish.    - Crisp fillet whole red snapper with red curry sauce:  A very nice presentation as the fish was served whole. The body of the fish was cubed and lightly fried. The batter was excellent, very light and crispy. A lot of the times when a fish is battered and fried I find the natural taste of the fish gets lost however this was not the case here; I could still very much taste the fish. The accompanying red curry sauce had a big kick and complimented the fish very well.  - We also ordered some coconut rice and sticky rice which were key in sopping up all the curries and sauces we were served.  - Coconut sticky rice with ginger ice cream (dessert): This was a nice dessert to end the meal. The sticky rice was creamy and had a nice texture, it was not too sweet. The ginger ice cream had a mild flavour, I am not a big fan of ginger but I still enjoyed this ice cream.   The restaurant itself is very nice; it has a nice Thai décor with several Buddha statues and such kicking around. The restaurant is not too big and has an intimate ambiance. The service was excellent, our waiter was very attentive, gave us his recommendations and obliged our request to have all dishes cooked \"Thai spicy.\" You could tell he was very proud of the restaurant which made me feel better about taking his recommendation. I really enjoyed my experience at Mengrai and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good ambience however if you are looking for authentic Thai food, this is not the place for u."}
{"text":"Mengrai is always a great experience! Their food is top quality, creative and authentic."}
{"text":"This food was out of this world. The #54 curry doesn't disappoint, and great presentation.   The servers were incredibly polite, had great food suggestions and wine pairings, and I couldn't believe how quickly the food came out.   An amazing experience from top to bottom. If I had one complaint, it would be that the table we were assigned was too close to the host's station - it felt like any conversation was being eavesdropped on, even if that wasn't the intention.   In a city with so-so Thai - this is a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Came for company party. Outstanding experience. We ordered a variety and shared dishes. There are no wrong answers on the menu. Wonderful food."}
{"text":"The most beautiful Thai restaurant in Toronto. The decor is beautiful with warm wood and exposed brick.   The service is fantastic and everything comes beautifully plated and prepared. Everything is fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend the lychee curry, served in a coconut.  I've taken their cooking class and it's an excellent experience. You spend the afternoon cooking several dishes and then return to the dining room to enjoy your work with expertly paired wines."}
{"text":"I have had only two experiences here, and am offering a mediocre 3 star review, based on the food, and the decor, and staff.  The service is really great, which bumps this place up one star.  Staff are very attentive, and professional, which I really appreciate.  The food, however, less than great.  Now, I've yet to visit Khao San Road, however, I've been to Suko Thai on a number of occasions, and Mengrai Thai, you simply do not stack up.  Pad Thai was a bit bland, minus the chilies, as I like my Thai on the spicy side.  As well, the curry lacked a certain richness that I was hoping for.  And..  To add insult to all of this, there is a surcharge for a side of rice.  Seriously?  For rice?     Now, I could understand one side of this extra for rice business, seeing as the restaurant is a bit fancier, as compared most other Thai establishments, however, upon using the bathroom, the place really cheaper out in there.  A restaurant with proper napkins and table clothes, with dim lighting, proper staff, and pretty dishes should not stop at the bathroom door.  Like any real estate, the decor in the kitchen and the bathroom is what counts.  And, here, they fail. Mengrai, maybe you should set aside some of your rice surcharge money to step up your game.  And, maybe then, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The penang curry here is good; it is flavorful and creamy with the perfect amount of spice. However, their curries do not come with a side of rice.. we had to order a bowl of white rice for $2.50. It's a sneaky way to get customers to cough up a little extra without them realizing before ordering. With the rice, the penang curry came up to $16 before tax, which I think is a little pricey for curry.   The original Thai style pad Thai was a little underwhelming. There just wasn't a great deal of flavour in the dish and was fairly standard. I would've wanted to taste more of the tamarind.   The great thing about this place is that there are many vegan friendly options. All their curries are made with coconut milk and no cow's milk  (Yay!), and our waiter told us that most of the meat options can be substituted with tofu and veggies.   Overall, the atmosphere of the place was great. It's nice and quiet, so a great setting for a little dinner date. Price is a little steep, but the curry is flavorful.  I don't think I'm coming back any time soon unless I'm in the area and desperately craving Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautifully presented. For Muslims, they have a partial halal menu - ask your server about it."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and was not happy with the food at all. The soup was cold and chicken tasted so bad and not fresh. Pannange curry was just bland."}
{"text":"This review is more like a 3.5 for me. Mengrai came highly recommended by a friend of mine. It's a cute Thai restaurant located on Richmond just east of Sherbourne. If you happen to be walking here from the core, I would recommend coming east on King instead of Richmond as I find I don't feel the safest walking alone on Richmond East, especially when it's dark outside.   Ambience - 4/5. It was nice inside. I would describe it as cozy and there were some unique decor items. Overall, I was comfortable.  Appetizers (chicken satay, spring rolls, mango salad) - 3/5. I thought these were okay, nothing special. My dining companions enjoyed them more than I did, especially the spring rolls.  Original pad thai - 4/5. This was a solid pad thai. It was tasty, not too oily, and I would order it again.  Cashew chicken - 3/5. This was nice, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't order it again unless you have particular love for cashew chicken.  Elegant Curry with beef - 4/5 (according to my companions). My dining companions said this was the best part of the meal for them. I disagree only because the spice factor was too high for me (I have a low spice tolerance). I would give it a 3/5, but if you can handle spicier food, then I would recommend this dish.  Dessert - 4.5/5. My favourite part of the meal! I got the mango sticky rice with a side of coconut ice cream. The sticky rice was yummy, and the ice cream had some real pieces of coconut in it which was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this dessert. BF got the pineapple cheesecake which was good. I felt like it was a denser and heavier cheesecake than average, but it still tasted good. My friend really liked his coconut sticky rice.  Service - 5/5. Plates were cleared quickly, water was always topped up, and our server was attentive. The owner came by and made sure we were doing okay. The chef even came out at the end of our meal to be introduced. At the end of our meal, my dining companions each had an after dinner drink (a sherry and an americano), but I chose to stick with water. This seemed to prompt the owner to come by with a complimentary cup of tea (Youthberry white from Teavana) for me which was a nice gesture.  Overall, I would recommend checking out this place if you're looking to try a Thai restaurant that is different from your usual."}
{"text":"absolutely the best thai food restaurant i have been too....food is authentic.  Service is great."}
{"text":"Have ordered both take-out and delivery, and have been appeased after a number of terrible thai experiences in the area.   Pad thai was different, not bold in flavour but still good tasting and definitely no ketchup in this dish! The wife had the Cashew Chicken with successful results. The Green Curry Chicken was actually more spicy than flavourful which left us with mixed feelings, but this was redeemed by the Glass Noodles w/ Chicken which were probably my favourite - simple but effective with a soy and tamarind based sauce which were quite pleasing.  The restaurant itself is actually pretty nice as well, so while we did order take-out, I'm definitely curious about a future in house dining experience. This is definitely something to consider if you aren't looking for a dime a dozen thai experience either way."}
{"text":"We came here last sunday for a special Mother's Day dinner for my mother, obviously.   After trekking it on the 501 Streetcar/Bus combo, I got off at...Ontario Street? Thank gosh it was daytime is al I gotta say.   Anyways, I walked a block south to Richmond and there it was, Mengrai.  Inside it was awesome. There was a huge budda display that has some neat religious aspects to it. There also was like a elephant head-bust on the wall, which my niece was IN LOVE WITH. I'm pretty sure we convinced her tthat we were at the rainforest cafe.   We had:  Apps   Thai Mango Salad - I'm not actually a fan of mango in my food, but this was good. I'm sure mango afficianado's would say its amazing, but to me it was just okay.   Thai Spring Rolls - They were tiny, but good. Basic spring roll fare. Though, the sweet chili sauce that were served with it was PHENOMENAL. I'm not usually a fan of sweet chili, but it was SO GOOD.  Mains  Green Curry - Really good, but not spicy enough for me. Other people seemed to enjoy it too. It was gone first lol.  The Tenderloin with a pomegranate and balsamic reduction - So um, here's the thing. I really was looking forward to this, but we had to desecrate it and orrder it well done. Our fault. So when it arrived, the meat looked well done, but as we dug deeper in to the meat, the middle part of it was rare? Weird, but I like rare so I was happy to eat that part. Also, the meat had a very distinct burnt taste. My guess is that it was thrown onto the grill when it was waaaaaay too hot and didn't get enough time to cook all the way through. The pomegranate and balsamic reduction was delicious on the veggies underneath, but really really brought out the burnt flavours of the meat.   Bangkok Style Pad Thai - SO GOOD. ALL THAT CHICKEN AND ALL THAT SHRAMPZ.    Sides:   Jasmine & Coconut Rice - Good! Not burnt or anything.    Deserts:  Banana Fritters w Mango Ice Cream - SOOO GOOD. Loved the mango ice cream. I was too full though at this point so I just tasted the ice cream and a bite of the fritter. Still really good though. Mango Ice Cream tasted like it was made rather than bought, which is a huuuuuuuuge bonus.  Desert Trio - It was like 3 squares, one was a brownie, the other looked like a coconut date square and I don't know what the third was. I didn't try them though, but my niece was all about the brownie!   FINAL NOTES:  The service was excellent here. My water glass never reached below half point, seriously. It was constantly being refilled. The servers were super attentive and checked on us an appropriate amount of times. At one point, we had asked for sambal and likee half an hour later they still hadn't given it to us. But when we asked the waiter, he apologized profusely and said that it had slipped his mind. He looked genuine so it was no biggs, He was a nice guy in the end.   3.5 stars for now, but hopefully next time the beef isn't burnt."}
{"text":"If I lived downtown, this would probably be my go-to spot for Thai food. With awards going to the restaurant and to Head Chef Sasi, and celebrities dropping in for a delicious meal, it's no wonder that Mengrai Thai's food is top quality and authentic. My friend and I walked over to Mengrai Thai from the Christmas Market in the Distillery District, a 10-15-minute walk, on a weeknight and arrived around 8:30pm (closing time for Sun-Thur is 10pm; 11pm for Fri & Sat). We were seated quickly and it wasn't a busy night (we went on a Thursday). Service was quick and friendly though the server seemed tired and in a rush towards the end since it was the last hour before closing. The menu has a lot of options and looks busy but take your time with it (or ask the server for recommendations) and you'll be served a delicious meal no matter what you choose.   We ordered Sasi's Pad Thai ($15.00: shrimp paste, tiger shrimps, chicken, tofu, egg, garlic, tamarind, green onion, bean sprouts, and topped with crushed peanuts) - a seafood-based pad Thai that isn't as sweet as others but is very delicious. My friend and I enjoyed it a lot and agreed that it's one of the best we've ever had. We also ordered Sasi's Red Chicken curry with lychee ($18.50). It was served creatively in a freshly carved pineapple and had spices, pineapple and lychee bits, and kaffir lime leaves to flavour the dish. The curry is coconut-based so it's thicker and creamier than other curries from other cultures. We really enjoyed this one too - the lychees are a unique spin and addition to a curry dish. Steamed rice isn't included with the meals so you'll have to order it as a side ($2.50 for a bowl - it was enough for the both of us but if we didn't have the pad Thai and had ordered another entree that goes well with rice, we might have needed to order another side of steamed rice). If you pay in cash, you get a 15% discount!  If you're downtown and looking for great Thai food, you have to head over to Mengrai Thai. You won't be disappointed (and hey - maybe you'll spot someone famous though the chef and food are famous enough)!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places in the city. The food is delicious. Although I am a green curry Person, the red curry here is one of the best I have ever had.   Great ambience, chef Sasi's delicious food and very friendly staff make this place a fantastic fantastic place."}
{"text":"Mengrai Thai must be one of the most (if not THE most) famous Thai restaurant in Toronto. I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.  With such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.  Their menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:  - Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it. - Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend. - Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked.  - Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.  Overall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef. However, our actual experience with the food here dulled in comparison to the glowing expectations of celebrity chef resto."}
{"text":"Great food and staff. I ate with a group of friends, and we loved the lychee curry chicken. We also ordered the yam taro rolls, chinese broccoli, original chicken pad thai, and steamed vegetables. Everything else ranged from OK to good. The owner/manager and his staff were also really friendly and welcoming. One of the servers spoke Cantonese and Mandarin with us when he recognized us as Chinese, and one of the other servers explained to us how to make the lychee curry."}
{"text":"Mengrai was a great experience. We ordered from their preset vegetarian menu and my boyfriend and I were both pleased. The presentation was beautiful and portions were perfect size for sharing. It was my first time ordering the morning glory deep fried vegetables..... this is a must try!"}
{"text":"We continue our exploration of downtown dining and yesterday was my partners pick. His choice was Mengrai Thai the best so far, so my partner also gets five stars!  It's just a short walk from where we live, I had passed it many times but never took notice. It's funny how things work out, we are taking a trip to Thailand and got a good deal more than delicious food.   I love the entrance. Last night, cold and dark as we approached the door  I felt like I was going into an obscure trendy diner and stepped into another world. Going through the curtains up the steps into a cozy feeling space even though it was a fair size. I say trendy but unlike other trendy restaraunts the prices were reasonable.   We ordered a bottle of wine, and started with the appetizer platter. Then I had the shrimp stir fry and my partner had Penang chicken curry, we ended up sharing and ordered the banana fritters with coconut ice cream for dessert the food was great!  Unlike other Thai restaraunts I didn't feel rushed.   Alan the chap,who runs the place is a seasoned traveler to Thailand and was a great resource. He shared some of his tales and a great many pictures of his trips, it felt like spending time with a long lost friend. THe chef also came to,our table and she was an inspiration. My reservations of traveling so far have turned into anticipation of a three week vacation  My only regret is that our quest is to try new places though I feel like this place might be an exception."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch here last week. Very cool location kind of tucked away from downtown.  Not greasy at all, no heavy feeling after eating here. I like that. Too often in Toronto, our Asian and Asian-inspired cuisine is just oily and gross. This is one of those rare diamonds in the rough where you can experience accessible but authentic cuisine without breaking the bank.  Our table of three ordered the following (with descriptions from the menu):  1. Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee - artfully served in a fresh carved pineapple - The best curry dish! A highly seductive blend of spice & flavours with fresh pineapple, imbued w/kaffir lime leaf. The result is so harmonious, perfect in everyway. Chef Sasi received worldwide attribution from bon vivants & food writers ever since she created this dish in 1997... Find out why every referred customer asks for \"the #54 dish\".  2. House Pad Thai - Sweet red saucy version Pad Thai that half of Toronto's foodies love (the chicken version).  3. ME! I ordered V1 - Vegetarian Delight - Asian field greens, soy, garlic, onion, tofu.  The dishes were $18.50, $11 and $11, respectively. Amazing prices for the portions AND the quality!  All three presentations were gorgeous. Service was amazingly fast and attentive - you can tell they are used to the tight business lunch timeline. It was easy to talk shop across the table - didn't have to strain our voices at all. It seemed like most of the other diners were there with similar company.  Chef Sasi won Harbourfront Centre's Iron Chef competition this past summer. I work there, so I saw her passion first-hand. It was awe-inspiring."}
{"text":"I was lured in by the hype: celebrity endorsements, Zagat 2014, top 100 restaurants 2012/2013/2014, kitchen manned by a former Iron Chef winner.   OUR ORDER: \"2 course\" Prix Fixe Lunch ($5 extra if you want to share)         1st course - 2 tiny deep fried Spring rolls that were crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside, 1 segment (see pics) of a fresh Spring roll that was bland, and a bland mango salad. Mango wasn't fully ripe so it was neither sweet nor sour.          2nd course - Green Curry Chicken with rice. The taste of the bamboo shoots overshadowed everything.  Chicken Pad Thai (Tamarind base) - chicken was tender but dish was very bland and missing the crushed peanuts. Had to ask for extra lime and chili pepper flakes to try and jazz it up a bit.  Thai iced tea - very creamy but weak tea flavor.  The restaurant is very cozy with beautiful artwork but the view from the front windows are of someone's house and a parking lot, better to sit further inside the restaurant. Also even though the lights are dimmed, it's noisy even when it's not even packed. Our server was polite, very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive.   All I want is some good ole authentic Thai food: nothing fancy or fusion, just complex flavors that are well balanced. Oh well, the search continues....."}
{"text":"Finally! Toronto gets some great Thai. The kitchen is immaculate, waiters attentive, owners welcoming, and the food authentic. Curries, Pad Thai, all excellent and prepared with the finest ingredients."}
{"text":"Let me be totally clear: this one star review is not a reflection on the service or the ambiance of the restaurant, which were both top-notch.  My friend had organized a group dinner here on Saturday night and there were a number of things that resulted in this review.  This had absolutely nothing to do with our server, who was super attentive and extremely considerate.  This had *everything* to do with the food.  You see, I made the mistake of having eaten at Sabai Sabai and Khao San Road earlier this week.  These are the only two Thai restaurants in Toronto.  They happen to blow this place out of the water.  As a result, the food here was really, really, unbearable.  There was simply no making up for the great service, the friendly waiters, and the soothing ambiance.  I will not come back here despite the hype and the photo of Jessica Alba at the front.  I don't care how many celebs eat here, the best Thai food in the city is to be found at Sabai Sabai and Khao San Road.  You have my two cents."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  Maybe the best in Toronto?  It is a bit off the beaten path, but worth it once you get there.  The ambience is nicer than most Thai restaurants in Toronto - an old industrial building with exposed brick and high ceilings.  Have been several times, with friends and with my husband for a romantic dinner.  Perfect for both occasions."}
{"text":"To avoid all the turkey dinners over Christmas (which I totally would not mind!), our families decided to have our christmas gathering at a Thai restaurant. Searching for a place that would not be too loud, have good food, and a mandatory - A ROUND TABLE for good conversation, I decided to book Mengrai because if good reviews, a unique menu, in addition to your traditional ones, and good location for everyone to get to.  When making my reservation, the staff was very generous to give me the round table (that I've seen from the photos), and prior to the evening, they called to let me know that I would only be allowed for a 2 hours seating due to another party. It was totally understandable and courteous for the heads up.  There are 6 free parking spots outside their restaurant and we were lucky enough to park in the last one. At 6 - the place had a few tables filled, but the emptiness did not last long. Between seven people, we pretty much ordered a wide selection of dishes -  1. street style pad thai which had a bit of sweetness, although I felt there wasn't as much shrimp as I had expected. the flavours were bold and delicious, and the noodles were not soggy, giving it good textures with all the different ingredients  2. Their special mengrai SASI pad thai - the restaurant's own pad thai - this is not sweet at all, so that's a whole different set of flavours. I have to say that because it wasn't sweet, it was not my favourite, although very very good. It was extremely saucy (which I like), and there were flavours of dried preserved shrimp which was very potent but added to the overall taste and texture. Between the whole table, most preferred this over the traditional sweeter pad thai.  3. Pineapple fried rice with beef. There was definitely a lot of beef and pineapple, served in the half shell, but I thought it was a little too oily. Maybe thai fried rice is made this way, or it could have been the beef. Still good, but could have lightened on the oil.  4 - 6: THREE CURRIES - their specialty included chicken and lychee, and two additional - one with lamb, and one with shrimp....... I cannot remember all the details of it, but I do remember that I could taste the difference in them all. The sauces all had a different character, whether, sweet, mild, or spicy. I especially like the one with the lychee because it had large pieces of fruit that added a nice sweetness to the whole dish.  All the dishes were eaten completely, not complaints and everyone agreed that it was delicious. At around 8m, the waitress politely told me that the next party would be arriving shortly so we finished our dessert (ice cream that was nothing out of the ordinary) and happily left with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"The best Thai Restaurant in Toronto, and high chance in Eastern Canada.  I've been to them all in Toronto and nothing quite matches up to Mengrai.  Why?  Doesn't matter if you come in a big group or come for a dinner date, the experience is exquisite. Great menu, well priced, and a good drink menu(which most Thai Places don't)  Also celebrities comes here often such as Jessica Alba, Denzel Washtinon etc. If Celebrities with fantastic taste experiences are coming here, why aren't you?"}
{"text":"Went here for a corporate function...our Divisional President was a regular here, and boy did we get treated like royalty.  I had the Sasi golden flowers, Mango salad, dumplings, crispy king prawns, pad thai, sticy rice, morning glory, pumpkin soup, chicken satay, and some type of crispy beef...  It was absolute heaven."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is amazing, the ambiance is great, and the owner is super friendly. It has consistently proven to be a good place."}
{"text":"Every time someone mentions Thai food my mind instantly think of the amazing Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee! Best Thai food in town!"}
{"text":"How have I not written about this place yet? This is the best Thai restaurant in the city, as far as I can tell. The food is phenomenal, the restaurant is gorgeous, and the wait staff are friendly and helpful. They make Pad Thai that doesn't taste like ketchup. This really shouldn't be something that sets a Thai restaurant apart from the rest, but in Toronto it seems to be. (Seriously, Toronto Thai places, you need to stop with that already.) You can get a pumpkin soup that is served in a pumpkin. Fish that is all kinds of awesome. I love this place, and would go all th time if it wasn't out in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Don't allow reservations for large groups unless you can handle it.  We arrived on time.  Half of our party was seated and we had to sit somewhere else b/c they still had people eating at the rest of our table.  No one came over to give us water, a drink, anything.  When they finally put us together, half an hour late, it took another 15 minutes to get water and let them know what we PRE ordered to eat.  An hour in and I still hadn't even received my glass of wine let alone any food.    When the food finally came it was okay.  Not great, and certainly not worth the wait.  I liked how the appetizer came with 4 little bites.  The mango salad was very spicy, I couldn't eat it.  I wish I had known b/c I would have asked for no chilli.  The summer roll was good, as was the dumpling.  For my main I had the striped bass.  It was okay, a bit over cooked and didn't have enough vegetables.  I tried a bit of my boyfriend's pad thai and couldn't believe how bland it was.  I can't believe they called this place \"Gourmet\".  Just b/c you put something on a fancy plate or serve a dish out of a pineapple does not make it gourmet.  I had another engagement I had to be at and thought 3 hours would have been enough time for us since it was a big party but I should have blocked off 6 it seems like.  I left after 3 hours and people were still finishing their mains so I missed dessert.  I think it's safe to say I will never go back there again.    The only thing good I can say is that thank god they split our bills!"}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends for dinner and we all commented about how the restaurant is situated in an area that's a bit tricky to get to (also slightly sketchy).  That aside, we were a party of six where majority ended up getting the curry dishes.  We were slightly taken aback by the somewhat steep prices for rice ($2.50, $3.00) for a small bowl of rice.  I ended up getting the green curry with chicken and it was pretty spicy (did not make any modifications) to the point where I was sweating; one of my friends needed more chilli flakes in hers, so your taste buds may vary. :P  The curry was a bit too creamy for my tastes (other friends also agreed), but overall the food is decent but priced a bit on the steeper side."}
{"text":"My first time doing reservations on Yelp. So easy! I reserved 2 hours before the seating and they had the reservation when we got there!   Very pretty place. Loved all the Thailand decor!  The menu is extensive, but a bit confusing. It had the chef recommended stuff on the first page and then each page had different appetizers and mains. I missed other appetizers and thought there was only one page of appetizers. I think the waiter should explain how the menu is laid out when we first get it. It's good they organized the popular choices first, but a heads up would be good. We almost missed ordering an appetizer cause we missed a page. I only remembered cause some appetizers were recommended by Yelp.   We ordered:  Fried morning glory: Yelp recommended. Deep fried spinach and Chinese veggie. Really good! A  Lychee and chicken curry: one of their famous dishes. We ordered mild spicy and it was still too spicy for me. Recommend no spice for all my non spicy peeps! Lychee added a nice sweetness! Really liked this dish. We ordered coconut rice with it. Liked it a lot! A  Sasi pad Thai: I was weary about ordering this cause it warned that it had a shrimp taste with no sweetness. I like my pad Thai sweet with Tamarind sauce, but it was really good. It did have a bit of sweetness, but the shrimp paste added a nice savoury taste. I really liked this dish. A   Thai ice tea: exactly like khao San road. Liked it! A  We were stuffed and even had leftovers. Portions are good size. Price is a bit more expensive than other places. I believe either same or a bit more expensive than khao San road or pai.  I like this place because it's unlike khao San road or pai, where it adds a twist to the ingredients used. Presentation of food is good too! I loved that they put the curry in a pineapple and the peanuts in a bowl separate from the pad Thai so we can decide how much we want.  Come here if you want an \"authentic\" Thai experience!"}
{"text":"Found this with the help of the Yelp community and it lived up to the raves.  Service is outstanding, you can tell that comes from the owner who makes an appearance at every table to affably confirm his guests are enjoying the experience.  Ingredients fresh, the menu has many options without being being as dense as Green Mango.  Try the Red Snapper, chunked cubes of meat, flash fried and served reconstructed in the fish carcass with a curry sauce on the side.  The Fried Morning Glory (Thai spinach) is an excellent appetizer.  Central location (Corktown) made for a nice alternative to the crowded Thai spots in the centre of the city.  Only 5 minutes away from Yonge and Queen.  Cooking classes available in an attached studio.  Need to check that out..."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, Gabrielle was very professional and kind over the phone. My parents and I and were very excited to try the food because the decor was the nice and the restaurant looked clean. We wanted to branch out from our usual Suko Thai routine and was excited to find another Thai food nearby.   Salad roll was probably the worst. Spring mix just doesn't taste good in a salad roll and the ratio of spring mix to the \"main show\" which were mango, cucumber and carrot was 95-5. Nothing interesting, worst salad roll that all 3 of us have ever had.  Green curry was mediocre at best. Sasi pad thai was probably the best out of the 3 entrees but still doesn't compare to pad thai in other restaurants. Spicy thai thick noodle was confusing, lacked flavor and not very Thai.  My favorite was the mango sticky rice. Consistency was good and wasn't too sweet. However, it had so little mango and they were diced in small cubes.  Sadly we wont be returning to this establishment due to taste."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE Thai food and have been to most Thai restaurants in Toronto. Unfortunately, this place does not top the list. I have been here twice: once to try and again to give it another try. I visited a second time to confirm the doubts I had after visiting it the firs timet. That is, it's just not all that great.  The setting is nice and a little more upscale than you would find at other Thai restaurants, but you have to decide if that is the most important thing for you. If it's not, I suggest you wait in line at Khao San Road or \"rough it\" and visit its sister restaurant Sukho Thai, which is slightly less elegant. And if you are okay with a straight-up hole-in-the-wall with matching prices, try Thai Country Kitchen in Chinatown."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I took a cooking lesson from Allan and his son Brandon, and loved it.  Allan shared some personal stories with us about his restaurant and Brandon taught us about cooking Thai cuisine.  After a lesson on the main ingredients used in Thai dishes, we went into the kitchen and made Tom Yum soup, green curry, red curry, and two types of pad thai that were absolutely delicious.  Not to mention the service was great.   We can't wait to go back.  Thanks again Allan and Brandon."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars.  Service: 2 stars.  Sorta vegan friendly.  The menu lists dozens of vegetarian options, has symbols for which items can be made gluten-free, has warnings about which ones contain nuts, but doesn't go that one extra step to list which are/can be made vegan -- so vegans will need to negotiate with the waiter/kitchen.  Service wasn't as good as it should have been.  Half the table -- the non-vegans -- ordered the fixed price 4 course dinner (which actually totaled about 12 dishes, split amongst 4 plates).  The vegans ordered individual dishes to share.  Unfortunately, all the vegan dishes were brought out at once during the fixed-price course #3.  So for 3/4 of the meal, 1/2 the table had to sit there and watch the other 1/2 eat.  Additionally, the servers weren't very good at keeping the water glasses filled and refused to leave a pitcher at the table when asked.  Maybe 2 stars for service is being generous.  The vegan dishes were just OK.  Nothing to complain about, but also nothing special to note -- which was disappointing as the chef was supposed to be the best Thai chef in all of Canada and claimed to use the best/freshest ingredients.  So, 3 stars for the food.  The atmosphere was good, giving then an extra 1/2 star, so 3 stars total."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience for a group of first timers in Toronto AND  trying Thai food for the first time! I picked this place out based off of its reviews and availability on Christmas weekend. The service was amazing! They were very helpful and attentive! The owner even came and introduced himself and the chef since he knew we were from out of town. We ordered the pineapple fried rice, the glass noodles, the pomegranate beef tenderloin, the pad Thai, the Sai Thai, and for appetizers we got the tempura spinach (was everyone's favorite!) and the spring rolls. I highly recommend the tenderloin and the fried rice! The pad Thai was a bit underwhelming and needed some more veggies but everything else really made up for it! The rest of my party that was having Thai food for the first time was satisfied and pleased, so my mission was complete! :)"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner on July 17th. at this charming restaurant. I am used to great Thai food in New York and Mengrai is at the top of my ratings. More than just very good food at fair prices, the staff was really charming and helpful. It can be busy so it' best to reserve on weekends. The owners are right there and the whole place is squeaky clean. I say go there and enjoy ! Alan"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in a lovely restaurant.    I went here for dinner this fall, after hearing recommendations for it for about a year.  First off, the only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5, is because there is another Thai restaurant that I think has tastier food for a less expensive price.  I ordered their prix fixe option, which included an appetizer platter, a second course, a main, and dessert.  The appetizer platter had some mango salad, the taro yam roll, the shrimp triangle wrapper, and the crisp dumpling; these provided a really nice mix of tastes to start my meal.  I had the divine crispy morning glory paired with golden pumpkin soup, which really reinforced that this place has fantastic food, as I'm not usually a fan of soup, but I finished this soup wanting more.  For my main course, I had \"Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry\" - their most famous and most recommended dish.  And it did live up to the recommendation; it was a very flavourful curry with the pleasant surprise of pineapple!  Finally, for dessert I had the ginger ice cream, which was also surprisingly tasty.   The service was also excellent, with our server providing excellent opinions when I had difficulty deciding what to order.  Also, I went there with a vegetarian friend who also had an excellent meal with no complaints.  Overall, an excellent meal and definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I always recommend this place. The food is fantastic. Great place to eat, and very comfortable atmosphere. The best seats for a group is the booth in the back of the upstairs dining level.  The Royal lemongrass coconut soup is fantastic, a highlight on the first page of the menu. Be prepared, for soup it's priced really high. I'm glad I ordered it, that soup was amazing! It's made for sharing, so it makes a nice appetizer, and a great way to kick off a good meal.  Three types of pad thai to choose from. Street style is good, but I prefer the saucier ones."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food every time I have been.  The pumpkin soup is absolutely delicious and highly recommended. Ordered the Pad Thai which was a little different than the usual Pad Thai (a bit more tomatoey - if that makes sense) but good nonetheless.   Service was a bit poor at first but got better as the meal progressed."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian spring rolls as an app - nothing special, they may have been frozen spring rolls.   The #54 red curry, original pad Thai, and green curry were all very bland and flavourless.   The mango cheesecake was decent, I would eat that again.   The service was hit or miss - they gave us two cheesecakes on the house due to birthdays, however they forgot a cappuccino one of us ordered.  I would not recommend nor would I come back. Pai or Khao San Road are a much better bet."}
{"text":"This food is really amazing. I ordered delivery and, not only were the two guys I talked to really lovely, but it arrived earlier than they thought it would.  We had the chinese broccoli and mushroom (delicous!), the cashew beef and the sticky rice. Go for the sticky rice. It's incredible.   They also have fantastic spring rolls- I loved how small and devoid of filler they were and how fresh everything was!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service! We got there for our 6pm reservation and a kind server greeted us and escorted us to a table at the very back of the restaurant (even though the restaurant was near empty). We looked passed it and had a seat and that was it. Never again we were we met by a server. 20 minutes later I got up to go speak to a server who rudely brushed me off saying \"someone will be with you\". I was offended by her dismissive nature and asked to speak to a manager. She said \"he's busy and will come to your table.\" I sat down and waited for another 5-10 minutes and the manager showed up holding someone else's order. He asked \"what's the problem?\" Which I shared with him. He said, \"Hollywood actors come here and wait because the food is so good, why do you have a problem?\" I was absolutely blown away by the rudeness and lack of customer service. Didn't even get to try the food but would never come back based on that horrible service!"}
{"text":"Average Thai food. Definitely not worthy of a visit by samuel L Jackson, or at least that's what the management claims. Hope you are a fan of the ketchup if you order the pad Thai."}
{"text":"2.5*. The food here was a total hit or miss for us, and the service was definitely lacking the evening we visited. Overall, a pretty average experience and doesn't come close to the quality of other Thai restaurants in the area that we've tried   First, we visited on a weekday evening in early September 2016, around 7:30 PM, and it wasn't too busy. Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes for someone to come over and even bring us menus, another 15 minutes for water to be brought over, and another 20 minutes to even take our order (the couple beside us waited almost 30 minutes to even pay their bill). Service was pretty slow the evening we were there, despite having several staff members on the floor (who kept disappearing), and the restaurant not being too busy.  Second, the food. We loved the Morning Glory Fritters, but the rest of the food was pretty blah. The Green Curry tasted way too milky and completely bland, and the pad thai tasted extremely basic - no kick, and barely any flavour. So while the appetizer was great, the main meal was a disappointment. Plus, for what the food was, we felt that the price didn't reflect the quality of the dishes for the most part.  We wouldn't go out of our way to come back here again."}
{"text":"wow, what an amazing thai restaurant. the food was flavourful, excellent quality and huge selection. this is the best thai i have ever had.  the service was exceptional. the waiter knew every detail of the menu. from ingredients, methods of cooking to anticipated flavours, this guy knew his business.  the restaurant appearance was really impressive too. it was interesting just to walk through the restaurant and see the other rooms.  this restaurant is not unbelievably expensive. for the quality of food and service, this restaurant is worth every penny. i'm looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The service was ok - a bit slow and they kind of ignored me but it was a busy Saturday night and I was alone. Oh, and they also forgot my drink until I was mostly done with dinner. However, I will say their food is soooo good. I went with Chef Sasi's pad Thai which was out of this world and the veggie spring rolls. My drink was also delicious, though it was pretty late. Great food. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We've been visiting Mengrai Thai for years and just had another exceptional meal. The food is superb, as is the friendly service. The space is elegant and intimate while remaining intimate and friendly. Our favourite Thai food in Toronto! Great for vegetarians and folks who require gluten free. Favourites : Green Thai Curry, Royal Coconut Soup (served in a coconut), Crispy Tofu ..."}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout here, and it was a fairly large order (around 8 items). The waiter who assisted me was very helpful and courteous, and I was treated the same when I went to the place to pick it up. The restaurant itself is a nice setting, though I don't quite understand the idea behind the curtains when you first walk in. The food was ready for me shortly after I arrived.  The noodle dishes were quite good (e.g. pad thai, pad sew), but the highlight of the meal was easily the red curry. It was unique and one of the best curries I've ever tasted from a Thai restaurant. The stir fried dishes were mediocre and honestly all felt like they were the same thing. I would not bother with that again.  Portion sizes border slightly on the generous side, but each order is generally intended for one person (i.e. trying family-style with a larger group here could be a touch difficult). Prices are more or less in line with the competition in downtown Toronto.  I am not sure if this place is authentically Thai, as the owner I'm pretty sure Malaysian. I could be mistaken however, or the chef could always be Thai, who knows. Just thought I'd point this out for the authenticity police out there.  They did mess up my order slightly by missing one dish, but they quickly rectified that by calling me and having it delivered to me and offering me a complimentary rice for the inconvenience. I'm quite satisfied with their service."}
{"text":"Review on take out via Doordash.  I think this was the one of the best Thai food meals I've had! They really understand vegan requests and honoured my request for no egg, no fish sauce. Everything was really tasty!  We ordered:  - vegetarian spring rolls - vegetarian cold rolls - vegetable fried rice - house special red curry with tofu, pineapple & lychees - classic vegetarian pad thai - steamed and sticky rice with peanut sauce  This is actually a 4.5 star review. It would be a 5 star review except for two things: the cold rolls had a lot of lettuce and not enough other stuff, and the curry, while super tasty, had no vegetables and was a bit pricier than the regular red curry. I know lots of curries are just protein, but I was really missing some other texture and freshness in this.   Having said that, I'd still order it all again!"}
{"text":"I found the food here amazing! Thanks to my fellow yelpers, I most likely ordered the best items off the menu. Even the owner passed by and made a comment about our order. We ordered the following dishes (for two) and it was enough portions for our appetite:  - Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee - Grilled Beef Tenderloin with Pomegranate Tamarind - Golden Pumpkin Soup  All the above items are a 'must try' in opinion.. Super delicious! The only dilemma I'll have when I return is whether or not to order the above items or try something else on the menu..."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service - the waiter was especially friendly, treating us to a complimentary green tea at the end. They have 6 parking spots in front of the restaurant but unfortunately they were all taken.  We had the appetizer platter, which consisted of 2 pieces each of: vegetarian cold roll, veg spring roll, shrimp triangles, coconut shrimp and some other deep fried shrimp thing i couldn't remember. The veg cold rolls and spring rolls were pretty standard, neither great nor bad. The best one I enjoyed was the shrimp triangles, which were surprisingly sweet.  We then had the red curry with lychees and sasi pad thai for our main. I really enjoyed the red curry - I liked the sweetness given by the lychees and pineapple, balanced out by a medium spiciness. It was nicely presented in a pineapple. The pad thai was more saucy, but overall it tasted a bit oily to me and the flavour didn't really stand out.  Overall, I think it's a good dine-in choice for Thai food, and the food was above average, though I think i prefer sukhothai and khao san road on purely the food, but the ambience here is quieter and better for a nice leisurely meal. The service gave the extra star. Our water glass was never empty and the servers were very attentive, though it was a quieter Tuesday night that we went. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooooooo Good !!! is like a dream in a dish!!! Amazing for dating!, food is really delicious. price is decent!! I would recommended to everyone .. Hands down is the best!"}
{"text":"5-stars for this place because the service is damn good and they make you feel like you're part of their family.  I'm starting to feel like I may be related to them after eating there just twice.  First time, I called in and I got the restaurant owner, Allan.  He was really nice, and boasted about the restaurant - he seemed genuinely proud.  He told me his wife is the cook and has been asked to cook for celebrities.  He said that I could park over at the car garage, Watson's next door.  The food is good, it definitely is.  My tip though is to ask the waiter for recommendations, because the menu is a bit confusing.  I liked the deep fried morning glory and their red and green curries.  Skip the curry if you're not into coconut-based curries though.  It really hit the spot for me since I was craving curry for weeks after eating at Mengrai.    The second time I came to Mengrai, I had a similar experience and the restaurant was about to close when I started hearing whispers that Samuel L Jackson was dining there!  OMGWTFBBQ!  Samuel L F-ing Jackson!  So of course I tried to take a peek at him.  Turns out Allan and his stories about celebrities dining there was true!  The night was coming to an end and my friend and I wanted to meet Samuel L Jackson.  The restaurant is now closing up and the family is taking photos with Samuel, and Allan comes around and offers us a photo with his family and Samuel L Jackson!  He even took it with my cellphone and made sure there was enough lighting.  That was the nicest thing a restaurant owner has done for me as a dining guest.  It really was completely above and beyond.  He was so concerned about the photo turning out nice for us too.  I am just at awe.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"It really disappoints me to give this place a 3/5. I've been hearing rave reviews from Yelpers and friends about Mengrai for over a year since I moved into the neighbourhood. I had a huge craving for Thai food one evening so I decided to get take out.   Called and spoke to a very friendly man on the phone. I mentioned it was my first time ordering and trying their food so he gave me quite a bit of information, recommendations etc. I decided to go with their small appetizer platter (6pc), their special red curry with chicken, lychee and pineapple, #54 house pad Thai with the shrimp paste, side order of coconut rice and mango sticky rice.   First thing - I am usually so weary of ordering take out because the degree of deliciousness usually goes down once you take it home but it's usually good enough. My friend and I ate the apps. They were okay. I had nothing to report there. Then we tried pad Thai. It was good, I thought it was slightly dry tasting - maybe that is the style of the pad Thai since their menu did mention it was different. We thought this was good and maybe if eaten at the restaurant it would be better. We then tried the red curry with coconut rice. I asked for no spice at all and I found it was missing something for me. Duh - maybe the spice? I didn't want to not enjoy my food so I did ask for mild. My friend absolutely LOVED it. He loved the lychee, and the taste of the curry with the coconut rice. Mango sticky rice was also very good with little pieces of mango in it. Great texture and delicious tasting.   You'd think at least I'd give Mengrai a better review. But, while I was eating the curry, I happen to eat something funny and hard. When I took it out of my mouth it was a piece of one of those silver pieces from a scrubbing pad (used the wash dishes). I've done that at home myself, but it was disappointing to order an expensive meal, and get that with the dish. Although I lived close by, my friend told me to just let it go and not call them about it. Still - I was kind of freaked that I almost swallowed it but somehow was able to spit it out. *Phew*  Will I come back again? Maybe not for awhile. Based on the other Yelp reviews and pictures, I do want to give this place another shot but not anytime soon :("}
{"text":"The Thai food here is definitely one of the best I've had in the city, and the service was terrific. The restaurant itself is quite intimate and rustic.  We started with the golden flower appetizer, that was reminiscent of a very light vegetable tempura, with a sweet chili Thai sauce. Delicious. For our mains we had pad Thai, chefs red chicken curry, and the bass. All of them were very tasty. Perfect level of spiciness.  All in all a great Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best thai I have had anywhere  and I have been everywhere.From Midland to Victoria.Anazing!"}
{"text":"Mengrai Thai is a typical non-offensive Thai restaurant They have the Thai offerings that you would expect to see, such as Pad Thai and Curries, and they do them justice. But there are just too many high quality Thai restaurants now in the city thanks to the Khao San Road/Sukho Thai people that it's hard to stand out.  I opted to get the Red Curry Chicken Lunch special, because they are known for their Red Curry Chicken Lychee. It tasted good, and had a good amount of heat to it. Just nothing I haven't had before, and it didn't taste as bright and fresh as some Thai places I've been to now. If I had never had Thai food before I would have been blown away.  I would eat here again if it was convenient, but as of right now I won't be rushing back. A solid lunch option in the area."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is mainly because I'm trying to be strict with my stars and I've only been here once.... I went with a friend on a Sunday night at around 7pm.  The restaurant is hidden away on Ontario St near Queen and Sherbourne where you wouldn't necessarily expect to find a really good restaurant (I think Popeye's fried chicken is the next closest).  We were greeted warmly and shown to our table.  It was nice and private, although it seemed a bit strange that they left the curtains to the office area open right next to us.  But that's nitpicking. The menu is full of things that sound tasty so I annoyed my friend by trying to get him to tell me what I wanted.  He's a regular, but couldn't really help because he's enjoyed pretty much everything he's eaten there.   Our server was lovely and was very patient when she had to go away and come back because I was deciding for so long (my tendency to start chatting too much when I'm handed a menu doesn't help).  In the end I settled on green curry chicken with coconut rice and he had the pad thai with chicken and shrimp.  The dishes were served in lovely silver bowls which helped to make it seem special. Prices are reasonable and the mains we had were just the right size.  They have a wine menu and a few desserts but we stuck with the one course.  The lovely staff allowed us to linger over it and we never felt rushed. As for the food?  All I managed to say as we left was \"num num!\".  It was really delicious.  I was utterly content as I ate my curry and think I kept a little happy tummy smile on my face for a few hours after.  I need to go back to try the rest of the menu.  This place could be looking at 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, not sure if it's worth the premium pricing. But am I the only one who experienced the marketing of the owner's charity school in Thailand? As soon as our dinner plate was taken away, the server asked us if we ever wanted to go to Thailand. Despite in the middle of our private conversation, my friend and I politely said yes and resumed talking. The server then called the owner over who brought his own chair, sat down at a very uncomfortable distance to me and started his 10 minutes marketing speech while my friend and I were still in the middle of our conversation. He took out his phone and started showing us pictures of his adult sons and pictures of young women who he said have visited and volunteered at the school -- in his original words \"This one is a model from the UK\", \"This one was only 17 years old but volunteered there for two weeks with no problem\". I thought these comments were quite irrelevant and almost inappropriate. Right before we were leaving the restaurant, the server asked us \"where do you live\"...Maybe I'm narrow-minded, but I found both of them quite creepy and would not go back for the over priced food either."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional -- I had the pumpkin soup, the satay and mango salad starter, the pad thai, and the #54 red curry, and they were the best Thai dishes I've had in Toronto. I'd give the place 5 stars if they updated their decor and exterior -- the outside canopies aren't inviting and it's hard to tell if Mengrai is a restaurant or a catering place; the inside dining spaces are a little haphazard and the lighting a bit too bright. Nevertheless, I'll still be returning for the food!"}
{"text":"The two of us decided to try this place after seeing all the reviews.  It is very close to our home so we were really hoping that this can become our go-to Thai resto.   Unfortunately, it was only okay.  All the food was tasty but nothing to write home about.  I think most of it was good because it was piping hot at the time.... The leftover pad Thai tasted bland and left much to be desired the next day when I packed it for lunch.  My biggest problem with the place is the price.  It's very expensive for the quality of food that they are serving.  I know I shouldn't compare it to the food that I had when I was in Thailand but at least what I had there was fresh and yummy.  Like the other Yelper said, some of the dishes had a previously frozen quality to it... And you're charging how much? Service was good though, to be fair. Our search for good Thai food in the city continues...."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday evening ~  I didn't need to make a reservation.  INTERIOR: I was stunned, it's cozy and cute! It's quite dim in there, but I do like the atmosphere.  SERVICE: The service is EXCELLENT. Phenomenal, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. Everyone is well-mannered, polite, and the service is fast.  FOOD: We ordered.. Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee (I loved the curry, but wasn't used to eating lychees with curry). Original Thai Style Pad Thai Noodles (Best Pad Thai I've ever had--better than the one at Pai Northern Thai). Highly recommend this! Thai Sweet Coconut Sticky Rice w/ Fresh Mango (I would not recommend because it had to much coconut milk so it turned out slightly watery and not a lot of mangos were in it).  Overall, I approve! We had a lovely experience and I will def be coming back before I move to SF :)"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto we received an invitation to visit this Thai restaurant that was family owned and operated.  The folks there come from Thailand and thought it would be a good experience.  The bad first: The place is nice but sitting in the back got to be pretty warm after awhile.  It was summer time but as you eat some spicy food and sit there, just gets really warm and a bit uncomfortable.  They had a fan going but might want to consider investing in an AC unit for next summer.  The good: We were taken on a food journey through Thailand and it was amazing.  The first few dishes came out as individual plates and the portions were good for that.  Then as we got towards the middle to end, the dishes were family style.  The flavors were a tad spicy which is good, I like do like spicy from any range unless I simply can't taste it then that is too much but none of that was here.  The flavors and the journey the restaurant owner took us on was simply great.  If you are from out of town and want an experience, check it out and the staff there is amazing and want nothing more but for you to enjoy!  Favorite dish:  I think the loved the dessert, the not-too-sweet mango with rice.  Go out and EAT!"}
{"text":"The best and most authentic Thai food in Toronto.  Great service and atmosphere, but most importantly, the food is excellent.  How many other Toronto Thai restaurants have several different styles of Pad Thai?  None that I can name.  The prices are a bit higher than normal but it's always been worth it for my money.  This is Toronto's hidden Thai gem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I am very disappointed about the level of service we got from this place. The food is ok but the service is sub par. As expected we got to the restaurant on time due to our reservation. We were greeted with a very nice waiter. However, as soon as we got to our table it was right beside the entrance that we felt we didn't have enough privacy (mind you this was 6:30 pm and the place was half empty until we left the restaurant) I then requested to be moved and spoke to a different attendant and this is when it all went down hill. He wasn't pleasant at all and pretended that he couldn't understand any word I said. Instead of addressing our concerns, he even made a rebuttal that it was the best table in the restaurant. In my head it could be if there's going to be fire in restaurant. But overall I won't be coming back. I'm so disappointed that I had to choose this restaurant for my birthday. There's a lot of Thai places in the city and some don't offer great food but you always come back due to the service you are getting. However, this is not the case.  Also I forgot to mention, we ordered 3 entrees (red curry with lychee) and expected a cup of rice for each of us as mentioned on the menu. The rude waiter only gave us 2 and when asked why he said \"I think that will be enough for you ladies\".  People you have been warned."}
{"text":"I have to say, for the price you're paying at this place, the depth of flavour is unparalleled to any other Thai restaurant.  The service is excellent, fast, on point, and even if you only order a water, they're making sure that glass is always full.  Everything i ate tasted as close to Thai food as i have ever had in Canada, and every bite had complexity of flavours.  The interior and exterior is cute, and the place can really pack in a large number of people if you need to have a large dinner or something. Thus this is also a place i would recommend for groups because their special prix fix is extremely affordable and they can still provide you excellent service.    You must try the 54 chicken.  Mind blowing."}
{"text":"Ignore the price and Mengrai Thai is easily the best Thai restaurant in town. Lovely decor, friendly service, and kick-ass Thai food.  Most things on the menu are good, but the #44 Tofu Red Curry with Lychee ($17.50 or $18.50 with chicken) is perfect. Beautifully presented inside a hollowed out pineapple and wonderfully flavoured. Among the best Thai curries I've ever had, in Toronto or Thailand.  The price, though, is a little higher than I'd like and I'm removing a star for that. Once you include the rice you're looking at over $20 for a dish. It's worth it for this level of quality, but this makes Mengrai Thai more of a special occasion place for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to its reputation on every account. The food is amazing and authentic, however the reason you keep coming back is the generosity and hospitality. Chef Sasi and restaurant owner Allan always go above and beyond, and Mengrai is always the one place I tell all my new friends to go."}
{"text":"I always love Authentic Thai food (real Thai food as we can eat in Thailand). Been in Toronto for 30 years, never think Toronto Thai food can satisfy me, who I am a Chinese but more than half of my Uncle and Aunt are Thai. Finally, I found one tonight. This restaurant from decorations, Thai ice tea, rice containers, dishes, all made me felt like I am back to Thailand. The waiter, Tom is very nice and we can count on him to recommend best food to order. Owner Allan very nice from the time we called to make reservations and showing us how to park our car to greeting us at his restaurant, made me felt like going to visit my own uncle. Chef Sasi was very nice welcoming us and showing us her kitchen  The taste of the food is awesome! The best is the Braised Curry Lamb. The curry sauce was awesome with the addition of peach in it.  Looking forward for my next visit"}
{"text":"This is an amazing upscale Thai experience.  The Pumpkin Soup is so well-balanced, it will just leave you smiling.  We let the Chef choose our menu and everyone in our party of seven felt equally pleased.  If you want a great Thai experience, run to this restaurant!  It will leaving your palate dazzled, satisfied and grateful!  I just don't know how they could make this restaurant any better."}
{"text":"They have a big menu. Loved the tong yum soup, curries, and the pad thai (they have both versions: sweet, or original thai). The service was decent as well. We would definitely go back. Can't say it was authentic Thai food though."}
{"text":"they have gone out of business unexpectedly- after confirming a cooking class we showed up to no avail."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience here! The food was delicious and lovely old building was charming. The highlight was the kind and attentive service. It is a family friendly restaurant for sure -we brought with our 3 month old baby in a car-seat for a 5pm dinner, and this was our best dining with a baby experience so far! (they even offered to warm up the bottle we brought).  The owner Allan was very friendly and enthusiastic and gave us great recommendations, although everything on the menu looked good. We tried the lychee red curry in a pineapple, which was spectacular, and the panang curry which was very good, lots of chicken but we wish there had been a few more vegetables. The crispy morning glory appetizer was a perfect texture, very light and crispy. The chicken satay appetizer was delicious, but we wished that there were more skewers! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Situation: Wanted to organize a reunion type mean for my MBA crew; 14 people; set menu served family style  Service: They took care of us well - reservation process was super easy, Allan (part owner) was excellent in setting up everything from the menu to the timing and was equally willing to correspond via email; ambiance was cool: exposed brick, large rooms and lighting lent to an atmosphere of easy conversation (I wanted to sit in the 'Thai' room with the triangular pillows but our group was too big).  Food: Excellent, the spices and seasonings enhanced the taste of the main ingredients. The food came at the right time and in more than sufficient quantities to satisfy us.   My Faves:  1. Green mango salad - not usually a fan of mango in salads since restaurants usually use unripe mangoes which create a tartness in salads I don't like but Mengrai did it the right way;  2. Golden pumpkin soup - I expected pumpkin soup to be pretty boring but the spices and texture of the soup made me forget it was pumpkin. It tasted more like a mild curry than a soup and it worked!  3. Red curry chicken - loved the addition of lychee and pineapple although it made it more Malay-like than Thai. Nonetheless, I thought the flavours worked.   Regrets: We didn't get to try the Mango snowball and the substitute of creme-brulee with 3 kinds of crust (ginger, lemongrass, and another ingredient I could not identify) were disappointing (but I like basic creme-brulee so it's not surprising that I didn't like it). Next time I get the Mango snowball :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Mengrai for a very, very long time now. Despite the hype though, all of my high expectations were met.   When I first walked in to the large empty dining room at 5:30pm on what seemed to be a quiet weeknight, I was surprised when the host/server asked if I had a reservation. It was not until midway through our meal when I looked around to see that it had completely filled up and that there was even a line up at the door that I realized why making a reservation might have been a good idea.  The seasonal prix fixe menu ($35) is an outrageous deal and a full on adventure for your taste buds. There are four courses with both vegetarian and meat/fish options. First comes the chef's assorted appetizer which features four bite sized bundles of delightful colour, texture, and flavour. The second appetizer consists of light and crispy threads of Thai spinach tempura and a small bowl of fragrant golden pumpkin soup. It was very difficult to finalize a decision on the entree as there were so many attractive options, but I couldn't not go with the famous #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychees. Served in a hollowed out pineapple, it was decadently rich and went perfectly with the side of jasmine rice. The finale of sticky rice with fresh mango and your choice of ice cream (I chose lychee) was fantastic too.  Despite how busy it got, the service remained excellent throughout the evening. All in all, the warm atmosphere and tasteful decor along with the amazing food and service will definitely keep Mengrai on my mind until my next visit which will surely be soon."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday last night. Justin was our server and he was fantastic. The food was outstanding, will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure to dine here on numerous occasions as Mengrai easily boasts the most Delicious with a capital D Thai culinary experience one could have in Toronto.  The owner Alan is as always a gracious, and benevolent host all smiles and full of welcoming charm.  His wife Sasi is the culinary genius who rules the kitchen, churning out magically savoury oeuvres like the Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee which is in it's own category of otherwordly deliciousness.  To put it mildly if heaven served Thai food, then for sure I believe Sasi would be the Head Chef!  The atmosphere at Mengrai is intimately pleasing with rustic Thai style appeal, where exposed brick meets darkwood Thai relics and intricate gold embroidered details of traditional Thai textiles mix with weathered hardwood floors. So basically the interior looks like a marriage between a Thai antiques shop and a friendly local pub.  I came here tonite to celebrate a milestone birthday for a dear dear friend which was a surprise for her, and enjoyed one of the best meals I'd had in a very long time. With some clandestine advanced planning we'd had a chance to carefully orchestrate a special prix fixe birthday menu for 15 people at approximately $40+ per person (not including drinks), and of course Alan was super accomodating and helpful with the logistics of putting our birthday surprise meal together.  The meal was served ever efficiently by the expeditious servers with drinks to start in a bevvy of confectionary flavours like the Lychee Martini, Swedish Berry Martini (w/touch of banana liquer) and the Thai Snow which was the runaway favorite of the night served up with frothy coconut milk and a sugar rimmed glass!  Our first course consisted of various bite sized appetizers like  Mango Salad, Taro Yam Roll, Shrimp Triangle Wrapper Crisp Dumpling all of which were finger food-tastic!  The second course was the  Crispy Morning Glory paired with Golden Pumpkin Soup  which features light tempura battered Thai Spinach along with the most divine pumpkin soup with just a hint of spice that definitely hit the spot on this cold and dank night.  Alright now for the money shot, we were SPOILED with a Baccanalian array of Thai entrees which consisted of;  The amazing Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee  Filet Stripe Bass Tamarind Coconut  Grilled Traditionally Raised Beef Tenderloin w/pomegranate tamarind reduction  Street Style Pad Thai   and lastly the Special Pineapple Fried Rice served in a fresh pineapple for the birthday girl!!  Dessert was doubly delightful as we indulged in Thai Sweet Coconut Sticky Rice w/Fresh Mango along with Tropical Ice Creams.  The servers were even kind enough to bring out a cake with sparklers that we had brought in for the birthday girl ourselves and also sliced and served it up for us.  In summary, I felt like I was dining Roman orgy style via Thailand... minus the need for Twinrix vaccinations.  Seriously, I'd never experienced a food coma this transcendental.....If you haven't already dined at Mengrai, well my friend, then you are missing out on some exceptional Thai food!!!"}
{"text":"Red curry Thai and the ribs were my fav! Pad Thai is amazing place! Great service!   The best Thai food in the city!"}
{"text":"We ate here on our last night in Toronto. We were so amazed by the superb service and how friendly the staff were.   Finally, a good meal in Toronto.  I noticed Toronto really is not known for their food. We went with the course menu.  That sea bass and special red curry were delicious. And their cocktails was nice and tropical, my kind of drinks. One downfall is that I thought this place was pretty pricey for Thai food.  Although I don't see myself coming to Toronto again, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for a surprise birthday party. There were about 20 of us in total, who were all there for the Cooking Class. At $85/per head, the experience was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend this for a large group ever.   Alan the owner, was very nice and knowledgeable. He started off the afternoon with a (long) lesson about wine and Thai ingredients. We could've gone without the lessons about wine, but it was nice to learn about different ingredients they use.   Which brings me to the \"cooking class\" portion. We were separated into 3 groups, each cooking 3 different meals. I've never experience a cooking class before, but I assumed we would be prepping and cooking all of the ingredients. Instead, we were separated into different tables in the restaurant, surrounded by other customers trying to enjoy their meals. This was pretty awkward, as we felt we were intruding on their privacy, or lack there of.   The ingredients are already prepped for you. My group made fresh spring rolls, a curry, and basil beef. My 3 year old enjoyed making the spring rolls, but he was not able to partake in the other 2 dishes, as they were in the back kitchen (where the staff was cooking other people's meals....)  When it came time to cooking the curry and basil beef, this was where the entire experience fell apart for me. The kitchen staff was extremely nice and welcoming, but everything was already done for us. All we had to do was put the ingredients in the pot and mix. Voila. Some cooking class.   There was a lot of miscommunication with the staff here. When 20 people are paying $85 each, I would've expected MUCH better service. Before we were separated to cook, we were under the impression each table was getting 1 serving of EACH dish- sort of like a tasting menu. Alan then informed us there would be a winner who would receive a gift card. This never happened.   When we finally finished cooking and we're able to eat, we felt extremely rushed by the waitstaff. We were given take out containers WHILE STILL EATING. They even went as far to pack up our food- WHEN WE WERE STILL EATING! This really ruined our experience.   The restaurant started getting busy, which is why they started forcing us to leave. We were left hungry, and dissatisfied with our meal and felt for that $85 price tag we could've gone elsewhere. Oh, and drinks were not included in the $85 price tag.   I would not recommend this place to any group looking to do a cooking class."}
{"text":"We found this place because of the good reviews here, so thanks to everyone who posted. This is excellent Thai food. The only time I've had better Thai was in LA, and this is every bit as good as the top-notch Thai I had in Seattle and Portland.  We had Pad Thai (very good and different from what most American restaurants serve), a ginger stir fry that was excellent as well, and Sasi Golden Flowers for a tasty, light appetizer.  Cool vibe, excellent service, friendly servers, good wine list. Highly recommended, and good for vegetarians.  Head around the corner to Betty's for a drink after dinner..."}
{"text":"There's something about curry that I hate and love... I love it 'cause it's heavenly and tastes amazing especially when the lemongrass hits your taste buds..but I hate it 'cause I have to stop myself from eating 3 bowls of rice 'cause I swear rice + curry  = match made in heaven.  I guess you can tell what I had here.. yeah. curry. But I tried some new appetizers as well!  Golden Pumpkin Soup (7.5) - well-spiced and smooth but the portion was TINY! I don't recommend ordering this just because it's really really small and definitely not worth 7.5. You could pay a few extra dollars and get yourself a huge curry.  Dione Crispy Morning Glory (9) - This was basically a tempura, but with Thai spinach I think it was. When I eat tempura, I only eat vegetable tempura usually 'cause I'm not a huge fan of shrimp and this one didn't really impress although the chili sauce that was drizzled over it was really good. Other than that, not worth the money since it was more batter than spinach.  Coconut shrimp  Very crispy exterior with a lovely golden brown colour and inside was the shrimp which was very tender. It comes with a chili dipping sauce which made it superb. (Not on menu)  Chef Special Appetizer Platter for One (8.95) Mango Salad, Taro Yam Roll, Shrimp Triangle Wrapper, Crisp Dumpling. Everything was great. The mangos were actually ripe. Taro rolls were crispy and just delicious  Sasis Pad Thai (street style) (13.95)  There really wasn't anything special about this dish to be honest. It tasted like a normal pad thai to me. BUT I guess I have a bias here because I'm not much of a fan of pad thai. It's all about the curry.  Emerald Green curry (vegetarian) (12)  Not as flavorful as the red chicken curry, but still kick ass. with lots of vegetables and lovely flavours of lemongrass!  Sasi's #54 Red Chicken Curry with Lychee (18.50)  As usual, my favorite curry for sure with plentiful chunks of chicken, pineapple and lychee, how can you go wrong, man?  Overall: They still got it. In my opinion, I'd recommend the Red Chicken Curry and Chef Special Appetizer for sure."}
{"text":"A VerY good staff (at least the waiter we had because some others were looking much more rough).  Take original meals. Do not take usual thai stuff here: you will just be disappointed whereas you will be delighted by house specialties. Try royal coconut soup, curry with lychees, tenderloin with tamarind.  Will I go back? not sure but definitely a great experience and dinner."}
{"text":"They have awesome prix fixe deals and the morning glory and their fried shrimp appetizer is to die for!  I love their curry bass option, and I highly recommend those to order if they're a seafood fan.  Allan, Sasi and his team are superb and passionate of what they do and what they stand for - authentic thai food."}
{"text":"Tiny portion. Expensive. Very average flavour. Only thing worth trying is spicy pumpkin soup."}
{"text":"Was great and I will return. Probably several times. Nice place, higher end than most other thai restaurants in town. Food was great..we were a party of 8 and just ordered a bunch of different things the staff recommended. Was all great. Especially one of the dishes with dry fried beef...coconut chicken soup was really good as well, but not as good as the one at golden thai. The other thing was that several of the dishes came with too much sauce..also the service was not stellar.. Took a long time to get our orders done and always had to look out to get their attention.."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai in Toronto. Excellent service, AMAZING food, nice atmosphere, and surprisingly good prices. I've been looking for Sasi ever since The Restaurant at Sasi closed. The Sasi Pad Thai is heaven. Finish it off with a mango snowball.  You'll go back again and again - I can't wait to try the Prix Fixe for just $35. Alan is wonderful - makes you feel like family (only treats you better!). If you get a chance to meet the shy but brilliant Sasi - all the better!  STOP READING AND MAKE A RESERVATION!"}
{"text":"I decided to trust my fellow Yelpers and try this place again. And I must say, I really enjoyed myself this time.   Service was fabulous (unlike the last time I went). We were offered helpful suggestions, and a complimentary appetizer and steamed rice. Kudos to the man who was serving us. Takes customer satisfaction very seriously.  Now the food. Spring rolls were meh. Mini size, oozing oil (and tasting of it) and nothing great to taste. The rest of the meal made up for it. The mushroom and veggie stirfry was excellent. Great quality mushrooms, and a light sauce. The red curry and penang curry were great as was the fried rice (which was interestingly served in a scooped pineapple). Portions were really great and three of us couldn't finish three dishes.  Unfortunately, their fabulous green tea creme brule was sold out, and so we decided to skip dessert (weren't hungry anyway).  The only reason I take off one star - we were seated next to the kitchen. It was noisy and not a pleasant sight. Hope to get a better seat the next time!"}
{"text":"Saturday night is a busy night for this place, but boy did they make us feel great. My boyfriend and I got the \"prix fixe\" which was 35 dollars each - a sort of sampler menu although there are cheaper options available. It was great value and I took a whole meal home for the next day. It included an appetizer platter, a second appetizer with soup, main course, and desert. The waiter was ultra friendly, went out of his way to refill water and the manager stopped by our table before we left to ask how everything went (which I consider good restaurant etiquette). The food was served very quickly, even though they were busy and was superb! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about this place.   The menu has quite a few options and I like that they take resos, but the food left something to be desired. It wasn't bad, but a bit bland and nothing special. The pad thai is really one dimensional as other reviews have stated, and sadly it reminded me of food court thai food.I much prefer salad king, khao san road or pai.  Another annoyance was the service. The owner gave us the same sales pitch as mentioned in multiple other reviews....showed us all the photos on his phone of the celebs that have eaten there, showed us his kids, then tried to sell us on his charity in Thailand (though still not sure what exactly he is selling? does he want money or us to come volunteer??). I like the personal touch and that he comes around to interact with guests but it was a bit much. I was in a pretty deep convo with my friend who I have not seen in a while, and he kept interrupting and would overstay his welcome at our table. It felt like most of the night we were just humouring him and it took away from our evening.   My biggest complaint is that this place has Gluten Free claims written all over the menu and seemed like it had a lot of options for people with allergies. I did my due diligence and called before I mad the reso and they confirmed the food would be safe for celiacs and that they would make sure they made my food safely (i.e. new pan and utensils). Well, we ordered 3 gluten free dishes and ten minutes after ordering, our server came back to tell us these were actually not gf, despite it being listed on the menu. With confused faces we switched to three other gf menu items and again ten minutes later he came back to tell us those weren't gf either :/  Why are you listing items as gf on your menu if they are not????? I appreciate that he double checked for me, but at the end of the day, don't friggin advertise a dish as not containing an allergen when it really does. And don't tell me in the phone prior to my visit that you can accommodate celiacs when you, in fact, cannot. If you are going to make gf claims then you need to take it seriously."}
{"text":"Went to Mengrai Thai on Dec 10th, love this restaurant! Exceptional service and amazing delicious food. Thank you Allan Lim for making my visits at Mengrai Thai always special.  You must experience Chef Sasi Meechai's menu creation.  Strongly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about Mengrai. Weve been here 3 times. We even took our parents here cause we loved it so much. Each time its been amazing. The service is great and the dishes are just soooo full of flavour. I love their curries and their pad thai...and weve had a few of their fish dishes which were also super good. I recommend going with a group and ordering the 3-course meal. Soooo delicious.   As a tip...mengrai holds cooking classes as well. Ive been tempted so many times to sign up but the 100.00 per person price tag is a bit steep...for 2 it would be 200.00.... so were goign to do a cooking class in Thailand for our honeymoon instead. :)   All in all, my favorite thai restaurant for fine-dining."}
{"text":"The curries were delicious and filled with flavour. Mengrai has a lot of curries that you wouldn't find elsewhere - really interesting ingredients.   Unfortunately, the pad Thai was mediocre at best and I really hoped it would taste better because it would definitely bump up my view of this place. We had other appetizers such as the morning glory and crispy prawns, which I felt were nothing special, but still tasted good."}
{"text":"This is the best thai restaurant I've ever been to!!!The waiter made great suggestions on dishes we should try and the owner was more than welcoming. You can tell him and his wife really care about the art of food and that he really takes care of his employees. We ordered the morning glory and yaro rolls. It was delicious and the sauces it came with really brought out the flavor. The sasi pad thai is the best pad thai and comes with a lot ( shrimp, chicken, tofu.) My bf had the red curry dish and the coconut base was amazing. I would definitely come again when visiting Canada."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey, expect to spend at least 50$ a person to enjoy the full experience. The place is pretty cozy, with low ceilings I felt like I was at someone's home enjoying a home cooked meal. The novelty on how they display the food is impressive as well, but you pay for the novelty. A appetizer bowl of soup cost $8, if you want it served in a fresh coconut, it cost $18..    I tried the coconut soup in the regular bowl... I couldn't justify paying another $10 on top only because it's served in a coconut that cost $2 in the supermarket. I only had the vegetable one but the variety of vegetable is good enough for me.  From the royal menu my friend and I decided to try the avocado prawn. $18, serves 2 It was a petite sized bite size appetizer - 1 pcs of shrimp each with 2 pcs of cucumber with panang curried guacamole on top. A definite must-try ! Too bad it's so small tho, i wanted more ! For entry, I followed fellow yelper's advice and tried #54 , nothing else on the royal menu had any number on it except for that one...  so dont worry you'll spot it. It;s their house special red curry with chicken, lychee, and pineapple. The curry was served in a pineapple.. like I said, back to the novelty. I personally didn't like the lychee.. the red curry soaked up all the sweet flavour, it was really soggy. There's absolutely no vegetables in the curry like the other Thai places. I would highly recommend the coconut rice!. Just a hint of coconut small enough to notice, but wouldn't ruin the curry. For dessert I tried the lemongrass creme brulee. I wouldn't suggest trying it if you're wodnering. The fact that there's lemon grass in it sounded exotic but it tasted like a regular non-sweet creme brulee.  My overall experience was pretty good. Would I come back? Definitely.  But it's not going to be my go-to place for thai food."}
{"text":"Mengrai Gourmet Thai is a perfect \"date\" restaurant if your date enjoy some Thai food, intimate atmosphere, attentive services.   Food here is definitely a tuned down version of Thai food as the spice level is really tuned down even when we requested Thai spicy and some of the dishes did tasted a little bland.  Love the appetizer that was suggested by our friendly waiter. Divine Morning Glory lightly breaded and deep fried topped with tarminard sauce. The combination in taste and texture definitely made me excited to the main courses that coming up next.  Crisp Filet Whole Red Snapper in Spicy Red Curry sauce ($26.95) - love the presentation with the whole fish head and tail as decoration or maybe one of my Yelp friends can suck on the head? - The fish is lightly battered but lack the much expected complex taste in Thai cuisine  Red Chicken Curry with Lychee ($18.50) - love the presentation but the sweetness of lychee really mellow the curry taste - A meh for me  Original Thai Style Pad Thai Noodles ($12) - I love Pad Thai noodle, this is a really good version as the noodle has great bite and the sauce is sweet but tasty  Stick with the Sticky Rice ($3)! Love the representation in that little bamboo basket just like it is served in Thailand. The Coconut Rice ($3) though was under cooked and some of the rice was hard  We finished our meal with a happy ending.. Mango Snowball ($4) or should it be call Ginger Snowball? As it is Coconut Sticky Rice with Ginger Ice Cream on the side.. Love Ginger!  I definitely suggest Mengrai if you need a nice restaurant for a romantic date! The dim lighting, the relax vibe and they takes reservations too! The food is decent enough... Love is in the air!"}
{"text":"Part of the allure of dining at Mengrai is meeting its owners, Allan Lim and Sasi Meechai. They're a dynamic team--the perfect balance of spicy and sweet--much like a Thai dish. Allan is exuberant and is in his element in his front-of-house role, kibitzing with diners, pulling out his phone to show photos of celebrities who have dined there (Jessica Alba and Mick Jagger, to name a few) and making you feel like you're part of his family. Sasi, on the other hand, is more reserved and prefers being behind-the-scenes--where she does her best work as an award-winning chef. It's one of the few restaurants in Canada that has received the prestigious Thai Premium Select Certification by the Royal Thai Government--a high honour.  From the minute you walk in, Allan rolls out the red carpet and makes you feel like you're an A-list celebrity, giving you his full attention and bringing dishes to sample on the house. As for the food, Sasi trained in Thailand, so the mechanics of her authentic Thai cuisine are spot on: the curries flavourful, the soups velvety and the deep-fried spring rolls crispy."}
{"text":"This might actually be the best Thai food place in the city, but take this with a grain of salt coming from someone who is really no expert when it comes to Thai food. All I know is that I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's in this kind of random part of town which is surrounded by virtually nothing else and to be honest the area feels kind of sketchy, especially if you are walking alone at night. The inside of the restaurant is pretty nice though, pretty cozy, definitely caters to an older crowd and is quieter and more intimate than Khao San Road or Pai - it just overall feels kind of fancier and classier, a good kind of date setting if you can overlook the overabundance of Buddha(?) statues in the small space (there was one RIGHT beside our table.)  I think a lot of the menu items here are really unique, as I haven't seen them on any other menus. Of course, they also have the usual standard curry options and pad thai. To start, I ordered the divine crispy morning glory paired with golden pumpkin soup. The soup was okay, I think it was pretty light in terms of the flavour, but then again that's just the way pumpkins taste. The morning glory was crispy as advertised, and I suppose while not quite in the realm of \"divine\" it was still pretty good. Basically it is like tempura spinach and comes with this sweet kind of like plum sauce on the side. I would get this again just because I really like tempura.  For my main, I had to try the #54 red chicken curry with lychee which is apparently their super famous, signature, award-winning dish. Points for presentation because it comes served in a pineapple. Other than that... I mean, I liked it, it was quite flavourful, although I was expecting and would have preferred a strong lychee flavour. But it was still there, albeit subtle, so it was a bit different and interesting. I ordered a side of rice to go with my curry, and at one point during the meal they noticed that I had a lot of curry still left over, so gave me an extra bowl on the house.   Overall, I think the main thing I like about this place is the uniqueness of their dishes. For instance, there is some kind of flower appetizer which sounds very interesting and that I would want to try on a future visit. The staff here are pretty friendly and were chatting with us before we left, like asking us for our names and everything and getting all personal. It seems like they have a lot of regular customers here who they know on a personal level so that is pretty neat. I think for any Thai food lovers this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant in Toronto in my opinion. The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect, the staff are friendly and the food is extremely flavourful.  If you have a food allergy/dietary need (such as being vegan) they're more than willing to accommodate.  My wife and I go here pretty often and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"closer to 3.5 actually.  I've come to this restaurant more than a handful of times over the last 2 years, mostly due to my SO's love affair with the green curry here which convinces him that this place is the best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Don't get me wrong, it is good food but its definitely not the best. IMHO, Nuit Regular's food is more flavorful than Sasi's. the following review is based on my group dinner date on a Saturday night:  Restaurant: good ambiance, appropriate for groups, dinner dates (casual and romantic), meeting the in-laws. The restaurant was packed on a saturday night, no line up but every table was full. It wasnt loud, the music blaring like some restaurants, but Was softly playing in the background. It's a modern decor that's industrial with Thai statues around the perimeter. Half the restaurant is on a lowered floor with exposed brick and high ceilings, the bench alongside the wall has pillows and cushions in cotton with a Thai-inspired pattern. This section of the restaurant much have insulation problems (no insulation?) as there was a heating lamp on the floor at the bottom of the staircase making some of our guests very warm.   Service: mostly ok. the servers were polite and frequently refilled our waters. Our food all came out at the same time, but no one came to check on us to see how the food was. However a few mishaps that are worth mentioning. One group required another two person table but the table they brought was extremely unstable. In order to stabilize it the waitstaff tried to wedge a baby seat under the table, and then added a pillow onto the baby seat to provide the added height to the seat. Not surprisingly this did not work. Although amusing to watch, it certainly wasn't professional and i was sort of dismayed because you would expect a restaurant like this to have an extra table or a table that isn't wobbling like jello. The other thing worth mentioning is that they had a table cloth and another table very very close to the space heater, so close that we felt it was necessary to move it away a few inches. This was also sloppy on the part of the staff. Of course these may have been one offs, so take it for what it's worth.   Food: i can safely say that we've tried half the menu here. the food isn't revolutionary, but it's presented beautifully and tastes pretty good. some of the dishes remind me of bastardized chinese food actually - where it's a stirfry with a thick overly salty or sweet sauce. the pineapple fried rice comes in a pineapple which is a nice for presentation; very fragrant dish. the pad thai here is good but for me, nothing to write home about. same comment to the various spring rolls and appetizers. i will comment that they do a beautiful job in their frried food - not greasy at all. i've certainly had better. the curries here are excellent and what i usually recommend to our guests and they always enjoy it. the thai iced tea is too sweet for me dispite being a fave drink of mine."}
{"text":"Nice thai restaurant. More upscale than your average restaurant. Came here as a party and they require a minimum 25 / person for reservation.  This worked out fine as their Prix Fixe menu is 25. Everything was nice. I particular like the desert sticky rice + coconut ice cream. Heard ginger was nice too. For the main entree, I ordered the red curry. They have a very granular spicy level of 1 to 12 for the red curry. And the waitress claimed when I asked her that they can make it as spicy as you want.  I asked for a 10, and she went flush in shock. I was a quite intimidated after that, but actually 10 turned out to be quite right. I could probably handle a 12, but 10 is nice. I cannot handle too much spice too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Period. There are so many good reviews about the food I'm not even going to bother listing dishes off since I've ripped through most of their menu, please just read those reviews. Been here so many times over the past few years as I used to work down the street. Clients, friends, family, everyone I've taken here absolutely loves the place and the food is fantastic. The service is usually good, but never as good as the food. Its never been terrible, but my advice  would be to make nice with the manager when you come in or get seated and your table will be well looked after. They get really busy, are in a weird area, and its a family run joint [or at least feels that way] so don't expect 5-star service but the food is great and you won't have to punch your way through mustache-waxing-flannel-obsessed hipsters just to get a table. Cough cough, I'm looking at you Khao San Road....!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, amazing eclectic mix of flavors, and excellent staff! I agree..this IS the best Thai food we have ever had! I called ahead and spoke to the owner, Alan; he proudly told me his wife is the chef. We had made a reservation for a large group, but with flight delays, were only 6 people. They were very accomodating about the change, when i called to inform we might be late, as well. SO glad we chose Mengrai; our waitress was a lovely, sweet young lady who recommended the pre-fixe style dinner. The price was very good, especially for the variety and quality of the food! We had some tofu/vegetarian dishes, chicken, and shrimp appetizers and entrees, as well. Every dish was beautifully presented, and the flavor mix was perfect! For dessert, we got to choose ice creams, and I have to say our choice of coconut ice cream was the perfect, light, sweet ending to a memorable dinner!  The restaurant has cool rooms, hardwood floors, and comfortable seating; perfect for a romantic dinner, dinner to catch up with friends (the noise level is at a perfect lower level, as is the music), or, as we did, to entertain clients and business contacts...they were impressed..and so were we! I can see the staff would happily participating in making any event special..a marriage proposal.? Perfect! Can't wait to go back...makes me wish Texas was Lots closer to Toronto, and Mengrai Gourmet Thai! (p.s. we walked from Sheraton Centre, downtown..about a 20 minute walk we were very glad for ,after our wonderful meal..the streets are not busy, but we felt safe. it is in a quieter section of the city. Taxi would be resonable,and parking was easily found, as well. We just wanted to enjoy the cool night.)"}
{"text":"After all the great reviews (yelp and pre-yelp), I've given this place chance after chance: everything from sit downs to take out and even the cooking lessons.  I just can't love Mengrai. The reason you see amazing reviews is because of plating and creativity, not taste.  Food is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't compare in quality and especially in price to options you can get around the corner (Sukho Thai is the champ, and even Golden Thai is better). They are heavy on the fish sauce, and I find it overwhelms most of the dishes its in.  Really great service and friendly staff. It's a nice \"thai looking\" place to bring the parents, but it's not as authentic or tasty as all the fancy accouterments would have you believe."}
{"text":"Hosted my birthday dinner here for a super large group and it was amazing. The staff is so dedicated to making your night wonderful. They made us feel welcomed and in return, all of my guests were very happy with dinner. Food quality and variety was wonderful. We had a group dining menu that's more concentrated. Food came out quickly and looked so beautiful. Thank-you Mengrai for making my birthday the best one I've yet to have! Thank-you Allan for coordinating everything and thank-you Brandon for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'd call the neighbourhood this place is in \"corktown\", it feels more like regent park and the surroundings look a little sketchy. All that aside the food here is hands delicious and the atmosphere is laid back. I ordered the Lemongrass Coconut soup to start. It was tasty, but nothing too special. The main course though was amazing: I had the lamb with peach curry and it was hands down one of the best meals I've had in toronto. I also ordered a capuccino here and it was not bad.  The atmosphere is very dimly lit and a small space, I would recommend this more for a date rather than a friend's get together, though when we went there we saw what appeared to be a birthday party. The staff was also super friendly and the service was fast even though it was crowded.  Reserve a spot in advance because the place is small, and there really isn't anywhere around where you can hang out to wait for a table."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We had the evening's prix fix menu.  The waiter was excellent and knowledge about menu.  He was very flexible, allowing us to mix and match the excellent appetizer.  The fried tofu entre tasted even better the next day.  The popular chicken curry was \"ok\" ~ 3 stars.  I thought the combo of lychee, coconut milk and spices was interesting.  We really enjoyed the very simple but tasty coconut rice pudding with the side of green tea icecream ... 5 stars for the dessert."}
