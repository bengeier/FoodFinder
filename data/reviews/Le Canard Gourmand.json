{"text":"One of the best meals we've ever had in Quebec. Ended a delightful Saturday touring the southwestern reaches of the Eastern Townships buying honey, chocolate, baked goods, apples, wine and ice wine ... with an early evening dinner at Le Canard Gourmand in Farnham. Huge kudos for featuring local Quebec wines, including an inventive four-course tasting menu with four Eastern Township wine pairings (we weren't that hungry to try it this visit. But next ...). There's also a healthy selection of French and Italian wines. The farm-to-table menu is small, but well constructed and makes it tough to make a decision. The meal started with a small cup of gazpacho as an amuse bouche. Perfect. For appetizers my wife had an lettuce salad with all sorts of crunchy goodies, I had a rabbit terrine complemented with a terrific peach confiture. For mains, we both couldn't resist the duck breast with red cabbage and apple in a fruit sauce. For desert, you have to have the creme brûlée made with a local maple syrup liquor, Courer de Bois. One of the best creme brûlées ever. The staff is more than capable of serving you in English; English menus are available. The hostess is very welcoming/inviting, checking in with every guest. Next time, instead of touring the Eastern Townships and ending up at Le Canard Gourmand by happenstance, we'll be planning our Eastern Townships visit around dinner at Le Canard Gourmand. It's a little less than an hour from Montreal ... so if you have a car, there's no excuse to pass this one up."}
{"text":"Just went there for a Easter brunch cozy as always... the people serving you are always in a happy mood... It's a great place to stop when passing in Farnham... really good bacon.... great food... I've been stopping there since my dad moved to Farnham. Just in front there's a SAQ so vine bottles or whiskey... can easily be added to your meal depending on the time... It's always been a great place for family dege, dinner or supper when in two... If your looking for a casual time this is the place... friendly environment... close to shopping centers right in back..."}
