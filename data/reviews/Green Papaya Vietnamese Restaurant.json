{"text":"This restaurant was decent, but it has since closed down and been converted into \"a taste of India\". Awesome lunch Buffett!"}
{"text":"There is a Vietnamese noodle house very near the Kincora subdivision that is tucked away at the local mall.  As far as Pho restaurants go this location is very different in that it is ultra modern; it has sleek designs with black tiling, minty green colors plus they even have black chopsticks.

The food is very fresh here but lacks a little on taste.  The Pho doesn't have the richness of broth than usual Pho restaurants and I found myself adding sauces on the table to the mix, which isn't a good sign.  There are small bowls and a large bowls to choose from, but both are a little higher priced than the average Pho but perhaps you are paying a little bit more for the newer restorations."}
{"text":"There are quite a few Vietnamese restaurants out there, most of which are pretty decent.  And Green Papaya is no exception to this.

They offer the usual Vietnamese dishes like pho, vermicelli and rice but at a bit better price.  For the most part, one person can eat there for under $10.  That obviously excludes any large or fancy drinks, though.  The portions are big, tasty and definitely filling.

I didn't notice anything too exceptional about the service, but they got the job done.  We were served quickly but there wasn't much interaction between our table and the waitress.  I guess sometimes that's not such a bad thing."}
