{"text":"Best sushi around! The all you can eat menu is very good and you can tell that the chefs put good time into there food. The 4th person eats free deal is great for groups of friends and who doesn't love a byob?!   My family comes here at least twice a week and the service is great. Good vibes  Bravo"}
{"text":"It was our first time here doing all you can't eat option. Firstly, the AYCE menu selection was extremely limited. Every single sushi roll we ordered tasted exactly the same, essentially shrimp crab avocado and cucumber. None of traditional sushi rolls like green dragon, spider, California weren't available.  The restaurant itself is okay. We came here from downtown because it got 4 stars, this place however is not a 4 star sushi place. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the service was really good. Far better AYCE sushi downtown."}
{"text":"Sushis pour apporter se font extrêmement rapidement! Délicieux et frais! La caissière est toujours très aimable. La salle n'est pas si grande mais très relaxante!"}
{"text":"Bon prix et bonne bouffe. Bon choix dans les Sushis et les prix don intéressant aussi pou le take-out."}
{"text":"Petite place relaxe pour manger des sushis. Dans le coin c'est ma place favorite ils ont vraiment de bon sushis. Les dragon eye et la pizza sushi sont mes préférés!"}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent, but there are too many \"rules\". On the menu they state that they will come around a max of 3 times, and you will be charged for every 50g of food left.   One thing which the waitress could have done as we were seated, was to tell us that the kitchen would be closing soon. We were definitely rushed."}
{"text":"Delicious! $20 for all you can eat. Only 3 services allowed so order a bit of what you want to try on the first service but not too much because they charge 1$ per 50 g wasted."}
{"text":"Greeting Sushi lover. This sushi place have a good sashimi the sushi is very nice but the choices are limited. The grilled squid are very nice but the portion you can not see t under miroscop. The witress is very nice but the kitchen is slow and forgets order. Some orders on the menu like macricle that i love they do not have. you can bring your win . the excuse for them is they are just opened couple of month ago. they are not open lunch time. I will, check them later on in couple of monthes to see if they improved. for 19.50 supper during the day week not so bad."}
