{"text":"It's kinda crap, let's be honest. It's very American and it survives based on the fact that so many people without taste come from the suburbs as well as the States to frequent the club district, thus keeping Montana's open. Now, having said that, anywhere with quick service is good for a lunch time beer. And they do the CHUM Christmas party there every year and I have to say, it's a great venue and they handle it really well. The food is decent, the layout is good, and the service is great."}
{"text":"horrible!!!!!! omg! the food is so bad here. everything i had was like rubber, over cooked,over spiced, and wayyyy toooo expensive."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best brunch in the city. I went here a couple weeks ago on a double brunch date and the food was so delicious. 

I had a shrimp eggs benedict that came with potatoes and a chunky tomato salsa and it was delectable. The shrimp was so tender and the hollandaise sauce was rich and tangy and the eggs were as runny and delicious as can be. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful. We sat outside on the modest sizes patio but the inside of the restaurant is huge; high ceilings, tons of seating and great bright decor. 

The service is great - fast and friendly coffee refills. I actually ended up talking to our server once for about half an hour during one visit. It's not the cheapest brunch in the world (about $12 for the shrimp eggs benny) but the food is of a great quality and tastier than your average greasy spoon. 

The thing I like best about this place is that it's never busy for brunch - so if you're looking for a great place downtown to grab a bite after a hard night of partying, this is a solid bet."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, Montana deserves more credit!
As a previous reviewer mentioned, there does not seem to be much of an association with the chain Montana's. 
The selection at the bar is pretty good and while the menu is standard American fare, it tastes right and is prepared fairly quickly. 
There is a dance/event space on the second floor, and although I have heard good things, I have not been there.

In brief, from the selection of bar/restaurants with Patio on the over-rated Richmond strip, Montana is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"I was here for a private event in their M Lounge.  The staff were great and accomodating to all of our needs.  There was a slight miscomunication in that they thought we had booked for 7:00 when we had booked for 6:30 so things were a little rushed to get the place ready before our guests showed up.

When it came time for dinner you could easily see that they don't normally do sit down dinners for 140 people.  It took a little while to get the ball rolling but once they got going things fell into place.  The food was your standard meat and potatos.  No complaints here but it wasn't anything that wow'd me.

Overall this is a good place for dinner in the entertainment district but nothing out of the ordinary."}
