{"text":"J ai vraiment aime le service et la nourriture. Manger le canard et le filet de porc sauce au bluet. Le potage étais correct mais le désert tarte au fromage délicieuse . J ai pris un 5 service pour 42  très abordable et c est un apporter votre vin un plus."}
{"text":"I've eaten my way through this entire city, from top to bottom, and think this place is probably the best French restaurant in the city, bar none. It's really small but neat, clean, classy, and very intimate.   White glove service where the waiters and staff treat you like ROYALTY, respectful of your choices and delicately making suggestions to improve your experience. No matter how ghetto the wine you bring is (BYOW) they always have something positive to say about it.   The food is absolutely unbelievably amazing. I can't even begin to describe it. I used to HATE French food - until I went to L'Entrepont and it turned me around completely.   Anyways, enough rambling. The best, go check it out."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in Montreal for 1 night and decided to get dinner here. The restaurant is on a quiet, residential street. At first we both thought we had the wrong address; however, when you get to the front of the restaurant it is a small but very nice. There are only 9 tables here so make sure you get a reservation! They were very accommodating with ours as we switched it a few times because we got last minute tickets to the Montreal Canadiens hockey game.  We had decided to both get the 5 course tasting menu and the food was amazing! The best part of our meals were the main courses - we had the bison and the duck. I highly recommend getting either. Lastly, the chef came out to our table at the end of the meal which was super nice of him.   Please keep in mind this place is BYOW - there is an SAQ nearby (only a 7 minute walk)."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. But this place will fail and here is why: They are trying to provide sophisticated cuisine but this caused them to get quite pricy and the outside appearance of the restaurant do not match with the pricing.  \"Bistro\" in your name, white walls, simple furniture, tasteless door frame, no curtains, super quiet street, a BYOB, no playlist. All the ambiance is screaming modesty and therefore you will find it too pricy. You don't invite your girlfriend here for a fancy night and you don't spend that kind of money for a night between buddies.  Lower the price at quality cost or have it redecorate. Food was delicious though."}
{"text":"We bought a coupon and visited the establishment one very cold evening, the place dead, us and one other couple. The waiter was super friendly we could tell he enjoys what he does. We ordered the 5-course meal and felt overall it was just ok. The soup was so hot it was hard to eat and wasn't too tasty. The ris de veau was good and we also liked the lamb but didn't think much of the escargots and one of the desserts. The place has been around for a long time but I feel there are better choices out there."}
{"text":"Nous étions 4 personnes 4 plats différents avec la même sauce??? Nos 4 plats n'étaient pas chaud. Serveur propriétaire très gentil: Merci"}
{"text":"Found this place on the travelchannel website the first night we got to Montreal during a quick weekend trip.  It isn't cheap, but this splurge was a fabulous way to start our trip.  Just a few blocks from the Mont-Royal metro station, it is actually a tiny place wedged in a residential neighborhood.  There weren't more than 10 tables, and the atmosphere was very homey and intimate.  We decided to all do the 5-course option, which ranged from 48-55 bucks depending on which main course you ordered.     The meal started with a cream of vegetable soup.  Simple and boring you might think, but it was very yummy and made us all excited for what was to come.    I then had the escargots as my appetizer, and it was absolutely heavenly.  I am a big fan of escargots, and this dish reminded me why.  The blue cheese sauce it was in was subtle but delicious, and I sopped up every last drop with my bread.    Next came a palate cleanser of sorts - a scoop of green apple sorbet dropped in some brandy.  Everyone in our group LOVED this - especially as the sorbet melted in the brandy.  I had never had anything like this during a meal, so it was a really pleasant surprise.    For my main dish, I had the roasted quail, which I found to be well-seasoned in a nice wine sauce.  All the main entrees came with the same sides - a mix of seasonal vegetables.  The other entrees ordered included the duck dish, the filet mignon, and even the kangaroo (I got a bite- it was surprisingly tender and tasted sorta like beef).    Dessert was a trio of sorbets.  Although not the highlight of the meal, it was a nice and light way to end the night.  The service was great here, even though there seemed to be only one waiter running the place.  Another great thing about this place?  You can bring your own wine!  No corkage fee, and they'll even chill your white wine for you.   Good thing we had stopped by the NH liquor store on our way there!  Highly recommended, especially if you can't get a reservation at the famed \"au pied du cochon\" or \"l'express,\"..."}
{"text":"Un très bon bistro caché sur la rue hotel-de-ville ! De la bouffe française excellente  De plus, le restaurant est un apporté votre vin !   Le menu 5 service coute environ 52$ , mais le potage et le trou-normand sont très très bons !  La serveuse que nous avons eue était parfaite aussi !   Franchement j'ai bien aimé !"}
{"text":"Great ambience if you are looking for a cozy place tucked in a residential neighbourhood. The entrees are exotic and a little pricey but the corkage free BYOW makes up for it. I would have given it 5 stars but the veggies were soaked in too much oil.  Wait staff are great!  $200 for party of 4."}
{"text":"Drove by this tiny bistro while we were circling around for parking. Boy was I glad we stopped in to try it! Not only is it BYOB (apportez votre Vin), they have a great prix fix menu at either $38 (3 course)or $54 (5 course). Of course hubster and i decided to go for the five course. Go big or go home right?!! You won't regret it! The foie was seared to perfection. The duck I had was on point.  We were chatting with the super friendly owner for a bit and he even shared some of his fave places to hit in Montreal. We will be back for you!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very friendly staff, romantic atmosphere.  Owner comes to the table and describes the options for you.  Intimate little restaurant with food as good as it gets.  5 course meal came to $50 per person, and was worth much more.  I would eat here every night if I could.  Thank you for making our trip to Montreal memorable."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this cozy restaurant for an intimate and memorable experience. The service is attentive and professional. The food looks as good as it tastes. There is no corkage fee to bring your own wine.  I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a quiet weekday night. There is nothing special about the facade of the tiny restaurant. As you enter, you realize that there is only a few tables. We were seated comfortably next to the window and began reading the menu. Options include Bison flank steak, lamb cutlets, rabbit rillette, grilled venison, duck magret, etc. We ultimately ordered the 5-course table d'hote and it was an excellent decision.  Each course came swiftly and the chef even came by to present himself. Every plate was pleasant to taste and to smell. The scrumptious vegetables and succulent meats were chowed down zealously.  Overall, it was an extremely pleasant and enjoyable dining experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good points. This is an adorable spot, very cosy and the service was incredible. In fact they tried to address everything that went wrong with the food but in a town like Montreal I'm not sure that getting subpar food can be covered up by good service. The prices are very good and you can bring your own wine which is always nice for the budget conscious option. That being said the food was not exactly the best. We had the 5 course meal and some of it was good but not fantastic. The soup was super heated and it made it difficult to enjoy. It was also seriously lacking in seasoning. I never feel the need to add salt but i had to here. The appetizers were just ok, again lacking in seasoning. The main meal was pretty solid. The Duck leg confit was very very good as were the Ris de Veau. The sides on the main were boring and plain however. Some sort of undercooked potato dish that seem undercooked and underseasoned. The desserts were just plain awful. We actually sent it back. The creme brule was so burnt it was black (not sure how that left the kitchen actually) and the sorbet was freezer burned and tasting like it. As I said they tried to address the issue by offering us more desserts (which we turned down, not exactly inspired by their food at that point) and reducing the price on our bill. Still not sure we'll be back however."}
{"text":"True to their word, extremely pocket book friendly! However, keep in mind, to keep the food prices down, drink prices are rather high...stick to drinking water and you'll have a tasty meal for almost nothing ;) nice and cosy   atmospere with different table sizes to accomodate intimate to group sizes :)"}
{"text":"Bon petit bistro ! Situé en pleine zone résidentielle du Plateau Mont-Royal, ce petit bistro classique ''apportez votre vin'' est simple et la nourriture délicieuse et bien apprêtée. Il y a à peine de la place pour 30 personnes assises. On était un groupe de 4 personnes un mercredi soir et il n'y avait qu'un autre couple dans la salle. Assez tranquille quoi. Rien à redire sur la nourriture, mes convives ont bien aimés. Les champignons en entrée étaient succulents ainsi que le filet mignon. Je vous suggère le 5 services (potage / entrée / granité / plat principal / dessert) qui vous reviendra moins cher que de choisir à la carte. Bon service du serveur qui était sympa. Le chef est venu à la fin pour nous demander notre opinion sur la nourriture et le service. Déco très simple et normal d'un petit bistro de quartier. Total de l'addition avec taxes + pourboire inclus pour 4, 290$. Au final, tout le monde a bien mangé et été satisfaits. Si vous recherchez un petit bistro ''apportez votre vin'' discret situé ''hors rues principales'', vous avez trouvés."}
{"text":"Montreal has the most restaurants per capita of any city in the world so whatever you do DO NOT MISS this place... say hello to Chef and owner Michaël Bouchard! Make a reservation to snag one of the 28 seats in this intimate, hidden gem... and its BYOW-- apportez votre vin!"}
