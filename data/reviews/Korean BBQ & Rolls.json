{"text":"Amazing food. They are the nicest people. They give you so much food. While you are eating they keep bringing more for you to try. Everything we ate was delicious. We will be back before we leave town!"}
{"text":"My husband and daughter wanted to try this place because they were craving Korean food.  Upon entering the door, we saw a group of young people sitting in one table and 4 or 5  small tables that obviously needed to be cleared.  The person managing the place  immediately talked to us apologizing that he cannot serve us because he hasn't cleaned up and he has the group of people to serve.  We were basically kicked out for the first time in our lives.  We were in total disbelief!"}
{"text":"After all the good reviews, I dont have to tell you how great the service is especially it is only run by husband and wife.  Sometime I dont know how they can manage it.  I wanted to support them as much as i can, so i introduced this place to my coworkers and we had a luncheon there. Of course, its a great experience and excellent food.

Mr. Lee closed the restaurant two hours just for us.  Even though some of my coworkers didnt show up, so i told him its ok to let other customers to come in, then he told me its ok and he couldnt really take more customers at the time.  

I truly feel that his main purpose to open this restaurant is to serve good food, make people happy and they enjoy doing it, not because of making money.  Where can i find this type of owners or business nowadays?  They are so special that i would be sad if they go out of business :(.

Also, i have to thanks yelp because without the app, i cant find this place especially for a 34-week-prego woman, i really need it. :)"}
{"text":"Wow!  Bad experience! 
 
I decided to give this place a try because I like korean food and a friend recommended it.  So, I drove out of my way to try it, hoping I could enjoy a late lunch.  I walked in at ~1 p.m. on a weekday.  It was fairly busy, but  there was an open 2-top. People were eating and being served. 

The owner/chef told me that they would NOT seat me, and I should come back in about 45-50 minutes. I wasn't even offered the opportunity for take away. Just leave and come back later....and this with a table sitting open.

It appears that they can't handle a full restaurant and don't have good management skills.  As others have noted, this is a small place, too.   

So, if you happen to be in the area, you might get served provided that they are not busy. Otherwise, you should make sure that you have a fair amount of leisure time at your disposal.  At this point, it's not a place you can go if you have any time constraints, e.g.,  having only an hour for lunch. 

Maybe, they will eventually get their ducks in a row, like Jun's. Until then, it's hard to justify going back."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back next time I visit Vegas. I'm already craving it again! Complimentary creamy chicken soup was delicious and great proportions. Bulgogi plates came steaming and the owner kept checking up on us, and was so warm and welcoming. Everything is so fresh and made to order. Try the fried dumplings!"}
{"text":"Really good food and super friendly owners.  It's a true mom n pop store, owned and operated by mom n pop themselves, so if it's busy then it's understandable if the wait is a little bit longer.  But the food is true Korean home cooking and is worth any wait!  They even brought us complimentary items from their menu, as if you were a guest at your Aunt's or Uncle's house and they are encouraging you to eat some home cooked food.  Comfort food that you don't feel guilty eating.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Freshly cooked meal with a lot of side dish freebies.  Very warm husband and wife business.  Had the Beef Bulgogi and added bonus of chap chai"}
{"text":"Great food! We're vegetarian and gluten free so this can be difficult at times for Asian but not here. Atmosphere is stark, so if your expecting this complete dining experience with atmosphere don't come here. If you want authentic, healthy Korean food this is your spot. We visited Xmas eve and we were fed and served like emperors. Non stop kimchi (probably had fish sauce), seaweed salad and other dishes such as Korean omelette. All made vegetarian which can difficult for many Korean restaurants. We were also served ginger honey tea as our meal wrapped up for the two adults. My children stuffed their faces with Korean rolls. The owners were excellent conversationalist had made us feel welcome as if we were visiting their home. Prices were very reasonable and I tipped more than usual because of the amount of food that kept coming. It's a can't miss."}
{"text":"GREATEST FOOD EVER!  This place is definitely one of the best place I have eaten in my life with no exaggeration. Let's put it this way, when our food came out the pop of the mom and pop shop Mr. Lee says, \"If you enjoy our food please eat more. We will bring you more with no extra charge!\" How can anyone beat that? 

We ordered a bi bim bap which came out in a sizzling hot bowl and the Koran savory pancakes. Both home cooked, delicious and full of sides. Then as we were eating, Mrs. Lee brought us an order of jap chae Korean stir fry noodles. FOR FREE! with the soup before and the ginger tea after we were stuffed and were tempted, but couldn't take Mr. Lee up on his original offer. 

Literally some of the best food I have ever had. I will make it a point to go here every time I visit Vegas. If I could give them six stars I would."}
{"text":"We've driven past here soooo many times (in Trader Joes parking lot) and have always talked about how we need to try it.  Today was the day!  
The restaurant always appears to be not very busy when we drive by so we didn't know what to expect.  
I can tell you now that we're kicking ourselves for not trying it sooner.  This place is FABULOUS!!!  
From the moment we stepped in the door,  we were tickled by how adorable the husband and wife team were.  This is their pride and joy and they make the experience way awesome with their personal touches like a complementary chicken cream soup to start and some warm digestive aid horchata-ish drink to finish.  Between we ordered bibimbap and a basic California roll to share.  Both were delicious! The owner told us that he doesn't use broken rice and you could actually really tell the difference.  He also surprised us with some fancy shrimps that he wanted us to try.  
Overall, this is quality food at a place that really feels like your in someone's home.  So much better than stepping into a local chain and they really take pride in being very clean and having the best fresh ingredients.  Go here,  this place should be packed."}
{"text":"I'd had plans to go to subway on my way home from the bank when I noticed that the sign on the sushi place had changed. I had a peek inside... clean, but a little shabby... not that that means anything - I've noticed most of my favorite places are holes in the wall with a heart of gold - and there were only two people seated inside. I was curious, I've never had the opportunity to try Korean BBQ before, and I had some time to kill so... why not?

I hopped inside. Turns out the two seated were the owners, not customers. I feel bad for interrupting their lunch but they are incredibly welcoming and encourage me to have a seat. They were so relaxed and presented themselves so well that you find yourself forgetting that you called it shabby only a moment before. The simplicity is darling, though I still think some warm coloring or decoration could really pack a huge punch instead of the stark white.

Mr. and Mrs. Lee are gracious hosts. I am offered a bowl of soup to try while I wait for my order, a cream soup that I unfortunately can't recall the name of. I agree that in the event of a lactose intolerant customer you'd be out of luck but I am no such person and I have to say it was absolutely delicious. I learn his wife does all the cooking - a revelation that makes me balk a little. I'm the sort of person who will sometimes skip breakfast because cereal in a bowl seems like too much of an ordeal, so the idea of cooking enough food to run a restaurant every day makes me want to jump off a bridge.

She's a good sport, though. Everything is beautifully plated and the flavor is amazing. Party in your mouth material. I ordered the fried dumpling lunch and they certainly didn't skimp out on it. The dumplings were plump and more flavorful than some gyoza I've had, and came with a delicious sauce to dip them in. Sometimes dipping sauces are sort of a case of \"YOU DON'T LIKE IT SO DROWN IT IN WHATEVER THE HECK THIS IS\" but the sauce was absolutely complimentary and wasn't overpowering.

My meal also came with a number of bowls with many tasty things to try - an omelette thing that was super light and fluffy, some amazing kimchi that had all the flavor without the gastrointestinal unfriendliness that some tend to have, some cucumber salad that really needed to just be it's own meal because I could eat that forever, a bowl of rice ((of course)), and a brown... thing that I don't recognize but was really tasty and was very light. I was incredibly impressed with how fresh and light everything was. I love Chinese food but I hate feeling like I'm carrying it around with me all day - that kind of \"you're almost wearing it\" sensation that all the oils tend to leave behind - so this also satisfied the craving without making me feel gross afterward. ((I'm a korean-food newb, guys, don't judge me. ;)))

About halfway through my meal Mr. Lee returned with yet another flavor to try. A beef and noodle sample that he suggested I pair with my rice and see if I liked it. It was amazing - yet another thing that I could have just eaten all by itself. He seemed super concerned that he hadn't given me enough food and even offered to bring me something else but I laughed and told him I was fine. I know I'm a little pudgy ((okay, maybe a lot of pudgy)) but while I wasn't stuffed it was more than enough food and I was quite satisfied by the end.

I am enamored. I'll have to come by again and try some other food. Apparently they have a whole other menu for dinner? I might have to give that a try.

I'm not much of a drinker so the lack of alcohol didn't much affect me. There is a Lee's liquor within walking distance, though, and both the corner market and the smoke shop have something to get you buzzed if that's really you're thing. I did, however, find myself wanting for some hot tea but they only serve cold canned/bottled beverages.

Really my only major disappointment is that there weren't more people in there enjoying their hospitality with me. They certainly deserve more guests. I did read that on busy nights the work is a bit of an overload for poor Mrs. Lee ((and I totally don't blame her there, especially given my predisposition toward cooking)) but in the afternoon it was very quiet if you're looking for a perfect time to visit.

Happy munch'n yelpers. I hope this was helpful. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place,looks like a total dump (don't let that scare you) but it's a must if you like Korean food.Family run and everything from scratch homemade....Nicest owners ever!"}
{"text":"Good food made fresh. Don't let the simplicity of their decorations fool you. You get quality and value with every bite. The owners are health conscious and pass that onto their customers. The japchae is full of veggies and the best I've ever had. The ginger honey tea is a great end to the meal."}
{"text":"I have read some good review from this restaurant.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here on Monday 7/27.  We ordered spicy pork bulgogi roll, Korean bbq ribs ($18.50), seafood tofu soup ($10.00) and Korean roll.  All the food was just below average and not cheap at all.  I have much better Korean food from other place. This restaurant is husband & wife team only.  No server during the dinner hour.  You have waited for a long time for your food to come to the table.  No service at all and restaurant is NOT Clean.

My experience at this restaurant was bad and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"My oh my!! Ive been eating everywhere but never thought of writing reviews but this place just made me do it!! This place is family owned. The actual owner and his wife serves and cooks the food for you.. Food here is very authentic and they are sooo sooo sooo nice. The owner gave us 3 free dishes plus free desserts to try on top of our orders!! We ordered a GALBI- deliciously marinated and there is plenty of meat in it unlike the other places where its mostly bones. TOFU SOUP WITH SEAFOOD- another lovely dish, the base is not too spicy you can taste the silky tofu and the rich egg you put in it, the seafood is the best choice for this soup. BIBIM BAP- what i like about this dish is the rice is not hard at the bottom, they serve it to you right away and the vegetables in it has a pretty good seasoning. Its best to eat with the spicy sauce that came with it seperately! The free dishes he msde us try was the KOREAN PANCAKE- its good, pretty crispy on the outside and moist inside. It comes with a soysauce but i like dipping it in the spicy sauce that came with the bibimbap! SALMON- very moist!! Well seasoned and the spicy sauce is really good! I finished it in a minute, it was that good!lol JAPCHE-W0W! This place has the most delicious japche ive ever had and ive had a lot!! The noodles and vege and beef is oh sooo good, the seasoning is spot on, this is one of our favorites and will be ordering next time for sure! The dessert he gave us was i believe is called sheike? I dunno he said its a very cold fermented rice! I liked it so much that my son gave me half of his cup! Lol. Over all you should def try this place. Its a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Omg this little place is delish! It's a ma and pop shop. The owners are so super nice and the cooking is so yummy. It's a small restaurant but with home style cooking. Definitely a must try if u are in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing quality of food, pleasant environment, and amazing customer service planning to come back next week"}
{"text":"Incredible authentic Korean food in a small but warm and inviting restaurant.  No MSG, no sugar, nothing frozen - it is all freshly prepared and when you taste it, it is obvious.  This is a small place and the food comes out slowly, but I guarantee it is worth the wait - prepare to have a leisurely meal, not a fast take-out experience.  Not much on atmosphere, but people who come here know it is all about the food.  The owners are a friendly couple that sincerely care about their customers.  I would recommend the bibimbap, the fried dumplings, and the bulgogi.  The Korean pancakes were superb with great flavoring.  The sauces were full and spicy.  I will definitely come back - the food here reminds me of my Mom's Korean cooking."}
{"text":"Review is a little late. We ate here for lunch last weekend. Great little spot!  

First off, if you dine in you get  a complimentary bowl of soup. So delicious!
The place is run by husband and wife team. I love it!  Owner has such passion for the food. Everything is made from scratch and so freshly made to order. They made sure we were doing good and had enough food.  He even offered us other items from their menu so we could try and see the quality of his food. It felt like eating at your parent's home. Definitely will be back.!!!"}
{"text":"As a Korea born Korean and someone who lives close to K-town in LA, I didn't expect much when we stopped by this place near Vegas. After the first bite of oisobaeggi (cucumber kimchi), I knew something was different at this place. I had modeum-jeon lunch special, and my husbad and kids got kimbab and other things. They were all fresh, hot and good. I didn't expect that they would make those jeons fresh, since I know those are one of the hardest Korean dishes to make at a restaurant. You can definitely feel like eating at home with your mom's cooking. On top of everything,  the owners are a very nice couple who seemed to just enjoy serving you good Korean foods. Highly recommend anyone to stop by."}
{"text":"This local mom and pop spot boasts some incredible home-made style meals.  If you are looking for a super sweet, super salty meal, look elsewhere. I routinely have cravings for home-style Korean food, and I am supremely happy to have found this gem tucked into the corner of the Trader Joes center. No MSG, no preservatives, all made to order goodness. Definitely the best soft tofu (soondooboo) in the entire Las Vegas valley. Did I also mention all house-made side dishes (including kimchi) ?! Also house-made Korean dessert drink (shik hae). I have been here once a week, and I couldn't be happier that Las Vegas finally has good, authentic Korean food. 

A tip: there are literally only two people that own this place.  During busy hours, it takes a while to serve the food, since everything is cooked to order."}
{"text":"Amazing food and extremely authentic!  After having not been in Korea for 5 years, this was so what I needed to get my fix.  Owners/operators were extremely friendly and took excellent care of us.  If your looking for the real deal and not chain type or Americanized, you have to eat here."}
{"text":"good food. proprietor dissed a potential customer."}
{"text":"Nice mom and Pops restaurant. The food is very tasty. Portions are good. Very very nice people. They gave a compliment Japchae dish."}
{"text":"their food is amazing and i love the mom and pop atmosphere. it was my first time experiencing korean food so they made it my great first time. he's a kind and generous man and the woman's cooking was splendid. his generosity was by far the best i've experienced for a dining experience and the food is amazingly priced!"}
{"text":"Lee, very sad to see you closed!!
Best Korean food around!!
I hope you are well,
Randy"}
{"text":"Venue is kind of small but the service and the food definitely make up for it. As a Korean-american I have had my share of authentic Korean food. Everything served was pretty spot on. My mom ordered the Kalbi. The meat was delicious and of great quality. 

Not to mention the price of Kalbi (for the portion given) is usually at least a few more dollars more at other Korean restaurants. Therefore, you really are getting the \"bang for your buck\".

Mr. Lee and his wife were very nice and professional. I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great little surprise. Everything was delicious. Mr. Lee was such a wonderful host. My only complaint is he wouldn't stop bringing out little appetizers to try! I'm stuffed. But I feel good. Healthy food, great people."}
{"text":"Sadly, Mr. Lee informed me today that they will be closing permanently sometime in April :(
I will be sure to eat here many more times before Korean BBQ & Rolls closes its doors forever. 
I recommend the Spicy Pork Bulgogi---tastes even better than my grandma's cooking!"}
{"text":"Located next to trader Joes, it's a small restaurant previously called M sushi. The older Korean couple took over the place and haven't yet to fully decorate over the old decors. The place looks a bit clumsy, and not really pleasant looking, but don't let that influence your palette. This place has great food. 

Their menu is clean. Easy to see, nothing clustering what food you should get. Relatively small menu, but most are the staple of Korean cooking. I grew up eating Korean cuisine in Korea. Nothing I found in this town compares to my mother and my grandmother's Korean food, but this place has it great. The owners are friendly, and according to the owner, it's his wife that does most of the cooking. Ordered a few things with my fiance. Their soft tofu soup has a LOT of tofu compared to other places I've been to, and the taste is phenomenal."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed my favorite mom and pop Korean restaurant? This place is pretty simple as in decor and menu items. This means ( at least from my experiences) they do what they know and do it right. They are always nice and treat you like an old friend. Don't be surprised to get a free soda or some other offering free of charge. They're giving and it shows in their food too. In both quality and preparation. They always give ban chan with every meal, about 5 or 6 different types sometimes more depending on what you order.  Salted plums are sooooo good! I hope nothing but a long great future for this place."}
{"text":"Re-donk-ulous!  Expect to wait, it's a two man (well, one couple actually) operation.  Husband is the front of the house and is charming. Wife is a brilliant chef. She gets all scientific on home-cooked traditional Korean dishes (seriously, hubby showed me her scientific notebook full of recipe tweaks).  Definitely my new favorite Korean restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and well worth the drive if you don't live nearby.

The food was absolutely great, I had the bulgogi with the sides that accompanied it. While eating, we were offered free samples of some of the other great food simply to get a taste for it. Can't guarantee this happens every time to everyone, but I thought it was a great and friendly gesture!"}
{"text":"I felt as if we had been invited into their own home for an elaborate feast. The kindness and thoughtfulness of the owners made us feel like honored guests, and the food was incredible, every bite astounding! The plate presentation was beautiful, and both owners were attentive when our sides or rice appeared low. Don't rush your meal here, just sit back and enjoy the plentiful food and hospitality."}
{"text":"This is like a hole in a wall resto and you'll be surprised at how good the food tasted!  We had Galbi which was so tasty, a dragon roll that was to die for!  The Unagi and avocado combination was so creamy, we loved it!  Mr Lee was sooooo accommodating and friendly!  He even had sides and a cold soup  dessert.  Thanks, Mr and Mrs Lee for a wonderful eating experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant today, Friday for the first time since they're in our neighborhood.  We came in an hour before they close at 8pm. The owner told us respectfully that they're not serving anymore because they ran out of rice and other things in their menu. Too bad for a first timer! I'm not rating them on how their food taste, but on how they had enough to serve until they close!

We came back early next day and was greeted by Mr. Lee and found out him and his wife were one of the most hospitable people we've ever met. We ordered galbi, mo deum jeum (a side dish), and dragon rolls, cream soup as starter,  and some sort of a cold rice  drink. 

Well, I have to say, these couple makes the best korean dishes I ever tasted especially the rolls!!! They always ask us what we need and even served us delicious stir fry noodles for free. 

If your looking for good and healthy Korean food, this is the place to go. Simple and friendly atmosphere! 

Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Lee"}
{"text":"Best authentic Korean food I've ever had! Owners are genuinely concerned about providing the best food and experience to their customers. Don't let the bland restaurant walls dissuade you from going in, the food and the great service makes up for that! I told the owner my mom would love their food, he made his wife cook a small serving of stir-fried noodles for me to take home to my mom for free! Who does that anymore?!

They used prime quality ingredients and everything was cooked to order so be patient if it takes a bit to prepare and serve. The wait is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"First time in LV, really good korean food! They also have lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I loved that this place was like stepping into a family dining room. The couple that runs the place is so sweet, kind, and hard working. The food took awhile to order and come out as everything is made fresh daily. Options were limited on their menu due to the lunch rush and that was disappointing, but everything was pretty tasty. I wish they had more help to speed up the service and keep up with demand so that all menu items are available to each customer coming in and you don't have to wait so very long for service. Aside from that I enjoyed our visit. Just don't go in hungry! It's more of a leisurely food journey than a restaurant dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The best thing on the menu is definitely the Korean short ribs. It's so tender and full of flavor. Since this place is close to my home, I come here quite often. This restaurant is run by Mr. Lee and his wife and it gives off a mom and pop feeling when you walk in. All the meals come with complimentary soup, rice, Korean appetizers, and a rice drink dessert. Mr. Lee even throws in a free Korean pan fried noodle whenever I go. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I literally just sat down and I already love the food and service. Truly homemade flavor. Just moved to Las Vegas and I'm so happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Love the couples here they are really nice and cute. And the food are authentic! I have been here several times~ Like kimchi fried rice"}
{"text":"Love this place! No msg and all home prepped! Mom and pop shop! I'm Korean and this brings me home! The owners are so sweet! I'll be coming back soon!

They care about your health by having everything fresh clean and hand picked! She makes the kimchi as a well! They're hardworking owners starting from 5 am to midnight everyday making sure they have what it takes for the next day! They served us complimentary dishes that were excellent! 

I recommend going here for Korean! Quality! Clean! Home feel! Good portions! Reasonable pricing!"}
{"text":"Best tasting korean side dishes I've had yet.  Very friendly and welcoming owners.  Will make  sure  to come back next time I'm in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Really authentic and cheap Korean food, lovely hosts who are very very friendly and personal. Best choice in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with few tables.  It has very minimal decoration but serving a very delicious authentic Korean food.  

We visited them on the Thanksgiving afternoon. We were confused since the shop sign showed \" M Sushi\" on one side and \"Korean BBQ\" on the other side.  However, it is the same place.  It run by a couple of kind senior  couples like the others say- they made you feel like home.

We ordered a pork bulgolgi and a Korean pancake.  The first served us a complimentary soup which was a very delicious surprise.  Then followed by set of pickles, kimchi, spouts and our dishes.  Then another surprise came, they brought us a jap-shae ( Korean noodle).  All dishes were authentic and very delicious.  We were really full and they brought us some sweet ginger tea to finish our meal.  We were asked all the time whether we had enough food.  We felt like we were visiting a senior relative and were given a big feast.  Their hospitality truly warm and welcome.  I were so grateful and felt like going back home.  

If you are looking for a basic good time, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Mr. and Mrs. Lee invited us and some friends over for dinner. They prepared a fantastic spread of Korean delights. We couldn't have asked for a tastier dinner or more gracious hosts. 

OK, so that's not actually true. Prior to walking into Korean BBQ & Rolls, we had never met the Lee's. They are the fantastic duo that run this quaint restaurant. We met friends for dinner; we were the only diners so we did feel like guests in their home. The dining room is a bit stark, but Mr. Lee exudes all the warmth the space needs. While Mrs. Lee works magic in the kitchen. The simplicity of it is incredibly charming. 

We eagerly delved into the menu, but Mr. Lee encouraged us to begin with comforting creamy chicken soup before it got cold. He offered a second helping, but when we all refused it packed it up to send home with us. We excitedly ordered a slew of food, it all sounded so good. Mr. Lee repeatedly said, \"It was too much\". He was worried we'd waste our money. There was no need for concern. We were happy to stuff ourselves silly.

Though, our eyes were a bit bigger than our stomach. Especially with additions the Lee's kindly sprung on us and the banchan. Still, we did our best, and made a heavy dent in our feast. 

The Kimchi fried rice ($9) was loaded with bold flavor and extremely addictive. The Japchae ($8.50) was one of the items Mr. Lee chose for us. This Korean dish has tender stir fried noodles and fresh veggies in a sweet and savory sauce. The Pork Bulgogi roll ($8.50) was tasty, but also my least favorite item. However, those who are squeamish about raw sushi rolls just might enjoy this twist. Mo Deum Jeon ($10.50) was a another treat the Lee's whipped up. The shrimp is served with the collar, the variety of pancakes are scrumptious with crab, white fish and meatball patties. And finally, the Galbi ($18.50) and Bulgogi ($15.50). Both were served sizzling hot and perfectly marinated. We all agreed the Galbi stole the show. Excellent! To finish, we were treated to Sikhye, a sweet rice drink that is known to help with digestion.

I adore mom and pop restaurants. There are too few in Las Vegas, but those that exist are real gems. Korean BBQ & Rolls is no exception. Don't come rushed, take the time to get to know Mr. & Mrs. Lee. You might need to serve yourself and you will need to ask for the check, but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The couple running the restaurant are very friendly and sweet. If you think the food is alright, it's definitely worth the trip to visit these folks and receive their warm welcomes.

I ordered the kalbi short ribs and they came out in great portions. I have no complaints on the quality of the meat. They were tender and easy to chew through. The flavor was just right. Their rice is also steamed to perfection (something that is difficult to find in Henderson) and complemented the kalbi well.

The service is a little slow because it's just 2 people running the restaurant, but they're so nice to you that it becomes an after thought. It's a great family-friendly restaurant to pass time at, and an overall positive experience.

I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good Korean food."}
{"text":"Just went today with my sister after reading reviews in yelp and it was worth it. Quaint little hole in the wall place, only ran by an older Korean couple who have great customer service and manners, the food was delicious, all made fresh so be patient after all was said and done I could barely finish the Korean rice tea he offered at the end because I was so full. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Forget going to Spring Mountain for great Korean food. I've been there and never found it. Now, this fairly new place in Henderson, on the corner of Green Valley and Sunset, has what I've been looking for. This is truly delicious Korean food that almost tastes as if you're eating a meal in a Korean family's home that has an excellent cook. The kalbi was cooked to perfection and came delivered on a hot iron plate sizzling hot. They served very generous portions that I had to take some home. The meat was juicy, cooked medium, and pretty thick. Everything else I ate was delicious and of high quality. I could tell the kimchi and other pickled vegetables were fresh. The Korean pancakes were also so good, along with cream chicken soup, that started the meal. Then, at the end, they served this rice type of drink, called Sikhye. This was something new to me, and I loved it.  So the food was a huge plus, but the owners were so friendly that you felt very welcome there. The husband gave me a free bottle of water, and kept making sure if I if I needed refills on any of the food, which is unusual for a restaurant. This is just a mom-and-pop, husband-and-wife operation. He mentioned that when it's busy that some people get upset if the food takes longer than normal. However, this doesn't bother me because I understand it's a tiny operation and the quality of food that's cooked to order is worth the wait. The husband and I had a good conversation about his background and other things. He's a kind man (along with his wife who I didn't get to talk to much she was because she was busy cooking) and is so happy to have you as a customer to enjoy some Korean culture. I'll definitely be back to get my fix of Korean food."}
{"text":"Just moved from San Diego to Vegas and was hoping I'd find delicious Korean food comparable to the ones I've had in Cali... luckily, we came across this little hole in the wall restaurant!  The husband-wife team are absolutely amazing, friendly, and hospitable... by far the best service I've had anywhere!

We swung by around dinner and were promptly greeted (we were even given the remote to switch channels on the tv if we wanted).  We were then served on-the-house cream of chicken (?) soup  while we waited for our order of kimbap, bibimbap, and  soon doo bu.  When our food was ready, we were also given banchan that they nicely refilled when we ran out as well as complimentary japchae on the side. To finish the meal, we were given the chilled rice drink... yummy!

Learned a lot about the owners during our little feast (they came from CA, too) and am glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Food was worth the wait.  Owner was very polite and personal.  They suggested our entire menu and we LOVED it.  

We will be back.  Thank you for your hospitality."}
{"text":"What a completely unexpected surprise!  My colleague and I were looking for a new spot to grab lunch and felt like some Korean. We previously though that Jun's was the only location near the office and grew weary of them since they raised their prices with very little to show for it. I yelped Korean and to my surprise, a new entry showed up i hadn't noticed before.  The place itself is rather unassuming and in-fact, it's hard to tell there's a Korean restaurant there at all - the sign outside still says \"M SUSHI\". 

Well, all I can say is we were both thanking the lucky stars we decided to try this place. It felt like having a home cooked meal at my grandparents house. The couple that own this new spot are very hospitable and they take great pride in their cooking.We had an order of the Spicy Pork Bulgogi and Spicy Chicken, and both are excellent choices. The owner and his wife treated us to some complimentary soup, pot stickers and a dessert drink. Everything was delish. Try this out and go local. You won't regret it - I know we'll be back to try out more of their dishes and bringing along some more of our co-workers too."}
{"text":"Me & my boyfriend enjoy their food. The food is very authentic and the owners are such a character. You'll never regret the food there :)"}
{"text":"This hidden restaurant is a great eat! Outstanding Korean food and a very generous couple running the place. My girlfriend and I had dinner here and ordered the kalbi and bee bim bop. The kalbi was perfectly marinated, something I've never had in Las Vegas. The bee bim bop was excellent as well. Mr Lee also brought us out soup, chop chey, and drinks for no charge at all. I will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love small family businesses? This is the american dream, right? Be your own boss, do what you love.

This is exactly what is going on here. Husband and wife are absolutely adorable and lovable. You walk in and they each great you with huge smiles, he explains every item and the food is authentic. It taste amazing and you truly feel like you are in their home. Nothing beats that. 

Don't be fooled by the M Sushi sign outside though."}
{"text":"The best korean restaurant I have been. Everything we ordered were so delicious and tasteful. The guy who served us is very hospitable, felt like were guests on their home. There are no other server , only him. Wife is the one cooking. Everything tastes new like straight from the pan. 

I never knew you could make rolls with beef. Bolgogi rolls were good. Stir fried Noodles with vegetables were also good. 

The place is neat and clean. 

I will definitely come back here. Hopefully business will grow because this is a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and it was awesome.   I wanted to have a great lunch and read the reviews here on Yelp as always.  So I anticipated a wait while Mom and Pop made the amazing meal of which I was not disappointed, it was so tasty !  I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"What a find in Henderson. On the way to the airport and Yelp lead us to a great mom and pop restaurant. The reviews do not lie!

Be sure to come hungry and the food keeps coming out--from soup as a starter to a dessert drink to finish the meal. 

I will bookmark this place. It's a hidden GEM of a restaurant near Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It goes to show, good manners from the host and hostess really can make or break a business..and I was definitely satisfied with my experience here! I ate at Mr. and Mrs. Lee's Korean BBQ and Rolls about 5 months ago and still remember the kind hospitality I received from such a small mom and pop restaurant. The name (M Sushi back then) was misleading at first, so I'm glad it's now called \"Korean BBQ and Rolls.\" 

The food was on par with home-cooked  Korean favorites, such as galbi, soon tofu, and bulgolgi. Everything was flavorful and just the perfect amount of spiciness, especially the soups. The galbi could use a bit more char, but most non-Asians might confuse this for burnt food. The portions are not too big or too small, and prices are competitive with other small businesses in the area. This is a great alternative if you live in the suburbs of Henderson and do not trek out to Spring Mountain.

This place is best for take- out as seating is limited and there is not much to look at inside the shop. Love the couple that runs this business though...I can taste the passion and love in their food!"}
{"text":"Been here several times with the family.  The Korean food is very fresh and very authentic.  Mr. Lee is the owner and he works with his wife.  They both make us feel like we are part of the family.  Like to give us soup and dished off the menu to let us try.  Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"I want to start off saying the service is excellent! The owner was so friendly and funny. While the place may look a little dull and outdated from outside, the food is on point. The owner told me he only uses fresh ingredients because he wants to provide better taste rather than making money off it (rare business model). Food is delicious and I will sure to be back soon."}
{"text":"2nd time here and I have just been notified this will be closing in April. . Absolutely  dollar for dollar 100% the best Korean food I have ever had. hole in the wall.
Hope you have a chance to get here before it's to late. 
retiring."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, we loved it..Customer service is amazing. place is clean . The food is very delish, my hubby loved the Galbi.  They also gave us pan fried noodles for free to try;)"}
{"text":"I love the food, the place, and the customer service. I've been looking for a good Korean restaurant for quite some time. It seems I found what I have been looking for. The owners are really hospitable and thoughtful. After our meal, we were given a tea that can help with digestion as stated by the owner. At first I thought its a kind of tea that tastes like medicine. It looks like it but No! It freakin' tastes good! I would've asked for more if I wasn't that full. Its also cute how the owner talks so fondly and jokingly about his wife who by the way is the chef. I would definitely go back to this place and invite a couple of friends next time."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.  Tasty and plentiful.  Very kind family service.  I wish it were busier, they are in the mood to cook!  They keep bringing things out and I'm just stuffed.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The couple working there diligently worked to get all the food items that we ordered. (We ordered a lot and I felt really bad because it's just the two of them) The food was great and they were very welcoming. My favorite was the galbi and bulgogi!"}
{"text":"The food here was good! We has kimchee fried rice, & bulgogi. Delicious!!!! The service was awesome. It's an old school mom n pop shop."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this one star. I went in tonight to try to order something to go and I was told by the husband and wife team there that they couldn't serve me because there was one table full of people. Seriously? You're a restaurant. Your livelihood depends on serving people food. Maybe you should hire someone else to help you during dinner time if you can't handle 10 people on your own. 

I had never eaten here before and I was hoping to give it a try since it was so close to my house but I will NEVER set foot in this place again. I can't for the life of me figure out how they're in business."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the worker (I think the owner) was really nice and attentive. I had the fried white fish lunch special which was perfectly cooked. My friend had short ribs, bulgogi roll, and shrimp tempura roll. Bulgogi doesn't work so well in a sushi roll but the rest of the food was great."}
{"text":"Seriously, the BEST Korean BBQ around! I have told practically EVERYONE I know so I thought I would take to Yelp to tell all my fellow Yelpers! This is definitely somewhere I would take my Real Estate Clients to celebrate closing escrow!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!   Wow! Straight authenticity.  After four tours to Korea it's like this little restaurant fell out of Korea itself. 
This is the real deal! I can't tell you much I like Adashee and Ajeema!!!
They bring you extra appetizers and half an entrée just so you can try it whatever you want mentality.  They make you happy and excellent service.  
Offer Ginger honey tea for dessert!  
It's awesome!
I'll be back for sure!!!  Neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"Family restaurant with a nice Korean couple running it.   Food is served like I it was outside the base in Korea in the army years ago."}
{"text":"The young at heart couple who operates this place is really sweet. The lunch I ordered was delicious! The price was right too! The various \"Lunch Boxes\" run between $7-9.75. Great value for a quality home cooked meal. Note: The lunch specials are available EVERY DAY 11am-2:30pm 

Yelped searched Korean BBQ, Henderson and Korean BBQ & Rolls is how I found this place. The reviews were valid and spot on. This gem has been hiding here in plain sight for almost a year now. Same address where M Sushi resides. Same strip mall with Weiss Deli, Trader Joes.

If you are expecting trendy fancy schmancy place and quasi celeb chefs, well, you'll be a little bit disappointed. This place is real simple, modestly furnished and run by a humble hardworking Korean couple who cooks up some good comfort food. Ready and eager to please. They remind me of grandpa and gramma who need a little prompting. (ie letting them know you are ready to check out)  So be patient especially if there are a few parties in the house. 

Got a warm welcome from Mr Lee. Before I even sat down, he said he was bringing out some Cream of Chicken soup that his wife made. Turned around  and off to back of the kitchen he went. So I made myself at home grabbed the two menus from the counter and picked out a table. He came back out with my drink order (No fountain drinks) and after he took my order he shouts out \"Ma!\" to his wife and passes along my order. This place is as old school home-style family run as you can get. I love it. 

Cream of Chicken soup came presented piping hot and passes the comfort food taste test with flying colors. Yum yum! 

My Galbi ribs came out sizzling hot. Literally! Sizzling on a cast iron plate!  http://instagram.com/p/uGuAEuDSAf/
Impressive! Mrs. Lee even brought it out to me.The little dishes of  banchan also came with my order.

I finished everything and was pretty full. Then Mr Lee brings out some Japche his wife made for me for me to try, then Mrs Lee came out with this dessert drink, then Mr. Lee appears with some Korean pancakes..omg...did I just say I was stuffed? LOL

I truly appreciated their hospitality and the delicious food to boot. Definitely more lunch visits to come!"}
{"text":"The Korean food was SO good. The prices were excellent. Our total was around $20 for two of us. It was the cheapest and best bulgulgi that my fiance has ever had. We also got complimentary sides such as kimchi, pickled veggies, soup, and noodles. The owners were really nice. I absolutely recommend this place for authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson and this is definitely my new favorite place to eat. The foods is delicious. It's just the husband and wife. He makes you laugh and she cooks fantastic food. It reminds me of home cooked food. There isn't much for decor, but I go to restaurants for the food. This is just a great place to go to relax, laugh, and eat more food than anyone should."}
{"text":"Came her last with my girl and didn't know they were about to close. The owners were very friendly and still took us in for dinner. The food was very authentic Korean and the owner kept offering free food making sure we had enough to eat. Very home like environment especially being away from home. I would recommend this place to anyone who love authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Hello the Food at Korean Bbq place is really  delicious  food and it's  homemade cooking. I love everything their serving at the menu."}
{"text":"Great place! Real Korean food and the owner and his wife are so kind and warm. Couldn't recommend it more! (I wrote my original review in Korean and it didn't post, oh well)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to randomly try this place last week as we had some time before a movie. The place was small and empty. The type of place I usually avoid bcs I'm always nervous if a place isn't busy. But we decided to be adventurous and try it anyways. To our absolute delight the food was amazing. The Galbi was tender and utterly delicious. At the suggestion of the owner, we ordered the stone bowl as another entree, which was another unique dish served only in a way a proud Korean could. The owner was very happy to have our business and was proud to tell us about his wife's cooking and the health benefits of spices found in Korean BBQ. We had multiple conversations with him as he dutifully served what his wife created. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. I rate it five stars for the overall satisfaction we left with, the kind you get when you've just realized you've found a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I'm am so glad they are here. The food was delicious,  I had the pork bulgogi. I got a lot for 10 dollars."}
{"text":"Excellent! It is a two person operation.  A man (Lee) and his wife; she cooks, he serves.  They are incredibly friendly, the food was all delicious, and they are also incredibly generous.  I am visiting the area for work and had a craving for some good Korean food so in my search i discovered this place.  They start by bringing a complimentary appetizer while you browse the menu.  Kim Chi and rice is also complimentary.  The menu consists of various Koren dishes and some sushi.  They even made a Korean dish (one of my favorites) by request even though it wasn't on the menu.  Throughout the meal, Lee brought seconds and thirds making sure the customers are satisfied. Excellent  service and great flavors, recommended for sure."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews, but I have to share how much I love this place. The food is great, great prices, great service. For the first time, I hate that I have a small stomach because I wanted to eat more, but physically cannot. I had the mo deum jeon, which had some of the most tender, mouth-watering fish I've ever had. The sides dishes deliciously balanced out all the flavors in the meal. The extra japchae was sooooo good and the complimentary soup was hearty yet light. I don't have enough good things to say. This place reminds me of how dining out should be: down-to-earth, delicious, and a leisure, heartfelt experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean. I can't recommend Mr. and Mrs. Lee's place enough. It's rare to find a place with owners so friendly and giving. My only regret is I'm here visting from FL and won't be able to get Korean this amazing on a regular basis when I go home."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I am missing the Korean food I grew up with. Everything is homemade. The couple that runs this place is absolutely lovely. If you are not familiar with Korean food, go here for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Just to clear the confusion up front, Korean BBQ and Rolls restaurant has taken over the location of the previous M Sushi & Roll.  Unfortunately, the sign out front still says M Sushi so hopefully folks will be able to find this place, because it is such a treat.  It's to the far right of Trader Joe's and there is plenty of strip mall parking out front.  Look for a white \"M Sushi\" sign on top and then you'll see a smaller \"Korean BBQ and Rolls\" near the entrance door.  (Mr. Lee -unsure about spelling-, the owner, indicated that he will invest in a new official sign next year depending upon how the business does.)

First, the food tastes great.  This is a mom-and-pop restaurant so you're getting home-cooked Korean meals.  The last time I was there, most of the customers spoke Korean which tells me that the food is authentic.  (There is some fusion sushi on the menu but I haven't tried it yet.)  The most balanced entree is the Galbi (marinated beef short ribs).  If you prefer sweets, then the slightly sweeter Beef Bulgogi is your best bet.  I prefer salty and spicy, so the saltier Spicy Pork Bulgogi is my choice.  The Mo Deum Jeon lunch box (assorted meat pancakes) is also delicious.  You get complimentary soup (it is like creamy mushroom soup though not sweet), four sides (I think kimchi, eggs, pickled cucumber, and another pickled unidentified veggie), and a couple of dumplings (yummy, crispy with meat-veggie center).  Those complimentary dishes may change though, because for a little while, I also got to taste a very refreshing, sweet rice drink that was made out of rice only (without any sugar added).

Second, the service is very friendly.   Mr. Lee is super accommodating.  Mrs. Lee seemed really nice though she doesn't speak much English.  They've been in business at this location just over 10 months.  Mr. Lee was retired 2 years ago, got bored, and moved to Las Vegas to start a business.  Mrs. Lee, who works mostly in the kitchen, used to work as a registered nurse so you know the food is healthy.  They try to avoid MSG and sugar.  I don't think any of the entrees have MSG.  However, if you are sensitive to MSG, ask Mr. Lee not to put the salty seasoning on the rice because my MSG-sensitive friend thought that it might contain some MSG. 

Because Mr. Lee also helps with the cooking in the kitchen, service varies from full service to self-service depending upon how many customers are present.   If there is only one or two customers in the restaurant, ask Mr. Lee for anything you need as he will be mostly at the front.   If the restaurant is fuller than that, Mr. Lee may be cooking in the kitchen with his wife, feel free to grabs things as you need them (within reason).

Important things to know to make your experience at this wonderful mom-and-pop restaurant pleasant:
1) When you arrive, choose any free table.  You can ask Mr. Lee where to sit though he would probably say anywhere.  Because the space is small, try to avoid grabbing more table than you need (like taking up two 4 person tables when you are a party of 5).   
2) Send one person to the front counter to grab one of two menus (or grab both).  There is a lunch special menu (just a folded 8x11 paper which looks like a takeout menu) and regular dinner-style menu (full 8x11 sized, plastic cover).  The lunch menu is a great bargain as prices are $7-10 for the lunch bentos.   The dinner menu has items not on the lunch menu.  The dinner menu has full price entrees which can feed two people.
3) There is no tap water drink available.  You can order the bottled water and assorted drinks (reasonably priced at $1.25) from the refrigerated drink display box to the front, left.   If Mr. Lee is particularly busy, feel free to grab the drinks from the box yourself and make sure to let Mr. Lee know when you ask for the check.  (There is a water tower dispenser to the right of the drink box, but Mr. Lee indicates that the filter hasn't been changed in a long time and not to use it.)
4) Get Mr. Lee's attention when you are ready to order.
5) The rice bowl comes with a salty, seaweed seasoning on top.  You can ask to not have the seasoning if you don't like salt.  Otherwise, make sure to mix the rice with the seasoning before eating.  Ask for more rice and side dish refills (no extra charge) if you need more.
6) To pay for your meal, either ask Mr. Lee for the check or go to the front counter.   It's all very informal.

I hope that you will visit this cool mom-and-pop restaurant.  I like the food and the owners there, so I want Mr. and Mrs. Lee to do well and stay in business."}
{"text":"WOW! What a gem. Mr. and Mrs. Lee are outstanding and have the perfect mix of great food and great personality. As soon as we sat down, we were given the creamy chicken soup and asked what we would like to drink. That soup made me feel right at home. Mrs. Lee rushed back to the kitchen and started preparing all manor of delightful things for us to try! Mr. Lee suggested the ribs and kimchee and we ordered the fried rice and japchea, all excellent! And that sweet rice drink after the meal was heavenly. We are in love with Korean BBQ & Rolls and with Mr. & Mrs. Lee. Lunch specials and dinner menu are a great price. I don't know if they cater but I would certainly want them to!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Korean food! Owned by a lovely older Korean couple. We got a complimentary appetizer (homemade soup) and dessert rice drink."}
{"text":"We've dined here for dinner on several occasions now. These four stars are given with a caveat. This is a little mom-and-pop restaurant with a couple of quirks that may or may not turn your own dining experience into an uncomfortable one.

First off, the food is delicious. It is well-prepared and fresh. The \"mom\" of the couple does a fantastic job with the food preparation.

The \"pop\" of the couple is VERY friendly. VEEERRRYY friendly. At first this turned us off a bit. We appreciate friendliness, but it bordered on intrusive. BUT, if you can get used to it (it is all well intended) your experience will be a good one.

They will likely bring extra food to you that you haven't requested. This made us feel guilty at first since we were full and couldn't eat it, but we've come to just accept it and take it home for later.

So, definitely worth it for the great food. Just be prepared to feel like you're visiting an extremely overly indulgent aunt and uncle that happen to be Korean."}
{"text":"This place is now on my dream team restaurant list. Make sure you find a way to get here. The food is amazing. Nothing but homemade and quality. We traveled to LV from DC and eat a very clean diet. After a week of various restaurants, my stomach was wondering what was going on (and many of them very expensive meals). It is now happy after eating at K BBQ and rolls. I feel like we were adopted by the owners. It was so important to them that we had a wonderful meal. They certainly delivered."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch while traveling and on our way to the airport.  This is KOREAN BBQ I've been craving.   Thank you so much.  Chicken cream soup was good.  It just comes from the owner.  Flank beef #15 was perfect (on the lunch menu).  We got an extra side from the owner just because and a rice drink for dessert just appeared as well.

Stop in locals you have a hidden gem that I wish I had in CO.  Owners are incredibly nice!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I tried to go back the other day and call in my order for takeout, and they said they were completely out of food (at 7pm?)"}
{"text":"As a Korean American living 15 minutes away from Koreatown LA, I throughly enjoyed our lunch.  The Korean dishes are made from high quality ingredients and prepared meticulously by the owner.  Her husband how she is dedicated in making these comfort food the right way, not by reheating them, etc.  We ended up taking extra plates home and had it the next day."}
{"text":"Good food.  The steamed dumplings were great and we enjoyed the spicy pork.  They also carry a small sushi menu which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great service. We felt like we were eating dinner at the Lee household as Mr & Mrs Lee served up complimentary soup to start off the meal. Dumplings were fantastic and you could tell they were handmade from pastry to filling. Will definitely come back to this place again."}
{"text":"A group of us (4 adults, 1 three year old) went there for dinner to give it a try based upon Yelp Reviews.  And Yelpers . . .you didn't disappoint us.

The husband/wife owners treat you like you're family.  Probably even better than most people treat their own relatives.

The food was tasty and quite reasonable.  In fact, when we finished our dishes, they came out and asked us if you would like more . . .without any additional charge.

They really catered to my 3 year old and gave her some special treats (they of course asked 1st before they gave her anything).

This is a place to go if you're not in a hurry as there is no rush to move you thru and make room for the next customer. . ..which is nice is today's dinner world. . . .it just might catch you off guard if you're not expecting it.

I would recommend that you don't wait until closing time to order as they may run out of some dishes.  We went at 6 on a Sunday and they ran out of food by 7 and were still open until 8.  There were several customers that were turned away.

To me this is a good sign.  That means people really like the place and eat all the food.  It also means that the ingredients are fresh as there isn't much leftover for the next day.  I would rather take my chances of running out of food and having the fresh ingredients.

We definitely will be back!!  Thank you again for your hospitality!!"}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say that I am Korean, so I have a very discriminating palate when it comes to the food.

I've gone to many Korean restaurants in town and still haven't found anything phenomenal, but most are not bad.  This place was mediocre with respect to the flavor of food, but the service was excellent. The adashi and ajuma who run this place are very kind and hospitable.  It is located in Green Valley on the corner of the Trader Joe's shopping center.  The sign has a different name though from the past asian joint.

My husband and I decided to try this spot over our usual because it is a tad closer to us. The menu is very simple and each dish runs roughly $8. I was a little confused because they are set up as lunch and dinner dishes; however, some are more like appetizers. I ordered kalbi and my husband ordered a mix of korean pancake, battered fish and meat patties. It took a bit to get our food and we were the only people in the place, but adashi (older gentleman) offered us a soup appetizer and also jap chae. The soup was a tad bland, but the jap chae was delicious. When our main meals arrived, the presentation was nice. The kalbi was served on a hot stone and smelled scrumptious. I like some fat on my kalbi because it tastes better to me, but this dish was full of very hard fat, so it wasn't appetizing, sadly. I believe it is because the meat quality was lacking. My husband's lunch plate was less than stellar. The pancake was ok, but the fish was soggy and the meat patties were undercooked. I think the meat patties would have been delicious though had they been cooked fully.  

As for the banchan, it was very sour. I actually prefer my kimchi when it starts to sour, but this was too far gone. Too much for restaurant serving purposes in my opinion. They should rotate it more often or make less of it at one time to help keep it fresh. The kimchi was definitely at the point of making jigae and very sour jigae at that. For Americans who don't know kimchi, I think it would scare them away from trying it again. It isn't a good representation of kimchi in the least.

Sadly, we won't return simply because Jun's on eastern is much better quality for the same/similar price and offers a large assortment of fresh banchan. The owners are super nice though!"}
{"text":"This was the best customer service I have received in a really long time. The husband and wife owners are the servers and chefs; they were incredibly kind and brought us a sample dish on the house, as well as tea and an appetizer we were not expecting. 

The atmosphere is really basic, just your typical strip mall divey place, but don't let that fool you. The food is amazing! So many great options were available and everything we tried (6 dishes in all) was just so crazy good. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We walked in and were totally ignored for 5 minutes standing there.  Finally one guy said it would be 40-50 minutes.  There were no clean tables so we stood until someone left with a to-go order.  We waited another 5 minutes and when no one said anything at all to us we left.  The food had looked good on the menu we grabbed.  But the service was lacking."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers! Another success at great food sighting!! This seemingly simple mom and pops korean shop has the familiarity of home comfort food. 

We came for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. Only two korean couple were working. The place is small but clean and inviting. The lady brought us soup before we put in our order. It a lighter version of creamy veggie soup, delicious! We ordered some bulgolgi and to my surprise the portion is very big for under 10 dollars! 

Service was incredible, we were asked many times on if we need more drinks/side dishes(free). Since it was our first time they gave us some extra dish and had small talks with us about where we were from etc. 

All in all a great experience! Would rate it 6 stars if possible. Recommend it to anyone that likes korean food!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good mom and pop joints (and this place is exactly that. If you can overlook the dingy decor, this place has everything (well except alcohol) you would want - friendly service from the owners themselves who obviously cares a lot about the food they serve you. While the menu is fairly standard, the execution is superb and everything we had (Gim bap, bibimbap, sundubu) tasted balanced, flavorful, CLEAN, and obviously executed by someone with decades of experience in a real korean kitchen.  The free desert drink at the end is a nice touch and I would drive to Henderson just for that   

Now if they can only upgrade the decor and create a warmer environment to dine in I would give them five stars."}
{"text":"This is a gem for the Henderson area! Husband and wife run their little restaurant. Customer service is above reproach. Mr. Lee is attentive and very polite. 
Food is awesome! Its a small menu but what you get tastes great!
I try and go once a week just for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been wanting some Korean food and I came across this place when my husband went to the sports store next door. The old guy who helped me seemed very friendly. He explained to me about their menu. I ordered the bulgogi lunch and they came out delicious. Even my son liked it. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Quaint. Clean. Delicious! 
I'm an American who is particular about Korean food.   This is the best Korean in the area. The older gentleman and his wife are charming. I can't wait to be back in the area to enjoy the bulgogi and dumplings again!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We are visiting from Fresno and the overall experience was great.  The meal was fabulous and the service awesome.  The owners were great people.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rare to be treated so well. Great Food great people. Highly recommended.fresh food and very tasty"}
{"text":"It used to be M Sushi & Roll and was an AYCE sushi bar and it did close for awhile but it is now owned by Mr. and Mrs. Lee, a wonderful older couple from Korea. They left the name M Sushi on the sign kept some of the pictures that were on the walls inside but they now serve mostly Korean home cooking.

AWESOME Korean, I might add. They do have a small selection of basic sushi rolls but their Korean BBQ is so good that I didn't even miss the sushi (much).  My husband and I stopped by for my birthday on Nov. 15th thinking it would be AYCE sushi and after meeting Mr. Lee we decided to stay and eat.  The lunch menus looked so simple and tbh I had my heart set on sushi so I was considering going elsewhere but as we sat at a table perusing the menu Mr. Lee brought out two bowls of hot chicken cream soup that was made by his wife (she makes everything, from what I can tell and she has a real gift!).  Feeling obligated to stay at that point we settled in and sampled the soup - SO GLAD WE STAYED!  

The soup was wonderful!  I ordered a kind of sampler platter with some Korean \"pancakes\" and some shrimp and some pork dumplings.  My husband ordered the BBQ beef.  The meal also came with traditional sides like the best kimchi I've ever had, some little red pickled thingies, cucumber salad, seaweed salad, and steamed white rice.  At the end of the meal, just as we were finishing up, Mr. Lee appeared with another complimentary dish, some kind of glass noodle and beef stir fry that put us over the top.  The best part was when he asked \"what would you like more of?\".  We were both full even before the glass noodle surprise had arrived so we assured him that we couldn't eat another bite but the offer made me feel like we were in Korea in the Lee's home kitchen having family dinner with them.  I haven't been offered 'seconds' since the last time I visited my mom's house.  All in all, great authentic Korean food, super sweet couple.  

The atmosphere is very casual and I was a little bit bummed to not see Pho on the menu (the one Korean dish I have always wanted to try, and I bet Mrs. Lee has a seriously great recipe for it) but all in all I was extremely impressed and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I happened to be in the shopping center were this establishment a few weeks ago. My girlfriend saw the sign that said sushi so went inside to get one to go. The gentleman who attended me was very attentive and asked me to sit down which was a first. You usually dont expect them to ask you to sit and chat which i thought was really cool. I ended up getting a Dragon Roll for my girl and she absolutely loved it. The ingredients were fresh starting from the rice to the eel and everything in between. Definitely will be coming back when were in the neighborhood. Recommended to anyone! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to try this place!  The restaurant is a cute little place with minimal decor.  Right when fiancé and I walked in, we were greeted by the sweetest man!  As he was serving us complimentary soup, he said, \"My wife cooked this.  She cooks very well.\"  Melted my heart!

We order Kim-Bop, Bi-Bim-Bop, and Bolgolgi.  A++ quality!  I asked for sauce for the the Kim-Bop (family traditional roll)... BUT IT DIDNT NEED IT!  They were full of flavor!  They also surprised us with some Jap-Chae, I must say it was the absolute best Jap-Chae I have ever had!  

It is a husband and wife tag-team.  Sweetest people ever.  Service was superb.  Will be returning soon for more Jap-Chae!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews on here, which were super positive, and decided to take my parents and girlfriend. 

The reviews were spot on. The couple that owns this place are really sweet and the wife cooks all the food. Hands down the best Bi Bim Bop I've had anywhere. My dad never tries new things and this was his first attempt at Korean and he loved the bbq pork! Mom had the dumpling soup and it was awesome.  Great flavor. Everything was fresh and make to order. They even brought us two appetizers to sample on to see if we liked them. They, too, were amazing. 

Not much in the way of decor, but if your desire is to have real authentic Korean food then look no further. You found it here."}
{"text":"I eat at a lot of places and rarely do I take the time to write a review... unless my experience was exceptional. This little gem is absolutely everything. This Korean BBQ joint is owned by the sweetest elder  couple. The husband was a chemical engineer and his wife was a registered nurse for most of their lives. The husband told me that when they both retired, they decided that they wanted to open a Korean restaurant so they could enjoy people and have them eat his wife's amazing cooking.  I have never in my life ate anywhere where I was welcomed and treated like.... family. The owner even said, \"we want to make sure you're happy because you are family.\" My boyfriend and I were blow away and our hearts melted time and time again. And let me tell you, if you want a Korean meal that tastes like it comes from the heart, then this is the place to come to. I honestly felt like we were guests in someone house and joining them for a home-cooked meal. It was amazing. They take pride in what they serve, everything is homemade and cooked from scratch. If you're in the area, definitely check this place out and give support to this amazing place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a small and cozy mom-and-pop restaurant that serves delicious and affordable meals. I've been here twice now and have not been disappointed. For starters, they serve the usual banchan and also their specialty creamy chicken soup. With your meal, they also throw in a side dish of Japchae on a separate platter. That was a delightful surprise, and the Japchae was soooo delish!!! On my first visit, I had the Korean Meatball Patties and on my second visit, I had the Beef Bulgogi. I especially enjoyed the Bulgogi!"}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Korean dishes and have tried so many from a lot of different restaurants, but this is truly the best I have experienced! I highly recommend their spicy beef bulgogi. 
The place is quiet, relaxing, and a perfect enviornment to have a meal in
Customer service is the best i have ever experienced! This restaurant is truly amazing and all of the food taste AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been out here in vegas for about 8 months now and I am sooooo happy to have found this place! The service and the food is amazing! I loveeee korean food and I have made it my mission to find one in vegas and this by far is definitely the best! (And I've dragged my bf to every single one out here since we moved) The husband and wife that owns it is super sweet and gives you such great service! The food again, is amazing :) I love how they give you free appetizers to try too! This is definitely our go to place and if you love korean food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Authentic korean restaurant and food.  I had tofu soup that was as good as anything I ate when living in Korea. The banchan and mandu were excellent!  The service was excellent. It is a do again restaurant."}
{"text":"Great people. They were amazing and gave me great service. The gentlemen was very nice and tried to get to know his customers, which is always a plus! Amazing food too!!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in wall Korean restaurant. Most food was good. There are better places to go for sushi but everything else we tried was really good"}
{"text":"The food is the star in this Mom & Pop restaurant. The husband and wife who run it ,cook and wait tables are fantastic. Even before we ordered they brought us creamy Korean soup to whet our appetites it was awesome.They make you feel at home and are properly fed Korean Style.  The bibimbap my husband and I had was delicious and filling. My daughter had the fish katsu it was wonderful as well. I would definitely recommend visiting this little Jewel, food and the people are both warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"The sweetest couple who run this is restaurant make you feel so at home! Amazing service and great food for a great price! What else can you ask for?! 


Definitely an awesome Mom-and-Pop stop for my lunch-time cravings"}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place is the bomb!Just drove in from Los Angeles and wanted something not too heavy.The owner*s wife first brought us a creme soup,very good.I recommend this small cozy restraunt to everyone. ."}
{"text":"great little hole in wall place for pretty authentic Korean food. my best friend and I usually make monthly trips to California for some good Korean and Taiwanese cuisine as Vegas tends to offer less of a selection, but he introduced me to this place with one of my best girlfriends. 

the Korean owners and I had quite a bit of a chat in regards to food culture and Korean cuisine in general. mr. lee was extremely hospitable and an amazing chef. the two definitely knew how to make us all feel at home and the food brought back nostalgia of my mom and grandma's food growing up. we ordered a bunch of things to try like we always do, this time including the pork bulgogi, kalbi, korean pancake plate, kimchi fried rice, and the dolsot bibimbap. everything was absolutely on point in terms of flavor, presentation, and texture for everything. I really enjoyed the pork bulgogi the most because of its great balance of spices and sweetness. definitely the highlight of my meal! the wait is definitely worth it for the quality of the food. if you have little patience, you might want to go elsewhere? but, for good Korean food, friendly and hospitable service, you can't go wrong trying this place"}
{"text":"I've already left a post about this place when it was still called M Sushi, but apparently the name has changed and it completely deserves another review.  

The food here is always great.  Although I'm not Korean, and therefore do not have a Korean grandmother, this is exactly how I would hope she'd cook food.  The dishes are well portioned, flavorful, and delicious.  My 7 year old likes the soon dubu, my 5 year old likes the meatballs and the kim bap.  I'm a pig and eat everything :)

Service here is still one of my favorite in the city.  I am greeted by name (I'm called \"Mr. Justin when I walk through the door.  No joke).  I feel like I'm at a family dinner, in the best possible way.  My youngest son talks about going to dinner \"with the nice man\".  Always a fantastic dining experience.

If you're ever in the Henderson area and want great home cooked food and want to feel like family, this is the spot.  Come hungry, leave happy."}
{"text":"Very nice. Will do again. Had Bi bim bap and beef bulgogi and penko fish. Really enjoyed the owners."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!!  They gave us a creamy soup while we waited for our order. We ordered Bulgogi rolls, kimchi fried rice, Korean rolls, Korean ribs, and it came with little side dishes.  Everything was so good!!  It's family owned. They've only been open for less than 2 years. The owners are so friendly!!! We highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place was sooooo Delicious! Such amazing service and the owners are such wonderful people. I had the fried dumplings and they were the best I've had. Love this place'n"}
{"text":"Outside you'll think that the place would be no good... Because the signage is missing letters, but i really miss bimbimbap so i have to try this one...
And its not a surprise, i know its going to be good, coz a saw the chef is a korean mid-age lady, like a korean mom... I already know this is going to be legit... And it is...try it guys specially the bimbimbap... I love it"}
{"text":"Great family style Korean food. Very comforting and delicious. Especially the kimchi side dishes, fresh and perfect compliments with rice and stir fry noodles and pork bulgogi. A little hard to communicate but we enjoyed everything they brought us."}
{"text":"Wonderful mom and pop restaurant! Great price and food!"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for something different. We came across this restaurant on Yelp, from the outside it didn't look like anything extraordinary but once we stepped in, we received the warmest welcome ever. I think there is only two people working there so we had to get up to grab our drinks, which is okay because the service and the food made up for that. The husband brought food out and his wife made the meals. Both of them are incredible people, so kind and friendly. The food, oh my god the food was heavenly! That lady deserves 100 stars. I thought after having so much food it would be expensive but it wasn't. After pampering our bellies with so much deliciousness, they gave us a drink that is supposed to help with your digestion and it was delicious. If you go to this place, make sure you have enough time to enjoy the service, these people will pamper your stomach, the way loving moms and Nanas do. We will come back, and make sure people hear about this place because they are simply amazing."}
{"text":"There are many reasons as to why this place is awesome.  This place was kind of hard to find because the sign says \"M Sushi,\" but on the window it says Korean BBQ and Rolls.  Located on the west corner of the building from Trader Joes.

Small restaurant with few seats.  This is literally a mom and pop shop where the only people working is a man and his wife.  They were very friendly and personable.  

You start with a small bowl of some creamy chicken soup.  Amazing hearty flavor and I wish I had a second bowl.  I'd call this more of a teaser than appetizer....I want more!!

I ordered the bulgogi and my friend Ardie had the Spicy Tofu soup.  Both were just okay.  

The Korean Style stir fry noodles were the best!  These had the clear noodles with mushrooms, veggies, and beef.  We shared a plate and it was so tasty that we asked for a second plate of this.  I think this was part of the appetizer.  I ate this as if this was the main thing that I ordered, and had more than the bulgogi that I ordered.

The bulgogi could've used more flavor, but it was still good.  I was too busy eating the stir fry noodles that I was too full to eat the rest of my bulgogi.  

I tried the spicy kimchi tofu soup, and it tasted a little bland.  Could have been spicier and less watery.  

After we were finished, the owner gave us a cup of fermented rice tea with honey to \"help with digestion.\"  Sure, why not.  It was delicious, and again, I wanted more.  

Overall, I had a good experience with this place and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love the food.  The owners are the elderly couple who make traditional Korean food that is so tasty that i can come back regularly if we live in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I'll definitely be bringing my friends here. My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted by the owner. He is very friendly and works hard to make sure that you are having a great time. He even gave us complimentary dishes. His wife cooks the food and it all tastes amazing. She'll even bring out dishes to patrons. Five stars for this establishment!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give more than 5 stars, because this place definitely deserves more. The restaurant is run by a husband and wife team & they are the sweetest people you will ever meet. They're very hospitable and always make sure that you have enough food and drinks. I love the fact that they do not use MSG and artificial sweeteners, which makes the food taste so much better. Everything you order is super fresh and is cooked to perfection. The portion sizes are phenomenal and the prices are amazing. Between two of us we ordered the bulgogi roll and the kalbi, which was more than enough food. I don't think I'll be going anywhere else:)"}
{"text":"This place is literally a prime example of a mom and pop shop -- Mr. Lee, in his socks and house slippers, cheerfully takes your order while his wife, Mrs. Lee, merrily cooks up the goods in the kitchen. The restaurant takes up only a small space and looks rather plain, but this tag-teamin' elderly Korean couple make it work... and you can't help but root for them! :)

We stopped in for lunch time. We were served a shallow dish of creamy chicken soup to start. It was flavorful and resembling something I've tasted before, but couldn't quite pin. I ordered the #12 MO DEUM JEON, which was an assortment of meat and fish \"pancakes,\" served with a bowl of rice. I don't eat Korean food often, so it was entirely new to me. My sister got the #14 SPICY PORK BULGOGI and my dad had the #15 BEEF BULGOGI, which Mr. Lee recommended for him. Both these orders came on sizzling platters and both were enjoyed. We also got the #10 JAPCHAE, a type of glass noodle dish, similar to the Filipinos' pansit sotanghon. Small side dishes of kimchi, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and tofu were included and refillable. For the 3 of us, our tab came out to $45, which is not bad at all. Go visit!"}
{"text":"First time here,  and I would go back.  The food was tasty and refreshing.  The meal started off with a complimentary soup that was full of unexpected amazing tasty flavors.  I had the fish katsu ,  and it was crunchy and fresh . I am normally a picky eater,  and would of not came if my girlfriend didn't have meal choice today,  but I am glad she dragged me a long."}
{"text":"Prior to going to the movies, Earl and I had dinner here.  When we arrived, there was one other table that was finishing up.  We shared the fried dumplings which comes with a bowl of rice, seaweed salad, and pickled radish.  The dumplings were good, but didn't quite go with the seaweed and the Japanese pickled radish.

Earl got the tofu stew with seafood.  Initially, we were going to go with the kimchi and beef, but Mr. Lee recommended the seafood because it has more flavor.  We were so happy with the tofu stew.

Our meal came with the following banchan: kimchi, zucchini, tofu, and bean sprouts.  I didn't care for those banchan because they haven't reach that fermentation that I would liked it to be.

We were also given a bowl of cream of chicken soup.  This was delicious.  I would order this if it was on the menu.  Our meal ended with free strawberry mocha icecream.

Also, we ordered bottled water that came when we were finishing up dinner.

Overall, the food was awesome and the service was great, taking into account that this small spot is served and managed by only Mr. and Mrs. Lee.  Mr. Lee is very funny and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very friendly!! Food was delicious! I had the spicy tuna roll & my husband had the pork bolgogi (which I tried and was really good)!! Very friendly staff! Will be back again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"4 stars - This place is solid. 
I wanted to visit this place a couple times before I wrote my review.  Here are my thoughts. 

Food- Its made fresh every time and it's delicious. Yes they have run out of things but like others have mentioned it is owned and operated by a husband and wife team. Very often we have been given a complimentary starter soup and omelette both of which are delicious. Recommendations are the soondubu, rice balls ( tofu pockets stuffed with seasoned rice), and Kalbi. 

Service- The service can be slow but they are pleasant and kind people. Our only issue is the wait time but because the food is made by his wife alone and it's fresh it is understandable. Let them know if you need to leave by a certain time or don't go there if you're under time constraints. 

People have commented on the ambience/decor, yes it may be lacking however this is not fine dining and they don't pretend to be. You're there to eat good food, and they provide a good atmosphere for just that."}
{"text":"As soon as we came in, the husband and wife duo were serving us homemade cream chicken soup (on the house). After everyone but us had left, they continued serving us free pan fried noodles and told us if we wanted more to just ask. They were extremely accommodating and kind people who opened this restaurant to SERVE. This place is a must try, the beef bulgogi is amazing!"}
{"text":"They had a really good food here, also the side dishes. I had a Spicy Grilled Chicken...it was delicious"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem and what made it better is that it is a mom and pop shop. When we enter we was greeted by a adorable grandma and was seated right away. Their lunch menu is a great price and they had so many options to chose from. We ordered the noodles, beef bulgogi and the katsu. First they gave us chicken soup. It was delicious and I wanted more. It tasted just like the type of soup i would get when I was a kid. When the food came out everything was delicious and flavorful. Our favorite was the soup and the noodles. We couldn't stop eating it. I was so full from the noodles and I couldn't eat my bulgogi anymore. the husband would keep asking if we wanted more side dishes. They acted like my grandparents when we ate at their house. I felt like they was feeding one of their own grandchild and making sure we ate enough. They were very sweet and we will for sure come back."}
{"text":"This mom and pops restaurant is delicious. They might not have the greatest service because it is just the two of them and they both do no speak English well, but the food makes up for it. 

My sister and I came in for lunch and ordered off the lunch special menu. We shared a \"Mo deum jeon\" which came with one platter of food, 2 side dishes, and two bowls of rice. Also, Mr. Lee brought out two small bowls of a homemade creamy, chicken soup as an appetizer. Everything was very flavorful, authentic, and healthy. 

If you are craving homemade Korean food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Can i write over 5 stars because the service was amazing! Super clean and friendly owners. It was my first time last week and they were super awesome! Food was great; so many side dishes for FREE! Best japche noodles I've ever had. Will come back over and over cuz of the yummy food and the best customer service!"}
{"text":"If you want good Korean food, this is the place to go. The owner checked on us several times and had to turn guests away 30 minutes before closing because they sadly ran out of food. Come early so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I love the people, and i like the food, and im so so on the location and decor. 

Ill break this up into two parts, the good and the bad. So the good is the same that everybody has talked about, as the couple are the sweetest people and genuinely want you to enjoy your food and leave satisfied. I mean how many places bring you samples of food for you to try even after your full from your meal? Not many and that gives me the feel of going home to my grandmother who never wants to stop feeding me. Both husband and wife were very nice, especially my interaction with the husband with my limited Korean we really had a nice conversation.

The bad but not totally bad is the location is certainly not setup for date night or anything more that a super casual location/spot. And its just the two that run the place, so the wait for your bill, food, drink etc could take a little bit as its hard to be demanding of such a genuine gentleman trying to keep the front of the house. Last thing that was sort of a negative to me was that when i heard of a mom/pop spot with Korean food i thought traditional comfort food. Maybe some jajangmyeon, galbi jjim, or something other than the standard fair like Kalbi, Bulgogi, and bibimbap offerings. 

I wouldnt make a special trip, but if your in the area and want a good lunch at a good price and time isnt an issue. Stop on by as im sure you will be pleased like so many others."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. Greeted and seated immediately. Love the couple that run the place. So nice and they make you feel like you are eating at a friend or family members home instead of a restaurant. First they serve you this creamy chicken soup that is complimentary, then they take your order. I had been here before and ordered the korean meatballs, but I did not see it on the dinner menu but when I asked about it, the gentleman said I could still order it for dinner. We also got he spicy pork, comes out on a sizzling platter and just the right amount of spice. Traditional sides came with it and then the cook comes out with a bowl of chopchae (korean fried noodles), she said complimentary service, it was amazing, not oily how some place make it. All in all, wonderful service and great korean food. Will be back"}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to as I was turned away at the door.

In the owner's defense, the place was full, and even though a group had just left, he would've had to clear a table before I could sit, but I was never given the option to wait.

He just stood beside his \"We retain the right to refuse service to anyone\" sign, and told me that they could not serve me."}
{"text":"Best korean food I've had in the states yet. Much like everyone has agreed, it is a literal mom and pop shop and they are very giving. After ordering my tofu soup, he gave me a free sample of thier beef stir fry. Everything tasted amazing and after I was done he even offered to refill my plates for free. It felt like visiting family by the way they interracted with people and the serving portions they offered. If I wasn't visiting this town I wouldve deffinately been frequenting this restuarant."}
{"text":"The couple that run this place are a little disorganized, but they try very hard to please. I enjoyed everything.  The pace is a bit slow, so this is a place that's best if you can spend some time."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be treated like family and given 17 times the amount of food you originally ordered. This place is so great! The food has the best flavor and all of the little \"good digestion\" extras keep your tummy super happy.

I wish I lived in this state so I could come visit these lovely people everyday. One things for sure I will be coming here every single time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new sushi place.  However, we encountered a few problems when we arrived that caused us to leave without ordering.

After seating us, the staff ignored us for several minutes, despite the fact that there were only a few guests in the restaurant.  We had to flag down a server to take our drink order.  She refused to give us tap water, stating that she could only serve us bottled water, which she had to charge for.  When it came to ordering food, she refused to honor a coupon we had, claiming that ownership had changed.  Why not do the right thing and honor the coupon anyway to try to make sure guests have a good experience at your new restaurant?

Since we received poor service and were nickel and dimed twice right off the bat, we decided to leave rather than order, and went to another sushi place down the block, where we had a much better experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Complimentary soup was wonderful along with everything we had. We tried a Dragon roll, beef bolgogi and the owner brought out a noodle dish that was divine. All the sides were so tasty!  The attentive service really made our experience special. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I must say that this place really has changed. The food and service are fantastic. Maybe a little bit slow. But so worth the wait."}
{"text":"The halmoni and halapoji running the show are so sweet, sweet, sweet. They brought over a bunch of the usual Korean starters and even some homemade chicken soup (which was AMAZING) and sweetened rice drink for us. 
The restaurant is small (~5 tables) and a little run down from the outside, don't be turned away! 
We ordered bulgogi (served on hot stone like it should be!) kalbi and japchae from the lunch menu. All three were great-- my favorite was the japchae. Both the bulgogi and japchae had the perfect vegetables to meat/noodle ratio! 
Finally a decent Korean restaurant in Henderson! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean place I've been to since moving from LA to LV.

I had the japchae and bulgogi.  The banchan was delicious and properly fermented and seasoned.  Both the japchae and bulgogi had so many vegetables you rarely see in them except when you make them yourself at home.  The japchae had 2 different mushrooms, fresh scallions, seasoned beef, carrots (my mouth is watering just thinking of it again) and was made to order.  The bulgogi was prepared with carrots, mushrooms, and onions.  At other restaurants, I only see onions and a ton of sugar to try and mask the old meat taste.  But the bulgogi I had at this place was fresh and the colors were aesthetically pleasing (in addition to tasting delicious haha).

It is indeed a mom and pop operation and as a medical student who misses Korean food this hit the spot.  Mr. Lee is very attentive and very entertaining.

Apparently, the couple started the restaurant because they felt idle living with their children in Boston so they up and moved to Henderson.  Mr. Lee also told me that he is a retired chemical engineer and doesn't add sugar or MSG to the food (I agree that they don't add any of those things... the food tastes naturally sweet and there isn't the gross aftertaste of MSG).

When I left, Mr. Lee said to come back any time I missed Korean food but not every day. Haha!"}
{"text":"Good is delicious and one of the only Korean restaurants with Kimbap...... So good!! The owners work hard and are very friendly.m!!"}
{"text":"A must go spot if you like Korean food.  A little hard to find but next to Trader Joes."}
{"text":"Incredible experience. Great mom-and-pop shop and the gentleman takes a great deal of time with people. The food is incredible and he is very attentive with his customers. I will happily return. 
Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Can i say.. This is my go to place for Korean BBQ! 

I've passed this place a few times when I used to work in the area, but I never really paid attention. It's been years and this was when it was still M sushi. I was greeted by Mr. Lee and his wife and right away, I knew I was going to love the place. Mr Lee is so kind and you can really tell he cares about his customers. He cared enough to get to know me and even if it was small talk, It made my day. His wife immediately distributed my soup while i waited for my boyfriend. I saw other yelpers say that the food was going to take longer because it is a husband and wife team , so I automatically ordered. It took less than 10 minutes for my food and they even offered us complimentary noodles! what place offers you authentic and free food? It was just the two of us so the couple offered us some privacy. Mr Lee would check on us from time to time and encouraged to eat as much as we can. Not many places even care enough to see if you're happy with the meal that was given to you. We left knowing that we'll be back soon. Mr Lee, if you read this.. Keep up the great work from you and your wife!"}
{"text":"No MSG, no artificial flavoring. It's like eating mom's food in Henderson. Everything is so amazingly delicious and the owners are generous and friendly beyond your wildest imagination. A must try restaurant if you're craving Korean food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a true mom & pop ran Korean restaurant. 
They do it all, serve, cook and socialize between everything else.
the menu is basic, but covers the basics... with a few rolls tossed in.

The food was great, very much homemade style, almost as my wife's halmoni would make.
The service is great, and you feel like they want to make sure your food and time there is a good experience.

a must try if you need a kimchi fix.
We will be back, and often."}
{"text":"Back when this place was called M Sushi my wife and I would visit every once in a great while, now that the Lee's have taken ownership and started serving authentic homemade Korean food I think we'll be here every week. 

Our first visit was fantastic and was an experience unlike any other restaurant I've ever been to. Before they even brought us a menu they were bringing us food. Even after we'd ordered they continued to bring us other foods to try (just to be clear, they only charged us for what we ordered). It's like when someone discovers something great and they tell everybody \"you have to try this\"! That's how the Lee's are about their own cooking. The food is fantastic and the Lee's are amazing hosts. They are so kind and so genuine and serve such good food! 

I highly recommend the Korean Pancakes, the kimchi fried rice and the pork bulgogi (a big sizzling plate of seasoned bbq pork that was just amazing)!

UPDATE: We've been back here many times now and have tried numerous dishes, none of which have disappointed. The Korean Stir Fried Noodles are great, the pan fried white fish is great, even the steamed rice is great! How do they make steamed white rice taste better than any other white rice I've ever had?!?

We went in for lunch a few days after New Years and after we had finished eating Mr. Lee came out with another meal in a to-go box for us to bring home to my wife's mother. They know us by name and they even know my mother-in-law well enough to think of her when she's not with us. Where else can you get that kind of service? 

Don't go there when you are in a rush, it won't be the same. Go there when you have time to truly enjoy your meal along with a healthy dose of true, old-fashioned, authentic hospitality and camaraderie."}
{"text":"Mr. & Mrs Lee do an amazing job! Their food is beyond delicious! Our stomachs and taste buds are overloaded with joy! 
Very great customer service. We felt like family while enjoying the food and listening to Mr. Lees' story. 
Don't expect speed to get your food but the wait is very worth it!!!! Everything is hand made from scratch. You can really taste the love that goes into the healthy food. 

YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!! 

Thank you for your hospitality Mr. & Mrs Lee! 
-The Francisco's"}
{"text":"I ordered the galbi, and my wife had bulgogi. Both dishes were excellent. The owners were very attentive and so sweet with our son (he loved the chicken soup). We love coming to Korean BBQ and Rolls every time we are in Vegas. To the owners, thank you for your hospitality and kindness. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This food will blow your mind!  The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait.  We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings...all fabulous!  The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special."}
{"text":"Awesome hole-in-the-wall kind of place! They serve authentic Korean food, taste so yummy. I was 110% satisfied with the food and service. The owners are so humble and friendly. I would recommend this to anyone who knows and loves Korean!"}
{"text":"Again, as a Korean food snob, this place is totally legit. Reminds me of Mom's home cooking. It is truly a \"Mom and Pop\" restaurant where the husband and wife are both working their tails off. Chap Chae is awesome!

@Juliana who complained about how they need to hire a server and gave a one star based on this. Maybe you should get an MBA then you would understand words like cost structure, variable expenses, contribution margin, paying into workman's comp, etc.....It is not always a good idea to hire all the time depending on your profit margins. 
Until then, go out and own a business...Sorry I forgot...Which Fortune 500 company are you a CEO, CMO, COO, or CFO at?"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Picked up daughter at airport and wanted something other than fast food.  Read about this place on YELP and it did not disappoint.  My only regret is that I live in another state.  Arrived around 4 pm on a Friday, we were the only customers, but greeted with a smile and seated.  The owner, filled us in on the benefits of Korean food, fermination, his life story, and selected our meal for us as we were both new to Korean cuisine.  His wife the cook is a jewel.  The cream of chicken soup is my new comfort food and I actually found myself eating all the little relishesm which I normally eschew.  When we left another couple of people had arrived so I hope they are able to stay in business.  Prices are reasonable.  Do not miss this opportunity."}
{"text":"Although I can see big areas this place can work on if you come here with a little patience in mind it is well worth the wait. With a little help and time this place will be extremely successful. It's got a really sweet and adorable mom and pop feel and the food is absolutely amazing and the prices make it even better. They gave us a free creamy chicken soup appetizer and during our meal a big portion of the stir fry noodles and when I got the receipt turns out he didn't even charge me for the rice tea he gave us and I got two servings and he gave me a double portion to go which I was super happy about. The bulgogi was the best I've ever had and so was the Kalbi. The Korean pancakes with the imitation crab in it was delicious. Hands down the best Korean food I've had period. Mr. Lee is extremely nice and was extremely personable and super sweet and really made the experience overall awesome. I would go there everytime I eat out if it wasn't so far from home. 
Overall I would really like to see the owners get some signage. 
The thing about this place is you really have to just go in there with a different attitude. Come in as if you were going to your grandmas house for dinner and you will have an amazing experience. Don't expect super fast quick service and you may have to ask for a thing or two but it's well worth it. They are so sweet and hard working its a place that make you feel good for going to for so many different reasons."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's run by the sweetest and polite Korean couple.... I was in the neighborhood and starving. Went on yelp and read the reviews and decided to try it. The restaurant it's really small, plain and only a couple of tables. I was greeted by a cute little old Korean lady... She was so polite and immediately got us our menu and thank me and my friend for coming. She took our order without writing it down and got it right. She even told us not to order too much food because it would be to much for us to finish. While she cooked the meals her husband washed the dishes and would checked up on us and kept saying how his wife was the best cook ever and he was completely right.. Really great home tasting food. Will definitely be coming back even it it's not near my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a true mom and pop operation that you can tell is a labor of love on the part of owners, Mr. & Mrs. Lee.  I suspect as retired professionals, he an engineer and she a nurse, they are not financially dependent on the success of the restaurant.  She does most of the cooking while he serves and talks.  We decided to share orders of Korean style stir fry noodles and BBQ chicken.  

While waiting for our entrees, we were given complimentary cups of a delicious creamy chicken soup.  Next came 4 tiny servings of banchan - kimchee, pickled vegetable, seaweed salad and seasoned mung bean sprouts.  This was followed by a pair of rice balls, a salmon salad plus larger portions of both kimchee and seaweed salad followed by our entrees  Everything was homemade and delicious.  Prior to departing, cups of a refreshing cold rice tea were brought to our table.  Being the recipients of such generosity and graciousness, I felt compelled to offer to help with the dishes or at least to sweep up the floor, but Mr. Lee kindly declined my offer so I substituted a generous gratuity."}
{"text":"This place is so good. By far the best Korean restaurant I have ever been to and experienced. The owners are awesome and the food is so authentic and delicous. I highly recommend this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"Very small and neat mom-and-pop shop with excellent food.  The restaurant is on the small, I mean very small, side, with only about 10 tables and the personality of a typical whole in the wall sort of place.  The service, as other have mentioned, is somewhat slow as the mom and pop are the only people who seem to work there.  Mom makes the food and pop serves it.  That being said, it is impossible to be upset with the service because the man is so nice and welcoming and he wants you to enjoy all of your food.  The extra dish of food he brings out for you to try, we had the Jap Chae, was so good and the fermented rice drink is also a pleasant  end to the meal.  While this place is listed at a $ I do not think that is totally accurate.  Most menu items are more than $10, though you could technically eat for under $10 per person I think you would still be hungry.  Despite the creamy chicken soup, hot pot Bim Bi Bap that I had as well as the sides, Jap Chae, and fermented rice drink, I was still hungry when I left.  Just not enough foot for me.  I will still be back though for the friendly service and the little free goodies that you get."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Quiet atmosphere and delicious food at a great price. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Small hidden gem on Sunset and Green Valley. The outside sign still says M Sushi. Went in for the lunch special and food was YUMMY. We could hear other patrons saying the same things. There are some great extra things include din the lunch special - an opening soup and then after you're done with the main meal, some jap chae (clear noodles) and some type of semisweet rice drink.

I had the pork cutlet (tonkatsu) which was lean and not greasy. My fiancé had the beef bulgogi - very generous portions and also lean. She grew up in Korea and was very impressed with the food. 

We'll definitely stop by again. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner couple are the nicest people I have ever encountered. Super sweet and offers you free samples and yummy soup every time. They treat you like family, the more you come!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It's no coincidence that these places tend to have great food and customer service. You can really taste the love they put into their food, and the owners are two of the nicest people I've met in the service industry.

I came here with a friend for lunch, and we hadn't eaten all day, so we ordered a bunch of food. The owner seemed quite pleased, and he even offered us some extra food, on the house! They also give every customer a small dish of creamy chicken soup to start, which was delicious. As was everything else. My two personal highlights were the bibimbap and the tofu soup.

I would definitely recommend this place if you like Korean food and a friendly, relaxing atmosphere. I just wish I lived closer, so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"It's rare that you receive both outstanding food AND service. You can feel the love these people have for their culture. The flavors of the dishes were out of this world. Everything was fresh and tasted incredible. You can tell they take pride in the quality of food they put out. The hospitality is enough to practically bring you to tears. It was an absolute pleasure to dine here. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop restaurant. Nothing fancy but it feels warm and cozy. I work close by so this will be my favorite spot from now"}
{"text":"An enjoyable understated affair!  This is a very modest, very homey place.  Whereas it may lack in decor and ambiance, is more than made up by the friendliness of the owners and their wonderful home cooked food!

Ambiance - Very undecorated and very plain.
Menu - Simple, basic foods with a bit of variety.
Food - Very, very nice and the servings are very large!

a. Korean Fried Rice - Very fresh and tasty. Plenty of chunks of beef, although you could have ordered it with pork also. I think it was almost made right to order.

b.  SoonDobu - The soft tofu came with a raw egg and sizzling hot to the point it was still boiling. I ordered it to the hottest spice level and it was mild to me, and yet very good at the same time.  This Soondobu was full of tofu and pork and kimchi.  It was almost like a stew. I definitely felt i got my money's worth.

c.  Pork Bulgogi - Normally have Beef, but the son ordered this and it was very tasty. Comes on a hot plate and sizzling. All the pork is laying atop a bed of chopped cabbage that is great to absorb all the juices and makes the veggies more tasty.

d.  Korean Roll - This is nearly identical to the Hawaiian rolls that my wife always has when relatives come over and the taste brought back some great memories of family and Hawaii. Not too many places make this and I really enjoyed it.

e.  Jop Chae - Just when we thought we were done, the owner brings out an order of Job Chae as a gift.  Loved the glassy noodles and the al dente texture. A great meal itself and on the menu it is I believe it is over 9.00 for this dish.

When  you first sit down, you will get a small bowl of home made creamy chicken soup.  You will get some very fresh banchan that is very simple and tasty. For dessert, they will give you a cup of a sweet drink.

The service is wonderful, the food satisfying. While it may not be the best ever Korean Food, and may not be the best ever decor, the service, the family, the home style makes this place a special place and one to go back to many times!"}
{"text":"It's an old Korean man serve us he was nice, I actually love this place it's good! The guy was nice, kept giving us complimentary food I loved it ! And we just ordered tofu soup & galbi as usual"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this restaurant.  It has very good galbi, beef bulgogi, and spicy pork bulgogi.  Also the service is outstanding.  The Korean couple that own and run this place are super friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable experience.  So I strongly suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon just before noon, and there were only two tables of customers. Walked in, we didn't get acknowledged for at least 3 minutes so we decided to just sit down. We didn't know the routine so a customer actually helped us out and gave us a menu. Eventually the owner came and told us one was lunch menu and one was dinner menu. We flipped through the menus and waited, another 10 minutes went by and still waiting, no water or anything, and at that point, we were just so turned off by the entire experience that we just left.

I understand that it's a wife and husband team managing the whole place, but come on, what kind of non existent customer service is that? I love Korean food and was really looking forward to trying this place out because of the good reviews, but we will never return. Not worth the stress."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the owners are so, so nice.  The food was great and they brought 3 complimentary sides (in addition to the condiments)
Go for lunch until 2:30, it's a great value"}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect hole-in-the-wall atmosphere with delicious BBQ. The couple who owns it is adorable and hospitable. Dumplings are amazing"}
{"text":"Little hidden secret in the Green Valley area. Place is owned and operated by a husband and wife team. She cooks, he serves. Came here for lunch and was served soup with the lunch special. The food is definitely excellent and tastes homemade."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean food and stopped at this hidden spot next to Trader Joe's off Green Valley Pkway.  The owners are very nice and came out with a chicken cream soup.. which was good. I ordered Galbi and Japchae and it was okay.. love the owners... wanna luv the food too, but its a place i would come if i was in the area only"}
{"text":"The place for delicious Korean food. Wait time for food may seem long since the owner's wife cooks all orders but totally worth the wait. The owner is entertaining and attentive---such an impeccable customer service."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but do plan on going back again sometime very soon. For the past month I have been craving Korean BBQ and decided to try this place with a friend who hasn't tried it before. 

She ordered the Pork Katsu and I ordered the Beef Bulgolgi. Not long after we ordered we were presented with appetizers that come with dining in: kimchi, fish cake, this egg dish with onion and carrot, and cucumber kimchi(do not know the actual name of it). I have never really been to big on kimchi, mainly due to the smell, so I passed on the appetizers. My friend however loved the kimchi and the cucumber, she left no trace of them on the table.

Upon arrival, my bulgolgi plate was literally steaming. Cabbage topped with the meat, all on a sizzling hot plate. The flavor was amazing, and the quality of the ingredients is hard to beat. My friend was equally impressed with her food. The pork was breaded with panko crumbs, which was very, very light (she let me try a piece ;) ), and came served with red radish and seaweed. Both had a sort of sweet flavor that I was really impressed with, especially since I don't exactly have either of them too often.
The restaurant is run by a wonderful elderly couple, who say they do not do this for the money, purely for the passion, and it really shows in the food. They really care about the quality and freshness of the ingredients and make sure that every bit of food you receive serves it's purpose.

I plan on coming again real soon to try some more!"}
{"text":"I had driven past this place quite a few times, but the poorly lit  \"M Sushi\"  sign failed to spark the slightest bit of curiosity in me. It wasn't until a couple months later, I was looking for some damn-good bibimbap and stumbled across this place as an option. I was completely stumped. What?! A japanese sushi joint with bomb korean food?! Hmm... still decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I were greeted by the most cordial gentlemen and we were seated immediately. Although the inside of the restaurant reminded me of a grab-and-go teriyaki spot, the service throughout our dining experience was comparable to none other than the kitchen of my Asian grandmother. We were looking at  the menu, and the gentleman (whom I later learned to be the owner of the restaurant) brought us korean pancakes for an appetizer. No, we didn't order them, but they were pretty darn delicious (and free!). They were made courtesy of his wife, the cook. After finishing them, we were offered more, but declined.... we were ready to eat. I ordered bibimbop and my boyfriend got the kimchii rice. Neither of the two fell short of complete satisfaction. Of course, we also received the 4-5 korean side dishes, typical to most restaurants of the sort. All very traditional and tasty! A couple of the sides (the potato and the cabbage) were devoured quicker than the others, and we were promptly offered free \"refills\". Our waiter/host seemed to care most that we were satisfied and FULL before leaving, which is very commendable. He was surely not disappointed, because he and his wife filled us to our limits! After our appetizers, plentiful sides and generous entrees we were given some type of sweet fermented rice drink. I had never had it before, but it was amazing (oh, and we were given free refills!!). 

The name, M Sushi, made absolutely no sense. I think I may have seen a couple of generic sushi rolls on the menu, but the place was definitely Korean. I was happy to learn that they have successfully merged their menu to be completely Korean and the new name, Korean BBQ & Rolls, seems far more fitting. If you are from Hawaii and have high standards for korean bbq, you will not be disappointed, trust me! The service, in and of itself, deserves the highest rating possible on yelp! Please support this local Mom&Pop joint!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here, and I absolutely enjoyed my experience at this cute, humble Korean restaurant. The owners are a adorable elderly husband & wife duo who are super friendly and make you feel at home. The husband is the front of the house, and the wife works in the kitchen. They provide great customer service and will happily attend to your needs! I commend those who are happy on their jobs.

You can tell they are probably new to owning a business in the restaurant industry. I wasn't asked if I wanted something to drink, although if you ask them they will be quick to serve you. The restaurant is quiet and small with minimal decor, and there are only 5 tables, but don't let that turn you away. Their food and service quality are WORTH IT.

They put out the creamy chicken soup first, along with the basic side dishes. The soup was savory, delicious and the perfect amount for a starter dish. I ordered the kimchi fried rice and it was amazing and of homemade quality. It was $9, but the portion was big and it could easily feed 2 people. The wife gave me a free serving of japchae, which was equally as delicious.

I'm happy to say I will be coming back. :) The owners have my heart, and I am in love with this place already."}
{"text":"What surprises most people when eating Korean cuisine for the first time is the banchan -- the sides of pickled vegetables and other goodies brought to the table to accompany the meal. Its something you didn't expect, and in some respects is like a complimentary appetizer. Korean BBQ & Rolls takes it to the next level. The owners (a delightful husband and wife team) set down two plates with 6 different pickled vegetables. This was, however, preceded by a bowl of creamy chicken soup. After the pickled vegetables came a grilled salmon salad, and finally came pajeon (a thin scallion pancake). And this was all the stuff we didn't pay for (directly). It was all delicious. The salmon was still tender and flaky (a hair overdone, but that's just nitpicking). The kimchi was tart and perfectly seasoned (and homemade!).
For the main dishes, I was able to sample the bulgogi, pork katsu (they have a Japanese flare as well, probably to attract more business), the jap chae, the bibimbap, and the kimchi fried rice. You won't be disappointed with any of those, and likely not with anything else on the menu as well. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, and it is a very flavorful, hearty dish. If you're hungry its a good meal. If not, it's two good meals. The bulgogi is some of the best I've ever had.
After dinner, we were treated to a cup of sikhye (a sweetened fermented rice drink). Delicious, of course... and complimentary.
If you like variety, you'll get to try around 10 different dishes just for ordering a single entree. It'll run you like $12-$15. You'll also get the best service around. Other than ambiance, there is really nothing bad to say about Korean BBQ & Rolls."}
{"text":"Seriously you must go! The best Korean food in Las Vegas! The Japchae is the most tasty item on the menu. I was given it for free to taste. When I told the owner it was so good he gave me another free serving of it! The cream of chicken appetizer was also tasty. If you are in Vegas you must go to try this place. The owner treats you like a friend and makes you leave full, even if you didn't pay for some items, a true home feeling!Now if only they expanded and had all you can eat BBQ. Other than that this place is a Korean food heaven!"}
{"text":"This was THE coziest restaurant! I felt just like home. The elderly couple who owns this place were so welcoming and kind. Since it's just the two of them working, service isn't the fastest but the food was very fresh and light!  

We first got served complimentary creamy chicken soup which was absolutely delicious! I asked for seconds. My friends and I then got the Mo Deum Jeon lunch special which came with a bowl of rice  and banchan for $9.50. My favorite part was the crabmeat and scallion pancake. The lunch also had shrimp, pork pancakes and pollack pancakes. They have a variety of other lunch boxes to choose from too for any craving you have! The portions itself weren't the largest but the owner kindly gave us free jap chae to try which was delicious as well! 

Overall, this is a very quaint and peaceful restaurant that's perfect for a cozy lunch (I just wish the prices were a bit cheaper!). Just be aware that service might not be the fastest!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Loved This Place...
Read the reviews on Yelp and needed to give this place a try.  We were staying at the Courtyard (Henderson-Green Valley), which is right across the street.  The owner was very nice and very helpful, pointing out a few items he thought we might like and suggesting that we share a single meal.  He was right about the sharing.  We got two meals (wanted different things) and it was WAY too much food.  The meals were not flavorful and perfectly cooked.  The meat (Galbi) was so tender it melted in your mouth.  The sides (vegetables) were great, though I have no idea what they were.  My travel partner had the Korean Meatball patties and really enjoyed them as well.

All in all, I would absolutely go back any time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly mom and pop type restaurant.  Very small but very family style.  Run by husband and wife... Very good and tasty food- no msg used so that's a total bonus!  They first greet you with a dish of creamy chicken soup... Almost like minced chicken with a corn chowder like broth.  We had the spicy pork, bbq chicken, chop chae, dragon roll, and steamed mandoo.  Everything is prepared by the wife... While the husband greats and takes orders and is your server.  They are very friendly and it feels like you're in their home and they're hosting you.  We will definitely be back the next time we are here."}
{"text":"I cannot think of a better place to have my first baby free date. The hospitality was excellent. The food was delicious. I cannot wait to go back here. It was just that good."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food with some Japanese roll options.  Had the beef short ribs (galbi) and I had the mo deum jeon which is a combination of items.  Very fresh and delicious.  Owners are very friendly and nice.  We will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the service was beyond amazing. The owners Mr. and Mrs. Lee were very friendly, Mr. Lee took the time to get to know us as we waited for the food, and brought out excellent appetizers, which were all complimentary. They really take pride in their food, and they brought out extra food we did not order because they wanted to share the food with us (again complementary, we were not charged for anything we didn't order). Mr. Lee told us that his restaurant is a playground, not a business. They're there because they love to be there. 

If you're one to be put off by a poor decor (they never painted the restaurant, or decorated it after taking ownership of the restaurant and changing it from M Sushi) then be prepared to be disappointed on that front. But that's not what this place is about at all, it's about the food, and amazing hospitality you rarely find, especially in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to state that the hours on this page are wrong. This wonderful little restaurant is actually open from 11 AM-8:00 PM, Sun-Sat.

My boyfriend and I just moved to Henderson from San Diego, and we were in search of a good Korean restaurant in the area.  This is definitely the place!

Mr. Lee and his wife are both lovely people who really take pride in sharing their fresh, Korean home cooking. Our meal started with a creamy chicken soup, which was delicious. Mr. Lee even offered us seconds.

I ordered the mandugook (dumpling soup) and my boyfriend had the kalbi. Both dishes were delicious. Mrs. Lee makes the dumplings for the soup by hand, as opposed to the usual frozen dumplings at other Korean restaurants, and you can really tell the difference.

Also of note: the signs outside say \"Korean food\" and \"M Sushi,\" which is a little confusing. Though there are a few sushi choices on the menu that look delicious (I can't wait to try the kimbap next), it is definitely more of a Korean restaurant. The location is right across the street from Green Valley Library, in the shopping center with Trader Joes.

This place really should be packed! We will definitely be frequenting it often now."}
{"text":"Great food, price and excellent service!The owner-husband and wife are excellent! On the house were creamy chicken soup, appetizers, pancakes and Japchae!!! Yes, that much and delicious as well!!! We are a family of 4."}
{"text":"Great location, tasty food, Friendly fast service it was truly a welcoming surprise. I highly recommend this place to my family and friends."}
{"text":"They're open from 11am until 8pm. 

I came in because of yelp, with my 15 year old son. I've been trying to get my son to eat Korean food for years with no success but he LOVES this restaurant! 

He highly recommends the Korean version of crispy pot stickers. Big, meaty...crunchy. My son said these were the best he's ever had, and he's had a lot.

I had the Soft Tofu soup/stew. I can see having this when I'm sick. It was so comforting. It came to the table boiling in a special pot. You crack a raw egg into it. You can also put your rice into the soup or eat it separately, or dip a spoon of rice into the broth quickly.  I ordered it med hot but I may order it spicy next time. It was immensely flavorful medium spicy too. 

The couple that runs this place is so friendly, it is them that makes me want to come back. So polite. So respectful. So graceful, friendly, and accommodating. I even got to practice a little Korean.

I asked if we could watch a little Korean TV and they gave me the remote. They also adjusted the blinds behind us so we wouldn't be in the sun. Also, they gave us both a starter of homemade creamy chicken soup. Its just enough to satisfy you as you wait for your order. If its too big it would room your appetite. This tiny bowl was perfect because our main meal made us very full and satisfied.

Also, we had many good selections of banchan/kimchi. The husband noticed we liked two in particular and asked if we would like more.

We also had a wonderful dessert soup at the end. I think I tasted barley and rice. I think it's called sikhye  Ask to be sure. It was a smooth, chilled, opaque and lightly sweetened drink that we sipped from small bowls. Very refreshing and light. A perfect way to end a meal .

We'll be back to explore the menu further. I cannot wait for next week! I think this is where we'll go before shopping at Trader Joes now."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant run by Ma and Pa. When my friend and I entered, there was nobody there (2 pm). I've done my research on other Yelp reviews and grabbed the menu from the counter. You get to choose wherever you want to sit.  
We were welcome by two great seniors who are from Korea. They are so cute! 

As an appetizer, Mr. Lee gave us a homemade creamy chicken soup. So creamy, healthy, and delicious! Though it was a small portion, I think they were preparing us for the amount of food my friend and I were about to devour. 

We had the Korean Style Family Roll, Bulgogi plate (8.50), Korean stir-fried noodles ($8.50), and beef bulgogi ($15.50) and Fried Vegatables (price unknown) served with a bowl of rice (make sure you mix it). All were so good; we didn't eat everything because we ordered a lot (well my girl did all of the ordering). By the time we were done, Mr. Lee then gave us a complimentary drink. He says it is to help digestion. Boy was he right because my friend and I were hungry after an hour hehe.

While you eat, Mr. Lee would check up on you, make some jokes, get to know you, and just have a great time. He's a great guy who knows how to smile on your face. I've learned that he used to be a chemical engineer and they've been living in the US for 25+ years. He also talks about his wife, which has been a registered nurse for 25 years for both Korea and California; now retired. She knows how to cook healthy, Korean food!

Service: 6/5 Food: 5/5 Check this place out! You won't leave dissapointed!"}
{"text":"All of the five star ratings are spot-on. 

The owner/operators are friendly and really care about food quality, preparation, and service. We had a huge lunch and a lovely visit with Mr. Lee while he and his wife cooked our delicious meal. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very nice host, great service!!!  A small warm mom and pop restaurant, definitely a must when in the area, we had calbi rib, beef bulgigi, jap chae, and bibimbap all were delicious and would order again."}
{"text":"The other reviews say it all. This is a classic Mom and Pop. Just the two working the restaurant Its small, its quaint, and the food is good. 
They won't take a drink order, its mostly self serve out of the fridge. They get busy back in the kitchen so you might have to wait to check out. If these types of things bother you...don't come here. If you are in a hurry, don't come here.

They do fresh, homemade Korean food and its good. We got an appetizer soup shortly after we sat down, and then a few minutes later we ordered galbi, kimchi fried rice, and a shrimp tempura roll. Everything was very good, and plenty of food. 

This is definitely 4.5 stars. They are nice people. The restaurant is very basic, 6 tables and minimal decoration. The galbi was cooked perfect, the meat nice and tender and still a little red in the middle."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place the other night. Small little mom and pop place. Loved it. Genuinely nice couple, great service, and great food. The wife cooks the food herself. Portions were a good size too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What happened?    Did the Lees hit the lottery and leave?    Will miss you.   Tried to come back to visit today"}
{"text":"Since I love Korean food we thought we would check this place out thanks to my fellow Yelpers. 

Husband and wife team, no other servers, no other help.  Husband is a retired chemical engineer from Hyundai.  The Wife is a registered nurse who does all the cooking.  She insists on no MSG and no added sugar.  Nice.  The husband waits on you and chats you up while the wife cooks.  This is a long process since there is no other help. 

There is no liquor license.  Kind of a sore spot for us.  Three stars.  

The TV had Korean telenovelas on which I did not mind and reminded me of Korea, but my husband preferred something else.  It's hard to avoid.  

No AYCE and just single order items.  Banchan is small at first, but they will replace it as you need it.  Good Kimchi.  

Yes, it is nice the complimentary creamy soup at the beginning, but it did not seem to go with our meals and if your lactose intolerant, not a good move. 

We got pork and beef bulgolgi, spicy tuna roll and hot bi bim bap.  All was very good.  All took a long time to cook.   With a toddler, this was just too long for us. 

Absolutely a lovely couple, but not our thing.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant run by husband and wife. Both are very hard working and can cook phenomenal food. They definitely deserve their high yelp review score."}
{"text":"The nicest people and excellent food. Even my super picky girlfriend who hates Asian food loved this place. Older man runs the front while his wife does the cooking. Tastes like you're eating dinner at the home of an older Korean couple. Excellent."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dined in last night for an amazing dinner. Pretty small place right next to Trader Joes. It was a sushi place as others have said. Now its a damn good Korean restaurant. 

You are given complimentary creamy chicken soup upon arrival, which neither I nor my girlfriend thought was very good. The creamy chicken soup tasted of raw flour, but it was free and I cant complain to much. We ordered bibimbop which was pretty good, it comes in a large stone bowl still sizzling. The best thing we ate was probably the pork bulgogi which was also served on a cast iron skillet still sizzling. The pork in the bulgogi was tender and flavorful. The complimentary rice, kimchi, seaweed salad were all very good as well. We ordered deep fried goyoza and i will order steamed next time, good filling, but to crispy. 

There was also a last minute surprise from are server (possibly the owner as well), he threw in some complimentary beef jap chae, which was amazing. I love the thin glass noodles and pretty much everything about this dish. My girlfriend said it was a bit greasy, but okay for me."}
{"text":"The owners were so welcoming and the food was great! They made sure we had everything we wanted plus more."}
{"text":"If you enjoy korean japanese home style cooking...you have to visit this place, very authentic and affordable..."}
