{"text":"The food was good but I think they are a little short staffed. Our order, food, and bill took longer than I would've liked. I don't blame our waitress though as she was slammed. I had the yogurt parfait and it was delicious. The Greek yogurt was very smooth and creamy."}
{"text":"Was so excited to hear that diner deluxe was opening a second location close to home!  I am a big fan of the one on edm trail. However this location does not live up its reputation to the original location.  We didn't have any issues with the service here like others, in fact the service was actually good.  The restaurant is beautiful over looking the pond at aspen landing.  The food though... Doesn't compare to their first location, they have the same menu items but prepared slightly different such as the meat loaf hash they don't do the sweet potato hash and just plain hash and the taste of their other items just don't taste as great.  Kinda blah.   Also don't understand why they would use bottled tropicana oj and charge a premium for it, should be freshly squeezed for the price they charge.  Taking a look at the dinner menu...don't think I would return to try that anytime soon cause it's been Aspenized, too high for too little."}
{"text":"We were long overdue to try Diner Deluxe and last minute on a Saturday three best friends thought today is the day to do so.  Have to say the food was fabulous, served quickly, waitress was very good my only complaint was the wait.  Yes a wait line is a sign of good food but over an hour can make a person ponder moving along.    Was glad we waited it out and would recommend everyone to give Diner Deluxe a try BUT just don't be in a hurry be prepared for a long wait but know that the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Diner Deluxe on my way through Calgary today and damn was I not disappointed. While the wait was a little long, the food was worth it. I had The Best Oatmeal which is truly one of the best oatmeals. I also shared with my partner the breakfast poutine which was surprisingly light.  Overall the place had a good feel, and great service. The only disappointment was the weigh scale in the women's bathroom."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, though not the best Breakfast/Comfort food we've had in the City.  Better to go during the week as it's incredibly busy on the weekend unless you get up early, and get in early.  It was one of the first unique, non-chain restaurants we tried in the city, so always will be good for that, and will remain an old standby."}
{"text":"Seriously incredible. I'm a total brekky fiend and this place is top notch! I got the special: a proscuttio Benny and then got my hashbrowns kurded up. Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Love Diner Deluxe. I only took off a star because since changing management, they have raised the price, and dropped the quality.  Still good, just not AS good as it used to be. Service is always wonderful, atmosphere is great. Everyone is very relaxed, but still professional. LOVE the mac and cheese!!! Never had a bad experience here, just a little disappointed in the drop in quality and raise in price. Doesn't deter us from coming here though. Try going for lunch during the week, avoid the long lines! Sundays are crazy."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on Friday night (August 24, 2012) so restaurant was not terribly busy when we arrived.  Had a lovely salad with beets, spinach, goat cheese and pecans to start....my husband had the lamb shank and I ordered the roast special of the day which was veal with apples and onion, new potatoes and veggies.  When the meals came out my meal was the veal meat loaf so I returned the incorrect plate had to wait for my correct order.  Of course my husband's food was hot so he began to eat his dinner - we waited quite some time for mine to be re-delivered - he had finished his - kind of spoiled the mood, but my meal was also delicious and very well done.   It would have been nice if the server had brought over a dessert to share as a \"I am sorry for the mistake\".  We will return and try the restaurant again as it was pleasant, clean and the food was good and I will be very clear about my choice next time."}
{"text":"We ended up opting for deluxe diner for breakfast as the line up at oeb was half way down the block but after our meal I was wishing we would have waited. My wife had the veggie oh omelette which was so lacking in flavour that even drenched in ketchup she failed to finish it, and the hash browns where cold and rubbery. They only had one option for jam which was a sort of apple spiced compote, which really didnt appeal to either of us. I had the perogie  breakfast special and while I found the amount of food for the price satisfactory, there wasn't anything \"special\" about it. The atmosphere was loud and it was crowded but not lined up out the door at least not at 8 am Saturday morning. the service was OK, but even though the waitress asked how everything was, it was always in passing and we never got a chance to tell her thing where cold. As mentioned in other reviews it is very hipster, so if that's your thing you will love this place, but if not stick to Denny's."}
{"text":"When I think of a diner, I think of comfort food. That was what I was in the mood for the other day, when my lady and I went to the Diner Deluxe for dinner. This casual 50's style diner has a warm, cozy feel to it - it's comforting. But sadly, that comforting feeling didn't translate into comforting food. I don't know what the opposite of comfort food is - I guess it'd be called \"distressing food\".  And that's what the meals turned out to be - distressing. We ordered the Chipotle Pulled Pork sandwich on ciabatta, and a Steelhead Trout sandwich with roasted potatoes and a side salad. The ciabatta bread that held the pulled pork was great, but the pork itself had an odd cinnamon/curry flavour to it that I found distasteful.  The Steelhead trout sandwich was again on really good bread, but I didn't know that Steelhead trout meant \"salmon\".  I'm not a salmon fan, so I suppose I'm the one at fault for ordering it and not liking it.  But it's through no fault of my own that the roasted potatoes were giant, bland and mushy, and the side salad was basically lettuce with a runny bitter cream dressing.  All that said, they do offer all day breakfast, which looked good at the table next to us, and I'm positive they'd made great toast. For the vibe of the place alone, I'd give their breakfast a try."}
{"text":"A few people had been raving about this place for awhile and I finally got to check it out with my family and some friends.  Yes, it's busy, but so are most breakfast joints in the city.  We waited for about 30 minutes for a table, but there was help-yourself coffee and a TV set up for kids to enjoy some cartoons during the wait.    This was the first breakfast I've gone to where everybody ordered something different  (except for the maple lattes YUM).  I ordered an omelet with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese, etc.  It was SO good.  Total quality, as were the potatoes on the side.  Everybody's meal looked delicious.  Everything seems so fresh and natural there, not greasy spoon like so many other breakfast restaurants.   The decor is totally retro and awesome; I dreamed of buying up a bunch of stuff like it for my own house - the Formica tables and the whimsical touches.  The service was great too, from the greeter to the waitress.  I don't know if it's the cute environment, but the patrons were also all happy and friendly to each other - another customer poured my coffee and milk for me at the door after seeing my injured thumb :D    All in all, it was a great breakfast and I can see what the hype is about.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better breakfast spot ls in town, love the omelets and decor. Usually have had great service, but not every time. Expect a lineup on weekends and holidays"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. The staff leaves something to be desired. I'm not really into hipster-type places, so I suppose that kind of taints the experience for me."}
{"text":"Excellent, high quality food but exceedingly slow service. Took them 15 minutes to even acknowledge our presence after being seated and then even though we told them we had a bit of a time crunch (weekday lunch), they took another 50 minutes to bring the food out.  No updates, no apologies and definitely no smiles. BUT once the food arrived we were pleased with the quality, portion size, freshness and taste.  High priced but you definitely get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I have gone to Diner Deluxe a number of times, and it is definitely a must-visit when driving through Edmonton Trail in Calgary. It is often busy, which goes to show that it is a popular spot in the city.   I had the Pulled Pork Hash which was quite good. The caramelized apples and onions, adds the right amount of sweetness to the hash and would definitely have it again. The addition of Philip & Sebastian's is great, as the Diner has partnered with a local coffee shop.   The atmosphere was great, as it really harkens back to what you would expect a Diner back in the day would look like. I even enjoyed the mugs that the coffee came in, as if they just came out of Mom's cupboard.  Be prepared to pay a bit more for locally supplied food though. Sadly, it's common to pay a higher price for locally supplied food, but it's good for the local economy! It does get busy and wait times can be more than a half an hour, check out the little bakery beside it though while you wait.  As a bonus, Diner Deluxe was one of the locations of the movie \"Holiday in Handcuffs\" starring Mario Lopez (AC Slater from Saved by the Bell)  and Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina the Teenage Witch). How can you go wrong?! Haha."}
{"text":"Great brunch food!  Have tried a number of dishes (omelettes, bennys and hash), all were good.  Good value too as you never go away hungry."}
{"text":"One of the greatest places I've set foot in.   They use locally grown ingredients, free run eggs and real butter.   I had the eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and they actually poach the eggs properly. I have worked in a kitchen and I have mad respect for their methods.   This place is worth the line up. Oh and they have free coffee for people waiting for a table.   I'd bring anyone here."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. Potato pancake was great. It was very busy with locals, always a good sign. About 8 blocks from the Delta Bow Valley Inn. Worth the walk"}
{"text":"I don't know why I gave them a second chance, but I did. Today I had to actually walk up to the counter for water and coffee. And it's not like I drink so fast that they didn't have a chance to refill me. They had plenty of chances. I don't know if this location specializes in highly under experienced staff or if they just don't keep people around long enough for them to understand what \"good\" service looks like, but this location is winning the prize for consistency in poor service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service. Only bad part is their switch to Phil & Sebsastian's Coffee - terrible coffee."}
{"text":"Wow, here's an idea: instead of opening a restaurant that has been done to death in Calgary, why not fill a void? Like how about weekend breakfast diners on every streetcorner?!! Yeah!   Well, my suggestion is self serving, because every time I want to hit a breakfast place, I need to stand in a lineup that runs out the door.   Yes, there's something about that Sunday morning hangover that screams \"I need bacon and eggs. And coffee. Lots of black coffee!\" So quietly into the lineups this city shuffles and waits . . . and waits...   Maybe that's part of the fun: the anticipation? The reward? Kind of like going fishing.   Or... maybe there's not a whole lot else to do weekend mornings anyhow.   Whatever: as the start of this review so subtly hints, there could be a fair bit of anticipation as you wait for your food to hit the Diner Deluxe table. That's waiting both at the door (lineup & front entrance), as well as your table once an order is placed. Though as an aside, there is self serve coffee to drink in the lineup to help keep you awake through the process.   Not to be taken as overly critical. Most good breakfast joints are busy like this on weekends.   There's people-volume at this restaurant for sure, but my Saturday morning experience did lead me to believe that while the table service is fine, the kitchen can struggle to get the food out in a timely manner. The server apologized about the wait a couple of times. So one star deduction for a slow kitchen that everyone, including the staff, recognizes.   Otherwise, the product itself is great. Most menu items here contain a bit of a twist on the classic breakfast fare. For example, eggs benedict comes in 4 variations, including beef tenderloin and smoked salmon options.   Our breakfast choices were delicious, creative, and portioned well for t he price. Very satisfying overall.   Looking at other tables' orders, it's apparent you can come back repeatedly, trying new things, and not go wrong. There were some pretty crave-inducing plates, full of originality, all around us.   Be advised, though, that the menu DOES vary by time of the day, and weekdays vs. weekends. For example, there is a \"weekend and holiday brunch\" menu. As well, some diner fare is only available after 11am. So add a disclaimer to the \"all day breakfast\" notion.   As for atmosphere, I appreciated that this places looks and feels like a retro diner. In fact, I wouldn't say it emulates a retro diner. Rather, that's just the way it's always been.   The lighting, wall hangings, chrome tables and chairs--even the kid's highchairs--all are familiar from the small town diners (and grandparents kitchens) I've visited in the distant past.   Overall, the vibe and food is great. It's buzzing on the weekends, and could be a great way to kick start the day, though the delay in seeing your food can slow the tempo up a bit. However, going there any time OTHER than a weekend morning would probably remove any negatives at all"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and they have a lot of unique items. I love the banana chocolate French toast! I would go way more often if they expanded their hours a bit, I have wanted to head over there at 3 or 4 so many times and been disappointed when I remember they are already closed. As another review said its definitely family oriented but I go with my boyfriend all the time and don't mind the family atmosphere at all"}
{"text":"I had high hopes with this place opening but was extremely disappointed from start to finish. We were sat with no menus and had a tough time flagging anyone down.  I had the chicken and waffles and half of the chicken was burnt, rendering it inedible. I took a picture but unable to share on here. I was planning on mentioning it to the waitress but she never did ask how the food was and took the plate away...even though a blacken pile remained.  It was obvious the staff inside and out are new and need a lot of training. But this experienced turned me off"}
{"text":"My favorite place for brunch... by far!!  They have the best Muslix pancakes I have ever tried, really yummy chicken sausage accompanied with really friendly service. The waiting time could be long specially on weekends but it's all worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"This seems to be a trendy \"hip\" place...funky servers, most likely with a tat or piercing or strip of pink or blue in their hair! My friend could not have anything with milk products for health reason and they were very helpful in finding a dish for her....My meal filled the spot but was not crazy memorable. I think the atmosphere makes this placeuniquw  and if I am in the area again I may stop by and try their breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"The food was not amazing! I felt like it should have been amazing and it wasn't . The service was also not amazing, We were there before 3 other people yet those people all got their food before we did. We wil not come back or be recommending this place."}
{"text":"Awesome egg benny. Cool retro attitude. Great food."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast on a Sunday morning here. We got some good recommendations and decided to finally try Diner Deluxe.  Ambiance: Loud-ish music, lots of energy, not too crowded, typical Sunday morning rush of customers.   Food: Ordered the Pancakes and an Omelette. The omelette was delicious. It was not greasy like most places and was stuffed with lots of veggies (they did not skimp out!). The potatoes with it were excellent and salty with interesting squash added. It was a solid omelette dish. The Pancakes were quite terrible unfortunately. I'm not sure why but they were extremely sour (like eating sourdough toast). We asked the server to check to see if the batter was bad or something and she quickly and kindly inquired and said the chef was going to make new batter (maybe the buttermilk was sour?). We could not eat the pancakes so she took them off our bill and asked us if we wanted anything else instead.  Service: Excellent service, which is rare in Calgary. Friendly, attentive, on-the-ball waitress!    Price to Quality Ratio: Not very good. The omelette was not extraordinary, but the price was. For the same amount of money, I could find a higher quality meal elsewhere.   A restaurant is always worth a try. We only tried two dishes, maybe there are better things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Loved how water was served the moment we sat down. Great first impression! We sat out in the patio downstairs on a nice summer's day. Wished there would be a bit more breeze coming through if not for the glass walls. That might make this a nice place to hangout during cooler days in fall or spring.  I was tossing between a Garden Burger or a fish taco. Decided it was a burger day. It was a brown rice party with lots of mustard seed on a brioche bun. Personally not a fan of a brioche bun.. would have asked for a different type of bun, if they have any, next time.  My other half had one of their daily specials: braised beef with poached eggs it a skillet. It has so much in it that the waitress had to explain it twice :) He said it was good but expected the hash browns to be something other than large potato chunks on a skillet.   Overall verdict, a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"I have nothing else to say except that this place is simply excellent. Had breakfast here once and lunch another time and service is excellent and they try their best to be fast. And on that note the only negative would be its packed so on weekends do come early for breakfast or be prepared for the wait. On weekdays come in before 1130am to get quick seating for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Ok i FINALLY found this place, i have drove by it countless times and used my GPS to find it and STILL almost missed it.... im glade i did find it, teh Grilled cheese was great, eth 3 cheeses teh bread ( dont remember what kind) but it was darn good, teh fries were good, could have been a little crisper..  and if they can get Mexican coke  ( retro with REAL sugar   not HFCS) from Costco in the US to serve,  that would be even better and \"retro\""}
{"text":"Looked up this little gem on TripAdvisor.com, and decided to check it out earlier this evening.  The place is pretty inconspicuous with only a neon sign out front to indicate its presence, making it an easy miss if you're not on the lookout. .   Kitschy is a word that springs to mind here. The interior has a retro 50's vibe, typical of a any diner from that era.  I had the veal meatloaf with dijon mashed potatoes, red pepper jelly and pan gravy. It was enjoyable, and for $17 dollars, should have been. I did find the prices a little steep for a 'diner,' but appreciated the quality ingredients that were sourced.  I plan on coming back here to sample some of the other menu fare.   3.5 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"IMHO this is the best brunch place in town! Definitely worth the wait... during the weekends, the lineups can be rather long but fortunately the line moves pretty quickly. Excellent quality food... they used a lot of local products such as spolumbo sausage.  Consistent food time after time, year after year...   One of my favourites is their chocolate-sourdough french toast with grilled banana. They also make a really good eggs-benny with smoked salmon. Another yummy choice is their potato pancake with double-cut pork chop. Their frittatas and omlettes are very good as well. I can't think of anything I've ordered that I didn't enjoy. Their bacon is perfectly crisp. Their coffee is good as well (they serve kicking horse coffee)."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, and that's why there is always a line up on the weekends. I was served some undercooked pancakes, but the staff took care of it ASAP! Love the cozy feeling and the mix and match furniture. THey also offer coffee to you while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"I love diner deluxe. We live close by, but we would make it a destination restaurant even if we had to drive. It has wholesome comfort food but not exactly light food. It's great for kids too, my daughter loves the kids grilled cheese sandwich for $5.75 with real cheddar, nice bread, potatoes and pickles: a steal. I love everything on the menu, you really can't miss here, (Tuesday night TV dinners are fun). Most everything is under $15 for made from scratch food, very good value. Why I give it 4 stars is that the place is small and so you might wait for a table, I've never tried weekend brunch here for that reason, the line goes out the door. And my favourite sandwich, the steelhead trout, was one week so big I needed three hands to lift it, the next week it was a teeny little tea sandwich, I could have eaten three."}
{"text":"I love the hipster vibe to the old school diner look.  The fact that they have pacman is awesome!  Serving staff is nice, helpful, and corteous.  Food came out promptly.  I had the Canadian bacon and tomato eggs benny, it was great!  My boyfriend has celiac and they fact that they have gluten free English muffins is a hard find!  The cafe mocha was also amazing!  The only downsides were the 20 min wait, and the noise level inside (I wouldn't recommend eating in if you are hung over; take it to go!).  I would highly recommend it.   It definitely attacks a younger, more \"hip\" social dynamic."}
{"text":"We tried to get brunch here on a Saturday after hearing all good things about Diner Deluxe. But we showed up at 1:45 pm and were told we had to wait at least 35 minutes. We were in a bit of a hurry and couldn't stick around.  I'm not sure there's a proper system in place for line-ups here, anyway. It seemed like there were people creeping around in every direction and it was confusing as to how or where we should have waited.  If the food is as good as everyone says, maybe we should have stuck around. But I would think if you're the owner and you're bringing in that kind of business, you might, probably, kinda, think about expanding a bit. I know that offends die-hard fans of this place, but I've never heard of a proprieter of a small restaurant business saying, 'holy sweet Jesus, how will I spend all of my money this year'.There's a way that might even bring more in....  I know, I know, how dare I suggest something like this. I guess next time I'll just have to show up like a slave and wait in the rain for an hour to be lucky enough to give them my money for a sample of their wares.....  Also, they should do something about the parking situation there. Threats are posted inside that you'll be towed if you park in the neighbouring Halal Meat parking area. Like that guy has this kind of business on a Saturday...."}
{"text":"Great diner classics are kicked up a few notches here, like chocolate sourdough french toast, and meatloaf skillet with poached eggs (weekends only) that you can \"poutinify\".  This place is perfect for hungry hungover hipsters: barbell mustachioed waiters, kitschy mismatched coffee mugs, and local/ethical ingredients.  The food and patio are great though, and should appeal to everyone.  This is evidenced by the usually considerable wait to get in for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I would definitely say use the reservation app if you want to save some time. I made the reservation and kept my confirmation texts just in case which was fortunate. All I have to say is MASSIVE CINNAMON BUN!!! they were huge, tasty for sure and great. The chicken and waffles was decent but the saving grace was the staff. They are so friendly and so helpful. I would go back just to kick it with them. Appreciated it after a long night shift, good food but better service!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today.  I had to wait an hour but it was worth every second when I took my first bite of the pulled pork hash.  The soft eggs and mustard topping were to die for.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Classic diner food with a modern twist. I love the retro 50's-style decor in here.  I have been there numerous times over the years and the food is consistenly good. The menu has lots of home-style diner options and the kitchen is more than willing to accommodate requests for menu items to be modified within reason.  The only problem with this place is that it is so popular, the line-ups are insane. Once you get in, you will not be disappointed. I'd recommend not going with a big group though, or you may find yourself in for a long wait.  Really enjoy this locally-owned Calgary hotspot."}
{"text":"While we live close to the Edmonton Trail location, we decided to go to this location as it allowed us to make reservations & when you have little ones, that makes the extra drive worth it. It definitely had more of a family feel complete with a play area and accommodations for car seats etc. The restaurant itself is lovely and spacious. We ordered 3 different dishes, one of which we had at the Edmonton Trail location. The 2 savory dishes were good, one was our favorite of all of them (meatloaf hash). We were disappointed with the one we were trying again, the Edmonton Trail location makes it better. Overall the experience was good. If you need the certainty of a table at a specific time and don't mind the drive, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for brunch and always have a great experience! The food is good. We've always had good service. It's a good place to bring our toddler as well with their play area and children's menu. I realize that aspect might not appeal to everyone but for parents who don't get to eat out much in the evenings it's perfect!"}
{"text":"I miss the old Diner Deluxe - the one with cool retro furniture and great home made everything.  Most of the furniture has been changed out in order cram in more customers. The decor and feel of the place has completely changed.  The food is still good but not the great food it used to be. I think I will skip this place next time as memories of the old Diner Deluxe still linger and just make me disappointed with the current Diner Deluxe."}
{"text":"I stand between 'A-OK' and 'Yay-I'm a Fan' for DD.   Don't get me wrong, DD isn't bad, but I definitely did not think that it was a five-star fantastic breakfast/brunch/lunch joint.   -Pancakes were ok -Poached egg was ok but I did end up getting served some odd pieces of foreign food matter with my poached egg ??? I was not impressed... -Scrambled egg was dry, River cafe has fantastic scrambled eggs.  -Hash browns are better at 1886 cafe.  -Drip coffee was good.   I do have to mention that our server was friendly. Also, I did end up waiting half an hour outside but the receptionist did take down our names and it was sunny out so I did not mind the wait."}
{"text":"After hearing many good things about this restaurant and reading MANY more good reviews, when I had my aunt came to visit from out of town and wanted to try some signature Calgary food, I thought, why not try Diner Deluxe. Boy what a good choice we made.   Like everyone else said, the wait can be long but in that area, its not to bad to have to sit and wait. The decor fits the theme of the restaurant to a tee. Very retro and diner-esk. It did LOOK pretty crowded but it did not feel that way.   First thing that won me over was our server. VERY nice gentleman (and very attractive too. it took us 15 minutes to decide what to get cause we kept staring at him) He was also very helpful as my aunt could not decide what to get so he gave her a few suggestions.   I did notice we did have to wait a while to get our food, but considering how busy it was, the wait did not bother me too much (only a little because I was pretty hungry) I opted for lunch as opposed to breakfast, so I have the classic burger. It was really good and meaty. Defiantly not a frozen burger. My aunt tried the bacon/cheese filled french toast (yes i said bacon/cheese filled) and my mom had just a regular breakfast. No complaints about the food were made."}
{"text":"We ended up at Diner Deluxe because the wait at Over Easy Breakfast was 45 minutes (at 10am on a rainy Wednesday!) and it turned out to be a very happy accident indeed. DD is a charming diner in the traditional style full of kitsch and chrome sets. Despite the restaurant being very busy the service was fast and friendly. We tried the eggs Benedict (loved it) and the whole wheat quinoa pancakes (also very tasty). Portions were very generous. I'm not a fan of Phil & Sebastian coffee (too sharp for my taste) but I think most people like it.   It cost over $70 for our party of 3 (including tax and tip) which isn't cheap for breakfast but it was a very nice experience so I would definitely still recommend giving DD a try."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and since i'm a HUGE breakfast person, I couldn't resist. I was there at around 9:30 a.m. on a Friday morning and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Surprisingly, I stuck around and waited - most likely because I was pleasantly distracted by the nick-nacks hanging from the walls and sitting on the table tops.   The service was fast and friendly and the coffee was hot and fresh. I ordered the omelette and my boyfriend ordered the fritatta. The omelette was delicious, thanks to a generous filling of sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and feta. The fritatta was a little underwhelming, but hearty. I have to say that the menu of pretty standard breakfast items does not justify the price, but it was overall a satisfying meal. I do wish there was a substitute for their home fries because they tasted almost like boiled potato pieces. No crunch and no flavour.   Fun atmosphere, but the food is nothing to write home about. It looks like the stuffed french toast would be the thing to try - looked amazing."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Diner Deluxe. It was delicious. Service was great.  Cool diner atmosphere. Parking is a bit of a challenge in that area but that's to be expected. The food was expensive - that's my one knock on the place. if the prices were better it would have gotten a higher rating."}
{"text":"I've always had a soft spot for any place that serves all day breakfast.  Diner Deluxe is one of the best places for breakfast food...actually, just one of the best places period.  The awesome decor, friendly staff and most importantly the amazing food will only entice me to return again and again.  The last time we went, I had the pulled pork hash topped with a couple of poached eggs.  It hash itself was great, cubes of potato topped with well cooked pulled pork.  I requested the eggs to be cooked medium and they were done perfectly.    My partner enjoyed his bison burger thoroughly with a side of potato, bacon and leek soup.  The maple caramel latte is highly recommended!  It was done with just the right amount of maple and caramel flavours that complimented the coffee without being overly sweet.  Would definitely be heading back to Diner Deluxe in the near future!"}
{"text":"(The review begins after spending a half hour trying to find parking in the area.)  The food was the only decent thing about this place, but not decent enough to make up for how lousy everything else is.  We waited in an extraordinarily long line to get seated. It was so crowded I needed to shuffle my chair out of the way constantly in order to avoid being shoved or elbowed by other patrons going to the bathroom or the servers (and not once did I receive an \"excuse me\" or a \"sorry\" when I was jostled by a server.) Not to mention its so crammed in there its next to impossible to hold a conversation without having to shout. Finally the food arrived... Well, most of it anyways. One of my party didn't receive his food until about 15-20 minutes after the rest of us.   And the moment we appear to be done eating the staff gave us the bums rush.  Maybe if they cut back on the amount of tables so the place would be something approaching comfortable, I'd really enjoy this place. As it stands, Diner Deluxe is an awful experience. They just don't have the infrastructure needed to handle the amount of people they cram in there."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for Sunday brunch...We were told a 45 min wait that turned into an hour and 15min wait. The food and coffee were delicious but by the time we were seated I wasn't really hungry for breakfast anymore. The lunch items are very limited. The place is small with limited tables. Better for two people. Anymore than that, we had three, the tables aren't that big."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Like the strawberry ice tea a lot!! The staff are nice but prepare for at least 30 minutes wait."}
{"text":"This is where it all began for my hubby 14 years ago? (And at a fine dining resto)....started off as a dishwasher while attending cooking school, worked his way up to be offered his own kitchen to run but turned it down and to go back to school.  *a long time ago* In an effort to impress, while I was waiting for his shift to end, the cook (my boyfriend) served me \"Montreal Smoked Meat.\" This homesick twenty something stared at the fried meat and just about cried. Since then, the menu is a little more accurate. Just a warning though, MTL smoked meat is not fried!  *Current* We ate dinner here weekly (years after he left for school and new owners took over). The food was consistently really good. I especially liked the veggie burger.  *tips* - Try a weekday for breakfast/brunch/lunch unless you are ok to wait (expect line-ups).  - If you are noise-sensitive, avoid weekend brunch or bring ear plugs! - Super cute place for a weekday breakfast/lunch/dinner or dessert date!"}
{"text":"I gave them a second chance, but still no cigar. I came here with my mom for brunch. We were sat pretty quickly, which was really the highlight of the meal. It took a good 10 minutes before a waitress came by. We asked for coffee, which was brought promptly and we put our order in. Good, right? Well, we waited nearly half an hour for our food, and the entire time we were there, we were never offered a refill of our coffee. Come on, you're a diner! Coffee refills are pretty standard in diners. Our food finally came, and it was decent. But when she dropped off our food, the waitress said, \"I'll be right back with your hashbrowns\". Well, she never came back and we never got our hashbrowns. We waited another 10 minutes after we finished before she came to clear our plates. We told her we never got the hashbrowns, and she said, \"Are you sure?\" Well, I wouldn't be saying that just to clown around. At least she did the right thing and took them off the bill. But, it is still clear that they have major issues with their service. I know it's normally 'three strikes, you're out', but I'm not even going to bother a third time. Getting service here is like pulling teeth and when I have brunch I want to relax and enjoy myself, not constantly having to crane my neck looking for someone to acknowledge us. Sorry Diner Deluxe, I'm sticking to the Belmont Diner in Marda Loop."}
{"text":"Time to shut down if no one cares.   Tried Diner Deluxe in Aspen tonight for the first time. No trouble getting a reservation for two on a Saturday night even though I didn't book until after 4 pm.   Restaurant about 3/4 full on main floor when we arrived. Very courteous server and she was prompt to greet us and get drinks going. Nice setting and ambiance.   Then the trouble started. My meal was brought to the table and the wait staff said my wife's meal would be right up......five minutes......ten minutes.....and finally her meal shows up.     Her halibut was well over-cooked and the bed of spaetzle was burnt on the underside.   In short, the server tried to set things right, crediting two drinks and my wife's (un-eaten) meal from the bill. She can't make enough concessions in order to get us to return.    It's a shame.  They obviously spent some money on the place and the clients would have no trouble accepting their prices if the kitchen was efficient and the food was good.   Watch for a \"For Lease\" sign on this location shortly after the new year."}
{"text":"I shared the Cajun chicken burger which was the special, and the veggieburger. I would say that both were okay, but with the side, it was a fairly small portion for the price. We also ordered the banana split and the crème brûlée which were fine, but again quite small portions for the price.  I think we were a bit thrown off by seeing a fella at the table over order an enormous macaroni and cheese, so we expected something pretty amazing and filling.  The ambience was relaxed and pretty cool, but very smoky!"}
{"text":"I love Diner Deluxe, especially their wonderful eggs Benedict with sausage. My wife had the huevos rancheros, and we both enjoyed our meal. It was an overall great experience, but i found the wait times a little long, but that is no knock against the business, they have great food and they must have just as many fans like me! Good job and we look forward to our next Saturday morning breakfast in May!"}
{"text":"Their food is great and their staff is friendly. Parking isn't always the easiest. My biggest issue is they've apparently changed their hours and now close at 3 or 4PM. I used to eat dinner here, they have a great vegetarian burger. It's really a shame. While I love their breakfast as well, I think its a shame that their dinner is no longer available."}
{"text":"I was headed over to crescent foods to buy some syrup so I could make pancakes myself at home, but they were closed. So I decided to treat myself to a breakfast at Diner Deluxe.  I have been in a few times before, sometimes for espresso at the coffee and gelato bar at the front. I was seated at the hightop right away, it was uncommonly quiet, but I have never been in on a Thursday after 9am. Mel was my server, very lovely gal, and I ordered the DD Pancakes with blueberry which were so great. These folks take great care in the food that they prepare, I notied a good blueberry to pancake ratio. I couldn't finish mine and had to take some home. I had no trouble paying with a credit card, didn't have to get up and go over to their POS like at some places. I live in the area and I like going to dinner deluxe over OEB any day because it is easier to get in, feels like a comfortable place, and because of their food. Tip: Expect to wait a little to get a seat most days. I also like their pulled pork hash. Questions: There decor reminds me of Boogies, I wonder if they are owned by the same people or if they have similar business history in the area. I have never seen any baking for sale in the front, despite having urban baker in the name, do they still do that?"}
{"text":"Newish owners are awesome, made us feel very at home. It was the first time we'd done dinner there and I really enjoyed the slightly more relaxed atmosphere. Plus their pork is Regina's, thanks for the local happy pig option!"}
{"text":"I am an avid diner deluxe goer and was excited to try this new location. The store front doesn't do it justice!! It's such a beautiful location, way more seating and a patio with an excellent view. I had my fave eggs benny (Canadian bacon) and they definitely made it more refined. So fresh and delicious! The hash browns to accompany the dish were a great side as well. The service was prompt and delightful and the ambiance was elegant yet comfortable. We will definitely be coming back here soon!!! Such a lovely treat minus the wait of the other location :). Oh and the coffee is excellent too! Best breakfast I've found in the city- they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I just freaking love them. I LOVE their pan fried oatmeal with lemon curd so so so yummy. Great service, great food. Doesnt get better."}
{"text":"Salmon egg Benny was very salt. Fish was not fresh.... coffee was like drinking hot honey water?"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN TOWN! I've been to Diner Deluxe a few times and it never disappoints me. The atmosphere is wonderful, the people are friendly and the food is amazing!! It has that '50's diner feel to it and the food is more 'home-made' than you find at a lot of places. It reasonably priced too so it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg. If you go and there's a wait.... wait, it'll be worth it I promise. I think this is going become a regular 'goto place' for me."}
{"text":"Why the hell can't I find a diner like this in my neighborhood? If I lived in Calgary I'd definitely be a regular here. Retro-chic diner decor and a menu to match. Comfort food with a hip, urban twist. Had the veggie burger and a salad. The burger patty was made from scratch with chickpeas, onions and who knows what else. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Diner for quite afew years, and honestly I find that since they have been on the Food Network the service is slipping but the food is good so I keep going back. That is until today.... I had a friend visiting from out of town and divided the Diner Deluxe would be a good place to go for Brunch. We arrived at roughly 10:30 and there was a line up, the Host told us it would be 15 to 20 minutes, so we gave him our name and sat down, he kept coming and call ing people but we kept waiting. At one point he came and was calling out names and I said, our name for two. He ignored me and kept on his way.  After close to an hour of waiting, He came back by us and we noticed on his list that our name had been crossed off, again he ignored us, so I said to my friend, let's just go. I'm sorry will never return."}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary for five years now and only JUST checked out Diner Deluxe! I know, I'm a disaster! I still have to check out Boogie's Burgers too...oh man!  Anyway...  We were a party of seven on a Sunday morn after church, which meant we waited about half an hour for a table; but that's still not too bad for such a great place! I had the Fritatta, which was very deliciously hot. The chocolate sour dough dish that Sarah ordered was AMAZING, thanks to some great bread from the neighbouring Urban Bakery.  The only reason this place gets four stars from me is the MENU! There are no names for dishes, just lists of ingredients. When you name something, it gives it character and distinction...just a thought though.  All in all a great place to hang for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Food was good but not worth the wait for a table. Over an hour and then served coffee for 15 minutes longer before ordering. Should consider reservations. And utilize outdoor tables! Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere: without an early reservation you either won't get in on a weekend, so, my advice: reservation early in the morning if you want to go on weekends as the atmosphere is so good that people tend to stay for a little while after their meal, despite the polite reminder from the staff that there's a lineup at the door.  You won't regret your experience!"}
{"text":"If you're the kind of guy who likes regular sugar in your coffee and not brown sugar (even if they try so so hard to convince you it is regular sugar), if you like the Blackfoot truckstop diner, the zellers diner, a good old place where you can sit and have a cup of coffee and a waffle (without chicken(which is impossible at diner deluxe)) than you should rate this place 1 star"}
{"text":"If you're not here shortly after they open on the weekend, you can expect to wait but they provide free coffee to those waiting and the number of people waiting attests to their worthiness.  The service is amazing and I've never left the place satisfied. My go to favorite is the YYC breakfast but there are too many great choices to list here."}
{"text":"John Catucci wasn't kidding when he said \"You gotta eat here!\"  The decor and atmosphere are super cool and retro. The service was excellent and friendly. I was extremely pleased with the food and the portions you get for what you pay. I got the Classic Breakfast because I'm boring sometimes, but believe me, it was far from boring. On the contrary, my breakfast was beyond tasty and piled on high, unlike most breakfast joints. Luckily, the wait time was not long at all when I went, but I don't doubt that it gets line-up-outside-the-door busy. Definitely a cool little gem in the NE!"}
{"text":"Got the Mac n cheese (Alberta cheese curds, fresh tomatoes, cheddar, spinach, garlic bread crumbs, basil, and cream) and the bacon wrapped meatloaf skillet! Oh, and the lunch poutine. Everything was so good. Savory and cooked really well. I want to eat here every day."}
{"text":"The $18 eggs benny should have blown my socks off. Instead, I left feeling... meh. The lineup was ridiculous. I will wait in line for an awesome dining experiencing, but Diner Deluxe was not worth it. There are better places to grab breakfast for much less and much tastier fare. I gave them two stars... one for the lovely fresh farm egg, and one for the biscuit (which was way too small, however)."}
{"text":"Meal ok.... but service has room for improve. Start waiting time to be seat....  You must have a reservation if not be prepare to wait for ever...."}
{"text":"We tried Diner Deluxe for lunch on a Saturday. Loved the retro decor and the laid back vibe of the restaurant.   I had one of their the burgers-very tasty and fresh. I ordered the yam fries but received the regular fries instead. They were very apologetic and offered to exchange them but I said no. The regular wedges were pretty good although in the end I would have preferred the yam ones.  All of our meals were hot, fresh and plated nicely. It was a great place for a leisurely lunch (they aren't the speediest at service but I think that's because most of their menu is made to order from scratch and the place was packed).  Its not the cheapest for what you get but I feel the prices were fairly reasonable (at least for what I ordered)  There was a bit of a wait for tables and they won't seat you till your whole party is there (fine in the summer but would suck in the cold weather as there is no where to wait inside really).  I would go back if in the neighbourhoods as there seemed to be a lot of interesting choices on the menu that I'd like to try."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Monday, so the crowd was pretty small.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  Comfort food with a funky twist.  The weekly special nights seem really fun.  All of their drinks are local.    The diner has an over-all kitchy retro feel that I just loved.  The lyrics to Socrates (winkwink) big hit \"Chatahoochie\" really gave me a laugh.    I think there is some kind of secret rule that everyone who works there has the be the most adorable.  They all looked like little hipster models.  And everyone was so unbelievably friendly.  As soon as my husband checked in on foursquare, he got a coupon for a free coffee that he raved about (apparently it's a local brand and it's very tasty), and the owner of the diner tweeted him asking how his meal was.  THAT is how you use social media for your business."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Diner Deluxe on September 1st and sat outside on the patio.  I ordered the burger with aged cheddar along with an brewed iced tea.  The service was good as well as the food.  I would have to try another item and it would need to be very good in order to give Diner Deluxe a 5 stars rating."}
{"text":"Tried it multiple time in the last few years. Food quality is always steady. Really enjoy the interior decoration of the 50-60's. My wife's favorite is their lamb chop and I always enjoy their cooked to order steak."}
{"text":"Service was bad- I understand when a waitress is busy as I have years in the service industry myself. Not once did she apologize. When I finally had to get the manager to take our food order after a 20 min drink time he was also very unapologetic. Upon billing we recorded still no apology or discount or even free coffees. The food was good- so small note to the staff and manager, all it takes is a genuine apology for upset customers to feel better and appreciated. Won't be back."}
{"text":"On September 23rd  we went for brunch at Diner Deluxe.  Cute place, cute location, not-so-cute waiting time. We were told about 30 minutes and 1h10 minutes later, we were sat.  These predicting skills would have given this Diner and less-than-deluxe review had it not been for our server who rushed the food and brought our bill right away. (Since after double the waiting time, I was in a hurry.)  I am not sure I have been to a breakfast place that has estimated their waiting times this poorly before.  My advice? Simply grossly over-estimate the time. If your patrons get in earlier, you look like a hero. Another nice touch would be to level with the people who have been waiting longer than quoted to let them know \"it'll be a just a little longer than expected and would they like any coffee?\"  Otherwise the food was good. Typical diner-style. Similar to all the other places in town.  If you live near this place it's a nice little breakfast joint; but go on a day when you have an afternoon to kill, and perhaps bring a snack.  T."}
{"text":"What a cozy space, complete with amazing comforting diner food. The service is great (our server made us feel right at home!), and I think this would be a great place to bring out of town company. I recommend giving the soup a shot if it intrigues you at all - the soup of the day when I was there had amazing flavour. They also have wifi, which I love - ask your server for the deets. Expect a line up on the weekends."}
{"text":"Veggie omelette was amazing. Even the toast was extra good. Had to wait about 45 minutes on a Sunday morning, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"So I got to hit Diner Deluxe for breakfast finally. It has been on my list. A tough one to hit since I don't leave downtown often. The top of the hill in Bridgeland=the country haha.  Any way, I went during the week, late morning and got in right away with my good friend. We were sat at one of the community high tops. Community tables are always amazing. They add to the experience. The fault with these ones is they are so close together. I was on the end of the table and the guy next to me had a bladder the size of a peanut. Not great when you are barely awake and a little hungover.  That was quickly forgotten when the coffee showed up. Phil & Sebatians in random mismatching mugs! Love it. Nice touch. I tell you the details count. Any coffee would have been great in my state of being, but this was great. The food arrived and it was delicious. The egg yolks were that dark 'quality' colour and tasty. I had a breakfast with pulled pork and eggs. I can't remember the name so I just tried to find it on the website. Wow low quality, unlike the food. I wish I could tell you the name, but I can tell you it was delicious and had pulled pork. My friends dish was equally delicious. The atmosphere and room were that of a trendy diner with personality and the room was packed. Very cool. When the server was around she was very accommodating. She just wasn't around much. I watched her for a while and noticed that this was because she wasn't anticipating the needs of her tables. Again, once she was to the table she was kind, through and accommodating. It was silly things like not asking if someone wanted cream and sugar with their coffee, thus creating an extra trip to a table.  If the minor service issues, the space between the community tables and the online menu get fixed then Diner Deluxe is a solid 5 stars for breakfast. I need to do lunch and review that as well. Definitely going back to the 'country' to visit this gem."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really, really do, but after a half-dozen pretty miserable experiences, I think I have to add it to the list of places I will not return.  Service is hit and miss... we've had some terrible servers, and also some, like tonight, who were really rather pleasant.  Unfortunately, pleasantness does not make up for an hour+ wait for food.  The vibe in the restaurant can only be described as anxious... every table around us seemed on edge... it didn't help that there was an inordinate number of small children in the restaurant, all no doubt starving and getting crankier by the minute.  Now, I can put up with a long wait, if the food is good, but I'm sorry, it's just not.  I've tried breakfast, both sweet and savoury, lunch, dinner twice and dessert, and nothing I've tasted has lived up to the hype.  Tonight's meal was not even mediocre, just plain bad. Save yourself the wait and the money and head  to Boogies Burgers a few doors down."}
{"text":"This is a great diner!  They serve Phil & Sebastian coffee and the latte I had was one of the best I have ever had in my life.  This is not an overstatement...it had foam so thick and creamy it was like butter.  The food was fresh, yummy and the selection was fun and varied.  My partner had the pulled pork has and the mouthful I had was amazing - I'm not a pork fan but will be getting that dish next time!   I had the veggie burger which was huge and v. tasty.  Service was cool also - attentive but not too much.  Went for brunch on a Monday an there was no wait - worth the weekday visit if line ups make you sad."}
{"text":"Food was great with lots to choose from, and not very greasy. The space is beautiful especially downstairs(there is an elevator) where there is a nice view of the lake/pond. Service is quick and staff are very friendly. Definitely recommend stopping by here for brunch!"}
{"text":"I meant to leave a nice review of this lovely little place when we visited this past summer, but I've been in a deep depression because I can't get their breakfast poutine anywhere near my home. I appreciate the mugs of coffee offered while guests wait, and the George Michael lyrics on the menu marquee made me laugh so hard. Our waiter was super friendly and gave us so much advice on Banff and Jasper National Parks and even threw in some amazing muffins on the house. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"There is often a long wait but with great free coffee to ease the transition, waiting can be okay. Usually the food is great. Occasionally it has been over seasoned or served cold. They have been gracious when something has been off and corrected the problem. They have some fun and very tempting high calories items that I fear would leave me in a carb coma - so I have not yet tried the famous lemon curd oatmeal and other such items.  I have not been for awhile because of the long wait."}
{"text":"We were seated at a smaller section upstairs. They brew Phil & Sebastian coffee! I got the country skillet special which had poached eggs, hashbrowns, and sausage sort of in a mash with mushrooms. It was delicious! This location does take reservations until a certain time for brunch and it can get busy. Book early if you can!"}
{"text":"noisy expensive mediocre food with bitchy wait staff"}
{"text":"Yummy hot breakfast made with local ingredients. Excellent Phil & Sebastian coffee. Great service."}
{"text":"What a great place! First time coming and the service was great, food was outstanding and so quick!!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food and service were both exceptional! There was a bit of a wait but was well worth it. Had the special which was a bacon grilled cheese benny, healthy portion and came with diced potato browns. Our waitress was full of jokes and gave us a lot of attention for how busy it was. Prices were a little high but not to crazy and well worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for breakie today.  I ordered the Rosti with maple chicken sausage.  The Rosti was very good, nice crisp outside and soft inside.  Loved it.  My biggest complaint was \"what\" I got for $17.  A rosti with a fried egg on top and 1 sausage.  The sausage was plenty of meat, no complaints there.   But nothing else on the plate.  Not even an orange slice or a piece of fruit.  I guess I expected something more for $17.  If I had paid $12-14 I would have left very happy and been back.  But I won't, because for 20+ bucks for brunch, I expect more."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place.  Calgary's west side desperately needs a breakfast spot and a casual, family-friendly restaurant.  (A real food restaurant, not the mass-produced garbage of the chains.)  We were disappointed.   The hashbrowns?  Frozen grocery store pellets that have been reheated.   The fruit at breakfast?  Mostly melon (even though we're in peak summer fruit season).  But the bigger problem?  The fruit has that gross aftertaste that comes with factory-cut fruit shipped in from somewhere else.  (Identical to those Costco and grocery store precut fruit trays that miraculously stay \"fresh\" for days.). This stuff clearly comes from Sysco, not a farmers market.   What else is pre-processed?  Who knows.  Those two items jumped out at us, so I'm sure there's more.   That would all be fine if this were a Denny's. But Diner Deluxe claims to be high-end, fresh, and chef-crafted.   At about $80 for breakfast for four, it's not worth it.  They need to up the quality and live up to what they claim to be.  Don't re-sell us processed junk from a factory."}
{"text":"I'm giving Deluxe an extra star for its coffee and service - oh goodness, where have you been all my life Phil & Sebastian?!?!?  I was actually on my way to OEB and got lost.  Found Deluxe and thought to try it for its outside seating.  I always on the lookout for the best Eggs Benedict and while this one was good, it doesn't come close to a 4-star.  The stuffed shredded potatoes with chicken sausage were interesting.  Overall good food.  As mentioned though, based on taste, this would be a 3-star but due to the service as Phil & Sebastian's coffee, it got a 4-star."}
{"text":"I didn't get much shuteye last night so a friend offered to 'feed and water' me in hopes that I'd be able to take a nap afterwards. We headed over to Diner Deluxe.   The place radiates a diner vibe, with corresponding diner prices :) The food is pretty good, as is the atmosphere. I've been feeling protein-deficient, so I ordered the veggie burger ($10.95). It was tasty, and I especially appreciated the Dijon Dill Mayo that was smeared on the bun.   Our waitress was super friendly, but the place was a little too packed for me. I don't like to be immersed into crowds of people first thing in the morning... that's more of an evening thang ;)   Either way, a 'more than decent' brunch joint in town.   Check 'em out."}
{"text":"went on a friday afternoon and had the following (pulled from their online menu) based on a recommendation from the waitress:  Seared steelhead trout sandwich with lemon caper mayo & gouda cheese on sourdough  dang. it was good. really good. the lemon caper mayo is amazing, and it compliments the trout so well. only thing was that the trout wasnt really \"seared\" as the menu described, as it was cooked all the way through. oh well. still really good.  also, went here a few months ago for brunch after doing a 10k run. eggs benny. good. although the wait was really looong."}
{"text":"Any place that gives you a cup of coffee while you wait is A-OK in my books. Service is super friendly and helpful, food is great and well-priced. My favourite is the potato pancake with a side of pulled pork."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a few weeks, but stupid Christmas got in the way. Anyway. I went to this joint with my sullen thirteen year old. Thought I'd take the little freeloader out to lunch. I hadn't been there in forever, so my recollection was foggy, at best. The freeloader had eggs benny with bacon, grilled tomato, and arugula. That came with chunky hash browns. Pretty classic, but with a basil hollandaise. Yarm. The little jerk wouldn't let me taste her benny, but judging from how fast it flew down her gullet, it was a two thumbs up. I managed to sneak a couple of hash browns without getting a fork in my hand - they were great. I would've had more, but I'm old, and my reflexes aren't what they used to be. Now, I'd like to discuss what I really came on here to talk about: the rösti. Gentle Jesus, meek and mild. This thing is like, ninety seven pounds of pure, unadulterated deliciousness. Pro tip, get yours stuffed. Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, right? But I'm getting ahead of myself. This is *like* a traditional rösti, as much as Kent Monkman's landscapes are *like* a Bob Ross. Picture this, my hungry friend; a (shredded) potato pancake as big as your head, all crispy and brown around the edges, rather like it was trimmed with the shoestring potatoes from my misspent youth. It's smothered in the same velvety hollandaise as the benny, and topped with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, the yolk of which was pure golden, super silky lusciousness. When I pierced this beauty with my fork, gooey melty cheese curds oozed out. So far, fantastic. BUT, nestled in this gooey crispy indulgent extravaganza are bacon lardons - meaty, juicy, salty chunks of bacon that has done some serious work on itself. I think the French must have some sort of lifeline to the culinary gods. But that's another review altogether. Needless to say, I finished that whole monster all by myself. I felt like a late life Henry VIII after, but it was so worth it. Service was great, (I can only drink decaf, and our doll of a server made a fresh pot, just for me) and there was a super hot dude in the kitchen. All told, it was magnificent. I'd like to go back every day, but I'd have to roll myself home."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere, you have to love a place that gives you coffee while you wait for a table and is attached to a bakery. If you don't have a lot of time, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I started going there back in 2002 or 2003 with the ex.  He knew the owners at the time, Dwayne and Alberta and they were always so hospitable.  I never once had a bad experience there.  My favorite meals were the mac n' cheese and the gouda stuffed french toast.    I loved the retro setting.  I loved the staff's casual funky look.  I loved the food.  If this review was based on all the times I went there when the past owners had it, it would definitely be 5 stars.  However, my last trip there was nothing short of craptastic.  We(myself and my daughter) walked in and were told to seat ourselves.  There were three other groups there before us.  Our orders were taken and then all the groups ahead of us received their food.  While waiting 4 or 5 other groups came in.  I watched as three of those groups got their food before us.  All we had ordered was an eggs benny with no hash browns and toast to substitute and a child's order of french toast.  I saw someone else  that had ordered after me get their eggs benny.  Ok.  Odd.  How hard could french toast be?    By the time the 4th group got their food before us the waiter clued in that I had watched all this unfold and came over with an excuse about the kitchen having trouble with something.  This was after about 30 mins(I was watching my time from my foursquare check in which I did not do immediately upon arrival).  He then went over to the cook and put an order in.  I suspect it was ours and that we had been forgotten.  After 45 mins plus of waiting we finally received our food and the order was wrong.  There was no toast, but there were hash browns.  After waiting for over 45 mins my order was wrong and my daughters french toast was almost cold.  I was so upset with how little service we got that I tweeted my displeasure the entire time.  Once we were done we didn't even get a bill.  Waited a bit and then went to the counter to pay.  I found the food mediocre and not near as delicious as I remember it from before.    Would I go back?  I doubt it.  I had many twitterers recommend some other places to try out, but maybe someday I'll give it another chance as I spent many other wonderful times there previously."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Glad you are able to make reservations online. If you don't you will have to wait awhile. This place fills up fast. Service is good and food comes out fast. I really like the coffee here and recommend the potato rosti, smoke salmon Benedict and the egg white fritatta"}
{"text":"Popular place for breakfast. Food is comparable to any other breakfast place though they have a bit of variety on their menu. The service has dropped down quite a bit. They definitely need more servers when it gets busy. Expect a waiting list on the weekends"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Finally, a place that dares to be different.  Service was great, food is fantastic and atmosphere is quirky and fun!"}
{"text":"Don't go hungry on a weekend morning 'cause you'll be starving by the time you're seated! No fault of the restaurants, it's just a well loved place. Great food, fun atmosphere, friendly people. The attached bakery is a wonderful place to pick up fresh bread if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Legit New American/Canadian Traditional American/Canadian Diner Food! Is that a category of food that actually exists? If so, Diner Deluxe has it fairly well nailed. This retro-esque hip spot has a menu that reads like a hangover's cloudy-but-good dream. Items such as a chorizo, egg and aged white cheddar sandwich, southwestern breakfast wrap, perfect benedicts, savory French toast, bacon, red pepper and cheddar omelet, pulled pork hash and more bless a menu that doubles as a one-way ticket to the cardiac ward. And the most awesometown option? Poutine-ize your \"hash browns\" (us Yanks will know them as home fries) by adding aged white cheddar and hollandaise.   Anyone who knows me knows that even in a strong-willed moment I cannot resist an offer of anything that even smacks of poutine. So it was with much gusto that I ordered the bacon/pepper/cheese omelet with poutine-ized home fries. My dining companion opted for my initial choice, the pulled pork hash with poached eggs (and the only reason I didn't order the same was so I had some hashers to poutine-ize (I really like this neologism: poutine-ize).   Of the two options, the pulled pork was clearly a winner, but the omelet was a decently close second. Both were delicious, and the accompanying coffee was strong and plentiful. Laid back atmosphere, really tasty food, and enough hearty options to grease the skids. Take that, quadruple mojito I had the night before! You ain't got nothing on this.   I look forward to returning on future visits... if only to try the grilled grapefruit. And maybe that delicious-sounding breakfast sandwich (even though it is on ciabatta)."}
{"text":"We went here once for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious so we drove down from Innisfail on a Friday night to have supper, seeing as how they're open late on Fridays. The special was amazingly tasty, with freshly hot homemade buns, as was the burger. If you're looking for a great little spot that's different from the franchises, I'd highly recommend the Diner Deluxe"}
{"text":"Sure the decor is cool. But the food is mediocre, the coffee is bitter, the service is average, chairs are uncomfortable, and it's as noisy as possible when you want a quiet Sunday morning breakfast. Not my type of place."}
{"text":"We frequented this place for both lunch and dinner. The diner uses the bread from the bakery next door so everything with baked good is excellent. I really like the pancakes that had muesli and the chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll. Everything is delicious. This place is a must stop in Calgary."}
{"text":"We definitely loved this spot.  Great, healthy, fresh food, nice, strong coffee and incredible service.  We didn't wait to be seated, and our server was at our table right away and constantly to check on what we needed and how everything was.  The decor is great, a classic diner with some future ideas and a ton of satisfied and happy customers.  Job well done, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I generally go to restaurants for the food, not the service. The food here is pretty good! The first time I went my boyfriend and I each got a sandwich with a different side so we could split both dishes and see what it was like. I had the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries, a dish I would return for any day of the week, and he had the pulled pork with regular fries; the fries were really good and the pulled pork was in a tangy sauce. He liked it more than I did, I prefer a sweeter sauce.   We went back yesterday and each had the Stampede breakfast special. Keep in mind this was an $18 special. We got a large ramekin of \"rosemary\" hash browns - where the rosemary came into it I'm still not sure - scrambled eggs with cheese and green onions, 2 slices of bacon, 2 pork sausages, and 2 pancakes that tasted and had the look and mouthfeel of the mass produced Bisquick kind you get at free Stampede breakfasts every two blocks at this time of year in Calgary. Yes hash browns - I have a lot of opinions about these - looked like deep fried tofu nuggets and didn't really taste like potatoes. Considering that only the meats and eggs were really worth paying for, I wouldn't have spent more than $12 for this meal.   Then there's the service. I will go to a restaurant with good food and terrible service; I'm going to be fed after all, not pampered. There were two waitresses that I saw working - we were on the main floor - and neither of them were particularly keen on helping us. One was basically just running up and down the stairs - she was probably working with the diners downstairs, so that's not an issue - and the other girl who was predominantly upstairs, didn't seem to want to interact with the diners at all. For us, we got seated and then had to wait for her to come back with glasses and cutlery. After a while she returned and offered us something to drink. I got a mimosa - not something I'd repurchase - and then we had to wait for her to come back with water. She made eye contact with us twice throughout the whole experience, and neither of those times was when we were ordering. She watched herself pour the water and rearrange things on our table as she took our order. She acknowledged me significantly more than my boyfriend for some reason - he swears he doesn't know her, so I doubt it was something personal. After the meal she offered us the check and then promptly took fifteen minutes bringing it. THEN, after we watched her bring a debit machine to the diner two tables down, she announced that \"we can pay at the front on our way out.\" To top it off, we stood at the register for five minutes while the girl from downstairs walked past us twice before offering to ring us through.   Overall: the lunch food is good enough that I will go back, but someone needs to give the servers a crash course in basic customer service and time management."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last week, but have not been in a few years.  Not sure if it changed management or not.  It is unfortunately no longer open in the evenings for dinner which is too bad.  They used to have the \"best-ever\" slow cooked lamb shank ever!!  Breakfast was very average.  With so many fantastic breakfast options, new and old to chose from in Calgary, I don't think that the retro decor or the long lineups cut it anymore..."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast/brunch place. Had really good coffee as well. Also, gluten-free friendly."}
{"text":"Any place that sells breakfast all day is an automatic must-go-before-I-die (or before I get some disease that prevents me from eating anything tasty). Therefore: a visit to Diner Deluxe.  The oatmeal comes in a square? Seriously? And the ketchup in tiny little bottles! Not only does the quirkiness of the place (there's a tree growing in the middle of the joint) manifest itself in the dinnerware, but the food is GOOD. My friends had the maple-baked oatmeal with lemon curd and I had the forest mushroom omelette and we were all happy enough to die. And it didn't hurt our student budgets too bad, either. Subsequent, absolutely necessary visits may break the bank though."}
{"text":"We have a great Father's Day brunch.  We arrived a couple minutes before our reservation time and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was lined up to the door. The  coffee flow was endless and our order was taken and served without a hitch. As always, the food is tasty. All tables were full, but there was no push to get customers fed up and out. It was relaxing meal."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times and the so so rating has more to do with service than the food. Yesterday a couple people in our group had the healthy Parfait which looked great. The granola chunks were the size of golf balls and were very hard to breakdown so basically had to plop the whole thing in your mouth. Portion was a very healthy size and very tasty. I had the Classic breakfast and was vey pleased. The soft poached eggs were done perfectly but the rosemary hash browns were a bit over done. Overall very tasty. The only complain we have is the service. Our server Jordan was great in being attentive, prompt and checking back on us if we needed anything. It was just the food took a long time getting to the table, probably 45 minutes. This seems to be a common theme every time we have been there. Don't know if it's the kitchen setup or lack of cooks that results in slow meal prep. There are lots of servers so that part of the service is great."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe just isn't the same since the original owners sold. I've noticed that the prices have gone up and the quality of the food and ingredients have gone down. Long gone are the sun dried tomatoes in the mac and cheese and the lovely forest omelette, replaced with just a diced up pedestrian tomato. The homemade jams were such a treat, now replaced with your regular, packaged jams. All the special touches seem to be lacking. The long waits continue but you know what, there are better options out there. Service can be hit or miss as well. Sorry DD, you've changed and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Average food, nothing special, bad cofee"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Actually NO service. I went there on Sunday and was promptly seated by the host, who said the waitress would be right over. Great. I waited-but nothing!  I waited some more, but- still nothing!! I could see numerous people standing around the kitchen area just talking? In fact there were more employees than the 3 other customers in the place.  I kept looking at the waitress', who I knew seen me, yet No One bothered to come over!!! What kind of place is this?  I will NEVER go there again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband I recently enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at Diner Deluxe.  I had read the great reviews and we were not disappointed.  The kitschy 50's atmosphere provided a fun and light-hearted atmosphere.  You've got to love a fridge bedecked with kid's coloring sheets. The servers were very pleasant and efficient.  Refills of our beverages were promptly served.  We both enjoyed our biscuit benedicts, an inventive twist on the traditional benedict, as well as the well-brewed coffee.  But above all I must express my appreciation to owner Dillon for treating us with such thoughtfulness.  We were made to feel very welcome and comfortable.  We have shared our positive experience with friends and we will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and service was amazing. It was our first time here and the girl was very informative and super nice! We got the breakfast burger and fosters banana French toast, the breakfast burger was delicious exactly what we wanted definitely recommend it. The French toast was alright wasn't my favourite, but was still good. Fruit was fresh and juice was fantastic! Definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!! Quite a wait to get in, but easily worth it!! Fast and friendly service, delicious food that is very high quality! Bright and comfy ambience, delicious sweetened brewed iced tea. Great prices and large portions. My dad who usually finishes his food, had to take some to go! Too tasty to leave behind! They have Fiasco gelato milkshakes which are so rich and tasty! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Diner Deluxe and could not wait to give it a try for Sunday brunch. I am not a usual brunch-goer and kind of dreaded the line up but I would not change a thing about having to put my name on a list and waiting about 40 minutes on this beautiful, busy Sunday at 1pm. There is a bakery connected right next door - I LOVE bakeries so that kept me busy as did the complimentary coffee at the door. There were samples of the fresh bread that warmed my soul. YUM! Of course we bought some on the spot (Apple Rosemary Sourdough) as well as a scone, banana bread etc. LOL! So, we were finally seated in what looked like it could be your grandma's kitchen. Loud, warm, homey and welcoming with aluminum tables and mismatched mugs! CLEAN despite the crowd! The service could not have been friendlier. Patience was our waitress' virtue as we had not been there before and had a couple of questions. NOT a place for you if you have a hangover headache, as it is PACKED and the tables are close together but fortunately I felt pretty good this day! More to do with the fact that those days are over for me!!! I went simple with 2 fried egg whites and fabulous multigrain toast that tasted homemade - and the preserves! WOW! Also made in-house and not for sale normally I was told. I really liked the smaller sized hash browns mixed with green onion, seasoned and cooked to perfection. My friend had eggs benedict which she gave a 9 out of 10 (she was not over the moon for the hollandaise sauce but she likes her own that she makes so that could have something to do with it....) The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that we had to wait over an hour for our food. We had a ball talking the afternoon away but we were starving!!!! I got take-out for my husband which was a chicken sandwich with avocado, potato wedges and pickles. He adored it and thought the chicken breast was ample and worth every penny! I KNOW I will be back to this establishment (not to mention the bakery) - and I cannot wait!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Good helpings and best part they had a kids area which made my experience even awesome! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We were the only ones there on a weekday around opening time. So I can't say much about the service, as it was obviously good. Though, being that this is Calgary, it's pretty typical that a new restaurant suffers from bad service initially. Not sure if this would be a problem here.  Onto the food. Huevos Rancheros. Really delicious and an absolutely huge portion (which helps justify the price to an extent).  Great little spot if they can keep the service good. I will be back for sure. Short of a 5 star simply for prices that are a little too high.  Final note: coffee is Phil & Sebastians. If you're into that (like me), then you'll love it. Otherwise, the uninitiated  may find it slightly sour or strong."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat here. I think I will start my review with the fact that I don't consider this place a \"diner\" in the traditional sense. Yeah there are some design cues and they serve breakfast. But the ingredients, preparation style, and price would say otherwise. Unlike a typical diner with it's booths, you might be elbow-to-elbow with other patrons. I don't mind this at all, but others might.   This could have been a 5-star. I have to say it was very good. I just found it to be very expensive for what you get. Because, let's be honest, we're talking breakfast food here. I had the steakhouse hash, which was a bit flank steak, arugula, two eggs, and hashbrowns. This was $16 and I find that to be fairly expensive for the size and ingredients. Bring those prices down and we are in business, this place might be pricing according to its trendiness. And the eggs, again, yes they were amazing. But I expect organic free-run grain-fed eggs when I'm spending the money. Many breakfast places have long since addressed the massive importance of good eggs, so the fact that they are so good is expected.  That said, it was absolutely delicious. I destroyed my plate which was served in a hot skillet. The flank steak despite being a very cheap cut was cooked to perfection. I am not sure the arugula holds up so well when added to the hot mix of sweet potato hashbrowns and steak. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I'd like to see a higher cut of meat in there--save the fatty flank steak for an application where it isn't front and center.  Oh, the pancakes are actually decent value, mainly because they are truly enormous. We are talking 25cm diameter, 3cm thick kinda thing. Huge, fluffy, goey, awesome pancakes.  The service was very friendly and the coffee keeps coming (and is free while waiting in line). Note: if you're not a fan of 15 Kilo (Phil and Sebastian's drip) then avoid the coffee. It has a polarizing taste. As someone who drinks their coffee black, I love it. I find the slight sourness to be a complementary factor. Your experience may vary.  The food itself was served quite quickly, but given the popularity and size of the venue, the wait time was about 45 minutes with around 6 couples and two groups of 5-8 or so in front of us. Not bad or a deal breaker, just plan to wait! Some advice, go as a couple. Your big group will be waiting a much longer time.  In summary: I can't give this place a 5 star, because the quality offered is absolutely expected from this type of establishment, and I still find the pricing on the high side. Don't expect a diner, or you'll just be confused.  Greasy spoon this is not!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, after seeing it on you gotta eat here I had to try it! It was super busy every time I've gone on weekdays so can only imagine what it's like on the weekend. The eggs Benny was amazing and getting hollandaise on the home fries mmmm!"}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe was my #1 brunch/breakfast choice up until my last visit.  I was disenchanted by the decor changes. I know the new owners were aiming for better turn over & #s by adding booths & loads of new tables, but they really cut out some of what was signature atmosphere and appeal for me. At least they could have sourced more of a retro booth design & vintage tables to match the existing furniture.  The service wasn't up to par with past experiences either - so I'm not sure if some new staff is just in training, or what.. but the wait time for food was definitely longer than usual. Maybe this has to do with the increase in table #s.  Also - the trimmed down menu - should be a good thing, but the execution of my breakfast meatloaf & spinach dish --- left me wishing for the old owners... maybe I'm crazy, but I'm pretty sure there was a difference.  Anyhow - at the end of the day this place is still a good breaky place, with a little funk & granola flavor in the decor, servers and food choices. I would still recommend it to everyone. I'm just not sure it's still top of my list."}
{"text":"This is my easiest review for BREAKFAST! This retro decor place is delicious! They dont cheap out on the quality of the food. The servers are swamped but don't worry, your kicking horse coffee will be refilled  Pro:  Tasty Tasty Tasty.  Cons: Long waits on weekends (well worth it) Your clothes will smell like yucky breakfast when you leave.   Fav Items:  Basic Breakfast with Chicken Sausage and Sourdough Toast (add on a side of hollandaise sauce)  Salmon Sandwich with peashoots  They are also open for dinner and on certain nights they have free corkage."}
{"text":"Although I didn't make it for breakfast yet, slipped in for lunch one day and enjoyed a tasty soup and sandwich. Nothing special with either of these (hence only 3.5 stars), but the atmosphere is friendly and funky.  We will try to get over for breakfast some time, as that is one of their features, but there are similar diners opening all the time in the city and may take awhile to get back up there. But if the old OEB is packed or closed, just drift down the street, pass King's and check out DD.  Shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Diner Deluxe with the girlfriend for Friday brunch. So, you pull up in Aspen and there's a small storefront, but don't be fooled, as when we entered and saw the cool little upstairs area, we were brought downstairs into another dining area that was full of seats and lots of light from the patio windows. Bench seats are full of pillows and are really comfy, and you're not packed in, which is nice. Cool space. I had the chicken and waffles, she had the breakfast poutine; we both enjoyed them, except for her eggs being poached way beyond soft, wasn't a big enough deal to send back. Phil & Sebastian coffee was great. Server was really nice, very attentive. We'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out after seeing it on \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Unfortunately the food left me feeling disappointed :("}
{"text":"-1 for what to me seemed like an uncessary long wait time for tables. I GET that theres a lot of people coming here, but observing the table cleaning was just ridiculous. It took 2-3 people to clear tables and it looked like an intricate lengthy Japanese tea ceremony. The Ed-Harty t-shirt guy beside me was blown away and didn't quite know how to react.  Aside from this, Diner Deluxe's food was amazing. I started with the grilled grapefruit with syrup, which was refreshingly sweet (I will be grilling grapefruits from now on!). And had a full meal consisting of a chocolate milkshake, the pulled pork skillet with poached eggs, and two sides of grilled roma tomatoes and maple baked beans on the side. The chocolate milkshake was great and brought me back to the days of Gerrys when they had REAL ice cream milkshake. I also liked how the shake had more of a dark-chocolate tone which brought a soft bitter contrast to the whole meal. The pulled pork skillet was an opus, the pork was thorough in flavour and was well accompanied by the fried potatoes. The eggs were perfectly poached to a gooey consistency, and acted as the sauce to bring the whole skillet together. I had my buttered toast, which was from the bakery next door, with the Roma tomatoes, which was the almost perfect combination, I just wished I had some basil and some cheese to enjoy it. Finally I looked over at the maple baked beans and felt bad for having forgotten it. So I after having a few bites I had it to go and had a great snack at home. A little sweet for my taste, but none of it went to waste.  I would go back to Diner Deluxe again, but hopefully at times when it isn't that busy. We went during Sunday lunch and it was intense. I would definitely like to take a crack at their dinner items."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. If only the place wasn't run and staffed by clueless hipster teenagers that don't have a clue what a restaurant should actually run like. Even the \"managers\" are insanely slow, and don't seem to care that people will sit in the waiting area for 20-25 minutes before staff even acknowledges them.  It's a shame, because the food is almost worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy, so it's nice that there is the option to reserve -but only at Aspen Landing. And unfortunately, even though we reserved a spot for 2... it still took us a while to be seated, almost making the reservation null and void.   When we were seated, the service was relatively slow, but they were pretty busy and our waiter was very apologetic, so there is some understanding there.   The coffee and food is a bit overpriced, but the portions are good. Almost too much, but in a good way. The food is fine too. Nothing extraordinary, but fine.   In conclusion, this place didn't seem overly stellar -to the point where there are long lineups, but obviously they're doing something right!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my family while visiting Calgary. It has kind of a hipster-y vibe and some of the food options are a little different. My fiancee and brother loved the breakfast poutine and everyone raved about the food in general. Service was good and it was a cozy little place. My only complaint was that as someone who is not a breakfast person, I was disappointed that I couldn't order off the lunch menu, especially since they're on the same menu and there aren't any times specified. I wish it had been made more clear."}
{"text":"We've been here numerous  times  and it's always  consistently great food but this time the service  was something special.  Daniel (with black rimmed glasses)  was awesome!  He was so helpful  even to customize my breakfast selection.  He was so nice the whole way thru and truly made our brunch experience  that much more special!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! We had been warned that there would be an hour wait, so planning around that we went earlier to put our name on the list and left for a short time and returned just in time. Keep in mind that if you aren't there when they call your name you loose your spot. There is so many great menu options that it made it hard to pick only one choice. I tried the pulled pork skillet and was so gladI did. It was SO DELICIOUS and definitely made the wait worth while! Add this spot to your must try list and I will definitely be going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"One of my top breakfast places in the city. The food is fresh, original, and tasty. What really sets this place apart is the atmosphere and decor. It has a retro theme to it, but not over the top. The tables and chairs are like the ones your grandparents had, and there is lots of light and a very nice tree in the restaurant.   Try the stuffed French Toast or Maple baked lemon oatmeal.  The owners treat the staff well; everyone is happy and they even sell jewelry of one of the part time waitresses by the till.  Check it out this weekend!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. So far I've been 4 times. The first time I got the basic breafast (eggs, toast, some kind of meat, and hashbrowns.) It was excellent.  The second time I went I had the Meatloaf. HAVE THE MEATLOAF. O. M. G. It's so good!  The third time I went I had the Mac & Cheese. If you could get a half Mac & Cheese and a Half Meatloaf, that would be ideal. They're both AMAZING.  And the last time I went I had the breakfast sliders (If I could marry a breakfast sandwich, this would be it!) and the breakfast poutine. I was a bit dissappointed with the potatoes in the breakfast poutine this time around. The hashbrowns didn't have the sweet potato or carrot or whatever it is they usually put in and they were a bit under-cooked, but overall the meal was fantastic. And I love the concept of a breakfast poutine!   My next visit will be on a weekend so I can try the meatloaf hash."}
{"text":"We've frequently attended Diner D for about 4 years. It's changed in various ways since then and we keep on coming in. Much of the staff knows us fairly well and we have nice visits. Weekends get intensely busy for a reason. It's become a weekend tradition to enjoy a coffee while we wait to be seated. So if you're the type with no time to stay & enjoy a place, try coming in on a weekday to avoid the massive crowds of fans.  Quality ingredients, a healthy atmosphere and a refreshing modern mom & pop attitude make Diner D a consistent pleasure!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but I thought the service was poor. Had a 10:30 reservation wasn't seated till around 11. I had the DD pancakes with chocolate chips , they were really good. Friends had the potato pancake and an omelette and really enjoyed it. Was worth it for the food , I'm excited to try the original DD on Edmonton trail this weekend!"}
{"text":"Every meal I've had at Diner Deluxe has been great. The focus is breakfast with modern twists on classic dishes made with local ingredients.  My favourite dish is the meatloaf hash: two poached eggs, hashbrowns and toast featuring bacon wrapped meatloaf.  Phil and Sebastian coffee is the default. This place gets busy on weekend mornings, so either come early or prepare for a wait."}
{"text":"A place where the java is freshly brewed with care, and where one can substitute a gluten-free biscuit over toast deserves my business!  Ripe with kitsch , but without the diner sass one might have a hankering for, I appreciated the more refined choices on this menu: potato pancakes, pulled pork hash, bennies, omelettes. For me, I was jonsing for a regular fix of sausage and eggs. The sausage was incredibly juicy and plump. You know when the skin kind of bursts when you cut into it? The signal that says I'm fully loaded? Diner Deluxe's pork links do that, on every cut. I ordered my eggs over easy and was a little less than impressed with how hard the yolks were. I suppose I could have specified runny, but to me, runny is just the standard.   Service was sweet, but slow. On a Wednesday morning, it appears that Diner Deluxe doesn't mind if you linger. Many folk were on meetings, some with their laptops up and keys a whacking.   Thanks to Wendy P for bringing me here. I have been waiting a long time to try Diner Deluxe, and can safely say, I'd be jumping up and down for another breakfast here!"}
{"text":"I have 2 words for you: Breakfast poutine.   OMG.... that's all. Fantastic ambience, great service, great food. Do you need any other reasons?? Check it out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Diner Deluxe from the suggestion of \"where to eat in canada\" tv show. It was REALLY GOOD! The breakfast was huge, and it was all very fresh. The wait was long as the place isn't that big, but the service made up for it. The only complaint I would have was that the tables are a bit close together and it was really cold while we were eating, bit it IS Canada, so it's bound to be a little cold in the middle of winter."}
{"text":"The new Diner Deluxe just opened for all the die hard fans out in the sth West. I was living with friends here and it was super convenient to have to only travel to Aspen from Elbow Valley for a burger than all the way across the city.  The style here is more modern cafe, not really diner. Doesn't matter tho, the burgers are still KILLER ! Staff are learning but are very committed, engaging and polite.   The same recipe is in the soul of this establishment the owners have created and it works for me."}
{"text":"The theme here is old school Diner hence the name of the business and the decor and atmosphere are super cool, laid back and warm. Staff are friendly, engaging and professional.   The food was excellent. Everyone in the group was happy. I had a meatloaf which was on a tv show Diner Deluxe was a part of. Very tasty although I do prefer their burgers overall.   Recommend breakfast, lunch and dinner!!"}
{"text":"Ok had big expectations based on the review. Was hoping to get some lunch it was 10:40am , they said no can do. Got the eggs benny they were decent but my hash browns were cold. Seasoned well but cold. Only got one coffee re-fill(coffee) was good. I tried to get the waitresses attention but she was to busy reading the newspaper.  Might give it another shot, but sure wont stand in line."}
{"text":"had breakfast a few times here.  The first time i twas amazing/fresh on a sunday packed out the door linups.   The 2nd time it was nearly empty on a weekday and horrible.  Quality  varies too much, i wont be back"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and none of the times were all that memorable. Although I don't remember anything being terrible, I don't remember anything being amazing either. The only thing I really liked was their vanilla milkshake - soo good! Other than that, there is nothing else that I absolutely loved that made me want to return.  There is parking on the block so it is usually not a problem. The price range is average for a breakfast place, $10~15.   There's nothing about this place that really urges me to go back. There are lots of other breakfast places I'd rather go to instead of here. On the weekend, usually the line up at OEB is out the door so the wait here doesn't seem as bad. It's kind of unfair since OEB is just down the block for competition sake but I guess it is also a good thing since impatient customers make there way here!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to go into this place.   My step mother took me.    Omg.   Eggs Beni.   Heaven.    If you love  breakfast go here!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find, I had the Salmon BLT and it was totally on point and cooked perfectly. My Friends had The eggs Benedict, Veal Meatloaf,and Rocky Mountain omelette, they are all beyond happy with their order. Sarah is a hot friendly staffer that took care of us, the place is a throwback retro style diner with awesome grub, definitely need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you see a line-up out the door, then you've probably found Diner Deluxe. It's fairly busy on the weekends, not bad during the week.  If you want to know the truth, it's worth wait...inside it's like a retro cafe from the 50s - with funky 50s mismatched furniture. There's even a breakfast bar if you're by yourself and want to read the paper while you eat.  The coffee is organic and fair trade - which is important to this coffee drinker...I love the fact that the cups are bottomless. (You can't get that at those high power coffee chains, can you?)  The food is good wholesome stuff - like locally made sausages, eggs and toast."}
{"text":"food is so delicious! had the porkchop with hashbrown. porkchop was as juicy as it should be and hashbrown was as greasy as it could be.  also I had to comment on the atmosphere, which is very classic but doesn't feel old at all! the latte was better than I have expected too, given that it is no coffee shop. of course having a pro barista would be awesome."}
{"text":"I have had great meals here but today's was  disappointing. The service was a new low. No coffee refills and no checking to see if we needed anything. The wait for the check and time to pay was ridiculous. The food was meh but the service is what will keep me away. A $50 breakfast should have better service."}
{"text":"Classic diner look, with a younger crowd. This place has been around forever but never had a chance to try.  We ordered the breakfast poutine and the maple fried oatmeal! Both were delish. The breakfast poutine was hardy and very filling- we added the pulled pork and it paired really well. The maple oatmeal reminded me of bread pudding, so tasty! But more of a dessert and very filling- would of been nice if they offered it as a side for pairing with a savory dish.  Overall, nice diner with good options on the menu. Wait times are long but not as bad as OEB down the road.  Would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Well prepared food.  Good variety on the menu.  Friendly staff.  There were four of us but we ordered three dishes as they looked like huge serving.  Staff accommodated the request very graciously.  There was quite a line up but the estimate of wait time was pretty accurate."}
{"text":"While I normally prefer savoury breakfasts, I always get the baked oatmeal here- because it is so, so delicious.  The lemon curd, baked oatmeal, cream-yum!!"}
{"text":"There are no restaurants that do breakfast better than a home cooked one from your mom or Nana. Until now. If I'm in town, I wait in line because it's worth it. Best breakfast I've ever had in my life. Try the breakfast poutine: you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After OEB next door this might not be fair  Had Cdn eggs Bennie both places. Here I enjoyed it but....  Eggs were almost hard poached.  Muffin was not toasted, just hard, ie very chewy and dry Some of the diced hash was burnt, interesting to add carrots and turnip to the hash though?  Hollandaise was VERY lemony Coffee bitter but with cream very nice, I usually stick to one cup but here had a refill  OK brekky spot but I was not made into a convert."}
{"text":"There appears to be a lot of harshness for Diner Deluxe in it's first month at the new location.  I on the other had had a pretty solid experience there but it was after the lunch rush on a weekday so it was fairly quiet.   I can tell there is still a learning curve there but they are almost at the diner deluxe standard I would expect.  Diner Deluxe's concept is a stepped up version of home cooking and everything I had at the original and my meal here have been darn tasty.  Unless your parents were chefs,  chances are the food won't taste like home because they do rely on some very modern flavours but I do like that reinvented aspect of food when it's done well. The only major complaint about this place is things get quite fatty while they fancy up the homestyle favs and I can really feel that heaviness sitting in my stomach after I eat.  The menu seems a bit different than I remember the Edmonton trail location but I haven't been there for a while but it seems like a bit of a new concept closely tied to the original.  This trip I had grilled cheese, tomatoe bisque and fries.  Sandwich was on thick bread,  the butter they use for grilling must be herb infused because it had a nice aroma to it.   I should have paid attention to the cheese mixture because it was well through out and very good.  The Bisque was alright,  not as creamy as some which is a bit of a good thing when dealing with a rather fatty meal but it's not my favourite.  The fries are well seasoned to the place ketchup is optional.    I almost miss the store front,  it's very plain but the inside was nicely done to the standard of the area.  The new place is huge when you consider the downstairs and the huge patio.  Hopefully that helps with some of the legendary lines of the original.  We sat out on the patio and had quite a nice mix of sun and shade.   I wished there was a better water view but I could hear the fountain and knew it was there at least.  I would return - maybe for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"DD is where I go for breakfast to be taken care of; to be comforted with traditional diner breakfasts, but with uncharacteristic quality ingredients. I'm talking organic eggs, phil and sebastian's coffee, roasted organic grapefruit, etc and now gelato right next door.  There's usually (always on weekends) a wait (20min+) to get a table, then a bit of a wait for food. But nothing excessive, I promise. And they'll load you with caffeine in the meantime.  Of the several fantastic hippster-ish diners in Calgary, DD is my favorite. Although if Dairy Lane, Blue Star, or Galaxy were in my neighbourhood I'd just as well stole into them than drive to DD. They're all home."}
{"text":"Being an out-of-towner, I looked to Yelp for help finding a breakfast place that was local, not a chain like Dennys. Found this place and decided to give it a try. My wife and I were not disappointed. Extremely good food, good service and hopping atmosphere. Definitely a younger generation crowd which added to the energy this establishment has. If I'm ever in Calgary again, this will definitely be a stop on the list."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. Wait times are long. The ambiance is a bit off, very hot and humid, and loud.  I don't think I would go back here because of that."}
{"text":"This was one of my top 3 brunch locations. I loved the real potatoes and yams served with my egg dish. I actually enjoyed the bakery/cafe/pizza served next door. I would buy there chocolate bread and take it home and make french toast with it."}
{"text":"From the outside it didn't look like a place I would go to, but I loved the inside! Really popular, but got seated right away. There menu is healthy with lots of options, but everything was so so good!!"}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe is one of the highlights of my move to this area of town.  Stumbled across it one day and was immediately drawn in by the retro decor.  It's a small place but usually the wait times aren't too bad.  Tried several different dishes there and while they're all good, the Mac and cheese is top notch.  Highly recommend this place.  Only negative thing is that I believe their kitchen closes at 3 on Sunday, which is usually my favourite evening to eat out."}
{"text":"Super delicious food! I had the eggs Benedict and it was the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. It was very busy inside and it's a pretty small place so I would recommend making a reservation especially if you want to go for brunch on Saturday or Sunday."}
{"text":"When I moved back to Calgary a year ago, a friend that comes through here all the time told me that I needed to check out Diner Deluxe. Typical to his usual stellar advice, Diner Deluxe is indeed, the best breakfast place I've had the pleasure to visit.  Take the combination of sub-hipster vintage décor, it's open bustling environment, killer coffee, friendly and prompt service and fresh, lovingly prepared ingredients and you have a recipe for success.   I recommend everything on the menu as well as getting there with some time to spare, for you may have to wait a little bit. Typical wait times are between 20-30 minutes for peak, though I find it usually quicker... so grab a cup of coffee in the breezeway and make chit chat with your party, for it is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but the speed of service could be improved by not allowing the serving staff to eat behind the pickled vegetable wall while on shift serving.   Since the servers are handling food and sauces that are being plated in between sending text messages on their phones. Going from texting on your phone to dropping spoons in the sauces... where's your phone been? I know mine is pretty gross."}
{"text":"A \"must\" visit when in town.  Yeah, the vibe is fun & young but I have brought my Mom who was very pleased with the place.    The door you enter opens into a space that sells Fiasco Gelato (Oh la!  Sample the pumpkin flavour if they have it.) and has a Pac-Man upright arcade game.  If you have to wait a bit for a table - not common on weekdays, probably certain on weekends - grab a mug and go into the 2nd area where there is coffee & the fixin's on the right side.  The only frustrating part of your visit will be when you attempt to decide what you want.  The choices are painfully wonderful and diverse.  Emphasis on local and fresh ingredients.  Everything is good.  Seriously.  Their egg game is on point!  Servers rock!  Make sure to check out the loo.  Can't speak for the men's but the ladies is outfitted uber stylishly."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe is comfort food at it's best. I've gone for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and have always enjoyed what I ordered. For breakfast I recommend the deep fried oatmeal. Sounds weird? Well it's phenomenal. Imagine an explosion of brown sugar, oatmeal, and creamy lemon curd in every single bite. Honestly, try it. It's super good.  For lunch or dinner I lean towards the grilled cheese or the macaroni and cheese. I tend to try macaroni and cheese almost everywhere I go, and Diner Deluxe has one of the best in the city.  For those of you interested in lighter fare, they also have some excellent salads on the menu. I do think, however, they don't compare to the heavier treats--so in my opinion, a person should consider this a treat and splurge."}
{"text":"This place was a random stop here in Calgary. Boy o boy, did it impress us all. All of the options were great, the coffee and alcohol, and service even better. The decor was so cute too! Def come here and enjoy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Calgary. I love going up there with people who have never been or my hetero lifemate Dan Clapson. I generally get the #YYCstampedebreakfast when I go, although this last time I went I got to try a \"secret menu\" option of fluffy pancakes topped with butternut squash, pulled pork and whiskey reduced maple syrup. It was seriously one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth, and I have put many a superior dish in there. Breakfast is my favorite meal and those flapjacks are a serious homerun."}
{"text":"I was back in Calgary visiting some family and friends and was super excited to meet Ro at OEB for some Breakfast. Unfortunately the wait was at least an hour so we walked down the road to try Diner Deluxe. We got a seat at a high table pretty much right away and both ordered the Breakfast poutine. When we got our meals we dug I and they tasted great. Neither of us finished and we thought it was an overall close second to OEB. Until later when we both spent the afternoon sick from whatever we ate. Not a good first impression and I won't go back."}
{"text":"THIS IS WHAT I CALL A DINER!!!!!  There are two ways you can have a dream diner:  ** Strategy A: Go All Out New Jersey With a 1000 Page Menu  New Jersey diner menus are huge.  There is no American or Italian or Jewish or Greek dish they ain't got and a lot of them have Mexican too.  The execution is generally solid if not especially remarkable - but your comfort is that you were given the entire world to choose from.  The Danger of a Bad New Jersey Diner:   The cook is a fleabag and the dish or the ingredients have been sitting in the back for a long time.   Leftovers for dinner again?????  ***Strategy B: Go All Out Legendary Execution on Rediscovered Classics   Ok, the Menu is normal sized, but the food is so good!  There is an excellent cook. Not only are the classic dishes resplendent, but there are lots of innovative touches, and new dishes the cook has come up with.   Your breakfast or your dinner is wonderful, marvelous, fantastic.  The Danger of a Bad Legendary Execution Diner:   Pretentiousness.   \"Our landmark gastronomic establishment serves locally sourced eggs signed by the chickens themselves, locally sourced spinach personally tested by Popeye, and locally sourced sausage made from the meat of consenting pigs. Customer, remember you are having the AUTHENTIC NORTH AMERICAN DINING EXPERIENCE.\"  There is a financial aid officer to help you with the tab.  ...............................................  Diner Deluxe is a superb superb Plan B small menu great execution diner.  And there is not a drop of pretentiousness in the place.  They even make fun of other pretentious la-dee-dah diners such as OEB which is one block away.   Diner Deluxe has a white board offering gag items such as $1000 Financier Caviar and Champagne and $800 Trust Fund Kid 100 point wine.   So Diner Deluxes' heart is in the right place.  How is their cooking?  OMG. Totally totally OMG.  My wife had an eggs benedict for the gods, with the most orange yolk on a poached egg I have ever seen, and an absolutely perfect firm non-runny but not hard boiled texture. Mild restrained hollandaise sauce that had no touch of the kill-the-flavor-of-the-rest-of-your-food-with-loudmouth-hollandaise that is generally the curse of amateur benedict makers. A very classy touch was flash sauteeing the capers in butter - which takes the acid out and makes them mellow and remarkable.  I had a wacky three ingredient breakfast and hit paydirt three out of three times.  A tomato bisque off the lunch menu was pure tomato magic with cooked in subtle garlic and herb flavors.  Maple sugar beans (yeah these are weird pairings) - were totally original and avoided all of the flaws of bad home-made diner beans. Unlike the soupy, overly wet, overly sweet mush that passes for baked beans in most places - these baked beans were dry dry dry. There was no sauce. The beans were firm and had strong bean taste. AND they had a subtle touch of sweetness that came from an absolutely restrained use of maple syrup as well as the savory heft of well-cooked-down tomatoes. An absolute triumph of a dish!  But the star of the show was what they call \"a parfait\". This is yogurt, and flavored mascarpone (kept separate on your plate) along with a good homemade granola and fresh good northwestern mixed berries. Mix together and eat.  What set this apart from a standard yogurt granola and fruit combo you get at the grocery store was  a) a very restrained amount of yogurt, so the dish stayed firm and solid.  b) flavored mascarpone to give the yogurt freshness and interest.  c) super-high quality fresh berries.  It was like eating a creamy berry pancake.  I was in heaven.  The coffee was fine.  The crowd was young graduate-student-y and cool.  (The handful of older folks in the place came accompanied by adult sons and daughters. The oldsters all looked like global warming researchers.)  Service was friendly and excellent,  and the prices were very reasonable.  You have paid far more elsewhere and gotten far less.  Diner Deluxe is an absolutely solid six-star must-visit establishment!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, YUMMY!  We loved this place. I had the eggs benedict with ham and hash browns and the dining companion had the burger with yam wedges.   I could taste my fresh (organic?) egg, and the hollandaise sauce was homemade. spot on. Small portions, for price, again that is the style here in Calgary, but Delicious with a capital D. My \"eggs\" consisted of one \"egg\".  Very tasty!  Burger came with bacon, and was delicious, well seasoned, cooked excellent, thick, just small size. Flavor was out of bounds good! ( I tried the burger twice).  Restaurant was busy, service was good, and we were seated at the counter after being asked if that was fine, and yes, thank you for asking, we were fine with sitting there, meaning we didn't have to stand long for the wait.  I sat by the kitchen, and I had a delicious full view at the quality of the food these guys were putting out in that small kitchen with a huge turnover of Calgarians, and let me tell you, I was impressed.  If the portions were larger, ie, two eggs in my eggs benny and a larger burger, I would have given this restaurant a PERFECT score. Alas, Calgary, we need to keep the pressure on the restaurant owners to step up.   I am a fan of Diner Delux, and they are going to bee on the food network Dec. 6/7th.  Keep up the good work, put out larger sizes, and I will be there2- times per week.  K"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not disappointed.  It is a true diner layout and feel and was incredibly busy.   The servers were friendly and very quick, and before we were sat, they brought over an orange juice to drink while we waited for seats to open up.  The great service continued after we were sat.   I had a craving for some breakfast food so I settled on the chorizo and spinach eggs benedict.  About 10 minutes later, the chefs in the open kitchen had our food up.  Very impressive considering how busy it already was.  The benedict itself was hot and fresh with the sausage and spinach stretched across the English muffin with beautifully poached eggs and a mellow and tasty hollandaise poured on top.  On the side were homestyle chunks of hash browned potatoes with green onion and seasoning.  The whole thing was delicious and very satisfying for my hunger demon. I will definitely return to this jewel on Edmonton Trail."}
{"text":"Chaos reigns on a rainy Saturday morning. Chose this for the ability to make a reservation as I had to be some where. Got relegated to the basement level which was full of families with vocal kidlets. It really was more than my friend and I could bear. One Benny was perfect the other cooked to firm which we should of sent back but just wanted the hell out there. No coffee or refills offered, had to ask. And the Phil & Seb coffee was so strong and acidic I felt it burn a hole in my gut. Can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING breakfast.  Fresh, GF friendly, accommodating and a great 'feel' to the place.  I'll definitely go back when I'm next in Calgary."}
{"text":"I love Diner Deluxe.  It has a great atmosphere, food and service.  Breakfast is great but did you try them for dinner? It's worth it!"}
{"text":"We've been to Diner Deluxe about a dozen times. The food is always great, but the servers are always very busy. Sure Diner Deluxe is worth many 5 start reviews but as a restaurant the serving staff should concentrate on giving their guests a friendly experience. We found that because they were so busy, little things would be forgotten and when they came by our table it always felt rushed."}
{"text":"A sign of a good restaurant is when you see people lined up out the door. Such is usually the case at Diner Deluxe.  This was my third visit to this restaurant and just as before, I was very impressed. I took my dad there for lunch. My dad is a tough customer and a very picky eater. Even he loved this restaurant.  For my lunch, I had their Turkey clubhouse wrap (Guac lovers brace yourselves) with their tomato soup. My dad ordered their chicken sandwich (or burger, can't remember). The food was great!! Diner Deluxe's food tastes like a home cooked meal that you would get at your grandmas place. They also serve soda that is made at the Bear Paw in Canmore. A black cherry soda was the perfect addition for a delicious meal.  Aside from their fantastic food, one of the things I love about this restaurant is their decor and the overall vibe of the place. It is very retro with old signage and an open kitchen concept. Great place, great food, great vibes.  I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"We went early on Saturday. It started to get pretty busy by 11am and people start lining up by then.   The food was pretty good overall. However, they had no tissue in the female washrooms and their doors don't lock. I understand when the servers tried to prompt customers to leave when there's a line up, but it is definitely inappropriate when when someone was still eating the fries. One of the male servers can multiple times 45 minutes in to our meal (not including the initial 15 min wait time for ordering etc.). Not even once did our server came back and ask how our meals were going or offer to top up our teas. And as soon as I stopped, he came back to remove all my utensils, napkin and plate. So I was left napkin less, with an oiled mouth/hands, and still trying to finish my tea (without a spoon to mix the cream and sugar). I expected better services for the $50 we paid for our meals!!"}
{"text":"We came mid-afternoon and really enjoyed our experience. My husband had the pulled pork hash with poutine... YUM!!! I was definitely jealous, but grateful it is a huge portion so we saved some for breakfast tomorrow! :) I had the Good Morning Burger, it was really yummy but extremely messy (the yolk and hollandaise kind of exploded in my hands) which made it a bit difficult to savor and truly enjoy. When we come back I'd definitely get a hash again, they do an amazing job with their potatoes!! I like that they offer a selection of fairly regular breakfast/lunch options as well as some more foodie/unique alternatives, like their breakfast poutine or the PB & J french toast which was a special today.  It's nice and brightly lit by the big windows at the back of the restaurant. There is some seating upstairs but don't fret if it's looking full--the downstairs portion of the restaurant is HUGE and has tons of tables. There's even a little spot for kids to play and they offer a kids' menu, so a big plus for families. They also have an elevator so the downstairs is handicap accessible. Overall, it's nicely decorated and I like the ambience. They have quotes from Dumb & Dumber on the stairs which is a fun, quirky touch! :)  One thing that would take this place from really great to fantastic for me is if they had homemade jams and homemade ketchup to go along with the rest of their fairly gourmet breakfast options. Our server was polite and very quick, but seemed a bit agitated. Other than that, they definitely offer a quality take on brunch that I look forward to enjoying again ASAP!!"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing special, you can cook a better meal at home. The service was not great and the food was terrible.  We had the huevos rancho and the omelette.  The ranchos was nothing more than an egg on tortilla chips with greasy chicken.  I asked for an extra egg in in my dish and instead they bring it on the side.  The omelet was over cooked and dry.  You got to try real hard to cook a dry omelet.    There is lots of room for improvement at this place.  We would not go back again......it was that bad."}
{"text":"Honestly loved it here! Great set up to accommodate kids, huge portions, yummy food and Sarah gave us super fast service. Prices are typical if you want good food. I'd come back here to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Mmm... Diner Deluxe. Even the thought of it makes my mouth water. I am fortunate enough to live really close to this little gem, and it is always my first suggestion when someone comes to visit me.   The decor is kitschy and adorable - most of it is refurbished vintage finds that the owners have carefully arranged in order to create a little time warp in the restaurant. It truly feels like you've gone back in time to the fifties diner you always see in the movies. Even the bathrooms play with this theme. The crowd is diverse - everyone from indie kids to business men to new-age hippy mamas from the yoga place next door. Parking is hard to find, though there is a small lot in the back.  First, let's deal with the food: Diner Deluxe does breakfast like you wouldn't believe, and it does it all day. Any variation of gourmet breakfast is yours - pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, they even have this oatmeal stuff that I have never tried but my friend got and it looked healthy and delicious. This is not Denny's so everything is made up fresh. The kitchen is kind of open so when you go to the bathroom you can peek and see what breakfast delights they have cooking up. They put new spins on those old breakfast favorites.  If you're planning on going for brunch on the weekend: beware. DD is a small restaurant, and they often have a huge lineup from about ten to two. Expect to wait at least twenty minutes, often a lot more. Go early if you can in order to enjoy a more leisurely brunch, but if you've slept in just grab a snack beforehand because it is definitely worth the wait.  Diner Deluxe is not as recognized for its dinner menu, which is kind of a shame. They play with the diner theme, making gourmet and delicious favourites like Mac'n'Cheese and some of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever tasted. Their yam fries are the fourth best in the city. DD also has an amazing wine selection and their virgin drinks are to die for. They play with spritzers and lemonade and the drinks are always served appealingly in jars.  The best part is that Diner Deluxe is very reasonably priced considering the quality of their food. Definitely grab some friends and come check out the great service and tasty food, as it is always a fun place to visit."}
{"text":"You can sum Diner Delux in about one word: hipster central. We weren't even planning to go for brunch as my other friends were planning to eat at 10:30am on a Sunday for some brunch. Call me crazy but I've never been the biggest fan of the brunch crazy because a) lineups are always insane and b) hipster overload.  Alas, my friend took a bullet for us and waited it out to grab us a table. Be prepared to wait for an hour if your coming on a weekend.  The place is very eclectic designed and has some hilarious, old school signs. Zillion dollar benny anyone?  There were six of us so we each ordered our own dish (missing two dishes): - Stuffed french toast ($15) - thick cut apple flax sourdough, brie, bacon, and rosemary syrup. This was actually a huge plate, you won't be hungry after eating this. The stuffed French toast was sandwichesque but way more fluffy and delicious. The bacon, ham and brie went surprisingly well with French toast, which was unexpected.  - Huevos rancheros ($17) - jalapeño-lime chicken, red peppers, salsa verde, cilantro sour cream, and corn tortillas. Comes with a side of hash browns and my sis opted out of the eggs and got extra ham instead. I had a taste and it was good, with a slight kick from the sauce. - Chocolate banana french toast ($14) - dark chocolate, cranberry sourdough, and caramelized banana. This was my second choice - Mascarpone french toast ($13) - multigrain, mascarpone mousse, mixed berries, and preserved lemon.  Overall, the food was good. If you're a brunch fanatic, this is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared to wait if you go during prime time baby."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe has always been one of my favourite weekend brunch places, but last weekend's experience had me leaving sour. Everything was going nicely (very friendly host), until I found a long piece of hair in my meatloaf hash. I get it, things happen in the kitchen, and I'm totally fine with that because hair his hair and it will fall out.   I brought this situation to my server's attention, to which her response was \"Hmm.. Do you want another one?\"... well sort of, I don't want to brush off the hair and continue eating it. It was kind of an odd question to ask someone, most restaurants would have offered to replace it instantly.  When my server came back with the new dish, she placed it in front of me and walked away. Neither an apology nor an acknowledgement that the hair inconvenienced my experience was uttered. She looked at my friend as if my friend was supposed to say something. It was just very standoffish. I felt like the hair in my dish was an inconvenience for her. I was appalled and lost my appetite after that. To top that off, nothing was offered on our bill to compensate for our poor experience.  The hair found in my dish didn't change my views about diner deluxe, but the attitude I received definitely comes into play the next time I decide to go out. I don't think I'll be visiting anytime soon. I rather go to a place where friendly and helpful servers are available."}
{"text":"Amazing chow here. Anyone visiting the Calgary area, this is a 'must go to' food place. I had a breakfast here today, as my first visit to the Diner Deluxe. Had the potato pancake with 2 eggs and charizo sausage, coffee and a side of the lemon...same as lemon pie filling, which is fab. Great service and friendly staff throughout. Thanks folks. I shall return."}
{"text":"Very nice cozy place! Excellent staff, friendly and attentive!   The food is fresh and tasty. The hash browns are good with out being greasy."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Went for a late afternoon brunch. Seated right away. Got the potato pancake with chicken sausage and scrambled egg and was not disappointed. The chocolate banana french toast looked good as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group on a Sunday for brunch. It was sooo busy that we were advised to split up the group to 2 tables. It was fine.  I will have to say the staff are really friendly and upbeat. The only real downside was our server.  She took extra extra long to take our food order.  I really think she was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of customers at one time.  The food came out fresh and hot and was really quite tasty!! :D  They offer free range eggs, almond milk lattes/cappuccinos, Phil & Sebastians roast coffee.  I had a latte & it was strong and full bodied. It was a nice tasting roast.  I had an omlette and it was gigantic!!  i could barely finish half of it.  The hash browns were very good.  Nothing was overly greasy at all.  I realy like their multigrain toast and their special blend jam.  They offer other unique drinks as well.  I also had a Cora's lemonade strawberry iced tea.  Very sour as Cora's lemonade is a concentrated lemonade mix.   The decor is of a 70's diner and the furniture reflects that.  They are kid friendly and offer high chairs.  I would definitely like to come back.  The waiting area isn't huge and on a nice day waiting outside is kind of nice!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to Diner Deluxe for her Birthday. Waited 30 min for the table (you'll be glad to know they take reservations). Then at the table waited 20 min while many staff rushed around us offered the people behind us without a reservation coffee and cleared a lot of tables. The Hostess came down the stairs took the menu off our table and came back up as we were leaving to have Breakfast elsewhere! Awful Awful way to start your Birthday!"}
{"text":"Had an unexpected day off so I took my boy out to play for a bit and then we stopped at Diner Deluxe before I dropped him at school.  We were here at 11am and only ended up waiting about 10 minutes for a table.  I had the Diner Club (had bacon in support of Passion for Pork week) and my son had a simple plate of scrambled eggs & sausage.  I had not enjoyed a coffee yet that morning and was looking forward to having a cappuccino at the diner as I had done in the past.   Imagine my surprise when I was told they no longer make those kinds of coffees and only serve regular.  Like really?  Very disappointed and wondering why when they are so busy during breakfast/lunch.  In the end the food was good as always & service staff delightful.  Really wish they wouldn't have removed those coffees from their menu however as that is part of the breakfast/brunch experience for me :(.  Next time I will stop at my usual coffee place before we come here.  *Also I did check in here and it shows on my phone yelp app as a check-in, but is not showing up on my home computer app as a check in.  Bizarre."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe is just what it states it is, a deluxe diner, set on the Edmonton Trail and right next door to the Urban Baker.    Be prepared to be flung into the time, as the interior decor is all 50's.  Chrome tables and chairs, 50s lamps, and 50's island tables that surely came out of some Jetson episode.  There is a great mismatch of retro coffee cups and teapots here even the high chairs that line the hallway to the bathroom are authentically 50s.  The restaurant was not busy today which is from what I heard a slight miracle, so there was a really nice chill atmosphere to the sounds of 50's lounge music in the background.  Staff is very nice here and they tried desperately to get the permission of the owner to take photos of the restaurant; first she said yes and then she changed her mind and said no.  I don't really understand this idea, don't you want your restaurant to be known and isn't any publicity good especially if it is free, whether it be by word of mouth or via a review.  I mean it is a compliment if someone finds your place interesting enough to photograph it.  Enuf said.  Let's stick to the highlights then; The Menu.   Seems there are tons of breakie reviews here so I will concentrate on the supper menu.  The supper menu or \"Classic Mains\" are around 17 dollars and all the offerings sound so delicious.  The Macaroni has sun dried tomatoes and basil, pesto and white cheddar.  Grilled New York Steak has caramelized onions, and potato wedges. Lamb shank has horse radish and Dijon, root vegetables and mashed potatoes.  I myself dove into the Meatloaf which had Dijon and mashed potatoes, pan gravy, and red pepper jelly. Yummy!  From beginning to end you are taken on a gastronomic voyage, it surely is worth the visit, and is I imagine a huge icon here in Calgary.    I however take out one star for the hesitancy to promote what you have been working for, plus I was treated with such suspicion. Looks like other yelpers have done it anyways."}
{"text":"Can I choose six stars? This place rocks. There are two scenes at this place...the packed high energy breakfast crowd (best breakfast you'll ever have btw) and the lights dimmed, come and chill out for awhile dinner. Every night of the week has a different special, and within that theme the choices change from week to week.  I decided to take my hard to please dining companion ( aka Mom) on Taco Tuesday. We had an AMAZING chicken burrito with some sort of chocolate sauce...it was subtle and genius...the chicken just melted in your mouth. Sides were great too.  I'm so impressed that I meet my husband there for dinner the next night. I'm in scrubs after work but feel more than comfortable in this laid back environment. The same hip and friendly waitress from the night before is there again. She's obviously having fun, serving food she knows is awesome.  My husband has 'the best pulled pork sandwich of his life'. I hate pork but try some and yes it's friggin great. I kept it light that evening with yam fries and a salad. The portions are still huge and there are small touches, like house made dip for the fries. No sauce from a plastic vat here! I'm so interested in the yellow hot sauce on our table that I have to try some. It's sweet and flavorful and then my mouth is on fire. Try it if hot is your thing.  Overall, the best casual dining experience I've had in Alberta."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. Went there for brunch, food quality was Meh... The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't wow either! The only thing I liked was that they get your number and send you a text message with the estimated wait times (75 minutes in our case!)  There are better options in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. Kitschy diner-style ambience, great staff, impressively varied menu, excellent coffee, and well prepared egg dishes. Worth the typically lengthy wait for a table."}
{"text":"I love the retro feel of this place and the wall of plates signed by local yyc celebrities is fun.  I have to admit though, I'd choose Over Easy Breakfast (OEB) down the block over Diner Deluxe 9 times out of 10. I just find the overall quality of  food is a little lower.  Still a great place to go (especially if the OEB line is too long)."}
{"text":"The Poutine breakfast starter was one of the top 5 breakfasts I've ever had! Poached egg over beautiful poutine .... Unreal! The strawberry peach jam was awesome as well"}
{"text":"Fun spot with funky decor - a bit of a wait (20 mins or so) on a Saturday morning, but enough space to do so.  We shared the fried oatmeal - a really unusual preparation and delicious. The pancakes with quinoa were fluffy with a nice bite: huge though. Stuffed rosti was truly special - very good and also pretty original. Chili cheese hash was also good - not spicy. The huevos were also very good - a lot of potatoes though!   Each of us enjoyed our meals and the service was friendly and timely. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place is the bad-ass of diners. Expect to wait in a huddle with other patrons on weekends, even on the coldest darkest days of Calgary winters. Doesn't matter how early or late you go, there's always a wait. They won't let you die though, they always make you feel like you are on the verge of dying before they will tell you a seat is opening up soon. But they will serve you a coffee to save you from hypothermia. Bless their hearts.  When you do get seated, you get a healthy selection of breakfast, lunch and alcohol options. Double shot of Baileys in your office you say? Can do! Steak for breakfast? Why not. They probably butcher the cows themselves in the back too. All of the menu items are sized for beasts, because, you know, this place is bad ass like that. You can even get some yogurt and granola too if the other stuff intimidates you. Even though they are balls to the wall busy, they never shortchange the service and hospitality. If you want your meal customized, just ask and they are always happy to accommodate.  Just know that you will always leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"I love Diner Deluxe in Aspen.  As a mom with two preschoolers, it's really nice to have a quality place to eat where I don't have to stress about bringing my kids - not that I think kids should be running around or yelling in any restaurant, but it's really amazing to not have to worry about normal kid-volume and to have a kids play area while they wait for their food.  They have quality food (my favourite being the corned beef hash) and I love the gluten-free options for the celiacs in our family... also we love Phil's Coffee!  Seems like the upstairs is reserved for adults without children and the downstairs is for families.  We have always had great service too!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in the north of Calgary that has some particularly amazing gelato! There is definitely a 1950's rustic feel about this place and I love the garage door as part of the decor. I would definitely come back to this place even though the service wasn't phenomenal - it kinda seemed like it was run by a 14 year old. Oh well, it's so cute!"}
{"text":"There has always been a special place in my heart for the classic diner serving up comfort food and nostalgia, visit after visit, plate after plate. Perhaps it's the friendly conversation over a hearty meal, or maybe it's got to do with grandma's vaulted recipes that some diner restaurants excel in executing perfectly. I feel as though Diner Deluxe has the classic feel of reminiscence down to a tee.  Unfortunately - and I'm quite upset about it - an aspect of the dish I had for brunch at this little hole-in-the-wall left me quite unimpressed and I am unlikely to return for another visit.  Prior to walking in, I took in the sights of the neighbourhood, a hip stretch of Edmonton Trail worth exploring. The ambiance and décor of Diner Deluxe is totally retro, with faded vintage cigarette and soda ads and old rusted license plates on the walls, counter stools, and blue and red cafeteria chairs. There is a splendid patio out front for prime people watching. A server greeted me with a faint smile, but minimal enthusiasm. In fact, the service was consistently more mediocre as the dining experience progressed.  Having not eaten for twelve hours, I decided on the BBQ Pulled Pork Hash Skillet, which consists of a saucy pulled-pork-and-caramelized-onion medley and two poached eggs on a bed of hash browns, topped with a a scoop each of apple relish and grainy mustard. The menu hinted at toast being included with the order, but for a buck or two, I managed to substitute it for one of their house-made pancakes. The eggs were flawlessly poached; the oozing yolk creamy and hearty. The pulled pork was honorably average, not too juicy and with little happening in the way of flavour coming from the sauce. Nonetheless, it was edible and the meat was slow cooked. What I enjoyed was the addition of the relish and mustard, adding layers of texture and flavour with each bite - very satisfying! All that having been said, one ingredient ruined this entire meal and my experience at this quaint little diner - the potatoes. Half of my hash was comprised of day-olds. If you've never experienced it - and make no mistake, these were not just overcooked, or they'd have been brown - fried potatoes from yesterday taste like you're chewing on cardboard. It was absolutely disgusting! The mystery is that half of the hash was cooked fresh; how much do potatoes cost and why did this atrocity occur? This one simple, cheap ingredient destroyed an otherwise respectable brunch dish.   Leaving chunks of cardboard on the plate, I started on the mammoth of a pancake I ordered - I told you, I was starving. Don't judge me. Plus, no toast. Less carbs, something something. The hot cake, dusted with powdered sugar, tasted like it was made from scratch, not too fluffy but just right.  Diner Deluxe seems to have gained some notoriety in the Calgary dining scene seeing as how their horde of positive online reviews outweigh the negatives, but I'm not buying it. How many non-Yelpers have received those gross stale potatoes in the past and realized there are far better choices in this town? A patron's first impression is literally everything. And get that chick to be more personable or leave the service industry, stat! Three stars for ambiance, décor, and a well-executed half of a dish. I feel like that's even a tad generous..."}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated (very modern), with very friendly staff and great food. The girl that was my waitress I probably could have for a friend she was so friendly. Me and my friend had eggs benny and I would say that it was some of the best eggs benny that I've ever had. I would go back here in a heart beat. I would love to check it out during the summer because they look like they have a great patio as well!"}
{"text":"Slowly, but surely, Diner Deluxe has wormed its way from one of the spots I love to frequent for breaky or a late lunch to the only spot I'll actually go and wait in line for on a Sunday morning. Is it the food? Is it the service? Is it the fact that its also got things going on outside of breakfast and doesn't close at 3pm every weekday?   It is, in fact, all of these... and so much more. The menu is host to many of my favourite foods that I didn't even know could be my favourite foods because nobody else has them (or at least nobody else does them like DD) - like potato pancakes, breakfast poutine, big fluffy pancakes and good morning sliders. And have you looked at the long list of local suppliers on the website?  The coffee is free while you wait in line. And though the Urban Baker seems to have gone through its nine lives, (sniff, meow), it's at the very least a space gone to good use. Now, in the middle of winter, you don't wait in a long lineup outside. Nono, you cozy up inside on the non-existent bakery side. To make matters better (not worse, better!), it's no shitty diner coffee either. It seems Phil and Seb's is taking over the world... or at least Calgary. I'm seeing it served in a host of my favourite places. DD is no exception.  And the staff? Also exceptional. Last month, I was in and our server, Jennea kept us well looked after AND told us about a local market she was featuring some of her jewelry in. Last weekend, I was down at the East Village Christmas market and who should I find? But the very same Jennea. She remembered me before I did her. And she's not the only friendly sort with a good memory that you'll find at DD.  While Diner Deluxe does have its drawbacks (I'm really not digging whatever material the new menu is printed on... the actual menu items, right on. But that plastic stuff that's hard to keep open? What's that about? Also, it can be a tight fit between tables. If you've got a hand talker with you, make sure they're sitting on the bench seats against the wall, otherwise, calamity and spilled things may ensue. And, the breakfast sandwich... tasty, but too messy! You'll have sauce dripping down your fingers in about 3 seconds. Don't order if it's your first \"morning after\" breakfast together *wink wink*), I'm finding myself here more and more often.  Kudos on the consistent delivery, Diner Deluxe. You're the first place I bring any new visitor to Calgary and a spot I have no troubles starting... or ending... my day with."}
{"text":"My first experience here was terrible; the food wasn't good and our server was so rude that my Dad, who never complains about anything, even commented on how such a miserable person got a job dealing with people. My Dad was back in town this week and we figured that it had been a few years so we'd give it a shot again... bad mistake! We ordered the hash brown poutine with double smoked bacon and what arrived was super soggy, over cooked potatoes with what I think was supposed to be bacon but it looked and tasted like undercooked ham with massive pieces of raw fat attached.  We ended up picking all the bacon out since it was so undercooked and pretty much just hunks of fat and the waitress didn't even comment when we told her it was inedible. My Dad ended up having an omelette and it was so over cooked that the whole thing inside and out was dark brown.  I'm celiac and was ecstatic that they offered eggs benedict with a gluten-free biscuit and was completely floored that what I got was a dried out, gluten-free hamburger bun.  I told the waitress they must have made a mistake and she said \"oh, we just call it a biscuit.\"  Huh??? I can't stand gluten-free buns as it is so I put them to side but when I cut into the eggs, which I ordered medium, they were so under cooked that the whites were still runny on the inside.... nothing better than snotty eggs on a dried out hamburger bun to wet the appetite.   I guess we should have learned our lesson the first time and just headed straight to Blue Star or OEB.... sorry Dad!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner last night (Thursday August 25th) before hitting up the GlobalFest fireworks. I have been to Diner Deluxe before for breakfast, but it was a while ago and I forgot just how good the food is.   Our party was four people, and we each basically had the same thing: my wife had the Pulled Pork Sandwich; I had the Alberta Bison Burger. The people we were with also had each of those.   My wife and I split ours in half and shared (such a good thing to do when you're wanting to try out any menu) and wow, both were equally good in their own regard.  My burger was obviously handmade and loaded with spices whose names I couldn't begin to guess. What I know for sure is there was an Indian spice in there, maybe Tumric, that made all the difference in the world. It was also laden with buttery fried onion, fresh butter lettuce and buttery cherry tomatoes.   This burger literally melted in your mouth. Delish. My only complaint about the meal was the amount of home cut french fries served with it. I could count on one and a half hands how many there were. A little weak if you ask me.   The Pulled Pork was just as good. Obviously completely different. This was served with a mixture of carrot shavings on a massive ciabatta bun of some kind, but again with the same paltry amount of chips.   Prices are decent. Looking at about $12-13 for a sandwich. $14 for a main dish. Beers and wine are also decently priced. Mill Street was $6.50. 1/2 carafe of house is $31.  Service was great. Each staff member was super cool and completely attentive. Buss boy straight out of Happy Days.  Location is great. And if you can get there early on a summer eventing like we did, the patio right off of Edmonton Trail offers a gentle blend of warm evening sun and the sweet scents of traffic fumes. But seriously, when we only get 4 months of summer, it's worth it."}
{"text":"All day breakfast?!?!? Need I say more? ;)  Casual place that brings me back to my childhood - not that i was born in the 50's but I actually saw someone drinking out of a 50's coffee glass that my grandparents used back in the day - irradescent cream color with brown flowers around the rim !! hahah but I digress.  We shared 2 dishes: yukon gold potato pancake, and the maple fried oatmeal. Both were good.  The potato pancake had green onions and white onions in it and also came with your choice of double smoked pork chop or chicken, chorizo or pork sausage - Yes... It did say pork chop! lol. Potato pancake was very tasty, we opted for the chorizo which was ok - I've never had a whole chorizo before, usually it's diced up in a scramble or something and seems really greasy, but this one was dense & not greasy and it also wasn't the same red/orange color like the chorizo i eat in LA.  The Fried oatmeal was good. The lemon and cream was a nice combo. It's a meal in itself and very filling so I kinda wish they would make smaller versions (like 1/4 of the size) so that if you ordered another breakfast, you could get it on the side. =)   I would come back here to try other dishes.  I would imagine that it's super packed on the weekends so if you happen to have a day off during the week, take advantage of it.  Dress in weekend clothes cuz when you leave, you smell like the hoodfan in a kitchen!"}
{"text":"Well I decided to give it another try, after not liking it about a year ago we tried again. It all came back to me why I don't come here and go to OEB!!  The coffee was bitter, second cup a little better. Bacon tasted off and was very greasy. My son said his hash brown potatoes were hard, but I tried my hubby's they were okay in flavour. My coffee refill took a long time, I had to ask, but she was a very nice and accommodating server! The pancake with blueberries and bananas was better than the other place I tried but nothing spectacular it was moist so pretty much only thing I liked!  I won't be back, but It is packed so I imagine ppl like something here! OEB is closed for renos so if you are in the area look elsewhere! Just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Okay so Diner Deluxe is located on Edmonton Trail NE on the corner of the street.  Parking can be found on the streets, around the neighborhood and if you have to park a few blocks away and walk - don't worry...it's worth the walk.  So I actually wanted to take Alex to OEB , like really bad but it was an hour before they closed and we were hungry.  We even drove by and there were still people waiting so we decided to walk down the street to Diner Deluxe as they were opened for a bit longer.  They've got a patio but it was closed because it was a little chilly out.  You pass by a beautiful display of gelato before entering Diner Deluxe.  Friday around 2:15pm wasn't so busy so we got seated right away.  \"What a cute retro-fitted joint\" I thought to myself.  It's super cute and has a homey vibe.  We were greeted by a nonchalant waiter who cracked a few jokes and took our drink order.  \"HOME OF THE BREAKFAST POUTINE\" is what I recall seeing when I entered the diner so I had my mind set on having their famous poutine but I continued to browse the menu.  Sandwiches, Benedicts, Hashes, Pancakes, Classics OH MY.  We had our waiter suggest the bests and he mentioned the hashes and potato pancake were among the most popular - not so much the poutine.  Alex was feelin' grilled cheese but I was still struggling to make a decision, so I went on my handy dandy Yelp app and took a peek at some photos that yelpers posted.  Alex grabbed my phone and swiped through photos, \"Mmm that BBQ Pulled Pork Hash looks good - DONE! I'm getting that\".  I continue to browse and the potato pancake just. looked .so . damn. good but I'm a girl and super indecisive  -_-  because in the back of my mind, I still wanted a taste of the poutine.  Thankfully our waiter came by and said I can get a STUFFED potato pancake with bacon and cheese inside - \"Ummmmm DONE!, obvi I'll get that!\"  It normally comes with hollandaise but I was really feelin' sour cream so I got a dollop on top of my pancake - it also comes with choice of maple chicken or chorizo pork sausage.   With great company, it doesn't seem like our meals took that long to come - I snapped a few photos before we dug in.  The potato pancake was just so...perfect, I didn't want to cut into it but my stomach was telling me the opposite.  When I cut into it, there was a string of the Quebec cheese curds with a piece of double smoked bacon -the perfect bite. OMG, it was SO heavenly...the potato pancake is perfectly crisp, the cheese and bacon add texture - an orgasm in your mouth.  The cilantro sour cream on top was amazing, nice and cool and mixed well with the pancake.  The chorizo sausage was big, a hint of spice but juicy all in one bite.  Alex's hash came with some toast and it was a generous portion in a skillet.  Mixture of tasty pulled pork, caramelized onions, apple relish topped with a cooked to order egg and a dollop of mustard.  He seemed to enjoy it as it quickly disappeared.  Meanwhile, I tried eat my whole pancake but the leftovers made for a perfect evening snack.  Overall, the meals were amazing and the service was great.  We left completely satisfied!  Diner Deluxe is an awesome joint to hit up and catch up with your friends or bring your visiting guests to....I think the stuffed potato pancake is now one of my favorite brunch items - of all time!  Next time I will try it with hollandaise sauce instead and attempt to save room for some gelato next door!! :)"}
{"text":"Classic dinner experience. Kitsch setting, gets crowded, but a great menu and very friendly service."}
{"text":"YUM!  This place has an incredible Banana's Foster French Toast. I cannot get enough of them. I have been there twice now after having that the first time a few months back.   The place is quite crowded, but somehow  you still feel like you have enough space.   The server's are fantastic!   The line can be pretty long at times, but they do turn tables over quickly. There is lots of waiting room inside and outside.   I would highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars because my meals here have been good but not excellent. The atmosphere is great, relaxed and family friendly. Another good neighbourhood option and they are consistent."}
{"text":"Love the new space for the Deluxe's second location! The food was so fresh and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed the wild mushroom ( actually different varietals of wild mushrooms in there not like other spots who claim \" wild mushrooms\" and they're white or crimini..) eggs Benny with basil infused hollandaise sauce. Wow! Comes with rosemary roasted potatoes and I highly recommend making it \"poutine\" for and extra 3 bucks. Other people at the table tried egg white frittata and the vegan scramble. Both got rave reviews."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. The two friends I ate there with had hot & delicious meals but...  My $16 sausage & tomato eggs benny was luke warm at best and therefore kinda gross. My hash browns were so cold it was like they were in the fridge or something. Weird right? I asked for new ones and they came hot but half of them were uncooked. Still hard/ raw in the middle. I ordered an extra side of hollandaise sauce and it was served cold. When I asked about it the waitress said that's how they serve it. It didn't taste very good to begin with, but even worse because it was cold (like fresh out of the refrigerator cold).   Unfortunately, I can't recommend eating here. It's pricey for brunch and the food just wasn't worth it. Won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"Review: poutine features.  This week was Poutine With Purpose which restaurants all over the city create their own version of Poutine to help raise meals for the less fortunate youth through mealshare. Diner Deluxe had a pretty interesting Poutine so we decided to check it out.  Bottomline: fantastic poutine and wonderful family friendly atmosphere.   Atmosphere: from the name, I was expecting a restaurant with vintage furniture and diner booths. I was surprised to see how modern and bright the place was when I stepped in. There were 2 floors and it seemed their main sitting area was downstairs. Patio was also below, which was facing a nice scenery of a man made lake. Another surprise was the kiddie corner for kids to play in, which I thought was two thumbs way up to make this restaurant family friendly.  Food: we came here for the Poutine, and wow did they deliver. Their Poutine With Purpose was called the Cassoulet Poutine and had a truckload of toppings bursting with awesome flavors. I had to fish for the fries near the end of the dish. It was truly a guilty pleasure that I wouldn't mind repeating. Their other Poutine was the butter chicken Poutine, which was also a feature but not part of the fundraiser. It too was topped with delicious ingredients. Unfortunately, because it didn't have a good variety of toppings, the dish felt fairly monotone near the end. It also came with garlic flatbread, which I was not sure how it fitted in with the rest of the dish.  Value: The Cassoulet Poutine was $19, which I would consider expensive if it wasn't for charity. But because all proceeds to go mealshare, I would say the dish has the best value of anything I've eaten thus far. The butter chicken Poutine was $18 and I thought it was more expensive than what was offered."}
{"text":"We have been to the aspen location many many times. Service is consistently good and fast. I have tried their brunch menu the most, their Mac n cheese is good. The kids play area is such a bonus. My daughter loves it there, but you have to be careful bc a few parents didn't  supervise their kids, ofcourse they are there to eat I guess so the kids experience can go downhill pretty fast. ya e had been lucky every time to get a table by the play area every time so it was super easy to keep an eye on our kids during meal time. Overall, great experience. This place is good for family, friends, kids, large groups. And stroller and wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"Great veal meatloaf, nice retro tables and chairs. Service was friendly, a little slow but relaxed."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service sucked. The restaurant was slammed so it was a 20 minute wait which is totally understandable. My meal arrived and it took another 15 minutes before my friend's meal arrived after bringing out someone else's meal. The waitress hardly came around at all. They need some training."}
{"text":"What a nice hidden spot in west Calgary.  Situated in a shopping complex, this restaurant has a beautiful patio by the water and a great menu for brunch items.  We had pancakes with a side of bacon, community salad and the grilled chicken Apple sandwich.  Washed it all down with a sparkling lemonade and some blackcurrant spritzer.  The portions were huge and the quality was excellent.  Highly recommended for a quiet brunch and just to enjoy the weather while it's still sunny and warm."}
{"text":"Calgary's breakfast diner market is very competitive. We have enjoyed Diner Deluxe over the years. The food and portion size are typically very good. They seem to be moving towards a more traditional hash brown and eggs menu. However, the pricing is higher than most traditional diners.  The bright, higher energy atmosphere can be fun. If you are looking for a retro diner experience with good coffee and good food this is the place. Expect a little longer wait for seating and food service. Wait staff have all been great and as attentive as possible in a busy environment."}
{"text":"Just got off my flight from Montreal and got introduced to this place by my daughter and her roommate. No exaggeration the best brunch I've ever had ... and I've had a few. The pulled pork skillet (with poached eggs) was truly an experience - a great experience. Had a taste of pancake .... fluffy, filling  to die for - I can't believe I just said that I'm sounding like my daughter. Outstanding service from Ms. cedar, we talked tats, Montreal and her Calgary style \"Baygels\".   You've got to go here!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Went for the first time today and had a very good experience. The service was amazing, the food and coffee were delicious, the atmospheere was chill. I went at 1 on a Friday and had no lineup.   Would definitely recommend this spot for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Accidentally came here on my trip to Canada. I think I have to plan another trip just for this place. It really was that good"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Food is amazing  Service is pretty good (a little slow when busy)  Play area for children is genius  Only minor complaint is the system they use for seating. I stood beside me open table for 25 mins waiting to be seated. I even asked the host if we could be seated as there were numerous other open tables but she would not accommodate and used their \"system\" as her reason."}
{"text":"I am traumatized.  I will admit that I hadn't eaten here in awhile but I returned today for lunch.  The atmosphere has completely changed and it is not the cool retro diner it once was.  Most of the awesome furniture has been removed and replaced in order cram more customers in the door for business, I'm sure of it.  The decor has completely changed as well and it no longer feels authentic, with the exception of the restroom.  Sorry, but I won't be hanging out in there for very long.  I don't like that they blocked the front door either and made me walk through their neighboring business, which is now a display of gelato instead of fresh baking.  What is going on here?    The service was slow and the staff seemed low energy.  I ordered the fresh greens salad with salmon.  They ruined the salmon.  It was totally overdone and the edges were like a hard crust.    Sigh.  My love for Diner Deluxe has died.  It no longer stands out as something special."}
{"text":"My daughters took me to Diner Deluxe for my birthday and I was very excited. I've been here before and one thing Diner Deluxe does well with is comfort food in a relaxed retro diner setting.   I had the Rocky Mountain Omelette loaded with bacon and cheese. They must have used at least 4 eggs, it was huge. Accompanied by Rosemary hash browns which were delish. Instead of toast they gave me fresh tomato's at no extra charge. Overall the meal was very good. I can't say excellent because the omelette was overdone and a little dry.   The place has a very cool relaxed vibe and the service is friendly. Be prepared to wait a bit, this place is one popular breakfast joint. It is expensive too but with it."}
{"text":"Went here in a desperate attempt to find a new breakfast spot that doesn't disappoint (SW downtown is nearly all gruel) and saw this place online.   Great spot, easy enough location, wonderful decor.   MASSIVE LINE UPS. Incomprehensible for a snowy-ass day. Overall, most restaurants in this city seem to have line ups at breakfast, so it wasn't a huge surprise, but in a city with limited access to good breaky places, I think that it is the responsibility of the ownership/staff to move people along on a day where it's dumping snow and 40 + ppl are waiting.   Good vegan options. Good french toast. Coffee refills were fast. Wish it was closer to the SW of DT."}
{"text":"We were there at 8:30am and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for two and now that we've eaten there we don't understand what all the hype is about.  Had the Canadian Bacon Omlette with \"Poutine Hashbrowns\".  It was two eggs served on top of ham slices with holandaise sauce served on top of two biscuits.  The Poutine Hashbrowns consisted of potatoes with white cheese curds melted on top with a little bit of peppers and onions.  The two things I noticed first was that the biscuits were cold and spongy and the eggs were fabulous.  I don't know where they found the eggs but the yolks were so deep they were almost red.  Amazing eggs but they were unable to make up for the rest of the lousy dish.  The dish was difficult to eat because they placed these oversized slices of ham between the eggs and the biscuits.  It wasn't even good ham, either.  It was too salty and was tough.  There wasn't enough holondaise sauce, either and the sauce wasn't anything to write home about.  The poutine hashbrowns were overcooked to the point where the potatoes were burnt. The dish came to a whopping $18.  I got a little sick after eating this meal so I had a look at the health inspection reports on the city of calgary website.  These guys get in trouble for leaving food at room temperature overnight on a regular basis.  Won't be eating there again.  There are better places that serve better food for the same price.  This place is all hype and they take advantage of that with poor kitchen practices and mediocre food."}
{"text":"This one of the two popular breakfast joints in the nearby vicinity. It's good.   What else can I say? Local drinks are cool to try. Retro feel throughout.   I've come to accept that having OEB nearby is a blessing. If either one is full, go to the other."}
{"text":"Had lunch there a few weeks ago; place is nice, good ambience. Server was nice but he couldn't recommend some of the dishes because he hasn't tried them. I had the strangest, weirdest dish I've ever had and not in a good way. The \"Huevos Rancheros\" should not be called that, this name is deceiving and totally inaccurate.  These are two eggs on a bed of potatoes, on top of the potatoes you have chunks of minced chicken, a bit of salsa on the side and greasy tostitos on the other side. It was really bad. Huevos rancheros are a couple of fried eggs over corn tortillas covered in salsa. Where did they get the idea of the minced chicken and the potatoes? I was expecting more. May give them a second chance eventually."}
{"text":"A great breakfast joint!    I was actually looking forward to having a cheeseburger at 830AM (as per a recommendation from a fellow Yelper) but sadly they don't serve their other menu until 11AM *sad face*  So we settled with breakfast.  We ordered the pulled pork hash and the crispy potato pancake with sausage.  Both items were very hearty - a great size portion.  Food is flavourful and tasty.  I was a bit disappointed as we were stuck sitting at the table closest to the door which had a very breezy draft every time someone walked in.  I'd return for a true diner experience."}

Now with two locations, the rumor of hour-long waits on weekends mitigated by an early Monday meal, entry to Diner Deluxe finds patrons in a Soda Fountain styled area featuring Gelato, Pac-Man, the brightly lit room beyond full of old-school signage and smiling servers plus two men working the oven and griddles.  Proudly promoting local purveyors and farms, prices slightly higher than the typical diner as a result, long perusal finds the menu filled with options for diners of all-styles, the challenge of accommodating allergies and limitations taken quite seriously as the young woman acting as waitress went out of her way to inquire at the time of order, something far more typical of fine-dining environs.  Seated at a cozy two-top next to an elderly widower in the mood for conversation, clearly a regular judged by his interaction with staff, Breakfast began with an elegantly presented square of pan-seared Oats thoroughly soaked in Custard and Maple Syrup, the pool of Crème Anglaise in which it rested acting to further soften the wedge beneath a scoop of zesty Lemon Curd.  Offering bottomless Coffee from Phil & Sebastian, a local producer featuring great light roasts at many restaurants visited during the days in Alberta, course two featured egg-dredged Sourdough wrapped around melted Brie, Canadian Bacon and Apple Relish, the sidecar of Rosemary Syrup proving downright inspired as an addition to the sandwich, while also proving complimentary to the $3CAD upgraded side of well-seasoned Hash Browns that remained crispy even with the addition of housemade Hollandaise and stretchy Cheese Curds.  Half-joking when inquiring about dessert, but more than happy to indulge when the kitchen said they would be willing to oblige, it was after a quick warming on the grill that an \"Apple Pie Wedge\" arrived bathed in hot Caramel Sauce, the light hints of booze mingling with Cinnamon and Fruit topped in buttery Streusel."}
{"text":"My husband and I are recent transplants to Calgary, so we are still exploring the Calgary-breakfast scene; regardless, this was definitely a great place to start. For a Saturday morning, the place was busy bbut not too much so (I ordered a latte and my husband got some gelato while we waited, so pretty awesome). The service was a little slow, but the place was packed, so it didn't really bother us that the waitress only come around once with coffee/water refills.   The amtosphere was that of a trendy diner and there was a good amount of space for small or large parties.   Anyway, the thing you probably most was to know about is the food. The menu was your standard brunch menu with a twist - there were potato pancakes, a variety of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, etc. We both got the potato pancake (which is huge.) My husband got the maple chicken sausage and added cheese curds and bacon to his. I got a fried egg on top wtih fried tomatoes as a side. It was delciious. I definitely think the egg added to mine and my husband said the same for the bacon. I think they would be good without it but why not make them even better?  We are still unsure of where are living in the city, but regardless, I am sure we will be back to diner deluxe."}
{"text":"I have been here twice (for brunch) since I moved to Calgary a few weeks ago. This place doesn't disappoint. The place is ecclectic and the food even more so. The first time I went I had the grilled cheese and southwest soup- that was fantastic! Second time I got the breakfast poutine skillet- it was delicious but too much for me to finish- it is very rich but worth it.   I haven't been for lunch or dinner, but highly recommend breakfast/brunch. And it doesn't hurt that this place was also featured on YGEH."}
{"text":"The waitress was great but my veggie burger was too soggy.  I've been there before and the food was better."}
{"text":"Very good place for brunch!! I really enjoyed the food here!! I have been there twice and both times brunch was great! My only recommendation is to make reservations as it gets very busy!! But the service is really good and they also have a kids area ... which is very helpful for families!! If you don't like to be around kids you can be in the upper area of the restaurant! Definitely a very nice place I recommend for brunch in the area!"}
{"text":"--- Food --- My partner & I was deciding on going to OEB but it's closed for renovations. So we decided to try Diner Deluxe, he heard good things here! Both our first time here.   Salmon Egg Benny - we both ordered our usual favs. I wouldn't order this again because the salmon was way too salty. The roasted potatoes weren't as good as other places we've tried. Overall, it was just okay... We definitely liked the ones from Dairy Lane better. $15  Coffee - Phil & Sebastian, $3, tastes good!   --- Atmosphere --- The diner is pretty big, lots of tables inside, it was pretty much all packed for brunch! But the wait wasn't long.  Even though there was a line up, the waitress was great in not rushing us even though we finished eating!  Service was pleasant.   --- Summary --- We would consider coming back again and try something else. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast spots in Calgary.  For my money I will take there pancakes with blueberry compote any day of the week.  Also, the fact that they serve breakfast all day is a major plus!  The retro decor makes this a fun place to visit.  I took a recent out of town guest and they loved it.  Definitely one to recommend to all your friends."}
{"text":"As a born-and-raised Calgarian, now living in Toronto, I am ashamed that a Torontonian had to tell me how great this place was. Its easy enough to drive by, as I had hundreds of times before on my way home from work.   I had the eggs benny with Canadian bacon. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the minced basil in the holandaise sauce was a great addition. The side of potatoes were tasty.   My friend had the oatmeal which I sampled and I can agree with Kat F. that it is amazing. You almost just want to eat the lemon curd and not the oatmeal."}
{"text":"I'd been to Diner Deluxe before and had a lack lustre experience so I thought I'd give it another shot for a late brunch today. My boyfriend ordered the Rocky Mountain omelette which he loved and I ordered the Veggie Burrito and made it vegan with tofu, and no cheese/sour cream. It was really tasty and the hash browns were the best part of the meal. My only complaint was that the burrito was really really soggy. Our waitress told me it was because of the tofu, this is because they used soft tofu and didnt cook it before hand. I'd really recommend they go for firm tofu and fry it before assembling, just like they would for the eggs that typically come with it. Overall the food was pretty good! And the service was pretty speedy and friendly (maybe a little too friendly with all those shoulder grabs)"}
{"text":"After reading reviews from some of my favourite Yelpers, I had to try this place.  It wasn't too busy when we got there, so service was quick.  The Phil & Sebastian's coffee they were promoting was pretty terrible.  The food, on the other hand, was great!  The atmosphere was eclectic, although I suppose you could say they've created a theme (plates)."}
{"text":"I like the vibe! I had the opportunity to eat here for breakfast. I had to wait 25 minutes and wish that they served coffee to waiting guests. I loved the variety of options on the menu but felt they were a limited for people who don't like red meat or pork. I enjoyed my eggs and toast but was disappointed about the chicken sausage. We have Adelle's chicken apple sausage in the states and their sausage is no where in comparison. Do not order the sausage. The waitress and staff are very friendly! I would love to check out this place again."}
{"text":"Brunch is good here, lots of yummy and creative options. It is pretty busy so it's good that you can reserve at the Aspen location."}
{"text":"Loved the food, ambiance, and friendly staff. Was surprised that there was hardly any wait on a Saturday morning. I had the classic breakfast at about 9am and it kept me full for lunch too."}
{"text":"This was a super cool place- I'd highly recommend for brunch! Very original dishes, generous portion sizes. Our server was personable, friendly, and patient as we tried to decide what we wanted. Coffee was flowing. Decorated like an old school diner. We loved it for our first meal in Calgary!"}
{"text":"A visit to another \"You Gotta Eat Here\" restaurant in Calgary.  Due to my finicky stomach, I have to be selective in what I eat. The smell of the stuff with dairy here made my mouth water.   I stole a bite of some \"nasty\" dairy food. (Ok, I still miss it, but I have to call it that so I don't die eating it.)  It was pretty yummy.  I had the gluten free bun with my burger, the burger was tasty, the fries were as good as anywhere else.  Side-note: I'm not intolerant of gluten but I'm curious to see what it's like when I see it on a menu to see if anyone's improved on a gluten free bun. From what I saw, Nope. It had the consistency of crumbly cornbread. It pretty much disintegrated while I was eating the burger. I feel like an idiot asking for burgers wrapped in iceberg lettuce but I may have to go back to that as gluten and wheat are on the radar for elimination.  Breakfasts all looked amazing, and from what I had tasted pretty good too.  I'll next frequent this place maybe around Stampede..."}
{"text":"This place was better than my family and I were expecting it to be. We wanted to go to OEB next door, but were too hungry to wait in line. The 4 stars convinced us to go in despite the unimaginative menu. The food and service were decent, nothing special. My 10 year old nephew likes the old school pac-man arcade game in the front."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe? More like Diner De-Flux.  I've never felt so ignored by restaurant staff then I did when I walked into Diner Deluxe that day.  Firstly, when you go into a restaurant there is usually someone waiting to greet you and seat you, or tell you how long of a wait it's going to be.  I experienced neither.  Instead, I had to stand around at the door looking at all the employees walk by me.  I saw three of them make eye contact with me and not even make a motion of acknowledgment.  We stood at the door for almost 20 minutes before we were finally seated.  Luckily, they have plenty of things to read while you wait.  They have half a dozen lists of rules and regulations sprinkled around their doorway.  Never before had I seen a restaurant telling their customers so many things about what they should and should not do.  Most of it seemed a little ridiculous too.  \"Once we bring you the bill, please leave.\"  Whatever happened to, \"Here's your bill, but no hurry.  If I can get you anything else, please let me know\"?  Honestly.  Talk about feeling rushed after a meal.  Having felt completely ignored at the beginning of the experience, I slowly started to feel smothered by the waitresses once we were seated.  I realize they are just doing their job and being polite, but I could barely get three words of a conversation out.  Every two minutes a different lady would come around asking if we were okay or needed anything. They probably had 10 waitresses working that afternoon, and the place wasn't even busy.  Apparently they require a lot of people to ignore you before you're seated, and then harass you during your meal.  To be fair, the food there was delicious!!!  It's the one and only reason I would go back again... and probably again.  They have an inventive take on breakfast and lunch, with so many different and out-of-the-ordinary ingredients.  Very cool for people who like to stray from the usual.  I enjoyed a delightful strawberry brewed iced tea (granted I asked for unsweetened, but received it with plenty of sugar) with my meal, which was quite refreshing on a warm summer day.  Sadly I slurped it down too fast and there was no free refill.  :(  It's a good thing the food was so tasty or I wouldn't have any reason to go back.  For the most part, the place was a mood kill when you're looking to have a cozy Sunday brunch... or any other day of the week.  Good thing for good food!"}
{"text":"Great food with a good variety of food. This a great location for families due to space and tables large enough to accommodate. You have to be careful with them trying to upsell. For example, my order gave the option for chicken, beef or pork sausage and when asked what kind of meat I wanted  I said chicken and they brought chicken breast and tried to charge me much more for something that was not an option. Other than that the food and coffee is great."}
{"text":"super hip, super friendly, super deluxe deelish grub.  came in one early sat morning after shooting the sunrise, feeling famished.  my friend and i both opted for the pulled pork hash with caramelized apple and dijon with poached eggs.  omg, this dish was amazing.  i would've gave a 5 star rating, but the poached egg yolk came a little overdone (i like mine runny yo).  our server was always attentive and ready with top up for our coffees, which was a great brew.  definitely a fan and am looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for business last year and Diner Deluxe came highly recommended to me by everyone that had ever been to the city. It was so amazingly tasty that I went back TWICE in a three day visit!  The baked oatmeal with lemon curd will render you speechless. Six months later I'm still dreaming about (and drooling over) it. It's incredibly rich and unforgettable. I MUST find a way to duplicate it, or get back to Calgary ASAP to have it again!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for about 1/2 hour before we could get our table for 4.  While waiting, there was complimentary coffee with stevia or sugar and cream.  Only thing missing were spoons or stir sticks.    Loved the 50's theme of the restaurant.  It had a certain quirkiness yet it works for the restaurant.  Very busy and bustling environment.  If you don't like noisy places, this is not for you!    The food was great!  We ordered the Eggs Benedict with Grilled Chorizo and Spinach, the 2 eggs with pork sausage and the Canada Day Special - omelette with Canadian bacon, sundried tomato, mushrooms and cheese.  All served with multigrain toast - that is a big plus for us!  They even have peanut butter!  Loved the cute bottle of ketchup!  The meals all came with hash browns - more oven roasted with little chunks of sweet potato and green onion.  I wish I could have free substitution for the hash brown for either tomatoes or fruit.  If I make a substitution, there was a charge of at least $1.50 to switch from potatoes to something that was carb-free.      Service was good and quick.  Lots of wait staff around and coffee was refilled 3 or more times.   Parking could be a problem as there really isn't any place to park - just street parking, at the back of the restaurant, if you're lucky and a small parking lot on the north side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's average! It's a cute place but it' so unbelievably noisy on the weekends and it's definitely a family oriented place so...if you don't want babies screaming in your ear then it's probably not the place for you. Service is average- can't say I was particularly impressed. I didn't even know who our server was until the very end when we were paying.   I definitely enjoyed the food though. It wasn't anything that blew me away but I enjoyed my meal and the portion size is good.   We'll probably return when it's a little warmer to check out the patio and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Diner Deluxe is one of those places that I enjoy every time I go, and then realize I don't go often enough. Tonight was one of those nights...While driving around Bridgeland trying to find a place to settle in while it was cold and snowy outside, we discovered Monday nights is a bad night for food in Bridgeland - everything was closed. Weird. So we ventured \"up the hill\" to visit DD as we haven't been in a number of months.  I am extremely glad we did - cause it was awesome! It was pretty quiet, but about 10 tables busy. We got seated right away by the cutest waitress in history (I'll come back to her), and quickly had our drink orders taken. I ordered a Grandville Island Beer monthly choice (which to my surprise was the Hefeweizen - my favorite), and my fellow diner had a raspberry milkshake, made from real ice cream that was so amazing my legs started to shake. Ok seriously, it was pretty amazing. I had the Buffalo burger with broccoli/potato soup which was really good. The burger had an amazing \"relish\" with outstanding caramelized onions and gooey cheese. The soup was homemade and fresh/tasty without being ridiculously thick and over creamy. Across the table was a Gouda French toast stuffed with ham (the bread was fluffy, the cheese gooey and the ham salty - perfect combo). So supper was clearly a delicious success.  Back to our waitress friend Chelsea B who made the night. Chelsea was likely the cutest person I have ever met. We thought she was similar to Barbie (the Mattel Barbie, in an adorable way). Orders were taken fast, drinks refilled, checkups done and every time she was adorably smiling, super attentive and looked like she loved serving people - a rarity sometimes when going out to eat. I have given the overall experience 4 stars, but I give Chelsea 6 stars. As some take home notes: Their weekly specials (Mondays is pasta) looked intriguing. They have a taco night, a beer and burger night and a roast night. They also have a southern cooking night which I want to come back for. I didn't have it tonight (because I get it every time), but their Mac and Cheese is the best thing on the go. I've had it 20 times at least and every time I saw it getting served tonight, I wanted to stand up and grab it away to devour it myself. Highly recommended.   Diner Deluxe is a bit retro meets a bit hipster, but the food is great, atmosphere is relaxed and casual and the prices are pretty cheap for what you get. Get the Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Sad, I have been here so many times, and this is my first review.  This is an institution. They have an amazing retro diner vibe with super friendly staff.  The service is usually very quick and the food is always on point. From items like chocolate sourdough French toast to their breakfast burgers thus place is absolutely on point.   Not to be missed is the fact that they serve Phil and Sabastion coffee.   My omelets today was cooked perfectly, absolutely the right portion size with the side of fruit.  After many visits .....I am happy to report that they continue to set the bar high."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't left a nice review for Diner Deluxe yet!  Location, design and atmosphere are not for everyone taste, but food is capable of satisfying a way wider audience.  When I've asked my Italian friend living in the area, what would he recommend from their menu, he answered without hesitation: \"Everything!\"  And that was correct. I tried various things, all good. Excellent choice for lunch or brunch, good to go with kids, too.  Service was a bit uneven, but not really bad. If anything, though, that'd be another reason for \"not quite five stars\" rating besides the way this place looks.  But in any case, quite recommended to check out - and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not as busy as the Diner Deluxe on Edmonton Trail, but a smaller size (from my quick glance).  I went in on a weekday morning so there was only one other person there.   I ordered the French Toast.  It was on flax bread and came with mascarpone and mixed berries.   It was a large portion and was tasty.    Service was generally good, but with no one there that is to be expected."}
{"text":"We had planned to go to OEB this weekend, but AFTER paying for parking found out that they were not open - seriously, on a Sunday!?     So we walked down the block and stumbled upon Diner Deluxe.  It didn't look too busy because we walked right into the doorway and it only looked like a few parties.  We didn't realize that people waiting were ALSO in the adjacent fiasco gelato place having coffee while they waited.    Our wait was approximately half an hour, and it got way busier after we signed our name.  There's a cute couch, and complimentary coffee while you wait, which was a cute touch.  Upon being called (hallelujah) we were placed at a large table in between two other couples, the space wasn't too bad, but you get the joy of overhearing everyone's conversations and scope out what they're having as well.  I ordered the Canadian bacon eggs benedict and an unsweetened strawberry iced tea.   The food came out at diner speed, which was impressive.   The eggs were delicious, and the hashbrowns weren't bad - they were kind of inconsistently cooked but still had some nice flavour with the green onions.  Without the wait this place would be much higher rated, but the food was fairly good and I really liked the homestyle decor."}
{"text":"Used to be a funky breakfast place...tried it for dinner once and was very disappointed...slow service and half of what we ordered was altered from what it should have been. Now it's new owners....and have not heard enough good things about it to want to return."}
