{"text":"Take a drive down Madison Avenue in Cudell, Ohio, and you eventually end up in the industrial district where you are surrounded mostly by abandoned buildings and rough roads and empty lots. Lost in all of this, in a small building that looks equally rough, is a small diner called A Tasty Affair. Though the owners need to invest in some signage out front to make locating the diner easier for potential drive-by customers, our GPS unit found it without issue.  The interior is a stark contrast to the exterior. Impeccably clean, bright, and simply but tastefully appointed, it is a homey and comfortable place to have a quick bite. My best friend had eggs with home fries and a sausage patty. The sausage patty was hand formed and as big a burger! The eggs were perfectly cooked, the home fries were crispy and seasoned well . My country boy skillet, with layers of scrambled egg, home fries, bacon, cheese, and sausage gravy was delicious and filling. The coffee is Red Cedar brand coffee, local brand from Berea, and was a perfect compliment to the savory notes of our breakfast. As a bonus, we also bought some homemade cranberry granola and some French waffles to take with us!   Down the street and around the corner by just a half mile, you can drive right into Lakewood, Ohio. My point is that this little place is not out in some inaccessible spot. Take the time to find it, go eat, support this young couple in their attempt to bring tasty, quality home cooking to an area that seems to desperately need it."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever!!!!  I have dined here many times and the quality of the food cannot be beat.  The food is always freshly prepared with the highest quality ingredients.  The service is excellent as well.  Seriously, give it a try.  For breakfast I would recommend the skillet breakfast or the French Toast with strawberry sauce.  And this is not just any strawberry sauce.  This is freshly prepared with all natural ingredients!  For lunch, I highly recommend the quesadillas.  Especially with a side of the black bean and corn rice.  It is delicious.  On your way out, DO NOT forget to take some muffins to go.  They are baked fresh every day, once again with all natural ingredients. (All natural ingredients are a theme here)  Please next time you are out and about try this place.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Previous reviews were right on the money: this was a great lil' diner experience. I had the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, and the Greek style ranch was delicious! Clean and welcome atmosphere. Friendly owner who's dedicated to providing healthier options - with tasty results."}
{"text":"I never write yelp reviews but the experience and food I had at A Tasty Affair was incredible when I first tried it a few months ago. Went there a few times between then and now and just attempted to go this morning and they seem to be closed. This is disappointing because not only was the food great but the couple who own it were very nice and welcoming. If they are closed hopefully they open another restaurant somewhere soon, maybe in a location that will get more people to go to."}
