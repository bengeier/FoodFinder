{"text":"This is Airdrie's own Wetherspoons, located right in the town centre. This would probably be round about my last resort if I was looking for somewhere to have a drink locally. It's just the same as the Wetherspoons in every other town and city in the country - cheap booze (which is the only reason I'd ever consider going here), no music, tasteless food, overcrowded. No soul, no character, no atmosphere. And the toilets are all the way up the stairs! Still, if you choose to go here then you know what you're getting and the cheap drink and cheap food formula obviously works for them so if that's all you're looking for in a pub then go on in."}
{"text":"Probably the most popular bar in Airdrie town centre. This is a good place to catch up with friends for a few cheap pints, however it really is under resourced on both a Friday and Saturday night and can take a very long time to get served. The foreign bottle beer selection is very good with bottles of Erdinger, Leffe blonde, Tucher, Moretti and a load of others on offer for reasonable prices. Would like to see these beers on draught. They don't offer any local Scottish draught beers and stick to the same generic lagers. I think it could be doing with some new decor."}
{"text":"This is a typical Wotherspoons right in the middle of Airdrie town centre. As usual there is no music playing so it does lack a bit of atmosphere. The food isn't great either but it does come quickly so if your after a quick bite, it isn't so bad. I like the layout in this pub as it has three levels - in saying that there is only one bar on the ground floor which can be very busy at times so I suppose it can be a bit of a trek especially if you are buying a round of drinks on a tray. The toilets are also located on the top floor level which after a few drinks, some people find it difficult to negotiate the stairs - have seen a few people losing thir footing before now. An ok place if you remmber that it is a Wetherspoons and don't expect anything else."}
{"text":"Good value on beers, the food can be okay, even good at times!"}
