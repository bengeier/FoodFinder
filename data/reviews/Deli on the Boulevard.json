{"text":"My wife and 4 year old went in for breakfast today (which is served all day) and it was great. The service was excellent, the food was very tasty, the prices were good. I can't wait to come back and try a deli sandwich. The place was pretty busy and everyone eating there seemed to enjoy."}
{"text":"I have heard this many times, the owner is not friendly. Aside from that the food is fair at best. The breakfast sandwich that we got was served on a hamburger roll, especially when the question was asked, does it come on a hard roll. I have been here 3 times in trying to give this new business an opportunity to fix things. We desperately need a local place but not at the expense of bad food. Sorry folks, get your act together, stop fighting in front of customers and serve me my food on the type of bread that I asked for not what you happen to have and think that's ok."}
{"text":"I had an egg salad sandwich.  It was clearly not freshly made egg salad and just plopped in a mound on very dry sourdough bread.  It appears that by a lot of packaged food and there bread leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a great local place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I just had the yummy Florentine omelette special...  Great service too."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The service is always great and the few times I have been my food has always been great. The food is really good quality and they have a very decent selection. I would love to go back for breakfast.  I've only been for lunch and an early dinner."}
{"text":"I need this place to be good. I live out here...we need a restaurant that isn't pizza.   I wanted this to become where I stopped when I didn't feel like making dinner. Doesn't need to be fancy, just good.  The food isn't good. We got the Italian sausage and pepper sandwich, the meatloaf and matzo ball soup.  I don't know how you screw up a sausage on a bun. They left off the cheese. The sausage was so incredibly bland it was like eating rubbery grease. My husbands meatloaf reminded me of school cafeteria food. The matzo ball soup was close to Campbell's with matzo balls tossed in. I don't think they make it there, which is sad. Soup isn't hard. I make it in my kitchen when it isn't like hell outside. I am no chef and it turns out quite tasty. I have faith in you, Vistancia deli folk. Make some tasty soup. You can do it. You can't just have good cold cuts. I can go to Safeway and get good bread and cold cuts and make the same thing.  Please, little deli. Fix it. I need you to succeed. I want to go get breakfast and lunch and dinner from you. I want to give you my money. But you need to do better."}
{"text":"Place was clean & presentable, and the staff seemed to be pleasant enough.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich which came out just some plain corned beef on, what I would call super market loaf rye bread, totally dry and a pickle slice   I can't say it was bad just that it did not leave me with a memorable experience; just an ok one.   I would've surprised if this deli is still here when I return to the area when I return next year."}
{"text":"This place is very very sad.  The food and service were both poor.  I would not recommend this place to a starving homeless person.  You couldn't pay me to dine there again."}
{"text":"A great local find if you live in and around Vistancia or near Lake Pleasant Pkwy and Happy Valley Road.  My wife and I enjoyed lunch there on Sunday and was amazed at the generous portions, great flavors and fair prices. My wife enjoyed her liverwurst sandwich-flavorful and presented on freshly made rye bread.  Her side salad was good- try the homemade thousand island dressing-outstanding.  I had the Rachel sandwich on soft, fresh rye bread with generous portions of tasty pastrami. The sandwich is topped with coleslaw and that great homemade thousand island dressing. The side of potato salad was the only disappointment; it was bland, lacked salt and flavor...Fountain drinks, coffee and tea are INCLUDED in the price-making it very reasonable!  For dessert we shared a freshly made apple turnover that was served warm...delicious! We will gladly return soon!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and I ordered Ruben sandwich came with coleslaw. .super tasty delish! My husband had omlette and loved it! We love to support family business and this is family owned.  Big menu to pick from. I already want to go back and try the soup! Our waitress told us the owner makes all the soups! Awrsome. She said fries are must try and I want to try meatballs next time as well."}
{"text":"Upon walking in you aren't feeling welcome at all.  The sign says wait to be seated but you are left with by who??  Then someone asks can I help you and you tell them you would like to be seated and you play a waiting game.  The lady behind cashier/deli is beyond rude, very the vibe isn't warm.  You get seated and friendly waitress takes your order.  The cups have a slime feel to them.  Food came out on time.  Nothing fancy, just a typical cafe food.  The portion of the fries are small.  When you are finish you have to pay at the deli/front area that is congested with incoming/take outs and deli orders.  Again having to deal with a very cranky/rude women at the front.  Found out she was the owner too.  You would think she would be friendly and welcoming to make sure you come back but she wasn't.  I will never spend a dime here due to the rude vibe of the place.  Not to mention before even reaching my home I became very sick!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? One thing I can't tolerate is bad service. We went to dinner with the family and my mother-in-law. During our dinner we ordered our infant child to dinner first and asked if they could immediately bring it out. We ordered macaroni and cheese. We then proceeded to place our order and within 15 minutes our order came to the table but still no macaroni and cheese. my two-year-old daughter was not willing to wait for her macaroni and cheese especially since she saw us all with our food in front of us. We asked about the macaroni and cheese and it was evident that she had never put the order in. We fed my daughter from a little bit of everybody's plate to give her a variety. We were done with our mediocre dinner and still no macaroni and cheese. When we asked for the bill she brought the bill and the macaroni and cheese at the same time. When we went to pay we asked the manager/ owner about the macaroni and cheese and she stated that she had to charge us for the macaroni and cheese because we ordered it. She did nothing to compensate us for our time and effort, not to mention the frustration of our experience. Yes you are correct I will not be coming back. By the way from the looks of it you need all the customers you can get.  Big surprise they are out of business today!  Restaurant owners, you should really take feedback from your reviews and make The necessary changes needed to satisfy the majority of your customers."}
{"text":"I keep giving this place another chance, and the food is decent, but the smell of the backed up sewer line is just too much. Call your landlord or clean out the grease trap."}
{"text":"This is a full service deli and restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The deli sells Italian, Jewish, some kosher food, what looks like fresh made breads, baked desserts and bagels. They do take out items or you can dine in. This deli is very unusual and features Italian foods like meatballs, pastas, Italian lunch meats, the \"Vinci Family cannoli's and Jewish Style foods like  matzo ball soup, blintzes and knishes. The restaurant small cute and stylish. They also have a few tables outside.  I tried a pastrami sandwich called the Rachel that was on rye and was topped with fresh made cole slaw and Russian dressing. My sandwich came with one side, a pickle and a beverage and was only $8.50. (that is SUPER CHEAP for this kind of sandwich) I can tell you the pastrami was better than Chompie's Pastrami. It really was decent pastrami. The bread seemed fresh made and was sort of Arizona style bread and was very soft, mild tasting and fresh. I liked that it was sliced thin like it should be. The potato salad was also very fresh but was also very bland so I added salt, pepper and a little tabasco and it became very tasty.  I took home a potato knish and had it latter. The knish was made with the correct knish dough and was filled with fresh real potatoes that were slightly seasoned. I'm not sure if they put any onions in it and it could have used a small amount of pepper for my taste but was good.  Service was speedy and friendly.  If I could I would give a 3.5 stars based on what I had. The only reason I didn't give four stars is because I'm not a big fan of Arizona Style Rye bread and the lack of seasoning in the the potato dishes I tried.   The prices are very low and portions are large.   Worth a try when your in the area!"}
{"text":"I would give the Deli 5 stars for their cannoli alone! I guarantee you will find the dessert case too tempting to pass up. It's a treat to eat there and then take home a freshly baked loaf of bread. Yum."}
{"text":"One breakfast trip. One lunch trip. One breakfast sausage burrito to go.   The L.E.O. is a nice breakfast option if you want protein and carbs. The sautéed lox and onions with scrambled eggs is basic but good. I don't recall any cheese but it might be a good addition to the entrée. It is served with a toasted buttered bagel - or toast if you'd like. The breakfast potatoes are simple. Portion size is \"Jen\" size (minus the bagel) which is perfect if you are semi-hungry.   The breakfast burrito with sausage is a hearty size and tastes pretty good. For the price and size, I recommend it. (Or at least my hubby does!)  Lunch - more memorable.  The Rachel - featuring a wonderful tasting pastrami is definitely a staple menu item! It will be ordered again or any sandwich featuring pastrami.  The Reuben - very good. Corned beef served piping hot was also flavorful, but pastrami on Rachel was still my fav. Thousand island dressing was on the runny side so it soaked through the grilled/toasted rye bread leading to messy eating but that doesn't matter, I still enjoyed the sandwich.   Both sandwiches were ordered with potato salad instead of fries because delis typically feature amazing potato salads. I think I would try the fries next time though. The potato salad was again simple yet kind of good. I searched for something more but wasn't sure what. Hubby added Tabasco to his, and I was happy adding some salt.   Service? Overall friendly the 3 times we've been there. We sat at the bar for breakfast once and talked with one of the waitresses who actually is also a resident in Vistancia. We lunched yesterday in the dining room area in the back and she served us again, since the waiter in the back was busy with surprise family visitors.   This deli is still finding its groove because that's what new restaurants do! We are always greeted with kindness and friendliness when we walk in. The pastrami is amazing. Side potatoes need some love. We like how you can purchase bakery breads and pastries at the counter. We will continue to explore the menu for other stand outs and give updates and definitely yummy pics as needed."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast it was great! Food was good and staff was friendly. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went today for a take out sandwich ... When I ordered it the gal said it would be 15 min?? Wow ... For a cold sandwich ? Anyway... I waited.... And waited... And a half hour later finally got it!!   Next time I go to Safeway.  They make it in 5minutes. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stumbled into this little gem while trying to avoid a serious dust storm. The sandwiches we ordered; Reuben for me, club for him, were very good. The potato salad was VERY BLAND! I tried to spice it up with some salt and pepper but it lacked any flavor at all.   The service was very good and the owners were extremely friendly. I would definitely return to this deli."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is like a NY deli. We ordered the meat loaf and sausage sandwich with peppers and onions. We had the matzah ball soup, rugalach, and humentachen as well. The food tasted home made. The veggies were cooked till they were very soft, the mashed taters were very creamy, and the gravy was a thick brown gravy. We look forward to going back and trying some different items. The desserts were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Just tried the Jarlsberg Swiss from the Deli, superb! Corned Beef Hash and Breakfast on a Bun are spot on! How nice is it to get a hot breakfast, not one the has been sitting under a warming lamp. Anthony our server was top notch, very polite and most accomodating, be sure and ask for him. Love the service from owners Dina and Mark, they are always on top of their game. Our go to place in the Vistancia area!!!"}
{"text":"If I had the option to rate a \"Zero\" star I would. This was my first experience going to this little restaurant. First impression is key to a successful business. My first impression wasn't to pleasant. As you walk in, you have to wait to be seated. Which is totally fine but the lady at the front/behind the deli counter(owner of the restaurant) was not personable. As someone in the front of the restaurant should greet and be excited that a customer aka a pay check walks into the door. She said, \"What can I help you with\"? My response, \"I would like to dine here\". Seriously?! The woman couldn't say, \"Hi! Welcome in! Or Is there anything I can help you with?\" She belongs in the back behind a desk managing payroll and expenses. She has no business being at the front. After eating(which the food was delicious) I was ready to pay and I couldn't pay with the server. I had to take my ticket up to the front. And guess what?! She's also the restaurant cashier. And the hostess, manger and deli person. Terrible and I don't see this place being open."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat! All the food is so delicious and the staff are very welcoming(: would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Ruben!!! They do a good job when you need food and are in a pinch. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We chatted with the owner and he was so sweet and the food was so delicious and great size portions."}
{"text":"Finally!  A great deli near Vistancia.  I stopped by yesterday to try a New Yorker which wasn't on the menu but is only pastrami, cole slaw, & 1000 island on rye.  All I have to say is it was FANTASTIC!  You can tell the ingredients are top notch.  The atmosphere is really nice and comfortable casual for sure, it is small but there is a bar and seating area for service.  It was only open for its second day when I stopped by but they still got me the food out very quickly.  The have breakfast and I am pretty sure this place will be busy on the weekends for sure."}
{"text":"They're extremely friendly and welcoming. I typically sit and work for a couple of hours, and they're fine with that. It's so much nicer that sitting in a busy coffee chain with the steamer and grinder constantly going off.   The chef does am amazing job with the poached eggs, and their veggie omelette is loaded with veggies. I love that you design your own rather than having to customize a set menu item."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new restaurant in Vistancia! Costumer service  was very good  and the  was very enjoyable!  I will  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! I stumbled upon this little gem late last week and I am so glad that I did. The ambiance was inviting and the service was terrific! I ordered the Romano and the mile-high pastrami with provolone on grilled sourdough was beyond delicious! I will definitely return when I visit the Vistancia area again. Also, pay no attention to those 1 star reviews! Those who can't speak or write with proper English (see Michelle D and Ally P) have no business writing reviews anyway :)"}
