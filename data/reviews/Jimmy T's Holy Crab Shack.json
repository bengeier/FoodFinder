{"text":"Delicious shrimp and king crab. Sauces were delicious as well. Menu was small but contained exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"Terrible. Do not eat here. The boiled shrimp were huge and the service was fine but that is where the positives end. The shrimp  were so over cooked they were disintegrating as I struggled to peel them and were mealy in the mouth. The sauce has a little kick but no salt or flavor, you just got heat from the spice. I ordered potatoes with it, not only were they undercooked but I got 3 for $3.25! I wanted so badly to like his place. We live very close and waited such a long time for it to open but it was a disappointment for sure. I would rather drive the few extra miles and go to Angry Crab."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Don't waste your time or money. We were excited to try this new restaurant after driving by before they opened and subscribing to their emails. We came for an early dinner on a Sunday and it appeared the few other patrons were having as negative an experience as we were. The music was way too loud and not appealing to a cross-section and it is obvious the business owner is trying to get by as cheaply as possible with hiring inexperienced staff, skimping on the quality of the food and even on super-cheap silverware and seafood utensils. While our server seemed to do his best, he was inexperienced and not well-trained. Our shrimp was overcooked, not great on the second try, and not the only order we saw going back to the kitchen, so kitchen staff clearly isn't being trained properly, either. They were out of garlic bread, too. Really?? Worse than the dining experience, though, was witnessing the female Asian owner or manager nastily berating a young female employee who was trying to prepare shrimp cocktail. If we were treated as badly by an employer (lots of angry finger shaking and criticizing), we probably would have walked out. I hope she finds a new job soon."}
{"text":"No specials on Memorial Day.The menu is very small, no alligator and the people on the phone didn't sound very interested on making a customer happy, all the photos show is potatoes and corn. And must I add, it looks very dry and sick"}
{"text":"The service was OK but the food was terrible. My friend ordered the clams. There was a very tiny amount of meat inside of them. I ordered the crawfish. They were overcooked and mushy inside. I would say that there was not even a half teaspoon of meat inside of each one. It was disgusting to see their antennas, legs and eyes. The salad left a lot to be desired. It was a small amount of iceberg lettuce with 2 or 3 grape tomatoes. The Asian salad dressing was sickening sweet. The french fries were ok but nothing special. They were supposed to have parmesan cheese on them but I did not taste any. I do not think I would ever go back there. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed not what I expected at all. Flavor was good but quality of the food so great. Way to expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I like the location, the ambiance is nice, the patio is big and spacious.  There is still a lot of work to be done, mainly in the customer service area. The hostess and server were  not very outgoing. Very basic menu which I am fine with but was disappointed  with portions for the high cost. Unfortunately I will share my business with Angry Crab if I am looking for seafood  in this style. I highly recommend bibs and wash sinks for this place, it is an inconvenience having to open the patio door to get to the restroom to wash hands. Hopefully it continues to grow and improve in these areas."}
{"text":"DAMN!
I really wanted to like this place. This restaurant seems like more of a money grab then a place owned by someone who is passionate about presenting good seafood. This place used to be a Chinese restaurant. And I'm pretty sure it's owned by the same guy. I think he looked around and saw the success of Angry Crab down the street and decided to try and duplicate the business model. It didn't work. It's really hard to describe, you're just gonna have to try it yourself. It doesn't really matter what I write here, because you know you're going to try it for yourself. And you should. Just be warned, if you are an oyster connoisseur. They serve warm water oysters from the Gulf of Mexico. Not cold water oysters from Washington state, or Maine, etc. Always a sign of a seafood place trying to cut costs."}
{"text":"I went with my family to Vlog a new restaurant for our Vlog on YouTube 3 kids on the block on block. The restaurant was good, I pretty much tasted majority of the menu. I asked for mild and In was not spicy so if you want a little kick go up a notch. The service was great no complaints there. It was nice knowing the story behind why it took so long to open. Congratulations to the owners. They are brother and sister! Good luck!!  I look forward to coming a Saturday for the live band"}
{"text":"Really good food. Not a huge menu selection but they do it right. Jimmy T's has a really good sauce. I got hot and it was perfect heat. Kids menu limited to chicken nuggets or popcorn shrimp! Great atmosphere!! Live bands on Saturdays! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Place is ok. Ordered King crab legs. House sauce was spicy good. But no Dungeness crab yet, so I'd not go again."}
{"text":"They're trying to do a New Orleans theme and kind of fail.  The crawfish taste good but a hard to get too because , They do not boil them right!!  The hurricane was nothing like it is in New Orleans. The shrimp were excellent cooked. The overall experience was I think they're trying to be another angry crab and failed. I do not recommend but maybe they'll learn from their mistakes.  I gave them some excellent pointers on the crawfish."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time going, with my husband and 2 children. Absolutely amazing food and service!!! Our waitress was Cassie and she is so freaking awesome!!!!!! We ordered oysters, king crab, shrimp, and crawfish, we also got bread on the side. Ugh, i cant tell how amazing and sumptuous everything was!!!! I dont want to leave!!!! Simply the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. Poor service and way overpriced   
King crab was very expensive and you only got one.   Shrimp was ok but boiled shrimp was hard to peel."}
{"text":"My family saw this place coming for awhile now and was looking forward to it.  We decided to try it last night.  We arrived and there were plenty of empty seats but was told it was a 25 to 30 minute wait.  No problem.  We get seated, order some drinks, order an appetizer, and looked at the menu.  No prices on the menu so you don't know what your paying.  When the waiter comes to take our order, he informs us of all the food they are out of and that the kitchen is behind and its a 30 minute wait for food.  No problem.  We make our, wait for quite some time, then the food comes out.  Well some of the food.  My wife and I ordered a side of corn on the cob.  I mentioned it to the person who brought our food and he said it was coming right up.  It never came so we asked the waiter.  He went and back came out, didn't bring any corn.  The corn never came.  So we ate our food and asked for a bill.  On my bill was a charge for the corn.  It took awhile but the charge was removed.  This was a very unpleasant experience.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful. I just hope I don't wake up in the middle of the night praying to the porcelain god."}
{"text":"Well...I know some of think I'm crazy, after reading the reviews, but believe me- I know where you're coming from. 

Wasn't sure where to eat tonight but came across this joint. I think, if I would have read some reviews, I'm not sure I woulda stopped in. Newish place, outdoor seating...not too big, not too small...open room bar/restaurant area. Greeted by hosts and sat immediately. 

This is where things kinda fell apart. Lonnnng wait for water/drinks. It turned out that they were short a server/waitress. So the host filled in. She was extremely nice and friendly. /part of why I gave 4 stars/ 

There was a big party of about 12-15 which turned out why the long wait...for drinks, service or food. The thing was, was that I was getting ready to write this place a bad review! We ordered from our hostess, again...she was amazing. And again the wait for food. It would have been nice if the Manager and or owner came by to apologize or see how we were doing. But nope. Our hostess saved the day. 

I ordered the catfish and chips...and my guests ordered the crab legs. The catfish and chips were amazing the crab legs were on point. Good food + excellent service = strong review. They pulled it off. New place...hopefully they work out the kinks. i'd go back."}
{"text":"When you walk in you are blown away on how nice the inside looks.  I used to dine at the complex when it used to be a Chinese restaurant and at that point it looked pretty dingy.  However, it now looks so welcoming and modern to all the guests who walk in.  The staff were very friendly and attentive to all our needs.  Though, to get straight to point, lets talk about their food.  It was pretty good, it was significantly better than your average red lobster or joe's crab shack.  However, I have definitely had a little bit better but, I would return and next time I would get the Shrimp at a spicier level and hope they are not out of clams.   That was one of the disappointing things, they were out of clams, but all in all the shrimp was pretty good with nice flavor.  Overall, the food was good and as a result I will be returning, I recommend others try it out to see for themselves."}
{"text":"This is an update, after reading some of the reviews a crooked act is appearing, the Chinese guy told me that the change in price was due to them not having regular crab and having to use\"PRIME\", this seems to have been said on more than one occasion, when they tell you one price they change it using the, we had to use \"PRIME\".  Save yourself the aggravation go to angry crab. 


First, service was lackluster, slow. I was in the night before and was told the price of the snow crab, 20.00 tonight when I got my bill it was 28.75, I complained, a Chinese guy comes over and lies to me telling me that when I was in yesterday the crab wasn't Prime Quality, and tonight it was. Crabs are rated #1 or #2 and has to do with color. He takes 5.00 off the bill. Now for the prime crab, I could not break the crab by hand, I HAD to use the regular fork, I asked our waitress for a crab fork she went a retrieved one, why wasn't I given one to begin with, the meat stuck to the Shell, an indication of being over cooked, I brought that up to the Chinese guy, he didn't offer a solution. The music was to loud and I'm not into rap, bring ear plugs.  
I will NOT GO BACK, 
I only gave it one Star,  -5 wasn't an option."}
{"text":"Excellent market priced seafood and great service. Don't be dissuaded by assholes who expected the place to be perfect on day one of launch. You won't regret trying this place."}
{"text":"Great service (Cassie)  and fantastic food.  Must have mussels!   Will be back soon! Soooo yummy. Loved  the Jimmy T season on snow crab."}
{"text":"First off, we are picky, we lived in the south! This place was yummy! The owner was there and greeted our table, which was nice. We did both snow crab and king crab, pay the extra money for king crab, with the Johnny t sauce. Drinks were great too, daniel the server was great!"}
{"text":"Freshest seafood we have had Arizona in the last 15 years we have lived here. Try the calamari and okra!! Customer service was super helpful with explaining everything! There is even live music at night, definitely will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Its interesting all the good reviews are from people who have only 1 or 2 reviews to their name. What a letdown this is. We do not give unethical restuarants second chances."}
{"text":"We went there on Wednesday night. The place was not too busy. Our waitress was great. We had the snow crab with Jimmy T seasoning and the shrimp with butter and garlic. The shrimp were large and just delicious. The crab was fresh, cooked perfectly and so yummy. The prices were fantastic. Jimmy T stopped by our table and seemed truly grateful for our patronage. He will be expanding his menu soon and he will be open for lunch within the next week."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice and clean, has a bunch of tvs for you to watch, and very beautiful decorations! The food is amazing. I always get the garlic noodles or spicy crawfish! So much flavor and the staff are so friendly. Also has nice outdoor seating and they even have live music on the weekends! New favorite place for seafood!"}
{"text":"Place is absolutely the worst I have been to yet , go to angry crab 100 times better , served me raw shrimp (not on purpose ) server wouldn't stop talking (said he ate dead food everyday for 4 months ) then after they looked at my undercooked shrimp says that \"I don't even eat seafood I ate here 1 time \". Place is a joke so is server (Danny ) and owner (jimmy)   !!!!!!"}
{"text":"1 star is far too much to rate this place . Went there for my mother's day dinner Food took 1 hour and a half to come and they forgot my pesto dish altogether ! Mgr comped our meal , it was a terrible experience our waitress never said sorry. Lousy food , lousy service"}
{"text":"Clean place, cold beer the bartender was cool too bad the food was super over cooked and could peel the shrimp (shrimp zero stars) the oysters were good and the drunken clams with the toast were ok but the shrimp were awful someone needs a new chef. Big fan of angry crab but this place does not have the quality end product"}
{"text":"On the positive side my kids loved the snow crab. As for myself and the wife... I ordered 2 lbs of crawfish Jimmy ts style. For 14.00 a pound of crawfish you would think they were select crawfish. They were tiny barely any meat. And over cooked. And for the wife sheordered 1 lbs of head on shrimp. For anyone that is Cajun or from Louisiana knows that shrimp boil is a little tricky shrimp can overcook and they become mush dough. That's exactly what happened with this shrimp. And when I told the waiter about this he said I could re- Cook them for you. My jaw dropped.they were beyond cooked already. Then he said I can give you a complementary half pound. That's it. Well thanks Jimmy. The waiter was ok no complaints there except when I ordered 1/2 doesn't of oysters he came back 20 minutes later and said they only had 3 oysters.i should of just gone to angry crab. Or hot and juicy. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a good time ended up not. Service was not good, order food on the menu that they said had but they didn't have it.  Recommend angry crab over this place or maybe something else"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING food and service, first time going and will be back very soon......... Garlic fries are to die for...."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening and unfortunately didn't have a great experience. The service was good but the food was not. Crab and mussels cold. Papaya salad not edible. Sides (corn, potatoes, sausage) were tiny and corn not edible. Garlic pasta ok. They may just have some issues to work out. Hoping to see better reviews so we can try again."}
{"text":"New place and wanted to try it. Not bad. Very friendly owner and server . Place was not busy. Good food presentation.  The one thing I think is my concern is price.too pricey. $6 for a pint beer and not much on the menu..not much of variety. Don't think I would be going back. Down the road you could get a small pitcher( 2 pints) of Dos Equis for $6. But I enjoyed the food, but they should look at their price.. that would help."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place - but it was just ok. The crab wasn't very fresh (actually brownish on a few pieces). The clams were very very good though. Overall disappointing  for how expensive it was. Reminded me of Chinese buffet crab. The hot dipping sauce was great! I was going to give it 1 stars but my server Cassie was very nice son I added an extra star. Save your money and go to The Angry Crab down the street!"}
{"text":"Great staff!   Brand new place.  They're open and honest.  Good beer selection.  We love their Spicy Rita.  Cassie is the BEST, but don't tell her because it'll go to her head and ruin her.  She'd be really good if she weren't a Raiders' fan."}
{"text":"My service was excellent and the server was pleasant and helpful.   We ordered mussels, shrimp cocktail and snow crab-- all were delicious.  The bucket of mussels was plentiful and more than we could eat.  The butter sauce and garlic bread were perfect.  

The prices on the menu /given to us by the waitress were the same as our bill- $22/pound . 

Worth returning and did satisfy the crab /seafood craving."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, very disappointing. I had been waiting for this place to open for a very long time and I am sad to say that I will not be going back. The inside was nice and you could tell they were still putting things together but the food was the worst I have every had. They have a very  limited menu since they had just opened. The best thing on the menu was the Parmesan garlic fries. We ended up having to order two because after we sat down we found out they didn't have a kids menu and my daughter was starving. We also ordered 2 pounds of crab and 1 pound of shrimp. The crab was still cold on the inside and the shrimp was mushy and uneatable. You can order potatoes, corn and sausage with you meal. Omg.... the portions were a joke. No flavor and ridiculously small. We left still very hungry. I hope things change for this place. Angry crab is much better."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  We walk in and the place looks like a cafeteria.  We order our drinks and a dozen oysters and mussels. The mussels come in about 15 minutes.  Over a half an hour we get 6 oysters.  After 45 minutes a manager comes to see how everything is.  We tell her we placed an order for a dozen oysters, she goes to check and tells us they ran out but didn't bother to tell her.  More come in and we get the other 6 after one hour.  I am not exaggerating on time.  We got a couple of drinks while waiting and the bill with tip was over $100.  I wasn't going to punish the server for the establishment.  We were going to order dinner but after this experience we did not bother.  We will never go here again!  I even commented to the server and she apologized, never told a manager my complaint and ran my card."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy and his HOLY CRAB... I plan to come to church here every Sunday and ask for Cassie... she's awesome... so is Jimmy!  Loved it.. we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th times here. I really enjoy my French fry my fresh oyster crawfish and my favorite garlic noolde.. I am leaving tomorrow to Ca. Will come back next month."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite seafood sports bar of all time. Music and entertainment is great. Flavors. Fun place to go and hang out while tasting the exquisite king crab with friends and crawfish too ....SPICY various items ....a warning: have to willing to get your hands dirty ....they have gloves if you request them ... they have good beers and sport Chanel's so overall I give them a five for being just opened only a few weeks and get a lots of good attention from media and goers. Way to go Jimmy T's"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place. It's nicely decorated, clean and the servers very friendly. The food was not what I expected. The portion was very small and overly expensive. Needless to say, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Definitely going back to try gumbo when it's available on menu.  Reminded me of crawfish boils when living in Louisiana."}
{"text":"Excellent services for a brand new establishment.  Execent food and atmosphere.  The oyster was fresh.  Love the parmesan Garlic Noodle with Cajun Sausage.  You should try their garlic french fries, it's to die for.  We will come back"}
{"text":"The two stars are because the service was quite good. Good recommendations from the server, and prompt service.  

The food is garbage, and the menu is a joke.  It's a Louisiana style restaurant with no: Gumbo, Jambalaya, or even a simple Po Boy?  You can't even get any kind of rice at all with your seafood.  

The menu is just pathetic.  It's a paper menu that doesn't even list the prices for the main menu items.  This is presented as an excuse for getting \"fresh\" product \"daily.\"  But really, it's a money grab.  You can average our your food costs if you are at all competent at running s business and be up front with people.  At the very least publish them on a daily chalk board since you can't be bothered to reprint the paper menus.  Having this air of secrecy around the prices where they are spoken to the table by the staff individually comes off super shady. 

We had the mussels to start, which... man... do wat better here!  You give a tiny amount of small mussels that don't taste particularly fresh and not even any bread to go with it.  A huge part of why people order mussels is to sop up the sauce with the bread, get with the program.  I corrected this by asking for garlic bread and for $3.75 I got two tiny pieces of sliced grocery store French bread with dried garlic shaked on... man, really?  

Since I was already fed up with the menu, pricing, mussels, bread... I just had wings.  They were OK, like 5 out of 10.  I'd go to Wing Stop instead, that should say plenty.  

My dining partner had the shrimp pasta, looked like velveeta-inspired sauce. Wasn't good. 

I just thought I'd warn you all, and it's a shame that the good servers are being let down by a poorly run business."}
