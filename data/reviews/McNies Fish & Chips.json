{"text":"Best fish and chips so far in GTA!  Love the haggis, steak and kidney pie and haddock and chips special. Been going there for years... the ownership has changed but waitress is the same and the food - great!"}
{"text":"WAS my favorite place for years...but now I have a feeling the ownership has changed...no longer open Sunday..and the portions have gotten a lot smaller..both the halibut and the chips."}
{"text":"Not the greatest.  Was very greasy (even for fish and chips) and totally overpriced.  $14 after tax for an order of fish and chips.  You do get pretty large portions, though.  Also, they don't put any tartar sauce or other condiments in the bag when you order (which I didn't know, being my first time), and they didn't inform me of this, so I left without grabbing any of those things from the self-serve area which was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips place.  Broad assortment of kinds of fish and size of servings.  Also some fun other stuff on the menu, including haggis.

Very friendly staff.  Lots of seating; quick service.  Kid-friendly.  

They also do take-out."}
{"text":"Used to come here often, mostly for their chips.  Sadly have to agree with recent reviews that it has gone down in quality and higher in price - think there was change in management or something.  The last few times we got chips 1/3 of them were the little shavings that get fried to a crisp and not very edible.  Sad to say but we don't come here anymore because of this which is unfortunate as its so close by.  Have been looking at other fish and chip places in the Etobicoke area.  I give 2 stars just because it used to be better ... :-("}
{"text":"Perfect timing on a Friday evening, just after 5 p.m. and hardly anybody eating in but the take out line was starting. We had our pick of tables which are all covered in cloth tablecloths. The eat in area is clean and well maintained. The serving staff were attentive but they weren't very busy either. Service was what was to be expected and the fish was perfect! The fries were a good size and well prepared as well. The halibut was 12.99 which is a lot but it is a bigger piece than what you might get elsewhere. I will return."}
{"text":"It's a classic British chippy.
The fish is always good as are the sides.
Sadly the chips aren't that good in my opinion"}
{"text":"So I wake up on Sunday morning with a killer hang over... Drank way too much for my own good the night before. My girlfriend was feeling just as bad, if not worse than me. So what could be a better cure for this sickness if not some good old greasy food? We decided to go for fish and chips since it's one of the few meals we can always agree on and we found this place which was only 5 minutes from my house. 

We placed the order for pick up and my girlfriend specifically said that we want an additional piece of fish on each portion. After we picked up the food, we returned to my house and realized that the genius who took our order did not add an extra piece of fish as my girlfriend had specified. This was actually a good thing considering the entire meal was THE MOST DISGUSTING FISH AND CHIPS I have ever had. 

I don't usually mind if they put a lot of batter on the fish, but I DO when half of it is still raw. The fish had absolutely no flavor and it was definitely not fresh. The fires were just awful and there was no coleslaw. My girlfriend only took a few bites before she got really nauseous and went to the washroom (mind you it was also from the hangover). I have a much stronger stomach and growing up in Easter Europe, I learned not to throw away food, especially when you pay restaurant prices for it. I sucked it up and finished that meal, getting angrier and angrier with every bite I took. 

At the end of it all I was not happy with myself and I wasn't at all happy with this pathetic excuse for a Fish & Chips restaurant. The only reason I would go back there is to tell the owner/manager that he should look for another career. I also wish I could give this place 0 stars because it was probably one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had, not because it was just terrible in every possible way, but because HOW CAN YOU F**K UP FISH AND CHIPS???? That being said, I eat out 3-5 a week so who knows, maybe I just have higher standards. If you live in this area and want a good plate of Fish & Chips go to Martin Grove Fish & Chips. They have wayyyy better service and they food actually tastes good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and very vintage atmosphere. Food was to my liking, enjoyed it a lot. Food feels a little overpriced by a few dollars though. All-in-all, great restaurant, and I recommend dining in this place if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"For under $10 you can walk out with a decent meal. 

The coleslaw is creamy and refreshing, perfect side to the fries. The fries are nothing special, but they're not bad. What really got me was the fish. I thought it was great. Perfectly fried, not greasy, fairly light, and very crispy. 

For me, a good fried fish has got to be two things - fish and the batter, and that's all you should taste. The batter should be crispy enough to hold the fish in, but not greasy. That's exactly what you get here.

One knock would be that it would've been great to get some lemon wedges with the takeout. Mind you I didn't ask for it, but it's fish and chips - you gotta have some lemon on the fish.

All in all, positive review - 8.5/10."}
{"text":"I will say for those of you who indicate the place is pricy, get to know your fares. McNies serves everything from Hake to Cod to Halibut, one of the most expensive fish but one of the tastiest. I don't always come here, but when we do we thoroughly enjoy the crispy batter the creamy slaw and the home made chips. You can take out or eat in. I prefer to stay and have it while it's still hot. The decor is nothing fancy, I mean it is a  Fish & Chip joint, but it's clean the waitress is friendly (and fast) and you leave belly full. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The management has changed for the worse. Honestly, whoever is running things; he is really rude and I don't know where to begin...

Upon ordering, the guy taking the order; I had to explain like 3-4 times that I wanted halibut with poutine and it was like rocket science to him.  Was it really that difficult? Especially when the other order was halibut and chips with an extra halibut on the side.. 

I got home and saw that they didn't include the extra halibut on the side and called them up and got nothing but rudeness from that manager who answered.  Tried to make it look like it was my fault when I'm the customer having to explain to his incompetant employee what I want a million or so times! 

Might I also mention that when I was standing up front at the counter, I saw the waitress pull my gravy out from a microwave.. That is disgusting, and poured it over the fries and cheese, which there was barely any cheese to even speak of! (IN A POUTINE FOR GOD SAKES!!!)  

Overall crappy service, rude management, and incompetent employees.  The lady with my gravy was the only decent hard working person there who tended to customers with courtesy, something that the rest of staff completely lack of.  I feel bad for her serving the standards which weren't put in place back in time when other management were running the place.  

These people need to sell this business to someone who knows what standard is and how to treat paying customers with respect.. If you don't typically eat the food you serve, HOW do you know what people expect?  

Really gone downhill..."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips but not necessarily unlike you'd find at any good place really. What locked it up for me is the availability of salmon done in the fish and chip style (which would usually be halibut or haddock). I first tried that in BC and LOVED the fact that McNie's offered it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Prices have Skyrocketed! When the cook has time to sit and read a paper at 7:15PM on a Wednesday and there is no one in your restaurant or inline for takeout you need to review your business model..."}
{"text":"Greasy. Overpriced. I had to pay $2.50 extra for coleslaw with my fish and chips. What self respecting fish and chips place doesn't include coleslaw? 
Not recommended"}
{"text":"I am kind of tossed on this one because I do like the taste of the food but I have to say it isn't cheap, I paid over $50 for for 2 small meals and an extra order of fish. Considering it was your basic fish n chips I thought it was kind of steap.

I always do takeout here and the service is eh.... not good but not bad either, really nothing to right home about. Still for some reason I always go back even though parking can be horrible and the hrs arent always convenient.

I still always seem to enjoy the food but I will be looking into some other options I have stumbled on through this site ;)"}
{"text":"The place has a very vintage look and feel to it, the staff is friendly and polite. The food however isn't anything special, tastes like every other fish and chips place, it's good though, but not great. I feel like the prices are a bit too high. I would recommend trying the halibut with coleslaw."}
{"text":"This place changed owners AGAIN and I think it's really going down hill.
Coleslaw is still one of the best I've had, however the fish itself has way too much batter and the chips are overdone and soggy.

I've had better - I'd make the trip to Penrose on Mt Pleasant."}
{"text":"This place strives to be a fish and chips joint, and in that respect it succeeds whole heartedly. Being titled the King of Halibut, that is of course the dish I went for. Along with that were the side of chips, an order of calimari, and a pineapple fritter.
Now, I've had my fair share of halibut being a gigantic Hungarian, so I know what I like. Prepared for me was a big piece of halibut, cooked nice and tender, with a deliciously crunchy fry evenly covering it. The first bite just melted in my mouth, it was flavorful, and unlike many other joints with similar fare, I didn't find myself reaching for the lemon.
I got a bit ahead of myself, because I ate the calamari first. And the calamari was cooked, still a bit chewy which is my preference, and a nice crispy but not too greasy breaded coating. They popped with a nice squid flavor, and I finished off that basket before they cooled, ouch!
Following my halibut quest were the fries underneath, which were a bit soggy from having the fish on top, but that's part of the experience. I don't know what it was, but the potatoes used were nice and fresh, a good solid strip of potato with a golden yellow shell. Two of them were overcooked, but due to the quality of the vegetable itself, was not a turnoff in any capacity.
Finally the pineapple fritter, which is essentially a fried circular slice of the fruit. At first glance it was jarring, because I've had limited exposure to frittered fruits. I took a bite, and the taste wasn't bad, but I felt as though it needed a little extra kick, maybe a sweet sauce, or perhaps powdered sugar. That aside, it's a tasty little snack, for for $1.50, who am I to complain? I enjoyed it, and found myself quite full.
The service was good, but I'm not service critic, I'm in it for the food.
Overall the experience was delicious and clean, and is the standard to which I hold a fish and chips restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been our best find since moving to Etobicoke. We both had Halibut and Chips with a side of coleslaw. It was excellent! Not too greasy. The portions are generous and the halibut was thick, tender and fresh. The fresh cut fries were done to perfection. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and the service was exceptional. We have been there twice now and everything was excellent both times. Worth every cent!"}
{"text":"I have come to McNie's Fish & Chips several times with my family and they really love the many varieties of fish, the creamy but not too sickly sweet coleslaw, the battered mushrooms (OMG! Sizzling, delicious, pop 'em in your mouth!) and the interesting Scottish soft drinks and desserts, such as Irn Bru, an orange flavoured pop, a carbonated lemonade drink and desserts such as snowballs (Yum!) and lemon meringue pie. I REALLY love my battered fish as I had an English Mum and fish and chips is totally my heritage. I'm fussy though, I dislike haddock and sole and greatly prefer cod and halibut. McNie's doesn't have sole but does have the other 3 kinds of battered fish, and they also do them quite well. They have a special platter with 2 large halibut fish plus breaded shrimp & cocktail sauce and battered scallops. THIS is what you come to McNie's for and although McNie's IS pricey, my family all agree the fish selection is worth it. 

Oh yeah, it comes with whole big order of chips with it, but pretend you didn't hear me say that, cause McNie's fries are dry, overcooked and awful. I keep hoping every time I come here that the chips might get better, but nope. I eat a few to show I tried and also, I hate wasting food, but I never come close to finishing them, despite my earnest good intentions. They are, alas, just tasteless, no matter how much malt vinegar (the ONLY kind of vinegar for fish and chips, Yelpers!), salt and maybe pepper that you sprinkle on them. However, the battered fish, battered mushrooms, creamy coleslaw and the snowball dessert are so good that we forgive them the beyond mediocre chips.

PARKING & ACCESSIBILITY: Parking is relatively close and convenient at the back of the strip plaza. We always come in through the open back door of McNie's and appreciate that there's a long row of hooks as you come in the back where you can hang up your jacket or coat in the colder or rainier weather. The washrooms are downstairs because the restaurant is in an older building which hasn't been renovated. So it's not great from an accessibility aspect. I can manage the steps without much difficulty though as they're not that steep."}
{"text":"Nice little family restaurant where even our picky toddler will eat. Portions are a good size with a fair price. Parking is readily available and the server is very friendly. We will definitely be returning again!"}
