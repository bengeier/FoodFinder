{"text":"I ordered spicy chicken curry that comes with tom yum soup, grilled calamari appetizer and a glass of white wine. It was $26 and change with tax in.
Service was ok. Attentive but not very well trained. Breaded calamari was tasty but I realized that most of it was breading and very thin strips inside the breading was calamari. Nice presentation though. On a bed of fresh lettuce in a dish in a shape of a boat. It also had a sauce that was half mayo and I found the mayo too western tasting addition. Soup was very good too. Very comforting on a chill night and just right amount spicy. Spicy chicken curry came in a very big portion and was very spicy. The waitress tried to explain me that albeit not very well. I have a friend who  finds Doritos spicy and I can take quite a bit of heat in my food and this was definitely at my limit if not a bit more. I could not taste the food very much and was sipping water after each bite. I took the leftovers home and warmed it up in coconut cream and that was definitely better. It was just past the dinner hour rush when I finished eating and the restaurant emptied out so I sat sipping my glass of wine watching the world go by outside on the street sans the usual ding of a busy restaurant in the background. My phone was also low on battery so I found an outlet and plugged my phone. Shortly after, the bus boy came and told me that his boss needs the electrical outlet and for me to unplug my phone. It was an odd request that I obliged. When I was on my way out, I passed by the little bench where the outlet was and saw that the owner plugged in 2 machines that were not cordless and battery powered but both had a cord (I would understand if she needed to charge them) so the whole point was that she (owner) did not want me to charge my phone there (and use their electricity). Judging by a comment from the woman with the baby in the review section, this is a good place to come for some cheap thai food but don't expect much from service and having a great experience. If you do, it will only result in a disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food at low prices. Portions are huge. The cooks are thai so you get the authentic feel. Definitely one of the best thai places in town for the price/quality ratio. Don't let the student food court ambiance deter you from dropping in."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Thai food, I am strict with Thai food. Compared with the pad thai i had before, it's not very good,even though it is so far the best pad thai i tried in montreal."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever. I called there for pick up and the lady who answered told me to hold on and disappeared. I waited 5 mins on the phone then tried to call back but, on my first try she said hello then disappeared again. I tried the third time then she finally answered. She told me that she's busy, couldn't answer me and I asked her why she won't tell me on the phone, she said it takes time. Then she just asked me\"so you gonna order or what\". I was surprised but this negative attitude."}
{"text":"Uninspired Thai food. Barely a step above Thai express. Curries lacked spice and were way too salty. Clearly sauce was just thrown on top of some veggies and meat, not cooked together. Adequate but unhelpful staff. It's pretty cheap, so there's that."}
{"text":"Pretty standard thai food. If you would like to have a quick,fix of thai food, this place will be good for you. Had the seafood tom yum soup with rice. The place is not a fancy one as its located in a foodcourt."}
{"text":"Nicely done. The Tom-yum soup had more chicken in it than some entrees I've had in other restaurants.  The red curry tofu was spiced the way I like.  I like that medium-hot banana peppers were used as well as your standard-fare green pepper.  I was expecting tofu that was fried and for it and the vegetables to be coated in a rich, heavy red curry sauce. instead the tofu was cut fresh from the cube, and the dish was lightly sauced: both made this a light, lower-lower calorie meal that was as cloying as I expected. My only complaint was the I would have preferred the white rice be served in a separate dish.  By plating it with the vegetables and curry, the rice tended to absorb the little amount of sauce that was used.  I would definitely come back when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"In short: great flavour, filthy location.
This is probably the best place to get pad thai in the city. It's spicy and sweet at the same time. I like my food spicy but a medium is sometimes too much.  
The fried rice and seafood eggplant are also delicious. Ask for an egg on your fried rice, you won't be disappointed. 
The ONLY downside to Bangkok in the Faubourg is...well it's located in the Faubourg. This mall needs a serious facelift and I've seen cockroaches scuttle by me on more than one occasion. 
Seriously good food but ignorance is bliss, when eating at the Faubourg."}
{"text":"Having been to Thailand, I can say this just about as close to Bangkok street food as you will get in Montreal, great pad thai, amazing curries. 

Inexpensive, most dishes are under $10.

Just be warned that ordering \"spicy\" here means spicy, they don't North Americanize the food, which is what I love about this place.

Note: This review is for the Bankok in the Fabourg on the 3rd floor, not the one a block away on the street."}
{"text":"This one is a tough one for me to rate - I think all of the reviews stating this was the best pad Thai in MTL really set my hopes unrealistically high. It was good and the portions are quite huge but I thought it was just medium.. Pretty typical pad Thai. I think I just didn't find the flavours to be super awesome...which is what I look for when I eat Thai food. You do get a lot for $10... I'd say try it under reasonable expectations!"}
{"text":"Bangkok is something of an unexpected treasure. For one, it's a relatively legit Thai food restaurant - no Thai Express, no close-proximity. (When you buy the pad thai, you can tell almost before taking a bite how real it is. Sensational seasoning!) It's maybe not exactly what I remember, but I'd be surprised to find anything similar in walking distance, if not in the city at large.

Secondly, it's on the second floor of a food court. In Singapore or Kuala Lumpur that's not unusual, but in Montreal, that's pretty surprising. Most stalls would suffer, but clearly, Bangkok thrives. The stall may have various signs up of awards that seem no newer than 5 years ago, but the surest sign of its popularity is the tempestuous line-up of people waiting for their food. When a stall can keep a steady stream of customers to closing, you know it's a level above everyone else.

The downside is service. The counter girls don't quite have a full grasp of their own menu. When you order, you get a number. Which sounds relatively foolproof until they give you the wrong order anyway. Since the average dish is 8-$10, it goes without saying that you should open up in front of their staff before heading out.

I'll be sure to give this place a go next time I'm hankering for Thai food. I just need to make sure they serve what I order. :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 10 years. It used to be amazing but has gone downhill recently, which isn't a big deal because this food court is closing soon anyway. The food here is very hit-or-miss; sometimes it is totally on point and other times it's \"meh\". 

For example, I usually order the tofu pad thai, which is great 90% of the time. 10% of the time, it's mostly beansprouts and not noodles, or the noodles themselves have been undercooked and are \"gluggy\". In addition, the quality of the ingredients used for the pad thai is not what it used to be.

I used to order the yellow curry chicken but stopped because it was like 50/50 whether it would be good or bad. They definitely diluted the sauce with water a lot of the time.

The biggest change is that the customer service became terrible. The woman who works the cash is an awful person. She snapped at my mother when she asked for extra cups for water a second time because the server hadn't acted like she heard. She actually said \"I'll get to you when I'm ready!!\" with a clearly annoyed face and tone. 

I was just here today and asked for some cups for water. She looked annoyed and said \"Take your tray first\" because my pad thai was ready and sitting on the counter. Sorry if I wanted to put the cups on my tray??? I've been coming here for so long, but she clearly does not care about customer service.

Anyways, I give 3 stars because this place was really awesome for many years. If they open in a new location, I hope they hire a new server who does not loathe social interaction..."}
{"text":"Come here for legit pad thai, Tom yum, etc. Good Thai food is extremely hard to find outside it's home country and this place does it very well, quite authentic too. The location inside Faubourg is awful, but it's tremendous value so highly recommend."}
{"text":"When I read that the best pad thai place downtown is in a food court in a sketchy plaza, I was skeptical. But after I tried it, I'm probably not going to any other place; the pad thai noodles were al dante and the sauce was had a great tamarind taste (whereas thai express' noodles are soggy and full of MSG). It's fairly fast and you can do take-out if you prefer the ambiance of your own home. If you don't like bean sprouts, you can ask them to leave it out and also, you can pick the level of spiciness. Tip: If you want to save some money, ask for a cup--they have a giant water cooler at the end of their counter."}
{"text":"What to say, ah the memories... This family-run restaurant was destined for fame early on. Unfortunately the premises have been forgotten. Read my review on the Faubourg.
Anyone still remember the waitress who used to yell at you after getting up from her nap? One moment your waiting to be served and out of the blue she gets up from underneath the counter, \"NEXT!!!\"
I'd eat there often during my Concordia days (1990's) just to see the long line-up in front of Bankok and none at  the Lebanese food restaurant next to it. It was that good! 
If the mother of the clan is cooking, your dish will be awesome. On the other hand her husband uses too many chilies so unless you like punishing your stomach it will hurt.
Just go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am a Thai from Thailand. I read their reviews and went to this restaurant to try it out. Their attitude was so bad and rude service. It was a total of 9 of us and couldn't even defend the fact that Thai people are so nice and their food is delicious. Eating here is a totally different ball game, but they couldn't even take our order right so we had to walk right out. I even wanted to talk to the owner but the employee didn't even allow us to do that. I don't recommend any genuine Thai food lovers to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I only had their pad thai with chicken and thought it was really good! Tasted fresh and flavorful, especially the seared chicken. Only downside was that for a place located inside a rundown shopping mall, it was pretty pricey ($10CAD). But the portions were good sized and definitely left full and happy."}
{"text":"Sad story. Great phad thai. Just discovered that this is hands down the least infant friendly resto in Montreal. Walked in at 5pm specifically thinking we would be able to get out in under an hour, avoid the dinner hour and so minimize any potential disruption. But the baby was in a full-on post-milk deep sleep so we also figured no worries anyway for at least an hour and a half. Resto was 90% empty. Asked if we could have a four-seater and we'd be out in an hour. First the hostess pointed to a six-seater and said \"I can't give you that, it's for six people\". Well no kidding. We pointed to a four-seater next to the kitchen entryway, figuring that would be the least popular seat in the joint anyway. \"No. That's taken.\" We started to look around to see what else we could sit at and the hostess volunteered \"I can't help you. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT I CAN.\" She sure did everything she could to convey the message that we should get the f-ck out of her restaurant. She had an associate, a host who had also tried to suggest a few places to sit but got shot down by his colleague. He was visibly embarrassed. 
Anyway, tl;dr: don't come if you have a baby. Ever.
Post script: afterwards, we drove up to the Hachoir on St. Denis. They welcomed us, and our baby, with open arms. Their food is also amazing, you should try it asap."}
{"text":"This is my favourite thai place! I tell anyone I know who might happen to be in the general area to go here for lunch if they can find it. Near guy, on st catherines, in the door with a dollarama awning, up the escalator and straight ahead.  Order the pad thai.  Vegetable with tofu is my go to, perfectly browned fall apart in your mouth tofu chunks, nice spice level, fresh garnish of lime.  It's heaven on a styrofoam plate.  I normally go with a friend and share; a portion of pad thai, a side (crab cake is my fave), a deepfried banana with condensed milk and coconut bits and two drinks comes to $20ish.  I've ordered the pad thai on its own before and had to take takeaway and they charge for the containor... Its worthy leftovers but better to share in my opinion."}
{"text":"Truly good quality pad Thai. Fact that it is located in a food court helps to keep prices down."}
{"text":"As close as you're going to get in Montreal to authentic Thai street food. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Cash only. Run down mall, hole in the wall feel. The curry comes dumped on too much rice for the amount of sauce they serve. 

Judging by the other reviews, I probably should have picked a more Thai style dish like the pad see ew, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble to go back."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has 4 stars on yelp, if these are real reviews I feel sorry for montreal'ers as the pad Thai was meh at best, eggplant and chicken was just stir fried with fish sauce, chicken yellow curry you get 4 pieces of dark chicken  a half chunk of potato and half a carrot seriously the chef was too lazy to cut the vegetables!

We also had beef and pepper this was closer to Chinese food than Thai,  was quite a dissapoint
Place was dirty you would think the food would be good.  

Best thing was the spring roll sauce"}
{"text":"Bon restaurant de quartier. J'ai mangé un bon plat de panang. Ce plat est savoureux noix coco épicé et la portion très généreux. J'ai goûté à deux pad thai différents; définitivement le poulet est meilleur que le boeuf. Service très rapide et un peu expéditif..On aime les saveurs et surtout le prix . 14$ pour une soupe et un plat de panang incluant le pourboire."}
{"text":"Above average authentic Thai restaurant quality at a foodcourt!!!  Cooked by Thai people and uses real deal materials, not MSG packets like most restaurants in Montreal do.

Seafood pad-Thai was great!!!"}
{"text":"It had been a very long time since I had eaten some Bangkok.  Too long.  So when a friend asked where I wanted to go out for lunch one day in the Guy-Concordia area, without hesitation I offered up Bangkok.  And was I ever satisfied!

Bangkok is by no means fancy.  It's a fast food stand in a foodcourt, a half empty foodcourt at that.  But knowing that Bangkok has been holding steading for 10+ years now, through the various changes and renovations to the space says something.

The food though . . . yum!  For the price, it is an amazing deal.  If you are not absolutely ravenous, lunch at Bangkok could easily become lunch for the day after.  The menu is long, but it's pretty repetitive: various proteins cooked various ways, a few fried rice dishes, a few noodle dishes, a few soups and apps, and that's it.  They give you tons of rice, so choose something with a lot of sauce, like a curry, and you've got lots of tasty saucy rice to fill up on.  Having a tough time choosing?  Pick something off the list of specials, that come with a soup or spring rolls.

A little bit of advice: when you are asked your preferred level of spiciness, be honest, because they aren't joking around.  Spicy will induce tears. Medium is a good level of heat.  Mild still has good flavour.  There is a sign releasing the restaurant of all responsibility regarding level of heat . . . and they mean it."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot back in the day and I always remembered it to be decent.

There is a large variety of choice on the menu, the portions are large, food tastes good, and prices are fine!

Nothing to write home about but basically a nice place to go to when you have no food at home and need a quick and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets, delicious and cheap.  Be warned: the building it resides in has been infested with cockroaches for a long time (the reason why Grunman 78 moved out) - the people in charge of the Faubourg are to blame. However, I can't help but tell myself to forget this fact because this food is A++"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Montreal, really cheap too."}
{"text":"this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal, let alone the best thai i've ever had. everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere, i constantly compare it to bangkok and how i'd just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it was at the Faubourg so I had high expectations when I came here. We had the veggie rolls, the papaya salad, tofu pad thai, tom yum soup and yellow curry chicken. The pad thai wasn't spicy at all but it was still good. The rolls were crunchy but nothing impressive. The papaya salad had too much lettuce at the bottom and not enough papaya. The curry was pretty good. The tom yum didn't have the usual spicy and sour kick. Overall maybe i set the bars too high since the old place was amazing, but I was really disappointed for the food. 

As for the service, the girl was super nice and the food came quickly. The place is not super big and doesn't have fancy decor but it looks clean. It's located in the center of the gay village so it's very accessible."}
{"text":"Bang-on

I rarely like to admit that my sister is right.  But holy mother of dragons, she is.

Over the decade or so she's been in Montreal she's talked about \"the best padthai ever\".  Now, mind you, I'm not a huge Thai food lover.

That said, being as this was likely my last visit to Montreal for the forseeable year or two, I wanted to try it.

We walked to Faubourg, it's sad.  It's like the shell of something that used to be.  I suppose I would characterize it as ghettofabulous, in that it likely was a busy foodcourt mecca, but fabulous traded up leaving ghetto to fend for itself.  It's fending well enough considering there were a lot more people than I expected.  And most of those people were eating pad thai.  My sister got us the made-to-order tofu pad thai for an easy $8.

Then we took a seat in the clean-ish but likely flithy seats.  

Immediately I knew I was in for something special.  It doesn't look like your ordinary, and it doesn't taste like it either.  It was spicy, fresh, savoury, complex, and all around delicious.

Blew. my. mind.

It was the best pad thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Their food is good, but the service I received makes me never want to go back. after receiving my plate I found that there was an ingredient, one not listed on the menu, that I was allergic to. It took me 15 minutes, with another customer helping me support my claim, to finally get a refund issued! Talk about bad service! Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Upstairs in the mall, above the Starbucks. I had the egg pad thai and shrimp coconut soup; fantastic food!  I asked for \"medium spicy\" and got something that was comfortably spicy, which is unusual and nice!"}
{"text":"Ordered via uber eats.

Red Curry w/Beef did not taste like much. The beef was pretty dry and the flavors were just not there.

Pad Thai was oily and quite honestly not very good. It just tasted off. The portion is large, but I would've preferred a smaller portion with better quality.

Overall would not recommend to anyone who has had good thai food before."}
{"text":"Honestly LOVE the pad Thai here! altho over the years i have seen the price go higher and its getting a little expensive. The taste is flavourful and has enough of a spice to give it that nice kick, you can always choose your level of spininess 1-5 stars. Beef Pad Thai was my all time favorite! No other place for really good authentic Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"That peanut sauce though.

Long story short-- I came in here with a few of my hungry friends, who happen to be vegan, and while they were a little bummed to hear that almost all options are prepared with a small amount of fish sauce, the one vegan entree (#90-- veggies and tofu in peanut sauce) was, as I interpreted from their happy grunts, bomb as hell. I had the non-vegan version (with chicken) and it was some of the most outstanding Thai food I've had-- hot, fresh, and flavorful without being too spicy. 

The spring rolls were excellent as well; at least, they were great when I had a cold and leftover one a day later, so I imagine they were pretty amazing when younger."}
{"text":"I love anything peanut sauce, and Cuisine Bangkok's still is the best in the city. Also, Garlic Pepper Squid. Green curry chicken. I like to get spicy or extra spicy and just pick out the hot peppers, putting them aside (it's too hot with the peppers, but on medium or mild I feel that the rice and veggies don't get enough flavor). Spring rolls are pretty great too. 

I tend to stick to veggies, seafood and tofu. The quality of the chicken and the beef are just OK, not fantastic. Squid and shrimp are pretty darn good though."}
{"text":"One of the best Pad Thai and Thai Fried Rice in town. Love it when make it extra spicy!"}
{"text":"Refreshing! Authentic and not too pricey. Amazing salad to start with followed by an honest beef / eggplant main.
The perfection of simplicity!"}
{"text":"I love their pad Thai here ! Probably the best one I've had in Montréal. I usually always get the tofu pad Thai and they give you a generous amount of tofu for $9.50. The noodles are delicious ! They put some almost raw bean sprouts and I kinda like it. It gives some crunch and freshness since the dish is super rich and heavy. Do not underestimate their spice , I got mild spicy and it was more than enough for me lol. 

It is located in a food court and it isn't the cleanest place to go to lol. Just letting you know...  

I would come back and try their other dishes and drinks. They have some Asian canned drinks I've never seen before."}
{"text":"This is the best pad thai in Montreal!However, their tom yum soup and other dishes (curries) are MEH ,pretty bland and unflavorful. Just stick to the pad thais!"}
{"text":"Back for more.

Chicken & Pineapple fried rice is light & fluffy and more subtle in flavor than the pad thais, but the texture is a nice change from the glistening greasy Chinese style fried rices (good in their own right, just different).

Egg pad thai is lighter in flavor than the beef, although I'm not sure if this is just plate to plate variation or if this is intended.  The eggs were scrambled a bit long & dry for my taste, but it probably holds together better this way when mixed in with the noodles.  Overall, beef pad thai is my current top choice."}
{"text":"The Faubourg is in a constant flux of renovation but no matter how difficult it is to find the staircase or escaltor amid the construction, Bangkok, nestled on an unassuming third floor food court, always has a crowd. Now many people love marveling that \"the best Thai food in Montreal is located in a food court.\" They're wrong. Bangkok is not the best Thai in Montreal but it is by far the best Thai for the price in Montreal. Most dishes are between 6 and 7 dollars (compare to 15-18 at the better and fancier Thai places). So it's good food for the same prices you'd pay for a pile of greasy noodles at Thai Express (although I admit to eating there once in a while but that's just because they're practically everywhere)

The food is spicy too. Usually when I ask for spicy, it's not. I once saw a woman trying to return a green curry chicken because she said it was \"too spicy.\" After they tried to explain to her that curry is spicy, she left her hardly touched plate on the table and walked off in a huff.  I laughed and thought to myself (although wished I had the gall to ask her to her face), \"you ordered a curry. What did you expect? If you don't like spicy food, why are you eating Thai at all?\""}
{"text":"Seriously the best pad thai I've ever had in Montreal. My uncle first ordered it as takeout and gave it to me try several years ago and I was in love. It's got a hint of sweet and spicy taste to it. But not too sweet! Not expensive at all. I've tried only their pad thai but they have a variety: shrimp, chicken etc. I always take my family to eat at this place since it's quick and cheap! If you're looking to grab a quick inexpensive bite downtown this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical when my friend said that the best thai food in Montreal is in a food court, but now I'm a believer.  Third floor of the Faubourg (which sort of smells like glue and was creepily abandoned when we went at dinnertime), in the corner, is an incredible gem that should expand and make lots of money because they're so good.

I had the chicken tom yum soup, which was spicy and creamy and hot, then we split an eggplant dish and pad thai with tofu.  The pad thai was very good, a big mound of spicy and flavorful food, while the eggplant was astonishing.  I had never tried Thai eggplant before so I can't really say whether it was better than its other incarnations, but I loved it.  It was almost too spicy and I was very grateful for the heaps of white rice under it.  Super cheap, super good!

Eat here!"}
{"text":"Best pad thai i've had in Canada. Note that medium spiciness can kill many people. If you are not good at it, order it mild!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!!

Luckily for me, I looked at Yelp to see where this place was at.  However, we arrived about an hour or so before closing, so the place was very empty, and we were a bit confused on where to go, we eventually founded it.  The people were really nice and decided to cook our food.. but then again maybe because we ordered a bunch.  I was very shocked when we ate, the food was very delicious.  We had the following:

- Beef Pad Thai
- Chicken Pad Thai 
- Beef basil noodles
- Chicken Fried Rice
- Calamari
- Dumplings
- Garlic pepper mussels
- Chicken Panang
- Beef Panang
- Beef eggplant

Everything was pretty much delicious, but the item that was most memorable was the Panang curry.  It was very flavorful and delicious!  Medium is a decent spice already, if you like it spicer go for it!

I would definitely recommend this place for Thai for its delicious food, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. I was skeptical at first based on the location in Faubourg but the food delivered! My shrimp pad thai was savoury, spicy, flavorful and very generous in fresh bean sprouts. 

2. It is cheap and quick (but at lunch it is always really busy, so expect a 10-15 minute wait)

CONS:
1. The location of Faubourg is not the classiest/cleanest, but if it bothers you, do Take-Out!

2. The system of ordering and paying is at first visit pretty confusing. I had no idea where I was supposed to order. 

OVERALL:
-Get their pad thai for lunch! You will not be disappointed ;)
-Their tom yum soups are sides without noodles, whereas at Thai Express they're meals which I sometimes prefer. So for pad thai, bangkok. Tom yum, Thai express."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! We came here based on the yelp reviews.

Yup, it's in a mall food court, but it's definitely a local, authentic, awesome place. You could bring it home if you prefer not to eat at the mall!

It was absolutely delicious. I can't say I'm a connaisseur of thai food, but once you eat this pad thai you'll know it's MILES away from Thai Express. And I liked thai express but I know it's low of the low.

This pad thai was EXTREMELY complex and flavourful. I ordered it medium and boy was it ever spicy. If you like a bit of spice I'd recommend going much lower than medium. My partner really likes spicy foods and medium was more than enough for him, and at times when he bit into a chili it was way too much.

CASH ONLY. All sorts of great ad-ons for cheap, like spring rolls, fried spinach, tofu, etc. Very small/cheap soups but they are hearty when there is chicken and all in there."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has 4 stars on Yelp! It must be a joke. I usually never write reviews on Yelp but I am so baffled by the NEGATIVE ATTITUDE/ TERRIBLE SERVICE  I received from the counter worker I had to rate this \"restaurant\" (more of a food court kiosk).  First of all, the food is NOT even good, I ordered the Chicken pad Thai ($10.15) and spring rolls (.95/each). The noodles were hard and underdone and was WAY too salty. The spring rolls were filled with just cabbage and bland. Nonetheless, I had gone back and politely asked for more limes (to counter the saltiness) she asked if I brought back my plate, and when I replied no, SHE ASKED ME TO OPEN UP MY HAND AND PROCEEDED TO DROP 2 LIME WEDGES INTO IT. I'm so disgusted. Would never come back!!!"}
{"text":"The food court is closing at the end of the month, so I figured I should write a review before it is too late. I can't say if their pad thai is the best in Montreal, but it is the best I have tried so far compared to Thai Express and Phayathai. 
I ordered a tofu pad thai and they are super generous with the tofu. They used to put a whole fried egg on top, but this time they didn't. I like how the noodle is not too soft: they are a bit chewy just I way I like them. The flavors are on point, not too sweet (the pad thai at thai express are often too sweet). 

Now that they are closing permanently at Faubourg I'll have to find a new spot to get my pad thai... Hopefully they will open in another food court nearby."}
{"text":"The best Pad Thai I ever ate. Fresh home cook style. I love spicy but be aware to not go higher then level 3. Toke level 4 and I was sweating like I was at the gym.

The decor is simple and warm.

Must try!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food that cannot be enjoyed on premises due to the overpowering aroma of room \"odorizer.\"  It's really intense and terrible. The owners must have no sense of smell. It's ruining their business because I know many other people who stopped going there for the same reason.

MY PLEA:  PLEASE REMOVE YOUR HORRIBLE ROOM SCENT GENERATOR!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Pad Thai in Montréal but is incredibly spicy. The other dishes are not as great however. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical about finding the best pad thai in Montreal in a little gritty food court but had to give it a shot.  I have to agree with all the positive reviews,  this was one of the best pad thai's I've had. It tasted amazing, was very filling and was at a good price. I'm really glad I tried Cuisine Bangkok while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai and there are a few options in the city but my partner and I decided to go with Cuisine Bangkok because we were going to see a concert at l'Olympia afterwards. The decor is a little cheesy and nothing too special but I'm not too picky on that if the food is good; which spoiler - it really was. The prices are also very cheap so if you're really hungry, you don't have to worry about spending a fortune. We ordered the chicken dumpling appetizer which was bomb and the Chicken Pad Thai was amazing as well. The portions are very plentiful and the service is pretty fast. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for almost two years now and I was shocked to find out that their vegetarian dishes contain fish sauce. After ordering here several times I was never told or even asked if fish sauce was okay. I was very disappointed. If they are going to advertise a dish as veggie then they should let it also be known that the dish contains fish sauce. On another note the pad Thai is actually amazing. Too bad they don't accommodate to vegetarians."}
{"text":"I went to Cuisine Bangkok after hearing from my friends and seeing a lot of posts on Instagram and online about how they have one of the \"best\" (some people said they have the best) Pad Thai in Montreal. I was really looking forward to it since I love Pad Thai! 

Cuisine Bangkok is located inside Le Faubourg's food court and besides Pad Thai, they have a wide variety of dishes, ranking from green curry to fried rice, from salt and pepper shrimps to tom yum soup, and so on. I've already decided that I wanted to eat their Pad Thai, so the other options were discarded! They have different Pad Thai: tofu, chicken, beef, shrimp/seafood and vegetarian (if I remember correctly).

I opted for their chicken Pad Thai. When it came, I was surprised at the quantity of noodle they gave, it was pilled up pretty high! BUT, when I sat down and started to eat, I realized under the so-called \"thick layer of noodle\" was an even bigger layer of bean sprouts. I felt cheated a little bit but for the price, it was understandable in a way. I was disappointed with their Pad Thai, there wasn't anything special about it, it was just slightly better than Thai Express (they just have less sauce than Thai Express, so the noodle weren't soaked inside the \"pool of sauce\" like the latter place). I don't think this is the best Pad Thai in Montreal. Indeed, this place and their Pad Thai are a bit overrated.

P.S: You have to pay an additional fee for takeout box (which surprised me because I've never been asked to pay for takeout box before...)
P.P.S: Beware, the lady at the cash could be pretty rude and impatient. I asked her a couple of questions and she was annoyed. She clearly showed me her \"annoyed\" face and elevated her voice when she replied me. I mean you are in a restaurant/service industry, I expect you to at least me patient when customers have questions. The service was in general bad.

Conclusion: I would not return to this place for their Pad Thai and for this kind of service. I've had better ones in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Good pad Thai gai, large portions. They used dark chicken, which my boyfriend liked, but I would've preferred white chicken. Also tried the spring rolls which were good, not too greasy. It's located in a food court with other Asian restaurants which were mostly closed when we got there at 8:30pm. There's a Dollarama next door which is convenient."}
{"text":"The food court is a little sketchy in places, but it is clean and has free bathrooms and wifi. As for the restaurant - great chicken pad thai and crispy noodles. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"So super tasty and so friendly, I need to come back and try more of everything. The Tom Yum soup is that taste I've been craving since I was a Dawson student and used to go to the Faubourg many times a week for my fix. The Pad Thai was plentiful and thick with flavour and honestly tasted even better the next day. The room is simple and when we got there at 9pm we were able to grab the last open table before a line congregated at the door again. Inexpensive, beers on the menu, nice chill room and the most perfect handmade spring rolls I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Flavourful pad thai, much better than Thai express. However the raw bean sprouts were big turn-off for me. 
Also tried their fried tofu and squid, both were very good, their sauces were spicy mayo and peanut sauce. 
These fried items taste just like restaurant quality food but half of the prices. 
I can only give 3 stars as the pad thai were kind of greasy and the building was really sketchy."}
{"text":"When you crave for that authentic pad thai, hands down, this is the place you must go! The portion is big, the meat is there and the taste is amazing. Beware when you say \"spicy\"... It's legit spicy. Even my friend who is from Thailand said it was the \"closest pad thai to home\". Also their super super mental spicy sweet chilli chicken wings are delicious. Tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"Service: The lady who works as the cashier seems like she does not like her job. She is very rude, unfriendly and unprofessional.

Food: I ordered the chicken green curry and I didn't like how the sauce was poured directly on my rice. The curry should of been separated from the rice in a bowl. The sauce soaked up all in my rice and it was really mushy. My boyfriend ordered the pad Thai and it was good. It's not so cheap even though it's from a food court. Prices are average 10$ per dish before tax.

Ambiance: The place is dirty and there's lots of students eating."}
{"text":"I went to Bankok by chance as I was here at the Fauborg with having some Ramen in mind to try,  but the restaurant was not ready and the owner said it would have been another 30 min.  I didn't feel like waiting so I decided to keep walking to Bankok as it intrigued me.  

The woman at the counter politely had a system in place.  Place order at one station, pay at another.  With my cash payment they provided me with a number for my order.  This impressed me, as organization at a restaurant shows me a sign that either they are usually super busy and need some system or they are just organized people!  

After reading a few previous Yelp reviews I decided to go with the Pad Thai Chicken for my lunch.  At ordering I was asked how spicy.  Since spice to me is relative I asked how spicy is their medium.  The girl mentioned it's pretty spicy for most.  I asked about their mild and she said there is no spice whatsoever.  So I went with the medium.  After I ordered I saw a funny sign above that read \"we are not responsible for the level of spice you have ordered\".  This to me is hilarious!  I can only imagine other people have gone back and said \"I can't eat this it's too hot! Give me another\"!  No dice for those!  The Pad Thai was one of the best I have eaten!  Lots of flavour and wonderful perfect amount of spice!  Really delicious!  

Now I've seen that they had possibly problems with cockroaches in the past.  I don't care, and will give credit and hope they have resolved their issues!  Who knows if they didn't I'm sure the health board would have stuff them down!  The Pad Thai was so good I need to go back! This is seriously how a Pad Thai should taste!  For $10.86 taxes in how can you seriously go wrong!  The hot version should only be eaten by a true Thai or someone who can handle a 5 alarm chilli sans water!"}
{"text":"Easily accessible by metro, big portions, outdoor patio. What more do you need in a Thai eatery? I had the mango salad and pad Thai. If you're looking for great flavours, this is the place to go! It was exactly what I had been looking for in Thai food while visiting the city. 

The service was also excellent!  Wet attentive staff and the food came fairly quickly. Great little place!"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from here one night when it was too cold to go out... so my boyfriend went and picked it up. (They don't deliver nor do they use Uber Eats.)

We got the yellow curry chicken and the basil beef. Both were quite good. 

Next time we're in Montreal on a cold winter night, we'll likely order from Cuisine Bangkok again."}
{"text":"Order the pad thai medium spicy with chicken. It's cheap, delicious and you'll be hooked in seconds. 

That is all."}
{"text":"Best thai food you can get in town! Forget about going to the restaurant to get your thai food, this is the place to go! Food is 5* but I deducted 1* for the service.

People are right about the lady taking your orders...she's a bitch  (there are 2 ladies working there and I think everyone is referring to the paler skin chubby one). You go there for he food and not the service...that's why the food is so affordable. If you want better service, then they might need to boost the price :p

Cash only!
You pay extra if you want to do takeout and u need to tell the lady when you order!"}
{"text":"Cuisine Bangkok reopening is the best thing that happened to be so far in 2017!!!

Let me tell you how sad I was when they closed down last year...I used to go eat there a few times a week. Willing to drive there during my lunch hour, struggled to find & pay for parking just to get that deliciousness (drooling as I'm writing this and remembering the taste of each dish).

Sometimes when restaurants close and reopen, taste isn't quite the same anymore. Well fear not as this is not the case for Cuisine Bangkok! Decided to bring a friend along to this special moment...having cuisine Bangkok for the first time since they closed. We were overly confident with how much spice we could handle. We asked for 4x spiciness and been asked a few times if we were sure as this is extremely spicy! Like 2 idiots, we said yes. Oh dear Lord it was spicy (and good)!!! We were sweating like there was no tomorrow, blowing our nose every bite we take. My friend has a shaved head and you could see the sweat on his skull :p

Every surrounding table including the staff was looking at us...most probably laughing at us from the inside lol

The Pad Thai is the best you can get...I've been to Thailand and I still prefer the pad Thai here! The noodles are just of the right texture, not too much sauce as it is supposed to be a bit dry. There is also the right amount of tanginess to it.

I could write a review on every single dish on the menu, but seriously everything is good there so just order them all!

Hey as a bonus, they now accept debit and credit plus the service is now pretty decent."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite Pad Thai restaurants however it's going down hill.

Unfortunately with the bad service attitude from the counter, it is difficult to convince one to come back for a Pad Thai that costs over $10.

The pad Thai looks stacked, but in the bottom it's all bean sprouts. Their green union is cut horribly - huge pieces which I can do better - and I only got 3 pieces of shrimp - yes only 3.

There's an extra charge for take out box and extra sprinkled peanuts. I am disappointed and doubt I will return unless their attitude improves at the counter."}
{"text":"By far, the worst food and service experience I have had. I was craving some yummy and authentic Thai food so I decided to check this place out with my friends on a Saturday night. I have travelled around quite a bit and have had some amazing (ok, a lot of amazing) Thai food experiences. I am a Thai food lover so you can imagine how high my standards are when it comes to Thai food. I ordered veg tom yum soup to start. After waiting impatiently for 5 minutes, I get my tom yum soup. It didn't even look appetizing but I still tried it. The soup tasted like some fish soup. I made my friends try it to make sure it wasn't just me. They got the fish taste as well. I asked our server to take the soup back because it didn't taste anything like tom yum soup. She replied, \"it says on the menu that our dishes may contain fish so if you don't like the taste of fish then you should have told me when you were ordering. Also, not sure what kind of restaurants you have been to, but we make authentic Thai food\" . I did not expect that kind of an insulting response from a server at a restaurant. My friends and I were speechless. For our main dishes, we got chicken pad Thai and chicken fried rice (forgot to take pictures because of being in a state of shock). Both dishes looked decent but didn't taste half as decent. The pad thai tasted very dry and the noodles tasted like they were tossed in paprika. It was absolutely horrible. The chicken fried rice was better than pad Thai but was still ok and had a very strong taste of fish (again). I didn't even eat much there and I still felt sick. This is the best part: we decided not to tip at all because both service and food were horrible. Service was even worse because of the way our server behaved with us. We all felt very offended. The server told us that service charge (tip) was not included in our bill. To which we replied that service charge is for good service which we didn't get at all. Instead we felt insulted. She continued to argue with my friend. Impressive, right? Wow! When we asked for a manger, they told us there was no manager. We then tried asking for the server's name, which again we didn't get. Good customer service is more important to me than the food. It's not just about the food, it's the whole experience that matters. Even a little smile on your server's face makes a huge difference in their quality of service. Long story short, 2/4 people walked out feeling very sick.  Never going back to this place. We had to go to Cacao 70 to get rid of the disgusting taste we had in our mouths."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical of this place because of the location, but luckily we were pleasantly surprised. This place had the best Pad Thai we have ever tasted. It was very flavorful. It wasn't too greasy and the portions were huge! The price can't be beat either! We definitely want to go back for more before we head home."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had seafood PadThai and the coconut water drink was good too.  Overall the food was great according to the price. Great Value! They adjust the spice to your taste. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here more times than I can remember. Yes - it's in a run down food court. And yes, the service isn't the best. But who cares when the food is this good? 

The servings are huge too. Usually we share a pad thai, and get an appetizer and dessert. The fried banana coconut dessert is cheap and delicious. The crab cake is great, and the vegetables rolls are tasty. The pad thai will keep you coming back for more. It's spicy, light, and just greasy enough. The cheapest and tastiest Thai food in town."}
{"text":"Convenient location. Very large portions. 
We had green papaya salad, basil chicken and pad Thai.  I like the basil chicken more than the pad Thai.  Green papaya salad looks huge with a decent presentation. 
Many people here to get takes out so it may not look busy but the waiting time isn't short compared with other Asian restaurants. 
There are some special combos with free tom-yin soup or egg rolls."}
{"text":"The food is great. Not much ambiance tho and when we were there they had no alcohol permit. The food is good tho. Next time will probably get order to takeout"}
{"text":"Great place with authentic thai food. The pricing is fair and the food is freshly cooked. 
The place is cash only, however. 

For anyone looking for real thai food in Montreal, this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best budget thai food in Montreal. 
The new location has a nice atmosphere. 
The food is authentic and spicy to the right amount. 
Thai basil chicken with an egg top is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"I've been craving for Bangkok Cashew Chicken rice for a longggggggggggg time and I finally had it. I went to order a takeout and brought it back home.

Unfortunately this time I'm a bit disappointed, I've specifically told the waitress that I want it spicy with XX, which is the code they usually use, XXX being extremely spicy, XX tolerate spicy, X for mild and none for non spicy. Well mine was actually non spicy at all which quite a bummer, I drove all the way there from downtown to have this.

Hopefully next time will be better."}
{"text":"The food court is really in a sketchy mall but this place is a gem. Ive only tried their pad thai and it is gold.

If you need a food break from all the walking, this place will feed you with the needed carbs and deliciousness youve burned."}
{"text":"This is THE best Thai in Montreal. yeah, it's in the middle of a grungy food-court but don't let that fool you. Their Pad Thai is out of this world, and yes they use huge plump, juicy shrimps, not this cheap Matane shrimp crap.
They make everything to taste, if you want nuclear-hot, you got it. if you want mild, you can get that too. Their Beef with Aubergine, Shrimp Pad Thai, deep fried tofu, coconut water drink, all of it is simply amazing.
Montreal has always had a problem with authentic Thai restos, either overpriced, or not authentic. Do yourself a favor and come here for your spice fix!"}
{"text":"This is still the same magical Thai food they used to do in the food court of Le Faubourg St. Catherine only now they are located in the Gay Village and they finally accept debit cards. I had my usual here, Shrimp Pad Thai medium spicy and there has been no change.  The same Thai auntie and her husband still oversee the cooking and make sure everything is done right.


The only change is that it is now a sit-down Resto which still does take-out.
Another reason to come to the village more often!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Montreal. I was in Bangkok a month ago and this is really, really close to what you can get on the street. 

The cooks are are really Thai, they import many things from Thailand (Try the imported coconut water - delicious!) and know what they are doing.

Considering other Thai places in Montreal actually use vermicelli in place of flat rice noodles for pad Thai, you may find that having authentic Thai isn't what you're used to.

However, if you're not from around here and have a craving for good, properly made Thai food, this is it."}
{"text":"Cuisine Bangkok has the casual, kitsch atmosphere I like in a Thai restaurant. The portions are big and comforting. They offer daily specials for $9 (choose between meat or tofu) which come with a starter, and they have plenty of vegetarian options including our favorite, crispy fried noodles. I'll return and try the Pad Thai with looked impressive on a neighboring table."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a cheap take-out meal, very salty, the pad thai could be as good as Mtl's pad thai can get, there's big chunk of tofu, chicken and prawns and they are the tasty ones not the frozen ones, very impressed. Coming back from Thailand it's hard to bring down the bar and trying to find the best Thai in Montreal, very hard. The order from the phone was not very friendly, they ran out of papaya salad, very disappointing. Will order again once they have it. No delivery."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a decently sized restaurant located in the Gay Village. It's a nice little place but no decor really stands out.

FOOD: Honestly, the very first time I came here, it was spectacular. BEST Pad Thai I've ever had. However, every time I came back, something just kept going wrong. One time, I had sour tofu in my meal and the next, when I asked for spicy, it wasn't spicy at all. I keep getting disappointed but hopefully things will pick up. I'll still keep coming back though!

PRICE: Everything is pretty affordable. The portions are also pretty big so it is reasonably priced. 

SERVICE: Service was good. I usually take the food to-go but overall, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I ever had. Highly recommend shrimps with garlic and pepper. Can ask for extra beef if really hungry. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai in Montreal!! A small family business, no frills, just amazing Thai food !"}
{"text":"I'm sure the rest of the menu is just fine but I really don't care if it isn't. This place has the best Pad Thai I have ever had and that includes many recommended places all across Thailand which have been said to have the best Pad Thai (most of them were really good too).
I would debate long and hard on giving up my first born for the recipe to this Pad Thai sauce, it is so amazing whether you choose to have it mild or very hot you'll truly be amazed at how awesome this Pad Thai is. Go try it now, you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"This gem has been around for a long time and started off in le Faubourg's food court back in the day. Thankfully, they moved to the gay village, so you can enjoy your meal in an actual restaurant. 

If you're a Pad Thai lover you MUST try this place!!!It's by far the best Pad Thai in town out of all the ones I have tried to date. I've been sticking to the shrimp and haven't tried other ones. Their tum yum soup and papaya salad is also good. 

Service wise they're okay but the five star is really for their pad Thai. Don't expect Ritz service but you are guaranteed to fall in love with their shrimp pad Thai. 

Enjoy!"}
