{"text":"love the vegan flavor options and all organic toppings.  can't wait to go back and get more coconut!! and try all of the others!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place 0 stars and I did not even have an opportunity to try their product.  I approached their stand at a street fair and watched them making liquid nitrogen desserts.  The person in front of me asked for a flavor (the same one I was going to order) and the man made it, filled a heaping bowl of the dessert, and gave it to the customer.  Looked delicious.  I order the same flavor.  The man looks into the bowl and sees that there is not enough, and says \"I will make some fresh for you.\"  Good, that is the point of your whole gimmick, right?  He then looks around for things, looks up at the number of people, and begins scraping the bottom of the mixing bowl from the last batch.  He takes out the mixer and scrapes it off, really pulling from the dregs.  He then manages to fill the cup 3/4 (which is maybe less than half of what he gave the person ahead of me) and tries to hand it to me.  While he was doing this I asked if he was going so still make it fresh, he ignored me.    That's pretty lousy, but here is the bad part.  He tried to push this yogurt on me and acted incredulous that I was not going to pay for that crap.  I wasn't even going to take it from his hands.  I had to suffer the embarrassment, in front of people I was wish, of this whole ordeal.  Buying frozen yogurt should not be so complicated.  That behavior is unacceptable and rude, and so I recommend that people stay far away from these idiots.  If this man was the owner, I hope they go bankrupt.    BOOOO."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The vegan options are amazing and there are so many toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"Simply delightful. The frozen yogurt bar is what you'd expect, but with superior organic/vegan options and flavors. All the toppings you could ask for. The staff is super friendly. And now they also have liquid nitrogren ice cream?!?  Only reason it's not 5 stars is that it's a little pricey. But you pay for quality, I guess..."}
{"text":"A great place to treat yourself!  Everyone was super friendly and the icecream was delicious.  We definitely hope to go back one day."}
{"text":"The vegan options are a nice touch. The fruit toppings are all fresh and not covered in syrup. Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best froyo in the city. You can taste the difference with it being organic. Great selection of toppings! Love the Liquid Nitrogen!"}
{"text":"Piccadilly is what you would call gourmet frozen yogurt. Like most other fro-yo places, it's self-serve, pick your own toppings and pay by the weight. There is a large selection of vegan and/or organic options so it's great for those who are health-conscious. The space is rather large so getting a seat shouldn't ever be a problem. And the decor is super cute, rustic and country-chic.  Most flavors I tried were delicious and you can taste the difference that quality ingredients makes. However, I wasn't too crazy about the vegan pineapple flavor but I do like that they have the option for non-dairy eaters. My favorite yogurt was the pomegranate and the tart was a close second. The fruit toppings were ripe and fresh and non-fruit toppings were varied and abundant. One cool thing I haven't seen anywhere else is that they have dividers for your cups which is great when you don't want your flavors mixing. However, I found that they require you to pour your yogurt with more precision which I'm just not about, so I did away with it.  Overall, I really enjoyed the yogurt here and I definitely will be back when I'm in the area. My only reason for docking a star is for the price. My and my husband's cups came out to a bit more than we usually pay at other places. You're paying for the quality here and I can't argue with that. Piccadilly is definitely a treat."}
{"text":"Great fro-yo with organic options. Comparable in price to chain fro-yo."}
{"text":"Easily the best froyo joint in the city.   Not only do they load up their toppings bar with a vast array of fresh fruit, quality candies, nuts, etc., but it always kept stocked and clean. I'm always shocked at how well-kept it is, especially with all that self-serve action going on.   The big deal, though, is that they have VEGAN (DAIRY-FREE) froyo and it's made with organic coconut milk--no horrid soy or gritty nutty almond milk. And guess what? It is amazingggg.   It's a sweet spot (ha) that always looks bright and cheerful, even during the colder months. We drive quite a ways to get here from the East End, but it's so worth it.   Oh, don't forget a cup divider so you can split your cup into a couple sundaes, if you'd like. (:"}
{"text":"Piccadilly is a refreshing change from the usual froyo. All of their yogurt offerings are organic,vegan or both!  I was greeted by their very kind proprietor and a beautiful decor. The chalk lettering on the signage was neat and impeccable.   The dividers available allowed me to try 4 different kinds. I had the sweet cream,salted caramel,chocolate-which I topped with natural peanut butter-and tart topped with honey and pecans. All were fabulous but the sweet cream was AH-mazing!  There are no artificial flavors or colors in Piccadillys yogurts. I wish I could say that was standard for all our foods but it not. Here's hoping to seeing the freshness of Piccadilly spread to all of our treats!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much and I'm so upset to learn they have just announced they are closing. It was so convenient to walk by and they had the best coconut milk-based ice cream and froyo. *cries*"}
{"text":"Went here for a Holiday event hosted by my place of work, they were Super Sweet and Kind to me even though I was an hour early they still let me hang out. I cant wait to see them soon with my new baby ;)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this wonderful little fro-yo shop, not only because the yogurt is better than average, but because the offerings are healthier than most. You can go with the usual dairy based fro-yo, but they also offer a dairy free frozen product made with coconut milk that's delicious. For their dairy yogurts, they are sourcing local milk from cows that aren't given bovine growth hormone, and I really appreciate that. The staff is knowledgable and helpful, and seem to truly enjoy talking about the product and the store. This is a welcome addition to this stretch of Liberty Rd., which has a lot of local and interesting businesses."}
{"text":"This is great.   I think this stuff may taste better than ice cream. I've not tried all the flavored yet, but even vanilla bean is just tops.   They have lots of toppings, but you know this!  But the fresh fruit looks so fresh and they keep the whole toppings area so clean and nice looking, it really adds to the experience.   Give it a try and let us know what you think."}
{"text":"Vegan, local, organic, and tasty frozen yogurt options. Super cute store front and lots of space to sit. Fresh fruit toppings were really fresh."}
{"text":"Super awesome frozen yogurt spot!  Delicious yogurt and toppings, beyond family friendly, amazingly clean and very helpful employees.  Our family loves getting treats here and hanging out.  Huge fan and well worth the money.  Chai tea and vanilla bean are my favorites, and the organic chocolate is great."}
{"text":"Love that they have vegan options! Super cute place! They have a laminated list at the front that shows everything that is vegan and gluten free with the ingredients listed! Will definitely travel to the south hills to visit this place! Staff was also very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"My place is truly top-notch. The friendliest staff you could imagine (many of them are high school kids and I am consistently impressed by their manners and willingness to help), amazing assortment of toppings and flavors, and a clean, fun indoor eating area. I'm a regular here and can't say enough positive things!"}
{"text":"The name is silly. But this yogurt is no joke. Huge chunks of fresh ingredients to throw in. Place is awesome."}
{"text":"Good ice cream, nice employees. However they need to watch the children, actually teenagers who sit in the back and are obnoxious as all hell. Parents please supervise your teens or at least teach some manners."}
{"text":"The staff members are super friendly and helpful! They had a ton of inventory and selection. Anything and everything was there. They can even convert you frozen yogurt into nitrogen ice cream! Very cool! Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I really do love the whole concept of these fro-yo places.  It's fun to pick your flavors and toppings.  As an added bonus - the yogurt at Picadilly is made with better ingredients.  I don't go here because it's organic, but since it is, it makes me feel better about eating a giant bowl of dessert!  The yogurt is really good, the store is well kept, and the staff is friendly.  I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"My first time here. I tried their Strawberry balsamic ice cream made with LIQUID NITROGEN right in front of me. It's GREAT! !  ie. Italian Gelato? Since it's all fresh fruit next time I'm going for Banana.  I'm staying with the liquid nitrogen ice cream. It's sooo groovy!"}
{"text":"Adorable and unique frozen yogurt place.   The yogurt has a stronger milk taste than your standard froyo-chain yogurt, presumably because it's organic. Flavors are creative and seasonal, such as peaches and cream, pumpkin, and spiced chai. Vegan options offered as well.  The toppings included all the usual suspects, plus hot fudge and a house-made Apple compote. The cups come with dividers to separate different flavors and toppings, which is a clever idea.  Cute decor, space in the back for small events. Staff was friendly and helpful. Worth a visit if you are nearby."}
{"text":"This place is really groovey . . . I like it a whole lot.  We stopped in last night to participate in Trivia Night.  We had six people on our team, and we got there early so we would all have enough time to figure out what kind of frozen yogurt and toppings we wanted.  Almost all of the fro-yo is organic, and we were also told all of it is gluten-free (one person in our party has a wheat allergy).  There are dispensers on the wall, and you pick a cup and self-service pour what kind(s) of yogurt you want.  Afterwards, you choose your own toppings, and it is weighed and price is by the pound.  I opted to pay $1 extra for a waffle cone in my bowl (money well spent in my opinion).  Everyone in our party really enjoyed their treats, and then the trivia game started, and it was a lot of fun.  Our team came in second place, so we won $15 worth of yogurt gift cards . . . YAY!!!  We will surely be back, not only to use our gift cards, but also to play some of the cool board games they have here, and enjoy the delicious organic treats.  We also hope to come back again if they do more trivia nights in the future.  Very cool place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Really. Not your typical yoghurt place.  The yoghurt is smooth, tasty, and not too sweet (but sweet enough!). All great ingredients including organic and grass fed milk for the non-vegan options.  The \"local tart\" flavor was superb; paired it with the pumpkin, which was also perfect (just the right amount of spices and not overwhelming."}
{"text":"The vanilla bean fro-yo was amazing, and we got 3 generous servings (myself, husband, and MIL) for under $10 - very, very reasonable price for an awesome product and a beautiful space.  Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Piccadilly is simply amazing. The froyo here is organic and vegan and (even better) the feeling I have after I eat it is 100% guilt free. Who knew froyo could make you feel good?!   I'm usually only in the area during the summer, and easily go every other week plus. I highly recommend the salted caramel and sweet cream flavors, and I never come here without adding the organic peanut butter and cookie dough on top!!"}
{"text":"Great spot, great people watching and AMAZING for vegans.   This place is nestled right in the centre of the hustle & bustle of Lebo. An upscale neighbourhood that has a lot of walkable districts and the one Piccadilly is located in, in particular actually has TWO competitors across the street.   What's the best part? Well, there are usually at least 2 vegan options for soft serve AND there are a tonne of fresh fruit toppings...while I wish that there were more vegan toppings this actually helps keep the calorie count down.   Love that it's all organic and the staff is supper friendly. The only thing I can complain about is that the self serve/buffet topping area is made super messy by young kids and I wish that there wasn't cross contamination due to that. When the dairy mixes in with the fruit etc...it's kind of annoying/rude.  But all in all, as a vegan option for PGH, I love it."}
{"text":"As many have said, good Fro-Yo and organic options.  Service is helpful and friendly.  Can't believe I have not posted a review before this.  Anyway, great flavors.  Self serve.   But similar to many Fro-Yo places on the expensive side!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that Piccadilly was coming to Pittsburgh! I went to the Piccadilly Creamery in Cleveland and LOVED it! It turns out this is an independently owned store, but under the same umbrella as Piccadilly in Cleveland. The decor is very similar and SO CUTE! It's actually how I first noticed it while I was driving down Washington Road. It looked just like the Cleveland shop and then I noticed the name!! I love the Pittsburgh skyline made from distressed wood. So clever! The signage, tables/chairs, and photo booth make this a quirky, cute shop that really fits into 2015! It's like every inch of this place was made to be snapped and posted to Instagram. Speaking of that, I wish they had a better presence on social media. I worry that places like this will fail without a strong social media presence in this day and age. And I don't want it to fail!!   The yogurt is SO GOOD! The first time here I tried the pomegranate (made from the actual fruit!) with some vanilla. I topped it with fresh fruit, granola and...nutella! The second time I tried the salted caramel with cheesecake bites, brownies and more nutella! My toppings might not have been the healthiest choice, but it's on yogurt so I justified it! There are so many good choices for the yogurt (even vegan options using coconut milk) and for the toppings.   The first time here I spoke with the owner's son and then the owner. Both were really nice and I loved that they said if this store is successful they want to open an actual creamery. The one in Cleveland uses liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream to order! I hope they can bring that to the Burgh! I think it would be so successful in Lawrenceville!   I'll be back again and again and again! Hey it's organic yogurt!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the owner, Lyl Rose, is one of the most dedicated, hardworking people I've ever met, this artisan yogurt shop is the best I've ever experienced. The store has a personalized touch that you won't find anywhere else, and her love for her job shines through everything from the organic and vegan yogurt options to the table settings. The store is in pristine condition, and the yogurt tastes exceptional (and it's guilt free!!). The pricing is the same as other non-organic frozen yogurt shops, so there's no excuse not to go try out Piccadilly for yourself!"}
{"text":"When I arrived here with my daughter I was expecting to find organic yogurt of various flavors where you can add your choice of toppings. Well now I see that they have added to this by letting you choose one of three special flavors and pouring liquid nitrogen on it to make it a spectacular treat!  Everything including the flavors they use for liquid nitrogen has no preservatives so that it is not only good for you but healthy as well.  if you choose a flavored yogurt then you choose which size \"cup\" you want it in whether regular size or waffle size Also wanted to note that some of the yogurts are also vegan. You are then free to add as many topping as you wish in a self serve fashion. When you are finished they weigh your creation and you are charged accordingly. My daughter opted to go this route and she created a masterpiece with strawberry yogurt.  I on the other hand wanted to try the liquid nitrogen effect. Here you have a choice of 3 different offerings. There is a mint chocolate chip, a caramelized banana, and one made out of mocha if you want a coffee flavor. i choose the banana. You have a fixed price of either two scoops which would be a small or three which would be a large. I also saw on the sign they can do the same thing with some of their yogurts.  The counter lady explained how the process worked and I watched as she put a banana in a mixer, added the liquid nitrogen and then asked me if I wanted any toppings. I saw they had strawberries there so I asked them to add them into my creation. it came out beautiful and tasted as good as its looks. it wasn't heavy and had that full banana flavor to it with the strawberries mixed in.  Yes they have a rewards card where after 5 punches you get 50% off or if you go for 10 punches then you get a free item up to $5.00. They do not validate parking for the nearby garage.   They have tables where you can sit and enjoy along with water mixed with cucumbers and oranges if you get thirsty.  It is a great shop to try something a little different. Prices are like a salad bar. The more you take the more you pay. Located in the business district of Mt. Lebanon it is close to some of the other restaurants I recently visited in the area.  Am looking forward to coming back again soon."}
{"text":"What a refreshingly delicious experience at this self serve frozen yogurt place. After having tried quite a few different chains over the years as the trend of self serve fro-yo took off, they all were always so similar in style, taste, and options. But this place makes all organic yogurt with some organic toppings too! I tried the organic spiced pumpkin, apple cinnamon, and salted caramel and they were all delicious! The flavors were right on and tasted very fresh and real. What really put the experience over the top was the crock pot of warm, cut up cinnamon apples to put on as a topping. What a unique touch to the topping bar.   The inside is super cute and trendy. They even have board games in the back and tables to hang out at. The price is all done by weight, in typical self serve fro-yo fashion. It is a bit expensive, but it wouldn't stop be from going back to get some well made unique frozen yogurt!"}
