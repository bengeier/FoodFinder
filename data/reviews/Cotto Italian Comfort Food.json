{"text":"I really *really* enjoyed my dinner at Cotto tonight! Warm reception when you walk in and very attentive (but not overly so) wait staff. We had the calamari (divine) and the funghetto (so good!) to start. I had the Zuppa di Pesce and my brother had the spaghetti carbonara. Both of us enjoyed every single morsel. The flavors were rich and well developed and incredibly yummy. Everything tasted as though it had been made with love. The chef, Giuseppe, came out and greeted us during the meal to personally make sure we were happy customers. And we were! Very happy! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and will certainly be back sooner rather than later. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to see Cotto open up in Kensington. As residents of Sunnyside, we are very interested and loyal to our local restaurants.   We arrived at 730 on a busy Saturday night. Cotto has been open for a week now. So, they get some leeway. But...the proprietor is an experienced restauranteur, so some things don't get a pass.   Ambiance is nice, nothing special but welcoming, competant, warm. And, importantly, busy.   Menu is also nice, good choices, easy to read, not overwhelming.   Service is friendly but evolving. See below.   Wine list did not arrive with menus but this was quickly remedied. As for the by-the-glass selection, the Ripasso was nice but the two whites were average to below average (I did not have the Pinot Grigio but I had the other two). Not the best food wines.   We ordered the eggplant starter and a share plate of the Osso Bucco with three sides (zucchini chips, mushrooms, baked cauliflower).  Starter arrived promptly and was DELICIOUS. Osso Bucco arrived shortly thereafter. It was was ok. Not great but ok. And honestly, Osso Bucco needs to be and should be great. The issue is that it was not tender (it should have fallen off the bone), it was over sauced and the sauce was undeserving. The accompanying risotto was very well cooked (nice and al dente) but was frankly flavoured too richly to pair properly with Osso Bucco.   Up to this point, not a stellar experience but hey, open for a week, we are more than forgiving. \"Excuse me, do you know when our sides might be coming?\" Was our next question. Regretfully, they had not been ordered :-( Our server did not immediately own to this which we took to be an oversight but an annoying one.   We did finally get our sides but long after we had eaten our Osso Bucco. They were ok but, as they were designed as sides, they were meant to be eaten with not after our main meal. Zuchini chips were tasty but I have had as good or better in a bar. Mushrooms were tasty, a little peppery, and in a light cream sauce -- they would have been excellent *with* the Osso Bucco.   We arrived at the restaurant at 7:30. We received our sides at 8:50. We had theatre tickets for 9:30. We asked for our bill.   Unsurprisingly, given the total absence of remediation from ANYONE up to this date, our bill had no compensation for the clear and present errors in our experience. BTW, the total cost of the sides was $10. Comping these with an apology would have prevented this review. Alas, that is clearly not how Cotto rolls. To add insult to injury, we we charged for an extra item we did not order.   We did not penalize our server chocking the service errors up to inexperience. We do feel however that management not only took our patronage for granted but also disrespected us as customers.   Will we go back? Maybe. In a hurry? Not a chance.   The owner Thanked us for coming in the way out. He did not bother to ask how we liked it. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great meal and service at this new restaurant. Highly recommend to fans of Il Sogno and Borgo."}
{"text":"The moment you walk into this place, you get the feeling of a warm welcoming. The modern yet rustic decor and the alluring scents that waft from the kitchen are enough to make anyone want to sit down and make themselves at home.   The intricate details carries through the ambiance, service and most importantly - the food.  Cooking can be seen as an artform and I believe that Cotto has encapsulated this not only visually, but also in the texture, taste and smell of every dish that they create.  Everything we had was nothing less than amazing - the bruschetta (fresh ricotta, roasted tomato, basil pesto with balsamic reduction), alla luciana (traditional sauteed calamari), il norcino baked panini, carbonara spaghetti (the caramelized crust on the seared porchetta was UNREAL!), cinque terre style lingcod and crespelle (ricotta caramelized onion folded into crepes, drizzled in brown butter sage syrup)  Although full and quite content, we were easily swayed to indulge in dessert - lemon curd filled cannoli and vanilla bean panna cotta. Again, not disappointed at all.  Cotto markets themselves as Italian comfort food, and I would absolutely agree with that!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to Cotto, which occupies the space that used to be Pie Cloud. We were welcomed warmly and seated immediately. The restaurant is surprisingly spacious, despite the tiny frontage. Cool/rustic decor inside and a variety of table sizes to accommodate larger parties as well as couples.  Complimentary sparkling or still water and some nice breads with delicious flavoured butter were immediately brought to the table.  The menu is not extensive but some nice choices available, some traditional, some more innovative. We shared a prawn and bread salad appetizer. The butterflied prawns were excellent, with almost a roasted flavour. Combined nicely with a well dressed fris√©e and bread salad.   My spaghetti carbonara was very tasty, topped with a nice chunk of roasted porchetta. This wasn't a normal creamy, eggy carbonara like I would make at home but a rich,  bacon laced spaghetti with a good herbed sauce which was only slightly over salted.  My companion's saltimboca was very good. served with fingerling potatoes. Neighbours at the next table had meatballs, which looked really good. We finished with two types of sorbet - light, fresh and not overly sweet.  Service was prompt and the dishes were well presented - though I am not keen on meals served on a wooden board (as was the saltimboca), however fashionable that is.  Eating here was certainly enjoyable; good food, reasonably sized portions and pleasant service."}
{"text":"The food is excellent!   I had the papparadelle (sp?) and it was delicious.  We also started with the fritelle (basically cheese balls), and they surprisingly were soft, airy, and amazing.  Service was prompt and courteous to boot.   Prices are very  reasonable.   Might be my new favourite Italian place in the city!  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and am going back again Saturday with friends. The food is absolutely delicious and the service is impeccable. The wine menu prices are very reasonable. I love this place!"}
{"text":"OVER PRICED AND OVER RATED! Sorry folks but this place was a huge disappointment.  If you like being overcharged and underserved this place is the place to go to!  Food was average at best. Moxies is high end compared to this. Also Unfortunately it seems service in calgary has really gone down hill and this establishment is a prime example.  Might have been an oversight but clearly we  were overcharged on one entree.  We brought it up with a server twice. Than incredibly the server stopped coming to our table AFTER the bill was sent. Really? Just avoid us? Will never be back. Management has no control.  As we left the owner thanked us for coming in! Too funny . Clueless.  Also makes sense as we just found out, this \"chef/owner\" Giuseppe, spent most of his life waitering and most recently selling men's clothing at a department store! Haha"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because of the group that runs it and our positive experience with them in the past. Unfortunately for us, while priced reasonably, the food doesn't seem to have the same enjoyment we've experienced in the past.  I recommend checking them out, but do so without high expectations.  We likely won't make the effort to return. I hope your experience is better!"}
{"text":"Cotto provided outstanding pasta, everything made in the house, chef G really came back and provided yyc with great food. The only criticism I would've had was the portions are a little bit small, I left a little hungry and had to go to the cafe next door. We started with the arancini balls and then the pappardelle and carbonara, and finished with the tiramisu. Highly recommend the pappardelle it was amazing, and the tiramisu was really delicious as well. Thank you Cotto!"}
{"text":"The food was all suuuper yummy and our waiter was so professional, friendly and attentive. We would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I went there with my colleagues for dinner. I can't comment on my friends food. I had carbonara pasta. As a non-Canadian I was not over impressed with maple syrup pancetta but it's just my opinion. I would go back to try something else. The atmosphere is very nice, the service is friendly and professional. Prices are average. My pasta dish was $19. Beer 6-9$. I would recommend to do some small plate happy hours to bring people in."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time on Saturday. We ordered a calamari dish, gnocchi, carbonara and wine/beer. This was more than enough food for us.  My glass of chardonnay was very nice and only $7! SWEET!!! The complimentary rosemary bread was so good, I wanted to buy a loaf to take home. That crust... and the bread was soft and slightly sweet.   The calamari ringlets were so tender - just cooked perfectly. The sauce was zippy with a hint of spice. The two pastas were delicious. Value was outstanding. If you liked Borgo, you'll love this place. Service was lovely.   I'm already planning our next visit. The couple next to us were raving about the pork chops. I want to try the pork chops, bruschetta, caprese, and baked paninis at lunch."}
{"text":"I drive by the place almost daily, and was somewhat curious about it mainly as it replaced a really fun place, Pie Cloud.  After reading a few recent reviews from food bloggers, I decided to try it myself to see what the fuss was about.    The arancini lived up to the fuss- they were really amazing in taste and texture; I wish they were a bit bigger.  The calamari was really flavourful and a nice departure from the popular breaded style of calamari served everywhere.  With a friend, I shared the carbonara and a sandwich.  History- I have tried carbonara in almost every restaurant that serves it, and from several Italian cities as well; meaning I have tried carbonara in many, many ways.  The carbonara here is amazing and really satisfyingly flavourful- not too saucy, not too eggy (yes, I've had a carbonara that was almost an omelette), plenty of meat in notable sizes, spaghetti cooked al dente.  I'd recommend the carbonara here, hands down.    The pork sandwich was delicious and flavourful as well.  My personal taste prefers a toasted or a less bread-y \"carrier\" for a sandwich, so I would have preferred a ciabatta style bun versus the house made bun used here- but again, that's me and my personal aversion to bread.  Dessert was tiramisu and while light and tasty, not too sweet- could have been larger for the price point.  My lunch friends reported the lattes as really good, making me regret not getting one myself.    Complimentary sparkling or still water- no complaints with that from me!  Service was attentive and informative- our host was patient with our questions and made awesome recommendations.    There are about 5-6 (a lot!!) spots of free parking for Cotto in the back, from the alley.  Try here first before paying for street parking."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food, have tried about half the dishes from tasting friends meals, all were tasty and original.  The staff and service is also great.  The 5-6 special Tuesday to Thursday ($16 pasta with wine) is a sweet deal and the best for with children, super fast service , so you're in and out before the kids can flip out."}
{"text":"We have dined here twice for lunch. Both times the service was attentive but not smothering. The waiter was able to describe the specials and provided us with food allergy information. We had a celiac in our party and the restaurant was able to accommodate this dietary issue and provide many choices on the menu.  The first time we came here we enjoyed the specials. The restaurant filled up quickly. Despite being busy, the wait staff and kitchen were able to keep up. The meal was nicely timed. Two people had the seafood special and I had the eggplant dish. All were delicious and prepared properly. The portion sizes were just right!  The second dining experience did not disappoint. This time we ordered the meatball entree and the steak/potato entree. Both did not disappoint. The meatball, when it arrived, seemed like an odd presentation with the bread but it actually worked. It was a nice blend of flavours and quickly disappeared!  We will return!  Celiac-friendly."}
{"text":"A little bit of a disappointment for sure.  Restaurant is well appointed, interesting and rustic. There are two rooms. We were seated in the back room. Cozy but so loud with other groups we found ourselves almost shouting. Ask not to sit here.   The real let down here was the service. After taking our drink order, we didn't see much of our server. It took a long time to bring a bottle of wine and a.beer. My partner was out of beer and no refill was offered.  The real problem started with the food. We ordered three appetizers, i'm sure the order was never placed. It took so long, and again our server was not  around to ask. Eventually, they came to the table, apologized and said the appetizers would be out shortly and they were. They were tasty,    By this point we knew we might be in for a wait with our dinner, and that is what happened.  After a very long time it arrived. Two of the four dishes were incorrect. They took them back and two of us ate. They brought the new dishes as quickly as they could.  The server said they misunderstood the order, maybe?  Other tables were looked after with much more attention.  The food, when it arrived was tasty. Just a long long wait to get it and to get our drinks.  We left disappointed and felt it wasn't much of a night out."}
{"text":"I've never eaten authentic Italian food and coming here is an experience like no other.  We ordered for a family of 5 and spent about $130 including dessert.   Every SINGLE bite was absolutely divine. Everything is made in house from the focasia bread to their ice cream. Honestly, if I could've I would've ordered a second round.  The portions look a bit small eg Spaghetti and Lobster Gnocchi, but it's actually way more filling than it looks especially if you share food.   The waiters are great, they know their stuff and the place is gorgeous too! One tip, if you're a typical Canadian or American or just not from Europe, they don't take away the plates until everyone is done.   Highly recommend if you ever pass by Calgary!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food and room.  Such a pleasure to see a small and locally owned and run restaurant.  The food was amazing, beautifully presented with even more beautiful flavours.   Everything was simple yet elegant.  The chef walked the room and checked on tables, such old school yet classy touch. I would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I want to like Cotto. Nice atmosphere, good service, friendly staff.   We started with the arancini which were nicely done. My wife had the Milanese, which seemed pretty good to me based on my few bites. The polenta fries were a nice touch, very creative. I was not a fan of the Salcicce. The sausages were just too greasy and I wasn't fond of the flavour. Plated with good vegetables, I will say.   Bottom line, I would like to visit once more."}
