{"text":"Had the prime rib dinner for New Year's Eve and my wife the Ribeye. We had the crab cake and potato skins apps and house & Caesar salad.  All good. Steak and prime rib was exceptional...I wish they would offer prime rib on a more regular basis. Baked potato with bacon bits and a killer ice cream and warm fudge brownie dessert...yum. Service was very attentive. Desert Dave's Delivers!"}
{"text":"We are new in town so making our rounds.  We came here for lunch.  Very nice looking place, clean and quiet.  I ordered the Chili, and we split a club sandwich.  Chili was good, I like Wendy's better.  Fries are big, meaty, and hot.  Club sandwich... was about as bland as could be except the overpowering American cheese.  We took most of the cheese off, but the meat was almost flavorless.  It was very interesting, I don't think I've ever run into such a predicament.  I'm just not sure if we'll get there for dinner anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and small portions. When we went the bartender had his girlfriend there and paid attention to her only"}
{"text":"Entries are about $30.  I ordered a manhattan which was weak and was the start of a disappointing evening.  The steak was ordered medium rare and was medium.  Vegetables were over cooked.  Interior of the restaurant was nicely done and not crowded.  Overall to much money for the experience.  Three stars is a bit generous."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times over the last two months, twice for breakfast and just today for dinner.  The ambiance is very nice, comfortable and relaxed.  Each time the service has been excellent.  The french toast was great, and the eggs were cooked to order as specified (basted) and properly seasoned.  Tonight I had the ribeye, one of my favorite cuts, fat and all.  The meat was a good cut, very tender, well seasoned and cooked as ordered (medium rare on the rare side).  The garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and creamy and chunky at the same time.  The green beans were cooked properly (not too crunchy, not too soft) cooked in butter and server with crumbled bacon).  The service was very good and we chatted with the owner for a few minutes after dinner.  Too full for dessert we had coffee, which was fresh (nothing worse than \"cooked\" coffee).  we don't usually drink alcohol, we had soft drinks.  All in dinner was under $70 for two, which isn't cheap, but a good steak isn't normally cheap.    We will be going back."}
{"text":"Tried one more time. Hardly any staff on duty on a. Saturday evening. Our order came out wrong and one of us were finished eating by the time the correct order came. It took them over an hour to bring our food at the onset. Then, had to wait for the second order.Salmon was good, but the filet was sub-par. Beer way overpriced. All in all, an unpleasant experience. Sorry to say, we cannot return. In all fairness to them, they did comp the steak. We had a coupon for $30, but that still put us in the negative because the salmon was $18. As long time Fountain Hills residents, we had high hopes for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for a less than average meal. I ordered the steak special, at $20. it was very disappointing.   Decor, service, noise level were all good but the meal killed it for me. I was not impressed, we won't be back .."}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant in town for breakfast. It was terrible. My eggs were so well done they were dry and rubbery. I also tried the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was okay, but the biscuits were like Pillsbury grandes  and had one side thrown on the griddle to toast it. It was unusual to say the least. The rest of the biscuit was too soft still for biscuits and gravy. Just not impressed with their breakfast."}
{"text":"Bar review only. I will be heading back to try to the food soon. Bartender was excellent making sure to acknowledge us and then get our drink. He kept a good eye on making sure are drinks were good to go and cleaned up the counter.   I will also say the people in the bar were very kind and talkative. Nice place to hang out and have a drink. Drink prices were about average for the area."}
{"text":"Really nice place with really good steaks.  We had the NY strip and the steaks were outstanding.  Dinner came with a salad and nice side.  The trio that was singing made it a great environment.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love a good steak house. Therefore I was really happy when this place took over Fontinis on LA Montana.   I stopped in for an early dinner the first week they opened and I was the only person there. This was 4:30 on a weekday afternoon.   The atmosphere was nice,  but when I got the menu I nearly fell off my chair.   I ordered a New York Strip steak, one of my favorites. It was $59. I figured for that price it had better be the best steak I'd ever had. It wasn't. It was pretty good, but not as tender as I would expect for medium rare. The veggies I had with it were also OK.   The service was pretty bad. I was the only one there and there were servers standing around and talking but it took about 10 minutes for someone to  bring me a glass of water and take my order. Also, they didn't know the menu and had to go back into the kitchen at least twice to answer my questions.   From the looks of most of these reviews, the service has improved, and that's a good thing. But if $59 for an average steak isn't too much money, we're sending these guys the wrong message."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Interior decor is nice, big bar, friendly staff, ok entertainment.  Owner seems likes a very nice guy as well.  The food, however, is just average - it didn't wow me.  I was happy to see another restaurant open in the space after the demise of Fountini's.  I hope they survive, but in order to do so, the chef is going to have to step it up a bit.  I'm rooting for them!"}
{"text":"Food: Good Service: Great Price:Good Ambience: Great"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices menu and cocktail prices.  The staff was fantastic and the bartender made you feel welcome.   The locals enjoyed karaoke there on Thursday nights and there was other great entertainment as well.   Unfortunately, read today, the establishment is closed.   My favorite happy hour food item was the coconut scrimp.  Other favorites included the sliders...  So long desert daves. We'll miss you.   Fountain hills loses yet another restaurant.   For those thinking about investing in a restaurant business in fountain hills, look elsewhere. The property owners will bleed you dry. They'd rather the spaces were empty as a rent paying tenants don't help their tax shelter status."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice atmosphere.  Love having this in Fountain Hills.  We had a group there Friday night and it was great.  The steak, coconut shrimp and Alfredo were out of this world.  Extremely friendly and Tommy Holloway singing was a huge bonus.  Loved it and going back for New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"The highlight of the evening was that it was easy to get a table  The shrimp chowder was very good.   Beyond that the steaks were very poor for that price point.  Think Old Towne Buffet steaks.   Poor quality meat and flavorless.   Baked potatoes were unremarkable and mashed potatoes were cold.     Our server was a very nice young man when we could find him.   Which is unexplainable because there were only a few tables occupied and another server was present.     The music was loud and mournful, like we were at a funeral.     At that price point, well any price point , you should get a decent meal.  In Fountain Hills, won't be long before they have to close unless something dramatically changes."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend Sunday breakfast here. Only one waitress and it took a long time to get our eggs.  Actually, the potatoes were tasty and the bacon and sausage was good, but I made a big point of liking my scrambled eggs NOT DRY but they came as dry as they could get without being brown. Too bad as the place is cute."}
{"text":"we tried this place and it was ok. My girlfriend enjoyed the ny steak. I ordered the porterhouse. it was very dry and unseasoned. For a 30 dollar steak I wasn't impressed. our waitress was very nice but not fully trained. I'm willing to give it one more try because I live in town and was really excited to have a steak house in town.. hopefully they work out the kinks. ."}
{"text":"I loved the Coconut shrimp and the stuffed mushrooms. Desert Daves has a lot of character and live music."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on my birthday because I was craving a steak Sandwich and the sign boasted a \"steakhouse\".  Unfortunately, the server informed me that steaks are only available at dinner.   When my husband mentioned it was my birthday and I had my heart set on a steak sandwich she told us that the person who cooks steaks did not come in until later.    Bizarre.    So even though I really wanted a steak,I chose the French dip.   Normally a French dip ranks up in my faves close to a ribeye steak sandwich.    This was the worst French dip I had ever had.  The bread was not able to hold up to the meat and juice so it basically dissolved in to a soggy mess.  The au jus had so much Rosemary in it that it was inedible.  I promise that I am not criticizing the French dip because it was not what I originally wanted. I usually love a French dip.   The high points were the fries and our server.  Not necessarily in that order.  I work in the service industry so usually if I am not working we stay home.  It is rare that we go out to eat and we definitely would not go here again."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant!! Great service fair prices perfect entertainment too. I had the halibut and hubby the rib eye. No complaints there. I would send people here with no regrets."}
{"text":"The food has been sketchy ...sometimes good sometimes so-so. But definitely way overpriced. I'm not sure how they're going to make it in fountain Hills charging what they do. I'm willing to pay a lot for an extraordinary meal but not an average quality one meal. The first time we went the filet was pretty good but the second two times were not great."}
{"text":"We are so excited to finally get a GREAT steak place in town!! With hormone free, antibiotic free meat. So yummy and great atmosphere. Thanks for opening in small town Fountain Hills - we will be eating here a lot! Yum! Jill H."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice and both times the food and service has been fantastic. We both love it and drive an hour to get there.  Tommy, their entertainment is awesome."}
{"text":"What a great place.  We had the Chicken Cordon Bleu. It was terrific.  Very attentive staff and some nice easy listening live music.  We even had the bartenders wanting to help us channel surf to get the best background tv  I would highly recommend this place.  Food is great sensibly priced great service  What's not to like"}
{"text":"Update - stopped by again bringing a friend. I had the bacon wrapped filet, cooked exactly as requested and very tender and tasty. Garlic mash was made on the chunky side with skin on, yummy. My partner said her steak was good also. Instead of the trio, tonight they had a solo singer (Tommy Holloway).  Nice mellow music perfect for dinner.  Entrees are a bit on the expensive side but Fountain Hills is a tough market with 1/3 of the clientele leaving town 6 months out of the year. As long as the quality and experience is maintained, we'll be back.  Another nice meal."}
{"text":"Ok restaurant. Neither food or service are outstanding but good enough overall. Prices are higher than most in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"This place is OK but I feel bad as I don't think it will make it through the summer unless they do a good lunch business,  It was a rainy night but when we arrived (Saturday) the place was empty Of course AZ people are intimidated by stuff falling out of the sky and will stay home rather than get wet.  As they are bad enough drivers on dry sunny days, that is probably for the best.  But I regress..  The wait staff was nice but not terribly competent.  The food was OK but not really anything special.  I really would like to see more places make it in Fountain Hills, and I wish I could say it was stellar and tell everyone to go, but it just isn't.  It is pleasantly decorated, nice large bar, but only passable food.  My salmon was so dull you could have fed it to a 2 year old, and hsb steak was OK but not Flemings quality for sure.I wish them well and hope they do OK, but as cheap as most of the seniors are here, I am not terribly optimistic."}
{"text":"One word...terrible! We were a party of 4. Arrived at 5:30. Only 1 other table had people, party of 2. Ordered nachos, stuffed mushrooms and fish and chips for appetizers. Waitress asked if we wanted chili nachos or chicken. We chose chicken. When they came out 15 minutes later it was just chips, hard solidified cheese and pre-cooked but cold chicken chucks. That's it. We sent it back as it was cold and the cheese had already solidified. The stuffed mushrooms and fish were good. The fries were way overly salted you couldn't even eat them. When these 2 appetizers came out another 5 minutes later the waitress did apologize for the nachos but her excuse was that she didn't know they no longer served chicken on top of the nachos. Umm..not sure what that had to do with it being cold and solidified but whatever.   Our meals were no better.   1 ordered sausage stuffed pork chops. No sausage in stuffing. More of a traditional bread stuffing. And it was cold and dry. Ordered garlic mashed potatoes as side and these were cold. Like they just took them out of the fridge and plated them.   1 ordered filet mignon. Not bad but not worth the price.   1 ordered t-bone with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. T-bone was just ok. Certainly not steakhouse worthy. I've grilled better. The garlic mashed potatoes were the same as the other. Cold like they came out of the fridge and plated.   1 ordered grilled chicken. The chicken was so pounded  and over cooked it was inedible. Took one bite and that was it. Had tasted like and felt like shoe leather. Ick!  When we told waitress about garlic mashed potatoes she asked us if we wanted her to, and I quote, \"nuke them\". Umm....if that's what you think will fix this, ick, no thank you. She never even asked about why friend never ate her chicken. Said she'd take off $5 for the mashed potatoes.   When bill arrived, yes, it did have the $5 taken off but she never took off for the nachos that we sent back and didn't want replaced. Once this was pointed out she did apologize and took off for the nachos as well.   Seeing that only a couple other people came in to eat this whole time we were there not sure why there was such an issue. It's not like they were busy. Plus, by the time we got out of there it was 2 hours later!   Not a good meal, not great service.  Seems like they don't really know what they are doing.   Will definitely not go back. Still felt we got ripped off even remembering this. This meal, if you call it that, was over $100 bucks! And we didn't order any drinks! Not good."}
{"text":"At first I thought it was going to  be a good experience.   It turned out unpleasant.  Nothing makes me more irritable than a cook who filets the steak and over cooks.  I ordered medium rare and got medium well almost well done and my steak was cut in slices.  The staff were no where to be found I had to physically go find someone to let them know.  After that very apologetic.  Waiter forgot our salad that you  pay extra for.  They comped one of my beverages, took $2 off other one.   We ended up with 2 free desserts ( I don't eat sweets but I took one) They tried but our dining experience was ruined not eating our meals together.  The second steak came out medium rare and non cut per my request.  Meal came with veggies which consisted of one broccoli floret, one chunk of carrot and literally two slices of zucchini which were not even hardly cooked.  Almost raw.  I get frustrated because I'm paying good money for a meal, if you are in business get it right.  Don't serve it if its not right.  I used to have a screening t-shirt business.  If something wasn't right I didnt  try and pass off mistakes to my customers.  Oh and did I mention, this was our first visit to the area and this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took a date here two weeks ago and had a great time! Nice decor, seated right away & our waiter was very friendly. We both ordered the Rib eye. She got the salad with red potatoes (looked great, nice portions) & I ordered the soup (Shrimp something.. Good!) & garlic mashed potatoes. They were great! The steaks were medium-rare. Very tasty & tender. Cooked to perfection. All in all a very nice steak dinner for $26.00. Oh yeah... the bread. Warm, soft rolls! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried them for happy hour last night.  Attempted to order one of the \" special drinks\" they describe on their own website-- their version of a Harvey Wallbanger.  The bartender had no idea what I was talking about.  I described the ingredients, and he said he would make it if he could find the ingredients.  He could not.  After being open this long, they should have their act together. I wish them good luck, as Fountain Hills is a great market, but has more experienced and sophistated customers."}
{"text":"I will not return here. Food is questionable.  Service is very slow. This was much better when they started. Too bad."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  Nice decor.  Nice entertainment. The food is okay but the steak is not super.  We are a little prejudiced as we come from Alberta beef country & it is pretty hard to beat Alberta beef. The steak was okay but not great.  I hope that it makes out though because Fountain Hills can use the different restaurant.  Will try it again."}
