{"text":"The only thing I've ever ordered from here was the wings and they were so good. Crispy and tons of sauces to choose from. This is our new go to for wings!"}
{"text":"Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!"}
{"text":"Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and fresh cut fries.  Also the bartender was a delight and the service was excellent.  Very sociable and cool neighborhood bar that I will return to when staying in the area"}
{"text":"Great bar! Food is always consistent and good. Staff is amazing and friendly. Nice, neighborhood bar atmosphere. Come in and ask for Timmy!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and glad we did. Great beer selection, the sandwiches are wonderful and huge, wings were very good. Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great, the owner, waitstaff and kitchen staff.  If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again, we will go back!"}
{"text":"Was in town for business, saw the good reviews on yelp for this place, and they were accurate. I had Tom's wedge and it was delicious and huge. They also have a nice selection of craft beers"}
{"text":"9/6/2013  Dinner today - at a bar and grill,  a very busy place filled with locals and families.  The service is quick and friendly; the food good.  It was a bit on the noisy side, but the good kind of noisy.  Of course the TV's were all on the sports channel, which no one was really watching at the time.  A good place that gets 4 stars mostly because of the atmosphere and because we liked it.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is the inside that counts."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great food, excellent beer selection!  Bartenders are great! It is a great hometown neighborhood bar with good people and friendly staff.  The food is a good selection of var type food with large sandwiches.  Excellent wings!"}
{"text":"We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the Yelp reviews. I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today.   We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent.   All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.  I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)"}
{"text":"Perfect joint! Don't be afraid as you pull up... It's a nice little neighborhood. Was in town on biz and my hotel was right up the street. Great service, well apportioned servings and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in!"}
{"text":"I've have had better AT ALEXION'S!   Early last night (Friday) Reubens came cold, meat dry and a funny color.  We waited a long time and the place wasn't that busy.  Wife's sandwich was cold, like her fries.  I don't think our guests will go there again.  The two Reubens were taken back, replaced it with a very excellent small pizza.    Notes:  I've been going since 1987, mostly lunches.  I don't recall being disappointed with any sandwich or sides before.  I was expecting to discover a change in ownership or management.  I'll give Alexion's another shot.  I'm not in any hurry."}
{"text":"What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..  A cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.    Cheers ! !"}
{"text":"I have visited twice around dinner time. Both times I feel like they were significantly under-staffed. The service was slow and the wait staff expressed how busy they were (meanwhile I personally thought it was a typical dinner crowd). I was happy with their food, beer selection and prices."}
{"text":"This is a great little pub that is located in a residential neighborhood.  That just doesn't happen in NC so we were pretty intrigued by the location.  We arrived on a Tuesday evening at around 6:30.  We sat in a booth as soon as we arrived.  Our server arrived right away with menus.  She was super helpful with beer selection.  She brought us several samples so we could make a tasty choice.  For dinner , I knew that I wanted the steak salad with fries (you can't get fries in your salad in NC).  My husband had the nights special which was a steak sandwich and fries.  The food was good and the service was great.  If you are in the Greentree area be sure and stop by.  It's a great little pub."}
{"text":"I go here to get away and enjoy a nice drink and great company. The service is always top notch and customer service is awesome. First class management and food."}
{"text":"This place, by far, has the BIGGEST sandwiches. I'm a hog, and I have to order a \"half,\" which is the size of a full size sandwich elsewhere, especially the cold cut and the braunsweiger, my personal favorites. Wing night Tuesday and Thursday, oh yea. Lots of craft beers on tap. My old man orders the bar pie pizza (white) and he loves it. Go here. Just do it."}
{"text":"Great prices for good drinks & food! I'm not a fan of dark, crowded, noisy bars. Go there with friends because the place has a lovely patio area (covered porch) and we can sit & drink &  eat & chat &  actually hear each other. We usually share a pitcher  or 2 but  Alexion's does offer a very, very good selection of craft  & other bottled beers.   Food: always tastes fresh & is well prepared. Pizza good, their wings are generally unusually large (very good garlic parm!) &  all the other offerings always good.  Sandwiches & salads- large & tasty especially for the price! Another  big plus is easy, ample, off street parking.                      **Best is the excellent service! A super friendly &  good staff!** Honestly, is just a good local bar. It is not family oriented. It's a bar for adults...leave the kids with a sitter!   It's  just a very good local joint, very Pittsburgh in spirit & service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat food was great portion size is awesome great beer selections. Server was great a must stop if in greentree pa"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. We came here for a late lunch starving. Left here so full and satisfied! I ordered the deluxe chicken salad with breaded chicken and ranch. The breaded chicken was so crispy and flavorful. The table ordered the garlic Parmesan wings and they had chunks of garlic on them! My fianc√© had the tom's wedgie which he loved. I had a bite and can say it was generously made. Their sandwiches are huge and under $10. I definitely can't wait to come back to try more."}
{"text":"I've lived close to Alexion's for over a year and took me that long to give it a shot. Amazing bar food-huge sandwiches and cold beer. Awesome spot and cool-Pittsburghy decor!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The bartenders & food are awesome! The manager Timmy is such a great guy and will make sure you're taken care of! I cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"great little bar on the off beatin path in greentree, pa.....stopped in here wed. nite for a quick one and what a gem in the rough !!.... i met malarie the bartender and she made me feel right a home......( sorry mal if I spelt your name wrong...) the bar was packed for a wed. nite and everyone was friendly  ....didn't get a chance to eat here but the food looked great.....next time...the menu had a nice choice and prices were great !  the bar was clean along with the restrooms"}
{"text":"Burger was amazing...chips were meh. We went into this place starving after a long day of traveling and it was exactly what we needed. Divey and fun!"}
{"text":"I went to Alexions with a co-worker/friend for lunch during lent.  First impression, it was small and packed.  This is apparently a very popular lunch stop.  They have a nice outdoor seating section, but it was closed due to the weather.    I opted for their Friday special a fish sandwich with cheese, hold the cheese.  I hate cheese on fish, in my mind it doesn't go well together.  It came with one side and chips.  I opted for cole slaw because that does go great with fish.  The chips were straight out of a bag.  I am not a chip fan, especially not one that Lay's delivered.  It would have been nice to have homemade chips.  The special was 10.50, so I was hoping it would be good.  The wait wasn't terrible for as busy as they were, but if you're on a strict time schedule for lunch I'd call ahead.  The food arrived in about 20 minutes.  My fish sandwich though nice size was a little small for the price, compared to other's that are cheaper.  The slaw was nice, good flavor but the fish was average.  I loaded it up with some tarter and cocktail sauce to help the flavor out.  It wasn't a bad sandwich just a tad small and mediocre for the price.  I would stop back to try something else another time and would love to grab a beer here, as they had a really decent selection, and the servers were also pleasant."}
{"text":"I usually love your food but today I had a delicious Italian delight but my 3 dozen wings to go were SO over cooked.  If I was there I would have sent them back for all the money I spent. What a disappointment"}
{"text":"Good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice.   Doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol.   Their wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches.  Offers a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar, excellent staff, very friendly, very attentive to the needs of their guests. They've got a great happy hour and run daily specials on food all the time. I consider the pepperoni roll here to be the best in Pittsburgh! I'm a big fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich too, very simple, but yummy. Another great thing about this bar is for most drinks you aren't paying Pittsburgh prices. Things are very reasonable as far as drinks go. I'm not a fan of beer, but if you are. They have 20 beers on tap including ipa's, ales, Stouts/porters & as well as others. UPDATE: They feature a happy hour Monday through Friday from 5 to 7 and even on Saturday from 8 till 10! Plus daily food specials. Just a heads up the kitchen is now open 7 days a week usually opening at 11 a.m. they close at 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, midnight Friday and Saturday, and 11 p.m. on Sunday. If you're looking for a great place to stop and there's tons of hotels around here, within walking distance or cheap Uber distance, this is a great place to go!   Enjoy  Dig"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, great beer selection, and relaxing atmosphere. Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after years of wanting to go. Neighborhood bar with decent craft beer selection and really good 'bar food' that's reasonably priced. Bartenders and servers are very friendly and helpful. Every Pgh neighborhood has one, you need to find them and go, - often! In Crafton/ Carnegie it's Alexions!"}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to eat close by since we were staying in the Pittsburgh area.  Alexion's was on the list of places to eat given to us by the hotel.  We decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside.  We were shown to a table right beside the bar, where there were a few patrons were enjoying their drinks, albeit a little too much.  Had the pizza, wings, and cheese steak with mushrooms.  The food was really good, all but the canned mushrooms on the cheese steak.  Would have preferred fresh mushrooms, but the fresh italian roll made up for it.  More than willing to try Alexion's again."}
{"text":"This place has a real neighborhood vibe to it, and offers a nice selection of brews along with a decent menu if you're here for a meal. Comfortable decor, decent service and reasonable prices make this a good spot for a sojourn if in the area. The bartender was cool in offering samples of drafts before I selected, and the food (I had wings and zucchini planks - both excellent) was very good."}
{"text":"Alexion is my new favorite local spot. Everything that my Girlfriend and I have ordered so far was Amazing! The wedges, calzones, burgers, wings, and Reuben have all been fantastic! One of the best beer selections in the area and a friendly, fun loving staff. Seems like every time we go out anymore Alexion is at the top of our list. We enjoy Blinky's, Hop House, Vincent's, and Manny's, but all are taking a backseat for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks which never came so we left.  And never even had our order taken for food while waiting.  I understand being busy but not even coming by to explain or manage expectations is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The BEST local hangout.  Super friendly atmosphere with great tap selection and awesome bar food.    My favorites are the Tom Turkey sandwich, Turkey salad and the fish. Although I have rarely been disappointed with the food.    A must to check out!  Great Pittsburgh neighborhood bar!!"}
{"text":"Fun dive bar with great food. If you are in the area and don't want to put up with a smoky bar, this is the place."}
{"text":"It's a nice family bar with a hometown feel to it.  They are good people there.  Great food and service.  I don't go often,  but owe an apology and a tip."}
{"text":"Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant!! It doesn't look like much from the outside but the service and food were fantastic. TVs playing with football games and a great atmosphere inside. Our server was so helpful and friendly. The menu was extensive and the portions were huge, especially for the price. The calzone was so delicious and the burgers were great also. If you are staying in Pittsburg I would definitely recommend this bar for a meal. Booths, lots of parking and free WiFi are available too"}
{"text":"Stopped in here as it was close to my hotel.  Great local pub. Service was great, food was definitely above average. Would recommend the wings for sure. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings.   You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch and the pretty solid beer selection. Food was a few notches above bar food and the service was great. We recommend and will stop again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place.   The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.  We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!  My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by Alexions! I don't want to define it as a dive bar because that wouldn't fit, it's simply a neighborhood bar/restaurant that hasn't had a hipster remodel.  And it doesn't need one!  Great food--flavorful, fresh, and at affordable prices.  I came here on a Wednesday when it was $1 off craft beers and personal \"bar\" pizzas (could easily feed two) were $4.75, both great deals.  All in all I was able to drink and eat for around $20, you can't beat it.  Also, fast and attentive service.  Parking is a breeze with two gravel lots on each side of the building.  Without a doubt will return again.   Side note, the bar is non smoking but smokers will are able to smoke on the patio."}
{"text":"I ate here a few years ago and wasn't really impressed. Yesterday a couple friends invited my wife and I here for drinks and a bite to eat. I had the Reuben and I loved it. The meat was perfect and the bread while not grilled with butter like a typical Reuben was delicious. The bread was soft and fresh and the dressing came on the side so it was nice to just pick it up and eat it without having greasy hands. Everyone else got burgers and they looked really good. I'll definately try one next time but it will be hard not to get that Reuben again. Overall typical bar food menu, service was ok ( didn't get water and had to ask for silverware ). Will definately be back soon though"}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich and great local bar. We frequent it after each local game that we coach. Great staff and great food/beer selection"}
{"text":"Nice patio area. Really good food -- and very large portions. We got wings, a reuben, and a huge salad.  Great selection of beers too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd. It's kind of lost in the crowd. Pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed. It's a great neighborhood bar. And I would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place.  It's just good enough"}
{"text":"I never would have found this place if it weren't for Yelp, and I'm so glad I did! After seeing everyone's picture of the wedgie's I HAD to get one.  Luckily my boyfriend and I split one, cause they are HUGE! I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I ordered it, but this thing is like a giant sandwich, but the bread is PIZZA CRUST! I was so pleasantly surprised when I figured that out! We tried the steak wedgie and it was soooo good! It also happened to be wing night which is Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Wings are 40 cents...super cheap and super yummy!   This place is definitely a sporty, divey, casual place to come for a drink or bite to eat, but I think that's part of its charm.  The staff was very friendly but I did have a bit of trouble getting prompt service which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars, but hey, it could have just been an off night, and the food was worth the wait! Definitely give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I had the toms wedge because I saw the picture here on yelp.  Lived up to my expectations and far exceeded them. Why does not more places make a pizza wedge sandwich!!!!!  Made my day! Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot! Ruben was amazing. Great craft beer on tap. Super friendly staff Nothing bad to say at all!"}
{"text":"Friendly local bar with great service and good food,  won't be disappointed if you like bar food at a reasonable price.  Good place to go for \"Friday fish sandwich \""}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The food was excellent. Service was great and we really enjoyed our dinner. Great beer choices as well."}
{"text":"Ten outta ten. Amazing food. Chickens wings be off the hook. If you want food... come here cuz they got it. Pizza boy beer is the new favorite IPA."}
{"text":"Food is FANTASTIC! Service is always fast too. Great little bar/grill to grab a sandwich for lunch or wings for dinner. Doesn't look like much, but whoever is cooking back there knows what they're doing. I've gone several times and it's always delicious. Burgers, deli sandwiches on soft Italian bread, salads, big portions at a great price. Idk what else to say, go here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting."}
{"text":"I will be back. Drank and dined here Saturday afternoon, March 2nd, while staying at a nearby hotel for a chess tournament. Went to this place on a tip from a friend and was not disappointed. We had wings, a cheeseburger, and fries. Everything was perfect (except for the celery that came with the wings - not sure what was going on there).   The decor is classic Pittsburgh, but the bathrooms were small (unless there were more located in the back room that I did not see). I think it would be a nice place to watch the game. I would like to go back when they are busy to see if it is as cool as I think it would be, and I probably will soon."}
{"text":"I am in town on business, by far best meal of the entire trip. Had a custom turkey sandwich.. best of my life!"}
{"text":"This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!   It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game.   They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.  Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.  The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had."}
{"text":"They lost me when the bartender sat our party pizza down in front of us. Essentially, it's a small pizza dough stretched to fit the large pizza pan and up charged. We ordered the white \"party pizza\" and was unpleasantly surprised at the overly buttery, paper thin crust. I told the bartender about my dismay and she said that all of their pizza's are thin. I believed her,  that is until the man further down the bar ordered a small pizza and it was easily three times as fluffy as our sad, paper thin pizza.   The bar itself is okay but if your looking for a place to watch anything on the TV I wouldn't recommend this place. The TV's are awfully small. The bartender was nice, but after she lied about the pizza situation and chose to use OVER THE TOP obscene language I was over the place.   Not for me, but try for yourself."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, good atmosphere, and the food was good too. I had the barbecue wings and some Guinness Stout on draft. Unfortunately, they didn't have anything for dessert."}
{"text":"We were in Greentree so decided to give this place a try based on good YELP reviews.... well one things was right...beer is ICE Cold in frosted mugs.   Food was also awesome... started off with mozzarella sticks, an Italian wedgie, toms wedgie and a build your own sandwich...... every thing we ordered was so good!  Happy to find a new place to add to our list... we will definitely be back.  Oh and service was excellent... which is a deal breaker for me!"}
