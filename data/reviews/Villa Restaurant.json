{"text":"I was here for brunch with girlfriends in September and had an overall good experience.   I don't think this spot is known for brunch necessarily but it is a big space and was able to accommodate a larger group as well as my girlfriend's stroller. We were there to meet her new baby girl!  Most of us went with the omelette of the day which had chicken, roasted veggies and cheddar cheese. I excluded the chicken because I find chicken with eggs a difficult concept to overcome. The omelette was really delicious, we all cleaned our plates. Rye toast on the side and a small green salad were just enough to finish the meal.   Service was on point, refilling tea and coffee promptly. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Poor service, understaffed for a Saturday night. The pasta was overcooked, and the chicken was standard banquet hall fare. There is a reason this place is offering Groupon discounts."}
{"text":"Nice spot with delicious comfort food.  Some servers could review the definition of personal space, but other than that a good spot with a classy/casual vibe to dine with friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor is gorgeous. The service is very good as well. The food is average. Some dishes were pretty good, some not so much. We were served rock hard bread, could break your fingers trying to rip it apart. Tomato sauce was alright, not sufficient enough for an Italian restaurant for sure. Prices were pretty high for the quality. Would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but not 4."}
{"text":"Until recently this has been a favourite go-to restaurant. The menu is nice, table spacing comfortable, and quality of food and service was usually good. And I have really enjoyed the outdoor seating during summer months. When dining at the restaurant, my experience has been that the staff take care to make things right. At  a recent visit, crab cakes came charred on the outside and cold on the inside, and staff were suitably apologetic and quick to replace them with appetizers that were perfectly done. Osso Buco has been a reliable favourite. And other dishes are usually delicious and well presented.  The last 2 experiences with Villa have failed, however. Both were attempts to order for delivery. In the first case, the osso buco was as good as ever, but the beef and mushroom risotto (usually delicious) was so overloaded with garlic as to be inedible. Feedback given to the automated \"How did we do?\" email let them know of the problem. As I was shopping on Bloor St. the next day and had not yet received a response to my feedback, I stopped in to check that they had received my note. The owner said she had, and intended to send me a voucher that day for a replacement meal. After more than a week, I emailed her to remind her to send it. She did. I'm all for giving second chances. I am not an \"aggressive consumer\". In fact, those who know me say I am patient to a fault. Tonight I sent another online order for delivery. The order went in at around 5:30. Their system confirmed the order and indicated it should be delivered around 6:15. Around 6:50 I called to check the status of the order. No one answered the phone (after more than 20 rings). So I emailed with the same enquiry. The owner called to say they were not doing delivery orders tonight as they are closed for a private function.  WTF?!!! So the chit went in 1 1/2 hours ago and they couldn't let me know then? Patience has run out. So I will use the voucher at a dine in meal (so I can make sure I get the quality I expect)  and will never order delivery from Villa again. Maybe I'll go back again next summer for a lunch on the patio. I'll let you know if they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"My partner and I live very close to Bloor West village and this little gem was a great find last evening.  Although the service started off a little slow, the rest of the night was incredible, from the service to the food.  Highly recommend the Kale salad, really great and so tasty.  We had the Salmon and the Striploin, delish!  We will definitely be back - so nice to have a great place to go so close to home without having to be right downtown!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Chicago and I checked out Bloor street this afternoon in search of a pleasant looking restaurant with sidewalk dining.  It was time for lunch.  I paid $15.00 for the smallest salad I have ever seen.  It was the size of, at best, a side salad.  I finished it within 3 minutes.  After tax and tip, I paid $20.00.  Needless to say, I was expecting a hearty lunch size salad for that price and was absolutely shocked!  Don't go to Villa Restaurant if you are hungry, but if you do, bring lots of cash."}
{"text":"When we lived near Bloor West Village this was our favorite restaurant within walking distance.  That said, it is not spectacular.  This is the place to go if you want to go to a nice place for dinner after a walk in High Park.    The atmosphere at Villa is upscale and inviting.  The tables are better spaced than at a lot of restaurants where I feel like I hear more of the neighboring table's conversation than my own.  Villa also has a nice wine list, the bottles at the low end of the price range are about $40.  They always seem to have a vegetarian stuffed pasta and it has never disappointed.  Their desserts look great on paper but are usually unremarkable.  The service at Villa can be hit or miss.  We have had very good service here (usually on weekends) but have also had terrible service with long waits to order and receive food (usually on a Monday or Tuesday- perhaps when the less experienced servers are working).  On weekends we usually make a reservation."}
{"text":"I will quietly whisper to people that I have been there, nothing really special to this Italian Restaurant. Unfortunately I will not be going back because Villa didn't impress me nor leave me with a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Nice environment but the food just doesn't compare to any other legit Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Brunchorama.  I forgot what a classy little joint this place is. Friends of ours got a groupon that they wanted to use for this restaurant and my husband and I hadn't been here for brunch (only dinner and that was awesome/ romatntic and incredibly delicious). It was, just like any other time I've been here, wonderful.  We sat in the back next to the windows and had a view of the cute little patio / smoking area (which no one dared to use as it was 30 below on this day).I just love a place that has an exposed kitchen. The cleanliness, order and professionalism of the staff / kitchen is top-notch.  The spicy caesars were delicious (although a little fresh horseradish would be a perfect topper). I ordered the baked egg special of the day and was not disappointed. The menu is always a great variety and the servers are knowledgeable and stay out of your way so you can really enjoy the space/ food/ company.  Because I moved away from the area a year ago I don't really get to enjoy this restaurant as much as it deserves to be enjoyed...but I'm glad to have ventured back to Bloor West for brunch at Villa :)"}
{"text":"Really unhappy with our dining experience at Villa.  1. Prices are on the high side for the quality, presentation, taste and service at this place  2. We asked to be seated at the front but were told reservations were coming in soon, we were initially seated at the worst place in the restaurant despite being almost entirely empty, it was by an external patio door and was freezing cold, how does a hostess not realize this?  We were moved closer to the kitchen where the smell of bleach from a freshly cleaned counter top was overwhelming.  Again, nothing crazy bad about this, but really lacking common sense, especially for a place that charges what it does.  (the place was still mostly empty when we left, including the seats we initially asked for)   3. Service was lackluster, and slow.  4. mains of Steak ($28) was a small piece of bland meat covered in a powdered mix demi glace or something, it was awful.  Side of a oily pasta ($8) was equally bad.  other mains of cod were better but a tiny portion overwhelmed by veg on the plate.  Chicken stuffed with asiago was decent but again, it appear to covered in some sort of pre-made sauce.  Not appetizing at all and took a long time to arrive despite the place being almost empty.  5. Servers changed without really saying anything and a new person came after some time to offer desserts, again at the prices they were poor, creme brule burnt on the outside freezing cold in the middle, chocolate cake overly sweet and stale.    6. 2 Glasses of house wine both tasted like they were from partially opened bottles from several days prior.    Overall really disappointed as we had high hopes for this place and it is located in a great neighborhood.  I will give them credit for legit stone oven cooked pizzas, which if I ever consider going back will likely be the only thing I order.  I hope they read these reviews and take them seriously."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight. My dining partner eats gluten-free and was really happy to see a gluten-free beer on the drinks menu. There were lots of gluten-free options on the main menu as well (pizza and pasta). He went with the salmon pizza, which came with plenty of salmon on a very thin crust. We shared the antipasto for two, which he was a big fan of (and I thought was just ok). I had the linguine di mare, which came with lots of seafood (good) but a little too much tomato.   Our waiter was attentive yet non-intrusive. I liked that he told us the ingredients of the soup of the day. Service was on the slower side, but just right for me to build up my appetite again after the filling appetizer. I was too full to order a dessert and missed seeing what was on the menu.  Overall a pleasant experience. It is pricy though. We had a groupon which is why we went in the first place. I made the reservation 45 minutes ahead of time, and was given a choice of seating in the back or front on arrival."}
{"text":"Support this business IF you want to support a woman who treats it's employees like garbage and then refuses to pay them their tip out/due backs (from credit and debit) and vacation pay after they stop working for them. People are awesome! *sarcasm*"}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood restaurant.  We had the beet salad and the mussels as apps.  The salad was a generous portion of well dressed spinach, with plenty of beets and toasted walnuts.  The mussels did not appeal to me as described since they had a sausage tomato sauce but they were really tasty.  I kept dipping bread in my husband's sauce and it was addictive.  My main was a properly cooked salmon fillet with fresh vegetables and my husband had the squash agnolotti which he loved .. Prices were reasonable.  We'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Came here after a long hike at High Park. We were a group of 11 with no reservations and the restaurant was able to accommodate us.   Initially service was slow, understandably since we were a large group. We ordered the garlic bread, shrimps + calamari, butter nut squash ravioli and linguine pollo pesto. All items were very good. The quantities were just enough but we were already stuffed with the appetizers so didnt mind it too much. The ravioli had a hint of lime which tasted really good with the squash. The pesto was good too, the sauce wasnt too much or too little but just right."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant today. it was awfulllllll !! lettuce in ceasar salad was sooo old and the croutons were burnt... and then my lunch...linguini pollo pesto..... AWFUL... tasted like those foods that are served in the airplane !! and filled with olive oil. I am a person who loves to use lots of sauce in the food or salad, but this was in whole another level !! NEVER GOING BACK EVER AGAIN !!"}
{"text":"So bad. They have the nerve to serve a pizza special which is at most a 6\" diameter on dry crust with tasteless, with oddly paired toppings. No wonder there was only one other table besides us having lunch. The house salad was limp and in keeping with the skimpy serving sizes, was eaten in 4 bites. Sad because the server belonged in an establishment worthy of his grace and poise."}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice and easy dinner. Nice atmosphere for a casual to upscale dinner. Great food and great gluten free pasta and pizza options!"}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot in Bloor West Village,  my friend recommended that we stop in here.   There are limited brunch spots nearby that don't have a crazy lineup!  The decor at Villa was super cute and modern.  The service was fantastic and they were very family/baby friendly! High chair and a kid's menu was available.  As for the brunch menu, Villa had some unique items such as breakfast pizza and their specialty - baked eggs.   I ended up ordering the eggs salmone ($14.95). Eggs were perfectly poached with smoked salmon and dill mascarpone. It was delicious!  There is a wood burning pizza oven for the pizzas and it is also used to make the baked eggs).  If I have friends that do not eat gluten, I would definitely recommend coming here!  :)"}
{"text":"The sheik ambience, modern decor and open style kitchen  set the stage for a stellar performance but unfortunately Villa failed to deliver.  Our group was walking around lower Bloor looking for a nice place to eat and Villa looked great so we decided to give it a try.  The waiter immediately got our drinks and pressed us to order appetizers which we declined.  We were then left to sit for a very long time until our order was finally taken.  I ordered the  strip steak and was very disappointed by the quality, presentation and taste of this meal.  The steak was under cooked and very chewy and drowned in a a barely edible demi-glace that tasted like it came from either a can or a powdered mix.  It was too thick and totally masked the natural beef flavor I had expected.  Most of my guests enjoyed their meal but no one was very impressed.  The service here is horrible.  The waiter was un attentive and didn't even check back after our entrees were delivered.  A few in our party needed additional condiments or something to go with the meal but were unable to request these items because our waiter just disappeared.   Overall I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone until they can show some improvements on food quality and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night since we had bought a Groupon deal recently.  With their open kitchen concept and the modern decor it gives you the impression of a more upscale Italian restaurant. But unfortunately they did not deliver on the food.  We ordered garlic bread and crab cakes for appetizers and a prosciutto pizza and stuffed stuffed sorrentini pasta for the main course. I have to say I was not too impressed with any of the items. The garlic bread tasted okay, however I found out later that they must have used a BIT too much garlic cause it's now the next morning and the garlic taste is still with me. The crab cakes were alright, but I had hoped for more. The pizza was plain hideous. The crust was so thin, you could basically see through it and the entire pizza tasted as if it had come out of the refrigerated section at Walmart. Very disappointing. The pasta was better, but I still was not too impressed overall. It just tasted not as a good as I had expected it.  On a further note: The service was certainly fast... the waitress was attentive - to say the least, but she was actually a bit too pushy. While we were trying to decide what we wanted she came every 2 minutes to ask if we were ready to order - and it was obvious that we were not. Maybe she meant well, but I found it kind of annoying.  On a positive note, she brought us some sourdough bread and butter for free to our table while we were waiting for the pizza and pasta. That was appreciated and we actually left her a nice tip as we figured the quality of the food is not her responsibility."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here and was able to snag a seat at the patio.  It is first come first serve basis but the hostess was on top of things turning over tables quite quickly so we did not have to wait long.  Had the beet salad, beef and mushroom risotto and chocolate mousse from the gluten free menu which was from the prix fixe menu of $35.  Great value and flavour.  The beets were ruby red deliciousness juxtaposed with  grounding flavours of walnuts and arugula and creamy goat cheese.  The risotto was full of beefy flavour that stood well with the red wine we had ordered.  Service was sterling from beginning to end and will definitely come back here again!  Tip: Osso Bucco is out from the menu for the summer so do not bother ordering it;)"}
{"text":"Running an Italian restaurant in Toronto is a tough racket to be in and competition for \"excellent\" is quite intense.  Bloor West isn't overflowing with great restaurant choices just now particularly since the departure of Dr. G's.    Villa and a couple of other choices in the neighbourhood are proceeding a bit on a \"high priced\" tack.  Food was very good at Villa the night we were there.  Service was good as well, bearing in mind that there were only 2-3 other tables occupied in the place.    I'll avoid culinary details and simply say that the food was quite good, though to my mind, overpriced.  I eat out regularly all over town and have been based in Bloor West for over 15 years.  Villa would be a good value and fairly priced if they knocked 15% off of the entree prices."}
{"text":"A very classy restaurant with a delicious menu.  The service is always excellent, the food is amazing, the decor is tasteful and modern... One of my favorite restaurants in the city! Definitely worth a visit, or two, or three..."}
{"text":"A great pesto should be the flagship of every Italian restaurant, but unfortunately all too often it's a neglected mixture of old basil, not enough garlic, and pine nuts left in a tin since your grandpa fought in the war. You know the war I'm talking about: the one that happened a long time ago.  Villa's pesto is fairly middle of the road: good enough to tide you over until summer comes and you can make your own, but not great enough to make you want to phone mum and tell her about it after asking if she's finished washing and folding your laundry for you, you giant man-child.  Less notable was the bruschetta, whose diced tomatoes were so pale and flavourless they were like the inspiration for making up some crazy comparison in a restaurant review to demonstrate to you just how pale and flavourless they were. I know it's January, but get me the sweet tomato flavour hookups for my bruschetta, Villa.  To me it seems like Villa is shooting to be a great Italian restaurant, but falling just short and ending up in the middle somewhere."}
{"text":"Had a salad with grilled shrimp.  It was very fresh and the grilled shrimp was good.  Service was good and quick.  Small outdoor patio out front, but we were a arty of 2 so it was good for us.  I enjoyed lunch.  Overall it was good."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who doesn't get excited about Italian food whatsoever this place has changed my mind quite a bit.   Its not that I don't like Italian food its just that I don't get that \"OMG I can't wait to eat feeling\" like I get with other types of food.   The restaurant is divided into two sections one being Villa, the other being Strada. Strada is a Mediterranean restaurant and Villa is an Italian restaurant. I have not been to Strada yet so this is only a partial review.   The inside of Villa is very nice, has a very modern contemporary look, fairly dark but it suits with the atmosphere of the restaurant. As well this is the first place that I've seen that has the kitchen right in the middle. It's not like it's closed off either it is open for the customers to see which I thought was pretty nice for a change.   Now to the food, considering I have only been to this place once I actually tasted alot of the food that is on the menu b/c I went during my friends birthday and we had about 20 people there so I just went from person to person asking them how their food was? And well they each let me take a bite too haha.   The appetizers. The one appetizers that stood out the most was the garlic bread. It was very well done, you get 6 pieces,it was crispy, not too garlicky, and the mozzarella cheese just made it that much better. The appetizers that I was not a fan of would be the crab cakes, reason being is for the use of imitation crab meat. The other being the grilled calamari, the presentation was nice, but to me calamari is not the same unless its deep fried.   Pizza! The have alot of choices for pizza, you can either go with what they have or you can build your own. The one pizza that I liked was the salmon pizza, the reason being it was different from the regular pizzas you could get at any pizza place. However if you are looking to get full I would not recommend getting the pizza BC its pizza, to me pizza is a snack not an actual meal.   Now for the pasta, each pasta was very unique, one person stuck with the traditional spaghetti which was OK, reason being there was not enough sauce, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like that much sauce on anything. The ravioli was very tasty and had alot of filling inside but the absolutely best pasta was MINE! I got the Linguini de Mare, which is basically seafood (shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops) with tomato pesto sauce. It was absolutely the best pasta I have ever had, the sauce was just right and was actually debating whether or not to get another one to take home.   The food was great however it got partially ruined b/c I found out that they don't do separate bills which is fine by me but having 20 people and trying to figure out how much everyone owes is ridiculous. My head was killing me trying to collect money.   Items to definitely get   - Garlic Bread with Mozzarella  - Linguini de Mare"}
{"text":"I love Italian food but the problem with going out with someone who has celiac disease, gluten free allergies,  is where do you go for food that won't kill you - and you don't feel like the one person that inconveniences the kitchen and server with all the food allergies? Well, my friends you have found a home.    My partners comments went something like this, `wow, i can order off the menu like a normal person. i can have more than salad!``  Gluten free options are available from the appetizers, the mains and dessert.  I cannot tell you how great a revelation that was because people, I really didn't want to go to the same vegetarian restaurants all the time.    So,  as the one person that can have all the gluten and meat options how does it rate for this carnivore? I would give it a 3.5 out of 5.  Portions are great. You will be full!   I had their classic spaghettini misti.  Pasta with grilled chicken, tiger shrimp, plum tomatoes and finished with chevre cheese.  I think I would have enjoyed it more without the chevre cheese.  The sauce itself I found to be a little too heavy or too rich.  The same could be said for the pizza melanzana.  Made it quite difficult for us to finish our meals.    I would definitely go back and try other dishes. It is promising.  I would like to note, the customer service here is incredible. It made for an extra special dining experience.  In addition, their next door upscale sister restaurant, Strada, apparently offers gluten free options as well.  I probably would have gone to that side but their website doesn't specifically state that option but it does as we were told by our server!"}
{"text":"Clean modern interior, bright if you're at the front, but drab down the side and to the back.   Service is poor, inattentive, and incompetent. Our server didn't know the specials, spoke slowly and was generally awkward. The host was no better.   Bread was served upon sitting down. Fresh, but flavorless. With butter, which is odd for an Italian place, no olive oil?   Pizza was tasty, with a thin crust, but was stupidly small for seventeen bucks. Yes, they call it a mini pizza, but they also charge $17 and it's not listed as an appetizer.   Salad was fresh, but poorly topped for the price.   Eggs Benedict had perhaps a quarter teaspoon of hollandaise, and a burnt muffin that made it impossible to cut.   It's sad. All they really need to do is bring in some new management to clean up the details and pricing. Unfortunately, it seems based on the other reviews that they've decided to go down the Groupon route and adjusted their prices accordingly, which simply makes it a terrible value for the rest of us.  Also, the question card they provided with the cheque was stupidly tacky."}
{"text":"Consistent, friendly staff,ok atmosphere, my kids favourite restaurant for a \"fancy\" dinner and in my neighbourhood. I frequently visit to enjoy the cozze with chorizo sausage .. But over all I've never eaten anything there that wowed me! The prices are outrageous for the food quality. If your planning a date or nice night out but don't want to spend a fortune on an experience that can easily be forgotten  Id suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice surprise. I was walking on a sunny sunday and most of the restaurants on Bloor were closed/closing, and I was desperate for food. I finally found this one.   They serve the brunch menu on Sunday until 3:30 and it was almost 4PM, but ok they were nice enough to offer me the brunch menu anyway. I asked for a simple small Caesar Salad, and husband asked for a complicated pasta with mushrooms. Completely different dishes.   I loved my caesar, it was fresh and not even close to \"small\". Husband's pasta was a bit overcooked, but he really liked the flavours and said they probably overcooked because it's fresh pasta. We were very well served and enjoyed our meal there. Will come back."}
{"text":"If you're gluten-intolerant and looking for a classy meal, Villa is a great option. This place really surpasses Il Fornello in every way, and it's obvious because the menus for both places are very similar, even though Il Fornello is a chain.  Everything we ordered compared favorably - more toppings, better gluten-free pasta, and fresher ingredients (judging by taste).  I think this place should be listed as \"gluten free\" but I can't seem to add this category to the listing.  There are plenty of \"regular\" items containing gluten, but it's nice to have that option if you're with someone who needs to order from the gluten-free menu.  It's not a stand-out place if you're judging it by it's \"authentic\" Italian  merit, but Villa is undoubtedly a great option for gluten-free! Service was good and the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Well, we tried this place based on the reviews. The place was jammed packed and the chefs were busy. It took a while to get our appetizers. When our appetizers came they were delicious.  When our mains came, my wife checked her tilapia. It was undercooked. The fish was dark and spongy. It was promptly taken away (as was my main course) and a woman came to our table (if she was the manager, she should have identified herself as such) to tell us that it was cooked and it was the bottom of the fish so it was darker. She basically told us that we were full of it.  Sorry to tell you this, but I cook a lot of things ... tilapia was on my menu two nights ago. I know when it's undercooked. It should be light and flaky. It's my personal opinion that quality control slipped because they were very busy.  The customer service was appalling. We did pay full price for everything (not that we expected a discount), but a gesture would have been nice (dessert) or something else??? ...  There's other restaurants to try in the city, and we'll be trying each of them before coming back here."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group for dinner, and we were impressed with everything we ordered BUT if was a bit pricey, especially for gluten free items.  The calamari appetizer was cooked perfectly, and the chicken and meat in other dishes were well done. The service was exceptional, wouldn't hesitate to return again."}
{"text":"Took my mom for dinner here before a movie. One of the servers was excellent, the other one...not so much. We ordered a large Caesar salad with extra dressing, with no croutons. What we got for 10 dollars was a plate of lettuce and dressing on the side. So we mixed our 10 dollar salad and asked for bacon, which you would assume for 10 dollars a Caesar salad, would be included, but we were charged extra. Which is fine we just made a mental note not to order it again as the dressing tasted like ranch and a better Caesar salad can be bought at sobeys...with bacon....for 4.99. Anyways on to the main, we ordered our favourite pasta, the chicken pesto. We asked to have goat cheese added which we were more than willing to pay for...when the dish came there was a minuscule amount of cheese sprinkled on top. You can imagine the shock when the bill came and we were charged 5 dollars for cheese...more than the bacon. I'm a server as well so I'm well aware extras cost money but I cannot justify charging 10 dollars for lettuce and dressing, and 5 dollars for a dash of goat cheese. My mom and I have come in and ordered out from villa a fair amount and we always wondered why it wasn't busy....we now understand. With the competition in Bloor west maybe it's time they stepped it up. We gave 2 stars because one of the servers was awesome and our pesto chicken pasta was delish...however we'll probably be ordering takeout if we feel the urge for that particular pasta."}
{"text":"This place had quite a nice atmosphere and if you are gluten intolerant you should definitely check this place out. Despite the warnings from my fellow yelpers about the overcooked pasta, I ordered the cannelloni and it was delightfully cheesy and well cooked.  I'd probably come here again if it wasn't for the price. Even with my $50 Groupon we still forked over an extra $30 to cover the bill for two entrees, sparkling water and garlic bread."}
