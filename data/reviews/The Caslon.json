{"text":"Great little gem in Avon Lake. Veronica was so nice to us on our first trip to The Caslon. We stopped by for drinks on a Saturday afternoon and we loved this place. Drinks were pricey in comparison to the area. The menu looked great, we will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great little place. Choripan sliders and loaded tots were amazing, not what was expected but amazing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a neighborhood bar that is a step above the typical dive bar with fried food, but not quite the fine dining- break the bank place, The Caslon is the spot for you. You first walk into a Sleek, modern, and bright decor, accented with walls of garage doors that open to allow you you enjoy the short patio season Ohio has to offer.   The concept of The Caslon is brilliant. Small plates, crafted cocktails and an eclectic menu, at a reasonable price.  I had the opportunity to try some food. Absolutely amazing menu left my group indecisive.  The tots I was most disappointed with. Great concept idea and great flavors, but the warm tots were topped with a cold sauce and cold meat, which threw the whole dish off. I think serving the entire dish warm, would bring it to the level I was expecting.  The mussels were perfect. I will admit I was thrown off by the oranges at first, But The sauce was heavenly, and the whole dish just worked amazingly well. I was eating the beer cream sauce with a spoon.   The chorizo sliders were good. It wasn't my favorite, but they were by no means bad. Spicy and filling, packed with flavor.   The lobster empanadas were delicious! Light and flaky, but surprisingly filling. I did think they were a little dry and could have used some type of sauce, but I'm a sauce girl!  The beef satay was also perfect. I'm not a \"slaw\" person but I ate every bite on my plate.   We didn't get the meat and cheese board, but if you are reading this looking for food recommendations you probably should get it. The tables all around us had it. HUGE portions of meat and cheese, I was drooling over it.   The wine list offers a decent selection of reasonably priced wine.   They have an odd, but decent selection of draft beers and your typical bottle selection.  The dining room is small, and can fill up quickly. The food took a little longer than I'd prefer, but the place was packed, and I assume they are still working out the opening kinks.  My only advice to management is to maybe offer a handful selection of \"big plates\" the men in my group were being polite, but I could tell left hungry.   I think this will be my new corner bar. I cannot wait to come back for a decent glass of wine after work, and some small plates. I would highly recommend checking it out to all in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Food was awesome and filling. Drinks were awesome, try the citrus martini or the Mexican 75. Owner and staff very friendly even with my 4 year old. And inside of the place is well decorated, clean and cool place to chill."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this pub. The cocktails were overpoweringly full of grapefruit juice even after I added another shot into it.   The lobster empanadas were a disgrace to empanadas, as well as being dry and crumbly (the lobster) to the touch.   The pear and prosciutto flat bread was not a flat bread at all. There were barely toppings, dry, and the proscuitto was chewy like gum.  The mussels were okay and the sauce was redeeming. But why on Earth was the bread not toasted? And better yet, why put canned oranges in it?  Do not recommend."}
