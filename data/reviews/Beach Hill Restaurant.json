{"text":"This has become a favorite weekend breakfast place.  The decor is very cute and cozy.   The food is always delicious and fresh.  The home fries are a mix of regular and sweet potatoes and are so yummy.  I love the serving of fresh fruit that comes on each breakfast plate.  Not your typical fruit salad, that contains all those filler melon pieces.  You get mango, grapes, apples, pears, oranges...and all very fresh!  I have eaten dinner there many times as well, and it is just as good.  The sweet potato-ginger soup is to die for.  So comforting on a cold night.  I start craving it if it has been a while.  The paninis are always great, too.  Very fresh and made with complimenting ingredients.  And the prices are very reasonable.  I love finding this gem of a place close to home.  We have yet to have a bad meal there.  I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cute place and the food is always fresh.  I think breakfast/brunch is probably their best offering although lunch and dinner are good as well.  This section of the Upper Beaches is finally coming around! The only problem?  When are they open?  Sometimes it's a crap shoot!"}
{"text":"My partner and I live in the area and have frequented the Upper Beach Cafe several times in the last year. Generally, we have been quite satisfied with the food ('just right' portions and not greasy) and the service. The last time we went, however, was kind of a disaster. We were part of a dining group of 4 and we went for breakfast. A few minutes after we all ordered, the waiter began bringing out the juices, coffees, and lastly the plates of food. It was only after I was the only one left without a plate in front of them that I was informed that the kitchen 'doesn't do' hard-boiled eggs for patrons because they take too long. That is all fine and  I would have been more understanding if only this information was given to me right at the ordering stage. I quickly ordered and received the lackluster yogurt and granola because it was fast to make. Another gaffe was that the server brought out a plate of food and sat it in front of a woman at a neighboring table. The plate sat there for almost 15min when the woman told the waiter that she didn't order that particular plate. Only then did the server bring the plate over to us and asked my partner 'if the food was his?'. He politely asked for a newly made dish.  I really like the UBC - mainly because it is a no-fuss and simple local diner. But I really hope they take seriously the comments of their diners so they can improve the customer experience. I would really like the UBC to be around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little cafe. I fear that it's discrete location may not give it the business deserves. It's a great place to grab a cup of coffee and breakfast/brunch. Great prices and they use fresh ingredients. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"It's closed so don't bother going there. Apparently it closed early this year. I got a gift certificate November 2014 and didn't get to use it. :("}
{"text":"Food was very good:  simple and well prepared.  Brunch items come with a lot of fresh fruit.  The service was quick and friendly, and the decor is minimal, clean and bright.  An excellent place for lunch or brunch if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been here a few times....This place is terrible, service is so bad and so slow! Thought I give them more than one chance and each time it's been a disappointment! Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"I hate to be negative, especially for a small business located right in my area, but we've gone here three times and every time it's been merely adequate. The service is friendly and reasonably fast, and the overall atmosphere is pleasant enough. But I haven't been impressed with the quality / taste of the food. The most honest way I can think of to describe it is \"average\".  As their prices are edging into the wrong side of reasonable it's hard for me to really recommend this place. This makes me feel glum as there really isn't much on this street besides the Upper Beach Cafe, and I'd really like to love this place.  As it stands, it'll do, but mostly because there really isn't anything else nearby."}
{"text":"Cozy and wonderfully tasty cafe with portion sizes that don't overload you.  We popped into the Upper Beach Cafe for Saturday morning brunch. It was around 1:00pm and we were seated immediately. Range of clientele - families, young couples, seniors.  We ordered the bacon & eggs  ($7.50) and the omelette ($9.99).  When our plates arrived, they were accompanied with an array of fruit - mangoes, apples, and strawberries.   Service was great - no complaints there. It looked like they also have a patio for summertime too.  Really enjoyed the brunch and didn't feel like a greasy, sloppy mess afterwards!"}
{"text":"My bf and I were excited to try this local restaurant for brunch as we had seen plenty of good reviews both on yelp and on facebook. Boy were we disappointed.  We were greeted as soon as we arrived as there was no one else in the place the entire duration of our visit. And it all went downhill from here.  Waited about 40 mins for a salad and a grilled cheese.  Both the salad and grilled cheese had avocado as an ingredient. Last time I checked, avocado was green not brown. The grilled cheese on the menu stated multigrain bread not a stale crusty panini bun.   Then to top it all off, there was a hair on the plate beneath the sandwich. so yes, discovered after having eaten most of the meal.   Disgusting. Will never go back which is sad as we live not too far and have been looking for a great brunch place.   In addition, our bill came to $36 for 2 coffees, a cobb salad and a grilled cheese with tomato and brown avocado. WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"In order of biggest pros and cons from highest to lowest:  PRO 1: Free street parking!!!   PRO 2: Jerk chicken eggs benny.  I think I'm in love.  While this wasn't exactly jerk chicken and more like a pepperish dry chili chicken, this was heaven.  What's more is that the poached egg was perfectly cooked, so when the yolk melted in your mouth, it's like you ascended even higher in heaven and almost met God's God. :-)   PRO 3: Chairs are fairly comfy, so you can sit in your chair without your butt getting sore. lol  There's not that many cons to this place, but I got to list them. CON 1: You have to walk down a narrow stairway, which makes you feel like you may be mauled and kidnapped...however that's Toronto resto's anyways - the actual washroom itself was fairly clean.  Con 2 (not really a con as well) - but my jerk chicken eggs benny didn't look as pretty as everyone else's.  :-(  Verdict: Awesome brunch place."}
{"text":"They've been around for a while and the fact there is no Yelp review coincides nicely with the rest of their marketing, low key...  But that has no relation to the food, service or atmosphere, it's all good and friendly...  In fact I've thought about keeping it my little secret, but that wouldn't be fair to the rest of the people in the area.  Mostly known for lunch/brunch, they are also open for dinner, but not real late, although I suspect if you showed up they would stay open ;-)  Curious??? check out their website:  http://www.upperbeachcafe.com"}
{"text":"Saturday at noon. Busy and humming...food was good, unique tastes and upper end ingredients."}
{"text":"Overall just meh.  Since I live in the area I was really optimistic that this would be a great walking distance breakfast/brunch spot, unfortunately this was not the case.  The service was pretty slow considering we were 1 of 2 tables in there and the prices are relatively high for how basic the food is. $14 for a smoked salmon benny that sits on some multigrain toast is over the top. The hollandaise sauce had a thin, oily feel. It was under seasoned (no lemon/acid) and I'm almost certain it was made with margarine not butter - gross. There are other places close by that are much better and definitely worth the short drive."}
{"text":"First time here today. Formerly called Upper Beach Cafe, the Beach Hill is a cozy spot in the neighbourhood with plenty of delicious menu options. We grabbed a table by the window and ordered 2 sandwich combos - jerk chicken and ham&cheese paninis - with side soups. Excellent coffee. Sandwiches: bursting with flavour.  The homemade veggie and sweet potato soups were just right, not too salty or overpowering. This place is run by good people. Yummy whole food for a great price! We will be back next time to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"always really enjoy this spot.  Great food and decent service"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time for breakfast when I lived on the east side. I was recently in the neighbourhood and decided to go back.  The bennies and the Big Breakfast were always my go too. Good size portions and quality food. Also, the coffee is excellent, which I find rare in most restaurants.  You can tell the chef takes pride in his food because he comes out sometimes and asks how things are.  Its not often too busy, which is also rare for a good brunch place in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Whenever I am feeling particularly rich, I treat my family to the Upper Beach Cafe.  LOVE this place.  The breakfasts are so anti-greasy spoon; at the same time being so tasty.  Love the varied fruit, breads and smoothies.  Great service.  Great food."}
