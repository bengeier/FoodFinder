{"text":"Great little gem squeezed in the middle of a plaza. I was there today but couldn't find it on my iphone yelp app, the restaurant name is Sushi House and in Korean they have Siloam.... anyways!  great tasting Korean/Japanese food at a reasonable price. From bean curd soup, pork katsu, sushi, sashimi, kalbi, bulgogi, bento boxes, amazing tempura Udon and much much more. ++++  the atmosphere is cozy and quiet  despite being right beside Sheppard ave. Great friendly service from this Korean owned restaurant!  We were there around 8pm and just another table occupied.  Past year we've been there 5 times!  lates  (i should of taken photos, yikes...next time!)"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at this place today since I was craving some good ol' Tonkatsu. It's been my 4th visit since late last year. All four times I ordered the tonkatsu and nothing else. Even though this is supposedly a sushi place, I already have my favourite spots for good sushi so this is simply one of my go-to spots for breaded deep-fried pork cutlet-y goodness!  The place is never full when I am there (there were only 2 other people there when I went today). Service is good (it should be considering I'm one of only 3 customers lol). I don't think I'll ever be trying any sushi here any time soon, neither would I bring friends here to go eat. I'll keep this one of my \"secret\" places I go to alone to satisfy my occassional cravings for tonkatsu. I'm not ashamed.  Though I give the restaurant an overall rating of 3 -- I would give their pork cutlet dish a whopping 4! *fanfare* :)  (oh, and they charge you $$ for tea now -- unlike before)"}
{"text":"Right when you enter the restaurant you will be cheerfully welcomed by a lady who by far is the most heart warming hostess I've ever met. You couldn't ask for a better one!   As for food I ordered the sushi boat and a Korean raw crab dish. For the sushi meal it was introduced by a couple of fried tofu with a sweet sauce along with miso soup as it should. Both tasted very good and left a warm and happy taste to my tongue. For the sushi it was nothing out of the ordinary and I had no complaint.  RAW CRAB DISH: it was introduced with korean side dishes such as: kimchi, bean sprouts, potato, radish... which all tasted formidable. As for the raw crab I was kinda disappointed as it seems to have been previously frozen. Taste was okay but had a lot of meat so I was satisfied.  Overall, exceptional service, food taste just over okay."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was called Siloam Sushi. The sign out front says Sushi House, Korean and Japanese Restaurant.  I came because my brother had come before, and had told me it was good. He had the Korean food. As soon as I sat down, I decided Korean food wasn't what I wanted. The reason for that is because it's not particularly cheap, especially considering that there's so much good Korean food on Yonge for cheaper. Siloam Sushi's pork bone soup is $9.99. Not cheap.  I ended up getting the pork cutlet lunch special ($8.99). It came with salad and miso soup. The miso soup was standard. I'm a fan of salad dressing, but this one had too much vinaigrette on it. It was also served quite oddly, on a small plastic sushi boat (like one for appetizers). I was expecting my pork cutlet in a bento box, and served with rice. It was actually served on a plate with three side dishes on it, if I'm not mistaken. There was stir-fried zucchini (a tad salty), julienned slightly spicy pickled radish, and sweet fried potatoes and onions (I would rather have sweet potato, but this was quite nice). Oh. I lied. Four side dishes. There were two pieces of agedashi tofu (deep fried tofu with a sweet/fishy/savory soy sauce). The agedashi tofu was the crispiest I've ever had, but it also had a fairly thick skin which I didn't particularly like. I have a feeling they use Korean rice (on their sushi too. I had some of Grandpa's rolls, and the rice was a tad too soft). The pork cutlet was crispy and the portion was good, but they put wayyyy too much sauce (think worchestershire mixed with ketchup) on it.   All in all, a decent lunch, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Pricey for lunch bento take out plus a dragon roll. Dragon roll is very dissapointing, 9$ for tiny roll only consisting of rice, tempura shrimp, green onion, nori, fish roe. No side dish was given for my take out. Bulgogi bento was super ordinary and also pricey for 9$ as lunch special. Dissapointed"}
{"text":"Our office used to be located within walking distance of this restaurant and I would come here all the time for lunch and dinner. We moved about four years ago and it's not often that I get to come back so it's always a treat when I'm able to.  The restaurant itself is tuck in amongst other stores in a 'strip mall' type plaza and if you blinked, you'd miss it. The parking is limited and kind of awkward but believe me, it's worth the frustration.  This evening my husband ordered the Salmon Teriyaki bento box which came with 6 California rolls, yaki mandu as well as your typical soup, salad and rice. ($12.95)  I was actually surprised at the size of the salmon fillet that was served and the little piece I stole from his plate, when he wasn't looking, was cooked perfectly.  I ordered their Chicken Teriyaki which came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and side dishes of potato, zucchini and sprouts. ($14.95)  Now I tend to judge all chicken teriyaki by this restaurant and when having chicken teriyaki at other restaurants, I have often said, \"meh, it's okay but it sure isn't as good as the Sushi House\" (which is what I'm used to calling this restaurant).  The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of grill on the meat... smothered in teriyaki sauce and served over a bed of onions in a cast iron... umm... cow.  The side dishes were fantastic and I have to admit... I had to order a second helping of their potatoes! Soooo good... and definitely one of my favourite things here.  The service is fantastic and they are really attentive to food sensitivities and allergies which is nice.  I have great memories of this place and even though it's been a couple years (at least) since I've been here, it's as good as I remembered! Great food, great service, happy tummy."}
{"text":"Small little place. Ordered the seafood udon  it was good but the seafood with tiny and they don't give you much. Husband ordered don Katsu which he enjoyed but has had better. Portion was large. They don't really give you much ban chan (Korean side dishes). I had to ask for kimchi and they knew I was Korean. The staff was friendly and checked on us which is rare. Overall a solid 3."}
{"text":"Everything was properly cooked and to our liking. We ate mostly from the Korean part of the menu. Service was very friendly and we honestly had a very good overall experience."}
