{"text":"We walked in on a Tuesday early afternoon and it wasn't too busy, naturally.  The place is immaculately clean and stylish for a sushi restaurant in a plaza. The service was outstanding - fast and friendly! I don't pretend to know a lot about sushi, but I have eaten it a lot at many different places over the years, and these guys made some pretty tasty avo/cucumber rolls and Gem.Tao chicken (not sushi, I know, but so so good!). Both were part of their daily specials with miso and salad all for $6.95! I would highly recommend it and we'll definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"Average all you can eat place. Fast service"}
{"text":"Our favourite Japanese restaurant! Excellent quality, generous portions, competitive pricing, nice high tech decor, convenient location.

Sushi has unusually thin rice layer, generous filling and well above average variety of ingredients, skillfully rolled.

Our first 2 outings to Mizumi were within a week! Highly recommended!

Update - the bento box is probably the best value of the many Japanese places we've tried."}
{"text":"Worst food period. My husband and I got delivery from here last night and most of the food was inedible. We got three rolls of spicy salmon which were ok although very small compared to other sushi restaurants we've been to in the past. We got an order of fries and when they got here they were so soggy we had to throw them out, we ordered the salmon belly appetizer which I thought I would love but turns out it's just the little ends of the salmon fillet which has all the fat and skin on it so there was almost no salmon at all to eat and last but not least we got the spicy sechuan tofu which I thought would be like the spicy tofu at sechuan sechuan but was actually flavorless pieces of tofu and veggies drowning in a bowl of sweet sauce which made it look more like a soup but one you cannot eat, in the end all we ate were the sushi rolls an my husband made me promise never to order from this place again and I agree"}
{"text":"I only went for pick up, but this place looks pretty good inside. One of my friends lives across the street, she had a flyer with some coupons so we decided to give it a go. She ordered for her and her boyfriend a variety of things - beef and broccoli, sushi and a noodle dish of some sort; I ordered the Chicken fried udon noodles and a 6pc spicy salmon roll. They seemed to like what they got, I didn't ask, or if I did, they didnt say anything bad.

I liked what I got though, lol! The food was filling, flavourable, and they didn't cheat me on the extra hotsauce on the side as some places like to, which I appreciated :). The sushi was really good, especially for the price.

They have some really good deals on their menu flyers, and they've also linked up with just-eat in case you were looking for delivery. For the speed, price and taste of this food, 

I'd definitely come back again.

If they keep up the good service/food/prices, this place will become a popular staple in our area."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out since it was near by. We got there and we thought the place looked ok but then we were met with the disgustingly rude waitress. 
We opted for all u can eat and ordered a variety of items. We barely received half of what we marked down and what we did receive was inedible. We figured ok it's ayce so we have more coming up. After a 20 minute wait we didn't get 1 thing. 
I then asked to speak to a manager since no wait staff seemed to care and was told there was no manager.... When I complained he told me there is nothing he can do except ask them to make the food we ordered 45 minutes before. Any other place that would have been fine I guess except the food here was so tasteless and fishy I asked for our bill since we just wanted to get out there. Once we got up a waitress ran right over abruptly to make sure we paid the right amount which was extremely rude.  Safe to say I will not be back. I suggest against this place."}
{"text":"Very slow service, food was being made and literally sitting on the counter after it was made and it was sitting their for 10 minutes before someone decided to bring it to us. Such slow service I couldn't believe it. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"A great mix of sushi and typical chinese delivery food.  The sushi was good, but the General Tso Chicken was GREAT.  This place has made it into my delivery rotation."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I wrote a nice review for this place recently.  I now wish I could retract it!  I walked in today at 3:27pm (the time on my cell phone, which most people know shows actual time as accurately as possible since it's satellite-controlled).  I waited about a minute & a half before anyone in the restaurant acknowledged my presence. The All-u-can-eat LUNCH ends & All-u-can-eat DINNER begins at 3:30 SHARP -- no exceptions.  Again, I was in the door at least TWO full minutes before 3:30.  When the hostess finally greeted me, I asked for the All-u-can-eat LUNCH and she said \"Lunch is over.  We serve dinner now.\"  I showed her that my cell phone clock displayed 3:29pm, and told her that I had been waiting for two minutes.  She then told me my cell phone clock was wrong, and pointed to a clock on their microwave oven behind the counter, which showed 3:30pm.  The manager was standing there, and he also said, \"It's 3:30.  Last-call (lunch) is over.\"  I smiled & said I can only afford to eat lunch, and reminded them that I was standing inside the doorway for at least TWO minutes before anyone greeted me; and, I also reminded them that two weeks ago they told me that their policy was that as long as I arrived before 3:30 I could stay for lunch & continue to order past 3:30.  Again they said, \"If you want eat now, you order dinner.\"  So I said, \"If I walk out that door, I'll NEVER come back.\"  They said nothing, and didn't seem to care that they were losing a repeat customer.  

The food isn't bad, the restaurant is attractive, and nobody beats the $9.95 Tuesday All-u-can-eat lunch special.  But the service is awful, and out of principle, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  

If you want to eat lunch, you'd better get there WELL before 3:30pm."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a AYCE sushi near my place. The sushi comes in big portions and taste pretty good.  Unlike some other restaurants they do not stuff their sushi with alot of rice.  Service is pretty good, they refill drinks often and the food comes fast.  There are fried foods but I tend to stay away from them in sushi restaurants because I am there for the sushi.  Overall, great place to eat and I will be back."}
{"text":"Was very hungry so stopped here. Convenient location. Had all you can eat. Food was good. Portions good. Good service. Didnt like the rainbow roll. Don't have that! Hand rolls were delicious! Good place. Price - really good but u get what you pay for. 3 stars cuz of rainbow roll and ice-cream was not that great. Rest - ok"}
