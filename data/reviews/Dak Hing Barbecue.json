{"text":"Without a doubt, the BEST Cantonese-style BBQ this side of Hong Kong!

Located near the Montreal Jewish General Hospitals, this is one tiny joint that serves up all your favorite comfort yummies, from BBQ pork, roast pork, roast ducks, roast chickens hanging in those traditional glass showcase windows. 

The best deal is: 2 or 3-combinations of ANY of the above-mentioned BBQ items for $10 -12, & the portion is absolutely H-U-G-E!!!! & yummy, too!!! I make sure I make Dak Hing my must-go each time I come back to Montreal from California, in California, the amount for the price is unbelievable, they can easily charge double or triple the price!

The lady owner is also super nice, go and get your fix, you will love it, your wallet too!!!"}
