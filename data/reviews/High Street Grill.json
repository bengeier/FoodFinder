{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS! The staff was nice and friendly. The construction has them hidden but when every other bar had a super long wait I was able to go in and get my food quick and have GREAT  service! I will definitely be returning! They have great potential and I wish them nothing but the best!"}
{"text":"They've not renewed the Cleats franchise and have gone on their own as \"High Street Grill.\"  The menu was a joke...two b&w copy paper dirty sheets stapled together offering a very basic bar menu.  Honestly, my 9 year old could have written a better menu on his computer.  There were two people working when we visited, and despite the place being empty, it took forever to get served.  So the same guy that poured the drinks then had to chop chop back to the kitchen to suddenly become our chef.  Look, I understand it's a one man band, and five orders slammed them.  The food quality was awful.  The drinks were watered down and our kid that had soda complained that it was way too syrupy.  It will be a miracle if this place survives a year with the status quo and without the Cleats franchise...but I don't see how they could afford the Cleats name with such a horrible location, hidden on East 2nd St.  Come to this establishment if you want a dirty atmosphere, bad drinks, bad menu, average food, dirty restrooms and an empty restaurant that appears to be in disrepair."}
