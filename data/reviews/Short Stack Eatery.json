{"text":"Food is still good here, but ventilation is still an issue. They've installed a few fans in the dining area, but I think what they really need is a new exhaust fan to suck some of the oil out of the air. Please? I want to love you, Short Stack!"}
{"text":"After walking by Short Stack Eatery for the past few Saturdays and seeing a line out the door, I had been dying to try it. As someone who hates waiting in long lines for food, I would definitely recommend visiting Short Stack for dinner to avoid the wait. The ordering process is quite unique in that you order and pay for your food before having a seat. I decided to order the blind special, which is a great option if you are looking for a breakfast surprise and discount!"}
{"text":"I get why this place is popular. It's cutesy, open 24 hours on weekends, and there aren't too many breakfast options I know of in the general vicinity unless you want a boozy brunch. A good place for college kids to go on a casual date or bring their out-of-town parents.   However, I thought the price was much too expensive for the small portions, it is loud, food is meh (I can make better pancakes at home), and the service is basically non-existent, which sucks if you have a problem."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this latest trendy breakfast restaurant so I decided to try it.  Unfortunately the entire experience was very disappointing.  I ordered the short stack of blueberry pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, and a glass of orange juice.  The total price was $14.95 before leaving any tip (which seemed very pricey even if the food wood have been incredibly good).  Unfortunately the food was very mediocre at best.  The place was not crowded and I was the only person in line to order food.  There were plenty of empty tables as well.  It took well over 20 minutes for my food to show up and it was not warm (not sure why it would have taken so long- no real reason) The pancakes were also  very dry (not fluffy, but flat and hard) and had only  5 blueberries scattered across all three tiny pancakes (when I ordered I was lead to believe the short stack pancakes would be very large, in reality they were each smaller than my first in circumference.  They did mention they were low on blueberries when they delivered my food and decided to substitute non-ripe/hard greenish strawberries instead and asked me of I hoped that was okay.  It would have been nice to have been told that before I ordered.  I didn't really have a choice since I didn't have time to wait for them to make me something else.  The bacon was actually good and the fresh squeezed juice was okay as well (I've had way better though - this was clearly a little watered down).  The meal didn't come with enough syrup either and nobody ever came around to offer more syrup or ask how everything was.  I personally love breakfast and am willing to pay for quality and good service.  Unfortunately my experience had neither of those."}
{"text":"Love the concept, especially the late night weekend hours, which in my opinion is the best time to go. If you are like me, and can't stand the chaotic Sunday brunch feeding frenzy, go late at night or on a weekday.  The staff is largely young, cool, and friendly. The decor is fun and interesting- we love the old letters and postcards that make up the facade on the table-tops. Especially late at night, it's a place that is easy to settle into for a few hours.  The Bloody Mary is really the star of their menu. It's like a boozy, pickled salad in a cup! If this is YOUR drink, you have definitely got to try it. Although I don't regret ordering it, it was a little on the vinegar-y side for me and I couldn't finish it. Definitely a food experience to remember.  We love the idea of the blind special, which is what my husband always orders. Beware though: we were told by one waiter that \"sweet or savory?\" was the magic question you could ask and still get the 1/2 off price. I asked that and was charged the full price for the dish, which was slightly irritating to me.  The food itself is solid, and I've never been disappointed in the taste. Something about this place keeps bringing us back!"}
{"text":"I got the cajun biscuits and gravy and my husband ordered a coffee.  The total was $14. The coffee was good.  The gravy and the eggs part of my dish was good but the biscuits were not.  They were dry and over cooked.  Personally when I get biscuits and gravy I expect buttermilk biscuits and these were not it.  Also it was pricey for something that wasn't that spectacular.  I would be interested to try something else here but for now I can't give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"Takes forever. Service is shitty. But the food is above average. Don't come if you have anything to do in the next two hours."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The food is top notch. Favorites include the Cajun Biscuits and Gravy and the Pulled Pork and Grits. The menu is filled with ingredients from locally sourced purveyors (the coffee is amaze-balls). I'm also a huge fan of Bloody Mary's in general and SSE makes one of the best - 21 ingredients, thick, chewy and refreshing. Short Stack Eatery really proves you can have breakfast anytime."}
{"text":"As eager visitors from Los Angeles,  we happened upon Short Stack while walking downtown.   The food was really tasty and gluten free pancakes were awesome.  The place is really nicely decorated with a nostalgic feel -- but no smiles from the wait staff.  As mentioned in other reviews,  you order at the counter and then grab a number (cutely placed on a retired license plate) which sits on your table until your order is ready for delivery.   The bummer may have been the position of the table at which we sat, but every person who passed by us or who brought over drinks seemed stressed,  overextended (3pm in afternoon with no crowd there) and just generally so unenthusiastic that our excitement at being there was substantially diminished.   Also, staff seemed loathe to help when I was trying to find sweetener for my iced tea which wasn't offered upon delivery, and the direction to find it neither.   As I wandered to the other side of the restaurant in search of it, nobody at the counter paid any attention as I struggled to make sense of what eventually presented itself in the form of a poorly marked baker's rack stocked with various condiments as well as sweeteners.   In addition,  while really tasty, the quantity of food on the plate seemed way too small  given the cost.   My iced tea, organic,  but glass filled with lots of ice,  took 3 long sips to imbibe,  and no refills are given.   Overall,  disappointed because we wanted to LOVE this place,  and thought we would've -- but we didn't leave thinking we'd go back.   Bummer"}
{"text":"Overall good food and service. We got the breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich on Stella's cheesy bread with cinnamon hazelnut coffee. The only problem was we went in mid June, and they were not running the ac. It was ridiculously hot in the restaurant which made it hard for us to enjoy our food and the experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced subpar food. Paid $19 for scrambler and 2 small glasses of milk. The scrambler was burnt. The waiter that brought the food asked \"if she could get us anything else\", I asked for hot sauce, she then pointed me in the direction of the condiments stand I.e. Get it yourself. I'm glad I tipped for that great service. They had no potatoes, how does a breakfast place run out of potatoes?"}
{"text":"You know they are legit when their line is out the door.  I highly recommend going with the blind special. I didn't have any qualms about it and it was fantastic. I had a side of eggs that were perfectly cooked. Half the time when I get them medium they're easy. Here, the yolks were just the right amount of runny. The fresh orange juice was also very good.  Brave the line. It is worth it."}
{"text":"A common problem I have at restaurants, especially for breakfast food, is that the portion is too large. So I really appreciated that Short Stack has lots of portion options and I was able to order just the right amount of food for myself. (I had the orange juice and a half order of the Trio.)  They gave me the larger size juice when I didn't specify a size. No big deal, but good to know for next time. Also, my meal came with hot sauce on the side. Since I don't like spicy food, that was a bit of a waste, but I was able to get other condiments so no real complaint there either. The only actual annoyance was that it was a warm, humid day, and it was uncomfortably warm inside the restaurant too.  Still, the food was delicious and reasonably priced; the staff were friendly and helpful. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome blueberry pancakes!  Just the right amount of berries to make the meal tasty and portion size was very filling.  No syrupy berry sauce either....fresh blueberries on the side to top off a superb breakfast staple meal!    I can't wait to order this again :)"}
{"text":"Short Stack Eats epitomizes the Madison breakfast scene. Atmosphere is comfortable and the location is prime. Food left nothing to be desired and will definitely bring people back again and again. Short Stack Eats fills a unique niche that has something to offer for anyone who dines with them!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Friends and I came in for a late dinner and we left very happy.   I order the Trio ($8.99 + $2.00) which came with 3 chocolate chip pancakes, a side of fresh fruit, and two slices of bacon (extra charge for the bacon). The pancakes were fluffy and scrumptious. Three pancakes definitely filled me up, so after the crispy bacon, I was stuffed. In addition, I ordered a small orange juice for (~$5). Though the price of the orange juice was a bit high, the orange juice was very fresh and yummy.   The only qualm I have about Short Stack is it's location. Because it's downtown, parking may be a little difficult to find; but nonetheless, nothing comes between me and great food!   Excellent restaurant for a late night meal, highly recommend those chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Short Stack and it has been really really busy on numerous occasions when I passed the place, especially so on Farmer's Market Saturdays. So that arose my curiosity.   On my first time there a coworker and I picked what we thought was an off-peak time -- Sunday afternoon, to go. It wasn't too bad, there was no line and we could get a table right away. Only thing is they'd ran out of french toast by that time and my friend had wanted that.   Price wise I feel their pancakes are reasonably priced, some of the stuff could be priced a little more competitively, but being where they are and all, it's not a bad deal. My friend had the blueberry pancakes that came with only 4 blueberries... which was a pity cos he said the blueberries were the best part. I am still having an eternal craving for biscuits and gravy so I had that. Two huge buttermilk biscuits with cajun sausage gravy, topped with two eggs, which I am pretty sure you could pick whatever style you like. I like my biscuits and gravy. Their sweet potato pancakes are another great option, healthier and not any less tasty and flavorful.   While we were there the music was pretty loud, together with the chatter of the other diners, it was hard to hear each other over our meal. Water is self-serve over by a wall at the back just fyi. One more thing: it will be good if their online menu can be kept up to date, some of the pricing are not current.   All in all it's a nice place to go for breakfast/brunch/dinner/whenever you feel like having what they offer on their menu. They open 24 hours starting Thurs all the way to Sun, so it's great for post-overture center shows and the likes."}
{"text":"Their \"25 ingredient Bloody Mary\" tasted like dill, pickle juice, and sugar. That's it.   The pancakes came out doughy and undercooked, not unlike chewing on butter-flavored taffy.   Have you had the new breakfast menu from Taco Bell? No? Then come to Short Stack Eatery and try the breakfast burrito. Cheap flower tortilla, over salted, mushy ingredients. They claim that the burrito contains chorizo, cheese, and potatoes but it may as well be Fancy Feast with hot sauce.   If you're looking for a breakfast place at 3 AM after a long night boozing on State (we came here at 5 pm on a Sunday) and don't have a car that can get you to Denny's or Perkins then come here as a last resort only. If you're drunk enough not to remember the food then count yourself lucky.   I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food (the cajun biscuits are a must) and the friendly atmosphere is unlike anything else in the area. Food is a bit overpriced for the service that is offered, but it is a perfect choice if you're looking for a yummy and casual breakfast!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes with cinnamon mascarpone were probably the best pancakes I've ever had, and I have had breakfast and brunch at just about every Madison restaurant that offers it. They were so light and soft and flavorful! No syrup needed. A little mascarpone on my fork, a fresh strawberry slice and a fluffy pillow of pancake bite was just heavenly! My husband really enjoyed the Cajun biscuits and gravy. The gravy was not the typical cream gravy but rich and meaty and plentiful!  Not many places serve a properly done egg when ordered \"over medium\" but these were perfect. The Bloody Mary  is complex, spicy and has tasty house pickled veggies including an awesome radish as garnish. My son had the chocolate chip pancakes  which he liked, and my daughter and her fiancé loved the breakfast burrito. We had plenty of leftovers, and I can't wait to finish my sweet potato pancakes tomorrow morning. Service was prompt even though all the tables were occupied. Next time, mimosas!"}
{"text":"There have been a few failing restaurants in this location before Short Stack, but I think this one will be a keeper. I went here for the first time a few nights ago and was very impressed. Walked into friendly and smiling employees, great aromas, and overall a great vibe. Ordered my food at the front, received a signature license plate, and grabbed a booth. Food came out in no time smelling and tasting terrific. I ordered and recommend the sweet potato pancakes, blueberry pancakes, and cajun biscuits. Overall a great experience. I'll see ya soon!

{"text":"Cool little breakfast place. Good pancakes. Is it worth the chaos? Idk could probably get the same breakfast and be more comfortable in the same vicinity"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that they serve real coffee, no cheap, generic diner crap. I love that it's self-serve too. Friendly staff, food is hot and fresh. We are regulars now!"}
{"text":"I went to Short Stack for the first time this weekend and had a terrific brunch experience. The Bloody Mary was one of the best bloody marys I have ever had! Spicy and delicious! I also had the breakfast burrito which was tasty. A very hearty portion (needed to share it) and great breakfast potatoes on the side! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a popular place, as evidenced by the line to get in that, on weekends, never disappears. The food is definitely worth the wait - the pancakes are fluffy and delicious, and the savory fare - excellent across the board. On the other hand, considering that the place is mostly self- serve, things could move a little bit faster and smoother.  Overall, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my pancakes (I like them to be borderline crêpes, so I'm never impressed), so I wasn't blown away, but everyone else loves this place, and it's the only restaurant filling the niche of \"pancakes at 4am\". This place should stand the test of time."}
{"text":"I have been to Short Stack Eatery multiple times, and each time the service has gotten worse. The worst experience being last night, when it was not even busy. I ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes and it took over half an hour to make. People who ordered AFTER me got their food before I did. There were only 2 other tables as well, and one table was still covered with empty plates the entire time I was there.   Furthermore, the girl who took my order was insanely rude. She had glasses and brown hair pulled back. I asked if I was able to split a stack between blueberry and chocolate chip and she responded in a snotty tone \"we don't do that here.\" One member of our group had a gluten allergy and required hers to separate from the others. However, when we politely asked for them to separate and mark which one was gluten free she said in the same snotty tone, \"I put it on top.\" For a restaurant that is only open Thursday to Sunday, she had an extremely unprofessional attitude, which deters me from going there again. I suggest that if they plan to stay in business they need to work on their customer service and learn how treat people in an acceptable manner."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday morning. As always there were lots of people waiting in line. Food was good but no where outstanding. I think service was lacking and almost everything was self serve. i recommend the sweet potatoes pancakes."}
{"text":"Food and more good food. Had an Eggs Benedict here while I was visiting and was really good warm. Its cozy and warm here. Feels like grandmas kitchen a little bit. I was just amazed on how the decor was done. I sat at a window seat with post cards underneath. I coud have read them all but was working. Great place and good variety"}
{"text":"Decent pancakes with good syrup.  Had breakfast at 7:30 Sunday night with family of 6.  They all ordered pancakes, I ordered savory special for half price. Bland and tasteless butternut squash hash with spicy horseradish sauce.  The place was empty, the waitress aloof, and the cook was as kempt as an auto mechanic after a double shift.  Stay away if you want to keep your health and taste buds."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and ambiance. It's been decide that SSE is our new location for our family's Black Friday brunch tradition!"}
{"text":"It was the best breakfast in all of Madison! Everything we ordered was delicious with perfectly blended flavors and seasoning. The Bloody Mary was truly the best in the world!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. If I could eat at one place for the rest of my life, this would be it. If you like breakfast food and you like locally sourced ingredients, this place is heaven. Their food is seriously the best breakfast food I've ever had and I've been around the diner block. And it blows my mind that all their ingredients are locally sourced. Wow!! Best pancakes I've ever had - I recommend the sweet potato pancakes. And you HAVE to have their milkshake that they make with ingredients from Sassy Cow Creamery, my all-time favorite dairy farm. I grew up hating white milk and their milk converted me. Sassy Cow products are amazing. Anyway that milkshake is to die for. Try this place. You will leave with a full stomach and a smile."}
{"text":"OMG.  Some of the best bites you can have in Madison.  I'm obsessed with this place.  The most unique Bloody Mary in town, a great idea for a special of the day- \"the blind\".  Order it as it sits for $7, or $11 if you're chicken and have to ask what it is. (They will clue you in to whether it is sweet or savory).  If you're a savory breakfast type, try the breakfast burrito or the corned beef hash.  They take pride in their ingredients, and it shows."}
{"text":"We were excited to come to short stack because we had heard good things. We got coffees and a short stack, and though the coffee was great, we'll never know how the pancakes are since we waited over 40 minutes and our food never came. Many people who ordered after us received their meals, and we ended up leaving with empty stomachs. We went to marigold kitchen instead, and it was amazing. Not going to waste our time at short stack again, next time we'll just go right to marigold."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about this place. Food is mediocre and overpriced for the portion size.  There are so many staff members, but no one seems to be doing anything.  We ordered pancakes and sausage and waited close to 45 mins to receive the order.  As it was our first time there, we didn't understand that you had to get your own water, which is located in the back of the restaurant.  When we asked the waitress we got a snide answer.  Skip this place and spend your $15 at nearly any other Madison breakfast place."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelmed by the food. Had the eggs benedict, lack of flavor and pretty \"meh\". My friend had the trio,the eggs and potatoes were comparable to something you could make yourself at home. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and decorations. Laid back with great cinnamon coffee. Maybe come back for the milkshakes I saw others drinking. Will not be coming back for the breakfast food unfortunately."}
{"text":"I came here again after visiting a friend out in UMadison. Food maybe good but service is simply bad, that's it."}
{"text":"Tried Short Stack for the first time today.  Absolutely a return visit is in the works.  Had the cajun bisquits n gravy.  Yum.  Nice bisquit with a darker colored gravy full of this spicy sausage.  Kickin."}
{"text":"This place is dead to me.  Will never return.  Unfortunate concept that was poorly executed.  Mediocre food on top of it all."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch during our weekend stay in Madison.  I'll be honest, I saw the reviews and because we were bringing a group of two families with young children, I was scared because of the seating situation and lack of A/C.  Luckily, we must've gotten there early enough (9:30ish) because we were able to order and get seats no problem.  My wife got the French toast, our son got the sweet potato pancakes and i went for it with the blind special which that day was the omelet with a salad.  The omelet was good but not great but hey, that's the risk of playing the game!  The French toast and pancakes were awesome tho!  Next time and I hope is a next time, I'll have to get one of those.  My buddy and I were hoping there blind special would be the breakfast burrito but next time, maybe I'll just order it.  And based on how others were enjoying their Bloody Mary, I may have to get that too!  Definitely a great brunch spot if you are visiting Madison!"}
{"text":"Sadly, another style over substance restaurant in downtown Madison...  My husband and I went on a Saturday morning around 10:30 am. It was busy, but we expected that given the day and time. We were told that once we ordered, it would take about 40 minutes to get our food, which seemed excessive, but we decided to give it a go.  We ordered at the counter and managed to snag a table. It was extremely loud and difficult to carry on a conversation--not ideal when facing a 40-minute wait time on the food. I watched a lot of servers wandering around with drinks or plates in their hands, desperately searching for the correct table, and it seemed like maybe this place is a little too busy/crowded for the order-at-the-counter format.  Food finally arrived. Husband got the Cajun biscuits and gravy, which he really liked. I got the breakfast scramble, which was good but nothing special, and was a bit cool as if it had been sitting for a while. The sourdough bread was standard. The cheesy grits were bland. Prices felt a bit high for the amount and quality of the food.  Overall, it's meh. Certainly not terrible. Nothing that made me want to run screaming for the hills. But definitely nothing special, and no real reason to go back. There are way better breakfast places in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm a little brunch crazy and Short Stack definitely lived up to the hype. I had a breakfast sandwich with the green salad and it was awesome. I highly recommend the bloody mary, it was amazing. The atmosphere is great, the service was quick and the food was all fab. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting granddaughter at UW at.Madison. Read review on yelp and decided to try. Long line on sunday, but certainly worth the wait. The french toast was to die for. Others had waffles and pancakes, also excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but their terrible business model takes away from how great this place could actually be.   You walk in and it's generally jam-packed, so you inch your way towards the counter where you'll place your order. They give you a table marker to place at a table of your choosing (seat yourself), but since it's so crowded in there, you're usually left huddled around the bar, waiting for a table to open up, and waiting for your food. At times it has been so crowded that the runner brings my food out to me and I haven't even been seated at a table yet. And when a table does open up, you have to basically sprint to it to snag it before another party does, which generally means you'll be sitting at a table with dirty dishes all over it until you can find a busser to wipe it down for you. It's complete nonsense.   Forget about coming here with a group of more than 5--especially if you want separate checks. Not only will you struggle to find available seating, you'll also run the risk of everyone's food coming out at completely different times. As the customers, we know that we came in together, but we don't necessarily understand that with YOUR system, we have to inform you that we're all a group if we want to see our food within the same time frame. That should be a question that the cashier asks bigger parties. It doesn't have to be a pain in the ass--a simple \"how many in your party?\" at the end of taking an order would smooth things over completely. The last time we came here, my husband and I had my food nearly 30 minutes before our friends did, and we only ordered a minute before them!   The food is absolutely the high point of Short Stack. Everything I've had has been fresh, hot, and prepared well. Their eggs Benedict is delish, and I definitely recommend trying the blind special (definitely the best value) considering I've never NOT liked something here!  I was stoked to try the Bloody Mary because they're my favorite and I saw that this one was made with house-made vegetable juice. It was AWFUL. Do not waste your money on this garbage! While the vegetable base is fresh, it's not puréed to a fine enough consistency, so you end up getting chunks of carrots and beets sucked up through your straw. There is not nearly enough tomato flavor in the mix, and it is TERRIBLY under seasoned and basically flavorless--I couldn't taste any celery salt, pepper, or spice at ALL. I ended up shaking about 1/4 of a bottle of cholula into my drink because it was just so bland.   All of that in mind--this place is overpriced...which could have something to do with their business model. It's quirky and fun that they're open THE WHOLE TIME between Thursday and Sunday, but are they raising their prices to compensate for the lack of business during off-hours?   Furthermore, are you supposed to tip here?? And if so, is it 20% or what? I hate that if you're paying with a card, you basically have to write in your tip before you even know how the service is going to be. Had I known that I would only be tipping on food delivery and getting my table wiped down, I wouldn't have given a 20% tip because there is barely any actual SERVICE. My guess is that a lot of people have this mentality, and so their employees are given a higher hourly wage to compensate for fewer tips. Is this discrepancy also related to the menu prices?   Who knows...but this establishment could surely benefit from dropping the \"hipster\" mindset and employing traditional restaurant practices--hosts, servers, and busboys. If that were the case, I would absolutely want to come to this restaurant. For now, though, that's not really the case...I've been here once on my own accord, and two additional times, reluctantly. Three strikes, and you're out."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food is great, and the line moves pretty fast. It was out the door and I think we waited ten minutes. I got the French toast (a small order is one slice less and is still very filling). It comes with marscapone cheese that is a clever addition. It's a place with a fun concept and great food."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Madison!  I have lived in Madison for 4 years and have tried a majority of the breakfast/brunch restaurants in the downtown area.  Short Stacks is by far the most unique and delicious food!  Do not be scared of the line, the wait for breakfast is worth it. Favorite dishes include the breakfast sandwich, oatmeal sweet potato pancakes and the Cajun biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"was in madison for a short amount of time and decided to come here since the wait at Bassett Street Brunch Club was way too long. I am SO glad we ate here instead!! hands down the BEST brunch i've EVER had. definitely recommend the breakfast potatoes and pecan french toast. My husband loved the chocolate chip pancakes. I'll be going back there for sure next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I adore short stack!  great hours! Equally lovely for Sunday AM brunch, or bar-time drunken gorge.  amazing blood mary's.   The line can get quite long though."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful all around! Came here on a Saturday at 1 pm. Every table was full and the line to order at the counter was decently long. However, by the time we  finished ordering plenty of tables had opened up and we sat down no problem.  Everyone at my table ordered a scramble of their preference and we split an order of the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes. These pancakes are seriously amazing. You just have to try them to understand.  Another stand out are the breakfast potatoes served with a side of sour cream and Tabasco sauce. I don't know why I've never eaten breakfast potatoes with sour cream mixed with tabasco before because it was delicious!  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their house cocktails as well. I ordered a mimosa and it was honestly one of the better mimosas I've ever drank at a restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice makes all the difference.   As someone who lives in Chicago and regularly brunches, I would return to short stack again and again if I could!"}
{"text":"To start off, I was extremely excited to try their Bloody Mary.. It's something like I've never had. However I basically had to chew it, yuck. The only flavor I could taste was the beets, I asked the lady up front if the beets are overpowering she said no you barely can taste them.. Our case that's all you could taste. I had two sips of it and couldn't take it anymore I asked the bartender if there was something she could do, she said \"yeah you can buy something else..\" Very helpful, NOT. I got a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes, the menu said the chocolate chips were throughout the batter... Which was NOT the case, the top of my stack had chocolate chips on top of the top pancake that was it. My other two pancakes had NO chocolate chips on them, basically a waste to order the chocolate chip ones. Overall the 45 min plus wait was definitely not worth it. :/"}
{"text":"Great place but I'm not a fan of out-the-door lines every single time I go here. If you don't mind that read on. Good food with lots of interesting choices and options for GF eating.  They have a fun \"mystery dish\" that if you don't ask what it is you get it for a good price.  It's not leftovers; it's usually something interesting and fun.  Order at the front and a server brings you your food.  Good decor."}
{"text":"Short stack?  More like medium stack.  These cakes are modestly sized but will fill you up faster than you can say the alphabet twice.  Will return after many genderations for a good discussion over a stack an d some fresh squeeze oj"}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to the hype!  My husband and I met a couple of friends here last Saturday for a late breakfast. Of course, by that time, the line was already out the door between the hungover college kids and the odd couple from the farmers market. We were a bit skeptical at first, but we decided to wait it out, and it was definitely worth the wait. They were moving people through quite quickly, so we only waited for about a half hour.  The atmosphere was very fun and friendly. The decorations fit the bill with even a chandelier made out of whisks! You order at the counter and find a seat for them to bring your food out. They have a self-serve water and coffee station. The kitchen window is close enough to be able to see them cook the food and all of the different orders people had!  I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was way bigger than anticipated. My husband went for the \"Blind Special\". (They have this fun little idea where if you order the Blind Special without asking what is in it, it is half price--if you ask what is in it, it is full price! The special changes weekly.) It ended up being a zuchinni and onion pancake type thing, with an egg and fresh greens. I thought it was delicious, but my husband was a bit disappointed due to it being vegetarian.  Overall, the price for such high quality breakfast and service in Madison is a great deal! We will definitely be going back the next time we are downtown--even if there is a line!"}
{"text":"Arrived at Short Stack desiring Eggs Benedict, was told they were fresh out, so I opted for the overly spicy Cajun Biscuits & Gravy.  Waited over a 1/2 an hour for my food to arrive -- how long does it take to spoon up some gravy and fry up some eggs?  Folks at the table next to me who came in much later, got their food sooner than I did!  Then as I was leaving, I noticed a couple sitting nearby (who got their food in like 15 minutes) eating -- you guessed it, Eggs Benedict!!  WTF?!?!  And the prices -- $11 for B & G, $2.75 for a serve yourself cup of coffee?  The service was horrible, i.e., no service, save for delivering my food (w/o apology or explanation for its lateness).  Plus my clothes stunk from the poor kitchen ventilation.  Disappointing, frustrating, never again.  Listen, if you want a nice, simple breakfast, go to the Good Day Coffee Shop at 101 S. Webster St. inside the DNR Building. The food is prepped fast, and is hot, tasty, expertly cooked and reasonably priced.  One egg skillet: $ 5.25 including coffee.  Nice ambience, too.  I had a pretty view of a courtyard."}
{"text":"I had the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes and they were very dense and mildly underdone. My husband had the French toast with the \"frosting\" which he loved and really enjoyed it. The blueberry lemonade was intensely sour - would not recommend. We will likely try again and I'll skip the sweet potato pancakes. The atmosphere is pretty cool. We loved the old postcards, letters and recipes at our table!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me to SSE, and I was a bit skeptical at first, given the absurdly long line, as you order at the counter and then sit. Yet even though it was a Sunday, the staff worked so quickly we had ordered and found a table within 10 minutes.   The gluten-free pancakes are to-die-for. I've been GF for years, and never I have I had pancakes so rich in flavor and so perfect in texture, despite trying varying restaurants, boxed mixes, and recipes from scratch.   My boyfriend ordered the blind special, but if you don't ask what it is, you get it for 1/2 off! You're allowed to ask about allergies, though, and so I could even try some of his, which was this amazing sweet potato and sausage casserole, topped with fried eggs.   In short, great place, great food, but as bit too crowded, too hot (no AC!?!?!) and way too noisy (there's nothing to absorb the sound) place for a relaxed meal, but the food and the friendly staff make up for it."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast joint for any time of the day. Food was terrific, service was very friendly. Chocolate chip pancakes with real maple syrup was delicious. The French Toast was by far the best thing on the menu. Best French Toast I've ever had. The decor was pretty unique and your order number was on a license plate. Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"The eponymous short stacks of pancakes are delicious, but I also recommend the Cajun biscuits and gravy, eggs Benedict, and for sure the Bloody Mary. The \"blind special\" is a fun idea (pay half price if you let it stay a mystery until it is in front of you) & between two tries so far I have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for a big breakfast a few weeks back and stopped in at Short Stack with a few friends to see how the restaurant that took the place of the forgettable T Sushi (and countless other establishments).  All of my friends decided to order the biscuits and gravy and absolutely loved their meal. I opted to grab a breakfast sandwich with breakfast potatoes and a stack of blueberry pancakes.  The sandwich: it was up there with the best I've had in Madison. They cheat a little bit by using Stella's spicy cheese bread but I'd question your sanity if you held the delectable, curd-filled goodness against them. The bacon and eggs were cooked to my liking and not a crumb was left. I'd eat that every day if I wasn't worried about living into my 30s.  The potatoes: Yikes. The best way to describe the taste of their potatoes is dirty dish water. They lacked any real seasoning outside of an abundance of rosemary and appeared raw. At the end of the day, it's a side...but how do you mess up potatoes that bad?  The pancakes: Just right. The cakes were light and fluffy. They weren't the best. They weren't the worst. But, I'd have them again.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will be back."}
{"text":"I went to brunch at the Short Stack Eatery this morning and my experience was really underwhelming. After waiting for 45 minutes in the heat, I thought that this was going to be amazing, but I found the grits and pulled pork dish to be really bland and watery. Usually cheesy grits are much creamier and cheesier and have more salt, but these definitely needed more flavor. The most complicated part was that, after waiting in line for 45 minutes, almost all of the tables were empty and there were about 5 wait staff just sitting behind the bar joking and talking with each other. It seemed as though they weren't sure what to do with their time. I love brunch in Madison and this is a great city for eating breakfast food--I was really unimpressed."}
{"text":"The pancakes are great but I may never order them again. Because: I just discovered the best breakfast sandwich in Madison. Stella's cheese bread, bacon, egg, and rhubarb jam for just a touch of sweet. It was amazing. Also, they have a seasonal rhub-berry margarita made with jalepeno tequila which is balanced and delightful."}
{"text":"The food was very good! They accommodate very early risers which is much appreciated;however, there were several homeless loitering as I was trying to enjoy my meal. It was intrusive how loud the homeless were being. I would say order the food to go to avoid the unwanted company(homeless vagrants). The restaurant has a lot of potential, but they need to clarify their demographic."}
{"text":"This delightful diner at the corner of State and Johnson is bright and airy, lively and busy. Two sides of the dining room are solid knee-to-ceiling windows, offering great views of the bustle on one of Madison's busiest corners, even from the depths of the back of the restaurant. The staff are friendly and efficient. The menu is extensive and fun and interesting.  It's popular for a good reason. It's a dream for those (like me) who are - of necessity - gluten free. The pancakes are DELISH, and they serve real maple syrup. That fact alone will keep me coming back. Be ready to stand in line, outdoors, at busy times, though I was just there for the second time, and at 11am on a Friday we got right in."}
{"text":"I always look for a good breakfast spot when arriving jet lagged from Europe - and even though I've been many times back to Madison since grad studies in the late 90ties - I have never made it to SSE They really do great stuff from the pancakes to the granola"}
{"text":"24-hour brunch. It was really nice to find such a restaurant after 12. The blind special pancake is a very exciting idea. I ordered it yesterday night and it was very tasty!   The only thing I would suggest to change - kill the FLIES!!!! We sat indoor and there were at least three flies around our table."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to eating here for awhile, so this past Sunday I stopped in around 7am for breakfast and some paper-reading time before continuing with my day.  It was disappointing.  My food was good.  I had the breakfast burrito and enjoyed it.  The restaurant itself is comfortable and is a great place to relax and watch the world go by on State St.  At least it could have been.  When I walked in, one of the first things I noticed was the loud music playing.  It was turned down just a bit, but as I sat down with my cup of coffee, I was treated to more music -- from a different source -- coming from the kitchen.  So  now I'm listening to two different songs at pretty much equal volume.  Not long after that, someone in the kitchen (which is open to the dining area) started using what sounded like a Shop-vac.  This went on for at least 10 minutes before I'd decided I'd had enough and left.  I can cook my own breakfast at home, so going out to eat in the morning  is something I enjoy, especially on a Sunday when I can read for awhile with a second cup of coffee.  Not sure I'd come back here to do that. The staff seem more interested in entertaining themselves than in providing a good atmosphere for customers, and the Shop-vac?  I can't explain it."}
{"text":"Would give it 0 stars if I could. First thing I realized when I walked in was that the prices were 25% higher than listed on their website. We asked for a recommendation for a filling dish as we were quite hungry. He recommended their rice special dish. It was basically a some rice with two goat McNuggets in it. Flavor was okay but it was not nearly enough food. Also I ordered egg curry and never received it."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised to see a few negative reviews here as this restaurant is fresh on the market and still finding it's appropriate niche.  HOWEVER, I completely disagree with anyone complaining about the setup of the restaurant.  The immediate ordering system is fantastic for ensuring your food gets in right away and quickly, especially those stopping in on their way to work or class.  I got my food within 10 minutes of arriving.  The food itself was great!! I am not a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, saw a few positive review about it and my expectations were exceeded!  The eggs were cooked to perfection, and as a college student, I'm sad to say the over easy eggs I thought I'd finally been getting right over a year and a half are still not quite there yet.  The housemate biscuits were incredible, and the gravy had a great flavor.  Lots of meat and perfectly spicy.  Anyone used to spicy foods would love this.    I'll be coming back again to try the pancakes.    MY ONLY COMPLAIN, for being a breakfast place, I'd have to say I wasn't impressed with the coffee, because they don't offer espresso I would at least look into upgrading your beans a bit."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of hype and is always busy but is very mediocre. The interior is fun and funky though"}
{"text":"I cannot describe how much I love brunch and breakfast food and Short Stack definitely hits the spot. Located near the Capitol, I would have loved to been a student at UW and frequent Short Stack. Visited there with colleagues twice last month. The first time was for dinner ( so wonderful they open for dinner!), there wasn't much of a wait and I decided to give the blind special a try. I ended up with the Cajun Biscuit and Gravy. Went a second time but weekend brunch instead and had the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes with mixed greens and breakfast potato (trio). The wait was about 25 min which wasn't too bad. The Cajun biscuit was good but I loved the pancakes! Portions for the pancakes are pretty reasonable. The wait can be long and it can be loud inside with the crowd, so bring your patience."}
{"text":"Don't be scared by the line out the door! It goes fast and is actually the line to order. After you order you can sit down at a table and your food comes out relatively fast. I've tried a few things here but my absolute favorite is the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes! They are to die for!! I even tried making them at home. The strawberries and cream on top make it absolutely delicious. The burrito is also a good pick."}
{"text":"This place is not only adorable, but delicious. You order at the counter and grab a table. They have a sweet and a savory breakfast menu, with a number of unique and fun drink options, including a 25 ingredient Bloody Mary.   I loved the sweet potato pancakes with mascarpone and fresh strawberries. The cheesy BBQ pulled pork grits were also amazing!  They also have traditional eggs, bacon, potatoes and sourdough toast, which are good portions.  The restaurant is open for brunch and late night, for breakfast anytime. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This was pretty much the rudest service I have EVER seen at an establishment before in my entire life. The customer service was extremely rude. When I tried to call in a complaint on an employee, I was treated with complete disrespect. The first time I called in, the manager told me her name was 'Alice' and hung up on me. The next few times when I called her, she told me her name was NOT 'Alice' and proceeded to hang up on me again. I would NOT recommend coming here as the staff and management does NOT seem to be receptive to any kind of criticism and does NOT seem to want to improve its service to patrons. There are so many better places in Madison that serve breakfast/brunch - Marigolds, Merchant, etc. that have excellent service. I would never go through the suffering that a dining experience at Short Stack would provide based on its horrible customer service and management."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor is awesome. Don't be put off by the line outside. You order at the counter and then find a seat where your meal is to be delivered. The old license plates the table numbers are written on are really cute. The coffee is good and the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are amazing!!! Christmas in my mouth.  Chocolate chip pancakes are good as are the waffles.  Side of potatoes are seasoned with something I couldn't identify. The sauce on the side is a vinegary hot sauce with sour cream (not my preference honestly), but they have ketchup available too (: . Will come back for those pancakes. I eat out a lot and I'm very picky but those pancakes are probably the best sweet breakfast I've ever had. Pure bliss with the coffee!"}
{"text":"Pretty poor experience overall. You order at the bar and seat yourself. I ordered an ice coffee and eggs, bacon, and hash breakfast potatoes. We sat down and didn't even get our beverages brought to the table, so I walked up to the bar after 15 minutes and asked if my iced coffee would be brought to the table. The bartender looked at my like I was an impatient asshole and said it would, which it was a few minutes later. Got the food after 45 minutes of waiting. Very mediocre. The breakfast potatoes were completely undercooked and hard. Eggs and bacon were nothing special. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast restaurant. The reason for four stars over three is because of the delightful blueberry pancakes. Very delectable. The reason I did not award five stars is because of the long wait to get our food. The system here is as follows; walk in, order from front counter, grab number and sit down. You then wait for your food after you pay at the counter and this step took an extremely long time for me and my family. Combined with the great food which was enjoyed by myself and my group this restaurant has earned a solid 4 stars.  Also I saw a golden retriever puppy outside while I was eating and I left to go pet it and it has been the highlight of month so far. His name was copper and he was 9 weeks old. That is all."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in Madison. The food is so worth it! It favorite go to is the eggs benedict. There was definitely enough hollandaise sauce so that nothing was dry, the eggs were poached and so soft and delicious, and the breakfast potatoes had so much flavor! The grits had a good amount of cheese flavor without being overpowering. The food is just so delicious and all the breakfasts I've had were just so filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while, and now I wish I would have done it sooner. I really liked the relaxed and stylish ambience, while displaying socioeconomic activism. Staff were welcoming, friendly and attentive. Plus the food was hearty and tasty, with both vegetarian and vegan options for me, and \"meaty\" for my friends. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and love it! The first time I came on a weekday morning with a friend.  We shared a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel roll and some blueberry pancakes.  The pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious.  The sandwich was an amazing mix of flavors--love the caramelized onions.  I especially liked the potatoes that came on the side--creamy, crispy and cheesy--comfort food at it's best. The second time I came in the evening with my husband and we shared the breakfast sandwich (which we both loved) and the french toast.  The french toast is now by far my favorite and the memory of it makes my mouth water.  It was made with crusty french bread with just the right amount of sweetness and both chewy caramely and a bit crisp-- not one bit soggy.  So amazing! Both times the service was fine--you order at the counter and get your own coffee/water so not much to mess up there.  The second time was in the evening and they made fresh decaf for me.  Both times there were several other occupied tables, but not crowded.  Our food came fairly quickly. I definitely recommend this place.  I'd be eating here all the time if I went downtown more often."}
{"text":"I love this place. I mean who doesn't? I have a regular order-- a trio of sausage, shortstack, and breakfast potatoes-- that I eat with unreasonable pleasure. Especially the breakfast potatoes dipped in the hot sauce/sour cream mixture. I've ordered the blind special twice-- once it was a very good breakfast sandwich and once it was cornmeal pancakes with heirloom tomatoes and goat cheese that was so good I'd give them one of my non-thumb fingers to put it on the regular menu (only sort of joking). The biscuits and gravy are also very good, but I travel to NOLA too regularly to want to eat creole food in Madison. Essentially-- you want to eat at this place. It will complete you. And if you are a no waiting person like me, you want to eat it at non breakfast/brunch hours of the day. Because you can. And it will be heaven."}
{"text":"Good times even during hard times. The AC unit is out today and it's 85 degrees outside, but the staff are still genuine and sympathetic with customers"}
{"text":"The short stack is certainly a favorite for me.  For those who like a surprise and don't have food allergies I highly recommend the blind special.  9 out of 10 times I've loved it.  The one time it was a miss might just be a personal dislike for butternut squash.  Some of my favorites included : green(pesto) eggs and ham, savory French toash, and veggie hash.  Not up for the surprise? Their menu is otherwise spectacular for breakfast dishes. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love the sweet potato pancakes! But I have noticed that they taste a little different every time I go here. They are always good, but always slightly different.    I ordered the biscuits and gravy one time, and it was good, but not as good as the pancakes.   The decor is super cute, too. :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Great vibe, great owners, amazing brunch food, and love the artisan ambience of the space.  The location is very cool as well, right in the heart of downtown.  Try their award winning bloody Mary's as well!"}
{"text":"Great food. Unique taste. Chocolate chip pancakes - awesome! You might have to wait for some time to get seated and to get your food at peak hours (Talks about the quality of the food here.) Ambience is okay."}
{"text":"Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes!!! Omg this place has theeeeeee best pancakes ever! Really cute, warm, and comfy spot - healthy mix of UW students and locals. I did try the award winning Bloody Mary just for kicks, by it was my first time trying it and I just think that it was too intense and flavorful for me as a newbie? - for someone who loves Bloody Marys, you may want to try it here! I also loved the fact that they are a woman run business and were currently promoting Women of Color month - with specialized drinks for the occassion, go Short Stack!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are delicious but quite filling, so the short stack will definitely do. If there on a Saturday, get there early since it is a popular breakfast spot. Fast service and the portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"Madison has a thousand places to brunch, but this is a must try. Not only do they serve all breakfast all the time, you can order \"blind\" (they bring you something random) for only $7. Their bloody is unique and refreshing - juiced from fresh vegetables including beets. My favorite part is you can order a short stack and entree if you don't want to pick between sweet or savory (which I never do). I highly recommend the pulled pork and cheesy grits!"}
{"text":"Awesome: the breakfast sandwich, especially with Stella's cheese bread as the base and potatoes on the side. Delish and addictive! The place is very cute, and I love the focus on local ingredients. The other dishes I didn't order looked really good too!  Not as awesome: the pancakes were only fair, which was surprising since that's their title. They left a weird taste in my mouth, and the blueberries tasted oddly chemically. The saddest part was that there was about sizable raw part in one of my pancakes. :(   Unawesome. Is that a word?: Other customers were pretty aggressive/rude about snagging tables before they even ordered. Do the staff members have to play table cop like at Marigold? Come ON people, wait your turn.   A good experience, and I'll be back to check out other dished ... Just not the pancakes! Also, it's a busy place, so this is not the place to go for a quiet chat. But if you don't mind a little bit of noise and snuggling at tables, it's a-okay."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here today. We ordered French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns. The meal was delicious. Nothing but compliments to the Chef. The French toast is out of this world!  Atmosphere is warm and relaxing. Casual dress and you also wait on yourself for small items, I.e., coffee, tea, water, jelly, maple syrup. All of which is set up on a stand for your convenience."}
{"text":"It's not often I give 5 stars but Short Stack deserves all of them. A women run business, Short Stack serves breakfast from Wednesday through Sunday only. Be ready to stand in line at any given time of the day, but know that the wait is worth it. You'll order at the counter and then sit wherever there is space. They'll give you a number on an old license plate and about 15 minutes later, your food will be served. It will be hot and delicious, guaranteed.   During this visit to Short Stack, I ordered the Eggs Benedict with the hollandaise on the side. The eggs came over easy on apple wood smoked ham and a homemade biscuit. For my side I chose greens, which were dressed in a light balsamic reduction. I would eat this breakfast over and over again if given the option. A winner for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you walk by and there isn't a line, don't hesitate to hop in. Great breakfast and coffee. Meat eaters, get the corned beef hash. This is the best I've had, because it is fresh meat, crisped up, and not overly greasy.  Pancakes are light, fluffy, and tasty too."}
{"text":"Love their Cajun biscuits and gravy! And the atmosphere is unique and my family really liked it! My kids really enjoyed the chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite brunch place in Madison! We always get the blind special and it has literally never disappointed us! I also recently got the biscuits and gravy and it was so delicious! The sweet potato pancakes are also one of my favorites. I love that this restaurant offers many of its dishes in \"short stacks\" for pancakes or just generally smaller orders. The ambiance is perfect and don't forget that they're open 24hrs from Thursday to Sunday!"}
{"text":"This was the best tasting French toast I've ever had. The marscarpone and bourbon maple syrup accompanied so well.   The coffee was delicious. The fresh squeezed OJ was great. The buttermilk pancakes were fluffy and light. Service was lacking, which is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I didn't like that you have to order, then fight for a table. The staff ignores you after you get the food, so make sure you check you have everything you need before they disappear."}
{"text":"Day 507: Wisconsin Road Trip Part 6: Short Stack Eatery: In need of morning sustenance, we drove through the web of Madison's one-way streets and confounding parking regulations to Short Stack Eatery. It was a nice, fun little diner-type place with a line out the door and a level of pro-breakfast propaganda on the wall that might well be described as Soviet-Era in nature. I got a Breakfast Trio with some decent poached eggs, some fine sour-dough toast and a short stack of fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Also, I got a glass of the Sassy Cow Milk, which had been talked up to me while we ordered. It was... good milk, I guess? Maybe I just don't have the taste buds to be a connoisseur of such things. Whatever. It was a good breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a favorite of the locals. It's only open Thursday through Sunday but it's open 24 hours in that period. I like to do the blind special because you get your meal half price! Really rich food, good portion sizes."}
{"text":"A Summer Saturday morning brunch may not be the best time to enjoy this cute little restaurant for the first time, mostly due to the line and heat inside. Those are my only two complaints, but other than that the food was delicious (we got the burrito and chocolate chip stacks). The customer service was also quite delightful."}
{"text":"Limited hours. Annoying but effective.   Things I've tried:  Sweet potato pancakes: scrumptious! Tastes like carrot cake.   Breakfast burrito:   Delicious and greasy. Eggy and cheesy with chorizo goodness. Pretty large plate for me but I'd say average for most people. You will be full for sure.   Cinnamon Hazelnut coffee: I'm sure they rotate the coffee selection and I usually go for bold roasts but this was pretty good and free get it yourself refills!   Interesting fact: Blind special is half off if ordered blind!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch and late night breakfast option in downtown Madison.  My friends and I were planning to eat here after March for our Lives, but the line was excessively long.  When we came back around midnight, it was quieter but still busy.    After ordering at the front and getting a license plate for a table number, we found a booth and excitedly waited for our food: The blind (savory): Mediterranean breakfast plate; came with 4 pita pieces, eggs, olives, cheese, and cucumber tomato salad.  Overall, very decent. Sweet potato pancakes with strawberries and marscapone: amazing, would definitely order again. Flavored lemonades: I loved the flavor (blackberry thyme) and especially the crushed berries that were mixed in.  The character and business model of this restaurant are quite unique, and both the food and service are very good.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"For a hispter brunch spot, Short stack is your place. Come Sunday this place fills up very fast so get here early if you can. I love breakfast so I love to sample 1 of everything so I will order off the sides. The pancakes are amazing here, I just got the regular pancake because I'm a simple girl. With the a name like Short stack (i.e pancakes) they better exceed the hype. My favorite plate was the French toast with fresh fruit and bourbon-maple mascarpone. Not to mention they use sourdough and sourdough is the best for french toast anyway. They know what they're doing. It's a little expensive for brunch-but they do choose their ingredients wisely. My boyfriend is an adventurous eater so he wanted to experience the blind special but there is risk in it, you can't ask what it is and you get it half off for about $6.50. So if you're looking for mystery, go for it. I, on the other hand always browse menus before I go some where because I like knowing what I can expect from a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I want in a breakfast spot! The decor is eclectic and funky, the food is yummy and hearty, and they hold awesome community events like a charity dinner for Porchlight, a local shelter and social services organization for the homeless. I have yet to try any of their boozy beverages but I'm sure they're delicious too.   I've had the eggs Benedict, the biscuits and gravy, the you-pick-three breakfast trio, and the blind special and I haven't been disappointed by anything so far. My favorite things I've eaten here though are probably the blueberry pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes were fluffy and moist and not too dense. The biscuits and gravy were heavy but in the good, stick-to-your-ribs, hearty way. I wanted to smother the sausage gravy on any piece of food I could find.   Totally unrelated side note re: the ambience of the place: I am a huge fan of Gilmore Girls and this place gives me Luke's vibes - not because they have a surly owner (the service is always great) but because it's cozy and homey and you know your food is always gonna be solid. And I live down the street from them so maybe I can become a regular like Lorelai and Rory...."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner at around 8 pm on a Saturday night. I was excited to find real breakfast place that was open for dinner. The place was pretty empty at this time - only 2 other groups of people, maybe 6 people total. There appeared to only be the cashier and the cook working.  The ordering experience was strange - despite this looking like a real restaurant, you order at the counter. But don't be confused like I was, ordering at the counter means ordering at one specific place at the counter (where the register is). I thought sitting at the counter was sufficient. It wasn't.  That aside, once I ordered, the food came out in about 10 minutes. I ordered a small portion of the biscuits and gravy, which was 1 biscuit, 1 egg. It was delicious, my over medium egg was perfectly cooked, and the biscuit and gravy was also excellent. I only wish this was a bit cheaper. It was like 7 dollars and a very small portion size.   I definitely recommend this place if you're on state street and looking for breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in mad town.  We always go here every time we come to town.  Expect to wait a while, but it's worth it.  Pancakes are great.  All egg dishes are great.  Sides are good too.  Have an adult beverage with breakfast, we like the mimosas.  Only warning is the Bloody Mary is terrible.  Self serve coffee and water is convenient and helps the staff focus on service.  Great value and staff is always friendly and helpful.  The place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Don't be scared away by the line out the door. You wait in line and pay at the register, then seat yourself. Even though it might look packed, as soon as we were through the line, we could seat ourselves.  Service is pretty fast and food is delicious! Definitely recommend the Sweet Potato Oatmeal pancakes.   They have a secret special every day and will tell you if it's savory or sweet. If you don't ask what's in it, you get it half off. An incredible deal! I've never heard of anyone who was disappointed with the special.  Super cute place to be with lots of different kinds of drinks to choose from. Def recommend! And get a SHORT stack, it's definitely enough food."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've ever been too.  Love the farm-to-table concept.  I love getting the trio with buttermilk pancakes (DELICIOUS), eggs (perfectly seasoned), and fruit cup."}
{"text":"Really yummy, cute décor, and friendly people, however; there should be a better system for seating. Often times I am standing in line and I clearly see open tables (no there are no reservations) and the register just cannot keep up. Other than that, a great place."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place, very busy and noisy but fresh and delicious food!   I love the decorations. a chandelier made of whips, plants in tea cups, green walls, old envelopes and letters under the glass covered table. Very adorable place!  I was lucky to get a seat right away when I came by at 10am on a saturday, however I was warned that food will only arrive in 35 minutes after ordering. I waited 15 minutes for my friend to arrive and then we ordered after a hard time deciding our pick for the morning.  The volume in the place got louder and louder as the hour passed and we started to have to shout to be heard. Not the best place for heartfelt conversations, perhaps great for after drinks hungry hour.  I ordered the cajun biscuits and gravy! i am so grateful they have small orders for petite eaters like me. One gigantic biscuit, covered in amazing gravy and a sunny side up egg. mm mmm... SO GOOD. love how the egg goes with the spicy peppery gravy. very nice crust on the biscuit, great layers, held up very well with the gravy. and there was just the right amount of gravy to finish the huge biscuit! love it!  My friend had the trio, with eggs, potatoes and bacon. she said the potatoes were really good and bacon was thicker than store bought bacon. she loved it!  I would definitely be back, BUT, i would get some pastries or get something to eat before coming back for brunch..."}
{"text":"If your going to be good at something be the best and SSE is killing it. We made our way  for a Thursday brunch and upon arriving the quote said Brunch without booze is nothing but a sad late breakfast\" So of course we had to try a cocktail special called Bite The Bee's Knee and to out surprise is was perfect!! The screwdriver was on point too.  We ordered several small portions which included The hashbrown, oatmeal sweet potato pancakes and the biscuit gravy and everything was yummy!   Well done!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get.  Good food but nothing overly special about it."}
{"text":"When we found this restaurant walking around Madison, it was a Sunday and it was closing for the week. They are only open Thursday 7am - Sun 11pm. Luckily we were in town through Thursday, so we were there when they opened the doors Thursday morning. Hubby ordered the biscuits and gravy and I ordered the scramble with bacon, avocado and cheese. It was delicious!!  Definitely worth waiting in line for the few days a week they are open."}
{"text":"They only serve breakfast so if you're a breakfast lover this is YOUR place. I went on a Sunday around 12:30 pm so the line was a bit long (30-45 minute wait).  You order first and then find a table and they bring the food to you. Water, coffee, and condiments are all self-serve. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I appreciated that my server checked back on me a few times. This restaurant is located in the heart of Madison and just blocks from the state Capitol building and the UW campus. They also have a variety of alcoholic beverages, so a great brunch place indeed."}
{"text":"Is it selfish of me to wish they were open more days?  Even 2 more days?  Pretty please?  Staff is always friendly and fun, if you go on off hours (i.e. not bar time or a Sat. or Sun. from noon to 3 p.m.) the wait is non-existent. I greatly appreciate items being available in half size portions which makes me feel slightly less gluttonous.  If the bloody mary were better, I'd happily give the holy grail rating of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Madison I've had thus far. It can be pretty busy during brunch times on the weekend, so be prepared for that. Staff is usually friendly and busy, plus the food is also delicious."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Really enjoyed all the items.  Ordered a side of fruit and was pleasantly surprised by the amount and variety compared to other places.  The Pecan Streusel French toast was awesome!  The only thing missing was flavored creamer for a member of our party.  Will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Short Stack Eatery what many would say is too many times. Even when I have an opportunity to go somewhere else I still am dying to come back and eat anything at Short Stack. I kid you not, I love everything on the menu. And, their two or three coffees to select from in back (that, yes indeed, come with unlimited refills!) are always divine.  The dining area is gorgeous, the people are so friendly and the menu is just the right size to give you many options but not too many! I love Short Stack!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Short Stack twice. I hate to say it but I ate exactly the same meal twice. I just couldn't pass up an opportunity. I loved my first meal so much, I could not stray.  As many reviewers, I fell in love with the sweet potato oat pancakes. They are served with a cinnamon whipped cream that is divine. I had the short stack which was more than enough. I also had one poached egg which was cooked to perfection. Poached eggs are frequently overcooked with the yolk just a bit hard. This egg was runny but in no way undercooked.  My guy had the same thing with an egg over-easy which was also just right. His daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes which she described as fine. I do not think she has Yelping in her future. She and I had coffee which was quite good and my guy had tea. They serve Rishi brand which is excellent.  The restaurant was packed. The line moved quickly. The kitchen and wait staff were like a well-oiled machine. They moved along at a fast pace without diners feeling rushed. No easy task.   I will go back and try something new. I promise."}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting so much more out of this place, I left quite disappointed. Which makes me :(  When you arrive, you order your food at the counter and then receive a license plate with a number on it that you take to your table. I came with three other girls for brunch at around 2 PM on a Sunday. We ordered our food and sat down to wait. The table was very wobbly and when I sat down I ended up spilling coffee everywhere because it was so unstable. Not ideal to enjoy brunch with hot coffee on your lap.   I ordered a coffee (obviously), which is self serve. It was okay, but definitely tasted like it had been sitting for a while. They have self serve water too, and offer one with lemons in it. That was out though and was never refilled the entire time we were there which was a bummer.  While we were waiting a server came to our table with a short stack of blueberry pancakes....which nobody had ordered. We told her they weren't ours and she rather rudely scoffed and walked away. Then, most of our food came. They ended up making the wrong thing for one of my girlfriends and she had to wait a good 10 minutes for her plate of oatmeal sweet potato pancakes. So, 2 service blunders, a rather unpleasant waitress, and some spilled coffee is the main driver for the 3 stars.   I ordered the trio with gluten-free chocolate chip pancakes, breakfast potatoes and bacon. The pancakes were yummy, and I hadn't been able to have pancakes very often so I was excited they offered them! The bacon was also crispy and good. But the breakfast potatoes, they are heaven! Make sure to order them with cheese and onions. You will not be disappointed. I could live off of these things. Others at my table enjoyed their food as well. Only complaint I heard was that the french toast was soggy. It was also fairly expensive. Portions were as small as you get at a diner and cost you twice as much.  So, 4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service/table mishap. I will definitely give them another try, but don't think they'll become my go-to brunch stop."}
{"text":"Lively and adorable, had a late pancake breakfast during a vacation where I used to live. I'm not sure how I feel about the ordering system, but it was nice for a quick exit when there were two fussy little ones. Pancakes are obviously the star, but there are a few other options for those wanting other items. The blackberry-thyme lemonde was to die for."}
{"text":"Lots of B's to love at SSE! Brunch, breakfast all day, biscuits, bacon, bloody mary's, and more!  I tried SSE during its first two weeks of opening and was gigantically underwhelmed and unimpressed. I could have made better hash browns, pancakes, and eggs under any circumstances, but I knew to give it a few more kind go-arounds before formulating a solid review-worthy description. However, that first bloody mary was out of this world TASTY!!!  *Pats self on the head for listening to my gut*  ;)  ...Ahem...   SSE is fantastic. Despite the Mickey's-esque long, LONG lines at peak breakfast/brunch times, if you go during a weekday, or weekday evening, you'll find plenty of open seating. In fact, when I lived downtown, I ate at SSE after a number of long work day's to treat myself, and it was really nice. Cozy and delicious!  The service is pretty high for a diner-style joint and such large crowds. And the food has upgraded significantly!!! The biscuit dish is on the spicier side, but I love it. The breakfast sandwich is served on Stella's spicey cheese rolls, WHAT. Yep. Order that and die happy. I have also ordered the Blind Special on a number of occasions, and it's tasty! Rhubarb pancakes, GF veg hash, biscuit sandwich goodness. I have never heard of a missed blind special.  SSE is open Thursday - Sunday, 24/7, so go and get your late-week breakfast on, friends!"}
{"text":"First off, the lines are non-existent at 7:45am on a Saturday. This also got me out of most of the crowd at the farmers' market. I wasn't super happy about getting up earlier on the weekend than I do during the week, but it was worthwhile.   I've been here a couple times. I appreciate that the trio option exists, since I want a little bit of everything, not multiple giant plates of food. Oddly, the pancakes are the weak leg--just a little dry. The fruit bowl was also a little disappointing, with just a piece or two of four different types of fruit, only one of which was plausibly local. I am not aware of anyone growing pineapples near Madison; I am similarly skeptical about strawberries and blueberries. I would have liked some local apples and pears instead.  The breakfast potatoes are awesome. They are spiced and smashed, with lots of tasty brown. I highly recommend getting the potatoes regardless of anything else you get."}
{"text":"I love getting the blind special.  I sometimes add a short stack, only because the pan cakes are the best.  I have had several different items, by trying the blind special.  Sweet or savory it is always amazing.  The only thing I order that isn't the blind special is the Breakfast Burrito, because it is that amazing.  The buttermilk pan cakes are a perfection between fluffy, with a crisp exterior.    I wouldn't normally think greens would be a breakfast side, but it totally works.  Everything I've had has been well balanced in flavor without being bland.  Top notch without having to tip.  It's optional, when you place your order and pay.  Then find a seat and they drop off your food in a few minutes."}
{"text":"we went there for Dinner. The food is ok, but not good for dinner, sweet pancake and those stuff. Blind special is a great deal though!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything about this all day/all night breakfast place.....but the staff was so-o-o-o sad.  (More about that later.)  Great location on State  Street, a couple blocks down from the Capitol, with a minimalist interior.....yet it seemed homey. One look around and it was obvious that this was a very local, neighborhood kind of place with a great welcoming vibe. We sat at the bar and watched the food come out of the kitchen (nice size portions with photo worthy presentations), got our own coffee, and just enjoyed the buzz around us. Our orders came quickly and were classic, yummy breakfasts - Eggs Benedict for me and a couple of scrambled eggs and toast for the missus. Good flavor but wished we had shared a big stack of pancakes. Next time!  Oh, and a lot of Bloody Marys were passing in front of us and were mighty tempting. Next time!  The sad staff???  By sitting at the bar we had plenty of opportunities to chat up the young staff and everyone of them was bright, witty, and seemed genuinely interested in our having a wonderful dining experience. Kudos to the owners who have hired well.  In our chatting we told several of the staff that we were in town for a company Christmas party.    The conversation went something like this:  Me:  \"So, have you guys had your Christmas party yet?\"  Anonymous Staff ( to protect the innocent!) \"No. No party for us. As a matter of fact, there's been no mention of any kind of party.\"  Me: (with big fake sad face) \"That's just sad. I'll write a review on Yelp and mention how sad you are.\"  Anonymous Staff: \"oh, please, please do that! That would be funny!\"  Well....to the Anonymous Staff that made us want to come back again and again....  You're more than welcome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast experience! Absolutely loved the eggs benedict and i really enjoyed the coffee as well. Setup was a bit funky and the line was very long but it went fast. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Got kicked out of my table! I went to a table with my 2 yr old, 5yr old and new born while my husband ordered. A young yoga pant wearing(do people wear pants any more?) employee told me we had to wait for our order to be complete before we could sit down. I would not recommend going here with kids if they can't be nice to someone with a newborn. Someone with a screaming baby should be able to grab a table and sit down to nurse. Their rule is completely ridiculous and they should have made an exception. Go to maragold where they will not kick you out of you table with your baby."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The atmosphere is fantastic. The food is average or a bit above, but its the location, the feel, and the fact that Short Stack is open at 3am that make it a gem, in my opinion.  Short Stack makes an awesome sweet potato oatmeal pancake. Their ham serving seems skimpy for $3.50, but is also consistently tasty and has the perfect amount of \"crisp\" from the griddle."}
{"text":"2nd time here because we loved the first time! Alright, if you're an early riser, get there early, or just be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes out the door for a table! Worth the wait! You can look at the menu & decide what to have because you will have to place your order, pay, pick a table, & get your yummy beverage! Food is brought to you!   The waffles, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, & milkshakes are all very tasty! Staff are willing to make recommendations too! The environment is awesome ! Not too big, but cool decor!   All food is from local places & cooked to order! Super fresh! Mimosas & bloody Mary's were very good as well! Enjoy your meal & drinks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is made from scratch- the ingredients are top notch (and locally sourced) and you can taste it. The menu has a good balance of traditional breakfast foods for the Breakfast Purists out there, but also some funkier items like the Sweet Potato Oatmeal pancakes or the breakfast sandwich on a Stella's hot spicy cheesy roll served with rhubarb jam (the perfect sweet/savory combo). The Blind Special is also so fun, and has yet to disappoint. Highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, late night, or anything in between (they're open 24 HOURS Thurs-Sun people!)"}
{"text":"There always seems to be a line or the door and around the block on Saturday mornings but on a Thursday night about 6:30 you can walk right in. I had the small trio with potatoes, scrambled eggs, and blueberry pancakes. I also stole a bite of my husband's chocolate chip pancakes and OH MY GOSH! Everything was amazing. They carry local products and support local charities. Everything is topped off with a Ron Swanson quote about breakfast."}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs. Thurs. thru Sunday serving only breakfast. Menu changes regularly but everything is fresh and in season. Order the 'Blind Special' and you get it for half-price....as long as you don't ask what it is. If you do, then you pay the full price. Wi-Fi, out-door seating, and free large glasses of water. Hard to find a better deal late weekends that's not pizza."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place...of all time and everywhere!  Love the central location, love the cute decor (especially all the letters and envelops under the table glass, with the adorable mason jars with candy canes on them.) I liked the order process as well (sounds silly I know) but I like how you walk in and the counter to order is right there, you quick look at the menu, and you order and pay all at once.   I ended up getting a Mimosa, and the Breakfast Burrito. Both so fantastic. The Mimosa was the perfect blend of Orange Juice and Champagne...I downed it pretty fast. And the burrito was pretty good, came with Guac, sour cream, hot sauce, and your choice of Potatoes, Toast, or a tossed greens. I wish I had opted out of the potatoes, and went with the toast. Just wasn't a huge fan of them I guess.    Over all pretty great experience at Short Stack, loved how open it was, and how sweet the staff all were, and the great food as well. Trying out the breakfast sandwich or Pancakes next time though! :)"}
{"text":"I've been intrigued forever with this place & today I had a chance to try them. The line wasn't too long, but you know what would be great? If there was a stack of menus outside for the people waiting in line to peruse while they wait for a table or maybe a water station on a hot day. Most of the hold up in line this morning was due to the ordering process for parties, as there was seating open.  I had the Eggs Benedict. It wasn't life changing or anything, but it was good. I liked the side I got of the greens with sweet vinaigrette. I would get the greens again. I also liked getting as much coffee and water as I wanted from the urns against the wall next to the kitchen window that opened out to the seating area.  SSE definitely gives off a hippie vibe, with mothers breastfeed their children and a homeless guy finishing his breakfast. I found it a little too loud to linger over coffee, but some people might like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The rumors are true. The sweet potato oatmeal short stack pancakes were delicious!  A small order is more than enough! Get a side of their amazing thick cut bacon to pair with the extremely sweet cakes.   The self serve coffee is decent; staff was friendly and helpful. Loved the brightness of the space and the unique decor.   Will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Very good, great value. Blind Special is terrific.  5-stars for the Bloody Mary. It really is the world's best! Go early, best the crowd. It gets a little stuffy."}
{"text":"Famous for being a breakfast place, so I went there for a weekend brunch...  Long line out by the door since you have to order it at the counter and find your own table but the wait wasn't too bad  Food wise: it is pretty meh honestly, very plain flavors, I got the Cajun biscuits....which basically is a dull biscuit with poor texture and a spicy ground meat sauce. Nothing special about it, compare to the rest of the brunch places in madison, it is not what I would recommend.   ALSO, their bloodmary was um \"special\", it tastes like beets (probably was made out of beets too, I think) and I am not a fan of it unfortunately.   However, they do serve smaller portions and is nicely located on the nice and busy state street....serving mostly young students and out-of-towners I would say."}
{"text":"We've been to Short Stack previously and really enjoyed it. That's why when our friend was in town and wanted to go out for breakfast, we took her to Short Stack. It was a Friday morning @9:00.   They place is quirky and fun. The tables are glass w/old post-cards and envelopes under the glass. Mason jars and whisks have been refurbished into lamps and chandeliers. Great atmosphere.  We ordered at the counter and then took a seat in the window. Although busy, it was not particularly crowded and our food arrived within a reasonable time-frame. Everything looked amazing. My dining companions ordered the breakfast sandwich and a skillet and really enjoyed them. My food however was not so good. I ordered the Cajun biscuits and gravy and poached eggs. The Cajun gravy was quite tasty but the biscuit was bone-dry and rock-hard. Even using a knife it was tough sawing through the biscuit. Worse, was the poached eggs. Although very pretty, served snow white in a sundae glass, they were hard-boiled inside. I'm not talking slightly overcooked, these were hard-boiled eggs inside. Completely solid. I know poached eggs can be tricky to cook, but this was ridiculous.  So, a couple of dishes were off, not the end of the world. But the service was also really disappointing. Literally we were completely done eating and nearly ready to leave before anyone came back to our table to ask how it was. I think the only reason she came back was to clear the dishes. I mentioned the eggs and she said she'd mention it to the cooks. Since she could actually see the hard-boiled yolks left in the dish, I thought she should offer to provide new ones. She didn't and I wouldn't have taken her up on it anyway since we were already done eating, but again I felt like it would have been appropriate for her to offer. She also finally asked if I wanted a refill on my ice-tea which I did since it had been almost empty when the food first arrived. Just checking on us 20 minutes earlier would have been better.  We have had good food and service there previously. My companions enjoyed their food today, but this was a very disappointing experience for me."}
{"text":"The French toast is an out of body experience. If I lived in Madison I'd eat there every day they were open.  We go there every fall when we drive in for a Badger game.  The Bloody Mary is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I really liked my eggs benedict, which I usually order the first time going to any breakfast place. Also we sat at the bar area and I was watching the bartender make a drink with nutella in it and that saint of a woman put a HUGE scoop in there so that is definitely what I'm getting next time.  Unfortunately my boyfriend was excited by the idea of a Blind special and ordered it, which ended up being a sad bowl of blueberry oatmeal and maybe a tiny bit of fruit? (I mean, his fault for taking the risk but still, that's hardly even worth the blind price - and he was so hungry after, even with me sharing my food, that we went directly to another bar for him to get lunch). Looking through the reviews now and someone else found that same dish deterring as well. I think the chefs should just take that off the rotation - I'll bet most people are hoping for something a little more impressive than that.  Will be trying to convince him to come with me again so we can maybe have a better experience later! I'll order the blind next time... and if it's Sadness Oats again or some teeny tiny portion of something weird like other people have said... I will feel so stupid lol"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast in Madison so glad it's here! There is usually a crazy line on weekend mornings but it's worth it! The theme is so unique and somehow with all the business they keep it clean. Coffee and water is serve yourself which I think is cool as well and the coffee there is fantastic. Any dish I've ordered has also been amazing from the French toast to the blueberry pancakes and the breakfast burrito nd the portion sizes are large and satisfying. I recently tried one of their chocolate shakes as well and was sad I couldn't finish it because it was one of the best I've had but I was about to pop! You can tell they use quality chocolate in the shake. I'm getting hungry thinking about it it is a must to stop at in the downtown area!!"}
{"text":"Having visited a few times now over the past few months, I feel I can give better feedback now.  Atmosphere: absolutely adorable, clean*, and inviting -- love the old letters and postcards as table tops, in general, LOVE it! (see \"service\" below)   Food: The pancakes are rock stars!!! Seriously, these would make The Boss weep with joy! They're fabulously light and fluffy, browned to golden perfection, served piping hot and with exactly enough maple syrup (real WI maple, I believe). Delightful! WILL return (for the half portion) again, and again, and again!!! Wifey ordered the French Toast once -- amazing flavor, but she should have ordered the half and my chocolate chip pancakes came out half burnt. When Alex isn't in the back, my over-medium eggs have come out overcooked (a breakfast focused place should nail eggs perfectly every single time regardless of who is or isn't at the griddle).  Service: Let me preface with the fact that every staffer we've encountered has been positive and friendly and helpful. One morning we came in to talk business over breakfast ... we picked an empty table in the back (the table next to it, nearer a window, had dishes on it). We presumed our empty table was clean. As I placed my tablet on the table we realized there was syup in the spot -- of course -- right where I set it! The server had just cleared the dishes from the other table -- we thought she'd be quickly returning to wipe it down, but she didn't. After wiping my tablet with a napkin (placing that soiled napkin on the still dirty table next to us) wifey grabbed a bottle of cleaner and a towel. As we cleared our table and wiped it down the server approached and said \"I could do that for you\" -- we declined, she removed the dirty napkin from the other table -- but didn't wipe it down. Having been a server who bused my own tables, I think it's expected common practice that the table is wiped clean immediately following the removal of the dirty dishes. Just sayin' that's probably a bad habit to continue.  Price/value: I love all the organic ingredients and local is always a huge plus in my book, I'm always willing to pay for quality, integrity, and supporting our local economy. The full price / full size portions are balanced (you get what you pay for!) and the half size is just enough for me -- satisfied but not stuffed or feeling guilty that half the food is still on the plate! The orange juice is \"fresh squeezed\" that day, but not to order, I'd favor fresh squeezed to order ... just my opinion. ;)  Nearly five stars -- just a few tweaks to go. And a big thanks for being a place I can feel good about taking my family to eat at!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place but never got a chance. Luckily.. it wasn't so packed this morning so we gave it a try. The ambience was wonderful. The wait staff were very pleasant. The line was long but amazingly moved quite fast. We were seated in about 10 mins of wait. You order and go find a seat. It's diner style.   I think I expected a little too much from their food. We order Trio, breakfast burrito, buttermilk stack and a blind order. The blind order is half price if we don't ask what's in it. Well.. For my blind, I got scramble eggs with mushrooms and greens. I didn't like it at all. Thanks to all the other food on the table, I didn't leave hungry. Their house made potato had too much pepper in them. If u don't like black pepper- this is sure not for you. The buttermilk pancakes were good. The burrito was okay.   I would want to come again here to give it another try. Hopefully then I can change my rating from 3 stars"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"blind special\".  $10.99 if you ask what's in the special and $6.50 if you do not.  I was extremely disappointed.    The place serves breakfast food.  So I figured the special would be breakfast food.  Maybe some variation on an item actually on the menu.  Like maybe raspberry pancakes, strawberry French toast or shrimp or brisket and grits.  I was very wrong.  My \"breakfast\" today was a roast beef sandwich on a pretzel roll with a side salad and the roast beef looked and tasted store bought.    Make it breakfast at least with an over easy egg on top of the roast beef.  The only redeeming quality of the whole meal was the salad dressing.  Apparently salads (really a side of mixed greens with dressing) are common in Wisconsin with breakfast food.  I would try eating here again but I would order from the menu as many of the actual dishes look great."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast during the second \"soft opening\" weekend.  The atmosphere  is casual and cheerful though the noise level is high.  One places her order and pays the bill; a server delivers some drinks and the food.  The customer gets her own water, condiments and coffee.   The pulled pork over cheesy grits ($12:99) was served in a tin bowl with a teaspoon.  The white grits, with the consistency of cream of wheat, were not flavorful even with the cheese.  A scoop of ho-hum pulled pork was ladled over the grits, with several pickled jalapeño slices scattered on top.  The dish lacked in both presentation and taste and I would not order it again.  The fresh-squeezed orange juice, however, was delicious. My husband had blueberry pancakes.  They were served with the blueberries scattered around the pancakes rather than incorporated into them.  Served with a pat of butter and maple syrup, they were tasty.  A dinner fork would be better than the salad fork provided.  What is it with these small utensils? Service was good and everyone was friendly and upbeat.  Overall, it was average as a breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Cross this one off the list! I finally had a chance to try the new breakfast place on State Street! Aptly named Short Stack, the pancakes are where it's at! So many options, I will need to come back several times to try them all! This is a restaurant that order at the counter and claim a table. Ordering is a breeze, finding a table is not necessarily easy. Though, tables seem to open up in a timely fashion.  I LOVE their order numbers (I don't have a better name for it) - old license plates bent to display your order number! It's the little details like that, that makes this new restaurant stand out amongst the competition. I also loved the rustic light fixtures and furniture... it looked like someone did a great job at the local rummage sale. Doesn't look tacky. Works well for Short Stack Eatery."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Booze and breakfast food...what more can you ask for?    I am a fan of any place that will allow me to have chocolate chip pancakes and a cocktail.   The boyfriends breakfast burrito was fantastic, and I definitely stole my fair share of bites.    It's a really comfy and welcoming atmosphere that focuses on casual.  It's a step up from a traditional diner style place.  Yum."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place so came here with high hopes. They failed to deliver. I had the Trio with greens, eggs and potatoes. We waited about 30 minutes for our order to come out and when it did it looked like The cook had cleaned out the frying pan for my potatoes. Tiny bits of char and a few regular size pieces. The line to order was out the door. It's going to be cold in here in the winter."}
{"text":"Finally we were able to eat here. We've tried multiple times but it has been closed. There was a line outside but don't get discouraged. It goes fast. You order at a counter and grab a table. They bring it to you quickly. I got the homemade corn beef hash. Sooooo good. My daughter got scrambled eggs and breakfast potatoes. She loved it. I even liked their fresh lemonade. In looking over the menu there are many good options categorized as sweet or savory. Staff was very friendly despite it being so busy. Decor was very clever. Mixed matched chairs cool lighting.  Our table had authentic old postcards sealed in the top. Our bill was $29."}
{"text":"Incredible. All local. All homemade. Huge flavors. Grits were the best. Could've eaten a pint of the pickled jalapeños. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am not a super fan of breakfast...except when it's past midnight. With the many different options that Madison offers for late night cravings this has to be one of the best. If you don't want the horrible after feeling of Ian's and don't want anything too sweet at insomniac, this is the place to go.   Make sure you order at the counter because there isn't really table service except when they deliver the food. We tried the regular stack, chocolate chip, and blueberry pancakes. Now, let me tell you...these were one of the best pancakes ever. Granted, mix my opinion with a long night out of drinking, and i'm sure many things would be great, but i can honestly say that I will be back here during normal brunch hours to check out the rest of the menu. the line was out of the door and for a good reason.   til then, happy eating and finding!"}
{"text":"I loved this kitschy little place. Mismatched tables and chairs, unique artwork, diner-type feel all surrounding a bar. (So Wisconsin!)   When you walk in - if you can because there's always a line - you grab a menu, order and pay. They bring your food to you and clean up after. The coffee and water are self-serve.   I had the blueberry pancakes which may have been the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had. My husband had the pulled pork and cheesy grits. I think he fell in love.   Two reasons for the 4 stars:  1. After we got our food he asked for jelly for his toast and was told he could ORDER some. That seemed a little much for JELLY.  2. In every table were little vases of flowers. I love that touch. BUT. The one on our table was so dirty you couldn't see through the water. The flowers were pretty old and brown. We actually had to hide it from sight behind the table signs. Totally gross and unappealing. Made me wonder how clean anything else was..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a breakfast spot walking on State Street one Saturday morning, and noticed a short line starting to form outside this place. Hmmm... must be good food if people are lining up outside the doors, so we jumped in line, too.  When we got inside the restaurant, we figured out why there was a line... you order at the counter, 1 customer at a time, before taking a seat. They don't have wait staff to take your order at your table. Kind of weird, and not my kind of service experience, but still wanted to give it a try.  My wife ordered the Sweet Potato Oatmeal Pancakes and I ordered the Cajun Biscuits & Gravy. Observing all the food around us, we couldn't wait for our meal to show up. My wife said the pancakes were some of the best she's every had.  My Cajun Biscuits & Gravy actually came to the table cold, almost ice cold. It almost wasn't a surprise seeing that they only seemed to have 1 person delivering food to the entire restaurant. I made that person aware of the temperature issue, and she immediately took care of it. A few minutes later she brought back a piping plate. It was worth the wait - the biscuits were delicious - just the right amount of spiciness for breakfast. 5 minutes later the restaurant manager stopped by the table, very apologetic for the poor initial experience and gave me a gift card as a goodwill gesture. That wasn't necessary, as the restaurant took care of the problem right away, but still a very nice gesture - the kind that brings you back and makes you want to write a positive Yelp review.  By the time we left the restaurant, the line was 2X longer than when we arrived. Get there EARLY or be ready for a LONG wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Delicious, my daughter usually doesn't like breakfast  but she couldn't stop raving about it."}
{"text":"Lots of food for a great price. The pancakes are so sweet and delicious. If you are looking for a  fun place to grab brunch, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"I really feel like this restaurant needs a list of rules posted somewhere, so you understand that this place does not function like a typical restaurant.   First you stand in line to order at the counter. Most of the time you will end up standing outside for a while, which isn't bad unless it happens to be one of the many cold days we get in Wisconsin. While you are making decisions about what you should get you will notice a chalkboard with the beer options. Be careful what you order though because the prices are not posted on the board, and they have some pricey beers. I made the mistake of ordering an $8 Founders Breakfast Stout. It's one of my favorite beers, but no one should be paying $8 for a bottle of it. That pricing is ridiculous.  Once you've ordered your supposed to go to the back corner of the restaurant to wait for a table. There's no hostess stand or anything indicating you go there to wait for a table. I just happened to find out about it because I got talked to for having my boyfriend grab a table for us while I was ordering. Some people will just grab tables when the open though, and it's perfectly acceptable. If you happen to be one of the people who gets stuck waiting in the corner, then this would be a good time to grab water and condiments. These are found at a station near the waiting area.  The wait for our food was longer than at most restaurants, but for the right quality I won't care. I ordered the trio. I selected a short stack, bacon, and breakfast potatoes as my three items. The pancakes were all cooked to varying degrees. The top one was cooked perfectly, the middle one was over cooked, and the bottom one was burnt. Only one of them was warm enough to be able to melt any of the cold butter I was given. The bacon was sad. It was two thin pieces that were pretty fatty. The breakfast potatoes were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.   One thing to note is that if you need to get another beverage during your meal you have to go up to the counter to order it. I decided not to buy another over priced beverage that I would have to wait for. Instead I just went to the water station.  The staff that I encountered was less than impressive for the most part. Two of the three people were rude and should probably find jobs that don't involve customer service. The third individual was incredibly nice, but we only saw him when he brought out our food.  Needless to say, I have no intention of ever coming back."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. It's right off of state street and the decor brought us in. There are plants and Christmas lights hanging from the windows- cute. You order from the bar and sit wherever you want and get a bent license plate as your table number. I order the granola with almond milk and fresh fruit and it was SO good. The granola was super fresh. I ordered the small size but it was still big. My friend ordered the trio with bacon, potatoes, and fruit. Good reviews there as well. Definitely recommend it to anyone craving breakfast at any hour!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portion. Blueberry pancakes were just blah. The atmosphere is super nice. Loved the fresh flowers on the table and decor is very cool. We didnt have cocktails so we might stop back to try one of those, but not for food again."}
{"text":"I've been to SSE about 4 times now and every time I am underwhelmed. At this point, I don't know why I still bother. Anyway, the first time I went I tried the chocolate chip pancakes, a chocolate milkshake, and a side of the breakfast potatoes. Pancakes were so dry that no amount of maple syrup could recover them and the breakfast potatoes tasted about as seasoned as a white piece of printer paper. The milkshake was okay. Just vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup.  The second time I went was for the milkshake. Less chocolatey. The third time was the same: plain and bland and unbelievably overpriced for the size. Too much whipped cream!  Now the fourth AND LAST time was the one that stood out the most. I ordered a vanilla milkshake and my boyfriend ordered a chocolate. Neither of us tipped on the bill considering it was Noodles & Co.-like service. The woman did not bring water to the table nor bring food to us nor act as a waitress. I was not expecting full-service so why would I tip her like one? She demonstrated great displeasure.  The vanilla milkshake tasted like PLAIN MILK. The chocolate tasted like vanilla...and the woman behind the counter was very curt as she brought them to our table. This is not a full-service establishment. If your employees expect customers to tip like a full-service restaurant, you should probably raise their wages.  Would rather take my money to the much more expensive Marigold Kitchen. At least I know their food is worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE the hours! The food is fantastic and the blind special is a great deal. You can order it blind for 1/2 off or ask what's in it and pay full price. Personally, I like the surprise."}
{"text":"Pros: The food is bomb, the staff is nice, and the 24 hours(ish) nature of the place is absolutely wonderful.  Cons: I went in for my first time at 10pm on a Saturday, before the majority of UW students were back. Not overly busy, but my 3 pancakes still took roughly half an hour to get out to me. Also, nobody told me that water and coffee were bottomless-help-yourself style, so I went most of my meal thirsty before feeling like an idiot. Also, it was 13+ bucks for 3 pancakes and a lemonade...ouch. Finally, what's the deal with being closed for 3 whole days at a time, but open the entirety of the other 4? Seems like a staffing nightmare for management, not to mention just a weird way to run a business if you're trying to get a loyal crowd.  I'm definitely going to give this place more chances, because it's all the rage apparently, and the food was good. But I don't expect service to get quicker as UW students come back, so I'll have to plan my visits accordingly."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. You order food similar to how you would at Noodles or Culver's. Place order, take number, sit.  The first time I went I had the blueberry pancakes. These were decent, but nothing to write home about. Be careful- their syrup is very sweet and will spoil your pancakes. Real blueberries are a nice touch to the meal.  Last time, I had the breakfast burrito. Not that great. It's crammed full of beans, potatoes, and some chorizo. Not much to speak of flavor wise. You're given avocado and sour cream/salsa to choke it down. The side potatoes I ordered were half burnt- same as the first time I went (including burnt potatoes in my burrito).  Overall, it's probably better breakfast fare than most of the College population here gets normally, but it's probably not better by much. There are better ways to spend $15 on a meal."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good. Some of the workers need a bit of customer service work though or better understanding of the menu.   Went to short stack with some friends last night. I ordered the breakfast burrito which on the menu states that it comes with homemade salsa. Upon ordering the cashier asked if I wanted salsa. I said \"of course\" only to later find after looking at the receipt that they charged a dollar for the salsa. I don't mind paying extra for items not included with the order but the menu clearly stated that it was included. This is minor so I didn't say anything. The menu should say that the salsa is extra if it is though.    When the food came out I noticed that half the burrito was soaked in some kind of amber liquid. I tasted it and it was sweet and sticky. Clearly maple syrup which shouldn't be on a breakfast burrito. I took it up to the counter and asked if the burrito was supposed to come with maple syrup (who knows) they said that it was the \"oil\" that they cook the burrito in. I politely disagreed, saying the it is sweet and sticky. The waitress asked what I had ordered. In the middle of answering she just turned around and walking away with my plate without saying a thing. Kind of on the rude side. I'd understand if they had been busy but it was kind of slow.   They brought a new burrito without the \"oil\" and it tasted great. They also provided a $10 gift card to make up for it which is a nice sentiment.   Overall the food is good but the service can use a lot of improvement. They did try to make things right in the end which is amendable."}
{"text":"delicious, fast service.  The menu has a great variety of savory and sweet dishes.  I love that there's 'nothing from a box' in that restaurant.  Delicious chocolate chip pancakes, great biscuits and gravy, and great drink variety.  The bacon was good, but pricey ($4.99 for 3 slices) Good cocktails.  I wasn't as impressed with their famous bloody mary, but I am picky. the music was a little loud both times I went, but noone else in my group seemed to mind. A great feature is that they're open 24 hrs from Thursday - Sunday midnight, so it is a perfect stop any time of the day, over the weekend."}
{"text":"Four of us went for a 10:00 am brunch on Saturday. It's a great location  within walking distance to several downtown hotels. You order first at the counter and find a seat. The waitress finds you by the number painted on an old license plate. The waitstaff was very pleasant and the place had a good atmosphere and was clean.  The sand creek chocolate oatmeal stout was a great breakfast beer. The Bloody Mary is weird...not very tomato-y and has serious pulp. The skewered veggies are dyed purple from the beet juice. Someone else had the whiskey toddy but it didn't stay warm being served in a martini glass.  The eggs Benedict came with a sour cream and hot sauce bowl presumably for the hash browns. The Cajun biscuits and gravy were nontraditional and the biscuit was a little dry, but it was good. I had a side of cheesy grits which were good tasting but very lumpy texture. The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes were the big winner! Fantastic flavor, \"meaty\" texture. Marscapone on top was perfect. At first I thought I would need syrup too, but I didn't. I got the short stack of them and it was a lot of very filling food.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Short stack has blind specials which are entries which you don't know what they are. Usually they can be good, but today the blind special features Thai chilie peppers which are 50,000-100,000 scoville units. This is extraordinary hot, and we could not handle that much heat. We asked them to return it because it was way too hot for us, but they said no because it was the 'blind special'.  This seems pretty unfair because it is way too spicy and there was no warning at all. Spicy is definitely a taste preference and at a pancake House, we weren't expecting this. Sadly we have to give it a 1 star rating because of this."}
{"text":"Went here twice now, and the food is exceptional both times. My wife loves the sweet potato pancakes. That being said, the 3-star review is for a couple of things, both of which happened during our second visit.  First one, they sem to have misplaced our order. We sat on the table besides the couple who ordered right before us. Even after 20 minutes of them receiving our food, we haven't gotten ours but other orders were flying out of the kitchen. We were then told that it will be out in 5 more minutes, and our order came in pieces (ie. one dish at a time).  Secondly, the waiter who bussed our table seems to not know the basics of bussing dirty dishes. He just took my wife's plate without even asking of she was done or not (there was still food on her plate).  In conclusion, this place is pretty good. If you don't mind the long wait times, this is must-try breakfast place. We will be coming again, and maybe then I will revise my review."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito, ever. The homemade fresh guacamole was a great addition and they 3 choices of hot sauce to top it off. It was huge and very filling, was able to share with my boyfriend. The mimosa with fresh squeezed OJ was delicious, but the bloody mary did not look very appealing. I will be back and it will be difficult to order anything but the burrito."}
{"text":"I got the blind item and it was great. I have to say that the Bloody Maria is not a typical Bloody Mary. Imagine a spicy vegan slush with heavy beet flavor and vodka. I couldn't get over the fact I had to chew each sip. This wasn't for me, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"So tasty and the secret meal is a lot of fun! You can ask if it's sweet or savory, and if you have dietary restrictions you can ask if it is safe with those. During peak hours expect a bit of a wait on food though"}
{"text":"The best pancakes I've ever had. Long wait to get but definitely worth it! I recommend the chocolate chip pancakes"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for business for a couple of days. I came here the first day to try it out for breakfast and ended up returning the following morning. Food was delicious both the sweet and savory items. Coffee was excellent. The people working here are friendly. Overall the space has a great vibe to it. I would highly recommend Short Stack Eatery. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here as I was craving pancakes and I had read great reviews. It took FOREVER to get the food, it was very frustrating!! When the food finally did arrive, it was good but nothing special - I guess not worth that long a wait."}
{"text":"My go to, to-go breakfast restaurant in Madison. Eggs are always cooked to perfection. I LOVE the Eggs Benedict and the Pulled Pork and Cheesy Grits. Staff and service is phenomenal. Thank you for always serving great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Open the entire time from Thursday at 7am til Sunday at 11pm brunch spot.  Fun facts: Warning: The Bloody Mary is made with beets. It does not say this on the menu! Not my cup of tea, but I know some who would enjoy this.   You can order the blind special for half price if you don't ask what's in it. You can however ask if it is sweet or savory!   You order at the counter and then you're given a number; the food will be delivered to your table.   Condiments, coffee, and water are self service at the back of the restaurant.   Cajun biscuits and gravy as well as the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"We stopped in early on a Saturday morning and beat the crowed.   I ordered the breakfast scramble with potatoes and it was phenomenal.  Great flavors and excellent portions.   My boyfriend had the Cajun biscuits and gravy which was also a great choice.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried here. And it's open all night too. Great unique decor here and friendly staff. Order first then grab a seat.   They have a daily (sweet or savory) special. If you don't ask what it is, mystery special is 1/2 price. Great for the college crowd or adventurous diner.   Cajun B&G is delicious. The body Mary is more of a smoothie with a bunch of natural ingredients. I've never tasted a healthier one. You can get with a High Life chaser on the side. Overall really good comfort food after a long night!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is not particularly my favorite meal and I would usually rather grab a few extra winks than wake up early, try to get parking and nab a seat at a popular crowded breakfast joint. Since I was on a forced march this morning to get up early and given the strong Yelp reviews of Shortstack Eatery, I thought I would make the extra effort, fight rush-hour traffic, search for parking, and give them a go. Pretty glad I did.  As the other reviews mentioned, they source local foods and the sign says nothing comes from a box. The food truly tastes that way, too. I had the breakfast trio where you can select three items from a number of breakfast dishes - - short stack, eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats, a salad, etc. I chose the good old old-fashioned short stack, easy over eggs,  potatoes and a side of bacon (for $1.99 extra).  Pretty solid and good portions, too.  Normally I am not a pancake eater but given the name of the place, I needed to try their basic buttermilk pancakes. They were very good and served with a pat of warm butter and real maple syrup.   There is street parking out front with a lot nearby.  We were there at about 9:30 AM and found street parking about two blocks away.  They are only open Thursday through Sunday but nonstop on those days. The space is bright if not a little cramped. We found a table for three easily. They have a few big tables to handle groups of 12+. Note--I think our mobility challenged Yelp friends may have a little difficulty maneuvering about, particularly in a wheelchair.    You order at the counter and find a seat. The kind waitstaff brings your order by with a smile. All of the staff was very friendly and kind; the space, clean and well-kept.  Prices were fair for the quality and portion sizes.    All told, I pretty well enjoyed my food and experience and see why they have garnered such a following and positive Yelp reviews.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.    As for me, it wasn't so outrageously good as to merit hauling my carcass out of bed and losing out on some extra shut eye in the morning. Definitely a possibility if I was well rested and lucked out with parking and seating.  But I am a mutant.  I am sure every normal person would feel their efforts were well rewarded.  4-Yelp stars. Yelp on!"}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast...there was a lineup! I had the biscuits and gravy and scrambled egg combo...was amazing! The eggs...outstanding!  I liked it so much I can back for dinner...had the cheesy grits and pulled pork and the pecan French toast...seriously...this is very good food."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, especially the breakfast burrito! Very cute space and friendly staff.   Only hindrance- no air conditioning, but it stays pretty cool and there is also outdoor seating available.   My husband and I come here at least once a month as its a local favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food from local sources. Try the apple butter with a biscuit sometime. Place fills up quickly after 10:30-11am. Interesting mix match decor and seating. Small al la carte items can be $$. Had a few times in my experience where the staff was a bit spacey, sometimes food would arrive lukewarm, and not hot. Otherwise most of my orders were great."}
{"text":"Breakfast aficionado here.  This place has the best blueberry pancakes I've had the pleasure of eating. Perfect flavor & perfect sized portions!  Beyond that, SSE has great ambiance and really, really nice employees. I haven't gone during a busy time so I can't speak about noise being an issue. 10/10 would visit again."}
{"text":"It feels to me like they are still working out the kinks and haven't yet achieved the consistency and polish I'd expect from a place that has to charge downtown prices.  Or maybe I'm just picky lol The cook was obviously talented the day we were there, but the details of menu and layout were disappointing.  The sweet potato pancakes with bourbon maple whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries were most definitely the best breakfast dish I've possibly ever had, and my husband's hollandaise was outstanding.  I was put off by the price of sides and, in a restaurant that touts local sourcing, serving asparagus in August always seems like pretty bad form to me.  I don't mind that you order at the counter (they bring the dishes to your table), but I am sick of restaurants that charge you $2.75 to wait in line to pour your own drip coffee from one of two carafes for the whole restaurant, and $5 for three slices of overcooked, hard as rocks bacon that probably should have already come along with the pancakes anyway.  Willow Creek bacon is much better, btw. I'd rather they increase the price on all the mains by $1 and decrease the price on all the sides and drinks by $1, then I wouldn't feel so ripped off.  I'd go again some time for the pancakes, but its not going to replace our regular Sunday Original Pancake House breakfasts."}
{"text":"You know when you look at breakfast menu and you're like \"Well if I order the combo I can get toast and hashbrowns but no pancakes, but if I order the pancake potpourri then i can get hash browns and pancakes but no toast.\"  THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY! Well there is, Short Stack has trios and side orders so you can make the perfect combo.  Thumbs up to all the things we ordered:  Food: Fried Eggs, Sourdough Toast, Sweet Potato Oatmeal Pancakes, Breakfast Potatoes (diced and chunky but with a crust on the outside).    Drink: Free coffee refills.  Bloody Mary was more clean and refreshing than typical \"kitchen sink\" bloody marys. I think because there are beets in the mix."}
{"text":"First visit. The line looked daunting, but moved fairly quickly. Order at the counter and grab a seat. We had french toast, blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes and buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes were light and fluffy. Really good. The french toast was very tasty, but a bit on the sweet side. We also tried a biscuit - very good flavor and consistency - flakey - with a hint of rosemary. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great place great idea. Nothing witty to say on this one. Just some words on how it'll play out. You'll wait in line. Wrestle a seat and then chill. Enjoy some good coffee, watch interesting people, and then chow down on some AMAZING food."}
{"text":"If I lived in Madison, this place would be my haunt. I loved the nerdy atmosphere, the readily available hot sauce options, the fact that you can pick three things for a full meal (as a non-egg eater I always end up having to get a bunch of random sides for breakfast), and their pancakes were delicious. I also really LOVED their potatoes. Definitely get the cheese on them. Best breakfast I had during my week stay in WI."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried has been amazing, including the Blind Special. Friendly staff; great decor; one of our favorite places to brunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by an hour before a performance at the Overture. When we arrived, there were plenty of tables open and it is breakfast food. Shouldn't take too long to get food right? Wrong.  The menu looked OK. Limited but a lot of local ingredients. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my husband ordered the breakfast sandwich. It seemed a little overpriced for breakfast food.   After we had placed our order, we sat and waited and waited. There didn't seem to be too much coming out of the kitchen.  Watching the chefs and how much time it took them to put up a stack of pancakes was...I was stunned.  During a 10 minute period, the only thing to come to the window was a stack of pancakes which was delivered and returned by some customer.   With about 10 minutes to go before the curtain was going to go up, our food arrived. 45 minutes it look to get a burrito and breakfast sandwich. My husband ate his as fast as he could, but mine was too hot to even get one bite down. I had to bag up my food and run to make the show. When I finally did get a chance to sample my burrito, it wasn't impressed. It was flavorless and dry. No sides were offered with the burrito which was in desperate need of an acid like salsa. When I asked my husband how his sandwich was, he couldn't remember anything spectacular about it.   Short Stack is a good concept but poor in execution: overpriced, slow service and the food was meh.   If you want great breakfast food, save yourself and go to Crema Cafe or Dairyland where they know how to do an outstanding breakfast."}
{"text":"I was in Madison this past weekend for the IronMan, and when you gotta carbo load for breakfast, Short Stack Eatery seemed like a good bet. WE WERE NOT WRONG. We tried the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, the pecan french toast, and the blind special. Literally EVERYTHING is delicious. I had the full stack for the pancakes and it was a LOT of food. Next time, I'd probably get a short stack and eggs or something. But seriously, it was perfect. We tried to come again on Monday after the Ironman, but then were devastated that they're closed M/T/W. Heart breaking.   Warning: It gets MAD crowded on the weekends after around 9. Get there before 8:30 am and you will be much happier!"}
{"text":"kind of small. Get here early so you don't have to rain in a long line. Quite possibly the best biscuits and gravy I've had. Excellent pancakes too. If you are adventurous make sure to try the \"blind special\" it's half off it you don't ask what it is.  They also offer small portions of the menu items too."}
{"text":"When I was in college at UW my friends and I always felt the one thing lacking was a good breakfast place, even better if it was open late at night. Short Stack opened the year after I graduated (bad luck for me) but  is everything that campus was missing. I know that more brunch locations have opened since I left UW, but Short Stack is all I could have ever wanted in a restaurant an undergrad.   Recently I stopped by and ordered The Trio, by which I was able to easily accommodate my crazy Whole30 new year's diet. But for those of you who are not depriving yourself, I recommend the blind special every time.   In the past I have tried pancakes, bloody marys, eggs, and greens at Short Stack and have not yet been disappointed.   They have at least 4 different types of hot sauce, so you can spice up your food however floats your boat. Oh, and not to mention that the restaurant interior is precious. You can tell the owners put thought and love into all the decorations and accents. Everything is intentionally fun and oh-so-Wisconsin. You can't go wrong coming here hankering for breakfast food. Perfect weekend spot."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning when there is less of a rush.  Ambience was nice.  Seating was a little close together.  Couldn't pull my chair out without hitting the chair behind me.  All they needed to do was turn the tables.  The water is self serve.  The glasses available were wet and when drinking out of them had a noticeable dish water (soapy) flavor.  My daughter spit it back out into her glass.  Worse yet, there was no place to dump or rinse them so you basically get dish water or nothing.  The food was quite good.  Had the breakfast sandwich, which had an interesting combo of flavors.  The side I ordered was \"mixed greens\"  What I received was a spring mix lettuce like you can get in Dole bags at the store with a nice balsamic vinaigrette on it.   It tasted great, but I expected more from that.  One of the very few places on State that actually has high chairs and booster seats and is moderately kid friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about breakfast food. Until I had breakfast here. I've avoided this place since I moved here-there is always a long line and I get hangry. But last week the stars aligned and we were up early-very early so decided to jump on the opportunity to finally try this place. You order at the counter, are given a number and grab a seat. Coffee and water is self serve. Our food was out rather quickly and it did not disappoint. I had the grits and pulled pork. It was outstanding-garnished with pickled jalapeños. The small was plenty for me but those with larger appetites would probably want the regular size. My bf had the french toast. He is a lover of all things breakfast and within two bites he easily declared SSE his new favorite breakfast spot in town.   The place is laid back mixed with kooky. The staff was very friendly. Everything delivered to the tables surrounding us looked amazing. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor was very nice. Coffee was excellent and the food was good and fresh. I tried the Cajun Biscuits and Gravy but I wasn't a fan. The Biscuits wee fresh but dry for me. The fresh fruit assortment was outstanding. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes! Yum. We had the cajun biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito, and strussel. It was all fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I heard that Graze has a cult following about their corn beef hash.... For those people who follow, I present you the hash at SSE.  I got this tonight and it was amazing. While it takes a little longer, is a lot more than a typical late night snack, and is a little bit pricier, the perfectly spiced corned beef and the crunchy potatoes and the eggs layered on top was worth it.  It was almost healthy too with the side of greens :)"}
{"text":"The (blueberry) pancakes are really good. I think they have even brought me around to really enjoying pancakes.  The small trio gives you good variety AND a very reasonably sized meal.  The breakfast sandwich is also very good.  Good Sunday dinner spot, especially since it'll be crazy around, you know, breakfast."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave pancakes, and Short Stack totally gets that. I order the gluten free blueberry pancakes every time I go, and they are always so fluffy and fruity and satisfying. Their bloody mary is also something very very special. It has just the right amount of spice without overpowering the myriad other flavors, and the hint of beets makes it pretty unique. This place has a sort of hipster kitchen vibe that matches the somewhat lackadaisical serving speed, so it may not be the best option if you're hangry."}
{"text":"Years later, very consistent service and quality.   Go for the blind special, unless you have dietary restrictions.   Tends to be very busy during peak weekend brunch times, go early or go somewhere else.   Great coffee, some of the best southern gravy I have had in the north."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast near the Capital Stumbled upon Short Stack looking for a sit down restaurant that would serve early morning breakfast. The food was delicious and moderately priced. Stand in line to order and pay for your food. The line moves pretty quickly. This eclectic restaurant surprised me with its outstanding meals."}
{"text":"I really wanted to be surprised! I really really did. I even talked someone else to be surprised with me! Womp womp.   We were intrigued with the blind special so we went for it. I guess I didn't expect to have a healthy breakfast. We ended up with an omelet, salad, and melon. I guess I had my heart set on some delicious pancakes or something more hearty (aka fattening). My fiance's cousin, who's a dude, was the one I talked into ordering the blind special with me. He wasn't too thrilled. But still! The omelet was delicious. I could do without the salad and melon. I actually picked off of my fiance's meal.   He ordered the breakfast burrito and loved the chorizo. Potatoes as his side were also good--I pretty much ate most of it. My brother ordered the chocolate chip pancakes--I ate a lot of that too. Pretty much spent the time picking off of everyone else's plate.  We'd definitely come back here again, just maybe not on a Sunday morning. The wait was about an hour, to the point where we thought they forgot about us. That's what happens when you're tucked away at the back corner waiting to be seated.   But I won't lost faith in the blind special. I'll try it again next time."}
{"text":"Everything me and my wife have had here has been outstanding.  Biscuits and gravy, good. Breakfast burrito, good. Pancakes, good. Bloody Mary's, goood.  Did I mention they have a make your own Bloody Mary Bar? Really good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and delightfully local bohemian ambiance...this is exactly the kind of place you love to find for breakfast when traveling. Tables are decorated with authentic antique postcards, you order at the counter, and coffee is self serve. The crowd is a mix of college students and a variety of downtown locals. Each seat is against a window where excellent people watching provides great entertainment while you eat."}
{"text":"My table tried the sweet potato pancakes, the eggs benedict, and the breakfast sandwich.  All were super tasty.  The eggs benedict had very flaky buttery biscuits which I was a big fan of.  The breakfast sandwich came on a Stella's bun, how could you go wrong?  The bloody mary was extremely flavorful and fresh ($10).  It had a nice blend of tomato and beet juices that not only gave it a very good flavor but also a beautiful color!  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the fact that it seemed you had to do everything yourself.  Water, silverware, syrup, etc were your errand to run.  The person who delivered the food to our table asked if we needed anything and when syrup was suggested he pointed us to the other side of the restaurant... I was a little peeved by that, as it seems like the pancake order would include this.  Overall, however, I will definitely be returning for another bloody and maybe their blind special!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot with extended hours or operation for convenient late night access.  To be honest I have eaten here a few times (after bar close) but nothing has been memorable enough to outshine the company and conversation so I don't recall what I like...... so I don't have much to say here specifically!   : )"}
{"text":"Different experience but well worth the trip. Ordering when you walk in isn't that new of a concept, but it seems to work well here. Drinks were brought to our table very quickly, and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. I wasn't a huge fan of the bloody mary's, as they were more of a veggie flavored mix with lots of pickled extras, but if you don't mind that, it may be right up your alley. The menu isn't huge, but the food is really good. Great breakfast potatoes, and I heard from my friends that the pancakes were delicious. I had the scramble, and you get to choose from a selection of great fresh ingredients, and I would highly recommend it. All of those in our group were very impressed and we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Their sweet potato pancakes taste like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving Day. I recommend getting the shorter stack because the full stack it's 4 pancakes and are very filling. We also shared a strawberry milk shake and it was the best I've ever had. The decor in this restaurant is quaint and cute (take a look at their light fixtures). There is outdoor seating for the summer time, but also a lot of indoor seating as well. The line for this place is always out the door, but that's because the register (where you order) is right when you walk in. The line moves pretty fast, so don't let that deter you from going here."}
{"text":"This review is specifically directed at their Bloody Mary.  The rest of the menu is solid save for their scrambled eggs which are just above cafeteria quality (although they are at least local eggs)  They aren't shy to brag that they \"just might\" have the best bloody in the world, but now i see why they hedged that statement.  I think they just overthought the thing.  All the ingredients sound nice but it comes in a thick smoothie form that can be laborous to choke down and with so much horseradish that it literally feels like you are drinking a thickened cocktail sauce.  I've heard that east coast bloodys can have a lot of horseradish so maybe thats what they are going for.  If they had perhaps garnished it with a couple of jumbo shrimp the flavor would not have seemed so foreign.    Also, they opted to use a vodka from Texas when Death's Door distillery is right in their backyard (and is VERY GOOD).    Will go back there for their biscuits and gravy and their usually-great specials, but you could not pay me to ingest another of their bloodys.  I never write reviews for restaurants but the drink is so bad that I signed up for a yelp membership just to warn people."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. After a long break from eating at Short Stack Eats (mostly due to the long lines on the weekend and frankly better food at Marigold), a few friends and I decided to give this place another shot last weekend.   We were unfortunately unpleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant hadn't worked out their wait issue -- they now have a hostess who asks for your order number, supposedly commits it to memory and then calls it when a table is free -- and that the food was of a much worse quality than the last time we came. The hostess forgot our number, we waited ~45 min for a table (which we only got after asking about the wait and making the hostess realize that she had forgotten about us), only to wait another ~15-20 minutes for our food. When the food (eggs and a breakfast sandwich) did come, the two orders of poached eggs were hard boiled.  Short Stack clearly meets a niche need -- drunk undergrads looking for breakfast food at 3am or hungover undergrads looking for breakfast food at 11am -- but anyone looking for a good breakfast in a nice atmosphere should go to Marigold (or perhaps Merchant) instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in as this place has lots of solid reviews. Their cinnamon hazelnut coffee was a great start and something pretty unique. I ordered the Trio - you can choose three of their best items. I went with their fantastic sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, some high quality bacon and eggs. Pretty simple but everything was great especially the pancakes which come with a delicious maple bourbon mascarpone. Looking forward to a future trip to Madison so I can try their blueberry pancakes!"}
{"text":"First thing that drew my attention to this establishment was the line formed out side. Several of these patrons (myself included) had just finished the Run MadTown Half. What made me stay in line was when I learned from the other patrons that all the ingredients are locally sourced.  But it was the BACON that stole my heart...thick cut, crispy BACON ummmmmmmm BACON!!!  Pancakes, waffles, eggs, fresh squeezed OJ, it's SLAP YO MAMA good!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in the service. I sat at the bar and the food was great but no one asked me how my food was or if there was anything else I needed. This was after I prepaid a 20% tip. I will probably think twice before coming back which is disappointing because I practically live next door and could have been a regular customer. There are way too many other options around Madison with stellar customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the short stack of blueberry pancakes today.   We waited 15 minutes in line just to place our order, then we had another 20 minute wait to be seated at our table and another 15 minute wait to receive our food.   Yikes!   The short stack of blue berry pancakes was shockingly devoid of many blueberries!  I did, however, ask the wait staff for a few extra blueberries and they complied without question providing me with some fresh blueberries which I put on top of the short stack.   Enjoyed the postcards under the glass on our table, the ambience was OK - I like the idea of re-using license plates as table numbers - clever and interesting!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place. The quality of food here is good. The speed or service is fair. The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are great and go down easily. Plus this place is open late/early. It's a perfect place to stop if you've been bar hopping and just need a break. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that it's all very confusing and overwhelming inside."}
{"text":"I went with one of my friends on a Sunday morning and we were early enough that there wasn't a line out the door (8AM). Literally the second we ordered our food, the line grew about 4x longer than what it was when we got there.  This place is kind of interesting; order your food at the counter, find a place to sit, and they bring your order to your table. Menu has your pretty typical breakfast fare but some of the items have a fun twist. They also have a 'blind special' which you can order for pretty cheap granted you are ordering blind (they will tell you if it's sweet or savory though). The day we went it was a sweet item and I am usually not a fan of sweet breakfast items so I ordered the cajun biscuits and gravy and a blueberry mint lemonade.   A lot of the reviews said that the wait for your can be long, but I felt like our wait was pretty average. Average wait for pretty average food. I thought the biscuits were decent -- nice and moist and not too dense. The gravy was just eh, and eggs are just eggs so not much to say there. Overall it wasn't bad, but there was nothing exceptional about it either. Maybe I should have ordered something else? I will say the lemonade was good, if not a bit pricey. My friend ordered a strawberry basil lemonade and I thought that was good as well.  Overall? Just okay. There is a lot of hype around this place but overall I don't think it really lived up to the hype. Open 24 hours a day on weekends -- in theory it seems like a cool idea, in execution not so much. Uncomfortably crowded, a bit over-priced for a place that doesn't have table service (except when they bring your food to you), and the food was just fine.   Would I come back? Part of me says yes just to check out more of the menu, but only if there's not a huge line and it's not ridiculously hot or cold outside either."}
{"text":"Don't get discouraged by the line - it moves fast. Usually go with the $7 blind special, but wasn't feeling risky this time.   Underneath these two eggs is a MOUNTAIN of corned beef hash. Mostly beef and a few potatoes, but I'm not complaining. Pancakes are a solid pick as well."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on a Friday and had an excellent meal.  Very friendly service and the Cajun biscuits & gravy was great.  The order was huge so heal fonder would be fine for most.  My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes and said they were some of the best.  Excellent quality and value."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things I like about this place-- vintagey turquoise walls, tabletops decorated with assorted antique letters, etc. Granted, a lot of the cool parts of this place lie in a somewhat formulaic \"trendy places\" formula, but I can't say I mind.   What I can say is that the sweet potato pancakes are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! And huge. Definitely huge. They come covered in strawberries and accompanied by some kind of cinnamony whipped-cream magic that melts in your mouth and adds to the already fantastic flavors. There are layers upon layers of cinnamon, nutmeg, cool whipped cream, fresh strawberry, and of course sweet potato flavors. SOOO GOOD!  My biggest complaint about this place is what seems to be its constant temperature--HOT! I stopped in once while it was still relatively cold inside, and the searing heat inside was an extremely uncomfortable temperature when paired with my winter coat and sweater. The heat hit me almost instantly, so I know staying longer would have been equally uncomfortable. Summer is no different, either. Short Stack doesn't have any air conditioning, so you have to sort of drink lots of water and try hard not to move to compensate for that.   Overall, I'd return. The crazy lines that started upon opening seem to have died down, so this is a much more accessible place than at first."}
{"text":"We tried the breakfast sandwich and the scramble. The rhubarb jam and caramelized onions made the breakfast sandwich a little more unique than the standard breakfast sandwich. The scramble was as expected, scrambled eggs with choice of three additional ingredients. The side potatoes have a fair amount of rosemary and are pretty oily. I would probably try the mixed greens next time. I wanted to like the Bloody Mary but it was very thick and tasted a bit too much like vinegar. They have several other cocktails so next time I would just try something different. It's a cute place. The staff was very friendly and moved the crowd quickly. We will return but probably try different drinks and food choices."}
{"text":"I sincerely enjoyed the pancakes that were today's surprise special. On their own they were great but the chocolate cherry almond topping knocked it out of the park.  Excellent coffee too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Blind Special and got a surprisingly delicious plate of savory salads and caramelized roasted sweet potatoes+carrots!   The ambience of this place is awesome, the greasy smell kinda follows you back home, but we really like this place! ps: don't leave out the bloody!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We had the sweet potato pancakes, breakfast sandwich on Stella's spicy cheese roll (must try!) and eggs Benedict! The line was long and out the door, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The service is super unpredictable but if you know that coming in you will have a good time! Never had a bad meal here. I love the idea of the blind special but am rarely brave enough to get in. One time it was peanut butter jelly pancakes and it was the most incredible pancake I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love absolutely everything that I have eaten here but I am especially in love with the breakfast sandwich. The spicy cheese bread roll and the rhubarb jam make it one of the best I've eaten."}
{"text":"I really *want* to be super amped about Short Stack, but I have honestly yet to be wowed by them. I've tried their Sweet Potato Oatmeal stack on multiple occasions, but I've never been happy with them :( They seem undercooked and insubstantial every time. Maybe next time I'll ask them to try to OVERcook them. Will report back soon!   Meanwhile, I'm a fan of their mimosas, but they are: wayyy to expensive. I would order multiple mimosas in one sitting if they weren't $7 each. I'd say go for the Bloody Mary instead. It's apparently an award winning item, and you can sip on it for the duration of your dining experience.   Lastly, I'd say be very careful about what time you attempt to venture into this establishment- the lines can be outrageously long. Maybe try calling ahead of time :)   I hope y'all have a great time there- it's honestly such a cute place!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch this morning, and there was one dish that blew me away - the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes were to die for.  The maple-bourbon mascarpone was a beautiful complement to the spiced pancakes.  It was like having carrot cake for breakfast, but not quite as sweet.    Short Stack is all about restraint in their food, which works perfectly well with their sweeter breakfast dishes like their pancakes, but not so well with the savoury dishes.  I also ordered a small order of eggs benedict which I was not happy with.  The potatoes that came on the side were tasteless and bland.  They hadn't even bothered to salt the potatoes, though the sour cream and hot sauce they provided helped it out.  The hollandaise was mediocre and the egg on top wasn't poached but done over easy.  They use a biscuit rather than an english muffin for their eggs benedict and I found the ratio of ham to biscuit to hollandaise to egg yolk all off.  A good eggs benedict is balanced.    I also ordered their bloody mary.  I ordered the lil version which was regular sized while my friend ordered their regular version which was enormous sized.  Neither of us were a fan of the bloody mary.  We both found it thick like tomato soup and heavy on the garlic.  Really, we both felt like we were drinking cocktail sauce without the shrimp.  Neither of us finished our bloody marys.    Come here for the amazing pancakes."}
{"text":"This place always has a line out the door and sometimes down the block, which is a testimony to how great they are. If you order the blind special, it is half priced. Otherwise there is a great selection of breakfast items, both sweet and savory. I usually get a pretty traditional 2 egg breakfast with potatoes, but their potatoes are great and very well seasoned. Their mimosas should not be overlooked either- especially the pear mimosa. My only negative comment on Short Stack is that they are pretty overpriced even considering the location- breakfast food is very inexpensive to make and they significantly upcharge. They are only open Thursday- Sunday, but the entire time (this is great for a post bar 3am meal for all of you college students)."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good (though a little pricey) - I recommend the french toast - but the overall experience left much to be desired. When you first arrive, you have to wait in line to order. Once you order, you get put on the list to be seated. The bar is part of the seating that you have to wait for, and there isn't really much room for waiting parties, so while you wait you have to awkwardly stand between tables where people are eating. Coffee is self serve so you have to continue to move out of both waiters' and guests' way. Of course you already paid for your food so you can't leave if you're sick of waiting. When you are finally seated, there are people standing all around your table, waiting to be seated themselves. We were told the food would be another half hour. At least we didn't have to wait on anyone to refill our coffee I guess. Food was good but I'm not sure if it's worth all that. If we could have just walked around State Street while waiting for our table, that would have been much better."}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes. I got the \"trio\" with sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, eggs, and sausage. I didn't know such a combination of pancake ingredients existed, but it was really good. It came with some kind of cinnamon mascarpone fluffy sauce too. The restaurant is an order-at-the-front kind of place, which I don't love... But other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"Delicious and well-priced breakfast  spot.  Small tables and self-seating make for a casual atmosphere.  Sweet potato pancakes are excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday and had a great bloody mary and cheesy grits with BBQ pork. The atmosphere is very cool with a ton of personal touches. Highly recommend this spot at any time of day. (they're open 24 hours all weekend!)"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything here. The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, breakfast burrito and Cajun biscuits n gravy are unreal - get you some"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here in August during the CrossFit Games one morning before heading to the Allient Energy Center. We arrived at 8am, had a short 15 minute wait in line, ordered and grabbed seats right away. You order at the counter, pay, take a number and pick a seat. Coffee and water were self serve after that.  The coffee was PHENOMENAL. I have pretty high standards; must be hot, must be bold, and keep it coming! I loved the self serve station and the local Wisconsin brew. SSE offered a special menu item featuring Paleo ingredients and egg whites for CrossFitters attending the CrossFit games. It was delicious, wholesome, and definitely cooked to order. Because I wanted to try something SSE authentic I also ordered a short stack of their Sweet Potato Oatmeal Pancakes. Next time I'm getting the full size version! I'll never be able to eat regular pancakes again. They were so fluffy and flavorful that they hardly needed any syrup.  HUGE SSE fans. Loved the decor and the atmosphere. Thank you for being fabulous hosts to this CrossFitting crew."}
{"text":"Had sweet potato pancake and the blind, some kind of oatmeal custard thing... Neither was terrible, but not good either. The sweet potato pancake is overloaded with cinnamon and I couldn't taste the sweet potato at all. One of the pancakes is also burnt.. The blind was totally not worth the full price, since it was made from cheap ingredients. Rishi tea is also forgettable, it is pretty much tasteless overall. Jeez I know tea is not a big thing here, but at least try to get it right?"}
{"text":"This was a really cool place, cool concept. Instead of a normal \"waitress\" type service, you enter and get in line and place your order. They seat you. You get your own coffee. Then they will bring the food out! All homemade, delicious quality breakfast items. I love the nostalgia and letters in the glass tables Curious to know if these were part of the owner's family or collectibles they picked up along the way. Either way, a very cute place with great food and good service (and I always adore a quality cup of joe!)"}
{"text":"My birthday breakfast was amazing here! We sat near the cool open kitchen in this casually hip and funky restaurant, with a great view of all the goings on. I tried the Blind Special, which is perfect for someone like me who can never make up her mind -- it turned out to be a delicious bacon and tomato omelet with fontina cheese, served with their breakfast potatoes and that smoky hot sauce and sour cream stuff that I wanted to drink right out of its little ramekin. I had a banana shake, too and it was AWESOME. My family was nice enough to let me try their various pancakes and they were also AWESOME, with fresh maple syrup. They have fresh squeezed juices, too! Short Stack Eatery rocked my world this morning. Just really really good. The walk up and order, then find a table thing was a little stressful for us with a wheelchair, and they don't do rezzies, but it turned out totally fine. Can't wait to try it again.."}
{"text":"This place is ok.. The place is hip looking but the food is ok.. We ordered the eggs Benedict that was ok the hollandaise sauce is a little bland. We also ordered the blind spot.... It's like pancakes with baby food not so good combination."}
{"text":"Make your own scramble!! My personal favorite is pepper jack cheese, chorizo, pepper and onion. Their pancakes are delicious. My boyfriend got the Cajun biscuits and gravy and absolutely loved them. I think when I looked away he started licking the plate. Their cocktails are different but nonetheless good. I didn't love the Bloody Mary--it is made with beets and the stick of food on top isn't great either. The pumpkin cider (beer) was really good and so are all the cocktails I've tried (except the Bloody Mary). Overall short stack eateries food is definitely worth it and they are open late on weekends. They can get pretty busy, but you pay before hand then have food delivered (like noodles and company). I definitely recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Instead of eating on the outskirts of Madison, ventured into the down town area.  Had breakfast at Short Stacks.  What a refreshing change of pace for us.  Great breakfast, efficient service and a down to earth menu.  The sweet potato pancakes are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Their sweet potato pancakes are unbelievable. They contain huge chunks of sweet potatoes, are perfectly spiced, and are accompanied by delicious, sweet marscapone. Get a short stack; it will still be too much food.  I've tried a few other things, but have not been wowed by anything other than the sweet potato pancakes and the bloody marys. Still, the line of people waiting in the cold to order food every weekend can't be wrong; it's a great place."}
{"text":"Number one sweet potato oatmeal pancakes! They come with a creamy but slighty cheesy spread, cut up strawberries, and syrup. But be careful because these pancakes are extremely filling. I made the mistake once of eating the entire plate and was sick for the entire rest of the day. So pace yourself when you eat here!  Another thing I like about this place is their \"Blind Special\", which is only $7 if you don't ask what it is or $11 if you do ask what it is. Although you won't know what it is, you're allowed to ask if it is savory or sweet! So if it fits my taste buds that day, I usually always go with the Blind, because it has never let me down!   Oh, and cool vibes!"}
{"text":"IHOP has better quality food. This is a over rated new restaurant downtown that is confusing and unorganized. You pay first but also tip in the beginning which doesn't make sense. It's self service but the way they take orders seems like it'd be a quick thing. Especially breakfast food but our food was burnt and took awhile when the place was empty. I would only go again if I was drunk."}
{"text":"The line coming out the front door can be intimidating, but the wait isn't long (it's the line to order, not for a table, those are catch-as-catch-can). I had the Cajun biscuits & gravy, and my wife had blueberry pancakes. The B&G's were spicy and very rich, a nice variation on an old favorite. The pancakes are cooked in BUTTER and served with real maple syrup (which isn't everyone's favorite) and were amazing. The food arrived reasonably quickly given the fact the place was crowded. The prices are higher than some of my other favorite breakfast spots, but the food is a good value."}
{"text":"We came here with a gift card, and used the whole card in one sitting! I had the breakfast sandwich (on a Stella spicy cheese roll....yum!!!!) and my husband had the sweet potato pancakes. We both left feeling a little too full but fully satisfied. The place was reasonably clean, and we were in and out within an hour which was nice for a workday brunch. If we lived within walking, or even biking, distance we would be back for sure! The limited parking options and hours make it tough to return though when you have to drive in from the suburbs."}
{"text":"Really solid 24-hour brunchery! My favorite is the breakfast burrito or the scramble, but you can always do the blind special to pay half price (but do that at your own risk), sometimes it's not exactly what you're in the mood for, but it probably will still be delicious.   Oh and try their bloody! Apparently there is beets in it and I'm a sucker for some beet juice."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had...definitely highly recommend. Love that it is open all hours on the weekend."}
{"text":"I LOVE Short Stack. This is my favorite breakfast place in Madison. I've tried their chocolate chip pancakes, sweet potato pancakes, breakfast burrito, and french toast. I have loved everything I've tried!!! Besides their awesome food, they do great things for the community as well. If you're thinking of going here, you definitely should!"}
{"text":"An indie restaurant with a focus on organic and sustainable food (but, hey this is Madison after all, what do you expect?), serving breakfast early-beginning at 7 am daily.  We stopped in just after they opened on a Sunday morning in August for a meal before hitting the road back to Minneapolis.  The place is small but serves up some hearty chow.  I ordered the French Toast which was dipped in a thick batter and served with a good helping of blueberries and strawberries and two big scoops of whipped cream.  It was a rich treat for breakfast.  My son had a large egg sandwich with thick crispy bacon on sour dough bread.  We both had fresh orange juice too.  A couple of things to remember - order at the counter straight ahead of you as you enter.  They will give you a number (bent car license plate) and bring your food too you.  If you want water, help your self from the larger cooler in the back.  Parking - hopefully you can find street parking or better yet, just walk there.  They are located on the corner of Johnson St and State St.  The only negative for me was the price.  Our breakfast was almost $30 for the egg sandwich, french toast and two OJ (1 lg, 1 sm) - pretty pricey.  Nonetheless, the food is high quality and tasty."}
{"text":"Short Stack has been at the top of my list on the sticky note I keep of \"restaurants to visit\" to reference when I need some guidance. I appreciate their unique concept of running 24/7 from Thursday-Sunday though I've only visited during traditional dining hours.   The breakfast sandwich was one of the best I have tried in the city. It was a bit sloppy - fried cheese stuck to the bottom of my spicy cheese roll though I let that go. The savory and sweet of the flavors is amazing. The breakfast potatoes come with an option to add cheese and onions (smothered and covered for the Waffle House fans) - they were definitely worth the extra caloric intake!  Another friend ordered the blind special - such a brave choice! He ended up with a pulled pork hash with an overeasy egg. (hint: we realized you can find out what the blind special is by casually walking past the pickup window - the special is taped to the counter for servers' reference) The blind special was a disappointingly small portion. It leaves one to wonder if the blind special \"deal\" leads to a smaller portion size.   Lastly, the wait gets super long in the prime brunch hours. We arrived at 9am to a half-full restaurant and it was worth the \"early\" wake-up to beat the long line that formed less than an hour later."}
{"text":"In terms of the overall proximity to campus and food quality, short stack serves its purpose for most brunch happy college students. The vintage-quaint chicness of the decor makes it a lovely place to brunch with girlfriends.  The food in itself is farm de table...from what I remember. When I visited, I ordered chocolate pancakes and  the breakfast burrito as well as a large Bloody Mary. If you're looking for a blast of flavor and lots to eat, the breakfast burrito is where it's at. The only thing is that guac and salsa is a dollar extra. The Bloody Mary is their own mix of fresh tomato purée accompanied by some pickles and celery. I wish they could make it a bit spicier, so next time I will ask for hot sauce.  I gave this review 4 stars because short stack needs to address their seating capacity issue. When I walk past short stack, there's usually a line out the door, which is unappealing during the winter season. This is usually due to the fact that most people will sit, eat, and lounge for a long time. Short stack should establish a max seating time so that incoming customers can have seating.   In the past, I've gone early and ordered for my friends so that we could find seating in time. This worked out pretty well.  Overall-a great centrally located brunch joint with a fresh selection. Just avoid the rush;)!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived: There are plenty of signs c this should be a nice place... Local products, local owners. But. Expensive and poorly prepared food. Eggs were child & tasteless, bacon over cooked & tasteless, cakes were decent. Ambiance good. Coffee good. For a $17 breakfast it was lacking quality."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place . Tried their blind special. Was pretty good. Recommend trying their pancakes too. Yummy mimosa and bloody Mary as well. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once in the morning and once late at night.   PROS:  -food is AMAZING. I tried a bit of everyone at my table's dishes, everything from mac n cheese to pancakes to eggs benedict, and loved it all.  -side of greens instead of your regular soggy fruit or salty potatoes is FABULOUS! -get the blind special...you won't regret it  -the decor is cute--I love the postcards under the glass on the tables, fun to read as you wait for your food  CONS:  -Service is a little spotty and slow, but it's a new business, so I understand it can take a bit for those things to get streamlined  -the cocktails are really complicated (I realise this sounds like a stupid complaint but I don't want to have to read a drink description six times to decide if I'll like it) and overpriced for Madison; also quite weak, I couldn't taste the liquor in my drink at all  -and the real kicker...the place is not air conditioned, and it's usually hot as hell inside. It was okay when I went at night and the place was empty, but when I came back during packed brunch hour, it was a nightmare--at least 85 degrees inside. Such a bummer! Hope they install AC or at least some fans asap.  But they're a new business, so 4 stars for them! I'm sure they'll work out the kinks soon. I will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast place! Had the breakfast sandwich and cheesy potatoes, which were excellent. Love the Bloody Mary bar and the overall feel of the place, casual and friendly. Can't believe nobody thought of opening a cool restaurant like this serving late night breakfast close to campus when I went to school here."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and I enjoyed both my experiences here. First time, I came here for brunch and had the half order of eggs benedict. For the price of $5.99, you get one biscuit, slice of meat, and a poached egg. Pretty delicious. I also had the famous bloody mary. I didn't think it's the best I've had, but it was pretty good! A little too many ingredients in the drink, and it felt \"busy\" (I felt like I was drinking a meal). Brunch time was also pretty packed with people, so it took me quite a long time to receive my food. It wasn't a bad experience, but I enjoyed coming here for dinner much more.  I came here this past weekend for dinner, and I loved it. I ordered the two eggs sunny side up, side of short stack pancakes, and the blueberry tea, and my food (and all seven other people's food I was with) took around 10 minutes. Wow, those pancakes are amazing. I had a couple bites of my friend's sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, and I was in love. And my other friend's chocolate chip pancakes... I cannot wait to come back for a pancake lunch. Just pancakes with pancakes. I didn't enjoy the tea as much. It kind of tasted like blueberry water, so I drowned it in honey and lemon to make it taste better.  Three of my friends ordered the breakfast burrito, and none of them finished it; not because it wasn't good, but because the meal was ginormous! A huge burrito with a giant side of hash browns. I couldn't believe how big it was. And my boyfriend told me that mixing it with the siraicha sour cream made it hard to stop eating.  Environment is very cute. You have to get up to get your own water, but I actually really like that because then I don't have to wait around for it. I had a great time here with my friends, and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Short Stack definitely lived up to its reputation on my first visit! The service, food and libations were top notch! Definitely a must have if you are visiting Madison."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that has good food and service then look no further. You're probably thinking it's just breakfast food, but this place prepares it perfectly. Eggs cooked perfectly. Hash browns cooked perfectly. Even the toast is cooked perfectly.   Add to this,  the food service absolutely spot on. The staff is courteous, polite and responsive.   Just when you think it can't get any better, they hit you with the apple butter. The apple butter  pairs well with her fluffy pancakes. If butter is so good it goes well on everything.  If you're in the Madison area, you must check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Super busy, but not a long wait. They have sweet and savory options- all good. State street had been missing this place for too long."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place lives up to the hype. Arguably the best restaurant experience I had in Madison. We didn't even need to wait for a table... And on Memorial Day weekend! The environment is a little loud, but super cute and modern with lots of natural light. We got iced coffees which were not cold brewed but were high quality coffee (I wouldn't have known the difference but my boyfriend is a coffee connoisseur). The pancakes are light and fluffy and have a uniquely delicious flavor I can't put my finger on. I have no idea what they do to them but wow. The breakfast potatoes are some of the best I've had anywhere. My boo had the breakfast burrito and reported that it was \"above average.\" Do yourself a favor and come here!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food but too expensive. I was unimpressed with the staff too. Order taker was so slow: most tables empty but a line out the door. Waitress asking us if we wanted her to take away our plates while we were still eating.  Etc."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good location, interpretive line situation, hilarious store hours....  Let's start with the food. What I tried: The Blind Special- this time, it was bread pudding french toast with fruit compote. In a word, delicious. In more words, a fantastic surprise. Live a little and just try the blind special because it is fun to not know what you are getting yourself into but in a very safe and controlled environment.   Breakfast Sandwich on a STEEELLLAAAA cheese bun- I don't even think that needs a follow up. It was delicious, just order it  Now let's talk about the line- while you are in line, you will begin to wonder where you are going to sit. Because all the tables are full and there are more people in front of you. They are experiencing the same panic sweat that you are. Don't worry, because it will all magically work out. If there is not a table immediately available after you order, you take a number and hang out on the couch in the back. NBD.  Honesty, the hours are just funny. Amirite? 7AM Thursday to 11PM Sunday. And they know it too because they say \"88 Hours Straight\" on their website."}
{"text":"good food except for this one time i ordered the blind special and it was a waffle with powdered sugar on it.  the cashier charged me 12 dollars too...for a waffle? nopeeeeee"}
{"text":"The line out the door in single digit weather was the worst part but it was worth it. The food was great.  Highly recommend the breakfast burrito.  We had to get our own coffee and table.  Which was inconvenient when there's a huge table ready but there's only two of us.  No parking."}
{"text":"Every morning I've walked by this place there has been a line out the door. I've heard it's amazing.. serving only breakfast food and only open certain days of the week. It was definitely worth the wait in my opinion. I waited in line for about 45 minutes and then ordered at the host stand. Which is an interesting set up.. you order all your food and drinks at the host stand and then seat yourself and they bring it to you when it's ready. A unique menu item is called \"the blind\" which is a compilation of three random menu items for $7.. if you ask what it is you pay $11. I was feeling adventurous so I went with it without asking. I also got a large Bloody Mary because they had signs everywhere saying it was one of the best in town. 27 ingredients. The food was AMAZING. I got a veggie scramble with goat cheese.. included Brussels sprouts, onions, multi colored potatoes, etc and then came with a field green salad tossed in balsamic with pickled red onions and radishes.. and two fried eggs. I loved it. The Bloody Mary was a little too much. The mix was SUPER thick.. if I drank the whole thing I would've exploded from fullness. The flavors were great but I would recommend a small one if you're eating then go from there. My friend got the blueberry pancakes and breakfast potatoes and they were maybe some of the best pancakes I've tasted. All in all it was a great experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incredible food and a great atmosphere! I just wish they had a little bit bigger of a menu for more food options."}
{"text":"Short Stack is a place I've been meaning to try for years, but the combo of their specialized hours + lines out the door just haven't jived with my attempts to stop in. I finally had my chance on a Friday summer evening and had a good experience that is probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4.   The night we stopped in their air conditioning was broken, but it was a pretty mild night and they had plenty of fans going. Once you got out of the doorway it wasn't bad at all, temperature-wise. The fans were caked in dust, though, so I wish they'd have wiped them down before turning them on. I couldn't help but imagining what would be blowing onto my food as I sat there.   While I have been yearning to try their sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, my stomach was telling me to go a more savory route for dinner. I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered the breakfast sandwich, sans egg. The combo of soft Stella's spicy cheese bread, crispy bacon, tomato, cheddar, and onions* was very satisfying. It also came with almost a quarter of a cup of rhubarb jam on it - for me it was overkill. Not too bad after scraping 90% of it off, but I think in the future I'll order it on the side.  *The menu says caramelized onions, which would have been incredible, but like so many places they were actually closer to grilled. I wish places would agree that to be caramelized the onion has to be brown (preferably dark brown) and softened. Anyway, onion rant over.   The breakfast potatoes looked amazing but had no flavor. My meal came with a little tin of sour cream and a sweet & spicy hot sauce - dunking my bites of potato into that helped, but I wish they'd been seasoned on their own.   It took awhile for our food to come out (a table of four that came in after us got their food before my dinner buddy and I did), but at least the food was hot and our order was correct.   I do need to get back to try the pancakes, but I'm not champing at the bit to do so. A solid option, but I don't think I'd wait in line for it."}
{"text":"Awesome beautiful waffles. It was very delicious! Totally recommend it. The buttermilk waffles are really something to try!"}
{"text":"You have to be prepared to wait in line to eat at the Short Stack Eatery!  We waited in line for probably 40 minutes.  As you approach the door, you realize that you order at the hostess stand and then find a table on your own.  Once we were seated, we enjoyed our Bloody Mary drinks, which were quite different than what we expected.  The food was worth the wait and we enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow. I was amazed by this place. A thoughtful menu that feels as though each and every dish had an intense amount of care and consideration for each ingredient. The bloody mary's were truly refreshing-- not just your typical ingredients with some spice and too much garnish to make it seem fancy-- these are obviously deliberately balanced, refreshing, and new. Big fan. Then, we went with a couple crowd favorites, the oatmeal sweet potato pancakes, and the breakfast burrito. Both were some of the best breakfast food I've had in a long time. I've truly never had anything like the pancakes before. The burrito embodied pretty much everything I could like about that kind of dish.  Okay, to try and slow down a little bit from the overwhelmingly positive review: I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of their backwards ordering system. While the order-and-pay-first-then-grab-a-seat method might work for somewhere like a sandwich shop, it doesnt seem very good for a sit down brunch place. As soon as we finished paying and sat down, I realized I wanted coffee. Now I'm staring at a line of 15 people and deciding to just go without it; at a traditional wait-staff served place, that would have been no problem.  But overall, a small price to pay for some of the best breakfast food in town."}
{"text":"Arrive early, this place fills up quick. Love the different styles of pancakes. My favorites are always blueberry. They do creative  brunch cocktails and great chai lattes too"}
{"text":"If you come to Short Stack for breakfast on a weekend, you're almost guaranteed an out-the-door line to wait in. It's worth it though.   This charming, unpretentious space is a go-to spot for Madison residents and students alike...for good reason. Great breakfast cocktails, fluffy pancakes, and delicious savory breakfast options.  As someone who prefers savory over sweet in terms of breakfast, I've mostly chosen the savory options, and I have liked everything I've tried.   The Breakfast Sandwich is delicious + comes on a spicy cheese roll which always brings back the best Farmer's Market nostalgia, even in the winter. The Eggs Benedict is also a classic...the lemon hollandaise sauce is delicious. My favorite, though, is the Pork and Grits. The grits are smooth and creamy, while the pork is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. Such a good dish.  You really can't go wrong here, and you'll probably soon find yourself coming here for brunch as well as breakfast for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Short Stack has a great location and I think that it's model of open 24h thurs-sun is pretty cool. The tables and chairs are cute and food came out fairly quickly. The chocolate milkshake was stellar. It was my first time so I did the \"blind special\" where you can order the special at half price without knowing what it is. I'm usually risk-averse but why not. You're allowed to ask if The dish is sweet or savory, and also ask if there are particular allergens. Mine ended up being a ham quesadilla. I would've like to know if it was a breakfast food or not, since it is a breakfast eatery. Regardless, my companion and I both got dishes that were full of caramelized onions. Additionally, I got a stack of blueberry pancakes which were good but you'd think that a place that specialized in pancakes would have better butter instead of just the basic pre-packaged patty."}
{"text":"I don't come here a lot because it is always packed, but I had a free Thursday recently so I decided to come in and bring my laptop to do some work. I had the BEST time. During \"off\" hours, this place is less like a campus hangout and more like the local diner. My fellow patrons were mostly (what looked like) retirees in to drink coffee, eat food, and read the paper. The atmosphere was so pleasant and homey. Also, this place probably has my favorite coffee in town (bottomless and self-serve).  But of course, what really matters is the food! I got a \"small order\" of the cajun biscuits and gravy with an over-easy egg. Delicious. The gravy, which the menu called \"spicy,\" was not so much spicy as just flavorful, which was perfect for me. It went perfectly with my runny egg yolk and I wanted to lick the sauce right off the plate when I was done. The biscuit was fluffy and full of buttery flavor goodness.  Overall, the menu gives you a lot of ways to do breakfast according to the way you want to do breakfast. It has the staples (egg-meat-potato combo, pancakes, waffles), and the funkier stuff (such as the cajun gravy), and the blind special for the truly adventurous. I LOVE that they have \"small orders\" so I can pay for the amount of food that I actually want to eat, not attempt to eat a huge plate because I'm not trying to box up biscuits and gravy and then walking out feeling like a roll of butter.  As many thumbs as possible up!"}
{"text":"Short Stack Eatery is open four days a week.  Every other restaurant on State Street is open at least six days a week.  How do they manage this? Easy: they jack up the prices.  I ordered: eggs sunny side up, sourdough toast, potatoes, sausage, pancakes (yes, it was a big breakfast!), a bloody mary  My wife ordered: a breakfast burrito and a mimosa.  The total came to... over $45.  That's right: $45 for breakfast.  That's insane.  I might be ok with paying that price for the best breakfast I've ever had.  That's not what I got.  The good: pancakes-- truly excellent.  Fluffy, flavorful, and served with a high quality maple syrup  sourdough toast-- delicious!  The fine: - eggs were cooked just fine.  It's not like you can make brilliant sunny side up eggs.  You either make them right or screw them up.  They didn't screw them up.  The not fine: - The sausage links tasted fine, but they were TINY.  I've seen breakfast places serve links this size, but they've always come four to an order.  At Short Stack you get two.  Pathetic.  - Potatoes: Absolutely flavorless  - Breakfast burrito: delicious on the first bite.  Mushy and salty after that.  The absolutely disgusting - Bloody Mary: I love this drink, but this was by far the worst, most repulsive variation I have ever tasted.  It was pulpy, thick, and disgusting.  It came with an elaborate garnish that contained absolutely nothing that I actually wanted to eat.  And it somehow inexplicably costs ten dollars.  Seriously?Just thinking of this drink is making me gag.   The WTF?  - it was about 90 degrees inside, so we ended up sitting outside in late October.  - The waitress brought the food and drinks.  I asked for tobasco sauce to kill the nastiness of the bloody.  She told me to go inside to the self service bar.  Are you kidding me? Did I just not pay $45 friggin' dollars for breakfast? How about you grab the goddamn bottle of Tobasco sauce and bring it to me?  Why does this location seem to attract total amateurs who don't have a clue about running a restaurant?  First T Sushi and now this bullshit."}
{"text":"So glad there is a restaurant that is open 24 hrs, even just for the weekend. They also serve a killer bloody Mary that boasts 25 ingredients. They have all their breakfast bases covered; both sweet and savory. Pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, etc. The blind special is a fun idea. You pay 1/2 price if you don't ask what it is, and full price if you do. When I went on Sunday, it was a chorizo/spinach/cheese/tomato omelet with potato hash that had either rosemary or thyme in it. It was very good. I'm also a huge fan of their cheery, deliberately mis-matched but chic decor. I plan on being a regular at the SSE."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast!  The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are fantastic - great texture and a wonderful flavor that almost reminded me of gingerbread.  Fresh squeezed OJ and coffee to die for - my husband's savory biscuits and gravy were excellent as well!  Definitely worth a try.  The line moves quickly!"}
{"text":"Found this 24hr breakfast haven while stumbling around in 2 degrees near the Overture Center and the Orpheum. The windows all look fogged and dark from the outside, but they were actually covered in a gorgeous sheet of frost that was crystallizing around the edges. There's a relaxing homey atmosphere and great music playing from the kitchen. I try to find a solid diner in each city and this place is it. It's not really a classic diner, but it's got all the best breakfast platters made with organic delicious ingredients. There are table, bar and booth seating options. You order at the counter and then pick a seat, your food is brought over to your table.  I got the blind special and a fresh squeezed lemonade. The special was an AMAZING plate of food. The quality of their ingredients is top notch delicious, and cooked just right.  The lemonade was not great though.  Liked the food so much I came back two hours later to try out the buttermilk pancakes and waffles -- killer!!!! They were both fluffy perfection.  The truly real maple syrup that comes with them was a huge treat.  Bough the T-shirt (really cool logo too!) and will be back for more pancakes, and to try their organic fair trade hot cocoa too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did, and the sweet potato pancakes were pretty good, but there's a couple of things that sort of killed it for me.  After ordering at the counter and having to get my own coffee, I realized that what I like most about going out for breakfast is just chilling out and being taken care of... and having to get up 2-3 times to refill my coffee is something I can do at home (the servers had plenty of time on their hands to come around with a carafe).  I took my 7 year old with me and realized afterwards that he more than doubled the price of his main dish by ordering OJ ($3) and a side of bacon ($4.99?!?).  The OJ was fresh squeezed but unless you're in Florida or get lucky with the oranges, its not worth it in Wisconsin (and of course my kid didn't drink it, but I did, because it had pulp!  More a knock on my kid than the restaurant for that).  The bacon was 3 slices that may have been locally sourced, but was nothing special to justify the price."}
{"text":"So overrated. The system of waiting in line then ordering then hoping to find a seat is stressful and confusing. Also no point in waiting so long and paying so much for pancakes than can easily be made at home, to eat in the company of hungover undergrads in sweats."}
{"text":"Just went to Short Stack for the first time and loved it! The Bloody is one of the best in Madison, and definitely the freshest. I ordered the mystery meal (it's $7 if you don't ask what it is, and $12 if you do). I won't tell you what it was either, but I can tell you that it was awesome!"}
{"text":"The service, food & coffee here were amazing! I'm a little adventurous so I did the secret special. What a cool idea!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great milkshakes and pancakes, and good coffee. Prices are higher than you might like, but it's the only place I've had great pancakes in Madison, and the location is cute. Recommended, for certain. Consider getting drinks as well if you're coming in for a late-night trip. They should be open for breakfast during the week! I understand not opening for the all-night option until the weekend, though."}
{"text":"I had the small order of cheesy grits & pork. It was excellent! Should have ordered a full order!!!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often because they're open only a couple days a week and the line is always so long. But as the weather gets warmer it's getting easier to wait for the great food! The eggs are always perfect and the shakes are AMAZING!!! GET THEM!! The menu is very small so sometimes it's hard for people I'm with to find something they really love but they are happy with whatever they get."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Banana milkshake and the pancakes they have here. I ordered the trio with two eggs over easy, pancake, and breakfast potatoes. He potatoes were fine but I recommend adding cheese and onions on them. Delicious food and fast service."}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast sandwich with perhaps even more solid griddled potatoes. Cheese and onions with your potatoes are extra, but very worth it. Get your sandwich on the cheese-roll so you can have both cheese inside your sandwich, and inside your bread. Cheeseception. BURGHHHH (inception sound).  I can't tell if the service was particularly friendly or if this is just how the Midwest rolls. Might be both."}
{"text":"Yum. Second time here. Tried sweet potato oatmeal pancakes. Oatmeal pancakes can sometimes be heavy, but despite the small chunks of sweet potato, these managed to feel light. So good with the smooth marscapone topping and strawberries that I skipped the syrup. Very satisfying--but go with a short stack unless you want leftovers. More staff than my first time here and very helpful when approached. Only two varieties of coffee (plus decaf), but it is an endless cup."}
{"text":"Came here on a late Friday night since there weren't many places open. There was a good amount of people but not busy because of the time. My SO and I sat at the bar area and since it was our first time here, we didn't know that you ordered at the register. It was kind of awkward because there were 3 people behind the counter talking or wiping down their work area, and we had no clue why they weren't acknowledging us. We were looking around to figure out what was going on, and I wish the staff had been more attentive only because we looked absolutely lost for the first 5 minutes. No one attempted to talk to us despite being right in front of them and they were glancing at us the entire time we were trying to figure out how to order. Once we did get our order in, it took a while for our food to come out. We also didn't know that water and was self serve and only figured it out once we saw other people going back and forth from the drinks table.    All in all, good food, but the staff could stand to be a bit more attentive in informing newbies like us. Not everyone is a regular or can pick up on what to do because there was no line of people in front of us to take cues from."}
{"text":"24 hours. Buttermilk pancakes, cheesy grits, crazy Bloody Mary's, breakfast all day and night. Seat yourself and self serve water/Bloody Mary toppings, environment with great corner view of State Street and people watching. Need I say more. Give it a try"}
{"text":"I've been stung by bees twice in the past week, so I'm a bit leery of dining at a place where the front door is held open continuously by patrons waiting in line, while sweet maple syrup flows like a river inside. Luckily, the line was not bad at 11 am on a Sunday morning, and not a bee in sight as we approached the head of the line and read the posted menus for food and drinks, including a cocktail called... \"Sting me\".  Of course I had to order it. It was beelicious, featuring Wisco pop in the mix, which I loooove.  Other beverages include Minnesota-style blisteringly hot coffee from a serve yourself urn, Boom brand, a darker roast, and brewed somewhat weakly. The plastic straw stirrers provided seemed like a very bad idea at those atomic coffee temps.   Because it's me, of course I wanted to pick and choose from the menu offerings and build my own breakfast. They did not bat an eyelash, and it all arrived just exactly as ordered. I really appreciated the attention to detail and listening!  A militant silverware lady mildly scolded me for brashly attempting to pick up my own utensils from the bin right next to the rest of the serve-yourself things. She informed me that I was to wait for my silverware to be delivered with my meal. Ok then. (Don't tell anyone, but I snuck back later when her back was turned and got myself a different fork without bent tines.)  Cheerful server, drinks came quickly, and food soon after. I had one of the much-touted sweet potato oatmeal pancakes, which arrived with sliced strawberries and whipped mascarpone on top. It is a surprisingly light, fluffy textured pancake, and very very good, despite the inclusion of nutmeg (I'm not a fan of that spice). These are pure comfort food, and one was quite enough.  My other dish was a small order of the cheese grits and pulled pork, and that was just yummmmmmmmm. Melt-in-your-mouth tender pork and coarsely ground but creamy grits. I added Valentine hot sauce, and then it was perfect. I was extremely pleased with all my menu choices. The only tiny off-note was the fact that the delicious sourdough toast that came with the meal was not actually toast, but grilled bread. Some people like that; I don't. NBD.  Random note -- the water is not bleachy tasting, as it often is at restaurants (at least to me), and is served at a nice cool temperature. Loved that!  About the service: It's kind of weird how you order and pay upon entry, then seat yourself, then your food is brought, yet you tip at the counter before you've even eaten. Therefore tips are obviously shared, and that could explain the somewhat brusque service. There was wordless removal of one of my plates as a staff member flew by our table. She came back and took more things, never asking if we were finished. Odd to not even be asked.  Couldn't have bee-n happier with this start to our Sunday. Buzz in soon!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes are SO GOOD. I ordered the blind special once, did not regret it. The breakfast sandwiches looked FANTASTIC too,  the people next to me ordered them. There are long lines for brunch, but if you go at \"off hours,\" you'll be fine. The lemonades they have that aren't alcoholic tend to be extremely sweet. I'm going to miss the sweet potato pancakes when I leave Madison!"}
{"text":"I was in for the first time with co-workers for lunch. There's usually a huge line out the door and down the sidewalk anytime I walk or drive by, so this is usually not my first choice when picking a place for 6 of us to eat. But, we got really lucky on a Thursday at noon! We went in and found a table for 6 super easy and grabbed menus to decide on food. I loved the \"Blind\" idea and quickly decided to take the risk. Everything else on the menu looked great, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with that choice. I was not wrong! She delivered my strawberry and rhubarb pancakes and I couldn't be happier! They looked so yummy with the strawberry/rhubarb compote and granola crumble on top and the side of homemade fluffy whipped cream. They were delicious! That compote was the right amount of sweet and the crunchy granola was really nicely baked. Everyone was interested to see what the surprise guest at the table was going to be. They were all drooling over the delicious looking plate in front of me. It does really pay off to take a risk! I'll be back (if the line isn't 50+ people long)."}
{"text":"This is such a cool little gem in downtown Madison. With mainly breakfast food and late night options this place is great for after bar snacks or a late dinner.   I went here after an event at the overture center on a Friday night that ended at 9:00pm. Knowing that a lot of places would be closing soon I opted for short stack since is was next door and is open 24 hours on the weekend. I knew we would not feel rushed as like some places that closed shortly.  I also have been trying to go to short stack for awhile, but on Sunday/Saturday morning when I have tried they usually have a line out the door.   I had heard great things about there Bloody Mary so I ordered one of these and a chocolate chip short stack. The pancakes were rich and delicious. They were the perfect portion for me and hit the spot for the pancake craving I had been having. I am not a huge breakfast person but I do enjoy good pancakes every once and awhile.   The Bloody Mary which is said to have 25 ingredients was different. It was very red/purple in color. I was a fan, it had a complex flavor and a good amount of heat.  I understand where not everyone would like it but if you like vegetables other than tomatoes it is worth a try.   Overall if you like breakfast food I would recommend Short Stack. It is also a great alternative to Ihop or Perkins which are some of the only other restaurants open 24/7 on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that SSE has found a home in a space that has seen so many turnovers over the past few years. I really love what they've done to the place! It is bright, vibrant and so wonderfully decorated. I hope that SSE is here to stay! :)   My only concern: ventilation seems to be a problem in the restaurant. It was wayyyyy tooooo hot (even with multiple fans going at full speed) and I left the restaurant smelling very, very greasy. If it is a nice day and there are seats outside, I would definitely recommend snagging them!  It is nice of them to offer $1 off of all iced drinks for the heat, but I think the long term solution would be to fix the ventilation system.   I ordered the blind special on good faith for a mere ~$7 (!!!) and then decided to tack on a Bloody Mary half way through my meal. I was secretly hoping the blind special would be a savory dish because I wanted something that would go well with the Bloody. Lo and behold, it was a savory dish, and it went spectacularly with the Bloody Mary!  Next time I will be back to try something from the 'sweet' menu! Or I might just roll the die again and take my chances with the blind special. (:"}
{"text":"Short Stack is a good place and I like the 24/7 breakfast option on State St.  The food was okay. Not amazing by any means but it tasted alright.  To be quite honest, it seemed like State St. version of Mickie's and if we're going to compare the two, Mickie's is definitely superior.  That said, Short Stack is still pretty good, a solid option for some good pancakes and such."}
{"text":"The food here is fine, but nothing spectacular. Prices are high for a \"serve your own coffee,water, napkins, etc.\" kind of place. We came here for the \"best bloody Mary's in town\" and ended up with a tall glass of thick spaghetti sauce that was barely drinkable, and had little to no alcohol in it. Two small portion menu items and 2 shitty bloody Mary's cost us 40 bucks.   Not to mention the stupid idea of standing in a line out the door to order, when there are plenty of tables inside to sit at. Expected great things and left completely unimpressed. We suggest you try anywhere else for breakfast, as there was nothing here worthwhile stopping for.  ***Currently being harassed by employees/ fans of this establishment. Many inappropriate emails sent to us criticizing an honest review. Stay classy!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here to check it out because we saw that it was open from Thursday to Sunday and the menu looked interesting.   We ordered at the cash register and picked our seat at the bar area. We had gotten there right before the rush (around 9:15 am on a Saturday).  I had ordered the trio (short stack of pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon) and my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy.   The service was great - the servers were very attentive. The food was delicious and was very happy with it. The bacon was cooked just how I like it, not too crispy and not too soggy. My husband said that the biscuits and gravy were very good & the gravy had a kick to it.  I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Food is incredible. They offer half orders of most things which allowed me to get a half order of biscuits and a short stack of buttermilk pancakes. DELICIOUS midnight meal. 4 stars for the hearty gravy and warm maple syrup with the pancakes.  The 5th star is for the little details that SSE nails--a water station (for humans and fordogs), the brilliant \"blind special,\" and a music selection that covers 90s throwbacks and indie pop hits.  I've been twice in the last week and I just want to go back."}
{"text":"Breakfast itself was really great. I ordered grits and pulled pork and it held up to my southern expectations. However, the organization and management of the restaurant could use some help. There seemed to be a mix seating arrangement where some people were seated by the hostess and others just grabbed a table for themselves. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and had trouble coordinating table arrangements- moving couples from table to table multiple times. In addition, all the staff didn't seem to be on the same page and the food took over 45 minutes to get to the table. Since its a new restaurant, I am sure the communication and organization kinks will be worked out soon and the good food will become center stage."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here for about two years because I had such bad experiences on those earlier visits.  Thought I'd try it again, assuming they had worked out all the issues the past few years.  Unfortunately, the same old problems made for another poor dining experience.  Food is good, no complaints.  Price, way too high and service, incredibly slow, particularly for a breakfast joint.  We were two of only six patrons in the place, and still a long wait for food.  Finally, why do they allow it to remain so hot.  I was so uncomfortable this morning, I was just not able to enjoy my meal.  Simply, I will not go back, and I recommend you consider other options."}
{"text":"While I miss the short stint, 24hrs/day novelty of being open non-stop Thursday-Sunday, I still make time to plan meals here whenever people are in town and want a good place to brunch. The setup of ordering first means that the wait time (even when lines are out the door and people waiting fill the standing areas) never quite seems as long as it is or as you think it'll be. The blind special is my favorite. It's always a great meal, even when I've gotten a spinach quiche with a large salad that didn't entirely align with my typical red-meat-craving breakfast sensibilities, and I always need to make sure at least one of us at the table has ordered it."}
{"text":"People in Madison are OBSESSED with Short Stack. I think it's good, but a little overpriced and overrated. Overall, it's a great restaurant to have on a college campus - slightly fancier than Sunroom Café but below prices of places like Sardine or Graze. The interior is absolutely delightful - SSE did the cutest job of decorating their glass tables and accessorizing the restaurant to feel like a sunroom at all times. In general, the menu is good but for breakfast food, a lot of it I do feel as if I could make at home without the prices. That being said, there are a few redeeming items that make it 100% worth it to stop by to try:  1) Sweet Potato Oatmeal Pancakes. My old roommates forced me to go back to SSE after I was hesitant and this really won me over. These are actual PERFECTION. Naturally sweet, grainy, wholesome, and topped with mascarpone, fresh strawberries, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. I dream for SPOP.   2) Breakfast Potatoes. It's like...the potatoes you want to make, but would never make for yourself because they are the definition of buttery goodness. But it's okay when someone else makes them for you because then it just melts in your mouth and the entire world feels good again.  3) Blind Special. Every day, there is a Blind Special that is 50% off - it is what it sounds like. You're allowed to ask if it is sweet or savory, but the rest is up to the Chef for that day. I've almost never been disappointed by this (and your wallet definitely thanks you!) and generally trust the judgment. If you're feeling risky and want to save a few bucks, this is definitely the move! You never know what you'll find. :)   Overall, cute restaurant that is a little overpriced with some unique menu items to check out (see above!!!!)."}
{"text":"My husband and I would give three stars to SSE. Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant. We enjoy reading names and addresses on many envelopes under the glass on the table. The quality of food would deserve four stars had we not ordered French toast. The dish came in a lovely decoration of three baguettes, fresh strawberries and blueberries. However, the baguettes were too hard. I found it very difficult to cut them in pieces and more difficult to chew every piece of them. I couldn't finish them and left one piece on the plate without feeling regret of not asking for a box. My husband got the Trio and he loved the chocolate chip pancakes. So our suggestion is that ask before you order French toast and avoid it if it's made from baguettes."}
{"text":"We had quite the variety - short stacks, sweet potato pancakes, sausage chorizo burrito and pulled pork with cheesy grits. The atmosphere is awesome - a cool artsy hodgepodge breakfast eatery. Also a lot of self serve items which I was not used to but loved the idea (read the back of the menu - it tells you how it's done. New to Madison and this will be a breakfast treat staple!"}
{"text":"More than likely, if you are visiting Short Stack Eatery on Saturday or Sunday you will have a 30+ minute outside. The wait in line is a pain, but it isn't terrible if the weather is nice.   There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian menu options which is great for any of your friends to dine on. There are also fun brunch drinks that will exhilarate your taste buds.   The service is absolutely incredible and the food is amazing. You will have to get your own water and the place is a bit cramped.   I would highly reccomend this space."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!!!!!! It's on a Stella's hot&spicy cheese bread roll....   This restaurant is extremely clever and fun! For example they have a  \"blind special\" that you get half off if you don't ask what it is"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by Short Stack.   I came here a few months ago with 2 other people. We placed our order at the counter and were seated at a table pretty quickly (we got here pretty early on a Sunday, but there was a long line).   The coffee was not the greatest, but it was nice that it was self-serve and you could refill if you like. I ordered the blind special, which was a breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun, and my companions ordered the blueberry short stack and sweet potato short stack with sides of the sausage and potatoes. My sandwich was just ok...there was wayyy too much mustard on the bun, which made it hard to appreciate the other components. The portion was also pretty small, and I felt that if I had chosen to ask what the special was (costs you ~$13 vs $7 if blind), it would have been overpriced. The pancakes were good, but not anything spectacular. We did enjoy the fall spices in the sweet potato pancakes. The sausage and potato sides were TINY portions, and they were greasy and not great. Overall, the pancakes were definitely the best thing we ordered, and they were generous portions. For whatever reason, the sweet potato pancakes were quite a bit larger than the blueberry ones, even though they were the same size order.  I would come back just for the pancakes, but probably not for the other menu items."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place. We were early, so not that busy. Got our orders completely wrong. English break fast tea came as mint tea. Two simple scrambled 2 egg orders came as only one. And the replacement order, which i then requested as poached, came TWENTY minutes later. By the my toast was cold and I was crabby. Made the start of my last day of vacation miserable. Never again!  Suggest you make it EXTREMELY clear if you order anything other than the pancakes or french toast!"}
{"text":"Cute.   I came here with my husband and two of our friends on a Saturday around 12:00pm, the line was out the door. I like the concept and the story behind the owners. I had a waffle that tasted more like a pancake and it wasn't horrible but not the best. I've heard of the \"Blind Special\" and I may or may not try it one day. I understand the hype about Short Stack but it's definitely not for everybody. I plan on returning to leave a better review."}
{"text":"Were in town from Palm Beach ... starving for some great breakfast food pared with Wisconsin hospitality.. after driving around town looking we decide on Short Stack.. If your looking for hospitality or service .. NOT ! There is a wait as you approach the front of the line someone takes your order, give you a table stand number, you stand on the side waiting for a stone faced staff to appoint you to a table. As they pride their self as a great breakfast experience they are missing every bit of that in service. It's no more than a $40 breakfast human drive thur for two ? The food is good .. fresh Delish pancake cheese eggs and bacon .. cold butter fresh squeezed juice. Had to ask for a straw that was delivered unwrapped in her bare hand  As the server drops the food she tell you if you need something get up and get it yourself.. Great concept to reduce labor cost. But totally not about service.."}
{"text":"I've been three times and it's always great. I've never had to wait for a table, even with large (8+) parties. I always get the blind special because it's such a fun concept and so far have not been disappointed by any of the specials. I also have tasted the grits and pork and its soooo good. Plan to return again!"}
{"text":"Great place downtown with awesome made from scratch foods. The pancakes were some if.the best I have had outside of making them myself. Right off doentown with a cool vibe. I eat here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait; this place is awesome. Do yourself a favor and get the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes. They were phenomenal. Fresh squeezed orange juice was also excellent. The staff was very friendly. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal. The oatmeal pancakes were delicious and the Cajun biscuits were great. The ambiance had a San Fran vibe which I liked and they used a lot of local ingredients."}
{"text":"Everything on this menu is delicious. You cannot go wrong. If you're from Madison, you should know that. This place is well known for a reason! Usually I go with the blind special or the sweet potato pancakes but I definitely venture off and try new things all the time! The most recent actually, is what made me write this review. I had the burrito and buttermilk pancakes. Which holy crap, I never had because they seemed like 2 or the more \"normal\" things, but I was wrong. Sometimes simple is more. The burrito was so flavorful and like super breakfast burrito. The pancakes were what a good, classic set of fluffy pancakes should be like. Don't let that deter you from trying some of my favorites like the Cajun biscuits or sweet potato stack, but know that the simple things are pretty awesome too. The only thing I've had which I am not a huge fan of are the grits . They're good ! Just not amazing compared to a bunch of other things I've had on the menu. So yes, still 5 stars from me. If you can come at a time or day that the line is not down the block, you should take it as a sign to taste their great menu."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I went here the other day with my boyfriend after I was done with work. I love the fact you order in front and they bring it too you.   My boyfriend got the French toast and an iced coffee. I didn't have a bite, but it looked so amazing. The French toast was covered with fluffy whipped cream and strawberries.   I got the \"trio\" where they list different breakfast items and you get to choose! It was perfect and the potatoes were fabulous:)"}
{"text":"Great place for brunchers! The hours are a little weird, but overall a nice place.   The bloody isn't for everyone, but I love it! It tastes like a fresh harvest from a veggie patch mixed with spices and vodka! Yum! Food is pretty good. I usually am adventurous and go with the \"Blind Special.\" They charge you full price if you ask what it is, but only half if you go in blind.   Negatives: usually a long wait, crowded, not enough outdoor seating, wasn't a huge fan of the cheesy grits."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant in this downtown location.    Breakfast 24 hours a day for the weekend.  Excellent.  I had an opportunity to eat there one night around ten pm after a show at the comedy club.  I rolled with the Blind Special to be adventurous.  It was a delish hash.  Yummy.  I ordered a side of pancakes just in case I didn't like the special.  The pancakes ended up going home with me for breakfast the next day.  Double Yum!  My Friends enjoyed their choices, too.  I would visit here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place all day.  I got a bloody, DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. I could have ate it with a spoon it was so thick. Not my cup of tea.   Food is pretty good, if you want breakfast all day and feel like a step up from Dennys then you found the place."}
{"text":"First off, the Bloody Mary was terrible, and not so sure how everyone seems to rave about them being so remarkable on here. From the very second it rolled over to our table I could tell it was going to be awful, having the color of a strawberry rhubarb pie.. It was EXTREMELY chunky.... So sorry, I prefer to drink my bloody mary's, not chew them.... When advising the waitress we were displeased with the drink, they had us go up to the counter to return at which point we were told we would have to pay for it.... Sorry but I'm not paying for something that tastes like S***....... End of that rant....  Second issue.... For a table of 4 it was $85... That's right, for breakfast....... When ordering at a counter and then being told to go fetch my own ketchup when I asked the waitress once our food arrived, I feel this place can do a little more when charging this kind of dough for breakfast food, and having minimal service provided other than your drinks and food coming to you....  Third issue... Dust all over the light fixtures and misc. mess on the floors. For me, if an establishment cannot keep the main area of the place clean, what's going on in the back.... Our table had a glass top, with a chip missing out of the corner, at which my guest received a small cut on her forearm. When advising the waitress about it, the only answer we received was \"watch out for that corner from now on.\" NBD, but still, it's all about the service to me....  The only reason I gave Two Stars is for the food. The breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito were very good, while the potatoes had a bit too much of rosemary for my taste, they were still very good.   To me, for the price, this place could do a little more for your, and work on its service a little. If you wear skinny jeans and take part in the protests at the capitol square, this place is probably right up your alley. As for me, i'll never be back in this place by choice. There are far too many other choices that don't run upwards of $100 for BREAKFAST, and where you actually get served by a waitress/waiter, rather than ordering at a counter...... End Rant...   Cheers!"}
{"text":"We came in from out of town and were met with a long line upon entering. Don't let that intimidate you or change your mind! Waiting in line to order ends up being a plus, because you can leave whenever, you don't have to wait for someone to bring you your bill. The water is also self serve which is awesome because you don't have to wait for that either.   And the food? Amazing. Not something I would do every day, because it's a little pricey, but it is well worth the money. Not only are you supporting a local business, but also local farms etc.   A must try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because in theory it sounds like an appealing weekend brunch spot.  Open 24 hours a day all weekend?  Pancakes?  What could go wrong?  In sum, I found this place to be an overhyped, expensive restaurant that lacked in food quality and service.  When I went here with my friend, it was around April and still chilly weather.  The way the restaurant is set up, customers have to wait outside because there is not enough room in front of the hostess stand to wait.  After standing in the chilly spring weather, I was already not a happy camper.  When we finally got in, I was shocked at how expensive my meal was (around $20 for eggs benedict and a bloody mary).  I thought this was a college friendly restaurant and I couldn't imagine what kind of college student could afford to drop that much money on breakfast.  The bloody mary I ordered was made with beet juice instead of tomato juice, which sounded interesting in theory, but failed in execution.  There was a very strong vinegar taste that made it impossible to drink.  The eggs in my eggs benedict were raw.  Raw as in the egg whites weren't fully cooked.  My $20 meal was wasted on basically inedible food.  The real issue with this place is that since you order before you sit down, the wait staff brings your food and then completely ignores you.  I tried and failed to flag down a waitress to complain about my meal, so I was stuck sipping on my beer chaser and having a bite of my friend's overcooked bacon.   The ridiculously high prices, poor food quality and terrible service overall made having brunch here a negative experience.  There are so many good places to get brunch in Madison that I don't see this place lasting long unless they make some major changes."}
{"text":"Ah-max-zing!!! Best damn pancakes this planet has to offer!  We visited short stack on a Friday morning after completing a free workout at the capital with November Project and I was hesitant at first of ordering the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes but they were to die for!  Also they have a blind order special which if you order you get half off. This time it was an omelette which was very tasty."}
{"text":"literally brunch goals! Their eggs, bacon, and potatoes were amazing!! Definitely worth the 45 minutes wait and line out the door. Also, it's instagram worthy! I will for sure go back there next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"Short Stack seems to be a hybrid of casual self serve restaurants like Lazy Jane's and a traditional server-oriented sit down place.  As you may have surmised, brunch foods only!  If you arrive when there's a wait, a the host will give you a license plate with your table number and ask you to wait till called. When it's your turn, you are permitted to order at the counter and pay.  There's a tip line on the CC receipt--I was  confused if tipping was obligatory like at a typical restaurant, though.  Coffee and water is self serve.   A bar island in the middle provides drinks and some seating, and there are tables as well as two large booths.  The table was pretty interesting; the tabletop glass had old letters and postcards, I read a letter from the 1950s from a young woman who had lost her ring while travelling and was writing a note to her mother.  As for the food, they were behind on ticket times but the restaurant was also quite busy with people waiting to be seated. It seems that when there was no longer a wait to order, they did catch up with their ticket times, but I do think we waited more than 20 minutes between being seated and receiving food.   Food: we ordered sweet potato pancakes (sweet) and blueberry pancakes.  The sweet potato pancakes were very good, a little bit of crust on the pancake (which I like so it's not all the same texture) and small chunks of sweet potato.  I appreciated the homemade dollop of whipped cream and strawberries.  Blueberry pancakes had blueberries folded in and scattered with berries.  Both dishes certainly had enough bang for your buck in terms of serving size.  I preferred the sweet potato pancakes; they were very moist and were more unique.  Restaurant is wheelchair accessible and I spotted 2 highchairs and booster seats, no kids' menu. You could bring kids here but it's definitely marketed more towards college students.  Overall, SSE exceeded my expectations, since this is the owners' first restaurant.  But it seems like they did really work hard for it (UW undergrads who started working at restaurants specifically to qualify for a loan to open SSE).  I would recommend it to people looking for breakfast in the area, although parking in this vicinity can be tough."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich are delicious but the best thing I've tried was the sweet potato pancakes. I can't wait to go back for those! The Bloody Mary was very unique. If you're looking for a traditional one, this is not the place. But the beet based one they serve is fun if you're a Bloody enthusiast."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations because of all the recommendations of this place. The place itself is very interesting, with a nice and relaxing atmosphere, a little bit crowded but very cozy at the same time. The tables and walls are nicely decorated. And the staff are also very friendly.  As for food, I tried the breakfast sandwich. Wasn't really what I expected, but it still tastes good. The breakfast burrito looks like a huge portion. Should get that if you came here with an extremely empty stomach. The blind special wasn't really that special, but I guess that's part of the game?  The milkshakes were great!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch at 11 and there was a line out the door!! This place is definitely popular and with my first bite of their sweet potato oatmeal pancakes I could tell why... They. Were. Amazing. Just the right amount of thickness and sweetness, these pancakes were like no other pancake I've tasted before! For a unique experience in taste and retro decor, I would absolutely recommend checking this place out! Make sure you have scheduled enough time though, as waiting to order then finding a table can be quite a task. I wish it was open for more of the week--it's only open Thursday through Sunday...*tears* The service was great, all very friendly! And when my friend ordered a small banana chocolate milkshake, and they didn't realize until later they were out of bananas, they upgraded her to a regular sized milkshake for the inconvenience! What a great way to handle the situation. Check this place out and get the sweet potato oatmeal pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious!! I was visiting Madison over the weekend and HAD to check out the newest breakfast hotspot. I ended up coming for an after bar late night meal, AND breakfast the next day!! At night i ordered the breakfast burrito. Because i do not eat meat, i was able to substitute the chorizo with any veggies of my choice for no extra charge!! I ordered mine with broccoli and mushrooms and it was amazing. I got it with a side of mixed greens that had such a delicious sweet vinaigrette on them. So good! The next morning we came back and i had the baked french toast. O. M. G. holy cow. This is not your average french toast. It looked to be ciabatta bread, or something similar, sliced into long thick strips, with a lot of crunchy crust and a super soft center. It was topped with walnuts and served with fresh strawberrys and a really tasty whipped cream. i did not even have to add syrup. SO. GOOD. i can't wait to go back and taste everything else on the menu!!  In addition to the food being outstanding, the atmosphere and restaurant itself is perfection. Such a great location. The staff was very helpful and friendly. There were fresh flowers on every table. Cute breakfast quotes on the chalkboards (fans of It's Always Sunny will appreciate this! Be sure to pay attention!). The tables had old postcards and letters mounted under the glass. Every detail of this place was the perfect mix of charming and modern without trying too hard. Short Stack Eatery is by far my new favorite breakfast joint. And late night joint. I mean, who doesn't love breakfast all day!?"}
{"text":"My food was really good. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes and they did not disappoint. Service was quick and pleasant.  My only complaint is that the restaurant itself is really warm inside. I was sweating at the end of being there for breakfast."}
{"text":"There are no lack of places to eat in downtown Madison. Given all the great restaurants in our city, you'd think someone besides Original Pancake House could figure out how to make a great breakfast with fresh ingredients. Short Stack Eatery was even better than the word of mouth led me to believe. Best pancakes off my life, relaxed atmosphere....only complaint is that they aren't open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Truly overrated almost as much as they are overpriced. Sorry-took my son for an early morning outing for breakfast and while they weren't packed (07:30 Saturday morning) they weren't quick either. The coffee is good. Pancakes not so much."}
{"text":"First of all, I loved walking in and seeing that this place is run by women, I've never seen that before. Second, despite the fact that I came on Friday at about 1 pm and it wasn't as crowded as it usually is, we still had to wait in line for about 15 minutes. Not sure I would want to wait in line during high volume time. Never the less, the food was great. My friend and I got the egg white scrambler and the trio with sausage, pancakes, and greens. Glad I checked this off my list, and if the line is ever relatively short then I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"The short stack sweet potato pancakes were fantastic. There were chicks of sweet potato in the pancakes, it was a nice surprise because they were warm.  Not on top like they normally are.  It does take a while for the food to come. It is worth the wait but you can't be in a rush.  The place is a bit warmer then the average restaurant but just sit back and relax with some juice or something.  The decor is trendy and looks like a college hang out.  I will defiantly go again. I will just not be in a rush."}
{"text":"The line is always out the door for this breakfast/brunch place. I have been here twice and my experience both times have been similar. The food is good, the decor/ambiance is lovely, the staff work really hard, the coffee is meh but the wait time for food is LONG. Both times I have been, I have had to wait 45 minutes to an hour for brunch food and I find that a little ridiculous. I am not sure if they are always short on cooks or if their kitchen is too small but breakfast food should not take that long to cook. And I also feel bad watching people stand around looking for an empty table while I am sitting, waiting to get my meal, eat my meal and get out. They need to work on that."}
{"text":"Short Stack is a FABULOUS place to eat. The structure, vibe and aesthetic are all on point. A definite staple on the UW Madison campus. If you're feeling daring- go for the blind, which is priced great at only $7 (unless you ask what it is, then it's $11!) in which they pick some random menu items for you. Considering that I love basically everything on their menu, this is always my go-to option. Their buttermilk pancakes and maple syrup are my holy grail here though. The lines are always busy in the mornings on weekends, expect about a 30 minute wait. My ideal time to go is later at night around 6pm.  All condiments and water is self serve at the back of the restaurant so the only interaction with staff is when ordering and when they are giving you your food. This allows for some interaction but also gives costumers the power to keep everything running smoothly. It's a unique set up! Prices are pretty fair for what you get and while you wait for your food you can be entertained by things on the tabletop!"}
{"text":"I've never found the food to be particularly outstanding, and it wouldn't ever be my first choice. However, prices are really good and the atmosphere and staff are both great. I also love their idea of being 24 hours on the weekends - Madison was in need of an all-night diner! I definitely miss living within walking distance to this place."}
{"text":"I've been trying a few new brunch spots recently in the hopes of finding something a little better than the usual continental style that you see frequently in Madison.  Short Stack is a refreshing change of pace, and one in a line of relative newcomers that are trying to change things up.  I had heard about it from friends as a \"college breakfast place that's open just about 24 hours\" which while cool didn't really entice me to make a trip for it.  Thankfully yelp reviews, their website, and pictures all looked quite appealing so I made a visit.  The atmosphere is almost exactly what I like on a lazy Sunday afternoon; very open and lots of natural light coming in, friendly conversation from young but knowledgble wait staff, and a mixture of service with a do-it-yourself vibe (they have a water and extras table setup).  The central bar is a fun focal point of the restaurant, and they have just the right amount of tables to make it a comfortable time.  I see far too many places jamming their space to the brim to the point where you can't enjoy your supposedly \"relaxing\" brunch.  Short Stack doesn't have this issue.  I ordered the Cajun biscuit and gravy after a great amount of deliberation as many of their items sound fantastic.  It was about as awesome as it sounds, and completely hit the spot.  The portion size was just right too, I'm a fairly big eater but this was satisfying without being crazytown.  My only gripes were that it did get a little loud, I think accoustically the space isn't great, however it was still quite comfortable for conversation to the contrary of what some other reviewers said.  Secondly, the door to the restauraunt was wide open the entire time on a hot summer day, and personally I'm not a big fan of that because it means bugs are probably coming in and getting into the kitchen (which is open air visible to the tables).  Close the door and stay sanitary and that will win the last bit of me over.  I like the decor of the restaurant a lot, it has an old tea party like feel (not to be confused with the political party), with a very warm, positive atmosphere.  I'd definitely eat here again soon"}
{"text":"Having never been here before, I knew the line out the door was an indication of a great meal ahead. This is an eclectic place with fun people behind the counters and awesome cooks.  I ordered the Trio with traditional eggs, bacon and potatoes...\"chucky style\". It is a lot of food!  The potatoes were not ordinary-they add cheese (you can't go wrong there-this is Wisconsin!) and carmelized onions.  Delish! You order first then take a seat-meals are prepared quick.  Don't hesitate to make a trip here- just be aware of the hours...Thursday 7 am straight through til Sunday night at 11 pm."}
{"text":"We passed by this little place at night and were super intrigued. Afterward I was jonesin' for pancakes all night long, so we made it our breakfast stop. It was great.  I had a stack of blueberry pancakes and the wife had the Trio. Both were de-lish. The pancakes had a perfectly crispy crust. So good  The people sitting next to us got the breakfast burrito and that looked fabulous also. Trying it next time"}
{"text":"Staying in a hotel nearby. Ordered a choc chip stack to go for eating later tonight when things close up. Three pancakes - got back to the hotel, opened them up. Two are straight up burnt. What's the deal? I'll post photos."}
{"text":"Sweet potato in a pancake? Yes, it has been done. And it is glorious.   The sweet potato oatmeal pancakes at Short Stack Eatery will have you questioning how all nearby breakfast restaurants are still in business. If everyone knew how delicious these cakes were, Short Stack would be giving all competitors a serious run for their money.   These spiced oatmeal pancakes are whipped up with real sweet potatoes and served with a generous dollop of bourbon-maple mascarpone and fresh strawberries. A plate of these guys is comfort food at its best. While they are hearty and filling, the fact that you just ate oatmeal and sweet potato makes you feel good about yourself.   Pancakes are the new health food, have you heard?"}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers, we found that the negatives of the experience really outweighed the positives of the food quality. We went on Sunday morning, and by 10 it was already busy. After ordering at the counter, the only spots available to sit were  at the counter. And there we found the first problem. The seats at the counter are such poor quality that both of them had rungs that had fallen out and they both swayed unstably. But all of them were like that!  We then thought it was a pain to have to navigate through the crowds to get water and coffee from the one table near the kitchen. It seemed odd - there were plenty of staff, but most of them seemed to have little to do, and were standing around a lot. Why not just make this table service?   As we waited for our food, I noticed that over half of the people seated were also waiting for their food. The kitchen, despite being well staffed, was s-l-o-w. They were putting an order up about every 5 minutes, which is ridiculously slow for a packed place. It took just under 30 minutes from ordering to getting our food.   The food was solid. My blueberry pancakes were perfectly cooked, albeit a little chewy. The biscuits and gravy were nice, with a good obviously homemade biscuit and flavorful gravy. (I would have used andouille sausage if I were making this dish, but they used regular. Just a suggestion).   But my biggest complaint, by far, was that even though they said my pancakes came with maple syrup, it wasn't maple syrup! At least, not pure maple syrup. I could tell due to the wrong consistency and taste. Come on, people! In Wisconsin, if you claim to be serving Maple syrup, you have to serve maple syrup.   There are so many other great options for breakfast in Madison that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch here! The service was great even though they were incredibly busy. Their chocolate milkshake was amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves milkshakes. If you order the large then be prepared for large! I had eggs and toast with bacon and everything was great. I really wanted a size of avocado but noticed that avocado wasn't listed as a side. However, the staff were nice enough to give me a side of avocado anyway. The atmosphere is bright and fun and i love that your table number is made out of a car number plate. Really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Short Stack may be named after their pancakes, but their other options do not disappoint.  Arriving on a Sunday for brunch with a friend I was immediately surprised by how packed it was inside. They do not take reservations and seating is all on your own, but it's worth the work to stay and find a table. We ordered at the front and found a couple of spots at the bar in the center of the restaurant.  I had the breakfast burrito with cheesy potatoes. My breakfast burrito was good, but the real deal was the blind special. My friend ordered it and it turned out to be a delightful caprice eggs Benedict that day.   If you feel courageous or broke, give the special a try for half of what it would regularly cost. It's a great way to give something new a try!"}
{"text":"Must try! There was a wait but it's worth it. Great drinks and juice. Breakfast sandwich was awesome and so were the \"chuckie brown\" potatoes. Pancakes are good too. Adorable interior with hilarious brunch related quotes all around."}
{"text":"Order the oatmeal sweet potato pancakes!!!!  I might fly back to Madison from California just for another serving!!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre,  the staff was kind of rude and the ordering and seating system is asinine.   It's also pretty lame that you have to get your own water and condiments.   Beers are all in bottles and cans and are priced really high.  $8 for a Founders Breakfast Stout.  Ouch."}
{"text":"Ridiculous! Guess you have to be under 20, drunk or just stupid to wait in line for this mediocre Bfast fare- waiting in line to order, waiting with a plate of food for a table, running out of silverware and getting plastic utensils instead! Maybe you should close the other days of the week too!"}
{"text":"This was fun! They do breakfast items all day. You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table. Really cute interior with a variety of kitchen sets. Another fun thing is the \"blind special\". There was a sign saying to ask about it, so I did. There is a new one everyday and if you don't ask what it is, it is $6.50, if you do have them tell you what it is it is $9 or $10, can't remember exactly. They will tell you if it is sweet or savory and vegetarian or not. I did it...that day it was pulled pork on a pretzel bun with caramelized onions and a perfectly fried egg on top. It was served with a side of spring mix lightly dressed. My dining companion had blueberry pancakes and she said they were good. They also ha d a Bloody Mary bar. They bring you a Mason jar filled with ice and then you mix up your Bloody Mary with a variety of toppings. We are for sure doing that next time! The people that waited on us were friendly and efficient, no complaints there. Will definitely go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed , when u pay an exhornant amount for two eggs toast and potatoes and wait 40 minutes for your food and another half hour to get in the door u should get perfect eggs and potatoes my eggs were over cooked my potatoes undercooked overall id give this place a 1 out of five overpriced poor service over cooked undercooked - just makes for a bad dining experience - one that I wouldn't go back for seconds"}
{"text":"Very fun place to check out for brunch. Loved the artwork, license plate order numbers, and phrases written around the place! Had a Bloody Mary which was very thick almost smoothie like Mix. Was not a fan due to thickness but others reported they loved it. Had Cajun biscuits and gravy which were bomb! They also have a surprise item on their menu you can order if you're feeling adventurous. The small portion choices were enough for us since we had a light snack earlier in the day! The food was all good!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for breakfast. I love their no-nonsense, semi-self serve, friendly yet professional atmosphere. The food was fantastic. I was glad I ordered \"the blind\". It's a mystery item on the menu. You don't know what you get until it arrives at your table."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday morning so we expected a wait, and it' wasn't too bad.  It's an odd setup though, you order at the counter, take a number and head to your table but the coffee is self serve in the back of the restaurant, so it's a huge hassle if it's packed busy!  We were drawn in by the \"famous\" bloody mary (we are bloody mary afficionados) and it was WAY over hyped!  It tasted like cucumbers and pickle juice and was WAY too chunky.  The garnishes and presentation were fantastic but overall not worth the $10+.    The food was good, not superb, but good.  I had the sweet potato pancakes and they were great, but nothing else was memorable.  A great spot to sit and people watch but I won't be craving it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place, but the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is because the pancakes were smaller (serving size) than I expected and not that much more special than other regular pancakes I have had.   Cute decor / ambiance and good service. Nice big windows with lots of natural light.  I probably wouldn't line up for as long as I did if I were to go again. Would go again, though, because it was a solid experience overall. Just try to avoid the line if possible, for a more pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"I've been here a several times now and I always order the blind special because everything else is too pricey.  The first couple times the food was delicious, which is why I've been back so many times.  However, the past 2 times I've been here haven't been great.  One of the times I was served a bowl of bland, flavorless oatmeal/rice pudding with about 2 blueberries on top, definitely not worth more than about a dollar.  On my most recent visit I ended up with a TINY amount of scrambled eggs with pesto (tasted pretty good) next to a huge pile of lettuce completely soaked in super strong vinegar dressing.  Yuck!  I know that ordering the blind special means I might not love the food but these past two visits have made me hesitant to come back."}
{"text":"Great new place.  Menu is not extensive but the quality and fact it's locally sourced makes this my fun little go-to place now.  Great coffee, fresh ingredients and quick service!  Note that it's a bit on the pricey side but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great, cute place with something for everyone at all hours! Our group included carnivores, a vegetarian, and a gluten-free-er, and everyone was pleased with the menu. With bread from Stella's, the breakfast sandwiches were the biggest crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"If there weren't so many amazing brunch places in Madison, I might give this place 5 stars. The service was not that great, I guess because they were transitioning from their late night crew to their morning crew. I got pancakes and they were alright."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pancakes in the world: sweet potato oatmeal pancakes. Service has always been great and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. However, on one occasion, they burnt my pancakes twice. They were very apologetic and gave me a gift card to make up for the inconvenience. If you live in Madison or are passing through and want the best food you've ever had in your life, come here."}
