{"text":"Wanted to give this place a shot as it was my local Caribbean joint, but boy was I disappointed.  There was one measly piece of jerk chicken left, which I wanted to order anyway (since I was craving it) and tried to order it with a small oxtail.  Turns out that you can't do that, so I ended up having to order two small dinners which came with two large heaps of rice & beans (that I didn't particularly care for).  

The total was about $16 and what I got for that money simply wasn't worth it.  The jerk chicken wasn't even jerked; it had been out for awhile and was quite dry.  Against my better judgment, I ate it.  The oxtail was mostly fat and very little meat. 

I'm not going back to this place, but I had to cross it off my list."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that Lakay is Toronto's only Haitian restaurant... and it's not your typical \"Caribbean\" eatery. I grew up eating Haitian food my entire life and as far as I am concerned they deliver. This is my soul food and I can't help but smile every time I eat here... it feel like home in a way. I recommend Griot which is deep fried pork cubes.  The portions are quite generous and I always have to bring the left overs home.

The only reason I won't give this place a perfect five-star rating is because aesthetically the place looks sort of ghetto! If you can get over tacky paintings and plastic trays you'll have an awesome meal :-)

Oh and they have 3 domestic bottles of beer for $10... that is sort of a sick deal!"}
