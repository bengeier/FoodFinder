{"text":"GETTHO! The owner has no ethic standards. Does not have the courage to have a discussion with his guest, instead offers to give your money back. I payed for a table and when got there he told me that the tables were not purchased online. I even showed him my ticket. If you know you do not have the equipment, professionalism to deal with your guest and the space; you obviously have to go to a business school like I am that can help you develop that skill. Never again!"}
{"text":"boooooooo!!!  we are here for the frank reyes concert and they told us not to dance because this is a concert!! wtf!!!  never again!"}
{"text":"Vengan a LA rumba night club se pone bueno Los Domingo's noche Latina bachata, salsa merenge,"}
{"text":"Great place for some Latin music.  The bartenders were amazing. Yessi made the experience!!!!  I would love to come back on another night and see how busy this place could really be. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice place for some Latin music , they play everything . $25 bucket for six beers Party starts happening around 11:00 pm to 11:30 pm . Lots of tables and chairs to sit on . This is the place to go on a Sunday night ."}
{"text":"Es muy mala onda engañar a la gente. Yo vine por un concierto y no por estar en un Nightclub ni mucho menos por venir a perder el tiempo. Los boletos del concierto claramente dice que el SHOW EMPIEZA a las 9pm - llegamos y resulta que el show no va a empezar si no hasta la 1am. Como es permitido engañar así????  Como se permite este tipo de engaño?!  Solo estoy en este lugar por la banda musical. Nunca mas vendré aquí."}
{"text":"This is a fun locals' bar and dance floor for latin music lovers. It is a bit far from the Strip but has plenty of great security staff and free parking available. I have never seen fights or disrespect at this place. It may look a little run down but you will enjoy the atmosphere. Go for it!"}
{"text":"DO NOT PAY WITH YOUR CARD!!!! TAKE CASH ONLY!!!!!!!!! I used my card ONCE and woke up to 2 different transactions!!!! What a scam!!!!!!!!!!!  Music was good but that's about it hole in a wall in another words!!! The guy bartender will try to play you and give you different prices for the same drink. He TRIED doing that 3 times with me and my friends. Never again. Go to the Spanish spot on the strip by the Linq."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Worst nightclub I have ever been too. Music sucked, place was dirty, and security guards were total assholes making fun of my weight. To be completely honest, they have no room commenting on other people's appearance when they themselves should lay off the beer and all the rest of the crap they ingest. Save your time and money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for frank Reyes concert. My friend bought the \"vip table tickets\" for extra $15 a person to be told when he arrived that he had to pay extra $200 if he wanted a table. He could have bought the GA ticket instead.. Also this is a Latin venue playing all types of dance music so of course people are going to want to dance and my group got told not to dance! What?!?!  When I called earlier they said frank would come out 12-12:30. The man did not come out until 2:20am by then I didn't even care about seeing him anymore but stayed until about 3:15.   Bad service too. Saw someone with a table have to come to the bar to grab ice because they didn't have a server."}
{"text":"Music is A 4. But the main reason for a low review is he guy bar tender tried to jip me. I gave him a 100 dolla bill and he only gave me back 8 bucks. No apology. Thief"}
{"text":"That place is so shady! We ended up there because we were looking for a Latin night. The music was ok but it just felt weird being there."}
