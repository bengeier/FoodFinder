{"text":"Probablement la meilleure pizza en ville. Il faut dire que la concurrence n'est pas dure à battre...Plus cher mais la qualité en vaut le coût. Le smokmeat est bien aussi. Pour ce qui est de manger à l'intérieur c'est pas mon genre de resto."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza.  Beaucoup de garniture... une pizza remplie de calories et de bon gout!"}
{"text":"La pizza  et le service est parfait et la facture aussi. J'y retournerai a vie ...o:)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Laval!!!!  Love this place but finding parking on a busy night is hell. Also they don't take debit so if you don't carry cash like I do hope you have credit card if not you have to use the private ATM they have and all the extra fees that comes with it.  This place as been around for a long time and the decor could be updated a little. The place is pretty big and it is also good for groups.  The pizza is amazing and my all time favourite is the \"Special Vimont\" without onions and extra bacon. Their pizza is bigger than other places around town so be sure to be hungry or be ready to bring some back home."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza des milles à la ronde! On en mange depuis 30 ans, livrée ou sur place; très dure à battre."}
{"text":"Excellent food enormous plates efficient service elegant decore all at a economic value and open till midnight. Will eat there again and again"}
{"text":"Très bon ! Le temps d'attente est un peu long, mais on y mange toujours bien!  Vraiment de la bonne bouffe. !"}
{"text":"Je ne comprend pas la bonne réputation de ce restaurant.   J'ai commandé une pizza hawaïenne et elle est arrivé oui, débordante de garnitures, mais pas assez cuits et surtout flottant dans un jus au point que la pâte se désintégrait. Trop c'est comme pas assez et ce n'est pas une montagne de cubes de jambon à peine cuits et d'ananas (plus le jus de la boîte de conserve) qui justifient en aucun cas que ce désastre était bon à manger.  Et que dire des prix beaucoup trop élevés?! Clairement ce restaurant désuet ne souhaite d'aucune manière concurrencer sur ses nombreux compétiteurs dans le coin de Vimont. Il prend sa clientèle pour acquis en basant sa réputation sur l'abondance de ses garnitures au détriment d'offrir des deux pour un comme toutes les autres pizzerias de ce genre."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and I really love it. I've tried almost everything on the menu, pizza, chinese food,poutine, salads, sub, pasta, seafood , you name it. My favorites are the all dressed special sub and Vimont special pizza, they are AMAZING. I also enjoy their breakfast menu. The staff is very friendly and the place is nice a cosy. I moved to Toronto and everytime I come to visit my family I always stop by."}
{"text":"Best in Laval. Classic Montreal style pizza. Super fresh ingredients. Perfect crust and fantastic pepperoni.   Hearty pizza that was delivered quickly and hot.   Loved it."}

{"text":"I'll admit.... the first time I ate here it was a complete disaster. Basically, after eating nothing all day I ordered some Hawaiian pizza and immediately afterwards I was very sick. It was not an experience I wanted to repeat!  However, despite caution (I'M RECKLESS PEOPLE, RECKLESS!!!!?!).... I went back and ordered a large pepperoni pizza. Hold my beer folks.....   I'm pleased to report I did not get sick! In fact, it was quite good! The cheese was delightful, the crust perfect and the pepperoni the proverbial cheery on the top... literally a 4.5 star pizza. We ordered in advance and I only had to wait a few minutes for my pickup... after all this place was packed on a Saturday night. I knew this wasn't a place countless people would go to for decades to make them sick.  Perhaps the cheese or the cheap pineapple made me sick the first time around... but I'm glad it worked out this time around. It's like going on a date with someone and having it be a complete disaster but giving that person a second chance (because they're hot!) and having them pleasantly surprise you. At this point, I'm ready to go back for a third date and will immediately adjust my score from a 1 to a 3...   As my opinion of the place will slowly be more positive and their pizzas continually be reliable and delicious, I'll adjust again in the future.    Up to 4 it goes"}
{"text":"J'ai de la chance d'habiter près de la pizzeria, car leurs pizzas sont excellentes! Le service est très courtois et je suis toujours impressionnée par la capacité de mémoire de la dame qui prend les commandes au comptoir. Elle reconnait tout le monde! Un endroit à essayer si vous êtes dans Vimont."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza!! Ingrédients frais et savoureux en plus d'etre tres genereux dans la garniture. On a pris all dress et végétarienne. Vraiment top!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch break with 4 others, this place has been open for quite some time and definitely looked it but not in a dirty way. One problem I noticed though was there was this coat stand rack when you enter and it was an obstacle, I had to sidestep sideways to go through that part. Narrow to walk around a bit and not so wheel chair accessible.  We wanted to check out their pizza pies so we ordered 2 medium pizzas as the waitress said it will be enough for all of us and she was right as they were pretty hefty. We ordered one medium special VIMONT which is basically an all dressed with bacon and onions, and a half and half, one side pepperoni and cheese and the other side vegetarian. For me they definitely had some quality toppings and tasted fresh except for the sauce but it was not bad. I had the special and when a place has their name on it I automatically think it`s their all out or close enough pizza but it really was just an all dressed with bacon and onions. The half and half looked like the chef just threw ingredients wherever.  Now the waitress always served water when needed which is a bonus for me because one pet peeve of mine is running out of the good old H20. One person in our group did not like the fact of having half his slices of pizza full of pepperoni and the waitress argued that everything was OK. I can understand 1 to 3  showing up in his slices of vegetarian pizza because it was a half and half after all but half full of pepperoni's on one slice and 6 everywhere on the other slice, no no!! He brought it up again about the massive amounts of pepperoni's on his half and she kept up the argument that everything is OK while he was moving the topping to show her. Now I know some customers can be mean as all hell and tell lies to have it their way no matter what but when good customers say it`s not good just react logically and not force upon us that everything is fine routine. She was not bilingual which was not a big deal for me but this is Laval?!  I want to rate a bit higher but unfortunately the problem is I feel like maybe I missed my chance when they were good/amazing and who knows perhaps the workers had a shred more of respect and not argue when the food was not done right and make sure it's right, The chef needs more passion in his or her cooking and not throw random hand full of pepperoni's on a half and half because that literately made 5 people not want to come back. I won't rate 1 star solely because the ingredients were good and the bacon was cooked so perfectly.  This to me was an example of setting higher standards from reading reviews on Yelp and growing up and wondering how their pizzas tasted just to be let down from the overall experience."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the world. Been around for ever. Been going there for over 25 years and still has a great tasting pizza. Price is not cheap but worth every penny."}
{"text":"La pizza est bonne, Mais très grasse. Je n'exagère pas en disant qu'il y avait un lac, C'est très sérieux. Elle est arriver et quand j'ai ouvert la boîte j'avais une pizza qui sent très bon, Mais j'avais un lac de gras qui était par dessus toute la garniture d'un bon demi pouce. J'ai du couper et égouter les pointes"}
{"text":"I came here expecting too much biased off of other people's reviews. I almost want to give this place 3 stars but I think it's a bit to high, I would give 2 and a half stars over a 2 stars if I could. The pizza was far from the best \"pizza in Laval\" as some people claimed, maybe it use to be a great place for pizza or maybe when I went it wasn't the same chef. To me it was very disappointing nothing special, very over priced for a medium we paid over 50$ for two.  My father also had a ton of pepperoni on one of his slices of his vegetarian pizza, we asked to have a half pepperoni and have vegetarian pizza and it seemed the chef did not care about the placement of toppings with all that peperoni on the vegetarian slice. We came with a group of 5 and all of us agreed we would not be coming back, it's a real shame because I wanted to like this place but I can't, it has a lot of history and I must of missed my chance when they were  great."}
