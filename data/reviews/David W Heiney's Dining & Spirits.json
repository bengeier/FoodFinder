{"text":"Heiney's is one of our favorites. The mid-week menu is great, the catfish \"fish fry\" on Friday is spectacular, and the fresh-shucked oysters are a rare delicacy -- and less expensive than those sold in restaurants back east!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, first place I ate at here and I thought that I was in big trouble. Food is way overpriced, and I don't know who they're trying to fool with their \"Southern\" food, but it's horrible. Gone back ~3 times and tried different things just to make sure I'm ordering the wrong things. 

Pork chops - Burnt and dry
Big Angry Steak - Not spicy, not very good. 
Friday fish, had the fried cod - forget it, walk down to the bar about 2 blocks down, way better. Way too much batter, and not fried very well.
Spaghetti & Meatballs - meh. Not worth the price, go to Fazoli's, way better.
$2.00 per soda? C'mon it's 2012.

Only redeeming factor here, is they have the Lake Louie Scotch Ale on tap.

As my fiance puts it \"It's pretty sad that I can set pans on fire, and still cook better food than they can\" :("}
{"text":"On a recent trip to enjoy the bountiful farmlands of  Wisconcin, we were drawn to a quaint historic eatery in the old town of Black Earth Wisconcin. Heiney's is one of the original \"supper House\" establishments that still treats its guests as royalty, without being stuffy. The 100 year old building holds some unreal culinary secrets for those who venture off the beaten path, as we did. I was the last one of four that simply could not make up my mind, the selections were so many. From ribs to meatloaf, catfish to shrimp Biloxy, wow. Well we started with famous cheese curds(a wisconcin treat), we fought over the last one. Then there was a char-grilled ribeye, my wife had ribs(loved them), a catfish and of course I had the prime rib.(to die for) At one point an apron wrapped employee was seen in the back garden picking fresh vegy's.(this is too much) All was professionally presented by top notch service staff. The owner and chef were seen pacing the floor to check on us and a full dining room. Oh yeah, don't dare forget the kahlua cake and ask if the guitar guy is on duty."}
{"text":"Yes, it may look like a typical WI supper club on the inside, with the vinyl covered seats and tables, and slightly hokey country decorations (fake ivy and pastels with farm implements on the walls).  But Heiney's has the best steaks in the Midwest--did you hear that Chicago?  

Prices are comparable to a Chicago steak house, but I suspect there is less inflation, due to the quality of the meat.  Last time I went in, I ordered \"Steak Muscoda\": fillet mignon topped with blue cheese and morel mushrooms.  It was superb.

The meals are served with salad, bread and choice of potato.  I recommend the spinach salad with the homemade raspberry vinaigrette.  Chicken and fish are also on the menu, for the non-beef eaters.  I also recommend ordering the crawfish appetizer--spicy and delicious.

A full bar is also inside: wine, beer, and mixed and blender drinks.  

Expect to spend about $30-35 per person."}
{"text":"We have been going to Heiney's for several years. I always order the Shrimp Biloxi (peel & eat shrimp in a Cajun broth) - it is messy but fantastic. My wife had the grilled salmon and said it was very good also. Make sure to check out the dessert tray."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and have a friend who loves it, but I've been there twice and the food was awful. Devils on Horseback is A greasy mess of shrimp cooked in their shells in a spicy sauce. You have to pull the oily shells off with your fingers. There is no way to do this cleanly. The Wisconsin style pork chops I got on my next visit were Raw inside and scorched on the outside--usually a sign of using poorly defrosted meat. The blue cheese was dumped on top (not even melted). On the plus side, the service was very good with personable wait staff, but not good enough to make up for the food. I won't be back for a third trial."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars but \"The Big Angry\" was missing from the menu.  So depressing... However, the Walleye is the best I have ever had, it's pricey but worth every penny. Can't beat Tommy Porters Lake Louie on tap. This place is worth the drive from Madison and has a nice mix.  I personally like my food spicy or blackened and the chef never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I've been to Heiney's a few times now for work-related dinners and I can definitely say it is gem.  Prior to having a holiday party here several years back, I had a couple of friends that swore by this restaurant in Black Earth but unless I was buying shoes I just never found myself out this way.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that we'd all be gathering for dinner and drinks, and my heightened expectations were more than met.  The place is absolutely delightful.  The restaurant is in an old house and meat market on the main drag in Black Earth, with a little parking lot out back.  There are multiple levels and rooms, giving the place a real intimate feeling.  The bar area is located down from the entrance and upper dining room, and is apparently the work area of the old meat market.  There is an addition behind the building off the back end of the bar, making the entire place larger than it appears from the street.  The bar area is comfortable but it's a bit narrow - every time we have a group gather there it's hard to negotiate the tight spaces, and it can be a real challenge to get to the bar to order another one of their multiple Lake Louie taps.  

The first time I dined here I was prepared to order the \"Big Angry\" steak as it had come so highly recommended by a friend, but my experience with this lauded steak was delayed as I saw a chicken with homemade andouille sausage entree that I couldn't resist.  I haven't found the solution yet - this is my favorite entree on the menu.  Having relatives down on the Gulf Coast I have a major weakness when it comes to andouille, and Heiney's homemade sausage was amazing.  The chicken is a bit of an afterthought for me, as I work on the andouille and the dirty rice right off the bat.  The few times I tried other entrees were by no means disappointing.  The \"Big Angry\" is justified in its praise - it is a blackened sirloin served with habanero and a wedge of bleu cheese and it'll require a couple of pints of Lake Louie to wash down.  I also tried a nightly special the last time, Nurnberger sausages from Bavaria Sausage Kitchen, served with sauerkraut.  They were delicious and surprisingly filling.  Also, I saw that they have an appetizer consisting of chicken wings done up with Wundoemus spice, an excellent and versatile WI-made seasoning that I first encountered down in Platteville at Red n Deb's Bar.  Next time I'm there I've got to try this, and I've been coming up with reasons since the last dinner a few months back.

The only downside I've ever had on our repeated trips to Heiney's has been service related.  The servers have all been mostly friendly, with a few exceptions.  I chalk a lot of this up to usually having a decent-sized group, but there have been too many instances of unfilled water glasses and having to go to the bar to get another beer (a necessary item when having the Big Angry).  I also believe the prices here are on the high side - thankfully I've never had to pick up a check.  Even so, I've got no qualms recommending this place for nice dinner out in Black Earth.  I've never been disappointed and I'm happy that I've joined the David Heiney's cheerleading squad."}
{"text":"My wife and I would like to thank the many people who worked for us over the span of 20 years.  You are family and the very reason we lasted as long as we did as an independently owned restaurant.  The five stars are for you.  
Since closing on October 30, 2013 we have missed you and \"key\" customers more than you can imagine....."}
{"text":"This fantastic historic building has great food and no matter what you get 
- Great Ribs, great shrimp (new orleans style), fish ...anything you get, you will like if not love.  The service is awesome too!  When you go ask about the history and be sure to get a seat in the front - it's the old butcher shop."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. A few years back it was a great place to stop when I was in the Madison area. The past two i visited occasions the food was not good at all. I've noticed that the timeline of reviews seems to show a downward trend also."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Service is always spot on, salad greens are grown in their garden and dressings are homemade.  Food is always superb.  We go back again and again."}
{"text":"I have gone twice this week... I dont know why this place would have a bad review.....Marci was our server, she is well versed ,knows the menu, and gave appropriate recommendations... Great service. 
 I had the greek lamb on my first visit.  Wow, it was sooooo good I almost ordered it again on my 2nd visit. Served on a hot steel, with rosemary ( the aroma makes the restaurant smell good). My  2nd visit, We started by sharing a dozen chesapeake oysters, flown in fresh and perfect. Then I put the chef to the test.  I ordered a new york strip steak Pittsburgh style (Black & Blue) .. It was not on the menu.   I described it to Marci, the waitress.  It was DIVINE!  My BF had the prime rib...It was one of the best he ever had. I also had a marinated kale salad, something i have never eaten. Wow, yummy.
The bartender made a perfect Key lime pie martini , which he had never made...I described it, he perfected it with the addition of  ice cream... Super nice.
Fun place - really interesting interiors.  Great ambience.   Great romantic date night  spot.  When comparing the other local  restaurant, this one is heart and hands above...Superior.   I will be back time and  time again while I am here...
BTW- I do not YELP to complain or talk about bad places. I only add remarkable ones to my list..."}
