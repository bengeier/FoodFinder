{"text":"The food here is ok.  The owner is very nice and stopped by a few times to check in.  The food was fresh and most things are made in house.  Chicken tenders were real battered chicken. Its close to home, quick and reasonably priced.  It's not the best however I would return."}
{"text":"Used to be that Starz was a decent, middle of the road family restaurant.  On this visit we saw the beginning of the end.....mediocre food ( seriously, lame burgers, undercooked grilled cheese and nasty chili cheese fries?), plastic utensils (used to be metal flatware) and only one person working the whole restaurant ( horrible service).  Wouldn't call myself a regular but I will call this my last visit.  RIP."}
{"text":"Everything has gotten extremely better. So has their bussiness. People in and out the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times have been very good. As in many small restaurants things are similar skewed."}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep coming back here and giving it another chance.....oh wait!  Yes I do know why.  Only because it's convenient but we will be back no more!  Every time I have been here I've been unimpressed.  Sometimes more than others.  I have ordered a bowl of chili before on a cool night.   I mean, how hard is it to make a pot of chili?  This was definitely a can of Hormel chili.  Every other time I have the burgers, there's nothing wrong with them but there isn't anything right about them either.  Service is below average and almost like they don't want to be there."}
{"text":"Really love this food!  The burgers are great and the portions are really generous.  The new owner and staff are really friendly and quick to serve.  I know that the quality went down about a year ago, but it's back baby!  So glad to have Stars Burgers in Indian Trail as a regular go to for me and the family."}
{"text":"Ive been 3 times and got burgers twice.  First time was really good. But the second ... not so much. Felt like i was eating a brick. 3rd time got a dog and was very pleased. French fries have been awesome every time. Decent atmosphere. Wait staff not very friendly or knowledgeable with the exception of one young lady who has been there since day one. Can't remember her name. but her service is what brings me back."}
{"text":"I've been to Starz many times since they opened and had never had a bad experience, until today.  I should had taken it as a sign when I got there and the entire staff was sitting outside.  When I say the entire staff, I mean the two people working today.  I ordered a Greek salad with extra dressing.  I shouldn't have bothered.  The salad itself was good but the Greek salad dressing was 99% olive oil and a sprinkle of spices.  After getting our order the whole staff, both of them, came out and sat in a booth.  A customer came in and was greeted with \"Hey! Do you know what you want or do you need a minute?\"   Nobody got out of their seat when a \"potential\" customer came in.  I think that he left without ordering anything.  My problem isn't really with the food.  I could have sent it back if I didn't like it. My problem is the lack of respect for the customers and the owners.  I heard one employee tell another customer, who also had a problem with his order, something about having a new owner.  An owner has to spend the time and effort to ensure that his staff knows how to present themselves and the business in a positive manner.  Today's staff apparently don't know how to do that.  To the new owner, Good Luck.  You're gonna need it."}
{"text":"Good food for decent prices.  Great menu and fast service.  Going back again for the next time I am in the mood for a burger!"}
{"text":"I tried out Stars a couple of days after opening and wasn't overly impressed by it.  They were friendly and its clean as it is new, but the food had little flavor.  The fries were a large portion, but they were over salted and cold.  The fries are also that typical generic frozen restaurant style with no flavor to them, almost like the kind you would buy from the frozen section in the grocery store.  The burgers were hot, but again no flavor to them.  We tried the mushroom and swiss and the colossal burger, both of them had a soggy bun texture and little flavor.  The pastrami on the colossal sounded better than it tasted.  All in all, I will give them a second chance after they have been open longer, but I'll take fresh cut peanut fries and their burgers from 5 guys any day over this place.  I hope they tweak their food flavors and maybe they will stay around, Indian Trail could use a non chain burger joint."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a good, juicy, house-made burger from that little burger joint down the street. Unfortunately, Stars is just not the place to find that experience.  We ordered the California Avocado Cheeseburger. The patty was very thin, and cooked to death. It was like a jerky burger. There is a \"secret sauce\" served on the side. It is thousand island dressing, and I was not impressed. It really doesn't even taste good with the other flavors going on in the burger.  Also ordered was the Star's Signature Burger. The burger had so much potential, but again was thin and way too well done.  I have said \"too well done\" a couple of times in this review. Please let me reiterate: These burgers are awful. The meat is dry to the extreme. It is bad. No place that has Burgers in their name should serve burgers of this quality. I'm being harsh because it is simply unforgivable. It would be like going to a sushi restaurant that only served fried fish and didn't have rice.  We also got the onion rings and cajun fries. The fries were not good. Frozen and over-seasoned. Onion rings were thick cut, way too thick cut. The onion really didn't have a chance to cook all the way through, so they were too crunchy. I also got one that hadn't been separated, so it was just half of a fried onion. Not pleasant.  I think the pricing is off also. The signature burger was $6, and didn't come with any sides. The onion rings were $3.69. Zink sells a Wagu burger for $14, that is cooked perfectly every time, served in a dining room with linen, and comes with fries and a pickle. Much better value if you ask me.  The customer service was very friendly. This place has potential, if they can just learn how to cook a burger, find a tasty sauce for the California burger, and adjust their pricing to reflect the quality of their product."}
{"text":"Went here with my family about 2 weeks ago and was a bit disappointed. Although the food was pretty good my stepdad said it was just alright. The total for 3 people to have a meal and a child to have a chicken tender plate was about $40, a bit too much for what we received. The burgers themselves were priced alright (about $5 and change) but to make it a meal with fries and a drink was somewhere around $3! If the price would come down more my review would have been much higher, but other than this I was pretty pleased."}
{"text":"Had the \"special\" burger and it was just o.k.  Burger was a bit dry and needed more sauce. Seasoned fries were just the regular fries with seasoned salt. Not worth the extra charge. Best thing we had were the fried pickles. Veggie patty was nice too."}
{"text":"Got to love my coupons.  I get to use them every time I eat and they force me to try places I never knew existed.    So I take this girl out last night.  1st date.  I give her the option of DIDIS ( I think ) in downtown Monroe,  Burgers,  or Japanese steakhouse.  She jumps all over burgers saying I am turkeyed out and a burger sounds delicious.     coupon says buy one get one.   Sweet.   That will be one double cheese burger, Double the meat, thats right 4 patties, add sauteed onions, mushrooms, swiss and mustard.   The coupon did not say anything about specific burger orders.  Here is where it gets interesting.  This took place last night around 6pm, November 24th.    Cute young girl was working the counter, dark hair, short.  REAL SHORT.   \" hey 5 foot nothing\"    She was the most pleasant respectful counter girl I have come across in a long time.   Nothing but smiles and willing to figure out what I was trying to do with the coupon and totally understood that what I wanted was in no way not allowed per what the coupon said.      She asked the manager and comes back,  \"its for a regular 3.29 burger.\"   wrong!    I argue she tries really hard to figure out a way to get me what I want without going back to the manager.    This right here,  this is customer service at its finest.    Kudos to you counter girl.     You knew the coupon didnt say I couldn't order the biggest burger on the menu and get something of equal or lesser value and you were trying to do the right thing.    That is customer service.      She has to get the manager.   She didn't have the code.    My opinion she has enough brains to be able to have a discount code so she doesn't have to bother the manager.    Hell she seemed to not only have enough brains but the personality and professionalism.  (kinda wish I owned a joint in Indian Trail,  I would have poached her on the spot.)  So Kokos, Kolos, Ko something comes up, steps behind the counter and takes my order.     \" Double cheese burger, Double Meat ( holding up 4 fingers ), delete everything, add sauteed onions, mushrooms, swiss and mustard,   Zucchini fries, O rings, two drinks, and what ever she would like.....)   bam done  $11 and change.   God I love coupons.  Now  you would think the O ring and zucchini fries would have come out fairly instant,  nope they came with the burgers.  no biggie.   Counter girl brings the food and Damnit all to hell!!!   There are only 2 freaking patties on this thing.    4!!  I freaking order 4 patties.  I was looking forward to this burger all the way from Southpark.  30 min ride thinking about this monster burger and I get this half monster burger.     The poor counter girl was like,  OMG  you ordered 4 patties, I heard you and saw you raise four fingers.  My date said the same thing.   Counter girl, \" Please let me take it back for you and fix it.\" \"hell no!  Nobody is going to drop my patty on the ground or spit on it\"  I check the receipt with her and wasn't charge for the double meat.    I told counter girl not to worry, I want her to have a pleasant evening and it's really not that big of a deal.  I forget about it and eat.     Burgers are a bit flat but you are getting 1/4 lb patties,  but there were juicy.  Onion, mushrooms sautéed perfect.    Buns are way too big for the patties in my opinion.   I am not a big fan on bread.  I prefer to see the meat before the bun.     Now,  Here is the high point.   The onion rings and zucchini fries,  were they fresh or frozen bc I could have sworn they were homemade.    very very good.   Zucchini was not soggy, still crisp and so were the onion.   That credit can go to the cook for making sure the oil was hot and they were not in for too long.      Ranch dressing = homemade Ice T  =  brewed not pasteurized. Decor =  exactly what I expected, clean typical burger joint Service = other than Koko no paying attention to my order,  perfect  overall the experience was a 4 star for sure.  Thanks counter girl for the friendly smiles and service."}
{"text":"Good food and great service!  The zucchini fries were very good.  A hidden nugget in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"Burgers were cooked perfectly. Tasted like it was grilled in the backyard. Owner was super friendly and the restaurant was super clean. Prices were a bit high on first glance, but after eating the burger- totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Under new management since November of 2014. They have defiantly stepped up from what they were before. I'm always welcomed when I come and catered to as if I was the only customer there. You can tell that they are using fresh ingredients and meat! I had the special kabobs twice and both times were very good!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership who changed the fries to yummy shoestring fries. Burger is big and tasty. Unfortunately gyros are off the new menu."}
{"text":"My burger was just okay. I wouldn't go running through the streets shouting about it. The reason for the 3 stars is my wife loved her Carolina burger, so maybe that's the way to go.   The service was some of the friendliest you'll ever come across. (another reason for 3 stars)"}
{"text":"The new owner does not honor any coupons from the Go Play Save coupon books, even though the name of the restaurant is the same. He advertises \"fresh vegetables\" and has nothing but a salad for vegetables. We did not order the combo with fries and a drink and he charged us for it and acted like we ordered it when we clearly did not want that. The portion of fries we got with the combo was child size. I asked him why he wouldn't honor the $5 off of $20 and he said it took all of his profit. I told him he would gain new customers by honoring the coupon and he still didn't care. He did end up taking off 10% of the check, $2.80, he could have just honored the measly $5 and gained a family of four to his business, but for the $2.20 he saved in profit, he lost this family's business. Word of mouth dude, do the right thing!"}
{"text":"Ask Hossein about his unposted Persian menu.  We went in tonight for burgers, but tonight... 100% lamb with saffron rice and a roasted tomato. My husband had the whole Cornish hen. Was fabulous. Everything was made to order so took awhile, but worth the wait. The hospitality is like nothing you'll experience in the typical restaurants. This owner cares what we think and aims to please. Go to their Facebook page for a real peek of the Persian food they serve. You can also get the burgers and chicken if you're not into ethnic food."}
{"text":"NEW OWNER!! Very nice man and his staff are very friendly. They are concerned about the poor reputation this restaurant had before, and are doing everything to rectify it.  The menu has been trimmed down and they focus mainly on burgers and salads. I am GF and had the California burger w/o the bun-it was freshly made and no one blinked an eye about the request.  The fries are thin and crispy and the portion is generous.  This is a storefront restaurant hidden in the Food Lion shopping mall across from Bruesters ice cream. They have three storefronts so it has a large seating area, good for parties or after the kids games as a meet-up.  They even take AmEx!"}
{"text":"Was excited to eat here and the first time I thought it wasn't a bad place for burgers.  I went there a second time and ordered the same thing (Cali Avocado Burger).  The avocado this time was so raw you couldn't even bite into it.  This was the last time I went, and will probably be the last time since I wasn't too impressed the first time and certainly not happy the second time.  There are much better burger joints in the area."}
