{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this location! It's very spacious which is great! We ordered the chicken on the rocks and a phillychicken sandwich. The rocks were nice and saucey, just be cautious the hot sauce is super spicy! I was told their philly chicken is amazing, and I definitely wasn't disappointed! It's probably my new favourite, since it adds a cheesy twist to the regular chicken shawarma (which is also pretty good)."}
{"text":"The place is really big and has some nice TVs inside. The food and service on the other hand were awful. Came in early afternoon and after placing my order it took them over 5 minutes before they even started making it and close to 15 minutes before receiving my chicken Shawarma wrap. After tasting the wrap it tasted how I imagine cardboard would taste. The chicken was really dry, the wrap was really hard to chew. Overall I highly recommend NOT going here."}
{"text":"First time at this Osmow's and ordered a medium half & half chicken shawarma.  Portion was a lot smaller than I expected.  For $9.25 + tax I expected more.  The chicken was extra lemony and shredded up so much it was like someone chewed up already.  I asked for mild and got 3 little dots of hot sauce.  3 dots? For this price they could've at least given me a full line.  I ordered it to-go so I didn't know until I got home.  Garlic sauce was good - that's about it.  I won't be back (at least not to this location)"}
{"text":"Slow service, small portions. Ordered chicken on the rocks and it was dry with little sauce. Asked the male teenage looking server politely to add more sauce and he replied with telling me I had to pay an extra 20 dollars with a serious face. Smh. I then had to remind them that I ordered my meal with extra chicken and he replied that another 20 dollars needed to be paid. Maybe funny the first time, but the second time was not appreciated, no time for fun and games when the order was almost completely wrong. Never going back to this location. I'll stick to Lazeez, thanks."}
{"text":"The quality of their shawarma is 10x better then any other location. Always busy so make sure you go during nonpeak time. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"MOST DELICIOUS SHAWARMA IN THE CITY! Love this place. The chicken shawarma is amazing and their garlic sauce is mouth watering.   Would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"You guys, what is going on with this place. I get that school is out and young people need some work but wtf maybe improve the interview process. Stepped to the counter to order and was met with a cashier that was completely out of her element. Like, a combination of apathy and hair. Just long hair everywhere, man. I didn't give it much thought so I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. She asked me what size I wanted. There was no size noted on the menu. I pointed to the menu and said just give me the first thing on the menu. It's $13.95. The first thing. On the menu. It's right there. No size. This went on for a while. Eventually one of her colleagues stepped in and sorted things out.   We sat down and waited for our food. Someone walked in, no uniform, stepped behind the counter, started preparing food. I will say that dude got shit done and good for him but he didn't wash his hands before the food handling activities.   So, the food. It was aggressively average. But at that point the lead up that included cousin it, mr no soap, and what I'm sure are several other health code violations, the thrill was gone.   In conclusion, maybe go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Massive seating area, unlike any other osmow's I've been too! Food is good ! Chicken on the rocks hits the spot ! Medium spice is more than enough ! Prefer it to lazeez !"}
{"text":"We eat at Courtneypark's Osmows often so we thought this Heartland one would be good too.  Unfortunately their chicken isn't as chopped up or well-cooked as Courtneypark's. We found at least a handful bone fragments in each of our Chicken on the Rocks, so be careful! It seems they're a bit stingy on the white sauce too.  Will continue to go to Courtneypark location, but this is the last time we visit the Heartland one."}
{"text":"Don't even consider going to the place. Prices are the same but portions are half size. I don't think is the same osmows. I have never put 1 star on a place but my recommendation for whoever reads this is to drive extra 5 km and go to another Osmows place because you will be disappointed.  I see that i am not the only one writing a bad review."}
{"text":"I stopped by today at 11:45AM.  This place is supposed to be open at 11:00AM and they are still closed.  Osmow's should update their hours of operation."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place 0.5 starts or less.  To start the girl at the counter has no idea what she is doing. Second the food was not good. The falafel were way over cooked and the fries were undercooked. My husband's shawarma was not filled up like Courtney park does. We haven't gone to this location since this incident and I don't think we ever will."}
{"text":"Their portion sizes aren't as good as other locations and tend to be way smaller with less garlic sauce. I've came here a couple times and they're always out of tzatziki sauce and other ingredients needed in their wraps. The people that work here are pretty nice but that doesn't justify the food."}
{"text":"Ok, first I saw at least 5 health violations while waiting.  Example: Guy making Wraps with bare hands also touching register and other shared utensils with others, never washing.   Place is dirty.  Tables filled with crumbs door and windows have hand prints all over them looks like they have not been cleaned in weeks.   Shawarma very average.   Going to take a shower now."}
{"text":"This is the first time I came to this location. I have been to their other ones before but this one is much bigger than the others.   On first glance, it looked brand new with bright interiors. When we placed our order, we saw that the person who took our order did not wash his hands before making our chicken shawarma. Yuck! He also put onions in our shawarma when we specifically asked to not put that in.   Overall, the prices were fair, the food was okay and the portions were average. I might visit this location again as it is very convenient and their prices are okay."}
{"text":"New osmow in heartland. The place is huge. Really good for group gatherings. Food was good. The food portion is smaller than the one in courtney park. We took a large portion and it was a regular size chicken on the rocks. Pretty disappointed with that. I wasn't the only one who noticed that Not so tempting for a second visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is huge! Chicken on the rocks...their version is ok. It hits the spot but I've had better ones. I've also noticed that there's a lot of people waiting for their orders for a long time and Osmows has a lot of employees. There's shouldn't be any reason for such a long wait  The reason I gave them 2 stars: 1. I got burnt pieces of dried chicken 2. They charge you for extra garlic sauce when other places give you unlimited sauce for free 3. The chicken were not chopped uniformly, I've got 3 big ones and the rest were super small  chicken. So disappointing. 4. Most of the tables were not clean, they need to put some employees on the floor vs. Kitchen  I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Osmows. I always got the half half chicken (with rice and fries) from the Streetsville location before this one opened up closer to home. Before they changed their boxes, they use to have the typical white styrofoam take out box. I would get the regular size and the box was PACKED full. So much I could break it down into three separate meals! Now, that the boxes are changed into the paper, I order a regular and box is not even half way full of rice, chicken or fries. ONTOP of that, the guy asked me if I wanted extra garlic sauce, I said sure because I never have been offered that option, he charged me 75 cents for literally an extra LINE of sauce.... what a waste of money. I truly love this dish but I will try Lazeez next time. Not worth the $10-11 anymore. MAYBE max a $7 meal for the amount you get."}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated with Egyptian theme and bright colours. Quite specious. Ample parking space in the plaza.   Food quality... I would give it 2.5 star at max.  We had Beef Swarma sandwich and Falafel Plate. The Swarma was ok, but something was not right with the Felafel, it tasted really bitter!! Not recommended."}
{"text":"You might as well go to courtney park osmos and get your moneys worth. You pay the same money and get half the portion here."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch time. Only 3 staff was present. Ordered at 13:21, got served by 14:08. This is the worst wait time ive ever had for a mid eastern food. The cashier girl is useless and should be fired. Too long to take orders, and doesn't help the other two guys doing prep and the food. She just take orders and cant do anything, one staff said she doesn't know how to do the orders. People are piling and waiting for food for more than 30 mins. The owner came in past 2pm and went straight to the kitchen, hygiene is very bad, he doesnt even wear gloves. I hope he washed his hands. Dont go to this place if you're hungry. Not even a 2nd choice place if the nearby restos are full too. Horrible."}
