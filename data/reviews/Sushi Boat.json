{"text":"So disappointing. Years ago when they reno'd I had high hopes their kitchen, service and management would  get better but alas...we were in Friday at supper time  and there were more than 6 boats in a row EMPTY! and other scattered boats Empty! The boats that did have product had maybe 1-2 items. We ended up ordering from the server and that took forever. The whole idea of the boats is to be able to take off the boats. They should be full all through mealtimes one would think? And if the boats were full people would actually eat more or try other items just because they're there and easy to grab. It's sad because they have quality fish but it's just so frustrating. If I wanted to order off a menu I'd go to Kinjo! Parking is way to difficult now too with all the reserved stalls for less popular businesses. Conclusion - you can do better..."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Nothing really stands out but it was good for the price. Fun experience to bring my son for his first Sushi experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Sushi here. The boats are super cute and they fill them up as fast as you take stuff. Twice I have been here at opening and was 1 person from getting a table so I've had to wait. The wait was worth it though.

Sushi is fresh. There's a fair amount of items that are familiar. I also like the little cream puff plates and the plates of fruit which is a nice way to refresh the palate.

Usually spend about 40 bucks here and I typically split the meal with my friend. We come all the time and really enjoy coming. It's always super busy though so look out for people in the parking lot. We will keep coming back when ever I'm in the NW for now I'll stick with Kinjo but this another great alternative."}
{"text":"When I went here I wasn't expecting much - food isn't always #1 at sushi boats/trains - but it's actually really good.

We had a flurry of plates from the boat, and everything except for one nigiri with nothing but crumbled tempura flakes in it (not to my taste) was delicious. Also enjoyed the tiny bowls of udon soup."}
{"text":"Make sure to get to Sushi Boat early to beat the crowd! For a quick meal on the cheap side, in and out within 30 minutes, this place is perfect. Not what I'd recommend for a quiet date or anything, but fun nonetheless. I've always found the quality and freshness to be acceptable as well. I know they do take-out orders at Sushi Boat, but have never tried it. Sounds like it would be a tasty night in!"}
{"text":"I go here ALL the time and love it.  Pretty good sushi and it's definitely the best I've ever had for the price.  As far as the rice and noodle bowls go, you can get the same amount of food for cheaper at Szechuan Express, but it is nowhere near as good in quality.  I am a big fan of Sushi Boat's bento boxes (they advertise them on the dry erase board inside); you get a heck of a lot of food (rice bowl, 3pc California roll, 3pc shumai) for the price ($8) and will definitely have enough left over for another meal.

Just a side note: this place is a little cramped if you are planning to eat upstairs during the lunch rush so keep this in mind if you're coming with a larger group."}
{"text":"Philadelphia roll is delicious, tamago is tasty as well. I'd say that this is the best place for sushi in Oakland. The rice dishes are nothing special though, Taiwan Cafe or Szechuan Express would be better places to go to but if you want sushi, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi, but not very good. The rolls fell apart and the wasabi was really low quality. I also found a tiny mite in my ginger."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem!

Can't beat prices for sushi and Chinese food, and the best thing to happen to Oakland since Taiwan Cafe shut down a few years back. 

Owners are very friendly, great prices, great taste! Don't go anywhere else in Oakland or you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. No frills, no pleasantries at the register. A great quick lunch stop. I will say, the sushi is the main attraction here. I've also had non-sushi things that were mediocre, but the sushi is always good."}
{"text":"I wish it was possible to give half star-ratings. If so, I'd give Sushi Boat 2.5 stars. While the food is not horrible, it's not great either. I go to sushi boat whenever I want a quick meal and I don't feel like driving downtown for real authentic sushi. The food at Sushi Boat is OK. They have quite the extensive menu of sushi and rolls but some of them aren't very good. If you are used to authentic, high quality sushi, here's what I suggest from the menu that's half decent and actually even quite good sometimes:

- seared salmon (quite yummy!)
- himachi (yellowtail)
- toro (belly of tuna)
- rainbow roll (my favourite! actually one of the better ones in Calgary)
- special scallop
- yam tempura

some of the other, such as the regular salmon, tuna, red tuna, scallop, mackeral, etc. are ok. They've got some weird ones like corn sushi that I didn't care for. The house special roll wrapped with egg didn't look appetizing at all, nor their teriyaki salmon sushi. Like I say, some of this stuff is VERY westernized and sometimes I can't believe they can even dream of certain menu items.

The prices aren't cheap. Most of the items that I recommended above are at least around $3.50 or more for a dish of 2 pieces (rolls being 4 pieces).  While the prices aren't exoberant, they are pricey enough and it's easy to spend around $25 to $30 for a modest eater. And for that price, I can have a pretty decent meal at a more authentic Japanese restaurant such as Wa's."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in Oakland; period. Huuuuuge portions, super cheap ($6.15 for the picture I uploaded of sweet&sour) and just overall amazing, typical chinese food. Great sushi, too!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place to eat at when Im in the NW part of town. You dont have to wait long for food. Sit down and grab what you like as the boat comes chugging along. Great staff and good price."}
{"text":"Terrible, preparation was sloppy, taste was mediocre.
Sushi rolls fell apart."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Calgary! Been coming here for years and the food has always been amazing and really affordable! The fish is always fresh and the service is nice. If you're in the NW this is a must stop for fine Japanese cuisine"}
{"text":"You order downstairs and pay at the register, and they bring the food to your seat which is upstairs.  

The sushi is good, and the other rice and noodle bowls are very good.  It's a great fast and cheap way to get a good meal, never had any complaints.

On a side note, the owner is always there and super friendly, making sure to thank you every time you leave and even taking the time to learn his frequent customer's names. Very refreshing"}
{"text":"My go-to for a quick sushi fix. Always enjoy the conveyer-belt boat-riding sushi. Fun, tasty and you don't have to wait. Sushi is good, perhaps not the best in the city, but it's tasty and reasonable. Service is efficient and the green tea is quite delicious. 

For those who are more price-concious, sushi is all presented on colour-coded plates, so it's easy to nab what you like and stay within a budget."}
{"text":"I only really tried this place because oishi bento was closed after a fire a few weeks back. This place was pretty disappointing. The rolls were flavorless. . . I couldn't even taste the rice, just the freezing cold cucumbers that they cram in everything. Even less delicious than the rolls was the sesame cold noodle appetizer which involved tough noodles with a few strands of shaved carrot and cucumber, some sesame seeds and a little solo cup of peanut butter. Not very good and even more hungry than I was when I got there :("}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've had in my life... Undercooked rice, rolls falling apart, canned tuna in the house special roll tasted like cat food. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm around my 'hood and feeling a sushi 'hit', I typically head down to Sushi Boat to satisfy my craving! :-)

While I wouldn't classify Sushi Boat as a sushi destination, they have been serving up quality sushi for over 10 years. I stay with the tried, tested and true sushi and away from the westernized stuff. The pricing is fair when you compare it to some of the other sushi joints in town.

Think of Sushi Boat as your go-to spot in the neighbourhood when you need a 'hit'. 

Other comments:
+1 for an authentic Japanese owned and operated joint
-1 for the long lines
+1 for quick in-and-out meal"}
{"text":"Sushi is good but prices have goten higher. I do love the sweet soy sauce but find i go other places now for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Sushi boat offers decent, but definitely not spectacular, sushi at a good price.  The service is pretty quick and it's a nice place to stop off for food.

The staff here is friendly, and the atmosphere clean and simple.  I wouldn't get too excited about some of their house special sushi types, they do the traditional rolls decent enough."}
{"text":"The food was alrite, coming from bc it was not upto par, and also a bit pricy. It is pretty good for a calgary location but im a bc boy and so this makes it decent"}
{"text":"Our attempt to dine at Kinjo Dalhousie was a failure due to a massive line up out the door, we decided to head to Sushi Boat. Upon filling out the waiting list (there was only a few names ahead of us) there was a huge crowd of people in the front foyer and I wasn't too sure how quickly we were gonna get in. After 30 grueling minutes, we were seated at the bar. 

I like that they have the boats rotating by with sushi plates stacked on top, it's kind of a \"choose your own adventure\" and it's different than the other sushi places in town. However, since I'm not a huge tuna fan I really have to inspect what's going by and it can be a little frustrating when you're hungry. (You do have the option to just order off the menu too, it's just quicker with the floating boats)

The sushi is fresh for sure, the chefs are smiling and laughing as they work and the servers are quick to clear off tables so people can shuffle in and out as quickly as possible.

I think the space they have for their front desk and back/side section (where they have a cooler for pops and storage) could be used more efficiently. It takes up about half the place - you could easily use that area to set up more tables.

I would probably be back, I do like it here. I just don't like the long waits - and eating dinner super early or super late to avoid the rush doesn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Favorite Asian cuisine in Oakland. The service is usually pretty quick, the sushi is great, and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Small place, typically this means the best food can be found here. Sadly this was not the case. Not the best but not the worst. I purchased the Beef noodle soup bowl and it was very plain. Good portion size and very fast service though."}
{"text":"Nostalgic is how I would describe Sushi Boat. Sure its a little cheesy with the plates placed on boats constantly circling on the conveyor. And sure there is a door above the toilet in the men's washroom. But, ultimately while sitting down at Sushi Boat I am reminded of the kaiten sushi places frequented during my life in Japan. Only here the sushi is 3 times the price!

I consider this place an authentic kaiten experience. The chefs are indeed Japanese sushi chefs. I know this because my company this visit is Japanese who worked in the industry and knew some of the chefs. I even enjoyed taking my bill to the front register to pay, the practice in Japan. I like the pricing variety offered in case you have a budget. I like that this place is very Japanese.

Just a couple of tips. The sushi has wasabi between the fish and the rice. Keep that in mind in case you put a healthy dollop of wasabi on your sushi and make your mouth explode. Also, never take from the boats always order from the waitress! And when you're done be sure to say O-kanjo-onegaishimasu! Yay Sushi Boat!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was about 16!  I love the style of the floating boats because you don't have to constantly flag someone down and you can start eating immediately. Their udon soup is yummy... they add bits of tempura in it- yum! I've tried the California rolls, tuna and salmon nigiri, eel rolls and seared salmon- all delish. I like the cans of pop opposed to fountain, much tastier. The coloured plates make it easy to keep track of price.

I go at lunch a lot, but tonight I came for dinner and noticed they made people wait until their parties were present... which is awesome when busy, but the bar was empty aside from me and two others so I would've been annoyed to have kept waiting! They're great at serving single diners though, they always squeeze me in so I can get my sushi fix! But if you come at a busy time on a busy night, expect to wait a while... (seems worth it to me for the food).

Ps- you can take from the boats or request any menu item you don't see floating from the menu!"}
{"text":"It's fine for what it is.  Cheap decent sushi.  Prices are pretty good with 2 salmon nigiri (sake) on a plate for I think around 3.50 if I remember right.  Its not the best sushi but for the most part its fresh and reasonably well put together.  I try to order rather than waiting for the boats as you can watch certain things go around and around for a while.  

A good place to swing by for an evening snack or a late dinner as its convenient."}
{"text":"We went to Sushi Boat yesterday for a late lunch. We were a party of three and the food was well done. No complaints there. The menu was decent and the price + value was good.

Two complaints: cheap, weak plastic cutlery and only having one employee available to handle the aftermath of the lunch rush.

1. Plastic cutlery - I can see the value for a restaurant in having plastic cutlery, however the cutlery used here is the cheapest flimsiest crap you can buy. It breaks easily and it flexes too much. I took my Grandma here and she needed to use the cutlery as she was unable to use the chopsticks. This cheap cutlery made things much more difficult for her.


2. We arrived sometime around 1:15 pm. At that time there were two employees working but when we were ready to order our second round of dishes there was only one waitress available! She was actually running inside the restaurant to keep up with the customers demand. Hinako was absolutely fantastic but she was clearly over worked. Really disappointed here... she was doing all she could but another employee would have definitely helped.


Overall, enjoyed the meal here. My son loved the boats."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall. You could wish it looked/felt nicer, but that would detract form its aura. (Visit Sushi Fuku, right next door, if the ambience bothers you.) But some buffalo chicken 'sushi' and great dumplings just can't be beat.

Disclaimer: I am a dumpling snob. This is one of three places in Pittsburgh I have found with A) plump (if small) dumplings and B) flavorful, tangy sauce. The other two are New Dumpling House in Squirrell Hill and and Hong Kong Express II Downtown."}
{"text":"Underrated place with extremely affordable sushi! 

I ordered two portions of alaskan roll (avocado + salmon) for only $8 , that's 16 pieces of sushi! 

Sushi tasted very fresh and I feasted like a king! 

It might not be very popular due to it's outward appearance, but food wise it is a home run!"}
{"text":"Sushi Boat always seems busy--I had to queue up to get a seat along the sushi canal--which one would think is excellent in terms of freshness.  I mean, the sushi won't be on the boats very long with such a crowd.  The reality of my Friday night visit partly proved the freshness hypothesis: the sushi I got WAS fresh and tasty. . . but the boats, more often than not, floated by empty.  It seemed a few of the tables around the room were ordering off the menu, and the menu orders seemed to receive priority, so the boats suffered with both poor variety and poor load factors.  And with near-empty boats and selection in the single digits in terms of variety, the novelty of sitting and facing a sushi canal quickly dissipates.
Terrific idea--great fun--and perhaps an off night?  I would make it a port of call again for the novelty, and hopefully variety would climb aboard as well."}
{"text":"Mmmm....    been a regular of Das Boot for many years.  And I have always been fascinated that Japanese culture seems to find a way of making something wierd, something cool. 

Tonight's experience was fantastic as always.    Arrived at the tail end of the dinner rush at about 6pm, seated in 10 min and given great service.   Service 5 by 5.

Food.   Yum!   Fresh and tasty as always, great variety on the boats floating by in the stainless steel river.  Food 4 by 5.

I wish they would bring back the sunomono!"}
{"text":"Very good, reasonably priced sushi. The only \"con\" is that they hardly speak English there, so it might be frustrating if you try to ask them a question about the food."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place. We work for UPMC and we come here for lunch all the time and the food is excellent every single time. This place is definitely a hole in the wall, so don't expect 5-star ambiance, but the food is definitely 5-star taste! My favorite is the sweet potato tempura rolls!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi. Very affordable prices, and a nicely varied menu.

I tend to stick with vegetarian sushi rolls so I can't comment on the quality/freshness of the seafood.

The bento boxes are a good deal. ~$8 for a box with rice, your choice of meat/veggie and sauce, a few pieces of California roll, and a few pieces of shumai. We've asked for extra pieces of California roll (cucumber roll for me) instead of the shumai and they've been very accommodating. 

There is a bit of a wait no matter where you intend on eating but you can't beat Sushi Boat's consistently good quality food at these prices!"}
{"text":"Sushi Boat, oh how you have disappointed me in the past few months. Ever since Taiwan Café closed, I have been relying on you for my dosage of Americanized Chinese food. We used to be so good for each other. I put in my 6 bucks, and you give me crispy general tso's chicken...drenched in saucy goodness. 

But recently, you've changed. I still contribute my part, but you don't take us seriously anymore. I ask for general tso's chicken, you give me outdated, soggy chicken in some sloppy sauce. I ask for sesame chicken, you give me outdated, soggy chicken in some sloppy sauce with a few sesame seeds sprinkled on top. See what I mean? 

I don't think this relationship will work out. It is time we go our separate ways--and my way is towards more quality food. Farewell, Sushi Boat."}
{"text":"I really like this place.
It is unique that the sushi is floating on boats and it goes past you.
It gives you the oppertunity to pick and see what you want also not bad price"}
{"text":"This was my first time being at a revolving sushi restaurant.  There were various items placed on plates which sat on 'boats' that floated in a circular fashion.  The tables were situated next to the 'river' and patrons would grab the dishes that they wanted.  There was also the option to order from a menu if you don't see a particular item.  Different colored dishes had different prices.  At the end, all the plates are counted and you end up with your bill.

Atmosphere: 3/5 It was apparently quiet for a Saturday night according to some of the staff. There were several tables. We were a group of 6 and sat at one of the end tables.  Plenty of parking in a strip mall.  Overall satisfactory.

Food:  3/5 Overall satisfactory.  There were some standard items such as white / red tuna, salmon, salmon belly, shrimp, squid, yellowfin sushi; not that many rolls though - salmon skin, house special roll; edamame beans, interestingly cream puffs and jello.  We had to order some special ones like scallop, unagi and there were no sashimi.  Maybe because we were at the end of the revolving table but we found that a lot of the items kept repeating and some of the ones we wanted were grabbed before we had a chance.  Nevertheless we were able to order from the menu and the food arrived promptly.

Service: 4/5  Good overall.  We were promptly seated when the restaurant opened at 5pm sharp; water filled frequently and food arrived quickly when we made special orders

Price: 3/5  Reasonable.

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall good experience and met my expectations; I would come again but maybe at a busier time since the staff stated that as it gets busier, there would be more variety of items made and placed on the boats.  Good to try at least once and learn about the different types of sushi / sashimi / rolls and other items!"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Fun atmosphere.  I really like their udon soup as well.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"great place to dine! I I love the concept of actually being able to see the food float past you before actually selecting it. 
the atmosphere is very relaxed, and it really helps one unwind
I wish they would have a better sign in system,  but thankfully on the other hand the wait times are never too long. 
The staff are really attentive, and are always ready to describe the rolls with those who are unfamiliar with sushi. 

Tip
- don't just take what's on the boats. there are some super popular dishes that get snatched up right away, so you're left with the less popular dishes. Dare to order off the menu!
- don't hesitate to ask the staff what each roll is made of, they're extremely helpful!
- when you're signalling for a staff member, raise your hand up high. It's only fair!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in my top,  good sushi at a great price.  Some unique pieces as well.  The salmon and tuna pizza rolls,  deep fried rice,  fresh sushi on top with chopped onions and to bike.  Delicious! 

There is better sushi in town but it can come with a hefty price tag,  if you're after value check out this joint!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Loved it for years and years, and continue to. It gets extremely busy around the dinner time and the waits can get a little long, so I'd suggest going a bit earlier or later especially if you're quite hungry as the wait can be a bit much. But it's so nice to just reach out and grab what you need, and all of the plates are at such a good price too. If there's something you want that you don't see, the servers come to you and take your order within minutes! Awesome food here."}
{"text":"MMM sushi. I've been coming to here for a long time, my brother first introduced me to this place and I would drive across the city just because it's so good!

It is always busy, so keep that in mind, but it's usually pretty quick (less than 30 minutes). They have tables, booths and the bar, so if you aren't too picky you should be able to get a spot quick. 

They have lots of selection, as well as, the boat that goes around. Pleasant servers and friendly sushi chefs. 

They also do take out, which is nice if you want to grab and eat at home."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant! I've been to Globefish, blowfish, towa, Kawa, Hana, chopsticks, sushi motto, Yamato and many others. Consistently this sushi boat has the best sushi!:) Not to mention the best price as well:)... Sure their rolls r not that fancy - but I crave for them every time after trying other places... Especially their rainbow rolls.. Simply the best."}
{"text":"Price has increased quite a bit since my visit from last year, and the portions (sushi size) are substantially smaller.  They did have some new menu items but they are consistently out of sea urchin (uni) every. single. freakin'. time. I go there.  Doesn't matter what time of the day, what day of the week.

Also very sad when you ask for the bill and the server comes up to tell you to not give a tip because they don't get a single cent of it.  Apparently the owner takes it all."}
{"text":"Omg.

Coworker: \"Want to come with me for cheap sushi?\"

Me (*thinking 'I packed a lunch today, but how can I say no to sushi?'*): \"Sure!\"

Good decision on my part.

Please tell me where else you can go that you can find 16 pieces of sushi for less than $7.. I'll wait. 

I ordered an avocado cucumber roll and the sweet potato tempura roll (8 pieces each)... SO good. First of all, I'm really impressed with the simple fact that they do not use dyed pickled ginger, which a lot of cheap sushi places do (ginger is not really pink, people!). The wasabi is pretty good, but not as strong as REAL wasabi. The most important detail though- the sushi. AMAZING. Seriously, the sweet potato tempura roll is like my favorite thing ever. I also love the simplicity of the avocado cucumber roll, and the ingredients tasted really fresh to me. The first time I visited was last Wednesday and I have returned 2 additional times since then. Yeah, the obsession is real. 

As for the other important details of this place- the inside is small, so I recommend take-out. Keep in mind my review is strictly for the vegetarian options, I cannot speak for the freshness of their fish or other seafood options. They have plenty of other options besides sushi- they have noodles, rice bowls, soups, salads, etc. But when you go, get the sweet potato tempura roll. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Calgary because they are always friendly staffs,FREE GREAN TEA!!
And they are not expensive than other sushi restaurants.and good quality as well.
I usually go by myself and have 10 dishes for $30.super full always content.
There's green tea ice cream is rich taste!try it :D"}
{"text":"I ordered eight pieces of California rolls. It's only less than $4. The rice was soft and it's just perfect! Can't go wrong with this."}
{"text":"The sushi is a little pricey, but the quality is above average.  There is always a line up to get in.  I am surprised that there is not more 'rotating sushi bar' type restaurant in Calgary, because customers turnover is so high with this type of restaurant... once you are seated, there is no long wait to order food and wait for the food to get there. To get the fresh sushi, you are better off ordering from the waiting staff and just getting the dishes from the boats.  Rice tends to turn hard when it has been sitting out for a little while."}
{"text":"It's the first restaurant with conveyor sushi I ever seen in Calgary. the sushi here looks fantastic and tastes good. The quality is excellent. The secret menu is a good chance for us to make up something we want. Like deep fried cream puff, something like that, everything u would like to make, and they can make it. Then you can enjoy your own unique meal."}
{"text":"I too have loved Sushi Boat for many years, always providing a quick sushi fix when needed, the best fast food you can get.  However lately the shine is off the apple.  Routinely you need to wait for a table or a place at the bar, not always convenient when dining with friends. There is a foul smell in the air as soon as you walk in.  This I've noticed my last 3 visits.  The boats are routinely empty or only offer the basics forcing you to order offer the menu, if you can get someone's attention.

Avoid the uninformed crowd and save your time and appetite.  This restaurant has forgotten what had drawn us in when they first opened.  Come on Sushi Boat you can do better, get it together."}
{"text":"I found their sushi ok. a little pricey but it's the better one in this area. sakana grill is just garbage.  just wish their uni can go on sale forever! that's all I eat there."}
{"text":"I love the boats carrying sushi that travel around the restaurant...  I rarely get to eat from the boats as I don't eat fish and order from the menu - but I love that they are there in concept. I secretly do get a dessert more often than not because I want to use the boats and there will be a thing of cream puff or something out.  As far as the rest of the ambiance, I also quite like the water feature and cranes they have too.  

We eat here a fair bit - and would likely go more often if it wasn't for the LONG line that forms at certain prime times.

The one thing I appreciate most about Sushi Boat is they consider people like myself on team veg (no fish).  If you check out the menu on the placemat they have a whole section of veggie friendly options.  The don't have any \"fancy\" sushi for veggies (or really in general) but they have the standards and then expand a bit beyond standard.  Like, they have pickled radish and some kind of mushroom roll which are not found everywhere but also not overtly unique or anything.   When you order from the menu,  the rolls are out very quickly.    Often after sitting,  I've ordered within 5 minutes (delays are because you're deciding, not the staff!),  had enough time to snag a plate of cream puffs to eat first (hehe) and my rolls are starting to come out sometimes before my plate of 5 puffs are gone - which is excellent.   The delay at SB is getting a seat - not in eating. 

SB works on the colored plate system starting at $2 for a red plate with about 3 pieces usually.  Most of my veggie items are $2 - the nothing notable exception I can think of is avocado roles that I think are $3 (maybe $2.5).   Silver or Gold plates are some of their fancier roles and that's about $6 (I think).   For the most part that puts their sushi on par with food fair or superstore pricing and it's fresher in most cases.  

If I'm feeling fancy sushi I'd probably go to somewhere like Kinjo but if I'm just feeling something simple then we'd head here.   I would recommend - but only if you're not planning to go right before me and make me wait a bit longer! ;)

Review 4 of 30 in Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"The menu is on the wall and the food is prepared at the counter you order at.  All the seating is upstairs.

The staff was decently friendly and the place is clean, but mostly stark.  The sushi is just okay and the wasabi tastes of cheap horseradish.

On the whole: a worthy inexpensive place to get some sushi."}
{"text":"This is quite comparable to Szechuan Express across the street--fast, cheap, and no frills, perfect for students on the go. Like Sushi Fuku next door, this is actually run by Chinese/Taiwanese owners, so they have a bunch of the usual fast Chinese stuff like lo mein and various things with rice. Taste is actually not too bad and portions are huge for what you pay. They even have the Taiwanese braised pork stew and egg with rice (???), which comes with a lot of ground pork and vegetables. While it could have been made less salty and with less sauce, it's not much to complain about. There's not much ambiance here, though there's seating upstairs apparently if you wish to eat in."}
{"text":"I love coming here!! Such a fun experience.  The food is always tasty  and fresh. Staff are friendly and nice and i feel the prices are very fair. I think everyone should eat her at least once."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: If you are looking for great sushi joint, this is not it.  I only come here for two reasons:

1) I am sort of craving sushi and need a cheap, quick lunch.  I can get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for about $8.  Not bad.

2) I am meeting a friend for lunch on campus.  They have a dining room upstairs with plenty of tables and it is usually pretty quiet; perfect for conversation."}
{"text":"This is my usual restaurant for a quick sushi fix.  The key is to not go during the busy time with a big group which results in a long wait. I try to get there right at 5pm (the boats are filled with freshly made sushi and cooked foods) else later in the evening after 8 (place order directly with server as boats are semi-empty and some dishes may have sailed around the belt for some time).  

Sushi is fresh and portions are a fair size. Also there is cooked food along with good selection for vegetarians. They also have gluten free soy sauce for those with wheat/gluten sensitivity.

What's amazing about this place is that the price has been quite consistent and hasn't changed much in the last few years. Most other places have adjusted prices to factor in inflation and higher operating costs."}
{"text":"Nice food, reasonable price, I love their steak stew rice bowl. Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This starts off somewhat negative, but please read on...

I have never eaten sushi at Sushi Boat.  Nor would I.  Leaving aside  the fact that I'm now a vegetarian, were I to desire the relatively risky consumption of uncooked sea creatures, I would want to partake in an ultra-clean, temperature-controlled restaurant devoted to serving raw fish to patrons.  And I don't mind paying a lot for it, either, so long as they can deliver on taste and safety.

Sushi Boat is a cramped, not exactly pristine place that always seems too hot and is designed to quickly produce food for hungry, anxious undergrads.  So I might avoid their raw fish, but I am all about their other food.

What's to love?

-The menu is great.  You pick a starch (rice, noodles), a protein (tofu, various meats and seafoods), a style (soup, rice bowl, noodle bowl), and a flavor (Szechuan, Hunan, Thai, etc.).  Very simple, designed for speed, and well thought out.
-Great for vegetarians, and they'll work with you on things like steaming vs. frying the tofu.
-Cheap soups and appetizers.
-The quantity is right on.
-There's seating upstairs for dining in.
-A nice selection of canned/bottled drinks.
-The register guy is very professional and friendly, which I can't say about some other restaurants in Oakland.

What's not to love?

-The seating area is kinda dirty and unattended.  They can do better for probably very low cost.
-They don't use sustainable to-go containers.  That's a problem all over PGH.

If you're looking for a fast, relatively healthy lunch, this is a great place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi boat for years and years and years (and then some). Having lived in this part of the city for over 10 years Sushi Boat has always been a staple of our family's dining choices. And until Kinjo moved in Sushi Boat was THE KING of Sushi in the NW.

Did it live up to it's title? Most of the time. The Sushi is a nice mix of traditional Sashimi based Sushi as well as the infamous California Roll and its variants. Over the years I've seen the price rise dramatically and that's been a little disheartening as the quality remained the same. If I am hungry I am not rushing out the door to go to Sushi Boat (especially since I've been so many times). But if I am having a craving for Sushi I don't mind dropping by.

When the sushi is fresh the food is quite good and the service here is always quite good. Small space, can be a long wait on busy nights.

I expect Sushi boat will be around for a very very long time still."}
{"text":"If you don't go here
You'll miss the best Philly rolls
And crab rangoon, EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got an order of 8 pieces of alaska rolls and 10 fried dumplings and it only cost $8.50!! I was so amazed. It was so good that I want to go back and get it again tomorrow because it was super cheap. I kind of had to wait a while for my food, but it was really worth it."}
{"text":"Simply put: the sushi here was not good.  The preparation was OK, but the ingredients used just weren't adequate to the task.  The fish wasn't of particularly high quality, and they didn't even get basic rolls right.  The spicy tuna roll, a common and popular item which I frequently use as a benchmark for places, tasted like the tuna had been sitting out a bit too long and the spicy sauce was basically mayo.  I did my best to scrape it off.  I tried three separate rolls here, all of which disappointed.  I wound up going to Five Guys afterwards for a burger just to get the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Run of the mill Chinese place. My girl would give this place 5 stars due to the buffalo chicken roll. I've tried it, really no big deal! Atmosphere and cs are horrible, they don't really understand English, which I hate! I could accept it if they knew how to cook, but its the same as any Chinese take out! Don't expect anything anything
Special, like speaking English! If English was spoken, id give 3 stars at most."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good sushi here in Pittsburgh :I 
I got a combo of california rolls, yellowtail rolls, and spicy tuna rolls. I was so happy at first to see tempura yam rolls--I had them in Canada and fell in love.

Unfortunately, none of them were good. The california rolls were made of very low quality imitation crab. The spicy tuna rolls did not taste good, and the yellowtail tasted fishy (pun intended LOL). The tempura yam rolls made me nostalgic, but they honestly tasted pretty bad as well.

Sadly, this was all in all a very disappointing experience and I shan't be back."}
{"text":"I'm quite confused at the high reviews for this place. I'm quite aware that I should not expect much from a fast-food sushi joint but there was something off about the sushi -- it just tasted funny and I couldn't tell if it was a rotten taste or not. The spicy salmon is NOT normal spicy salmon that is ground up and yummy--it's actually salmon pieces made slightly spicy somehow. Bf also ordered some super greasy noodle dish which had such a fishy egg (xin1) taste that neither of us could eat it without dousing it in sriracha sauce. And normally, I love egg.

The upstair seating area was something you might expect in rural china, with self serve hot water that you can using styrofoam (ew) cups.
This is NOT a 4 star restaurant, and we will probably not come again.

That said, I haven't tried their other menu options, and the staff was pretty nice at least. We left a good tip."}
{"text":"Sushi Boat will always be my favorite. I've been going here since high school and the only thing that's changed is that the waiting area has expanded. It's ALWAYS busy here, so if you go for dinner, either line up for the 5PM open or go late. I rarely get a table right away but the good news is that it's generally pretty quick, it's an in & out type of place and people don't usually linger. My boyfriend and I go here about twice a month and still see the same servers from years ago. They are so friendly and always walking around to refill drinks, take orders, or bring your bill but they aren't in your face and annoying. We always order from the menu, rather than the boats (unless we are STARVED) and my favorite items are definitely:

-Salmon Sushi Pizza (GET IT)
-Special Eel Roll
-Dynamite Roll
-Tempura Salmon Roll 
-Udon Soup
-Tempura Yam
-Green Tea Ice Cream (mmm...)

They also have the sweet soya sauce which is my FAVE. We order a lot, and our bill is never over $50, which I think is pretty fair for the quality of sushi. Plus, it's right by my house so very convenient, we do takeout sometimes too which is pretty quick. I just wish they didn't close for the dinner rush from 2-5, because I believe they would get a lot of business if they stayed open. But for a quick sushi fix, Sushi Boat is definitely my top spot!"}
{"text":"After my trip to Japan last year I became some what of a sushi snob. I wouldn't go near any places that weren't \"authentic\". I've now gotten past that as I realize I'm in the cold of yyc. 

Sushi boat was the start of my reawakening with sushi in yyc. I was nostalgic for the conveyor belt sushi I had become so accustomed to while in japan, the same quick convenience of such can be found right here at this resturant. 

This resturant doesn't take reservations, so make sure you either get here early or are ready to wait for your turn. 

Each item is placed on a different coloured plate indicating the price of said item. Therefore for those that have small appetites or are budget conscience it is the perfect destination. 

Personally, I rarely grab items off the sushi boats unless something really catches my eye. I typically will ask for an order sheet so that I can take my time choosing items both from the cold and hot selections. I love being able to watch the sushi chefs prepare our food as well.

I can truly say I love almost all their dishes here. Prices are great for their quality. I always keep an eye out for any new menu items and get super excited whenever uni is available. 

Both dine in and takeout are great options here. If you're looking for an authentic sushi experience that is not pricey sushi boat is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to get cheap sushi in the area. The first time I came here I wasn't that into it, but upon a second helping and different menu choices, I actually really like it though. It's cheaper than the campus-packaged sushi at CMU and honestly it tastes better. Each roll of about 6 pieces of sushi is about $4-5 so you could get about 12 pieces for under $10. I usually get the Unagi Special Roll (about $5, only fifty cents or so more expensive than a regular Unagi roll which just comes without avocado) and a Crunchy Spicy Roll (I've had it with salmon, tuna, and red snapper - all good). 

The staff downstairs are all business; they just want to get your order in and out. The guy who hangs around upstairs asking for advice on how to pronounce things (who I heard may be the owner?) is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Came here when it opened at 5pm and there was already a line up and we still had to wait! But the wait wasn't long cuz ppl generally just eat and go and don't dilly dally! I agree with many reviewers, if you're looking for excellent exotic sushi, look elsewhere.  No omakase here, it's a rotating sushi bar or in this case... A \"floatating\"sushi bar - stick to the basics ;-).  The overall experience was fun - watching boats filled with sushi floating around an island and taking whatever dish you want!  =)"}
{"text":"Won't be going back! The sushi was uneven and poorly made, poor selection and items that were left out the whole visit. Worst sushi I have had. Was much better years ago but has certainly gone downhill. Good concept, poor execution."}
{"text":"Sushi Boat is on par with the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner of Oakland Ave and Forbes. The only difference is that the name indicates the slightly larger Sushi and Japanese menu. The menu is laid out in a fashion such that patrons would feel more comfortable ordering certain Japanese entrees here that they would not feel as comfortable ordering at the other American style Chinese restaurants on the corner."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.

Sushi boat is not like any other Japanese restaurant. The draw for us to try this place out was due to the fact that you can eat sushi a la carte via boats on water (like a conveyor belt.)

Bottomline: cool experience picking sushi from a moving boat, but I would recommend ordering from the server instead.

Atmosphere: it was really nice to know that conveyor belt type sushi restaurants were still available in Calgary. The experience of picking your own sushi from a boat on water is a cool one. Restaurant is small so make sure to make a reso if you want to sit next to the boats.

Food: as expected, the sushi isn't all that fresh due to the way it is served. However, there is a solution. By ordering through your server, the sushi is always made fresh and it sure tastes great. The rice is cooked well and fish to rice ratio is on point. Our favorite kind of sushi is the saba (mackerel) and they sure deliver here. Cooked food, on the other hand, was subpar.

Value: considering how expensive quality sushi is in Calgary, Sushi Boat is a fairly cheap place to have good sushi. It's a perfect inexpensive place to have a la carte sushi if you are around the area."}
{"text":"Always love Sushi Go Round and I guess Sushi Boat is the best in Calgary.

Time Wait:
I usually avoid going there from 6pm to 7pm coz the long line up. So I prefer to be there before 5:30pm or after 7:30pm. 
I was there around 7:45pm last Thursday (Oct 09) with my husband, we did not need to wait at all. But if you pick table or booth, then it might take 15 to 30 min. 

Service:
The service was okay. I was surprised that they actually missed our order as it was not busy. And when I went to the cashier and paid for the bill, there's no conversation at all, she said zero word to me...

Food:
As the sushi rice was made by machines, so they always falling apart. But the taste and the freshness of the rice and seafood are not bad. I used to love the sushi pizza but it seems like not as good as before. And there's not much choices to pick from the boats, always need to order what we want."}
{"text":"Meh. The sushi here is nothing to be excited about. It's not fresh, bland, and the selection is rather limited. People rave about the price, too, but actually it's not really that inexpensive. If you want good sushi, go to Wholey's in the Strip District, not here."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went to another place last night and it stirred a craving, soooooo I figured I'd try someplace else.  I surfed yelp for something close by and ended up here.

First impression...these folks don't want my business!!!  The lady at the counter was beyond rude!  Handing her a $50, she checked enough times to make the US Mint second guess it's authenticity!

Okay, so on to the food.  Last night I had red snapper for the first time, it was amazing, so I wondered to my self...self, is it the fish or preparation?  Answer...it was the prep!  The red snapper here was beyond horrible!  Ok, on to the smoked salmon...well on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being excellent, this scored a solid 3.  I moved on to the spider roll...again 1-10, a concrete -2!!!  Last but not least was the Unagi (eel for the uninitiated), well let's just say this one ended up in the napkin!  

Overall, I'd say that the execution failed miserably!  (I'm trying to be polite)  The rice was certainly not sushi quality and seemed more like over-cooked uncle ben's instant rice.  The presentation of the styrofoam plates was...well less than green (and I'm not tree hugger) and the all important taste...let's just leave it at I've pissed away $25 doing dumber things in life! 

If it were possible to give this place less than 1 star, I would.  Actually, I'm inclined to say more like -3!

At least the canned green tea was ok."}
{"text":"This is the definition of hole in the wall food. You could blink and miss Sushi Boat, but I would not suggest it. Their food is fantastic. Words can not describe it. Their portion size is HUGE compared to their prices. The california roll is 5.75$ for SIXTEEN pieces of sushi. Yeah, it is fake crab, does that really matter for 5.75$? I go here often for lunch, keep their menu by my desk, and recomend it to all of my co-workers. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got 16 pieces of sushi for just $9. Where else can you get that kind of a deal?! Don't worry about the fish not being fresh or the rice being too thick of a layer because the fish is fresh and the layer of rice is a normal thickness. 

Sushi Fuku next door has always been the more welcoming restaurant in terms of appearance, but now that I've tried Sushi Boat, I think I will probably be going to the latter way more. The sushi tastes better and is a better value. 

The owners are super sweet too! 

Taste | 4
Atmosphere | 3

{"text":"Don't let the name fool you - while I'm sure their sushi is good, their Chinese food has always been A+ and definitely the best General Tso's in Pittsburgh! SUPER cheap for the amounts you get and all around my favorite place to eat at in Oakland. They are always fast as well which is perfect when I'm ordering for pickup and have to get back to work in 5 minutes! The owners are wonderful and service is perfect!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I tried their rainbow roll few months ago. The fish is pretty much tasteless."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall type place. One of my favorite cheap, quick and good lunch places in Oakland. Good prices for poor students on a budget. Decent variety of sushi and entree options. Small area, so seating is sometimes a problem, but I usually get my sushi to go."}
{"text":"OK food. Not a good place for sushi."}
{"text":"The beef noodle stew was nothing like the picture.  Wrong type of overcooked noodles and the egg was cold. The picture showed tea egg, but what i got was just normal egg. so disappointed. I'd rather pay more to have good food."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week for sushi and usually get an Alaska and shrimp tempura roll. The price is great for how much food you get, and their rolls are always freshly made to order. The owners are very friendly as well. It may not look all that great on the inside or outside...but who really cares when you can get two rolls of sushi for less than 9 bucks?"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that bases their business around sushi, they sure are clueless on how to make a decent roll. The sweet potato tempura roll was super greasy yet bland, and the ginger must've been sitting out for a good bit because it was dry and shriveled. The only good thing about this meal was that it was sort of edible and I paid $3.50 for it."}
{"text":"You know that you are in a true Japanese Restaurant when you can hear the chefs within the sushi bar and staff are talking in Japanese."}
{"text":"This is a bargain sushi place--so, don't go expecting mind-blowing sushi. It's cheap. If you go in figuring to get reasonable tasting sushi for a pretty good price, then you'll probably have a satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty.
Nothing special quality wise.
Just decent sushi.
No fancy rolls like some other places.

Have to say my favourite is the Salmon Sushi Pizza.
Get it! AWEsome!
Rainbow roll is always a go-to item as well.

Usually pretty busy.
Wait can be 2 mins to 30 mins depending on time of day.
Stick around, the wait list will evaporate quickly.
People pretty much eat and go.

So if you are looking for a good, quick, sushi fix.
The Sushi Boat will satisfy.

If you want to introduce your kids to sushi, this is the place to go.
They will love the boat going around with sushi on it. Fun for them :-)
Get them some tempura shrimp or yams.
Next thing you know, they will be having the spicy tuna roll or unagi."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this is not the best sushi. This place is just about presentation and atmosphere. If you come here at lunch time during the week it is hard to get a seat at the table, the prepared Sushi plates that come around on boats is a nice touch, I used to be a regular here years ago and have moved too far away however it's a nice touch of nostalgia whenever I come by."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few things from this place. The sushi is hands down very good. Not the best prices in town. but good. I've had udon stir fry noodles and fried rice. The udon was edible, not the most flavor. The worse was the chicken fried rice. They us fried chicken pieces like nuggets and no vegetables, no sauce, not even a pinch of salt. I wanted to give them 3.5 star. There is no 1/2 option. Go for the sushi, possibly the udon noodles. Stay away from the fried rice. The upstairs dining is rather pleasant. Small space, but plenty of condiments and complimentary cold water."}
{"text":"Sushi was just ok. Not a big selection and what was available all tasted the same. The reason for the two-star review was that nearly every boat was empty! The restaurant was not that full, but the boats stayed empty. Disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent sushi place around the Pitt campus, this place is pretty good. They make really good sushi here and also make other Japanese dishes too. Their chickn teriyaki dish it pretty good. Only drawback is that this place is pretty expensive. Otherwise, place is a great place to grab lunch or a quick bite."}
