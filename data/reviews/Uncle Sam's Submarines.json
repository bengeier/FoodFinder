{"text":"I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.

The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.

Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.

Negatives:
- The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an \"old\" look, it could really use a facelift.

- They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.

- Wish they were open late!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here once because we had heard so much about it.  We both ordered the ultimate cheesesteak. The prices are very reasonable. For two cheesesteaks, a ton of fries and one medium drink, it was under $20 for the two of us.

The cheesesteaks were delicious, very tasty. What bothered me was the bread. It seemed liked any generic bread you could buy at the grocery store. This is not a chain restaurant and it is known throughout this area, one would think they would have better quality bread and fill them up since the food didn't fill up the roll they gave me.

Also, the fries, you could tell they just came from a freezer bag. They weren't terrible but they weren't amazing either. 

All in all, the price is right and food was tasty but it's not the best hoagie I've ever had, nor do I think it's anything super special. We might go back and try a cold sandwich instead of a hot one."}
{"text":"Best cheese steak I have ever eaten.  Had the ultra with mushrooms and peppers.  Bread is good, and the steak is not overly greasy or salty.  Fries were crisp and cooked nicely also.  Tables were clean.  They brought out the subs to us."}
{"text":"First time I ate at an Uncle Sam's I believe it was this one. The sub sandwiches are stacked and have always tasted fresh. If you order a sub you get fries with it and I often think the real reason I go is to get an order of these fries...shoestring style and salty deliciousness!

There is seating in the back with mirrors on the walls and at lunch time it can be very busy. Sometimes it feels sketchy but the food is too good to even matter. I think there's an upstairs too but that has always been closed when I've been there.

5 Stars for Uncle's!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are average size, service is horrible unless you are a friend of the owner or staff, oh yeah the owner is a real ***hole. Plus they don't take credit cards?, really, this is the 21st century Sam. don't bother wasting your time trying to park in Oakland. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Not much more to say, simply great subs. My favorite is the steak sub, but there are certainly other good choices here. Fries that come with are pretty good too. Reasonably priced but cash only."}
{"text":"Loved this place while I was at school in Pittsburgh. Definitely would pick the Oakland location over the Squirrel Hill. Maybe it was just me but the texture and quality of the submarine bread is better in Oakland. I'm not sure what kind of sauce/spice/whatever they put on their sandwiches but they certainly add extra flavor and tastiness to the mix. Love their french fries too--they are the perfect crispiness and come in huge helpings. The sandwiches alone are giant. Eating here kept me full for the day or the leftovers lasted for two meals."}
{"text":"YUM! I recently started to go to uncle Sams a lot more than usual because their food never fails to taste amazing end it is hands-down the best sub in town. I always get the steak and egg sandwich which comes with free fries for eat in meals! There is never too long of a line and they do their best to keep it as clean as possible."}
{"text":"The food is good, however the service is awful. Very rude staff. The blonde girl that always has her hair pulled up is not friendly at all.  I heard her talking about customers very badly. Also the guy working the grill was not wearing gloves while he was making the food. He was touching the food with his bare hands... All of the staff here wear shirts that say something about being friendly but that is cleary a joke since everyone here is rude.  It always bothers me when people that have jobs in a customer service based enviroment are rude."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight.  They won't give a total over the phone.  Doesn't make sense for a place that only accepts cash.  Got home to find that the cheese that comes that comes standard with my sandwich was missing but the onions I asked to be left off weren't.  My husband's order wasn't right either.  The bread was the only thing that was good.  Guess that's what you get from a place with four young teenagers behind the counter all eating."}
{"text":"While the sandwiches are delicious, my last experience going to Uncle Sam's was terrible due to the nasty server I encountered. I went there to get a Philly Steak for my grandfather who is in the hospital on Saturday afternoon. He has a gluten allergy and cannot eat bread at all, so I asked for a six-inch sandwich without the bread. The girl looked at me like I was an idiot and said \"What's a six-inch sandwich?\" I answered, \"A half of a sandwich.\", which she replied that they only do whole sandwiches. Fair enough, but there was no need to get snippy. I then asked her if she can give it to me without the bread. She told me she was unable to do that. When I asked why, she said that they have no containers whatsoever. I find that hard to believe. If that is the case, she could have offered to put it in a cup or wrap it some other way. Instead, she just looked at me like I was asking for the moon on a silver platter. I work in Oakland go there very often for lunch. After this experience I doubt I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loaded Italian sausage sub... No need to say more! (Get cheese sauce for your fries). I have never had a bad sub from this place and doubt I ever will!"}
{"text":"Long time favorite place of mine.  I stick with the Cheese Steak and can never finish a full one.  If you order in, you get fries included.

They usually have some cheaper specials for kids."}
{"text":"Sams in Squirrel Hill has pretty awesome cheesesteak and great employees/service. Can't beat the sweet potato fries either."}
{"text":"BEST FRIES EVER. (if you like them thin and crispy which, to me, is perfection in a fry)

I've been going to this place since I was a teenager, so I may be a bit biased, but if you like a good deal in a great sandwich, then it's definitely the place to go. I always order the steak sub, everything but cheese, with extra fries. The bread is ALWAYS fresh. They are generous with the meat and toppings, and very fast. 

The atmosphere is nothing special, but it's clean and if you can snag a spot by the window to people-watch, you won't be disappointed. 

Note: I took my brother, who lives in Philly, here not long ago and he was not happy with the cheese steak. Especially with the fact that they didn't have any cheese wiz. But if you want a Philly-style cheese steak, with that weird fake cheese from a can, then by all means, go to Philly and knock yourself out. Uncle Sam's is not a Philly cheese steak place, it's a Pittsburgh sub shop, so be warned."}
{"text":"i have had sams subs for as long as i remember. consistent in quality. filling. best fries in the world. subs are phenomenal. can't get enough of it. the grilled portabela subs are FANTASTIC!!! THE steak subs are just amaaazing! can't believe it's not  a chain. it is reasonable in price. only problem is the space. its tiny and dark. not the best dine in. staff is fast. if ur in Pittsburgh you HAVE TO give it a try."}
{"text":"The service is fast and the food is great I don't see why you wouldn't want to eat here"}
{"text":"The food is good, although the chicken in the chicken cheese steaks is dry, and the menu advertises some things they haven't had in years (like fontina for the vegetarian subs).  I never manage to get anything other than the Special Italian (with everything, naturally).  Fries are always hot but don't taste like much.  Service varies from nonchalant to downright surly, and I always feel a little sick after I eat here, just from all the grease.  Not worth a special trip, but it's a huge meal for not too much money and it tastes good."}
{"text":"Free chips when dine in!! They yaste so nice!!
The cheesesteak is OK, as well as people there. The price is reasonable and I cannot finish one myself since so many staff there."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and good sandwiches. This is a neighborhood staple that deserves your business."}
{"text":"Solid cheesesteaks in Pittsburgh. And if you eat inside, you get fries with your cheesesteak :)"}
{"text":"Every sandwich I've ever had there was delicious. The people are nice and the service is fast.  Cheap too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.  I usually got the Uncle Sam's Special.  Their fries are pretty good.  I can't describe why, they just seem like regular fries.  But they're always crisp (not mushy) and salted just the right touch."}
{"text":"This place used to  make good sandwiches and rhe staff were friendly. Quality of food preparation has substantially declined and staff are rude. They barely look at you and never thank you. Floors and tables are filthy and during my most recent and forever final visit, a mouse was casually eating dropped food from previous customers right by my foot and the staff did not even react when I told them."}
{"text":"This place got really good subs. Freshly made and not a long waiting time. We had the Special Italian sub and the Ultra Uncle Sams Special. The Price is totally fine and the subs taste great.. you get them with fries. 
I don't give 5 stars because you can only pay cash and we didn't see a sign or anything where it says it. So of course got there with not enough cash... we had to take a trip to the Atm.  We aren't from around here that's why we went and got cash."}
{"text":"I got the Ultra Philly Cheesesteak and fries... talk about some fresh ingredients! . Meat tender just right and did not need nothing more or less than what it comes with (mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and fried onions). It was my first time in Pittsburgh and it surely won't be my last! I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"By far the best sub and the best eatery in the pittsburgh metro. The hot italian is amazing. Soft bread, high quality meat, fresh tomatoe. This is the best food in western PA. Only downside is they are cash only to avoid credit card fees and avoid corporate income tax."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good little sub shop. I split the cheese steak and buffalo chicken subs half and half with my girlfriend and both were pretty tasty. Their fries are quality as well and the prices are just right. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best subs in the 'burgh. I know everyone says primantis, but if youre looking for taste and not hype, this is the spot. Checkout the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I like Uncle Sam's. I went to college in the area and now work in Oakland so I have been a frequent customer over the past decade or so. 

Let's start with the extras. Their fries are amazing but so oily I often feel like I'm hardening an artery as I eat them but they are so good I reckon it's OK to have them once in a while (as long as you split an order). They also have a fried onion thing that is kind of like an onion ring, only not ring shaped, they are also very good. 

Beer selection:  I am unsure if the Oakland Uncle Sam's has beer. I live in the Robinson area so we usually go to the Robinson US for dinner (aka beer time). Their beer selection is pretty good considering it's a sandwich shop not a bar. We usually split a six pack for our group of 4 and the price is reasonable as well. 

Subs: I usually get the cheese steak with onions and pepper. I think it's pretty good. They cook them right there in front of you so at least it is freshly made. I have found that if you go here during lunch or dinner more often than not they burn your steak. This is a recent development and only happens at the Oakland location.  This is the only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4. I like a hot dog charred but not a cheese steak. The bread here is really good. I think it is Mancini's but I've never asked. I was a vegetarian for many many years but have never tried one of US veggie subs. They cook their veggies and their meat on the same surface so if you are a strict vegetarian who doesn't want your veggies contaminated by cooking on the same surface as meat this is not the  place for you. I just don't understand this because they have a ton of vegetarian options that all sound great but then they cook them on a meat cooked surface. So beware if you want a truly vegetarian meal! 

Parking: Parking is mostly street parking. There is a parking garage not far from here but the price to park in the garage is a bit steep and during work hours it can be hard to find a spot in the garage to begin with! Your best bet is street parking but if you can't parallel park you're pretty much out of luck. 

There isn't much space to die in so you're better off getting your meal to go and walking over the Schenley Plaza and getting a table and having your lunch out of doors. I say it's worth a trip but not a trip out of your way!"}
{"text":"This place does not accept credit cards in the year 2015. Service is incredibly slow and it was nearly a 45 minute wait to get my takeout order of a single sub. Also you don't get fries or sides included with your sub when you get take out. It is not mentioned anywhere as a policy but they will absolutely charge you the same amount of money and give you less food. Overall just a really bad experience. So bad that I would suggest Panera instead as a pre-movie food option."}
{"text":"I can eat a submarine just about any day of the week and it's probably a good thing that I don't live close by to \"Uncle Sam's,\" because I would.  I have only been here a few times, but have never been disappointed.  I have tried an array of sub shops in my time and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  The menu boasts a wide variety of subs and toppings including a Vegetarian menu, if you are in to that, but what separates it from most places is their emphasis on the Cheese Steak and their generous portions of meat.  Most shops around here tend to be a little lean on the meat and they more than compensate you for your dollar.  A regular does me just fine, but for those of a more carnivorous nature, they also have their Ultra menu which gives you double the meat if not more.  Another thing that i find refreshing is their Shoestring french fries, that they provide you with as a side if you dine in extra if you take out.  They also offer a Chicken Cheese Steak, which is also difficult to find in most shops.  Drink wise, they offer a variety of craft soda, craft beer, and of course your fountain.  Refills are extra. 

Onto the Service.  In all honesty it can be a little hit or miss.  I have gone and have had great service where my food is ready and brought out immediately and there have been times where I have sat and waited a bit too long.  Having worked in food service I understand that it isn't perfect every time, but generally the wait is worth with it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant is Cash Only.

If anyone is looking for a sub shop with character and delicious hoagies I would highly recommend it.  If subs aren't your thing the \"Burgatory\" and \"Panera Bread\" are next door."}
{"text":"Best subs I have EVER had. 
Uncle Sam's special is bomb diggity. Bread = awesome. Meat = awesome. Overall just a huge great experience eating here. And I don't think you can get bored of this place with their wide menu. Just excellent. Love coming here with schoolmates."}
{"text":"Definitely a little biased, as I basically lived on these subs for 4 years while on campus.  Still my favorite.  Italian Special, hot, everything except onions is my standard.  In fact, I don't think I have ever deviated.  Miss the original owner who greeted everyone as \"son\" upon leaving.  Never miss a chance to go back while in town."}
{"text":"To each their own, but I'm surprised there's one negative review about Uncle Sams. 

I've been coming here on and off since 2003 when I started going to Pitt.  Someone had told me about the place before I arrived on campus and after the first time I went here, I went here every day for 30 days straight.  That's right.  I ate here every day for 1 month and it never got old.  I've never had anything expect the mushroom cheese steak and it's simply the best.  They season it well and it's always delicious.  

My ex from Philly took me to have a famous Philadelphia cheese steak when I was there and it couldn't compare to Uncle Sam's!  Like someone else said, who the heck puts cheeze whiz spread on a sandwich?  That's Philly for ya lol.

A couple of things that could be improved is like someone else said they used canned mushrooms which aren't bad, but aren't great.  The place could use a renovation and they could always have more friendly people taking your order. 

Just last weekend I was at the Uncle Sams in Robinson and the girl who took my order there was one of the best and kindest servers to ever wait on me.  Need more servers like her!"}
{"text":"50c on soda refills and free fries with your sub but only if you eat in. Uncle Sam's is about nickles and dimes and the food's quality doesn't justify.

Every sandwich has a healthy dose of lettuce, tomato, an onion, but the spongy bread is too sweet. Sometimes the Italian tastes overcooked or old, like bad prosciutto. The steak is gray and bland. My go-to is the portabella, still my favorite after years. 

Ketchup on the trash can door and rickety dining room tables and chairs. The back half is depressing and the window-ed front half cramped. Atmosphere at Sam's is as thin as the service.

Come for lunch and an afternoon of shopping on forbes avenue maybe followed by a film at the manor, but it's tough to justify with great pizza at Aiellos just a few blocks down Murray."}
{"text":"You ever work back of the house at a suburban chain restaurant? Picture that disgusting dish rack. The greasy ass floors. You crawl out like a slug at the end of your slimy shift.

That's this place.

It might be the setup--kitchen at the front and clogged lunch line blocking the door. It could be the low ceilings and wobbly cafeteria tables. It's possibly the abundance of grimy college kids taking a study break. No offense college kids, but your grimier activities elsewhere leave you thinking this is a safe haven. It's not.

The sandwiches are not good enough to justify how dirty you feel when you leave. So order to go? They take away your fries.

Bottom line: avoid this place. Spend an extra 20 minutes and catch the 61C towards the cleaner location in squirrel hill."}
{"text":"Great place for a vegetarian sub. The portabella mushroom sub is fantastic. Fast service."}
{"text":"First time in today. Asked about the \"Italian Tuna Sub\" on the \"From the Grill\" menu. Was told it's not grilled or toasted but is a tuna base with no mayo. OK... Are the other toppings for the \"From the Grill\" menu items included? Yes. OK... One order of a tuna with cheese to go. $10 + $1 tip and as I watch the guy make my sandwich (fully unobstructed view of the prep area from the pick-up counter), I see that this sandwich is actually bread, handfuls of shredded lettuce, and raw tuna emptied directly from the cans. Bread, raw tuna, lettuce. All while continually wiping the counter with a filthy rag and returning to handling my order repeatedly after using this rag.

Rather than go through the hassle of canceling my order and asking for a refund from the surly teenager working the register (never mind that I pre-tipped on this service!), I took my order (filthy rag handled bread, raw tuna, and lettuce) and promptly disposed of it outside. Will never, ever return to this chain.

It's not Italian, or grilled, or even hygienic, and it's certainly not good!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I crave.  I went to college near by and would use Uncle Sams as a place to treat myself to some good grub and great leftovers.  I love the Portabella Mushroom sandwich.  Not sure how they perfected the marinade on the mushrooms, but it is perfect.  The buns are light and fluffy, and that is a good thing.  The fries are of the best out there.  

The atmosphere is a dive, but the fact that you can watch someone cook your food, is a big bonus.  It looks the exact same as it did 10-15 years ago and I like that.  Clean?  Maybe not, but still rather sit in their establishment than in a McDonalds.  

I request to go here on special occasions because the subs are just right and fit that need of something greasy yet especially delicious.  A sub shop that should be one of the WQED Pittsburgh Restaurant shows, for sure.  Has hometown Pittsburgh written all over it.  One of my all time favorites. 

If you don't finish all your sub, take it up to the counter where you ordered and they will wrap it up to take home.  The Portabella sandwich is even great cold out of a dorm fridge!"}
{"text":"While the food here is good, there are a number of reasons why I can't recommend it to my friends.

The inside is cramped and aged and while I have no problems with hole in the wall style restaurants, this is not an excuse to have an unclean interior which looks like it hasn't been cared for in many years.  In addition to this the owners of this franchise look to nickel and dime you in every conceivable way including charging for tap water, charging for soda refills, and charging you $3 if you want to use a debit card.  Not only this, but if you want to get your sandwich to go they'll charge you extra for fries, which are normally included as a side if you eat in.  A typical sandwich will run you about $8 with no drink.

One time while I stood in line waiting for a sandwich, the man who appeared to be the owner started complaining to his employees that whoever cut the portobello mushrooms that day had made them too thick, which was \"costing him money.\"

Nothing puts a bad taste in your mouth like getting ripped off."}
{"text":"Yummy subs. I crave it even when I'm not in the city of Pittsburgh. It's pretty satisfying, even though it clearly is unhealthy to eat too many times in one week. The fries are only free if you eat there - you have to order it for take out. The bacon cheeseburger is my favorite sub, but the special is pretty good as well. I hear the salads are decent, too. Cash only. Parking is best over at the lot across the street, under the library."}
{"text":"One of the two ladies working there, the one that brought out my sub was rude, I asked her for hot sauce and she pointed me to the condiments counter saying rudly \"over there\" so I proceeded over there, and found no hot sauce, went up to the counter and had to ask a cook for a bottle of hot sauce while she was standing next to him ignoring me with an immature grin! think I'll just continue using grub hub to avoid such nasty staff members."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here today for lunch.  We didn't know it was a \"cash\" only establishment but the guy who waited on us was very nice.  He took our order and by the time we got back from Giant Eagle with cash, our subs were done.  They were very good and the price was great for the amount of food.  I had the Italian sub and my girlfriend had the Philly cheese steak.  I loved the sub rolls and the fries were delicious.  I would definitely come back and try a new sub!"}
{"text":"The subs here are tasty, of dubious health (who cares? it's delicious =) ), and cheap! 

The bad:
1. They close real early
2. There are weird rules like being charged for refills (is syrup that expensive?) and no credit cards accepted.

Anyhow, it's probably one of the best places to get a cheesesteak in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks in Pittsburgh by far!  They use fresh steak that they chip for each sub, and fresh provolone with delicious Mancini's bread!  No need to order separate french fries because they include them with your sandwich if you eat there.  Dare I say better than in Philly?  Well I can say no cheese whiz."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Uncle Sam's for over 10 years between all of their Pittsburgh locations, almost exclusively eating in for lunch. Their subs are good, their fries are good, the wait can be a little long.

I don't mind them being cash only. I don't mind the unpleasant cashiers.

I mind not getting French fries with my to go order and not having a reason behind it other than its your \"policy.\" Especially when it costs the same price. If it's because of soggy fries, here's your solution, leave the top of the bag open.

If I pay the same amount you could at least tell me why I can't have the fries. And when I ask (in a sarcastic manner) that if I would've said \"for here\" taken one bite and asked you to wrap it up I wasn't asking for an honest answer I was pointing out how dumb this policy is."}
{"text":"Maybe more of a college food shop. Cheesesteak was average.  Probably should have got the fries folks were raving about.  Should have gotten fountain soda as bottles were warm. Maybe next time i'll get the italian sub as it looked good."}
{"text":"Omigosh - the best ever steak sub! I got it with peppers, onions and mushrooms. My only critique would be the canned mushrooms. Ugh. Fresh would have been so much better, and they seem to offer a good selection of vegetarian fare so why the canned crap? Nevertheless, it was a terrific sandwich at a sort of fair price. I did appreciate them cutting it into 4 pieces since I was headed to the turnpike and needed manageable food. I had half left over and it re-heated next day just fine. The guy even said \"have a safe trip\" .... how nice is that?!?!? I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this place out while visiting family in PA. Everyone kept talking about how good the sandwiches were. I had to try it! I got the Mediterranean sub which had cheese, cucumbers, lettuce, black olives, tomatoes and several other veggies. It comes with a huge portion of fries too and they are yummy! I could not finish half of my food because it was so much, but it was fantastic! Now I know why people love this place! They remember you by what you are wearing too. Stop by and grab a sandwich if you are near one of the locations! They had a few veggie options and serve salads too."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's has some of the best subs I've ever had.  

Almost all of their subs are great, including their Italian, Ham and Cheese, Turkey, etc.  My favorites are the Steak and Egg and the Capicola

The prices aren't bad either, as a sandwich, a large handful of fires and a drink will run you about $7-$8.  

My only complaint with Uncle Sam's is its hours, as they close around 8 or 9 every night."}
{"text":"Did a quick take-out on a recent trip to Pittsburgh.  This area is chock-full of places to eat, but I'd had my eye on this place due to their reputation for good sandwiches.

The \"special\" Phlly cheesesteak I ordered came with grilled sweet peppers, mushrooms and melted provolone cheese.  I think next time I'd leave off the lettuce and tomato...guess I'm more of a \"purist\". ;-)  The huge bag of fries were also really good!

Would definitely do take-out here again, must also be jam packed late night after the bars close."}
{"text":"Its one the top 10 reasons to visit the Burgh again!  They have and make the best subs around."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! They give you ALOT of fries. I consider myself a French fries fanatic and I love to eat a bunch - which they happily supply. And BONUS. If you dine in, you get free fries!! I always get the chicken cheesesteak. I've been several times now, and it has been consistently delicious every single time. I really love the consumer service, everyone is so friendly and kind. And I like the set up of the restaurant. I'd give it five stars, but sometimes it's not the cleanest (like the tables could be wiped down or something). It's usually hit or miss. But I do see them cleaning sometimes so idk. Also it's basically cash only, however if you have a debit card you can use their card machine as an ATM to pay. It's a little complicated but do-able. Overall I really enjoy this place and is my monthly lunch \"treat.\""}
{"text":"I love the steak subs and steak salads from Uncle Sam's. This is the best place to get a Philly steak style steak salad which is a favorite of mine. The bread is pretty good and subs come with a side of fries. Everything is made right in front of you and then brought to your table.This is a good place for a relaxed bite when you want something better than fast food but without having to go to a traditional sit down restaurant. I am tempted to try the chicken \"steak style\" sub the next time I go, my boyfriend is a big fan of it. 

Cons - Cash only, will not give you French fries with a to go order but make you pay the same price as eating in and can also slack on the cleaning at times."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The cheesesteaks were okay, but not great, the fries were meh, the mushrooms were canned. But, the sweet potato fries were inedible because the oil they were cooked in was either burned or old. They smelled and tasted nasty. On top of all that, the restaurant was dirty. The tables weren't wiped down and there was food debris and condiment stains on the tables.

The worst sin was when I asked for cheese whiz on my steak and the server told me that was disgusting - by the way, that cheese sauce they serve (and charge extra for) IS cheese whiz. Never tell a former Philly girl that whiz on a cheese steak is disgusting!

I won't be back."}
{"text":"As good as it was 20 years ago...cheeseburger sub with mushrooms please...a classic!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sams used to be a major part of my diet (I lived right around the corner). The subs are good, but tend to induce comas and heart attacks. The bread is nice, and generally the ingredients are fresh. The inside is clean and friendly. The only real complaint I have is that most of the subs all taste the same (maybe it's the shared grill?), which isn't bad, just boring."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!  We all eat at uncle same submarines, sams submarines, sams submarines.

To the best of my knowledge this is the original location but there are others.  The employees have been there as long as I can remember and that's a testament to this company.  Consistency in employees usually means consistency in your food which creates consistency in my visits.  They have a range of subs but let's be honest, we're coming for a steak hoagie or the alternate chicken steak with peppers, onions lettuce tomato and mayo on what's possibly a hoagie roll sent from heaven.  The sit in orders come with free shoe string fries made fresh to order, if you get a order to go though, the fries are extra.

I know you're probably like, ok it's a steak sub but, it's more spiritual than physical.  It's always exactly the same and I've eaten here at least a few dozen times, any true Pittsburgher has and every out of towner should.  Other than a Roethlisburgher at Peppis or Of course a Primantis Sandwich, I think this would complete the city limits PGH triple threat sandwich staple, I know, it's debatable.  I dare you to eat one of each in one day!

Hitt's Triple Sandwich Challenge 
Peppis -Roethlisburger 
Primantis - Pittsburgh Steak
Uncle SAMs - Steak & Cheese with Pep+Oni"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Subs in Pittsburgh. Very cheap (less than $10) and the food is excellent. Can get crowded and loud, but that also means something right? It's probably because I stick with my standard, but I feel like something is missing...
For a quick bite or lunch, you certainly can get a satisfying meal here!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Sandwiches are big, but very greasy. The place feels dirty and the sandwiches basically just taste like grease and cheap bread. Last time I ate there, I got very ill and puked about an hour later. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that is typical, but it is enough to make me not want to eat there ever again. Given the choice between this and Primantis, i'd pick Primantis."}
{"text":"It's a little dirty, like there's some trash on the floor, and the wood paneling on the side of the table is pealing off, and bathroom lock looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years (if ever), the floor by the soda fountain is a little sticky.

And the website is outdated, their homepage talks about \"delivery through Wheel Deliver\".  Which doesn't even exist anymore, in 2017 Wheel Deliver scammed a bunch of people out of money.  Uncle Sam's just hasn't updated their website yet.

And it's annoying that they only take cash.

BUT, they still get a solid 4 stars because man do they make a good sandwich!  Just delicious, good bread, a little greasy, but just delicious.  And a decent price consider it comes with fries."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly people working there.  Good cozy place.

It's a few bucks more than subway, but well worth the extra cost, much fresher ingredients.  The bread, the meat, the lettuce, it's all just fresher and better.

Perfect fries, like not soggy or burn or anything, just perfect.  And they give a good amount of fries.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Elevator Review: Great subs. Great sandwiches. Surprisingly great fries! 

I am a huge Uncle Sam's fan (and so is my 4 year old!). 

While their big sellers are the cheese steaks (which are great!), I personally love a hot turkey sub (hot turkey, grilled onions, cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato). The bread is fresh and the ingredients always taste high-quality. And I have to give credit to the folks behind the counter - they keep things moving and the wait never seems too long. 

I only have two issues: 
First, the cash-only policy is inconvenient. 
Second, I sometimes have to hunt for a clean table."}
{"text":"I've only been there once, so take this for what it's worth. I was in Squirrel Hill yesterday looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and saw this spot. They had a veggie portabella sub which caught my eye. I'm an omnivore, but was feeling like having something a little less heavy than the meat options, so I opted for this sandwich.

Big mistake! This portabella sandwich with provolone tasted more like Chinese food on a roll than anything close to an Italian sandwich. The mushrooms were fried in way too much corn oil, fully saturating the bread to the point where it couldn't be held together as a sandwich. The provolone cheese was very low quality - pretty much tasteless and did nothing for me. 

I find that often sandwich shops will have a vegetarian option just for the purpose of offering herbivores something edible while their friends enjoy the \"real\" menu. The fact that a sandwich lacks meat shouldn't have to mean that it lacks flavor. If you guys are knowingly making vegetarian sandwiches that you wouldn't eat, that's not a symptom of them being veggie sandwiches but a demonstration of your lack of willingness to take the time to figure out how to make a tasty veggie option.

Figure it out!"}
{"text":"The smell of onions greets you and the hype does not disappoint. This incredibly well-accessible sub shop was my boyfriend's personal favorite when he was going to school at Carnegie Mellon, and for good reason. This place can mix up some fantastic flavors to make an ordinary sub seem better than the traditional competition. They really pile on the toppings and their best kept secret might be the tasty bread they use. 

Dr. Pepper on the fountain, which always spells, \"I actually care about my customers.\"

Seriously, what did they put in this ordinary salami sub to make it taste so $@#%*ing good? Quiznos and Subway should take note, this isn't your run-of-the-mill sub shack."}
{"text":"Great food. 

However...

On both of my visits I've watched the staff eat french fries out of the hot french fry holding bin (beside the deep fryers) with their bare hands -- keep working -- and then eat more fries from hot holding bin.

So -- if you eat french fries at Uncle Sam's Waterworks be aware that you are sharing your fries with the staff. 

Cash only. That's just stupid."}
{"text":"Good food! You can get a variety of sandwiches here. I'm especially a fan of the French fries. This is a cash only restaurant. However, it is nice that they have an ATM machine connected to their cash register to provide cash for customers. The space is a little cramped, but you can always take your food to go."}
{"text":"I got a portabella sub and it was fantastic.  Looks like these folks know how to make a sub.  My husband had the cheese sub and he loved it too."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really love Uncle Sam's subs and the Oakland shop has the best fries of all their locations.  But the place is filthy and really needs some TLC. I don't understand why this is the only location that has been neglected. Come on, get some hot soapy water and give the place a good cleaning.  The bathrooms on the other hand need a lot more attention."}
{"text":"Someone once told me that you could tell that a restaurant was exception from the fact that it was cash only. Why else would customers (especially college students) put up with the inconvenience? Uncle Sam's is the proof of this.

I came here a lot to order the ultra uncle sam's special and it was phenomenal. The beef is super juicy, it's loaded with cheese, onions and peppers. The bread is great and if you keep it around too long it'll soak up all of the meat juice and fall apart on your lap. But it's sooo good. And they give you all of the fries you could ever ask for.

Top notch place. It's also right by a PNC ATM (though there's an ATM inside too if you want to pay a ridiculous fee). And right by the Murray and Forbes bus stop. So good. Definitely stop by for a meal."}
{"text":"Dine in and you get fries too. Cash only. They take debit though but I think there's a $1 surcharge.

PEPPER STEAK ($7.45): Was $7.45 but you end up paying $9 after tax + surcharge (I paid with card). I got it without cheese but it still tasted bomb. Portion sizes are pretty big! They ask if you want lettuce, mayo, and tomato. I like the thin fries, not too greasy and addicting.

I've dined here multiple times and food has been consistent. Portion sizes are always abundant so you should be full from a cheesesteak and fries.

I think that this location is better than the Sq. Hill one (that one smells like eggs, lol). It is next to all of the other food spots on Forbes on Pitt campus."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's gets the award for best cheese steak in the Burgh. This was a frequent lunch stop for me when I worked in the area. As I recall they only take cash so, if you only have a card on you, rob a bank or something because you do not want to miss out on this. Cheese steaks are top-notch but if you get there earlier in the day try the provolone and egg sub as a special breakfast treat. Then go back for lunch.... and dinner.

Tip: You must add sweet potato fries to your order - I think this is actually a law in all 50 states."}
{"text":"Subs. They've got 'em. The bread they use - is special, if you like it - you will like their subs, if you don't you will complain that the subs are weird. They do close pretty early, and many days they will close 15-30 minutes before it actually says they do, because they run out of bread.

Also, don't get your food to go - because if you eat it there - you get free fries with every sub, if you do takeout - you gotta pay for those fries (and they only take cash, and I mean you can't really even pay for the fries since you never have enough cash with you anyway)."}
{"text":"I actually can't believe that I have never written a review for this place. My husband and I go every Friday the 13th. Plus more days :) We LOVE the cheese steaks. Seriously best cheese steaks in Pittsburgh. 
We usually get them to go in which case you have to pay for the fries. If you eat there the fries come with your food. 
We have been to a lot of the Uncle Sams locations but Squirrel Hill is the best. Parking is a pain but we deal. They have high chairs which is great if you bring a kiddo."}
{"text":"I'm glad to be able to revisit this staple food joint after decades away from Pittsburgh area. Tucked in the same spot in Squirrel Hill amongst sprouting newer restaurants on Forbes the sub shop still serves the same consistently tasty and good quality hoagies that I remembered from years past. The extra mushroom sub was always my favorite -- mushrooms are always nicely marinated and juicy, and the steak were thinly sliced and cooked to the right flavors without getting too dry. Always a delight to experience seemingly simple but nicely executed hoagie here!"}
{"text":"They do cheesesteaks really well here. I even prefer them to Peppi's. The steak is fresh and thinly sliced so it melts in your mouth. The lettuce is always fresh and added right before being brought out so it's not wilted. The bread is of good quality and is nice and chewy.

Their fries are of the shoelace variety, thin and crispy and while they aren't my most preferred version of the French fry I still love them. They salt them for you and always put a good amount. Perfect when dipped in ketchup or some Frank's Red Hot. I also enjoy the mint that's hiding beneath your pile of complimentary fries.

Wish they'd get rid of the \"cash only\" policy at most of their locations. Kind of outdated and only serves as an inconvenience. Also, what's with paying 50 cents for a refill? That stuff costs them like 5 cents, I wouldn't be surprised if a small cup holds about 1 penny's worth of coke syrup. Luckily, I ignore the sign and have never been challenged when going for a free refill.

The service is fine, there's really nothing to it. Order and then have your food brought to you. I've yet to have a problem."}
{"text":"This is definitely our favorite sub shop in Pittsburgh! The quality of food is way better than the Oakland location. The staff is friendly and professional! They also accommodate my boyfriend's vegetarian request to segregate his sub from the other meat subs on the grill."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

Moving to Pittsburgh, everyone here says the place I gotta try first is Uncle Sam's.  Best in Pittsburgh and better than Philadelphia's.  ATM, I agree.

First time there, I tried their ultimate(?) cheesesteak.  It has double the meat, mushrooms, bellpepers, onions, and so on.  We added an egg to the sub as well.   It was too darn good.  I love it.  I also love the fries and the bottle of cajun seasoning they let us dump onto the fries.

Would be 5 stars if their dining area didn't look/feel dirty.  I'm not trying anything else on the menu until I get sick of these cheesesteaks.  But i'm going to agree with Pittsbooghers and say their philly cheesesteaks is the best I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Always delicious. I always get the Chicken Caesar Sub, not available at all locations. Cash only."}
{"text":"LOVE! Uncle Sams is awesome. My go to place for a cheesesteak. The people are nice at both locations that I visit (Oakland & SQ Hill). Best cheese fries, I would say they are worthy to rival potato patch (maybe lol). The downside is they are cash only and I do not always want to run to the ATM. Oh also the Oakland location does not have cheese fries. Shame on you..."}
{"text":"Not the nicest inside but the food is filling and fantastic. A restaurant that captures the essence of Oakland."}
{"text":"I have two big qualms with this place:
1) You do not get fries unless if you eat-in. Now really, how hard/expensive is it to include fries w/to-go orders?
2) The Oakland location CHARGES for re-fills.. Considering they have probably marked up the softdrinks by 1000+% to begin with, I find this ridiculous.

The actual subs are decent, but I don't find them to be as good as everyone says they are. Overrated + my admittedly somewhat petty complaints above = I do not jump at the chance to go there."}
{"text":"General rule: if you have to wait more than 15 minutes for a sub at a place that appears to be take out, then it's not a good business. If I wanted to wait for a meal I'd go to a sit down restaurant with waiter service. I've been waiting 40 min for a sandwich I could get across the street at Jimmy Johns in less than 5 minutes. Don't come here unless you have nothing better to do than sit and wait for a sub-par sub."}
{"text":"For all the business that this place does, it really needs a clean up and face lift.  No complaints about the food but it's a dive that doesn't serve alcohol, has a lame cola fountain and is cash only. C'mon folks, get with the times."}
{"text":"We had a buffet there. The shrimp and meat balls are great. They're fresh. And the is seasoning just appreciate. Except for that, nothing special."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place of all time.  Pretty cheap and always high quality.  Service is usually very fast as well!"}
{"text":"I usually get the mushroom cheesesteak.  Nice sub with mouthwatering steak, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and sub dressing.  Also you get a bunch of fries which is a treat especially if they are hot.  You can also grab a bottle of Two Hearted to enjoy.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because the food is always great. However, while there today I saw a mouse crawl around the counter. I told the staff and they acted so nonchalantly about it. They just told me \"I hope it left because I don't see it haha\"  I lost my appetite and threw away my food and left. Completely unacceptable. Unfortunately I am not forward enough to ask for my money back but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The best cheesesteaks the the P.G.H...Fries are great. All locations are good.Oakland is the best..Food never bad."}
{"text":"Really mondo cheese steaks with high quality beef. I had the ultra pepper (meaning extra meat), but the peppers part of it was lacking both in quantity and bite. Their roll was really good, and held up for 24 hours later when I actually developed enough of an appetite after the first half to finally tackle the second half! The fries were good and overall a pretty good value given the amount of food.

Maybe it just wasnt dripping enough or greasy enough, but I think it wasn't as decadent as I like in my cheesesteaks. Then again, it was almost worth missing the 1000 point drop in the Dow that day.

(ps. I actually ate at the one at the Waterworks Mall.)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Quick services. A staple on campus at Pitt. many years always a must get to before my visit is over."}
{"text":"Oakland staple for many many years. The original Uncle Sam worked the grill for many years. This place is a don't miss place if your in Pittsburgh. The boys have kept the awesome tradition going very nicely.  Uncle Sam special is my fav. But you can't go wrong anywhere. Fries always cooked to perfection. It's a no frills place. And always busy. So yeah maybe a little crabby but hey it's Pittsburgh. You take the crab with the good."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall that could probably use a good scrub or two, but if you're letting that keep you from trying Uncle Sam's, you're missing out. You're also missing out if you refuse to eat cheesesteaks that aren't from the other side of the state. This cheesesteak is different than what you'd find in Philadelphia, but on it's own merit, it's a great sandwich.

I'm particularly fond of the mushroom cheesesteak with lettuce, onion, tomato, and mayo. The steak itself is tasty, and the toppings add a nice variety to it. The sanwiches are stuffed pretty well, and one visit will usually leave me with half a sandwich to take home for later. You get free fries with your sub if you eat in, but you'll be charged if you want them with a takeout order. They're thin and crispy, and you will get a lot of them. No matter what you order, come here hungry.

It's cash only, but you can use their mini ATM if you don't mind fees. Refills on pop are 50 cents. The cajun seasoning for your fries always comes out of the bottle faster than I want and makes my fries too spicy. These are the only real issues I've had over the years.

Uncle Sam's makes a darn tasty sandwich that will leave you full and happy when you leave. It is an essential entry on any list of Oakland lunch spots."}
{"text":"The mushroom cheesesteak is really good, they add lettuce, tomato and onion which makes for a different flavor experience. The fries are your regular run of the mill fries but their sandwiches make up for it! Staff wasn't very friendly but we will definitely be back because the food was great!"}
{"text":"I used to love Uncle Sams subs back when I worked in Pittsburgh. I was happy to be able to get one on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. Alas it's charm has faded. They no longer server sweet potatoe fries, which was one of the great things about this place. As someone who is allergic to white potatoes, this change was very disappointing. Subs are still good though."}
{"text":"Usually love their food, but the employees are very unwelcoming. We walked in at 8:05pm and were greeted with frowns and groans, they close at 9 btw. We walked out and went next store where we were greeted with a smile and hello. My one star is not for the food, but the rude behavior."}
{"text":"I want to review the Waterworks Uncle Sam's location, since I feel it's the best in the area by far. The Oakland one is filthy and poorly maintained, so I've never returned to it after my initial trip there. The Squirrel Hill one is cleaner but too often filled with children acting like wild animals. This location has less seating than the other two, but it's much cleaner and seems at least a decade newer. Not to mention, they have bottled beer! The prices aren't terrible, and they usually have decent options such as Dogfish, Bell's, and Magic Hat. Being able to crack a beer with my sandwich puts this Uncle Sam's head and shoulders above the others imo. It might get crowded during busy times, but I've only ever gone before a Monday night movie at the adjacent theater and it's been fine."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's is an awesome, cheap sub shop with throwback wooden chairs, free french fries if you're eating in, and classic brown mustard bottles for your table! (Mustard trumps Ketchup all the way!) My boyfriend and I eat here a lot on summer weekends especially, since parking and walking in Squirrel Hill is so gross during the winter. The subs here are fairly simple with plenty of vegetable toppings, and I never leave feeling sick from overly greasy food. The friendly staff also wrap up any leftovers you may have, which is a great service to offer! It cuts down on the mess of everyone doing it themselves, and it's super convenient when you're a pixie like me and can't always finish your entire meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Uncle Sams in Pittsburgh. As an undergrad. nothing hit the spot better than a greasy steak sandwich with extra greasy fries (in a good way). This place is tucked away on a side street but they make great stuff. If i ever had a rough day or was starving this was my go to spot.

The steaks are cooked right in front of you and the aroma from the grill lifts you off your feet. For around $10 you can get a full sub and fries. The fries are always glistening with oil but are pretty good. Eating here with definitely give you the \"meat sweats\".

There are quite a few tables inside so it's good for groups or to eat in duos/solo. It can get a little hot in there so i'd advise dressing light or taking it to go (if you can hold out from the smell)

Definitely a go to spot if you're in Oakland and want a true hit your stomach hard steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just a hater for all subs that are not Jimmy Johns. But I find these subs to be just okay. However, they could have just been over hyped and so I wasn't blown away by them when I first tried.

I've tried the cappicola and philly cheese steak. Like I said, they were good but not amaaaaaazing. 

One great perk tho is that if you sit and eat inside, you get free fries with your order. Also, if you're considering Uncle Sam's you should check what the special is for the day. They have different deals everyday that are really sweet deals!

Another tip is that they only take cash! I know this particular location has a PNC bank/ATM right next door but for those that don't have PNC, they also have a generic ATM inside."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. It's one of the few places I can say I've been going to for more than half of my life. Hands down in my opinion the best hoagie/sub in the city. Among the best French fries in the city. Prices are pretty good considering the quality and amount of food. 

So what's so good? I always get the ultra mushroom cheesesteak hoagie. The untoasted sandwich bread has a gentle sweetness to it and always has the perfect moisture content, the cheesesteak is made from fresh beef right in front of you, and the free dine-in fries are prime time.  Add in a little Heinz and Frank's Red Hot... Uhhhmaaaagaawwwwwddsss. It's the kind of good that you force yourself to continue eating even though you're full, you fat American. Do your central nervous system a favor and swing by. I'd elaborate more but I'm here right now and have to stuff my face."}
{"text":"The steak & egg sub, and sweet potato fries are must-haves."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheesesteak in Pittsburgh. A must for a quick lunch. You will not be disappointed with The mouthwatering experience."}
{"text":"Good cheese steaks and good environment! Just disappointed that they don't have sweet potato fries any more."}
{"text":"I had a day off from work today and since I've been looking for a good sandwich place since Kazansky's closed, I thought I'd try Uncle Sam's.  Believe me folks, the subs here are ridiculously large.  I know that Uncle Sam's is known for their fries but that's why I skipped them.

I went for the salami and cheese sub which was pretty tasty.  But I guess subs don't do it for me like a good sammitch does!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for relatively cheap.  Simple interior and typical sandwich-shop atmosphere.  The wait time can get a little long during busy times, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"30 minutes to get your sandwich. Really? This place sucks! You can starve to death before you get your food."}
{"text":"I used to come here pretty frequently in my college days and was happy to note that nothing's changed on a recent visit.

Simple menu - cheesesteaks and their variants. I like the mushroom cheesesteak. Pretty big portions. Eat in so you can get free french fries! 

The interior is basic. I like that they have various pictures of Pittsburgh's past. One nice innovation over my college days is that they sortuv take credit. It's technically an ATM transaction (with a $1 fee) but at least you don't have to use straight cash homie."}
{"text":"Best bread in da burgh!  Many stillers frequent this place."}
{"text":"Not sure about the food handling practices here. Man who is ringing up take outs and handling the cash is also going directly to the grill and handling food. When i queried him about this, he grumbled, with downcast eyes, \"i wash my hands.\" Then to demonstrate, he walked to the opposite end  of the counter and he did, but not before elbowing his manager and having s good laugh together. The manager then looked at me and was rather abashed when he saw me watching.  Id suggest you watch your sub being made to see if food handling is up to your standards."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's specializes in cheesesteaks, and that's all I've gotten so far during the three times that I've gone here in 3 months.

Here's the breakdown:
Meat - Mediocre.  Not distinctive/nothing special. my friend and i usually grab the seasoning on the side table and season each bite we take with that seasoning + black pepper.

veggie/meat ratio = just right. this is one of the more important factors when it comes to a delicious cheesesteak, imo. you need the greens to help regulate the meatiness.

bread: a tad heavy/thick for my taste, but the fact that it doesn't get soggy satisfies me very much so. too many times, I've tasted a cheesesteak where the bread was starting to melt with the juices coming from the meat inside.

i'm also a huge fan of sweet potato fries, and i would say that they do them very well! some people cut them too short and fry them too long to the point that the sweetness got completely fried out of existence.  the thickness of the cut of each sweet potato fry, along with the length in which they fry these things for makes for a perfect sweet potato fry! i'd come here simply for the sweet potato fries. too bad you can't substitute the regular fries that come with your cheesesteak with the sweet potato fries. you have to get them separately. if you make the mistake of not realizing this and tell the cashier you want a cheesesteak with sweet potato fries, prepare to eat a lot of fries (to me, it's a dream come true until my next blood test)."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot back in high school and I loved this place.  It's got great subs and - if I recall correctly - pretty good soup too.  The fries are some of the best I've ever had, plus you've got the option of the sweet potato fries which is a nice touch.

As I've gotten older and come here more infrequently (I've left Pittsburgh for school), I've thought about some things...Do they have vegetarian options? - I don't think so...What's up with the charge for a refill of the soft drinks?  Why is everything - the fries, the meat and even the bread greasy?  Yes, they don't take debit cards but there are two banks in each direction...so that's not a major issue.

Overall, the place is decent...with some tasty subs.  You'll see a lot of high school and college students in here.  I'd prefer to give it more of a 3.5 star rating...but I'm working with what I've got."}
{"text":"Been eating here for many years. Never had a bad experience and hope I never do. Parking is the only challenge but there are parking lots of residential parking that's a short walk. They have a sub, salad or sandwich for all taste buds. I love the mushroom cheese steak and when you dine in the fries are free. I eat half my sub and the fries then take the other half home for later. The bread is delicious. The subs are seasined to and cooked to perfection and the ingredients are fresh. I have been to all their Pittsburgh locations. Robinson and Waterworks are my favorites due to the ease of parking but I still frequent them all. The are affordable, good food and very filling. This is a place I recommend for a good Cheese steak if you want lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First time going to Uncle Sam's.  Enough food for 2 meals and the food is great!  The interior adds to the appeal, in my opinion!  The 70s decor is iconic and shows that the place has been around for a while and probably won't be going away soon.   My Italian sub is huge and grilled to perfection!  Fries are pretty high up on my list as well!"}
{"text":"I love Cheese steaks as you may have read from prior posts.  I have never been disappointed at Uncle Sam's. I have only been to this location and the one in the Waterworks in Aspinwall, next to another favorite place Burgatory. Uncle Sam's Submarines is located on Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill.  In my option this cheese steak is much better than any pizza shop steak hoagie and I think it is because Sam's specializes in great steak hoagies. The steaks are made in front of you, always fresh and never a so-so hoagie.  I like the fact that, If you eat in, you get free fries. I like the small thin shoestring fries, they remind me of the fries on the boardwalk. The staff here and in the Waterworks have always been friendly. I think that the price is very affordable for what you receive. The restaurant is always clean and I have never had a problem finding a seat. Yes it is CASH ONLY. Highly Recommend for a great Cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone geeks out over Uncle Sam's.  The subs are OKAAAYY, the fries are pretty good, you have to pay for refills and no credit cards?  What year is this?

Of course, sweet potato fries trump all of my complaints.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. It's okay but nothing that special and it's not consistent, some days it's good and some days it sucks. Service is usually rude and it takes forever to get your food. Just go to campus deli (not that their service is great either)"}
{"text":"Strong Pre-Game Primanti's Substitue Sandwich!

Been to Pittsburgh more than a few times, and it was always the tourist trap Primanti's or what has been called the best restaurant in town Nakama Japanese.  This time I went with a suggestion from some other Pittsburghers.

Not that Primanti's or Nakama are bad at all, but it was just time for a change.

Enter: Uncle Sam's Subs.  Been around since the early 70's so you would think they know what they are doing, and they in fact do.

Don't get me wrong, you are not going to be blown away by anything they do here, but you will get a pretty damn good sandwich & fries for under $10.

I went with the cheese steak/mushrooms, and as others have said here, it will not disappoint.

Order up, sit down, they bring you the sandwich and a side of fries in minutes. 

Wrap up;

Certainly not a gourmet restaurant, but a real good sandwich real quick for real cheap.  Also a lighter (a lead brick would be lighter) than a Primanti's monster!"}
{"text":"The bread.  The bread for these subs is what makes them really really good.  It has the right level of chewyness, crustiness, and saltiness for the subs.  The insides of the subs are as good as any other place, but the bread is really what makes these subs delicious.  

Look, at the end of the day, what do you expect out of a sub place?  Ambience?  Decor?  This place delivers where it needs to.  I dont care about the fries, which are fine standard steak fries but can be greasy.   Remember, its the bread that makes this place so delicious."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam is a decent, if not spectacular, sub shop. 
We were at the Squirrel Hill location today and ordered a couple of \"ultra\" subs for takeout, along with fries. It was lunch time but their line is pretty efficient so the wait was reasonable.
I had ordered the 'hot pepper' sub, but I didn't taste or find any in my sub; I suppose they were too busy to put some on. 
Uncle Sam has fresh buns, but they don't toast them, which means that the sandwich gets soggy over time (I guess if we ate in this may not have been a factor).
The fries were good, a cut above (most?) every other place in the neighborhood; unfortunately they seem to use frozen fries rather than bothering to double-fry fresh potatoes (of course I've discovered that they don't always bother to do that in Belgium either).
Anyway: best subs in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a sandwich. I order the Ultra Philly cheesesteak with everything. I got my order and the sandwich was cut into 2 big pieces. If you eat at the restaurant you get free fries, but you will be filled just from the sandwich itself. The cheesesteak was great. The steak was cut properly and every bite seem better than the last."}
{"text":"good food, ok service."}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE PEOPLE AT COUNTER. 
Brian is very rude and the young girls are rude too.
Very expensive and just okay subs. 
If you do take out, you don't get fries. Only if you eat in. 
For $2.09, you can give fries...esp when there are little kids there.
RUDE AND NOT WORTH IT!!!! Better subs around here! And nicer people too!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some meat in your life.  Sometimes, as a college student, you try to save money and avoid buying meat.  Sometimes, you lose this battle and end up at Uncle Sam's.

I ordered a cheese steak sub ($7.44 including tax) to go.  It was delicious!  They actually put a decent amount of cheese on, and the lettuce, tomato, and mayo were put on in balance with the rest of the sandwich.  There are other sandwich choices that looked good as well, and the sandwiches are made pretty fast.  The workers were super nice, and I will definitely come back to try out more options!

CASH ONLY!  (PNC is on the same block, there is an ATM in the store, and Citizens is over 2 blocks.)"}
{"text":"I love to stop here before a basketball game!  Good, quick food and not nearly as crowded as Primantis.   Order at the counter and then they'll bring your meals to your table.  When you eat in, you get free fries with your sub.   One meal is huge, so I prefer to share but it's good enough to eat a whole!    And the bread is excellent.   I just wish they put hot sauce on every table as I'm usually searching it out in the dining area.

Bring cash!!"}
{"text":"YUM! I got a pepper steak Philly cheese steak and my boyfriend got the steak and mushroom. Both were so great and moist, but at times was a little lacking in flavor. The meat could have been spiced more (more salted, even), but they make up for it with the crunchy yet chewy bread and delicious fries. 

They have this great mysterious spice that you can throw onto your fries and your sandwich -- it's in an orange container with the salt. I have no idea what it is but it is ridiculously yummy and makes your fries finger lickin' good!"}
{"text":"Not bad and you get a great amount of food for a good price.. however, they are cash only :( I remember them having bottled beer though, so that kind of makes up for it.. No not really.. especially because i dont remember them having an ATM. We walked to giant eagle to go to the ATM. Idk why some Uncle Sam's take cards while others dont."}
{"text":"I love cheese steaks. Im pretty sure most uncle sams  throughout the city have a 4 star review from me. This uncle sams is no different. We decided to head to sq hill despite already being in Oakland. Oakland location doesn't feel clean plus it is always crowded with college kids (no hate).

 This location was nearly empty. The workers were kind and as always the cheesesteak was plump & full of goodness. We always get the ultra mushroom cheesesteak and its delicious. One meal can be shared. Free fries when you dine in. Cash only but there's an atm.

Other locations include Robinson, Aspinwall (waterworks) & Oakland. If you haven't had a cheese steak from here, you're missing out"}
{"text":"it has been 2.5 years since my review of uncle sams. ive eaten many cheesesteaks since then... here and their other locations--- Waterworks, Sq. Hill & Robinson. Each shop makes a similar cheesesteak. Ive personally never ever had a bad one from uncle sams. They may even be a smidge bit better than Peppi's. 

My go to at uncle sams is the ultimate mushroom cheesesteak which is served with extra steak, mushrooms, sautéed onions, lettuce and tomato. The size of the cheesesteak is huge. We normally split it. You get free fries when you dine in. $10 to feed 2 people is a great deal.

there are a few reasons why my update is offering the same amount of stars. This shop seems very old. Its dark and a little dingy. The booths in the back dining area are slanted.. im assuming they were built like that but it is not comfy. Speaking of dining room, its nearly impossible to find a clean table. there are always open ones available, but they are always dirty. finally, the staff here are mostly college kids.. worried about gossiping with coworkes and texting while you are trying to order.

every other uncle sams location is a solid 4 (if not 5) stars. this location is convenient to me and the sub is fabulous, but gosh the dirtiness makes me cringe. 

ATM style for cards.. some uncle sams don't even take cards (waterworks) so that's a plus."}
{"text":"These are the best subs I've had in Pittsburgh. It might be sacrilege to dislike Primanti's, but soggy fries shoved in a sandwich that falls apart are not my favorite. At Uncle Sam's, on the other hand, you get delicious, hot, crispy fries on the side, and your sub is also freshly grilled and delicious. Try the chicken cheesesteak--it's amazing (and I don't even like sandwiches normally)."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my friend Dan we both had the fish subs they where we'll made. \"I like that the fish is not sticking out way over the bun\". Service again was right on!"}
{"text":"They list their hours as until 9:00, but they took the phone off the hook before 8:30...assuredly to avoid taking my orders."}
{"text":"Last night, upon taking off work, I was super-hungry and was craving a (hot) sandwich, so I decided to head over to Uncle Sam's.  Since most of the menu options appeared to be variations on cheesesteaks, I decided to go with a basic chicken cheesesteak ($8.13 w/ tax), given that I don't eat beef.  From reading other Yelp reviews, I knew the sandwich came with free fries for dine in, so I mentioned that I wanted to do this.

When my sandwich and fries came out after about 10 min., they looked very fresh and tempting, so I was excited to dig in.  When I did so, I was underwhelmed, however.  The bread was light and fluffy, rather than substantial, as I prefer, the tomatoes were pretty white, and the chicken was on the tough side.  The flavors were so muted and bland that I sequestered all of the condiments (hot sauce, cajun spice, brown mustard) and put them to use, which significantly improved the sandwich.  As for the fries, they were of the previously frozen shoestring variety (I saw the box)--similar to McD's fries, but not as crisp--and were utterly forgettable sans condiments.

Interestingly, this place seems to be a haven for single male grad students during the dinner hour.  In the 30 min. or so I was there, I was the only female who ate in--all of the other diners were solo men in their mid-twenties with textbooks in front of them. In contrast, there were plenty of women, couples, groups, etc. dining at Noodles and Co. a block away. Maybe cheesesteaks for dinner are a dude thing?

At the time of my visit, I found the dining area acceptably clean, and the service friendly and fairly efficient.  This is likely due to the time of my visit (5:30pm), however, since Uncle Sam's is probably much more popular at lunch time.  Thus, YMMV.

Given that I'm from DE, where Capriotti's originated, I have exacting sandwich standards, and I have yet to find a place in PGH that satisfies them.  While Uncle Sam's is a cut above Subway, it isn't quite as good as Peppi's, which I also found underwhelming, despite its good reputation.  Thus, my search for a satiating sandwich continues..."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

The portions are massive. I got the ultra mushroom cheesesteak, and combined with the fries it was more than enough for 1, maybe 2 meals if you're not particularly hungry.

The fries are thin and abundant. I don't remember them being particularly crispy. They weren't really memorable.

The sandwich was full of meat, cheese, and mushrooms. The bun was large but squished easily, so it didn't feel like the bread-to-content ratio of the sandwich was too high.

It's nice that it's walking distance from the Pitt campus. They don't seem to mind if you bring multiple tables together to accommodate a larger group, either.

All in all, a good place to get a cheesesteak. The sandwich was good, and the serving sizes are pretty big."}
{"text":"Never disappointed at Uncle Sam's. The portions are good, the steak is better than any pizza shop steak hoagie I've had. If you eat in, you get free fries. The staff was quiet, but nonetheless friendly. Actually got a window seat for the first time, and it was a Saturday. I have a very finicky 13 year old daughter, brought her here years ago and remember her being dismayed that they didn't offer chicken fingers lol. Now, that's not a problem. Even though she got the cheesesteak plain, it looked and apparently tasted pretty darn good. You get a lot of food for the price. Definitely worth it if you're in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I would probably choose Uncle Sam's over Primanti Bros any day. The subs are much tastier and filling here, but at the same time they are not overly greasy or messy like those at Primanti. If you get the options with lots of veggies or meat, you'll get what you want. One sub plus free fries will definitely fill you up for less than $10. And speaking of the fries, I actually consider them the best part. Crisp, thin-cut, and not at all soggy. Put them in your sandwiches if you want to, but I prefer mine separate, and they do that right here."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as the Squirrel Hill location. Lots of different variations on the fillings that go into the cheesesteaks, but no matter which one you get I'd probably say it's the best you can find in Oakland. These are huge sandwiches, and even with one of the basic ones I struggled to finish the whole thing in one sitting. But it's super tasty, with lots of meat, cheese, veggies, and whatever other fillings you get. The bread is nice and soft as well, and I am a fan of the fries that come with the sandwich if you are eating in. Definitely worth it for a cheap meal, even if it's not the cleanest or most inviting place inside."}
{"text":"Don't expect to be feeling good about yourself after a trip to Uncle Sams. This is the epitome of Pittsburgh fare. A true hole in the wall with questionable hygiene standards. Nevertheless, the food is actually quite good...much better than the Oakland branch of Primanti Bros across the street. They give you a ton of food here with just the right amount of grease. Steak is grilled nicely and the fries are the closest thing to McDonald's I have ever seen. Overall a good experience, but wouldn't want to make a habit of coming to this place...unless you have a burning desire to raise your BMI a few points. Make sure to bring cash. They accept debit..for a price."}
{"text":"Everything a sub place should be.

Perfect fries. How many other places can you honestly say that about? Its always too oily or too salty or too big. But never here at Uncle Sam's!

Uncle Sam's special was hearty enough to feed both of us - fresh bread, plenty of LTM and yummy steak & cheese. Warm and filling. And fast too. Love it.

Only complaint was that the tea was obviously forgotten about during the brewing process... too bitter. Not sure if that's my texan southern tea high expectations talking though."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a restaurant like this can be cash only?!?! Get with the times you nerds"}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to go for sandwiches on a rough morning after drinking. I always get the italian special and am never disappointed by the food. And the free fries for dining in are delicious! However, the girls who work the register are always so rude. The worst part is that they wear the Uncle Sam's uniform that says they offer \"Free friendly service.\" Talk about false advertising. The people making the food are always pretty cool, but come on, if your one job is to greet people and take their money, at least don't be a complete jerk about it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Uncle Sams!! These subs are massive and super filling though, so make sure you come hungry. The sandwiches all come on 12 inch(Ish?) hoagie buns. As far as I know, you can't get 6 inch sandwiches. They have a lot of options for vegetarians as well, and those options aren't boring! Both hot and cold subs available, and they also have a veggie burger sub which is my personal favorite. You get a choice of cheese on each sub and also lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo. They ask each time so it's best to think it over beforehand. 

The subs are served with fries and the fries are some of the best fries in town. They are shoestring type fries and go down like air which is a delicious yet dangerous combination. They are deep fried in peanut oil, so those that are allergic should be advised not to try them. They also have waffle fries and sweet potato fries. I still love the regular fries the best, however! There is a seasoning I love to put on them by the counter. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Uncle Sam Sub's a go.  I haven't been to this location in six years due to a bad experience I had.  The place looks clean and well organized, the staff were friendly, not very crowded, and the food was good.  I guess a lot can change in six years.  I'm glad I decided to give them another try.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"It is a great deal you get get a full sandwich and fries for less than 10 dollars. I usually order the secret menu item of a buffalo chicken sub, and the amount of heat on it is what I look for. Unfortunately, the place is not very clean so I felt 3 stars was a fair estimate. If it was cleaner, I would give it 4 stars.

Note that it is a cash only business"}
{"text":"Delicious subs!  Lots to choose from.  Quantity and quality for a reasonable price. Gets crowded around noon. Better to go earlier or later. Great place for subs!"}
{"text":"This place has good sandwiches but it never looks super clean to me. The fries are nothing special either. Overall not a huge fan."}
{"text":"I would only come here for the fries.

The chicken cheesesteak (yes, my standards are high since I'm from Philly) was so bland. The bread was porous and too big for the small amount of unseasoned chicken. I probably ate like 300 calories worth of hot sauce of ketchup to make up for it. And I think there was cheese- if it was there, I didn't taste it.

The regular and sweet potato fries are awesome. Besides that, the subs are not worth your calories. Well, at least the price was right."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a good hot sub in Pittsburgh, and another great place for large portions at decent price. 

Favorite is the cheesesteak with mushrooms and an extra egg on top. Fried egg on a sandwich is a must, especially this sandwich. The bread is more chewy than crusty, but for this sandwich it works well because the bread sucks up all the juices but doesn't get soggy. I've also tried their potato and egg sandwich. Really simple, but it tastes so good and satisfying.

For some reason all of their fries (classic fries, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, etc) taste so good. They're fresh, crispy, and nicely salted."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We've been coming here together for over three years and it's still a fantastic place to eat. The service is very friendly, and they've taken the time to memorize our order, which is just such a kind thing for them to go out of their way to do that we've marked this our to go lunch spot. The only pickle is that they don't take cards, but as that's several atm's around it's really no inconvenience to take some out. Plus, the food is delicious and perfectly priced for a nice lunch out!"}
{"text":"A great deal on a very tasty sub sandwich.  My favorite is probably the class italian sub, but i know lots of people who swear by the cheese-steak.  

if you dine in, you get a plate of fries with your sandwich (plus a mint hidden at the bottom of your fries, suprise!).  i love the atmosphere too, as the restaurant is covered with pictures of old pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! The WORST i've experienced in a long time - in fact, I don't think I've EVER been treated with such disrespect. I asked a simple question about what the person ordered who was with me and the young ladies working glared and cut eyes at me - awful attitudes. My guess is the 2 girls working must be related to same because there is no way anyone with common business sense would hire such disrespectful workers with no clue about offering acceptable, good customer service."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Sam's and have for over 10 years. One of the best sandwich shops in Pittsburgh, hands-down. I recommend the Hot Italian Sub with everything on it. :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken cheesesteak in the world.  Period.  And like everyone says, the fries obviously have liberal amounts of crack.  The waffle fries were even better, but I went back recently to find that they are not seasoned and not quite as good.  Minus one star for that."}
{"text":"Uncle Sams is awesome. See my review of the Squirrel Hill location here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/uncle-sams-submarines-pittsburgh-2#hrid:0awQicUktjE9OTtI5GTkPQ

This one is not quite a good as it's brother in Squirrel Hill.  Mainly because it is a bit more run down and no waffle fries."}
{"text":"I love this place.  All of the subs are excellent.  My experience has always been that they get your order right.  I personally like to call ahead for take out best.  It's ready in 15-20 minutes even on a Friday night at 6pm!! For take out you still get a generous portion of freshly fried French fries! Just make sure you have cash- they do not take credit cards! There is an ATM right beside the entrance."}
{"text":"What Yinzer doesn't like Uncle Sam's? With direct, but poor competitions in two other chains not too far, Uncle Sam's really has nothing to worry about in my opinion. 

Here are some reasons:

1) Weekday Specials
2) Free fries when you eat in (and even sometimes when you take out?)
3) Way better sliced meats
4) How does that bread get so shiny?!
5) Actual hot option as opposed to sticking it into a glorified toaster oven

Need I say more?? And I'm not even a sub/Italian/hoagie kind of guy. Fun fact: I have lived in each of the geographic regions represented by the above three names most commonly used for Uncle Sam's delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you ever visit Oakland, this is definitely a spot to stop in and enjoy a wonderful sub. The fries are just as tasty as the subs. Your cheesesteak will not be the same as you would get in Philly, but the difference is a good thing as it is not trying to compete with those flavors but rather create their own."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I have never had a Philly cheese steak... until now. 

I really liked the decor. It reminded me of a modern diner/ regular bar. The staff were really friendly and clean! Since they cook everything right in front of you, I expected their shirts to be dirty. I was pleasantly surprised! 

It was my first time eating a Philly cheese steak so it was hard for me to rate it. I didn't think they would give you such a long sandwich for only 6 dollars. I was full before I ate half the sub. The meat taste good but it was really dry. Are you suppose to put something else other than lettuce on a cheese steak sub? Overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"The philly w/ shrooms!! This left me more than full before my flight home. 

Pretty awesome place with cholula, and tapatio. Food was ready quick and everyone was nice."}
{"text":"Want a good sandwich check them out inexpensive beats anything at subway firehouse togos. Service was awesome friendly two guys and a girl. Only thing I wish they had was a haberno sauce sausage sub very good"}
{"text":"This place is not good. Maybe it was in the 80's but not today. Actually, the number of positive reviews for this dump is astounding. The sandwiches are tasteless, which is amazing given how greasy they are. And the bread is nasty. It's frozen, go there around 9pm to watch then pound it against the counter to break it apart. It's also super old looking, but not in that retro cool sort of way. More like that old run-down-dump sort of way. Do yourself a favor and go next door or across the street for some decent food."}
{"text":"Best chicken steaks sub I've ever had...I I like the chicken steak sub.  They used to have the best waffle fries but for some reason they changed them.  And waffle fry version 2.0 isn't as good as 1.0"}
{"text":"There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and I was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera, which had a line out the door.

Oh well."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, but you're getting what it looks like you're getting:  a sub with tons of cheese on it and greasy french fries (if you dine in, that is).  I get the Roma Veggie, so at least mine has broccoli on it...

I ate here with a coworker and they had two stacks of numbers going at once, but the numbers were the same, so everyone was getting the wrong subs--or no subs--and the whole place was a hot mess, since this was at noon on a Friday and lots of students and UPMC employees go out to lunch at that time.

We saw a lot of people complaining they got the wrong thing, and a lot of people having to bag up their lunch and go since they waited so long.  Not a good scene.

However, if you're in the mood for a real Pittsburgh sandwich and fries--and you're not in a hurry at all--this is your jam."}
{"text":"Ate here all the time at u of Pitt. Love it. Better than philly cheesesteaks and I lived near Philly for a few years. Don't walk run to uncle Sam's."}
{"text":"Went to college in Pittsburgh and this was one of my fave regular eats! What's not to love about a great sub, and Jeopardy playing on the TV while you eat? :)"}
{"text":"I only will go to Oakland Ave.....besides the taste the service is way better in Oakland . But service aside the whole flavor is off ......not the same"}
{"text":"Only Oakland!! Sq hill is 20 % the flavor........its all about 50 years of the grill taste!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I ate here at least once a week while going to school. Big steak hoagie. It will fill you up. Get one and a side of fries. Then split it with your girl. I have been back since graduating and will continue to go back when in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Great subs, but the place is filthy. Horrible service. Check out another location instead of this one. I've never seen food service staff move so quickly as when you walk in here at 20 mins. till closing time. They want you to inhale your food and get out. The have horrible Sunday hours too (close at 6 pm)"}
{"text":"An Oakland staple! I've heard great things about this place and oddly, in all my years in here I hadn't been there before today. I'm not typically a cheesesteak person, so I went with the turkey and cheese served hot. For $8 you get a very large sandwich and a side of fries so I had both lunch and dinner in one meal!

The fries are thin cut and fresh and the sandwich was good, so yeah, I'll say I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Eat there for free fries!
Best hangover cure since weed. 
\"I did WHAT last night??\""}
{"text":"Crazy delicious sandwich in close proximity to Pitt and Presby - if Real McCoy Sandwich Shop didn't exist, this place might win my heart for best cold sandwich in the city for their Italian Deluxe. Fresh meat sliced a little thicker than everywhere else, with fresh toppings and the right amount of mayo, all for a reasonable price. Every time I buy it I tell myself I'm only eating half and saving the rest, and every time I turn into a liar. The personal shame is so worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite cheesesteak in Pittsburgh. Love the bread, the steak is acceptable and it's usually pretty fast. To pay with a card is kind of clunky and annoying (it's an ATM machine thing...) but the food is great. The service is most of the time very good but it's been pretty bad once or twice (I used to go here a lot...) 

You probably won't like it if you're from Philly. It's a way different sandwich. No whiz and it's a lot more dry (which is my preference)."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's makes decent enough subs for Pittsburgh, but the raving people do about the cheesesteaks is mostly out of inexperience.  Southside Steaks makes a FAR superior cheesesteak, but that doesn't mean you can't get other good sandwiches at Uncle Sam's.  Just don't try to make it something it's not, and you'll be fine here."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good but the meat to bread ratio was completely off! 

The golden ratio is only achieved by a few restaurants and Uncle Sam's just didn't have it right.  I ordered the Philadelphia Cheesesteak as an ode to my hometown and it was awful.  I should have never gotten a Philly Cheesesteak in Pittsburgh...The meat was okay but there wasn't enough, they were also really stingy with the cheese.

But what made the meal salvageable were the fries. The fries were perfectly crisp and cut thin (not a big fan of thick fries...)"}
{"text":"Decent place for a submarine sandwich. They will make it to order. Husband and I agreed that our respective subs (Philly cheese steak and veggie) were short on salt and pepper but otherwise tasty. There are tables to eat at, or you can get it to go. If you eat in, there's a basket with newspapers to borrow from. I expect we'll be back."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has been losing business ever since Burgatory (a burger joint based on the theme of hell .___.) opened right next door.  There were these little signs at each table which read, \"eat here again so that you won't starve... but more importantly, so that we won't starve!\" Oh dear.

Their cheesesteak is okay.  I thought the bread was mm a bit too thick compared to what was inside so it was hard to savor the flavor of everything.  I've had their cheese burger sub and mushroom steak sub and can't really tell the difference between the two except for the fact that the latter has bits of mushroom.

The portion is huge. I could only finish half of it.  The subs also come with fries."}
{"text":"I'd been sick for a few days and not up for cooking, so my boyfriend and I went in search of a cheap lunch.  Uncle Sam's, down the block, had been calling our name for weeks.  In need of big-time sustenance to help me fight the germs, I was ready for a meaty sandwich.

Inside, there was plenty of seating, and a few TVs showing the Penguins game.  The staff behind the counter was young and enthusiastic, chatting with each other and commenting on the hockey action.  We placed our orders at the far end of the counter - I got the Loaded Italian Sausage sub (comes with flavorful Italian sausage, grilled onions/peppers, and cheese).  I was confused when the girl taking my order asked if I wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Um....no.  That seems totally wrong on an Italian sausage and peppers sandwich.  My boyfriend got a Philly cheesesteak, and despite my badgering, he DID get it with tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo.  His philosophy is pretty much to get every available topping on a sandwich if it will make it more delicious.

We waited for about 10 minutes while a guy working a big grill surface browned up our meat.  It was fun to watch Taylor's cheesesteak turn from a gorgeous deep red to a delicious steaky brown.  I appreciate that they cook everything to order here, and they don't have piles of cooked meat waiting around to be thawed or microwaved or anything.  Our sandwiches were about $7 each I think, which was reasonable since the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the sandwiches were huge.

We took them home, and they were still warm when we unwrapped them.  They were both pretty good - I didn't exactly hear angels singing, but the meat was flavorful in each (and both sandwiches were definitely heavy on the meat!)  A regular size person with a normal appetite could easily get two meals out of one big sandwich.  I preferred my Italian sausage to the cheesesteak, since mine had more seasonings, the addition of grilled veggies, and no (totally boring and unnecessary lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  no!)  

I was thinking 3 1/2 stars, trying to determine whether to give them an edge up or down, when my boyfriend told me that the people behind the counter making the sandwiches weren't wearing gloves?  .....blargh.  I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but he assured me that he saw the grill-guy pick up our meat with bare hands and put it on the grill.  To be fair, there were some little pieces of wax paper partially enclosing the meat, but still.  And the girl who wrapped our sandwiches did not have gloves on either, he noticed.  Maybe they work really hard to avoid directly touching the food....but still, I'd say gloves are preferable.

I'm pretty much the opposite of a germophobe, so I don't really care that much, but I think 3 stars is fair for now.  I'm sure we'll be back to try another sandwich, and if it impresses me, I think 4 stars is in their future.  WAAAAAAAY better than a Jimmy John's/Subway type place, no contest there."}
{"text":"OVERALL: amazing fries (choose the dine-in option to get them for free) and good sandwiches. Service is slow and it's cash only, but there is an ATM in the store and a PNC nearby.

I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches, but this is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm a HUGE fan of their fries, which are delightfully crispy. I usually have to stop myself from finishing all the fries before I even get to my sandwich! They also give you an enormous amount of fries, which come fresh and hot. 

The sandwiches themselves are also good. I usually get some form of the Italian sandwich, which has flavorful meat and a good serving of vegetables inside them as well (lettuce, tomato, peppers, onions).

However, I do have two qualms about Uncle Sam's, which is that it's cash only and the service is pretty slow. I usually only carry my credit card with me when I go out, so when I crave sandwiches and don't have cash, I have to unfortunately go elsewhere. The service is also relatively slow - my boyfriend and I once waited 15 minutes for two sandwiches, when we were the only people in the restaurant besides one person who had already gotten their food. Despite this, I still love the place, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't know what to say. Good sandwich, but I had the runs the next day. Didn't eat anywhere else except home and ate food there that everyone else had and they didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Awesome fries and the rolls they use for the sandwiches are AMAZING!!  I am a vegetarian and always find yummy things to eat"}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's mixes two of my favorite things: America and giant hoagies. 

I've had the Italian and Buffalo Chicken and loved both of them. Best sub place in the area I've been to (Subway, Jimmy John's, Jersey Mike's). The fries are frozen, but all fries are good, so... Would be great if they were fresh cut, though. Aside from that and the 1920's payment options (cash only - really?), this place is awesome."}
{"text":"$10 for more food than you can possibly eat in one sitting. Good food and free water. What more could you ask for. 

*Always order for sit down so you get fries included."}
{"text":"Fries are AMAZING, and the steak and egg is pretty good.. a lot of food for the $$"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim, new to the area and had a taste for a sandwich. It was a great choice. Deliciousness and the staff were friendly and funny. Will definitely be coming back. Also make sure to carry cash they do not accept cards other than that they were great all around!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could give no stars...it was that bad! I used to eat here years ago when I worked at Montefiore. It's gone way down hill since then. It actually looks exactly the same just dirty and old.
The french fries were undercooked and hard and gross! The sandwich wasn't any better. You actually get charged a 99 cent fee for using your debit card. I've never been charged to use my debit card! Just a horrible experience all around. There were napkins and french fries strewn about on the tables and the floor yet 2 employees were outside smoking when I walked in. Perhaps their time would have been better spent sweeping the floor and wiping tables! Yuck! Will never return!"}
{"text":"From out of town and had heard about this place. 
Not impressed at all! 
Subs were okay. Price was alright. 
Workers are extremely rude!  Need better customer service skills. 
There are so many other choices in Pittsburgh, where the staff are friendly and welcoming. 
Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Just what I wanted... Great Italian Special Hoagie!  The cheese fries were awesome too!  So far the best hoagie I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a spot where I highly recommend experimenting. I used to order the mushroom and caramelized cheesesteak every time. Once I decided to order a regular cheesesteak which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. I forgot to specify that I didn't want mayo, but it turned out pretty good; so much so that a cheesesteak sandwich from Uncle Sam's is one of only two sandwiches in the world that I will accept mayo on.

The other tip that I can offer is not to pay with a debit or credit card. Basically, you are charged a transaction fee from Sam's in addition to any fees that your bank may charge you."}
{"text":"Still the best subs and fries.
Service is still good.
Recommend the chicken with mayo, lattice and tomato.
The steak with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato is also good but more filling."}
{"text":"This place is as good as everyone else on Yelp claims it to be.   I can't give it five stars because they give you free fries if you dine in but charge you for fries if you take out.   Nevertheless, awesome subs and I will continue going back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most excellent sub shops in the United States and I've tried other subs  in over 37 States and Sams is local primarily to the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"100% best cheesesteaks in Pittsburgh (note: not Philly!). Order with mushrooms and grilled onions.  Eat in for for fab fries."}
{"text":"This would be a five-star review but for their redonk cash only policy. This is, IMHO, the only good Philly cheesesteak in this town. 
Management - don't make me trod a quarter of a mile and through wet slippery grass to go to a bank. Either put an ATM in your store or wake up and realize it's 2017."}
{"text":"While the interior may be a bit off-putting to some, it's worth it for the food. The Oakland Uncle Sam's location makes the best cheesesteaks of all the locations. The steak just tastes better, cooked longer - most seasoned grill? I don't know, but it definitely tastes better here.

Each sub has the perfect ratio of filling to toppings, and can only be enhanced by adding lettuce, tomato, and onion. While the idea of the Ultimate variations of the cheesesteaks seems good, the ratios just don't taste as good. Our kids love going here for lunch whenever we're Oakland, and they can definitely handle eating half a sub on their own."}
{"text":"They don't take credit cards! What kind of place doesn't take credit cards????? 
 Whatever.....  Uncle Sams is almost an American staple...  I love it."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak is delicious. This is a fat kid treat, so don't come here looking for something healthy on the menu; just enjoy the cheesesteak with wiz and go to the gym later. Your body will forgive you."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Food is five stars. Service is 0. Called in an order, said it would be ready in 20-25min. Hour later still isn't ready. Also always need to double check the bag that they remember the fires and cheese sauce but they don't forget to charge you for them. So annoying."}
{"text":"Good Philly Cheese Steaks.

I can't hate on the quality of the subs... at all. You walk into a restaurant with cool decor, easy to read menu on the wall, order at the counter, and someone delivers your food. Cash only, which doesn't bother me... cash only is a great way to keep prices down (FYI that's the advantage for cash only joints).

I liked my Uncle Sam's Special and I really liked the thin cut fries. Maybe a little pricey, but the quality was good, so no complaints.

Since, it's an order at the counter joint... all the girl did was take our sub orders at the register, make change, then carry our subs 10 ft across the room, and plop them on the table. She wasn't very friendly either, may I add. You also clear your own table. They actually have a sign on each table telling you \"I'm not your mother, clean up after yourself\"... no joke. So what's with the tip jar? I think it's so chintzy to ask for tips in places like this. I hate that they put them right next to the cash register so you're obligated/pressured to drop something in with every employee watching you. Ugh...huge pet peeve of mine.

Overall, good place for a sub or Philly Cheese."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to go here for not only the food, but the workers too. Everyone is so friendly. The food is always great and now that they know my taste in foods, they will try to make me a sandwich to my liking without me actually ordering it. They have never failed me. 
The workers love their job, always laughing and they get along so well. It feels like a family atmosphere when I walk in. 
They don't take credit cards but they now have an ATM in their establishment. You used to have to walk to a bank for cash, but now everything is under the same roof. Can't go wrong with their food and their waffle fries (special order) are so good."}
{"text":"Best place for cheesesteaks anywhere! Their fries are just right, too. The only thing is that they have a bunch of annoying rules (no refills, only take cash, you don't get fries when you get a sandwich to go) but the quality of their sandwiches makes up for all the trouble."}
{"text":"uncle sams is so great. their fries are so delicious and the subs are just sooooo large! the bread and fries are really what makes these subs. you feel like shit afterwards though."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Uncle Sam's. Finally tried the sweet potato fries.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot for Chris and I. We call this our unofficial date night restaurant of choice. Whenever we go to the movies or grocery shopping somehow we make it to Uncle Sam's. The service is always fast and friendly and the food is great! I really cannot think of a better way to have a quick date than going to Uncle Sam's for a sub and a nice conversation. 

The subs come with a side of fries. These fries are great. They are slightly larger than shoestrings but are fried in peanut oil so they are crunchy to the max. The great thing about Uncle Sam's is that they have extra condiments or toppings for the fries (and possibly subs) around the restaurant. I like to sprinkle a bit of the Cajun seasoning on my fries. But then sometimes if I am feeling spunky I will get the malted vinegar and dip/sprinkle that over my fries. AND THEN if I am feeling really exciting I will add both the Cajun and the vinegar. They also have seasoning salt and spicy mustard that people can pick from; and of course Heinz ketchup. 

I always get the same thing each time I am there. Cheesesteak, extra tomatoes, extra onions, lettuce, mayo, and Italian dressing. I like a lot on my sub. Chris just gets the sub with nothing on it but mayo. He then adds ketchup later (gross). 

The nice thing is that these subs are so big that usually I only eat half the sub. This means that for about $8.00 I can have dinner and lunch the next morning. When you need your sub packed up you bring the basket to the counter and they wrap it expertly so there is no mess and everything stays within the sub. I hate it when you get a box for a sandwich. Everything will fly around in the box making it hard to eat the next day. This wrapping is the best. 

This time we were not that hungry and had a movie to get to so we split a sub. Because Chris didn't want any of my usual toppings they put all of my extras on the side in a little toppings boat so both of us could eat what we wanted and no one felt left out/lacking. I thought that this was great customer service. I really appreciated it. 

I suggest everyone go and try out their subs. You will not be disappointed. Also, try new things and tell me what your favorite other subs are! Maybe I will expand and try something new!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but whenever o babysit this one family their boys love to come here for dinner no matter what other suggestions are thrown out there they always shout that Uncle Sam's is their place to be. I mean don't get me wrong, I love it here too but I didn't realize that little kids like to eat here as well.

I will say that this location is a nice prime spot. Easy to get to, a parking lot down the street and icecream down the street. I can see why the boys love it here.

This location is also bigger than it first appears. You walk in to order and there are a few seats in the front then when you look past the soda fountain there are a ton of seats in the back. Really nice to not have to worry about where to sit.

Like most Uncle Sam's you order, get your number and they bring you out the sandwiches once they are finished. This is nice especially since, with two boys, you kinda want to keep an eye on them and not what at the counter for your food.

The sandwiches come with fries and they are crispy because they are fried in peanut oil (as a warning too). I usually get extra tomatoes and onions on mine. I also only eat half my sub on most days. How can you eat more with those fries! You then just bring your basket to the front and they will wrap up your sammy and put it in a nice bag for travel. 

I like coming here. It is fun and the food is good. Yummy! I say come if you need something fast and delish! Or even if you want to take your time and sit and chat. It's perfect."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and while the service was ok as I was eating my sandwich with my husband a MOUSE came from under the seat/bench. In all of my life I've never been to a restaurant and actually seen  a rodent while I was dinning.I  was completely speechless and under that same seat was a mouse trap. If I would have seen the trap prior to ordering my food I would have walked out. Inspectors should be sent there immediately. I'm surprised no one has gotten sick due to the possibility of contamination. I informed  the staff and they were very nonchalant and actually were talking amongst themselves about seeing rodents often in the restaurant.

If you decide to still eat there please be careful."}
{"text":"Never a disappoinment as long as I've been coming here. This is the place to go for steak subs in Pittsburgh. I put this place up against a Philly cheese steak any day of the week. 

Tender, juicy, fresh-never-frozen steak. Rich, melty, delicious cheese. Fresh from the garden tasting veggies. I could go on and on about the taste but I don't want to keep your stomach rumbling much longer. 

No frills place with great food run by excellent people. This is a hometown feeling place that just gives you a good feeling every time you think of it. They have multiple locations close to you so stop reading and get eating!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Their fries are excellent...thin, crisp and hot, and their submarines are alright, a bit on the dry side and basic for me personally (I like the meat in my pepper steak subs to be a bit more juicy and more cheese)."}
{"text":"This may still quite possibly the best place to have a cheesesteak...in Pennsylvania. Yes, we're in Pittsburgh here, not Philly. But these people get it right (no stinkin' cheez whiz!). The steak is cooked just right, the bread is delicious, and the fixins actually taste like something. Even more addictive than the sandwiches are the fries. I don't know what they do to them but they have that McDonalds-esque-nothing-really-special-here-but-actually-theyre-like-crack feeling. Really awesome.

The staff at both this location and the one down Forbes in Oakland are fast, efficient, and sometimes even funny.  But if you want a break from you college experience, go to this one up in Squirrel Hill. You'll see people from all walks of life, all ages, etc. 

Pittsburgh has a LOT of unhealthy, greasy, delicious options. This is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Consistently the rudest workers I have come across in this industry. They act like they are doing me a huge favor by serving me. The place is always filthy too. Never again."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Fox Chapel Plaza,  the service was quick!  I got the steak and cheese sub it was really good the fries were good too!  I couldn't consume the whole sub , so next time I'll get half a sub."}
{"text":"Yummy cheesesteak sandwiches with great bread."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh staple. Their cheesesteaks are fantastic, as are their fries (both potato and sweet potato). You order at the register and when your food is ready they bring it over to your table. The place itself is very low key and casual."}
{"text":"Great subs (the hot italian - get it), if you eat in, you get a boat load of fries, add some of that cajun seasoning, and you are good to go. Decently priced, quick lunch around the oakland area. I try to stop by once every few months when I have to be around oakland during lunch time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while out in Fox Chapel area for business.  Had an Ultra Mushroom Cheesesteak.  Tasted very good, but I was disappointed in how dirty this place is.  This place needs a deep clean.  There is dust all over the beer bottle display above the grill and I'm sure it falls in the food from time to time.  Also the cook was texting on his cell phone while cooking, and cell phones are some of the dirtiest things people own.  I frequent the Robinson location which seems much cleaner.  I won't go back here."}
{"text":"Uncle Sam's has really gone down hill. 
The staff has gone from polite, to indifferent, to borderline hostile. Simple requests are ignored - when the error is pointed out - they become indignant.  Turning to the food... the sandwiches are now 90% lettuce and served cold.  If the old adage about judging a kitchen by the state of the bathroom is to believed - stay away."}
{"text":"Eyed this place from the library across the street while I did some research and stopped by when the library kicked me out at closing time.  The good reviews on Yelp sold me.  

Wish I had just been a good girl and gone to the grocery store like I planned.  Decided to \"just get some fries\" from Uncle Sams.  Felt the rumbly tummy even while I was eating them.  Seriously?  From fries?

Not going back."}
{"text":"Looking at the yelp photos of the spongy, monotexture bread cheesesteaks , I should have known not to go, but the tantalizing descriptions of beef smothered in provolone made me walk up to forbes and murray to try Uncle Sam's. I've passed by this place a million times but never thought to go in.

The space is actually one of the coziest spaces on Forbes Ave filled with dispassionate teenage workers who are probably tired of eating cheesesteak for every meal.

The fries that came with the sandwich were chewy and dimensioned like Mcdonalds fries. It was only 30 minutes after the restaurant had opened but they were served lukewarm and had lost their crisp and heat.

The beef was the blandest and driest cheesesteak beef I've ever had. No smothering merge of cheese and beef (I cried a little inside). The Great Steak Escape at the mall can do better. It was segregated from everything else, lacking any flavor, juice, or caramelized onions. The mushrooms were canned, adding no flavor to the sub. The bread was awkward because you could tell once upon a time it was good bread, but had been left out and ungrilled :o  At one point I was just picking at the second half of my sub grazing the tough surface of bread and thinking what a nice faux-leather armchair it would make.

Good sandwiches and subs are made only two ways: by accident or through rigorous iteration. As Christine O'Donnell would put it, \"The proprieters of Uncle Sam's have lost their way. They are in need of some sandwichional repentance.\"

If I'm ever craving a juicy, texturized, flavorful sub again, I'll walk down Murray to Smallman's Deli for a beautiful corned beef reuben sandwich instead."}
{"text":"I've been going to uncle sam's in squirrel hill for the longest and never ever complained. This one just is not better than squirrel hill and Oakland locations. Stingy on fries and kids that work there are rude"}
{"text":"After a 4 hour ride to Pittsburgh, I made it to my first Pittsburgh eatery in anticipation for a greasy unhealthy sandwich. After lukewarm to poor reviews of Primanti Bros., we opted to go to Uncle Sam's for lunch. I ordered an Italian sandwich that came with fries for $6.90. The bread was soft and chewy and the cold cuts were glistening from the toaster oven. Mixed with some standard sandwich fixings and thin cut fries, a great first meal to start the Pittsburgh weekend."}
{"text":"Better than Subway, but not Jimmy Johns. And who doesn't accept debit or credit cards this day in age? I'll make my sandwich at home."}
{"text":"This is the best place I've been to in Pittsburgh for a cheese-steak or big sandwich. It's better than Primanti's, hands down. I have had buffalo chicken and cheese-steaks and both are delicious. The chicken is shaved like the beef is, which is a pretty cool approach. The steak is tender and all the toppings are delicious. The fries rock, although, I hear if you get take-out they don't include fries. So, I recommend eating there. The meat is good, the toppings rock, and the kicker is the bread. It might be the best bread I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Read other reviews and knocks about service.  If you ever go to Oakland location, the place has \"attitude\"...always did, always will.  That is part of the personality of it.  I personally like to skinny (pencil stick fries) and have to say one of my favorite sandwiches anywhere is their cheeseburger sub (LOVE IT).  If you are snobby and want your ass kissed...go to Burgatory next door where you will get an overpriced sandwich and some butt kissing.  If you want to man-up (or in my case Alien-Up), put on your big boy pants and get a real sandwich here!  I do agree with other reviews - place can be messy at times during a rush."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. My go to campus restaurant whenever I'm back in the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"Any business with the word \"sub\" in the title is going to scare me. Only because Subway has really ruined my idea of a sub. I hate Subway. Like, I can't even walk by a Subway and not shudder. So just by default I avoid anything with sub in the title. Sorry Uncle Sam's.

But Burgatory was closed for a watermain break and that was the only viable option. I'm really glad it was though, because it really was delicious. Honestly, it was very very good. I ordered the portobello sandwich, with melted swiss cheese and caramelized onions. It was funny because I asked for wheat bread (which Subway does have!!) and they said \"we only serve white.\" Well, okay. No avoiding the processed flour here friends!

But whatever, it was a darn good sandwich and I'm into it!"}
{"text":"No free refills on soda. The sandwiches are quite big, for the money. I always like eating here--I get the cheesesteak sub, which comes with French fries, but then I pretty reliably feel a little ill an hour later."}
{"text":"THE BEST Italian hoagies around. The fries are also pretty grand. I consistently come in, go for the Italian, eat half and eat all the fries. They wrap the second half for me and I eat it later for a late night snack or lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Cash only unless you want a surcharge on your debit card.

The Mushroom Cheesesteak was by far the best sandwich I have had here, albeit greasy. I've tried the Ultimate Philly Cheesesteak was like any other cheesesteak I have had. The Italian (hot sausage) was abhorrent, for the flavors just don't mesh well. Fries are poorly seasoned and soggy as well.

The bright side was that the amount of food you get for your buck was very generous."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.

I love everything about Uncle Sam's - the atmoshphere, the (loud) employees, the free fries when you dine-in and the cheesesteaks (naturally.)

My go to order is the chicken mushroom cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato. You won't be disappointed. The chicken is thinly sliced and has a nice char to it from the flat cooktop. To me, provolone is always the way to go on a cheesesteak. But hands down, its the bread that brings it all together. It's soft and chewy but sturdy enough to support all the other sandwich fillings. Yum!

A few things to note about coming here:
1) It can get insanely crowded. So be prepared to order as soon as you walk in, or stand off to the side if you're still making up your mind.
2) During the busiest times, there are two lines - one along the cooking line and the other along the side wall. Pick one and stay there.
3) Bring cash - it just makes life easier, trust me.
4) Come on an empty stomach - you're going to want to eat it all. But in the off chance you don't, they'll happily wrap up the remainder for you. Just bring your basket to the line.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  I got a regular cheese steak and my husband had an ultra philly cheesesteak.  Nice big subs for your money, cheese for dipping fries was good and everything that i couldn't finish was nicely and sanitarily packed up to go in front of my."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here. It's always super good and the portions are huge. Pictured here is specifically the hot Italian sub which is really good and their cheesesteaks are fantastic too. If you eat in, you get fries with it, so do that! Cash only, prices are definitely worth it in my opinion. I love it here!!"}
{"text":"Last weekend was my first time here, and I thought it was great! Even the vegetarian options are pretty unhealthy, but it is well worth it. Prices are low, especially since I took half my sandwich home with me. I don't eat food like this too often, but next time I am craving it, I will come here!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go, I get the same thing: Uncle Sam's Ultra Special. It's a steak and cheese with extra meat, mushrooms, grilled onions, and peppers. 

This place has great steak and cheese, and they'll make it right in front of you. It's worth the wait. The bread tastes great.

Their yam fries are good too."}
{"text":"One of the best damn subs in the city. Large and in charge, both a meat-o-licious medley and various veggie delights are available. Eating in is well worth the wait as the food is made to order...your patience is rewarded with complimentary, thin 'n crispy fries! Also, there's usually a hidden starlight mint somewhere in the basket should you bring your appetite. Good thing there's plenty to eat to distract you 'cause the ambience is less than noteworthy. If you're anything like me...when you hit up Uncle Sam's ya just gotta go big or go home (or to the ATM since it's cash only!). That said, go with an Ultra and don't look back now, ya hear?!"}
{"text":"It baffles me that more Pitt students did not frequent Uncle Sam's. It is a great alternative to the overcrowded, overrated Primanti Brothers, and was my Dad and brother's favorite place to eat when they would visit me on campus. This was partially because if you eat in french fries are free!!!!

Everything is yummy, but I recommend the steak and egg or a cheeseburger hoagie. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. If you are a fat kid at heart, like me, than order my personal favorite (creation) was getting the bacon cheeseburger hoagie and adding a fried egg - one stop hangover cure. 

Lastly, be prepared to nap after you eat here. IT IS A LOT OF FOOD!"}
{"text":"I like thisSquill location better cuz they have sweet potato fries. Still my 2nd fav cheesesteak place ever (1st place belongs to del amo steakhouse in torrance). it's really really good. with provolone and not the yellow slimy stuff. I really miss this place! Definitely tastes better when you eat it on the spot, but even to go is still great."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh, there are a ton of sub shops. This one however, is pretty good. They make pretty much all the \"normal\" subs with a couple of speciality subs too. The fries here are particularly good, especially the sweet potato fries. Service is pretty quick but if you go later at night, it tends to get pretty busy. Overall, can't go wrong here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Uncle SAMs is a great go-to lunch spot. I think all the sandwiches are delicious. I think it's the bread and warm meat combo that really makes its special. The fries come for free if you dine inside so I recommend to eat at the place. The seasoning for the fries are the bomb as well."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend with a friend.  While we originally had our hearts set on Burgatory (so good!) the wait was 1-1.5 hours.  We had plans and hungry stomachs, so she mentioned that Sam's is owned by the same company and is good.  Confirmed:  It is still cash only.  For $11, I got a 10 inch hot turkey breast sandwich, a ton of fries, and a large soda.  This portion is huge - really, I ate half the sandwich, a couple fries and was stuffed.  It was also really good!  I'm not sure why it's so hard to find a good turkey sub, but this place gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"In my opinion Uncle Sam's has one of the best cheesesteaks in the area.  I order it with extra meat, mayo, lettuce, hot peppers and their fries.  Their consistency over the years (since 1998 in Oakland) and consistency between locations is impressive.  I can always count on them the morning after to wake me up from a late night boozing coma."}
{"text":"It's pretty good food, but nothing spectacular. It's a lot of food for the value, and they throw in a good pile of fries if you dine in (it's like large size fries at McDonalds, not just a hand full). I haven't really noticed anything about the sanitary concerns that people sometimes bring up, but different standards for different people."}
