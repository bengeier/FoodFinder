{"text":"Been hearing Gerard harp about this place on the radio.  Forced to order a Large because of the pricing skew. Took quite a while despite place not being very busy (had just beat a rush apparently) though more on that later.  Place was clean as one would expect from the newness of it. Workers were chill, semi-pleasant. On to the food - steak was a bit tough / chewy and bread seemed a bit stale. Appeared to be about the same proportion size / quality as a Subway steak and cheese footlong. Just didn't hit the spot :-( Next time I'm craving a cheesesteak I'll have to go find famous Eddie's! So much better imho.   To the idiot, who ordered 2 min after me and clearly in a hurry - then runs off with my order - learn your fxckin name bruh! You weren't the only person in a hurry and waiting for food! I hope you're allergic to hot peppers.  Edit - Was surprised to see owner follow-up on my review. Showed genuine concern. Store had just opened on that Fri and was pretty slammed. Will give it another chance here shortly."}
{"text":"Food is amazing; staff is super friendly and open to any feedback. I live 30 minutes away, and it was well worth the drive. We will be making it again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just stopped for lunch.  We both had \"the original\" chicken with white American cheese.  This sandwich was amazing!   The hot and sweet peppers added a nice flavor.  I couldn't eat the whole thing so I wrapped up half for later.  We are only in town for a couple days but will probably stop by one more time before leaving."}
{"text":"A philly cheesesteak should have cheese on it. When I found that this was not the case, I gave the store a call and asked to speak to a manager. The owner picked up the phone. I voiced my complaints (not only was there no cheese on the sandwich, the other sandwich I ordered was simply just beef. None of the peppers or onions and mushrooms I was expecting.)   The owner Jeff claimed no sandwich has ever left their shop without cheese on it. NOT ONE SANDWICH! I insisted there was no cheese and he doubled down on his \"we put cheese on every sandwich\" claim. He would not falter on his cheesy throne. He said it was in the center and I wasn't \"looking hard enough because I'm from Ohio.\" Really the cook just forgot or swapped my sandwich. He offered to replace it and I politely decline his offer because I was just passing through Fairlawn. Update:  He did apologize to me after I posted this review.  I really wasn't looking for anything free, just an apology and maybe another person getting the right food.  Updated to 3 stars because even without the cheese, still better than subway I guess."}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying that I'm not from Philadelphia nor have I ever been there. So I don't know how \"legit\" this place is. This is purely based on taste and experience.  I'm not from the area but decided to try this place for dinner. As soon as I walked in I noticed a man helping several of his family members order. He has about 6 people with him and he was very excited to introduce them to this place as they had never been. He was raving about how much he loved it, so I was immediately excited.  Once they took my order I was impressed by how fresh everything was. He didn't put the chicken or beef on the grill until I ordered. All the veggies can't separate and were mixed in by the cook. None of that \"you can't have no mushrooms because they're already mixed in\" nonsense.  The bread was fresh, the meat was moist and delicious, and the flavor was awesome. Service was friendly and prompt. Shop was clean. I really liked that everything was cooked to order. Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is the lowdown. The cheesesteak tasted good. It was impossible to eat though - all the meat is shoved like on top of the large bun. Maybe that's the way they do it in Philly? Idk. The bun was too big to fit in my mouth so once I ate the meat part - I was left w just a ton of bun. Maybe I could have asked for the meat in the middle? This has to be a common complaint."}
{"text":"Everything here from the philly to the sides is amazing! It's like eating a cheesy philly steak sandwich straight from Philadelphia! I also had the loaded fries, and they used cheese whiz, my inner child was in Heaven to say the least! Can't wait to go back and try everything else ! I'm on a limited diet right now and they were more than happy to accommodate my needs! Will return!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new place to try cheese unfortunately I am still left with my original to spots as iwill never return to this place again even if it was free. service and greeting were as to be expected with no issues l. The cook on the other hand well it appears he wants everyone to know he is wearing grey underwear with a black trim. The food makes it even worse he put the raw ribeye on a smoking grill. Smoking? Why would a flat top smoke well that's all the food burning on the grill since he never cleaned it from last sub. He did a quick swipe with the spatula no the grill cleaner and my burnt nasty sandwich was ready in a jiffy. Gets better my sandwich was on the grill nearly done when a guest walks in and he cuts it in half adds more veggies and gives me half of what I was about to get. All with a smile .... oops sorry he didn't smile nor did the mgr. they got my last $10 for a burnt meat an Untoasted bun"}
{"text":"Just ate the best ever Philly steak sandwich here at the new opening. Delicious! Generous amount of juicy and tender steak cooked to perfection with a surprising and tasty touch of sweet and hot peppers. A real treat! Staff is super friendly and the place is clean with eye pleasing wall graphics. Must give it a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak itself was tasty. After living in Philly for years, i got my fix of cheesesteak here. HOWEVER, I ordered fries as the combo and they were like raw.  So when i tried to cover the taste with ketchup, I lost my appetite. I tried at least two different bottles with the same result. Even the label on the bottle was gross and can tell they have been used over and over... this was disgusting.....sad. I didnt even want to touch them amd then touch my sandwich"}
{"text":"So came looking for something different then normal fast food for lunch.  Stumbled across this little gem.  These are not the mall cheesesteaks these are real cheese steaks like they serve in philly.  I got the small ultimate with whiz and the  sandwich was amazingly good.   Everything was fresh and they genuinely care about your order.   After I finished they asked how it was and they want to hear your thoughts.   In this day and age of quick serve restaurants that seem to give little care about your experience this place is the opposite.   Expect good service , expect quality fresh ingredients and expect a caring staff."}
{"text":"Finally authentic cheesesteaks in Ohio! The portions are massive for the price and the sandwiches melt in your mouth. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until I delivered food while driving on a certain ride-share platform. Having lived in Philly for a few years, I've had cheesesteaks from all the big names and a bunch of others too. So naturally I had to try it out. Got mine \"wiz wit\" (that's cheese wiz with onions, a true authentic Philly steak). Admittedly, I was a little skeptical when he told me they stopped using Amaroso's buns. But the food spoke for itself. It was excellent. The bun maybe could have been a little chewy-er for my personal preference, but it was definitely fresh and very good. And since I don't have 8 hours to spare for the 500 mile drive, that's really just splitting hairs. 5 stars for an authentic Philly steak in NE Ohio? ... yeah, all day"}
{"text":"The best sandwich(of any kind) I have had in years. Fresh, hot, juicy. Well run. Husband said the fries a ted better than 5 guys, which he loves.  Finally I get to try a piece of Philly without going there!!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had. Fries were very good as well. Very friendly staff and very organized for opening a few days ago."}
{"text":"Total baller. The steak sub is on point. If you haven't stopped here you are crazy! Super good. Fries are great too. Everything is made fresh. We have been there twice this month."}
