{"text":"My partner and I love our Nespresso machine.  We recently purchased the \"U\" machine, after enjoying the use of the same machine whilst on holiday last month in Amsterdam.  
The speed and convenience of the machine is second to none!!! The quality of the coffee is exceptional.  
As we live outside of Toronto, the only way we can get our coffee it to order online.  
Hopefully there will be a boutique in London, Ontario some time very soon."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good Espresso machine and found that if not spending more than $700, the machine is not good.  Stumbled upon the Pixie Rouge works like magic for a cup of Espresso, though it is not using coffee bean but capsule.  But the quality has not been given up.  

As I know there are 2 stores, one at the Bay in downtown and the other in Yorkdale.  Only comes here to replenish the stock of the capsules.  Once in a while, the capsule flavours are phased out and new ones coming in.  When you purchase, you have to be a club member.  The staff are cool.  Some are experience and some are new.  If you ask to try out different flavor that you have not tasted before, sure you can sit at the bar and a cup of fresh brewed Espresso will be served in a porcelain cup to you like a restaurant.  You can add your own milk and sugar.   By the time you finish your Espresso, your order is ready and available for you to be picked up.  You can pay the stock while you are enjoying your Espresso.

Here usually lunch hour, there is a lineup of customers.  I try to beat the crowd at other time."}
{"text":"I received a reply from the Customer Service manager for my earlier review and I swear it seems like they took all of my comments and added them to their staff mission statement. Where before, the staff seemed cold and bored, they now seem human and far more friendly.
There was a rather large lineup when I arrived at lunch today and some customer lady at the cash was on the phone, taking to god knows who about god gives a shit what, and the sales associate was really nice. Sensing my impatience with this woman's utter void of manners, she apologized quietly and asked if she could get me a coffee from the bar while I waited. Why YES! I really wanted an espresso at that moment and it was as though she read my mind.When it was my turn to pay, my steamy and delicious Arpeggio arrived and I quietly sipped as I finished my transaction.
I'm so pleased to see how much warmer the staff seem in this store. it makes the often long waits seem less so and I genuinely enjoy coming in to get my pods. I'm happy to say that this store has brought service to an impeccable level and I hope they keep up the fantastic work!"}
{"text":"Since I used to work at 20 Queen this location was perfect for me. Take down the elevator, cross the walkway, down the Bay escalator and voil√†! Unfortunately the location is much less exciting than the rather boring description of how I used to get here... 

Anyway, so here's what I can say from the many visits in the past and today's visit. 

Location is convenient if you're downtown but the actual place is tucked in the lower level of the Bay. It's tiny, dark and tend to get VERY busy during lunch and at some points in the afternoon. This will inevitably cause line ups so don't expect a fast service. 

With that said and talking about service, most of the people working here is nice and has a decent knowledge of their products. Please note I say \"most\"  so your experience is likely to vary depending who's helping (or pretending to)  you. 

Since the opening of their main \"boutique\" on Cumberland you got to feel bad for this location. Yes, it's downtown, yes it has everything the other locations do, but it's simply too small and boring. Unless you work downtown, live close by or are simply passing by, there's no reason to stop by. 

Too bad Nespresso still charges a lot for shipping because despite the nicer look of the  Cumberland's location there's really not much reason to visit either store. But that's a story for another review and another time."}
{"text":"I love the Nespresso brand, the coffee and the stylish chic machines. I enjoy visiting their flagship store in Yorkville and hopping they would open another site in my area, the Distillery District. 

This is my go to location to pick up coffee pods. It's conveniently located downstairs from my office. My past experiences with the staff at this location are pretty good but today was AWFUL! This red hair, caucasian, female sales associate was rude and condescending. The best way to describe her is that she's rude b!tch. I left the store very annoyed and frustrated. Can retail stores really afford to keep employees like these when more and more consumers are shopping online? I'm never shopping at this location again."}
{"text":"Coffee is great especially the melozio. 

The sales staff at this location especially Elizabeth were totally rude and not helpful."}
{"text":"I love Nespresso coffee but my most recent customer service experience was not so good. The girl who served me 'Shayna' was not very friendly, did not seem to want to answer my questions and did not answer my questions about their VertuoLine very well. She did not smile once. The rest of the staff was also too busy chatting with each other to help customers.

My previous experience with their staff has been great, and at other locations, so maybe I'll stick to the other boutiques.

Also a previous reviewer, Christophe F., was right about those bags for recycling your empty pods, I made sure to ask for one :)"}
{"text":"The rating is an average between the quality of customer service (less than 1 star) and the overall aspect of the store (3-4 stars). 
This is not the nicest looking Nespresso sore in Toronto, but it does not look bad. It is quite well stocked but you have to \"beg\" if you want to sample a coffee. 
Maybe they are supposed to have a sampling station, but the employees decided it is too much work... 
The 3 employees in the store were busy when I entered. Two were with customers while the third one, \"S,\" was reading something upsetting on her computer. I believe it was upsetting as it caused her to smash the drawer shut. No greeting up to this point. After a few good minutes \"R\" offered to help me. The tone of whole conversation was unpleasant. I felt like apologizing all the time. Then \"S\" came to ring my order. Even worst. No eye contact, no word addressed to me. Maybe I wasn't dressed well enough... When I said that having a code bar on the receipt will ease her job she shut me off telling me: it is not that. I also got schooled a bit as it proved I didn't know what an exchange is. 
I feel bad to see so many capable, nice, polite, assertive people looking for a job while even being polite seems to be a challenge for the sales associates working for Nespresso. 
I love Nespresso, but I will order online next time, at least until they understand the importance of customer service in their stores."}
{"text":"I went to this location (pretty hard to find - located in the corner, on the lower floor at \"The Bay\") to look for some Christmas presents. I noticed that the store was not very busy, but three SA seemed to be either making a coffee for one customer (and ignoring others), another SA was showing some coffee pods to different customer (and also ignoring others). I actually had to stand there for almost 10 min, until one guy came up to me and asked what I wanted.
I told him about the travel mug that I saw in other stores and online, and he said \"We don't have it, maybe Yorkville location will have it\". He didn't check the back, didn't check the drawers, nothing. I think he wasn't even sure what I'm talking about.
Then I asked him few questions about some coffee cups, and he seemed very distracted, I had a feeling he is almost annoyed that I am asking so many questions. I pointed at two cups on the display and asked if these cups are coming with saucers (plates) and spoons. He said \"No, you have to get them separate\". I was pretty disappointed at that point but as I really came to purchase a gift, I didn't want to go to another location.
So I chose some coffee cups and while paying, I told another associate (it was a lady) that I feel sad that they do not carry the travel mug here. Right away she was asking me \"what kind of mug, how did it look like, let me check\" - all the right questions. She actually was able to go in the back and find the mug I was looking for! So I purchased that one, too.
Very disappointed in previous SA (guy with hundreds of Pandora bracelets) and happy about the service I received from this young woman.
Oh, and my surprise, when I learned that coffee cups did come with saucers and spoons! As in the picture on the box. This employee should really have some training in 2016.
Another thing I noticed when few customers, including myself, placed the bags on the counter and searched to find wallets, there was a big box right in front of my eyes. It was very annoying, placed right in front of my bag and my filled up Nespresso coffee cup. I asked the lady if she could take this box away because it was too big and the space is so limited. She looked up very confused and said \"I can't, it's for display\". It made me smile, really."}
{"text":"I actually considered downgrading them to a 2 star as a \"meh. I've experienced better\" because I really have.  I actually enjoyed buying my coffee in Ireland.  The staff were super enthusiastic, really friendly and chatty.  I was generally offered a coffee when I went in and sometimes scored some yummy biscuits.

I've bought countless sleeves of coffee from the boutique here.  For the first 6 months they were out of stock of the customer cards so I had to go through the laborious process of spelling out my name each time.  G, r, a...no, \"a\".  \"A\" for...am I the only one who can never think of a clean word when trying to spell things out?!?  Anyway, they eventually got some in which is a small mercy.  Staff are adequate to somewhat friendly.  I have been offered one cup of coffee here in the past 6 months.  None since.  The woman serving me the other day asked if I had tried a certain type of espresso.  I hadn't.  She didn't offer to let me.  I didn't buy it.  I've seen people drinking cups at the bar there so they must give them out.  Maybe you have to be aggressive and ask?  Maybe they don't like me?  

Nespresso as a brand has worked hard to create the illusion of exclusivity and a feeling of being in a special club.  At home in Ireland, this worked well.  It felt like a treat to buy.  Here, it's more like I'm being penalised for having bought the machine.  Still love the machine and the coffee though so I suppose I'll continue to drag myself in there or start paying for shipping!"}
{"text":"Must say after the fiascal... that Nespresso has stepped up to the plate and have been nothing but fantastic..."}
{"text":"Nespresso Boutique is hard to compare to any other Nespresso Boutiques because it is the only one in Ontario. They sell Nespresso machines ALL over the country and there are only two stores, one in Toronto and one in Montreal. Everyone else is forced to buy their expensive pod coffee online, for a shipping charge, of course. 

This store is very much a boutique, a bit too much formality when picking up some coffee. The staff are dressed in suits, each customer has a nespresso club card, you are called by name - it is all very la-di-dah. Do I feel like I am part of a club? Not usually. I generally feel that if there is this much pomp and ceremony around picking up some coffee, I am probably being colossally ripped off. But, I continue to enjoy my nespresso maker. 

If you are in the Bay at the Eaton Centre, it is a good idea to drop into the Nespresso store for a free sample espresso. Who doesn't love a free coffee?"}
