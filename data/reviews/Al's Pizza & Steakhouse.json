{"text":"This is my first time reviewing Al's but we have ordered from here 4-5 times now. The pizza has great sauce with a good amount of cheese and the crust has a great crunch. Our typical order is one Pepperoni bacon with cheese and one with out cheese. We have tried a couple others but this is our favourite order.   The staff are friendly and helpful.   The wings are okay but our last experience was very poor. We ordered 3 types of wings and used skip the dishes to deliver them. The presentation was poor and the sauce was everywhere on the outside of the containers. The hard part is figuring out if it was the resturant or the driver. The wings were cold and the flavours were not done well. The buffalo sauce was not mixed well and we had gobs of ranch that had to be scrapped off. The honey garlic were okay but a couple wings were way over done and looked unappetizing. The salt and pepper were the best of the three but were still cold and a few wings were not good same as the honey garlic.   I think it will be awhile before we order wings again but they still make a solid pizza and we plan to stick to pick up and stay away from delivery."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with a thicker crust in the area. Have only ordered pizza and picked it up so can't speak to in restaurant experience."}
{"text":"My Husband and I wanted to try somewhere new for our pizza night, so I checked out Al's Pizza online.  They had a family pack deal, you got a extra large 3 topping pizza, lasagna, caesar salad, garlic bread and 1 litre pop, for only $30!  It seemed like a really good deal for a lot of food.  It was only pick-up though.  There was a $4 charge if we wanted delivery.  So I ordered it and the girl told me it would be ready in 25 minutes, which on a friday at 5pm seemed really quick!  When I went to pick it up, I could tell the girls working were quite busy taking orders, even though the place itself was almost empty.  I noticed that it was very clean in the restaurant.  One girl got me to pay then ended up taking a order on the phone, so the other girl got my food for me.  As I was leaving to the car the second girl came out with my salad they had forgotten.  When I got home I realized that the pop wasn't in the bag!  So I called and whichever girl I was talking to apologized.  I asked that if they had a delivery guy in our neighborhood, maybe he could drop it off.  She said that was unlikely because they only have one delivery guy and they were very busy tonight.  She took my name and number and said she would make a note of it, so next time I could remind them and get it then.  Which I was fine with.  Our food was so good!  The pizza was full of toppings, not greasy at all and the crust was delicious!  The lasagna was hot and probably some of the best I have had in the city!  The salad and garlic bread was even super good!  Needless to say, we were stuffed with Al's Pizza goodness by the end.  Without a doubt, I would return to Al's pizza.  That family deal was a steal for the quality and quantity of the food you got!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Did a delivery order tonite through Skip The Dishes, guess they had an off day in the kitchen, it was just terrible!  Ordered a Beef & Onion with added green peppers on a thin crust.  Last time it was pretty good (not spectacular, but respectable), but tonite a total fail.   If I'd wanted a vegetarian pizza I'd have ordered it!  Way too much tomato paste, huge chunks of uncooked RED onions and green peppers that overpowered it, and no more than a scant tbsp of ground beef on the entire 14\" pie.   Only on 3 thin slices could we detect even a tiny dollop of beef, up at the crust. And it arrived cold.  If Als is going to skimp on the main ingredient (beef), we'll be skimping on ordering again in future from this place.    Editing to add, that after a phone call to speak to the manager at Al's:  Manager states they were short-staffed in the kitchen tonight, (sorry, not a great excuse but....) and apologized.  Will see if it improves on a future order, for which he has arranged a credit.  We'll see if that is still honored after we return home in 2 months!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from Al's for years. It is consistently good and it is my go to pizza place. The sauce and crust is worth me driving to pick it up even though it is no longer close to where I live"}
{"text":"My friend and I order from Al's every Sunday.  We would eat in the restaurant (Sundays are half price pizzas)  but we have movie night at my place.  The pizza is consistently outstanding.  We both love the sauce and the crust is fantastic as well.  Our go to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Al's for lunchtime drop-in using my smartphone app, and was very happy with my pasta lunch! So the wife and I later decided to order pizza from here for a special event: a gaggle of kids and a group of adults. Although delivery was a tad long (thanks to Skip the Dishes--see below), the food was excellent: Kids ate up their pizza with gusto, and adults were happy too!  So next I took my whole family to the restaurant for dinner one evening. Food was just okay: My baked ravioli was watery/greasy and kind of bland, the wife's chicken rubbery. But my kids practically inhaled their chicken strips and pizza, so we left fairly satisfied. (The servers were friendly when they could be, but busy and slightly overwhelmed--maybe an extra employee would have helped? I dunno...)  Act three came with a delivery ... but they only included 3/5ths of my order! And wanted to give me a store credit when I pointed it out on the phone! But I wanted my chicken donair and pop. So they made a special delivery, which arrived quickly, even as my kids were still working on their dinner. So I got to eat my donair alongside my kids' eating their meal after all. This really made a difference. Anyone can make a mistake (and everyone does), but these folks owned their oversight and made an effort to make our experience a good one--and succeeded.  And the food ... it was very good this time. Pasta was good, salad was excellent. Even something as simple as cheese toast was gobbled up by our young ones. The donair didn't last long, it was so tasty!  So this truly is a neighborhood establishment that is invested in serving their local customers and community, and being fair and open to their clientele. They get my recommendation.  PS: Not a criticism of Al's: They use _Skip the Dishes_ to deliver, and I'd say this is their Achilles' heel: StD doesn't seem to me to be the most efficient way to get food delivered, and StD's web-based GPS tracking system is a physics-defying knee-slapping hoot sometimes."}
{"text":"Ordered here quite a few times. Whether for delivery or pick-up. I have never eaten in the restaurant, so I can't comment on the service. It does look like your typical old school restaurant with dated decor, however I find they all look like that.   The pizza is what I like to call old school pizza and personally my favorite. The crust is thick and they don't skimp on toppings or sauce. I always have the vegetarian pizza and it is delicious.   There baked pasta is my favorite items they carry. I have had the lasagne as well as the baked spaghetti and they are amazing. Perfect comfort food and tastes like you Italian food you would order in an old school Italian restaurant. Very authentic sauce and a hearty meal.YUM!  The prices are economical, service is good and the food I have tasted so far has been great. They offer delivery as well as pick-up and the employees are always so friendly.  Will continue ordering from them when I have that craving for pizza or baked pasta! Great NW gem!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas were good. But the waiter on Sunday was kinda grumpy, no patient, no smile, and no greeting at all. Even they have 50% off pizza on Sunday, we were the only customer there. Probably their customer service was driving ppl away."}
{"text":"Years ago this he's been one of my favorite pizza joint now seems like they don't care  Not sure if it's under new management Seems like they don't care  PIZZA is a mess and flavorable"}
{"text":"After a delayed flight home from vacation Derek and I were too tired to cook, didn't want to go out because our two cats were too starved for attention after 2 weeks away, and we didn't feel like going back outside anyway.  Delivery came up, and normally we'd order from another place but they didn't have what either of us was craving so I remembered a coworker mentioning Al's so I brought up the website and started going through the menu.  It had what we wanted, but strangely no olives so I called up the restaurant to ask about that.  Turns out we'd been looking at the wrong site.  The lady on the phone was super awesome - she was personable, professional, and very patient with us while I went through the correct site's menu with her to make sure we were ordering the right items.  From her personality on the phone I would order from them again, that type of phone-order customer service is hard to come by.  She took our order over the phone and said it would be 45 minutes for delivery.  The driver arrived within the specified timeframe which was also good and the aroma of the pizza from the kitchen when Derek opened the door was amazing.  I had the Greek pizza which had beef, red onion, olives, feta, tomato, green pepper, and a can of coke.  It was so delicious I ate half the 12\" medium without hesitation.  It was absolutely delicious.  The crust was perfectly cooked, the toppings were fresh and well seasoned, and the sauce was just the right amount.  The cheese was so well melted that even after being delivered it was just the right amount of gooey.  Derek had a pizza that involved anchovies so I didn't try it but he said it was really good, he just needs to remember to order extra anchovies next time.  I'm happy for him for finding a place that even serves that, but I'm definitely not sharing! Like mushrooms, he's welcome to all the anchovies he wants as long as I don't have to eat them.  We will definitely be ordering from Al's again!"}
{"text":"We attended Al's this past Friday night for dinner. When we walked in we were told to pick a table and sit down. We did and waited a couple of minutes for our drink order to be taken. We got our drinks and ordered our food (after my asking the waitress if she liked a certain pizza and was told yes she did, I ordered it). Food came in a reasonable amount of time. I had the donair pizza and my Mother had fish and chips. My pizza had zero taste or flavor except for olive oil that must have been doused on the crust. The look on my Mother's face told me her fish and chips were not to her liking.  I asked her and she said that the fish was tasteless.  Not wanting to make a scene, we waited for the left overs to be packed up. We asked and then waited about 10-15 minutes for the carry out boxes to be brought to us.  The waitresses were both busy answering the telephones that continuously rang, obviously for take out or delivery all while trying to fill drink orders.This affected dine in customers quality of service. There was a younger girl also behind the counter who didn't appear to be doing anything but getting in the way of the other two who were trying to do multiple things.  We went to the counter only to be told their printer wasn't working so we couldn't get our bill. We payed just to leave.  The were a couple other things that weren't right, the restaurant is not that clean (dust, dirt and gross carpet) and one of the waitresses was wearing a sleeveless tank top. I really don't care to have armpits in my site line.   This place is poorly managed, unprofessional and has tasteless food- avoid it !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I've found its either a hit or a miss kind of restaurant. There chicken wings are tiny and dry. Pizza is ok but this time was overly cooked and was kind of burned at the bottom. I had asked for easy in the sauce and it was drenched with sauce. There Fettuccine is pretty good and huge portion. I've ordered there chicken strips 3 times.. The first 2 times was decent and good and last time i ordered was a whole different kind of chicken strips.. Very tiny and you can find them at wal mart or superstore which ive bought.. Anyways I think I wont be taking anymore chances from restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Our new local pizza place, deep dough spicy sauce. Ordered when the b in law was over on sat night. The toppings we wanted were unavailable in a pre made pizza, and the two topping pizza was on special.  The person on the phone insisted we order a two topping for pickup. When we tried to add an additional topping or two they said four fifty for every additional topping.  I don't think it is possible to fit almost five bucks worth of banana peppers onto a pizza. Also, that goes against my inclination to not be ripped off and bullied. From a taste pov it Did the trick, but sadly not a local gem. All three of us had bad tummies for days after. Spicy sauce?"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time ordering from Al's and we loved It even more than the first! You have got to try the all meat pizza with added feta. Amazing!!! You can just tell the sauce is loaded with fresh tomatoes and herbs. They are generous with toppings and cheese. The crust is semi deep dish that's crispy on the outside yet still soft on the inside. It's a perfect ratio of crust toppings and sauce. Definitely one of our favorite pizza delivery options."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new pizza place, and had heard good things about Al's so gave it a shot. Their website for delivery orders is setup through skipthedishes. We decided to get the house special and the 'Al's special' wings. In the requests box we asked for the onions to be swapped out with pineapple (no, you're wrong - lightly toasted pineapple is amazing) and hoped for the best. The pizza came with the change made as requested.  I'll start with the wings as there is less to say. In shot, pretty standard. We couldn't figure out what the Al's Special flavour was. Best guess was something like a taco/chili seasoning. The wings were average size and nothing special, although not bad. Probably would pass next time.  The pizza on the other hand was much better. We got the House Special Pizza. The toppings are generous and the crust is pretty good. It was a bit soggy near the center, but given the amount of toppings it's not entirely surprising. The flavours meshed really well and it was overall quite tasty. The only thing that wasn't super great was the sauce. Good amount of sauce, but it tastes like a bottle of spaghetti sauce you'd buy at the store. We heated up left overs the next in a frying pan and they were great.   In summary, not the best dining experience ever, but for a grant total of around $25 for a medium pizza and wings, we really can't complain too much. The pizza is a solid 'good'. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have ordered from Al's again and have been pleased with the quality of the pizzas I have eaten. I have not ordered the donair again. If and when I do I'll post an update."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times as it's local to family's house.   It's well decorated, not gawdy or trashy looking and it's pretty clean. I recommend the pizza or the pasta as that is their specialty.  My husband had the ribs and they were just ok, dry and not super flavorful.  Their baked lasagne and spaghetti are really good and they serve huge portions!!  I had the smoked salmon fusilli which was really yummy and had a great flavor and good creaminess.  The garlic bread is nothing special, toast with garlic butter and the Caesar salad is pretty good but again nothing special.   I'd recommend this place as a good family eatery for their pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"Have ordered from Al's in the past and it was always decent (not great, not awful)  but this last time it was actually inedible.  The two pizzas were bland and even with ordering/paying for extra they were very very skimpy with the toppings.  The one pasta dish was also bland and very greasy"}
{"text":"You have one. I have one. And the fortunate people in the NW of Calgary have this one. A true neighbourhood resto that's been owned and operated for years and untouched by the chain restaurants.   The type that serves homestyle food at a good price and decent taste, with little pretentions and bells and whistles.  No laughing clown or talking mexican dog as a mascot is seen anywhere. Places that you would consider to be a greasy spoon, yet still be good.  Al's is definately one of those places.  It's a nice pleasant little resto hidden in the NW, complete with the menu of burgers, fries, pizza and pasta.  But what differenciates this one from most of the others, with probably the only exception of Bella Roma near North Glenmore Park, is that it makes it's own pizza dough.  Honestly, this pizza dough is honestly one of the best I've ever had west of the legendary New York Pizza.  The toppings are fresh as expected, and the sauce, I believe is possibly home made as well as it didn't have that generic flavour, as it had a bit of a bite, yet still didn't overwhelm the ingrediants.  Either way, I still mentally rave about the pizza dough in my head even now, as it was simply that good.  Best of all, the resto has a pretty reasonably priced take out special for small to X-Large take out pizzas with 3 toppings of your choice.  I only wish I was closer most days to take advantage.  Just a friendly word, the lunch service tends to serve only the basics, pizza and burgers and none of the rest.  My guess is that they have a professional cook for the dinner service only.  Still, as you've read by now, it's simply awesome pizza and well worth having if you're in the area.  Review #4 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Decided to try Al's Pizza.  A friend told me that it was pretty good.  We picked up a 14\" Al's Special Pizza and it was all right, a little bland for me.  I wish the sauce was a little spicier.  Also tried the Greek Salad and that was pretty good.  You get quite a lot for the Greek Salad for One."}
{"text":"Very old interior...hasn't been renovated in at least 20 years?  BUT...the food is really good!  Old school pizza menu with all the basics...but they do them really well.  Great crust!  We also had the four cheese fettuccine - very good!  Nothing fancy here, but they have some fantastic comfort food."}
