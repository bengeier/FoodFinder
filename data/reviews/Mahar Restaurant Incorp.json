{"text":"Reasonably good Indian style Punjabi food. All day buffet is their key.  All buffet dishes (good variety) taste very good. Butter Nan is also served.  Thought this is one of the best Punjabi style food place in Gerrard St E. Lunch buffet costs below $10 and Dinner buffet $12.99. Arguably, value for your bucks in the st.   Only issue is the place is small, and sometimes too many people waiting for their turns..."}
{"text":"I've been to the dozens if not hundreds of Indian restuarants in Toronto mentioned in David M.'s review, and this place is right in the middle of them.  You can easily do better.  I went here for the dinner buffet.  The three things this place has going for it: 1) burfi on the buffet - a rarity in my experience, 2) the server brought a couple fresh nans to our table (at my request) and 3) they had pakora curry on the buffet, which is nice to see even if it wasn't all that well-made."}
{"text":"I love Mahar, the food tastes great, the service is excellent (although I always seem to go when it's quiet), and  they bring you fresh naan to your table."}
{"text":"First-timer Mahar goer, and it was a good experience.  This is a smaller place, as far as little India goes, maybe 12 tables tops.  As for the food, it's the standard Little India fare buffet, with a slight twist.  What I found good about Mahar was: (1) While there was less selection from the buffet, they all tasted really fresh, and (2) They seem to have a few different desserts, as they also operate a bakery.  For instance, for dessert, I have a pretzel looking \"thing\" (I'm so culturally ignorant) deep fried in honey.  Delish....    I worked out in the last 24 hours, so this, along with the 12 of donuts were well deserved rewards...  Decor is good;  glass covered tables, clean, well lit.  I'm no Indian food cook, but honestly, I find many places do a lousy job with Paneer, and this wasn't the case with Mahar.  Likewise the Naan, and Samosas are amazing, if not the best on the Little India strip.  I would recommend this place to anyone seeking quality over quantity, who doesn't mind a more intimate setting."}
{"text":"This has been our preferred restaurant on the strip in the past year.  My wife's a vegetarian and can't always tolerate indian food, but we live nearby and this place has always worked out for us.    It's not the biggest restaurant on the strip, but they have a good buffet, good menu.  The food always seems fresh, hot and better prepared than many of the alternatives on the strip.  It doesn't really stand out as being superior in a clearly identifiable way, but it's definitely a good choice in the area, and we'll definitely eat there again.  Their desert selection is pretty solid, and it's a fine place to pick up some indian sweets to take home with you as well.  As Harold E. implies, they do often have jalebi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalebi) in addition to gulab jamun (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulab_jamun) and often a couple others as part of the buffet.  We often bring my son, and they were once kind enough to offer him a few of the not-on-the-buffet sweets to see if he'd like them.  (He didn't try, but it was a nice gesture)."}
{"text":"For a PART-TIME veggie like myself, I was expecting to be limited at the buffet dinner and end up making it a 'meat' day but there was just as many if not more veggie options as there were meat ones, and they were all delish!   Not too crowded, small but not tiny, friendly waiter, this place was a nice restaurant to go to with a couple of people who can't decide on which desi dish is their favourite (or whether they are vegetarian or carnivore).   As with all the others, they offer you the option of lassi, masala chai, etc AND the desert in the buffet includes jalaybe which I haven't seen in many other buffets. There is also other, more standard dessert option of course, such as golab jamun and pani puri.   No ice cream, though."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I've visited on Gerrard Street. The buffet has a lot of variety and the food is pretty good, but it's surrounded by a dozen or so other Indian restaurants, and I can't usefully distinguish this one from any of the rest of them."}
{"text":"An excellent smaller buffet, with very friendly service. The food is delicious and very well-priced, too! Try the sweets - they are made by the owner himself."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time in 3 years in Canada that someone has sold me stale food.  I went to mahar with lot of expectations as it is considered to be one of the oldest establishments in the area ESP looking for their sweets. I ordered the popular ras malai and barfi. I still can't believe it , but all of them turned out to be stale. This won't even work in India with its lax standards. I am thinking of complaining to the food inspectors"}
