{"text":"If you want some different pizza taste wise than what you can commonly get, then order a pizza to test it out. By no means is this the best pizza in the area however."}
{"text":"I thought this pizza was great! Thin, crispy crust and a good amount of toppings. Lots of cheese was a plus. I got a 12\" cheese, mushroom, and green bell pepper. The toppings were fresh and delicious--will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"OK When you're hungry and need something quick & close.  I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"I was worried after reading some of the reviews, so I avoided this place until a groupon appeared. I am in love with this pizza! So nice to have something different. I loved the cookie they have also. To die for! Bought more Groupons and told my friends to buy them also."}
{"text":"Superb! Very fresh ingredients and the taste of the sauce and cheese blend is incredible. I love mine with fresh basil, onion, garlic, pepperoni and green peppers! Yummy! For those who are complaining about the price, the bottom line is this...................YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! If you want processed, frozen ingredients that were probably shipped in from another country, pre-made, frozen dough, and sauce from a can, then you should definitely NOT order from Mr. Scrib's. However, if you want fresh ingredients, fresh dough, homemade sauce and a delicious pizza that you will not soon forget and constantly crave until you get the next pie, then Mr. Scrib's is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Pizza is OK, I think they need to cook them longer. My main issue is $15 for a cheese pizza and $19 for a deluxe. I can get equivalent pizza from the grocery store for much cheaper."}
{"text":"This pizza was far from the best.   It was cooked  well and the toppings were \" ok\". The dough had no taste.    Not worth 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Just tried this new pizza place near my home.  Pizza was delish!  Thin crust, but with a soft crust, not a crackery-type one.  I believe they use multiple kinds of cheese.....man it was good.  I had to take one star away because of the price.  $16.00 for a large cheese pizza.  I think they need to re-evaluate the pricing situation or this place will not make it,  particularly when you have two Barros pizza stores a few miles away, where an XL cheese is like $11.25.....I might be back, if I get a coupon or something."}
{"text":"I think Mr. Scrib's is great! Super thin crust, perfect amount of toppings, and a good tasting sauce. I do agree that pricing is a little higher than competitors, but it is well worth it. I can also always find coupons laying around from various mailers. $12 (including tax) for a 16in 3-topping pie isn't bad at all! The only thing I wish they offered was delivery,  but that's just a minor gripe. I also really like the way their pizzas are cut - in squares!"}
{"text":"We are from Muskegon Michigan and were so excited to hear the Scrib's was going to be in the valley. It is a must have anytime that we go back to MI.  We drove 45 minutes from the east valley to pick up our pizza.  When we got there the staff was super friendly and talked with us quite a bit about the new stores and plans for the Valley.  My boyfriend could not wait to dive into the pizza and started eating it right in the car..  It was just as delicious as the Scrib's that we love back home.  His only complaint was that we did not order an extra one for later.  We can not wait for the Apache store to open but until then we will definately be making the drive to get more!!! Yeah Scrib's"}
