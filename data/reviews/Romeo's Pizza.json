{"text":"The pizza is good, the rewards program is a joke. We have been buying pizza here for years and they have not tracked our purchases; so we have earned nothing.  To add insult to injury, they forgot to put my latest order in the oven so when I arrived they had not even started."}
{"text":"In my top go to pizza shops in the area. Always easy to order with, timely delivery, drivers are very nice, and most importantly the pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"We Used a coupon deal they had. They only gave us one garlic breadstick,which was just half of a hoagie bun and no marinate with it. The garlic white sauce was nonexistent on the pizza. The picture showed lots of tomatoes and broccoli on the pizza but each slice had one sliver of tomato and only broccoli stems. Won't eat here again"}
{"text":"All I can say is that I have had some good pizza and I am extremely picky about my pizza let me tell you. They have to have sauce lots of sauce and it has to be good!! They have you covered on both counts good sauce and plenty of it. They have a specialty pizza the Italian and it is basically a Chicago pizza and it is by far my favorite.   Pizza is always good here and I have no complaints on anything else I have ordered like wings, salads etc. Good value and great taste can't miss here."}
{"text":"This location is awful. I've ordered from here three times and each time the meat on my sub was so burnt that it was black! I did get a refund for one of the sandwiches without incident. The only thing they can make without messing it up is a salad. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"the pizza has been great every time we come back to Cleveland...but this was the worst experience we have ever had. It took nearly two hours for the food to get to us when we we told it would be an hour. we called at an hour and fifteen minutes and were told they only had one driver on a Saturday night and he would get there before midnight. The food was ordered at 10:38p. The driver need up showing near 12:30a.  This may be the last time we order from here. I don't care that you only have one driver on a Saturday night. When you give a delivery, an hour after the promised time is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Romeo's is on the level of Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. If you want gourmet pizza, go down the road to Antonio's. If you're looking for cheap pizza that is also delicious, look no further.   The sauce is a bit unique, so it won't fit everyone's taste.  Highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and incredibly polite staff. Try their great ranch potato, it's definitely my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Who dumped the sugar bowl into the sauce pot?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 /12 hrs early and had set time for delivery and it was 15min late. The pizza was OK but if you spend $25.00 for one pizza it should be alot better. Not much on toppings and hardly anything around the crust. Was disappointed."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton at the airport and couldn't muster the will to leave again, so we ordered delivery from Romeos.  It arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule (in 40 minutes, not bad) and we tucked in.  When I am out trying pizza, I normally stick will plain pepperoni or pep and mush.  On this trip, I had my mom with me so we went for the traditional crust (not too thin, not too thick) with 1/2 pep & mush and 1/2 grn pep, onion and mush.  The pizza was very lovely.  Nice and brown.  Upon picking up a slice, I smelled...something...smoke?  Now I don't know what this is coming from.  Is the pepperoni smoked?  I don't know.  And I think that is what got the 3 star review from me.  I am not a fan of smoked meats or whatnot. I feel like that smell/flavor is phony.  I would also say that they are a shade stingy on the cheese.  If I had to do it again I would get a cheese pizza with extra cheese.  Moms side with the veggies was good, she said.  It is often a problem with getting the veggies done, and she said they could have been a little more cooked. The breadsticks were ok, but we ordered with cheese and we couldn't tell if the cheese was on there, maybe another instance of the stingy cheese disease. BOIL IT DOWN: it was ok for whatever we could get delivered to the hotel...not bad.  Sweet sauce, good crust, GET EXTRA CHEESE."}
{"text":"Dominic Santos wouldn't answer the phone. Too tired to drive to Angelo's. Romeo's is stingy with the cheese, sauce and the toppings. Pizza tastes like Georgio's at three times the price. No seating carry out/delivery only."}
{"text":"I was just passing through and one of my clients recommended Romeo's Pizza.   I enjoyed my fresh veggie calzone and Romeo's twist on the campfire dessert in S'mores. Corey was spot on with his recommendations.   Though I do not eat out often, it was cool to get out and see what the town (Brook Park) on the outskirts of Cleveland had to offer.   Thanks."}
{"text":"BEST QUALITY and SERVICE!! Have had several different pizzas here, all good. Had friends for comparison pizza party- they like Antonio's, Marcos and Geppetos All ordered other nites. One of Romeos managers,JERED took my order. VERY PROMPT delivery man, so nice and PIZZA came w/ paper plates and napkins! PIZZA was PERFECT- Sean's favorite on menu w/ pepperoni. DELICIOUS!!! Friends agree, ROMEOS PIZZA IS BEST!!! Thanks JERED and STAFF- ROMEOS ROCKS!!! They are not too pricey and quality of food is great!"}
{"text":"I love their wings. The food is always hot when delivered and they're always on time. The only issue I had with them is that the ranch pouch they gave me was spoiled. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"It was a cool night, after dealing with what I can only dead urge as the definition of people that don't deserve welfare (essentially 85% of Lorain county) I thought my only haven would be my church equivalent, a pizza shop. I was \"greeted\" with a nod from a blank stare, cold eyed girl. The kind of girl that thinks she's a 10 but honestly is only 7 because she uses one third of all of her make up every morning. \"What can I get you?...\" I try to be chirpy, hoping that this blonde silhouette of a human being had a any sort of empathy or ability to emulate positive emotion. Alas I was mistaken and was given a sullen response to my simple white pizza with yellow peppers. I may as well have been in Azkaband as the other employees sucked the energy from my corpse like a de mentor. I was told to come back in 15 minutes so naturally and in order to preserved punctuality, I set a timer. I returned in 16 minutes hoping the extra minute would give them time to find personality, I was mistaken again. I was handed my pizza swiftly, as if I was about to get a fatal drug. The pizza felt lukewarm at best,just like the girls personality on the happiest day of her life. If you're looking to feel like you're part of the Anime club at high school while trying to talk to a cheerleader, this could be a fun experience."}
{"text":"I called tonight and made an order for delivery.  I had to give them my credit card three times before they got it right.  They quoted me 45 minutes.  An hour later I called to see where our order was.  I was told - he just left. Sorry there are a lot of new people here.  When we got our order it had been an hour and half since I put our order it.  Our side sauce was wrong and the BBQ sauce had spilled all over the chicken fingers.  The pizza was good but not warm an unfortunately the experience was to disappointing for us to order there again."}
{"text":"Romeos is my favorite pizza chain around! The sauce has this sweet tinge to it and it just delicious."}
{"text":"We had just ordered a pizza at the new mentor on the lake location, first time eating Romeo's pizza.   Wow really good. They are right about the secret being in the sauce the sauce is excellent very sweet just like we like it.  And that thin crust with the dipping sauce very good.  For sure the best pizza in this area. Will be back."}
{"text":"I'm new to Twinsburg and wanted to order in pizza, so I thought I would try Romeo's. My estimated delivery time was 50 minutes. Fast forward to an hour and a half later and the pizza still wasn't here. By the time it arrived, my entire order was cold. Pizza wasn't even warm. The jojo's were soggy, like old fries that had been sitting around. I can't even say how good the food is because it was all cold. I would probably try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I got a small pizza with red potatoes and caramelized onions, it was seriously perfection!! :) loved it, will be ordering again definitely."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place... in Medina!  And that's the reason for 4 stars and not 5.  For Medina, this is the best pizza, but coming from the East Coast and the pizza there, I couldn't rate this 5 stars.  The pizza sauce is on the sweet side and is very delicious.  We typically order via phone, and the order is ready in 15/20 mins.  The staff is friendly and ready to help as soon as you walk in.  Utilized the delivery service a few times, always on time and the pizza still hot.  UPDATE:  I've knocked them down to 3 stars, as it seems every other time I order, they get it incorrect."}
{"text":"Romeo's is just down the hill from my daughter's house. Even if they were further away, we would still call Romeo's \"our\" pizza place in Twinsburg. Try The Great Ranch and Potato Pizza for an amazing twist to non-tomato pies."}
{"text":"Hey I am in town from Chicago, so I know pizza!  Let me tell you Romeo's is excellent!  Good sauce, great sausage.  I had the deep dish.....better than most in Chicago!!!"}
{"text":"Romeo's food always arrives fresh, love it for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Again based on sauce, crust and a simple pepperoni pizza.  Romeos is a sweet sauce with the option to have a spicy sauce. Today I had the tradional sweet sauce. This is one of the better sweet sauces I have had .The crust is near perfect with the greaseness of the pizza at a low level  Full bar available. Good wait staff. medium noise level"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town by far. Boneless wings are great and the pizza is amazing. Service is always very nice and the food comes on time. Menu is massive and everything on it has impressed me"}
{"text":"Had a cheese pizza and some Jo Jo's and just from these two items alone, I'll be back. The pizza was great. Loved the tomato sauce and the crust, both tasted homemade. Potato wedges were a great accompaniment."}
{"text":"So good! amazing service and I love the pizza and wings! they get so busy and i still get my food so fast and perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"Great place but we had a large order today and they messed it all up now we have to wait for them to remake it. That's the first time they messed up but of course only when we have people over."}
{"text":"ELYRIANS....This is your commander...lol...a lil humor folks...anyhow... I am Italian, and as such I will give a true review...plus..I am fat, so I am a professional!..well..the PIZZA wow, awesome..seriously none better..i hate ordering from franchises but this was close, anyhow...the Crust, 2nd to none...not under or over cooked..the correct amount of sauce and cheese... well, we had that..then some folks came over and they ordered also, so we had a good understanding of there food...OUTSTANDING....SUPERB.... my only problem were the owners the Gal seemed...well...scarry and i felt bad for the husband, as he was very meek and kind and she was business and one of a kind!.... you could tell who wore the pants in the family.... from what I was told...She is a ufc fighter and should beat Rhonda for the title in 2 seconds flat..I watched her bodyslam her hubby...anyhow..all is outstanding, the food, the owners, the employees,,outstanding, we will order again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighborhood. It's expensive but the quality is well worth it. Sauce is slightly on the sweeter side but that's right up my alley. Crust is absolutely perfect. Topping options are plenty (sun-dried tomatoes are my favorite). Delivery is fast. Enough said."}
{"text":"Have ordered pizza from here before and they never disappoint. I've tried almost every pizza they have and the deep dish is the best to me. The only problem is the two times i got the deep dish my sausage was a little pink. While it's nothing a microwave can't fix, it would be nice if i didn't have to. They have the best pizza I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"The Pizza is awesome, the staff is good but on the side when you order a large Thin crust Pizza my family and i got yelled at because we ordered 2 Large with extra cheese thin crust and refused to do but it we were the last customers to order thin crust. So the next time you wanna order it make sure you check first and they will tell u yes and or no."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because it was our go-to for convenience.      ---   ---   ---  I was staying at my Grandmother's house in Broadview Heights for about a week during the NBA Finals. Broadview Heights is not exactly a haven for local business, and Romeo's is located conveniently on the way to I-77 from my grandma's house. Because of all of those factors, we probably ended up here 3 or 4 times during my Cleveland trip.  We actually only had pizza one time, and went with sandwiches on all the other visits. Each sandwich and pizza that I tried was the definition of 4-stars: solid. Not bad, not amazing, but solid.   But again, the convenience factor is strong here. We would call 15 minutes ahead, and our food would be waiting for us upon arrival. If you're looking for the convenience of fast food, without the low quality, Romeo's is your answer."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!   Ordered pizzas for work several times and they've always been hot and fresh.   Love all the choices of specialty pizzas!"}
{"text":"Not good enough. Very pricy and the delivery services always mess up something or forget something. Longer than usual delivery times.  Don't recommend, much better pizza options out there"}
{"text":"We had a 50% off coupon for an XL Specialty Pizza, so we ordered their Pepperoni Feast pizza. When we got it home, there was very little pepperoni on it. We get more pepperoni on a one topping pepperoni pizza at a shop near our home. Even with the coupon, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"OMG stopped this afternoon for a quick pizza, and that is what it turned out to be. 15 minutes!! I spend that at McDonald's!!! And what a pizza great sauce and great dough. It's my go to pizza for know on."}
{"text":"A good chain pizza joint...Kinda on the expensive side.  They usually have coupons or specials running."}
{"text":"The crew at Romeo's on Snow is awesome. Drew, Sarah, and the rest are great. I order a few times a month and they are fast and delicious!!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Romeos is our place to go for good, solid American style pizza.  We love the great Ranch and Potato Pizza.  Its not cheap, but its not expensive either.  Also enjoy a number of the other specialty pizzas and they deliver and I have not had them mess up my order ever.  Of my pizza dollars, Romeo's gets the most and deservedly so."}
{"text":"You either love sweet sauce, or you hate it. The people you hate it, should just steer clear of this place and stop hating on the pizza itself, because Romeos has the best pizza ever! If by any chance you don't like sweet sauce, you have GOT to try the Great Ranch Potato pizza, it has a ranch bacon sauce with sausage, potato, carmalized onion and ranch dusted almonds. It is the best pizza I have ever tried! I've been going to this location for about three years and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but the last two times I've ordered, they screwed it up. The first time, we ordered \"white\" pizza (with garlic butter sauce), but they made it with regular sauce. Tonight (a Sunday night...almost no one there), we ordered pizza online for pick up at a certain time; came in 10 minutes after the order was supposed to be ready, and they hadn't even put it in the oven yet! It ended up being 25 minutes late. And they didn't say/do anything to recognize the issue. Anyways, probably not going back."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I ever put in my mouth. I would rather have a hot pocket. The crust tasted like a sponge. The flavor was like someone dumped a can of that food pantry pizza gunk on a sponge and put in a toaster oven. The hot wings were even less appetizing."}
{"text":"Everything was hot and delicious. Speedy, friendly delivery. I'd give 5 stars but in my opinion it's on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I need to apologize to Romeo's for having been a customer for the past 6 years and neglecting to write a review.  We have ordered at minimum twice per month over those six years.  And every time the order has been on time, correct, and looking and tasting how I expect. You have consistently helped us out with dinner and get-togethers with your delicious pizza, wings, and bread sticks. The rewards programs is a great bonus too.  I am sorry for taking you for granted."}
{"text":"Ordered online and was told 55 minutes. Pizza arrived in 100 minutes. Pizza was cold and burned. It had many bubbles were there was no sauce or cheese. It was inedible."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza.  im still waiting to find the best! prices are good, staff is friendly. that always helps."}
{"text":"Love this location!  I live on the border of three cities....it's challenging to get a pizza place to deliver sometimes.  They deliver without hesitation and it's hot and fresh every time.  I love their pizza too!!!"}
{"text":"We all order on line right? Well I placed a $30+ order according to on line menu...had no idea they stopped making pasta..placed order for rigatoni sub and salad, garlic bread ...paid with credit card..they get here with sub and salad...No pasta..and ask for payment! Told me they dont do pasta anymore so i ask why is it still on the menu and why they didnt call me. So i told him its not my fault and i dont want the food and this jerk told me it was my fault. Said he talked to me on phone and i said it was ok!  Got people here wanting the pasta...well im not eating in front of them! Sad place. Unprofessional!"}
{"text":"It's a good pizza place if you don't want a \"sit in\" pizza joint.  The pizza over all was good.  The bad thing, and this is coming from a health freak, they were a bit on the greasy side.  Also there prices were a little high end for the size of pizza you get.  I had the Ranch and Potato Pizza and it was a good pizza, if you want different.  I would go again, but not too often."}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty but a bit pricey.  If you are going to try them out make sure you check online for their special deals, makes the cost a bit lower"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and am very picky about my pizza. This is the only place I'll get pizza from. They make their own dough and sauce and all their ingredients are fresh. I saw some people complain about their delivery times- sporting events and certain holidays are insanely busy in pizzerias. I don't know why they wouldn't just go pick it up themselves. In the words of Jim Gaiffigan: \"I like your food, but not enough to pick it up myself...\" It's a small inconvenience for good food."}
{"text":"My favorite local calzone! Always a long wait when I pick up my order, a little chaotic, but the calzone is delicious! I'm a weirdo and get pineapple, onion and banana pepper ... love it! I also love that they are close to my home."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the prices are very reasonable. Great service on delivery and carry out. I couldn't really tell you what's my favorite food item here because we order different stuff each time. What i can say for sure is the steak topping should be everyone's go to topping if you're not sure, its soo good! Not far from home, just simply good!"}
{"text":"First time trying out Romeo's Pizza... I am from California and I don't believe we have this... The nice girl named Jennifer told me that when she tried Romeo's Pizza it was by far her favorite pizza place... So we ordered the well known special large traditional butcher shop with a side of garlic parmesan sauce. I do consider myself a pizza snob (is there such a thing) because I am so picky with my sauce cheese and the crust. The bacon was yum moving to the sweet tomato sauce to the delicious sausage. I was in Homer Simpson pizza heaven I tell you!! I will be trying out all the different types soon enough!"}
{"text":"I had ordered pizza  and they said 40 minutes, I called them at 70 minutes figuring they couldn't find the address,  when I called they said they lost my information but when I called them back  they knew who I was. Didn't offer any rectification. I was so pissed. Will never order again. And I really like their  pizza."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Romeos when I lived in Columbus.  Its a chain, but its nothing like Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc.  Quality pizza has always been a constant theme of every location Ive been to.  The Twinsburg location has always had great pizza.  Ive never bothered buying wings or anything else from them because I love the pizzas.  There are 3 places closer to where I live, and Romeo's is too far to deliver, but I gladly drive there to pick up the food."}
{"text":"The pizza is always fresh and delicious, but oh my god they have to step up their delivery times. Every single time I order, it takes them over an hour to get to my house. I'm only 3 miles away!"}
{"text":"This review is for the new location on Rocky River Drive in Kamm's Plaza.  Very Good service and quality ingredients; the garden salad is very nice with non-iceberg lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and black olives.  Had the veggie deluxe which had nice fresh red onions, tomatoes, black olives, and green pepper.  Not a huge amount of cheese but fine with me.  The only negative was the sauce--It was way too sweet for me.  This is a good place if you like your pizza sauce sugary."}
{"text":"Romeos is a special treat for us because it's about a 15 minute drive from where we live and they don't deliver here. But except for rather high prices, we've never been disappointed. The sauce is great and the veggies are fresh. Their wings are great, not greasy and tasteless like some other places. They've never messed up an order.  The staff is friendly and professional. I was shocked to hear that their Solon location closed!"}
{"text":"This pizza is close to me, so I get it almost once a week. I have to agree with the last review Cynthia, this pizza sauce is pretty unique. It's hard to describe but I'll do my best. It has a subtle sweetness to it, rounded off at the end by what is distinctly basil, and possibly some rosemary. The cheese is quite chewy, and typically cooked until brown on the top. Most of the fresh vegetable toppings you can tell are prepared in house, while some are as expected canned.   The boneless wings also aren't bad, although fairly run of the mill.   This place is a classic standby for me."}
{"text":"Food was ordered over 30 minutes ago and is still not ready for pickup. Fail!!! I have been to several \"chain\" pizza places and never waited this long for an order."}
{"text":"Romeo's has an alright pizza but terrible breadsticks. Have gotten over cooked breadsticks in many occasions as well as not getting any sauce with the breadsticks. Find another pizza place that isn't Romeo's, their pizza is average so you're not missing anything. You'll just be avoiding terrible quality if you go somewhere that isn't Romeo's."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza ! The sauce is quite amazing and topping generous. Especially the chubby  crust, it just melts in your mouth along with the veggies! I am into quailty food even on pizza and I can say this satisfies my taste buds. If you want outstanding pizza this is the place . Just a pick up  place but the service is pleasant and helpful in all regards with finishing on your entire meal including the usuals I don't indulge in; I happened be organically oriented with craving now and then   you won't regret ordering here all the best foodies !"}
{"text":"Pizza , service, & atmosphere . OT's next door serves it up along with tons of other good stuff with drinks ! The owners always make you feel special"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to pick up pizza. The sauce is the best part, it's a sweeter sauce- really delicious. The online coupons are great, there's always a good deal/special going on. I do online ordering and the pizza is always ready on time. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"If you like cold food, order from here. I ordered the margherita and garlic cheese bread. Both arrive very cold. Driver didn't have a pen. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like Romeo's but they keep making it hard.  Yes, their sauce is good.  It's about my favorite to be honest.  You pay a lot for what you get.   I guess you can argue quality over quantity.    I ordered a pound of wings and a \"Tuscan\" salad.  The salad was advertised as \"Lettuce, Fresh Tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmesan Cheese, Balsamic Dressing\". The lettuce was very crisp and the tomatoes ripe.   The mozzarela was good but there was no parmesan and the dressing was Marzetti in a plastic pouch.     My pound of wings was...how to say...underwhelming.   I transferred the wings, minus the half inch of buttery sauce, into a dish that I had zeroed on my kitchen scale (new and calibrated).  Total weight was 8.2 ounces.  Last time I checked there were 16 ounces in a pound.   Have a look at the photo.   I'm wondering what kind of chickens they're getting these wings from.     For the occasional pizza it's ok.  Otherwise...."}
{"text":"I have probably gotten 40 pepperoni mushroom and jalapeno calzones from this location. Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"This pizza is always good; possibly the best in the Medina area. The sauce is slightly sweet, the pepperoni nice and crunchy. Got the \"thincredible\" thin crust as a \"pepperoni feast\" last night. It was very good, and very cheesy, but they didn't slice it very well (had to get out my own pizza cutter). Would probably order from here more, but it's a bit out of the way from where I live (and very few places deliver to my neck of the woods)."}
{"text":"Customer service was Awesome. From California and they treated us really good. They told us there specials and they recommend. Nice place, Pizza was really good. Must say different from Pizza Hut and Dominoes Pizza. Will hopefully be back again on our next trip to neighborhood. Very Friendly people here."}
{"text":"had Romeos for the first time today (Saturday Oct 18,14).  and I am not quite sure what to say in this review.  The pizza wasn't bad, and it wasn't great.  The LOADED breadsticks lacked any imagination, flavor, and toppings (D+) on the breadsticks.  now lets get to the heart of it, the pizza.  for starters, the pizza WAS hot.  it had just enough cheese on it, and the peperoni was tasty.  The problem came down to the sauce.  after 3 slices, I felt my blood sugar rise, and I couldn't eat any more...not because I was full, but because the sauce is way to sweet.  the crust reminded me of what Costco pizza is like, and its fine for Costco, but to pay almost 20$ for a pizza is WAY too much.  (C) on the pizza.  The salad was ok (B).  overall it was OK but I thinks the 33.00$ (with tip) I spent , would of been better spent if I drove to a Costco.  not the greatest, not the worst.   overall (C-)  Pros:  hot, quick,  Cons: WAY TOO sweet, WAY TOO expensive, breadsticks lacked flavor,toppings, and imagination.  OVERALL:  I would not go back, but I would eat it if someone else bought.\  P.S.  pizza was bought at the KAMMS Cleveland location."}
{"text":"After being in town for 10 days I've decided this is the hands down best delivery spot in down.  First night I got boneless wings with hot buffallo sauce and a large traditional pizza with green peppers and pineapple.  It was very good and great quick delivery.  Second order, after I'd tried literally everywhere else, I got boneless wings with honey mustard sauce and a large thick style pizza with pepperoni.  Both were better than the first time.  Super good, between dinner and lunch I ate it all.  Ordering again tonight.  Delivery is super fast, so why not."}
{"text":"We have bought pizza from here in the past and it was perfect and delicious. This time, we bought the special called Sean's favorite. Online, the picture shows the pizza covered with pepperoni and crumbled sausage. The pizza we were given had a very scarce amount of toppings. On 10 slices of pizza, there were only 20 pieces of pepperoni. Very little sausage too. This was very disappointing. We'll have to try the Solon location or go back to Twinsburg. I could have bought a Little Caesars pizza for $7 less and get the same quality pizza."}
{"text":"Wow.  We haven't been here in a while, but we ordered the Tuscan Pepperoni pizza today. Amazingly Good!! The woman in the front was very welcoming and friendly when I picked up. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza!  Sauce is the best. Friendly people at the counter. No other pizza place in Medina can compare to Romeo's."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! I usually go cheap when it comes to pizza, but I've learned that Romeo's is worth the few extra bucks for its saucy deliciousness. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Order there all the time use their app. Pricey, but worth it. Always hot, always on time."}
{"text":"I use to be in the Pizza industry and this pizza fails due to the sweetest sauce I've ever had on any pizza in my life.  It also Fails as the crust is tasteless and cardboard like.  The Cheese was the only saving grace of this pizza.  I would give it two stars but  when a $5 dollar georgio's Pizza beats you thats just sad. Their crust and sauce destroy romeo's .  This is a review for the 130th location... but i'm sure the pizza taste the same at any of the other locations."}
{"text":"While I am a pizza snob and totally favor the Chicago pizza styes- deep dish, stuffed, and thin, I do love Romeo's.  The sauce does it."}
{"text":"Yes bought pizza there a few hours ago, the kids that worked there were very nice but the pizza was not good. The cheese was at the point of the pizza none at top the sauce no flavor and the part with no cheese was very thick and to have no ingredients on top made for dry bread. They had the door open where the workers are flies, bugs can fly in and one girl was standing by the door smoking, I don't think that's a good thing.  So I won't go back, had a large onion and mushroom ate 1 piece pitched the rest. Waste of my money. Pizza doesn't look like the pics where everything is spread wven"}
{"text":"This place has probably the best pizza sauce around, it is very unique,sweet and delicious.  They also have good appetizers and subs and such. The people there are always nice and courteous from what I've seen.  Not the cheapest pizza but not too expensive either."}
{"text":"Place an order by phone for two medium pizzas for takeout 15 mins prior to pick up. Arrived, sales person had to get a manger to ring up sale. Seemed clueless as to my order. Once I paid, waited aprox 20 minutes for pizzas to come out. Was told that the order wasn't quite ready; i.e. they missed it and never filled it.  Sat for  aprox. 20 mins in a hot pizza shop while they filled my order that I had called in 15 mins prior to showing up. No apologies, no coupons, didn't seem to care that they screwed up. Pizza was good, crust crunchy on bottom, vegitarian pizza was loaded, no skimping. However, service bad, wasted my time. Benefit of doubt,  labor day weekend and may have been slammed."}
{"text":"The box says it all...best pizza in the Midwest.  It's all in the sauce.  Romeo's is truly some of the best pizza in the Midwest.  I have found memories of pizza lunches in grade school provided by Romeo's.  Over the years I have grown to love it even more.  Don't be fooled by the name...they have more than just great pizza.  You should check it out when in Medina.  They now have a burger place next door which I believe you can also buy the pizza from."}
{"text":"I don't know how this pizza wins awards, in my opinion it's on par with pizza hut or papa johns. just ok. the ordering and delivery service was very good tho."}
{"text":"Was watching the Browns get whooped on at my parents house and we decided to get pizza.  Pulled up my trusty Yelp app and saw what was in the vicinity.  I had an All Around Town coupon for a free medium pizza when I buy one.  Hells yeah.  Ordered sausage and pepperoni on one, ham and  banana peppers on one and some sort of deluxe for he third.  Didn't go near the deluxe because it had onions.  My fellow Yelpers know how I feel about damn onions!  All 3 pizzas were really good and I would get again.  Crust a tad thick for what I like but it was OK.  Even with the coupon the total came to 33 and some change.  Pizza is expensive these days.  I will have leftovers so that makes it fine with me.  Im sure there are more hip or \"indie\" pizza places I could of went to but this place did the trick and they were nice.  Nice goes a long way..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas.  I've been ordering from the store since it opened.  On the whole, most of the staff are friendly and try to do a good job. The only negative is that I've had a few errors, relatively minor, on my orders over the last couple years, and they (not just one individual) seem resistant to making it right.  I don't have that issue with other places, typically, and certainly not consistently.  Fix that and it'd be 5 stars.  I still go back because I like it, but not everyone will be that forgiving.  They are good at having it ready when promised."}
{"text":"Just had Romeo's for the first time yesterday! I had the gluten free pepperoni and my husband ordered two medium pizzas, one sausage and one pepperoni. My husband enjoyed his pizzas. Not the best he has ever had but pretty good. I thought the gluten free was pretty good also. It wasn't too greasy and the gluten free crust was actually pretty tasty. The staff were friendly and parking is pretty easy. It is located in a plaza on the corner of Stearns and Lorain so getting in and out is a little challenging, if traffic is heavy. But overall, pretty good. We would order it again."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was wrong to give Romeo's such a bad review, because even though I left my leftover pizza in the work refrigerator too long and had to throw it away, when I went to toss it I had discovered that some sneaky food-stealing co-worker ate about 2/3rds of it already.  To risk: 1) eating pizza that could have been weeks old 2) eating pizza that could have had gross I-dont-wash-my-hands-after-I-go-to-the-bathroom germs on it (for all they knew) and 3) the possible embarrassment if I had caught them... suggests that this pizza must actually be damn good."}
{"text":"Amazing italiano! Some of the best pizza ever! Great sauce!  My favorite pizza in Cleveland!  The crust is so fresh tasting! I personally recommend picking it up I had problems with delivery once and never did it again is literally a block from where I stay so no big deal!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Romeo's twice now. 1st time I got calazones. This time The deep dish pizza. The sauce is way too sweet for me. Both times I got wings. Those were pretty good. They could be a tad more crisp but they are flavorful. I don't think I will get it again but I tried it."}
{"text":"The delivery was fast the drivers are nice The food looked good tasted great and it was easy to order online and they have a variety of food options to choose from"}
{"text":"Let me just say, I'm a pizza fanatic. I'm constantly trying new places and I have officially hit the Jack pot.  I was rather confused when I first opened my box and saw sauce on top. I thought they mixed up my pizza with someone else's. I then noticed the cheese and was like hm... This is a perplexing pizza. I took a bite and said a few astonished profanities at the awesomeness that my tastebuds had just experienced. By far, the best pizza I have had in the area. (and I've had about 10 or 12 places in the Cleveland area) seriously, check this place out. Even if you're anti-chain. You are missing out on phenomenal pizza."}
{"text":"I don't want to complain too much here since I only had the gluten free pizza, but it was god awful. I just happened to have a coupon for Romeos and decided to try it for lunch today. Now I know gluten free can be drab anyway...this was the bottom of the barrel. The crust was tough like cardboard, yet crumbled...think about that. How can that even happen? The cheese was tough and the onions were burnt. I don't need a long review to tell you not to waste your time. The regular pizza could be ok for all I know, but the gluten free is a no go."}
{"text":"I love this place there always so nice and my son just loves the bread sticks. The rest of the family loves the godfather and onion rings."}
{"text":"The sauce is so sweet that you can hardly taste much over it. Don't bother with the deep dish, it is just a super thick crust.  These guys haven't been to Antonio's and def never Chicago.  $6 for 6 wings... I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Well, we love Romeo's. We are a bread loving family, so their think crust and sweet sauce is our fav. And the garlic sauce is better than Papa John's."}
{"text":"It was like 9pm on a Tuesday night and we were hungry for pizza but with the newborn, we really wanted to stay in.  My problem with being Yelp Elite is that I am always trying something new, this occasion was no different, I really wanted to try another pizza joint around town to compare with others I have already tried.  So Romeo's was running a special that if you bought a large pizza you would get a small appetizer free, cool, sounded good to me.  We went with the large pepperoni and small boneless wings, spicy garlic.  The pizza itself was good, better then some other places around my house such as Tony's, Vargo's, and Little Caesars HAR.  The pepperoni was crispy around the edges, the pizza had a good crust, nice cheese ratio, and overall good size to the overall ZA.  One thing that another Yelper pointed out is that the sauce is a little sweet, which I don't think I minded, neither did the wife, she said she really enjoyed the pizza and I can't EVER disagree with her....lol....nah...it was good.  The boneless wings were good-great, meaty, fantastic flavor, light breading, just a really tasty boneless wing.  So I have been fighting over what star rating to give this place and I am bumping it up from my original 3 stars to 4 because of a few reasons. 1) They delivered it in less then 25 minutes (7-10 minutes away). 2) Zeppe's didn't offer delivery, or at least their website indicated it was pick-up only, not to mention one other place I called wouldn't deliver either. 3) Boneless wings were better then expected. 4) Pizza was good heated up.  So 4 stars it is!  Given my location and what my options were without leaving the house that night, I'd say everything turned out pretty well."}
{"text":"We've been fans of Romeo's ever since they opened in Broadview Heights. Are they perfect? No, but they get close--and when they screw up it's been our experience they try hard to make things right. Last night a part of our order wasn't as it usually is. Called Romeo's and they apologized and immediately offered to make it again and bring it out asap, and they did exactly that.   In all the years we've been customers I don't actually remember getting something we didn't like. Sure, some things are better than others but that's personal taste. We love their pizza's and we've tried a few different types. Their wings are probably the best in the area. Haven't tried their subs yet but will.   At the holidays I send a pizza or two to favorite local stores as a small thank you, and things are always taken care of exactly as requested. Their store manager (Jim, I believe, apologies if that's wrong) took it upon himself to make sure it was done right.   So, yeah, we'll keep ordering from here and look forward to enjoying their food. Nice job, Romeo's."}
{"text":"This is a chain and it's not the best pizza I have ever had but it gets 5 stars from me for being the best chain pizza out there. I have never had a bad order from this Romeo's and I have been coming here for years. They are always very friendly and my orders are always done on time. I can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!   Delivered quicker than promised and just the nicest delivery guy every!    Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Sweet sauce.  Great customer service.  Garlic bread was okay and Jojos were pretty good.  Good hot sauce, too."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good and staff is polite. They do get a little backed up on busy nights like weekends, when games are on, and when no one wants to go out in the rain."}
{"text":"Okay the only reason I went with romeo's was because they were opened later then the pizza place I like. Oh my god. First off i was given a quoted time. When the guy got there with the pizza. He did not knock on the door or ring the doorbell. He opened my door stuck his head in and said pizza. Seriously. I know my door was unlocked I was expecting pizza or to go out in a sec. The guy opened the door.  just opened the door. The pizza was greasy as all get out and really gross. I cannot see how this place is a 3 times winner or how someone would give you over a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"My family loves Romeo's pizza! We order from the Highland Heights location about once a month.   Ask for a side of pesto, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! The sauce is superb. Wings here are also very good. Always fast service. This location does not have seating inside, so get pick up or delivery."}
{"text":"Placed an order for several pizzas over an hour ago, and the lady on the other line said it would be 30 minutes. We were on our way to a concert and they claimed our order never went through, we purposefully waited to pick up this for dinner and they claimed it never went through.  Everyone in my family was very upset about the poor customer service. When we told them about what happened, there was no apology or concern for the inconvenience that they had intimated."}
{"text":"This is my pizza I received tonight from Romeos pictures will be included if I could give them less than a one star I would it look like somebody slammed my pizza begins the door or something and then it supposed to be the pepperoni feast there's hardly any pepperoni on top  to say the cheeses burnt on top but somehow they managed to get the inside of the Pizza raw When I called the manager to complain he acted like I was lying and told me he wanted the pizza back what does he think I'm going to do with it I can't eat it obviously so go ahead and have your pizza back maybe you should take a picture of it and show your district manager the crappy pizzas you're making on Friday nights trust and believe me I'll order from Antonio's next time it'll be a heck of a lot better"}
{"text":"We ordered two medium pizzas for delivery this evening as we didn't have time to cook.  When the pizzas were delivered, they were smashed to one side of the box.  Apparently, the driver was in a hurry.  Or maybe he got in an accident.  Anyway, it's been a while since I've had a smashed pizza.  We ate it.  It was still good.  We're not complainers.  Hopefully, Romeo's staff see's this and acknowledges the issue so that it doesn't happen to others.  Two stars for delivery.  The veggie pizza was solid.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The crust was soft and tasty.  The cheese pizza was very good too.  I give four stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"Despite reading reviews that they screwed orders up I decided to give romeos a shot SHAME ON ME!!!!! Despite the ticket saying all of the correct items I still received a pizza with only one of the three toppings I requested. SHAME ON YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this pizza was horrible. Just because the sauce is O.K, doesn't mean the pizza needs 5 cups of it. Way to much sauce.  Not enough cheese, in fact barely any cheese; when I got home I melted more on because all I had was a tomato sauce pizza. And don't ask for basil because it'll just be pesto squeezed on top, Even when you ask for fresh basil. Overall I would've rather taken Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Romeo's multiple times because it's always A.) Fresh B.) On Time C.) Delicious. I'd say the only real downside is that it can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in the area. It's over priced but for someone who has to eat gluten free, there's no other option. The crust is very thin but it still tastes great. I have even grown to liking their gluten free pizza better than the regular pizzas. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivey.........quick ...less the 30 min everything was hot and correct friendly driver amazing will be ordering again next time I'm here"}
{"text":"Just a word of advice, if a delivery order is going to take longer than an hour and a half, maybe try giving your customer a heads up. When I have to call after 90 minutes to inquire about where it is and I don't even get an apology, you can count on never hearing from me again. I like their stuffed crust pizza, but I'm going elsewhere from now on. Customer service counts for something."}
{"text":"Undercooked Strombolis, average pizza that doesn't heat up well the next day. Greasy pizza and appetizers. No thanks."}
{"text":"Called Romeo's to deliver for the big game.  Total fumble.   After 1 hour of expected delivery, we finally called to check in.  \"Romeo's, Romeo's wherefore art thou?\"   At the end of the conversation, no food and no delivery for the game.   No pizza.  No wings.  No offer of future comp.   Disappointed and still hungry and mouths to feed.   With other pizza shops swamped, I ordered carryout from Rusty Bucket in Solon.  Good stuff!  Siracha wings were great!   And so was the Big Sicilian pizza at Rusty Bucket.   I was to Rusty and back home before other pizza joints could deliver.  I'm pleased!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to order pizza delivery. The employees are always friendly when taking your order and delivering, the delivery is usually quicker than the estimated time and the food is delicious! Our favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza with extra buffalo sauce for dipping. They also just added online ordering!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza. My wife is from Buffalo and says this pizza is the best in Cleveland. The sauce is sweeter but that's what makes it so good."}
{"text":"Decent food...  We have been ordering from Romeo's regularly for delivery at least monthly for a couple years.  They were always fast and friendly. Last time though, I placed my order, gave my credit card info over the phone as is my habit with Romeo's, and confirmed my address.  Then I waited the 35 or so minutes.  No pizza.  Was patient and waited another 35 minutes before calling.  I was told that my order was placed for pickup...rather illogical considering they had collected my credit card info and confirmed my address. Hubby decided to go pick up the pizza...he left to do that... THEN... I got a rather nasty call from the manager stating his employee \"swears up and down\" my order was for pickup, and that I was wrong.  Since I'd already resolved this by offering to pick up,  I can't imagine a reason this dude would call me, other than JUST to tell me how wrong I was. Very unprofessional. Not the only delivery game in town, just the rudest."}
{"text":"Few things shut down my appetite like witnessing someone vomiting or even seeing puke. I don't know. Maybe it's just me but I find it really objectionable. Even the smell is troubling.   Other reviewers might say Romeo's Pizza is too sweet or has unpleasant off-flavors associated with their pizza, but after a long hot day dealing with people fighting airborne pathogenic infection, it really can hit the spot. I stopped by the other day on the way out of Broadview Heights and decided to grab a large pizza.   Or two.   You see, they have some interesting and unusual offerings including one called 'the butcher shop' that has a lot of meat on it (cooked) and another called 'the ranch lover's chicken pizza' that replaces cheese with ranch dressing and comes with a generous amount of little nubs of chicken. It has a shiny glaze to it that you would not expect from a pizza slathered in salad dressing. I got one of each.  I know what you're thinking. I ordered too much and we're going to come full-circle on the clever vomit intro, but hold your literary presumption. The pizzas were awesome! The meat pizza did in fact evoke thoughts of a place where meat primals are broken down into component cuts and I really did find myself loving the idea of a house without an upstairs while gutting down slices of the salad dressing pizza.   Both types were tasty and worked well to trick my hypothalamus into forgetting the day's wretchedness. When I finished my meal, everything smelled like pizza to me instead of smelling like vomit. I even had enough for leftovers the next day!  If I can enjoy it after a day like I had, no one grinding through the day in day out horror of postmodern social and environmental degradation within the constraints of Broadview Heights could look up with mouth full and not say, \"This pizza tastes great!\""}
