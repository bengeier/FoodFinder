{"text":"Very slow service. Karaoke was late starting due to not being prepared for a new system. We asked for our bill and it took forever to get it and she never came back to take out payment. We ended up having to pay cash at the bar."}
{"text":"After a long day of work D and I agreed we were due for a pub night.  He suggested we try this little pub, if it still existed, that he used to frequent back when he lived in Calgary 8 years ago.  So off we drove, got lost, and ended up finding the place in a little corner of Airdrie right where it used to be.  First impressions - I probably wouldn't have thought to go in if he hadn't been with me.  There were people standing outside smoking and the windows were coated in something that gave them a mirror effect so you couldn't see inside to see what the place looks like.  His memory of the food was enough to encourage giving it a try anyway and I'm rather glad we did.  On the inside it's sort-of golf themed, and looks like your typical darkened pub.  We sat down at a table on the end of a column of 3 joined tables, in the quietest corner there.  Right away our server Shelley came by and gave us menus and took a drink order.  He had 2 Heineken bottles over the course of the meal and I had a Strongbow which thankfully came out of a bottle and not a can.  If it's not on tap I prefer the taste of bottled Strongbow, rather than the weak-flavoured metallic canned version.  For food D ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and gravy.  The fries were crisp, the gravy rich and thick, and the sandwich I didn't steal a bite of but it was supposedly quite good.  I might try their pulled pork pizza next time.  On the other hand I tried one of their supposedly famous pizza's: the Cheeseburger.  It's one of their top selling pizzas and I can see why.  Crust: the perfect halfway point between thin-crust and pan-style so it was crispy but not overly crunch and had great flavour. Toppings: there was lots of everything on top, with a great undertone of taco seasoning which worked great!  Lots of ground beef, sauce, cheese, enough that half a pizza was filling even as a 10\"! Leftovers:  Your typical fast-food pizza tastes like cardboard the next day.  Not so with this.  I saved 2 large pieces for lunch the next day and honestly it was almost as good as it was fresh out of the oven.  I probably could have left it in the toaster oven a few more minutes but even then it was delicious on the second day.  The only sad thing is their appetizers seem to be rather expensive for what you get.  I'd have to see a serving size of the deep fried dill pickles before I order one because 4 pcs does not sound like a lot for the cost they're charging.  I would definitely order that pizza again and i will be going back to Bogey's."}
{"text":"I've been going to Bogey's for years.  Yes, it's still a dive bar.  Yes, it's still loud on busy nights or when there is a game on.  Yes, it's still fantastic.    The service has been above average every time I've gone.  Even on busy nights it has still been better than most comparable pubs.  The best part of Bogey's is the food for sure.   The amount of bad meals I've had at Bogey's in 15+ years I can count on one hand.  I've had probably everything on the menu at this point and it's all great."}
{"text":"Had a great time playing Name That Tune!  Great staff and they were super cool even though we were super loud.  The food was pretty good too..I have Chicken Souvlaki and Greek Salad..which is something you wouldn't normally order in a bar and it was actually pretty decent."}
