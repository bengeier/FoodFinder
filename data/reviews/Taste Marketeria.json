{"text":"This place is pretty decent and reasonably priced.  It's a mix between Whole Foods and a gourmet food joint.  They have a good mix of baked goods and higher quality groceries (e.g. avocado oil) and a sautee bar and hot table at the back.  We tried their burger and the fish combo.  The burger was pretty good (6.25) and you can add aged cheddar and fries for $1 each.  In terms of the fish, it is fresh and the veggies are organic, which is great. For $9.95, it is quite reasonable.

Verdict: Decent, and something fairly reasonably priced on Lakeshore in Oakville."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. One side was like a cafe with a bakery case and about half a dozen tables. The other side was a kitchen where they serve burgers, sandwiches and pasta. The seating area is a large communal table. You can also buy prepared food to bring home to cook.  All around are grocery items, teas and coffee beans but I found everything very pricey. Ill stick to only coming here to eat or for coffee and a treat."}
