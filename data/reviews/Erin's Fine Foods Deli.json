{"text":"The older bald guy who does the checkout is SO OBNOXIOUS and will short your change by a few cents because he can't be bothered with pennies. He thinks that because he says hi in the most gruff way possible, he is being polite."}
{"text":"They have many good vegetarian options and the price is right for the quality of the food.  The veggie sandwich that is always on the menu is delicious. I tried the bean burger special, and it was OK. I appreciated that it was clearly homemade (and a vegetarian special), but all the ingredients just didn't quite jive into a cohesive sandwich.   The mixed vegetable option that comes with the sandwiches is a nice touch. Nothing to write home about, though good enough that I always opt for that instead of the pickle, and I like pickles. Otherwise, they have a decent selection of sides to choose from for an extra cost."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown, great sandwiches, soup, salad, and side options! I have even done catered boxed lunches for a large group and they were excellent! One critique is that on he occasions I have ordered soup, sometimes I get lots of meat and veggies and other times it's mostly broth. Despite that, all the soups I have tried are great!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Friendly staff, wide variety of salads, soups and sandwiches. Everything is freshly made to order and if you're in a hurry there's a \"grab and go\" section. I recommend the red white and blue salad, which is a spinach and avocado salad topped with strawberries, blueberries, mandarin oranges, feta cheese and almonds. I added chicken to mine for $2 more. The baked goods all look amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Went out for lunch today and like most days in this boring city I was wondering what to do for lunch. I was looking for something fresh and non commercial. I heard about Erin's catering service and knew that the food has always been good! So I got the bang bang chicken wrap and it was very good and fresh. Just what I wanted that day nothing heavy. I would absolutely recommend this deli. I told all the guys at work about it and they even commented on how good my wrap smelled. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I mostly go to this place because they have a gluten free option, but I find it ridiculous that every couple months the price has changed. The only sandwich I get from there is GF bread, egg white and bacon only that nothing else. When they opened I paid $4.01 then $5.35 and now $6.15. I have tried to give Erin's a chance because the lady that makes the sandwiches is always so nice, but every time I purchase a sandwich in there I feel like I'm being swindled by the guy that's like their only cashier. Their food isn't high end and not worth the price. For anyone looking for a deli with reasonable prices that don't rise every couple months I strongly recommend Eadie's Market. I get the same sandwich for $4."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a week. Recently started getting breakfast items as well. I love the breakfast souffles, and have not hesitated to get them for lunch as well - seems like a no-brainer! It's tomato and goat cheese (or ham and cheese) perfectly good, hot lunch entrees, right? I think so. Still working my way through the sandwich offerings and getting side-tracked by going back and getting old favorites. I always get a soup, always, and sometimes that stuffed pepper soup is its own meal, and so good! My firm has also used Erin's for catering lunches and this has been a big hit. Their boxed sandwiches and salads are simply superior to the usual offerings from the \"chains\", even the pricier chains."}
{"text":"Well I work in the bldg next door, I went in there the first week and had the Balsamic Pulled Pork sandwich, which was fabulous, told everyone in my office how great it was!  I went in for a second time and Poof the  sandwich is terrible and I mean all around terrible, soggy bread & a lot less stuff inside and barely cooked, totally disappointed..also their pick up system needs tweaked big time.. To many places in town that are consistent to wait thru their line again.."}
{"text":"Erin's has been open for around 109 days now.  They say that 100 episodes[1] is a measure of success for TV Shows, and if the regular lunchtime crowds are any indication, it looks like Erin's is upholding this law with delis, too!  I first reviewed Erin's when they initially opened, and wanted to revisit the review because I've since been there dozens of times.  Erin's staff sets them apart from many of the other businesses downtown.  They are friendly, engaging, helpful, and efficient.  The food is generally good to great, with some of my favorite items being the Mediterranean wrap(no meat!) and a modified Turkey-avocado Salad turned Chef Salad by adding ham and replacing crumbled bleu fromage (never liked it!) with shredded cheddar.  Both the wrap and salad are delicious.  I also like the fact that they sell many a la carte things for both snacking and assembling a simple meal.  For instance, they offer delicious mini tarts, pies, breads (like lemon bread), and pastries.  They have various chocolate covered fruits and nuts.  They also have a couple types of fruit cut up in small containers.  I've been known to get a couple hard-boiled eggs and some fruit for breakfast.  They have the made-to-order line, and the cashier line separate, and so if you're in a rush, you can grab something from the cooler, pay, and be on your way.  Smart!  So if the staff is great, and food is pretty good, and the pastries are tasty, why not a 5-star rating?  The thing that really holds Erin's back is the weak showing on the breakfast sandwiches.  My friends and I have tried no fewer than (5) different types of sandwiches, with/without eggs, with bacon, with sausage, and they all feel uninspiring, boring, and tasteless.  Their four or five types of coffee are always hot, fresh, and powers me through boring meetings.  All in all, Erin's is a solid place for lunch, and I'm glad to see they are still thriving after the 3.5 months they've been open.  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_episodes"}
{"text":"I had literally the best lunch in recent memory here.  Rice bowl with chicken was PERFECT.  The reason this place doesn't get five stars is because there appear to be a cadre of gross regulars that get preferential treatment.  I was waiting for someone behind the counter for someone to take my order, some sloppy Yinzer cut right in front of me, started yukking it up with the staff, and no one even acknowledged me.  Hopefully the customer service gets better, and if it does please let me know.  I won't be returning despite excellent food because trashy obnoxious middle aged sloppy dudes in faded polo shirts make me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"I really liked this place at first.  I got a samwhich that had blue flakes of something in it.  I called and the guy seemed annoyed but said they would replace it.  The guy firgured it was something from a previous pastry that was warmed in the oven.  Okay, fine.  Then today I get a sandwhich, not once, but twice I am spitting egg shell out of mouth.  What the h###?  Does this place not care about quality anymore?  Sidenote:  the bacon twist, meh....good bacon...that's about it.  Probably not going back."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for our office. They have a variety of options that are reasonably priced. I wouldn't say that it is the healthiest food option in downtown, but everything I have tried was good and seemed fresh. It is a little hidden in the bottom floor of the building, which leads to it being less crowded than many other places at the lunch hour. I would recommend it for a quick take out place if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I like Erin's, but I went today at 3pm and was given a choice of only 2 options because everything was \"cleaned and put away\". I've worked in food service so I get it but if your store hours say you are open until 4pm then you should actually stay open until 4pm."}
{"text":"I would give this place about 3-3.5 stars.  Cons: average wait time at lunch is around 20mins.  A sandwich and drink will easily set you back $10 dollars.  Pros: good food, close to work  Suggestions : have combos- 1/2 salad and soup, 1/2 sandwich and salad ect. Include drink in the price . Hand out numbers for guests eating in. That way there aren't not 20 people in a group by the check out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bang Bang chicken sandwich is a favorite, as is their stuffed pepper soup. Baked goods are awesome too. Individuals who work there are friendly for the most part, but some look at you like you are inconveniencing them (esp the guy at the register) so that is why I knocked them down one star. Overall work it for a nice and relatively healthy/fresh lunch  or breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Prices are too high for the quality of the food which has steadily decreased since this place opened. I can no longer justify spending almost $10.00 dollars on a disappointing sandwich."}
{"text":"Great lunch location!  The workers are super friendly and seem just way too happy to be in there - maybe they are paying them partially in desserts?    I am sadly always good when I am in there, so I haven't tried their amazing looking desserts - cupcakes, cookies, scones, sweet breads, other amazing-ness...  But the rest of their food is amazing.  The first time I went I had an egg white, avocado and cheese bagel.  Delish and felt very healthy.  The next few times I have had salads.  The first time I had a turkey avocado salad.  They chop the salad which to me adds a lot to it.  I like being able to get all flavors in one bite. The last two times - I go there a lot, yeah - I have had the cape cod salad.  It's dried cranberries, blue cheese, pine nuts, red onion and a white vinegarette on spring greens.  Normally, I would add some meat to it, but this salad is so fresh and lovely tasting all by itself and is super cheap - $6.25 - that I don't even bother.   I would tell you to go, but then I'll have to wait in line longer, so don't go.  Let me go alone way too frequently :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here and I'm lucky because it is in my work building! I've been here many, MANY times for breakfast and lunch. They have reasonable prices and great options that include salads, wraps, sandwiches, soup and PLENTY of delicious pastries.   A few of my favorites include the Chicken Caesar Wrap, the Bourbon Steak sandwich, the Spicy Meatloaf and the Bang Bang Chicken wrap.  The staff is very friendly and the food is good. My only warning is that this place gets PACKED right around noon, so either be prepared to wait or go a little earlier/later than the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"I work in the same building as Erin's, so it's a really convenient spot for me. In the same building, you'll find a Starbucks, except that Erin's coffee is way better. The hazelnut and the Kona blend are both fantastic, and I've come to prefer them above any other coffee around.   Now I'm usually the pack-my-own-lunch type, but on days when I need to buy something, Erin's is also my go-to. Real, fresh ingredients and not a bunch of pre-made crap, with a unique menu in which anyone could find something to suit them.  I've had too many things on the menu to name, from breakfast sandwiches (seriously the best in downtown), to salads (such generous portions that don't skimp on the chicken and other good stuff), to sandwiches (bang bang chicken is a favorite!), to wraps - seriously, all of it is good.   And while I'm not connected, I just met the real Erin behind the deli this morning while picking up my coffee, and she's as nice as can be. The whole staff is. It's just an awesome place over all that I'd recommend to anyone looking for a quick lunch spot in downtown."}
{"text":"Nice Place. Better than the quizno's that it replaced. It was clean inside. Expanded to be bigger by knocking out one of the walls. You order at the counter. The man running the counter was funny. Recognized one of my friends and called her Lisa. (Lisa wasn't her name but he played it off). We laughed. You then walk down the isle and pay the cashier at the end. The food took maybe 5-10 minutes to prepare.  I got the bang bang chicken salad. It's made with a spicy peanut sauce. I also got double chicken since I work out. I don't know if it was really \"double\" since it looked like about a breast worth of chicken but nonetheless I'm glad they could accomodate my dietary need. I got a drink and a cookie and my meal came out to $13.50. Again my fault for getting double meat, prolly would've costed around the $11 range otherwise.  Portions here are pretty small. Usually deli's are known for getting a good bang for your buck but here the portion sizes are ample. They use plastic containers that are half the size of a regular one, so you get about half the salad you would anywhere else.   The bang bang chicken salad and wrap come with mixed greens, nuts, cucumbers, roasted red peppers and its bang bang asian peanut sauce. The chicken was shredded and tasted good. I'd give it a two thumbs up.   Now that I have tried the new place on the block the big question comes up, would I go back? Sure If a coworked asked or if someone wanted to try a new place. But I wouldn't have cravings for this place like say a chipotle or five guys. It's good, quality somewhat healthy foods at somewhat moderate prices. But in a community that's filled with such diverse options, being good may not make you stand out among the crowd."}
{"text":"I visit here when I don't have anything to pack for lunch, it's very close to my workplace, so it's convenient, but some things are hit or miss. The sandwiches I've had have been pretty good. However sometimes I've received a wrap with very hard avocado in it. I'd rather they just tell me they're out of avocados than put an un-ripe one in a wrap. The salads are good, but sometimes low on the meat portion. They use a fair amount of dressing, so I usually get that on the side. I was a big fan of their \"bowl\" options. They occasionally have brown rice bowl specials on their menu that are pretty healthy and pretty good. I was obsessed with the salmon option when they had it last year, so good! However today I ordered a \"Chipotle Chicken Bowl\" that was supposed to have grilled chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a light chipotle sauce. But when I opened the container at my desk, I had received some kind of asian bowl with soy sauce, brown rice, cashews, and asian veggies. I don't really like soy sauce, so I wasn't happy, but I didn't have time to go get my order corrected as I had a meeting soon. I was super confused by this because I didn't even see an asian bowl on the menu, the chipotle bowl was their special bowl for the day. They weren't busy at the time, it was just me and 1 other customer waiting for food, so no idea how this happened."}
{"text":"Erin's Fine Foods is a great little shop for lunch. Walking from Grant St, I couldn't find this place originally, but it was hidden inside the K&L Gates building so it took me 2 tries until I got it right.  I love that this place always has really fresh food and I'm pretty sure I had the best chicken salad of my life here. They have a daily special which can be worth checking out as well. Even though the lunch can seem a bit pricey ($10+) for what it looks like, the food quality is definitely there and worth it.  Just make sure you hit this place at the right time, or end up waiting for a while (at least 15-20 mins)!"}
{"text":"I started going here as soon as I started working in the same building. I was told from coworkers that the breakfasts are good but the lunches are hit or miss. I have purchased both breakfast and lunch options, as well as bakery treats, too many times to count. Therefore, I will say the following:  - Breakfast is usually great. The souffles are amazing, the smoked salmon on a bagel is superb, and it's moderately priced for downtown - around $7 for a breakfast and coffee. The meals fill you up to get to lunch. The coffee is also great and simple.  - Lunch is usually a miss for me. I liked the Stuffed Pepper Bowl but it is seasonal. Everything else I have tried has not been good. It's kind of like dressing up - take one thing off at the door and you're good. They need to remove one \"extra\" and it would be a great lunch. I don't feel like I get my money's worth on the lunches either. Maybe throw in a bag of chips and a drink too rather than the pickle or vegetable option. Also, put some signage up saying how lunch needs to be ordered because you feel a bit like a novice idiot when you don't realize you tell the person with the notepad your order and name, take that to the register and pay, and then wait to get called.   - Sweet treats are really good - great cookie selection and interesting takes on classics. The only one I didn't like was a scone that was really dry. But I did get it at the end of the day so maybe it went stale?  - The refrigerated section is full of different salads and fruits and is usually good. Twice I purchased some spoiled hard boiled eggs but out of probably 100 times that is bound to happen. I think they've gotten more stringent on that though with the dated labels.  I really do enjoy the people that work there. Some of them seem a little rough around the edges but their personalities grow on you. The register seems to be a revolving door but I think the new woman they have is a good fit - she's friendly and fun.   My recommendations would be: offer total meals for breakfast and lunch like a meal and a drink for $X, offer a punch card for frequent guests so I feel like my choosing them for food is rewarded, re calibrate the lunch offerings and pair down on some of the unique ingredients on sandwiches, and monitor the refrigerated items closely to make sure you aren't labeling spoiled food as still good for a few days."}
{"text":"Located in the bottom lobby of the K&L Gates building on Sixth Avenue, this place has everything from sandwiches to wraps to meatloaf to salads. I have ordered the balsamic pulled pork, the Italian wrap (best if cooked in the oven for a few minutes), the spicy meatloaf, turkey diablo and the roast beef before and they are all really good. The Italian wrap is probably my favorite, although the meatloaf includes a spicy chipotle sauce on it that is really good. The employees are very nice and talkative. They have a nice selection of salads, cookies, chips, etc. You also get either veggies or a big pickle with each meal.  Great little place that will cost you between 8 and 13 for lunch depending on what you get. I go here probably once a week because it's good and convenient for me."}
{"text":"This deli is hidden inside the K&L Gates building. Very convenient if you work right in the area.   I have tried many things here - sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), salads, soups. Everything usually does the trick, but feels overpriced to me. At lunch, their sandwiches come with a pickle - you have to pay more for a drink and/or chips, which basically everybody wants. Once you pay to add chips and a drink, the price becomes not worth it. For a grab and go type of place at lunchtime, the prices don't reflect that. You order at the counter by where they are making the food, then take your check to the register and wait in that area for your meal. This process isn't very obvious so it would be nice if they put up little signs like \"order here\" and \"pay here\".   They do have a few tables and chairs if you want to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic food all-around! I have ordered from Erin's several times now, and the food and quality are consistently good. Everyone is super friendly and the restaurant itself is a neat little place tucked away in the bottom of the K&L Gates building.  One of my favorite items on the menu is the 'Bang Bang' chicken wrap. The dressing is to die for (homemade fresh, with peanut butter and spices!). Definitely worth a shot.  The fresh baked cookies are also extremely tasty, and they do offer gluten-free options as well, which is a plus!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my fav downtown lunch spots!  A good selection of wraps, salads, soups & amazing cakes!! Veggies are fresh and meat is decent quality. Pastries are too delicious. The staff is always super friendly and accommodating. Usually a short wait- the one time I did wait longer than normal, the manager on duty noticed and gave me a free cookie!! Works for me!"}
{"text":"This place automatically gets bonus points because it's close to where I work.  In all fairness though, I give them a solid 4.    1)  Friendly staff - everyone here is so nice.  They recognize you when you come in, they say hi, ask how you're doing.  Try getting that at Starbucks.  2)  Reasonable prices - enough said.  $1.97 for a large coffee.  Sold.  3) Baked goods are crazy good.  Do yourself a favor and get a blueberry scone or a white chocolate raspberry scone and ask them to heat it up for a few seconds.  I'm talking life-changing flavor.  It's like eating a muffin top with that little crustiness to it, but the WHOLE THING IS LIKE THAT.  And then they put some icing on it, you know, for good measure.  If you want to be happy while simultaneously hating yourself for not eating healthier, this is the ticket.  Those are the top three reasons why I like Erin's.  The sandwiches I've had so far have been decent, but not quite at the level of the baked goods section."}
