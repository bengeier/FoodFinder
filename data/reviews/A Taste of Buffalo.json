{"text":"Ambience is rustic w/ Buffalo Bills memorabilia. Service is quite helpful & courteous. Wings had a crispy exterior & moist interior. The outer sauce wasn't overbearing & the flavor was robust. This mist on the outside patio has a nice touch on those hot days and especially if you bathe your wings w/ the HOT sauce before consumption."}
{"text":"Two people have brought me food from here. So awesome! I can't wait to get a babysitter and actually go in! Lol"}
{"text":"If you like good Buffalo food you will love A Taste  of Buffalo. The food is authentic Buffalo food and is absolutely delicious. A must for anyone but especially if you are from the upstate  New York area!"}
{"text":"Amazing Philly Cheese Steak!!! So delicious!!! The onion rings are out of this world!!! Highly recommend you check it out!!"}
{"text":"What a cool little spot! Even though they are working out the kinks now, you can tell this place will be awesome!! The food was great, to start we did have the hot wings which, no joke, will make it hard to enjoy wings anywhere else (that good), also im a sucker for a great italian sausage sandwich, so I was definitely skeptical but the sandwich came out very well prepaired and enjoyed it greatly!!! The kids had chicken fingers which they seemed to like alot"}
{"text":"Came here with family from Buffalo. They claim the Kimmelwek rolls and the beef were both done to perfection. A real taste of Buffalo."}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place!!!! Great food, best onion rings I've had in a long time. Amazing and friendly service. Prices great for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Great place for everything Buffalo!!!  Heard they now serve beer as well!!!  Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I grew up in Western New York and its almost impossible to find good Buffalo Wings and other Western NY food favorites in Arizona. This is the spot! They get the wings right! So good! The wing sauce is just like back home. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Third visit in a month.  Tried something different each time.  I agree with the poster below that the wings need some work.  A bit dry but edible.  The Hot Dog Special was fantastic. Char Grilled, piled high with condiments.  Their chips were good too, but could have been just a bit crisper.    Wife had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, and it was huge. She made two meals out of it. She really enjoyed it and said she can't wait to try their other items.  Overall - a very good experience. Just needs a few tweaks with a couple recipes."}
{"text":"great food. hot dogs are killer. wings are the bomb... if they were Pokémon I would of caught them all."}
{"text":"First time. Of four items we ordered, we rated them according to preference. #1. French fries #2. Wings with honey bbq sauce. #3. Beef dog #4. Onion rings. Very clean. Seemed friendly. We're first in line after opening, so they were busy setting up Ted hot dogs in Tempe are our favorite and we had hoped they would measure up. Not quite. Onion rings very greasy. Nuclear green sweet relish.  Fries were the best ever.no stubs. Not too salty. Huge servings."}
{"text":"Food here is great. The Royal is one of the best sandwiches I've had in long time and the wings are so good. If you're looking for something for dinner you need to get over here."}
{"text":"This place is great. It definitely reminded me of being back in Buffalo, eating a Sahlen's hot dog. The owner was there and is a very nice guy. We talked about Buffalo for a few minutes and it was a nice stroll down memory lane. I will definitely be back again! Even if you're not from Western New York you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Far too pricy for the quality of their food. And the beef on weck is so bad, we couldn't finish it, between 2 people. It tastes like they cooked salt with a little bit of dry beef in it.. on top of that the weck contains salt, so that made it even worse. While we ordered our food, the cashier was burning someone elses hotdog on the grill and I'm pretty sure our order was rang up wrong, but the receipt they give you has no information on what you ordered so i couldnt be sure. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"As a buffalo native, I am always looking for something to remind me of home. One thing I've found hard to find out here is good wings and good beef on weck. This place has got them both. Their wings had an awesome crisp and the flavor was spot on. The beef on weck was just like home. It's a family owned business and they are buffalo natives. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good buffalo food! They even have Sahlens hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Taste of Buffalo!  It is just like the name. We are from Buffalo, just like the owner Mike. . And we know our Buffalo food.  Beef on weck was fantastic!!  Roast Beef is stacked high!!and so tasty!!  My husband had the charbroiled hot dogs, also very good (just like Teds! ). We will definitely be back again to try the buffalo chicken wings!!"}
{"text":"Not too bad, I had the Philly Steak. Meat had good flavor, too many peppers for my taste. I asked for pepper jack and got provolone. Hubby had Beef on weck, it didn't have cheese which he said would have been better. But said it was decent. Onion rings ok."}
{"text":"First time here. The beef on wek and homemade chips were the bomb! Wife had the onion rings and they were crispy and delicious. A friend had one of the hot dogs, after eating his beef on wek, and said it was great. The restaurant was clean and good service. We will definitely will go back."}
{"text":"My family and I have been trying to find a great place for Philly Steak sandwiches.  We all agree that A taste of Buffalo is now our \"go to\" place.  The onion rings were delicious! Friendly staff and a clean place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal! I had the two hot dog special with the freshly made potato chips and it was so good I HAD to go back a day later for more!!! The owner recommended The Royal which I have yet to try! 5 stars from me, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The hot dogs, wings, Philly cheese steak, and the meatballs...excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food. However, the seating choices are limited. Very tall cocktail tables or very tight picnic tables. What ever happened to regular table and chairs."}
{"text":"Very huge portions.. especially for the philly steak. Everything was delicious, and staff was very nice and friendly, and not intrusive. Will be going there again."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place and clean as well. It has a  New York theme. Love the smell of the food when I walk in.  I got the wreck on deck sandwich. It had the most tender roast beef and plenty of it in that sandwich. The fries were crispy and delicious as well, some of the best!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place...Wow... I got the all beef hot dog with all the trimmings. It was grilled perfectly..kinda like Ted's in Tempe. They did not skimp on the sport peppers and tomatoes. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in yesterday for lunch with no expectations.  We were amazingly surprised at the food at this gem of a restaurant!  After looking over the menu, Mike suggested I try the beef on weck.  I had never heard of such a thing so I thought I would give it a go.  This was a French dip on steroids!  Flavor and quality were excellent.  My wife tried the spicy chicken sandwich and it was excellent as well.  All of the sides (except the French fries) are house made and we tried both the onion rings and potato salad and they were incredible.   Unfortunately, we did not have room (each took part of our meal to go) to try the hot dogs.  They are imported from Buffalo and grilled over wood.  We will definitely be back to give that a try!  This place is definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Best wings outside of buffalo - just perfect, not at all greasy! Onion rings, beef on weck, potato salad - all so authentic. Yum!  We all enjoyed our supper (haven't called it that since living in buffalo) tonight! We'll definitely be back next time we're in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This place literally made me ill. I almost filed a complaint with the health dept. I was so sick I couldn't get out of my bathroom... I had the Wreek and meatball sandwich both smelt good but after eating part of both , well, not to be too graphic it wasn't pretty..."}
{"text":"man this place in bad for my health I over eat everytime  I tried the beef sandwich it's all about that bread so good the onion rings  made fresh too"}
{"text":"Looking for lunch or dinner this place is great. Good food for a good price. I've tried several items on the menu since they open hasn't disappointed yet. Friendly owner and staff. Make you feel welcome every time you go. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Food :) worth the drive. Wings are amazing. The name is so fitting... It truly tastes like Buffalo."}
{"text":"My wife & I went here for the first time, but it sure won't be the last. After driving by their sign for a month or two, we decided to check it out. So glad we did. My Wife had a Chili Cheese Dog and I had an Italian Sausage with peppers & onions. We shared a 6 piece wing, and some onion rings. With a soda, it came to $20. Totally AWESOME food, GREAT service, GREAT price. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. These guys got it right, and at just a few blocks from my house, this is going to be my new GOTO spot!"}
{"text":"I am not writing this review on the food at A Taste of Buffalo. I am reviewing the service. Why you ask? How can you review a restaurant with out tasting their food? Well..... We (a party of 4) arrived at 6pm. We finally had our orders taken at 6:39. 1 foot long, 1/2 dozen wings and 1 beef on weck. I was told when I ordered it would take 20 mins for my food. The restaurant had a special gathering for Buffalo Bills Backers. At 7:09 I caught the eye of the food runner, held up our numbers. The runner came back and said you food will be right out. At 7:29 (50 MINUTES LATER) I went to the counter and said I would like a refund because I waited 50 mins and still did not get my food. The guy at the counter did not even check on my order... he just gave me a cash refund and said sorry.  Well...... I can't eat sorry.   Mike Juliano how can run a hot dog stand and waste 1:30 hrs of my life. You see patrons sitting for 1.5 hrs with no food and you can't send out some chips,bread or frys gratis. To sum up this review..... we went next door to Cucina Tagliani Italian Kitchen. At 7:35 we had drinks, bread and soup. At 7:50 we had our entrees. WOW a real restaurant"}
{"text":"Food was meh. Four and a half stars seems ridiculously generous. We asked for our order to go, yet it sat in the pickup area for dining in but nobody called our #. We just assumed it was ours.   Had a burger with ketchup and mustard - heavy handed on the mustard. Was good, but the bun would've been better toasted. Philly cheesesteak was nothing to write home about. Not sure where all the reviewers have eaten cheesesteaks, but if they think these are the bomb, they have seriously been missing out."}
{"text":"I created my own burger once I saw that they were actually cooking with charcoal.  I was not disappointed.  The burger was full of flavor and juicy.  Actually the best burger I have had since moving to Arizona two years ago.  My boyfriend ordered The Royal. It was enormous. He loved it and said he would definitely order it again.  His new favorite sandwich.  And don't forget to try the  onion rings...........AMAZING!!! I highly recommend this place. Oh and dine in,  the location is very clean."}
{"text":"Sahlen hotdogs cooked over charcoal, medium rare beef on weck with real horseradish not the creamed stuff, simply awesome!! I will be back again."}
{"text":"Yo yo my local Az peeps this place is a hidden goody !!! Go out and give it a try and judge for yourself.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place a few weeks ago and my girlfriend (who has family from Buffalo) and I were itching to try it.  Starting off with the negatives:  - Stopped by on a whim because we realized it was near by and had our dog with us so I pulled up the website on my phone and the menu was impossible to read.  No problem, I went to go get a to go menu from inside (since they boast about taking it to go).  Was told that they didn't have any due to them being reprinted... ooookay, so i take a picture of the menu with my phone so that we can order.  - We are guessing the reason that the menus are being reprinted is because the prices are being raised (I posted a picture of the menu that I took and check out the website, in some cases a $1.50 increase on some items!)  - The food took about 15 minutes from when I ordered it to when i was able to walk out the door with my to go order which for an order of 2 hot dogs, and two orders of 8 wings (one mild, one honey bbq) seemed a little excessive but some of the frustration may have been to all the back and forth I had to do just to order.  - When the food was ready, they didn't seem to have much of a system of getting it to people or having the people get it, even though they issue numbers when you order.  - Almost $12 a piece for a hot dog and 8 wings (no side, no drink) seems a little on the high side especially when one of the wings I got looked like it wouldn't even make the cut on a 25 cent wing night at your local bar.  Okay, now for the good:  -  All that being said, the wings were really good, they aren't drowned in sauce, and they are nice and crunchy and overall very tasty.  - Hot dog was a quality dog, worth the $2.60, had a good taste to it with the charbroiled taste.  - I can see how if you were from Buffalo, that the inside of the shop would be pretty nostalgic, big mural of Buffalo, tv's in the corners with sports on, and the smell of good food cooking.  Overall for where we live, I don't know that we would make the drive all the way there just for hot dogs but we will certainly have added it to our list of place for when we are in the area."}
{"text":"My hot dog was amazing! Staff was friendly and helpful when I was ordering with my many questions. I would totally recommend this place to all my east coast transplants. I enjoyed being able to watch the kitchen grilling my hot dog to perfection!"}
{"text":"We have visited this place 3 times in the past two weeks and each time have thoroughly enjoyed their food. We enjoyed delicious char grilled hot dogs with ample toppings of mustard, sauerkraut, relish, chili etc....the onion rings are great- a must try! On our most current visit we tried the fish fry- two large pieces of breaded haddock(hard to find on menus in the valley), French fries, coleslaw and potato salad. The entire meal was delicious and left us totally full....My only comment for improvement would be to improve upon the coleslaw (too dry and not sweet) and maybe offer a one piece option for a little less money.... Our next visit we plan on trying the cheesesteak and meatball sandwiches.....keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is legitimate for back East neighborhood dinning.  Maybe the help is a little too nice to call it authentic (eg they are very friendly).  I ordered at the counter and they recommend the onion rings.  Wow, the rings were great.  Obviously made fresh on site.  The wings were high quality with the standard sauce choices, if you like wings you will be happy.  I also did a half Phily cheesesteak.  It was a big portion and tasted great.  The bread was fresh, soft in the middle and crunchy outside, the meat had enough juice to soak into the bread and the whole thing was buried in melted cheese.    Perfect casual dining for the Everyman."}
{"text":"Beef on Weck is a must have.  Char-grilled Salen hot dogs and grilled hamburgers are superb and the chicken wings rock as well.  This start up restaurant can't miss with these menu greats not to mention the many other selections that are available.  Looking forward to trying each one.  Fast service, friendly staff and great food makes this a mandatory stop."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my feed \"Hot and New\" so why not give this place a try. Good reviews for the start, walked in and noticed it was very clean. Got greeted like I was a legend a loud \"hi how are you today\" and everything he said was ending with a sir. I got the hot dog because he recommended it and a half Philly cheese steak, 6 honey BBQ wings and a drink about 17$. Which is responsible and I didn't care I wanted to try everything. Food was brought out for us and everything was amazing. The Philly was cheesy and the sauce was dripping out. The wings were crispy and just amazing. And the hot dog was incredible. I can say this place got my attention and I'll be back trying out everything else on the menu. It's clean, fast, hot, and just amazingly good."}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place out as it's fairly new in the neighborhood. The service was very friendly, they've definitely got that down. The fries are FANTASTIC, definitely got that down as well. The wings however, are a bit dry. There's just no other way to put it, they were kind of tough and dry but not horrible, the recipe just needs some tweaking. When I went to get iced tea something was up with it and it came out as this nasty syrup. There was also a HORRIBLE smell towards the back of the restaurant (maybe some one had one too many hot wings?).   I would love to go back and try their sandwiches but for a full sandwich we're talking $9 - $10 bucks and this is just not the kind of place I would pay that kind of money for a sandwich. The place definitely has some potential but needs some ironing out and tweaking as well."}
{"text":"Wow! A new family favorite! The cheese stake took us back home to the east coast. But the onion rings were the star because I am picky about onion rings! They were big, crispy and something I've never had because they are made in house and not the prepackaged crap. We also had the weck on deck and so good as well! We are looking forward to going back to try other menu items. The owner was a sweet heart and spent time talking to us and asking how we liked our food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Hotdogs, wings, beef on weck, onion rings and homemade chips are the bomb!  So glad it opened near us!"}
{"text":"My husband asked where I wanted to go for my 40th birthday and being from Buffalo, I wanted a taste of home. I love this restaurant!! The beef on weck is the best I've had in YEARS! From the pictures on the wall all the way to malt vinegar for the fries, this place is a great find! Super kid friendly and excellent menu options: philly cheese steak, burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, fries - all great choices!!! Thanks Mike!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended I'm a huge fan of their Philly cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here. First time tried their Beef on Weck, very good would definitely order again. This trip I had their two Hot Dog special. Wood fire grilled dogs with choice of condiments. They use Sahlen's dogs from Buffalo, NY. World Series playing."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch right after open. First time here. Place is huge. I ordered the cheese steak. Came out hot and crispy. Loved it. They have a regular size and a large. Fries were golden brown and crispy. Wife ordered honey bbq wings. They came out crisp and just enough sauce. A+ on the experience."}
{"text":"Would we come back again? Probably not.... Food was so so. I had wings, which were small and dry, like way over cooked.  The hot dog was good, but nothing special.  The fries were good and plentiful.  My husband had the philly steak, he said was just okay.  The food is not bad, but we found nothing to rave about.  The day we went it was scorching hot outside, the air conditioning in the restaurant was having a difficult time keeping up, especially towards the kitchen area.  We went to the back of the restaurant where it was much cooler.  The restaurant appeared clean, and you ordered from the counter and they bring your food to you, that all worked out fine.  It was the lack luster food that was our disappointment."}
{"text":"We have seen the sign for few months but We but never found the time to go in. We went in today and ordered a lot of food for all five of us. It was great from the wings to the hot dogs. cooked Fast and super hot. Great place for lunch or dinner. Nice and clean  very friendly staff. We will return for sure. Great addition to that corner and the winco  shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Great beef on weck and meatball sandwich. Order at counter and they bring it to your table."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the guys at Taste of Buffalo!  Today I had the Italian sausage with peppers, gravy and mozz. I took one bite and those peppers got me and I told my kid, it's like being in the City right now, OMG. The CITY being NYC for you unfortunate souls who have never been.  The kid had the chicken tenders. Really good. The battar was on point and the chicken was clean, white meat, just perfect.  Fries were on point, a great option, but my friends, let's talk about potato salad. I saw potato salad on the menu and thought, someone really believes in this stuff to make it a menu item. They have good reason. In this side dish you will find potato skin (they aren't faking it, they make it) and tons of goodness. I made a point to mention this to Mike Sr. and Jr. Turns it's mom's recipe and the woman is talented!   Order this side every time, complain that there isn't enough then pay for a second (these guys got to get paid and the stuff is worth it).  While you are there have a look at the kitchen. It's awesome, I want to cook here. Get a load of the professionalism of the staff. Marvel at the cleanliness of both the appliances and the staff. Enjoy the food, it's world class. Their stuff is amazing.  On a down side... decor is lacking, creature comforts need a bit of help, plating techniques could use a hug. These points are minor, so pay little attention here.  BTW, the GF got the Italian and I have no idea how they pack so much into a 9.00 Sammich and make money. Generous isn't a strong enough word.  Last but not least, the charcoal grill is frigging awesome. You fellas have it right. Throw a steak on that BBQ and you'll make a fortune!"}
{"text":"ALERT! ***********HIDDEN GEM********DISCOVERED!**************  This casual place has just opened and may be still in the tweaking stage but if you want the tastiest roast beef sandwich in town HERE IT IS!  The Signature Sandwich here is what they call a \"Beef on Weck\" that are normally only served in Buffalo N.Y. Technically it's not 100% truly a beef on weck due to a few small picky details but it's close enough for me and is one of the most delicious sandwiches in town. (beef on weck is hand sliced rare roast beef topped with horseradish and the bottom of the top weck bun is dipped in the au jus)   What makes this sandwich unique is the hard substantial roll that's topped with caraway seeds and kosher salt called a Kummel Weck Roll. They give you a BIG PILE of delicious great tasting roast beef, horseradish on the side and your sandwich is dripping with lots of tasty au jus. Your BIG MEATY Sandwich also comes with a side. We both had the delicious beef on weck sandwiches and shared the house made onion rings and the house made potato salad. Onion rings were ok and the eggy potato salad was very fresh tasting but a little on the bland side.  I dropped them a star for the wings. While they weren't bad at all they just were edible. They might be still tinkering with the wing recipe.  This is a casual eatery. You order at the counter, seat yourself and they run the food out to you.   They serve mostly just a few varieties of sandwiches. Beef on Weck, hamburgers, Buffalo made hot dogs, meatballs, local Peoria made sausage, coal cooked chicken, Italian sandwiches.  Portions are very large and prices are very low"}
{"text":"Finally a great place to get a hot dog around Glendale! First time in today and it won't be the last! Tasty, clean, fast, and affordable are words I would use to sum up this place. I admit all I tried was the footlong hot dog, but it was pretty good one; nice and charred and hot. And they don't give you crap at the counter for wanting ketchup (I can't count how many times I've gotten weird looks for wanting ketchup on my hotdog from other places, why is that so weird?). I was in and out in at least fifteen minutes (not that they pushed me out the door), so they're great for lunch! I'll be back soon to try out their sandwiches, and I am so pleased that I won't have to drive all the way across town to Ted's for a hot dog anymore! Oh, and while it's to be expected of places that have indoor grills, it was nice to walk out of the cold, rainy weather into a warm room that smelled amazing, so that was definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Hey not too bad. Good size place with very personal service. Got a charred dog and side of meatballs. Simple lunch but did like it:) Nice mom n pop type quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food across the board. Be aware that the onion rings and potato chips are house made and nothing short of special.  Beef on weck is great and I do not know of anywhere else to get them in Arizona."}
{"text":"Buffalonians would be proud.  For the many people who have moved from the New York area, and settled out west.  Finding that favorite hometown restaurant you left behind has always been a challenge. So for all the \"Buffalonians\" traveling or who have settled here in Arizona, \"Taste of Buffalo\" is a must  Taste of Buffalo has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two, so bring a big appetite. A Taste of Buffalo serves all the authentic deli favorites. Theres the charbroiled Sahlens hot dogs, hot/cold sandwiches, side salads, chicken wings, fries, onion rings, homemade potato chips, and desserts.   On this visit we sampled the Sahlens all beef hot dogs, Beef on a Weck, onion rings, french fries, and homemade potato chips.  The Beef on Weck Sandwich was delicious, piled high with juicy, flavorful, roast beef, au jus, horseradish, on a salted and caraway seeded roll. My nephew and sister devoured the all beef  hotdogs that were grilled to perfection. The onion rings, homemade potato chips,  and french fries were fresh, crispy, and so very tasty.  Taste of Buffalo offers delicious food, great service, reasonable prices, with that \"Buffalo\" personality. I look forward to football season and catching a Bills game on their tvs while feasting on great food."}
{"text":"Had great charbroiled skin on hotdogs. Watched a lot of great food go by. Ordered the chicken wings for dessert because they looked so good. Next time I am going to try the beef on weck or the Philly. This is a must try! You can tell that they really care about making good food!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome I'm already a repeat offender. Love the philly steak it's just full of flavor and they are super kid friendly love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The best onion rings,  Philly cheese steak and chicken tenders.  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I am a proud New Yorker...  and this place brings back so many memories of quality food and great people.  Eating a Sahlen's dog, incredible potato salad, homemade potato chips and watching Hockey was awesome. Can't wait until I can sit back and watch the Bill's games and enjoy a dog and a few beers (Owner said liquor licence is coming soon)  HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I think we went on their 2nd or 3rd day open. Good experience. They're working out a few kinks, but seems they're set to be a great sandwich/wing joint. It's counter service. They bring food to table. Self-serve soft drinks. Nice people.  We got an Italian sandwich and a beef on weck. Oh man, the meats on the those sandwiches were great!  Really good Italian meats and juicy, sliced beef. Tiny issue with the bread. Both rolls seemed a tad dry. Not bad, but we both thought that if the bread had been just a tad more moist, those sandwiches would go from A- to an A+. After we ate, we realized they'd forgotten the pickle spears, but we were full anyway, and again, figured they're working out kinks of a new joint. We split a hot dog too. Grilled and snappy, like you'd find in the NE. Really good hot dog!  I can't forget to mention the sides. Got the fries, which were hot and delicious, but my husband ordered the potato chips, and they were a nice surprise. We expected just a bag of Lay's or similar, but what came out were fresh cooked potato chips! Good stuff. Do not overlook the potato chips here!  Looking forward to trying their onion rings and other menu items soon.  Will definitely return. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Location: This place is right next to Cucina Tagliani in the same plaza as WinCo. Parking spots are easy to find as it is a private lot shared with other businesses. The dining area has a generous amount of bar stools, tables, and wooden booths. The entire place is spacious. One of the best places to accommodate large parties and families. There are two TVs for your entertainment. First, you place your order at the register. Then you can comfortably seat yourself wherever you please to wait for the food.   Food: The food exceeded my expectations. I decided to give this place a try because of all the rave reviews. Never have I ever had a beef on weck before. The owner explained what it was and how it was made. The beef on weck was bomb dot com. I love the kummelweck roll that had a nice mixture of salt and seeds. I dipped the roast beef into the au jus and was mind blown - savory and tender. The Philly steak was the best. The meat was tender and sauteed well with the veggies. Just a little warning that the sandwich does run on the cheesy side. I will have to ask for less cheese next time. The owner said that all the sides (onion rings, potato chips, and potato salad) were made fresh, except the french fries. Those potato chips I had today were legit - fresh and crunchy. Now I can tell the difference between homemade potato chips versus those from a potato chip bag.   Service: The owner was super welcoming. Judging by the amount of time it took to make our food, I can tell that everything is freshly made. I will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Great food got the chicken parm it was fantastic!! Had potato salad for a side and was very good.  The guy who runs the place was super nice.  Great portion sizes.  The atmosphere was that of a real city deli.  Lots of seating good for groups.  Two tvs to catch games on.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Buffalo at it's best, beef on weck right on, onion rings, wings, meatball sub top notch Highly recommend, hope to serve beer soon , tvs for football too. Arizona has another winner!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times in the last month. My husband and family went there for dinner. We then returned when my husband wanted to go back for his birthday dinner! I had the BLT, best BLT I have ever had. The bacon is crispy and thick! My husband got the beef on weck. He absolutely loved it! It's so different the the food you can find around here. My brother in law is from Buffalo NY, he went with us both times. He says it's truly authentic. He loved the beef on weck and the buffalo hot dogs! Can't wait to go back to this diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this hidden gem tonight. We had the wings, an all beef hot dog, onion rings, and a meatball sub.  The food was excellent. The place was clean as a whistle. The owner came out and talked with us after we ate,  and was amazing, super nice, really cares about his place and the customers. We'll def be going back."}
{"text":"This place is not lying with its name... Being from the buffalo area myself it was actually quite amazing seeing that this place even existed... And after trying their chicken finger subs, my girlfriend and I were instantly sold... If you want legitimate and delicious true New York food, then I deeply recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a philly cheesesteak, some wings and onion rings to go and the onion rings won the prize for tastiest menu item sampled.  There's a lot of tasty sounding sandwiches on this menu, and they are all muy grande without ordering the large size. Generous portions are a thing here- my side of onion rings (they came with my sandwich) were enough for two people, and as I mentioned, they were really, really good. I hate it when you bite into an onion ring and the onion slides out like a burlesque performer taking off her stocking by holding onto the toe and pulling it off of her leg. That didn't happen with these rings at all. They are coated with a light, floury batter, not bread crumby coated. If you're wondering if floury and bread crumby are actual words, zip it.   The cheesesteak was loaded with thin sliced steak, peppers and onions plus lots and lots of melted provolone on top of a slightly crusty white roll. I don't know what I was expecting for the seasoning, probably my usual salt and pepper plus a little mayo, but the flavor was sharp and savory almost like an oil and vinegar italian dressing. It was good, just not what I was expecting.   The Buffalo style wings were crispy on the outside and had a good medium-burn sauce. They were expensive IMHO at $1 a wing and small and not very meaty. I've had better wings in local places nearby and it made me miss those big azz wings at Wolfley's.   The atmosphere was very casual, tons of families here enjoying charcoal grilled hot dogs, and the kitchen was completely open which to me is a sign of a staff who cares about their food and want you to know that they're making it, not reheating it.   I'll be back for sure to try the hot dogs and the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good lunch stop. Still a new restaurant working out the bugs. The Beef on Week keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome hot dog place- REAL beef hot dogs on a REAL flame grill! Also had the Italiano sandwich-delicious."}
{"text":"Was looking forward since spotting their ad in a mailer. My daughters and I visited for a weekend lunch and we were all disappointed as follows:  Clearly this family owned and operated business has a lot to learn and if they keep the current course of action regarding the business operation they will not be open for long. 1. Sanitation NIGHTMARE!!! The teen at the front counter had chipped nail polish. Did these \"chips\" end up in someone's food? Typically, a no nail polish policy should be employed for behind the counter food workers. Another worker preparing food has full facial hair. Yuk! An approximate 8 year old kid playing with a Nerf football in the lobby for some reason ended up behind the food serving station and was starting to hand out food. WTF? A lady who had just been carrying a family member's infant began serving food, without washing her hands. This place is a sanitation nightmare! I mean kids running around in the food service area without any adult saying a word to them. I understand \"family operated\" but you must employ basic health standards. 2.  Not a good value: we ordered 2, fires, hamburger, regular hot dog and six wings. $21.00? Ouch! Fries were good, burger (chipotle) was flavorless and dry. The wings were store bought quality and had a taste, definitely not worth the price. They use the same quality buns that you get from Walmart. The hot dog, well was a hot dog. They seem to take a certain pride on this menu item, but honestly no specialty dogs?  3. Bulky to go containers. We had five full sized Styrofoam containers. What a waste of space and money.  4. Wait time. Hot, dog, burgers, fires and wings 15 minutes and they were not busy. We were the only order pending.  This place is \"family done wrong\". They would benefit from a restaurant consultant. We will not be back"}
{"text":"I actually came across this this place jut searching on Yelp. I am always looking for places that are out of the norm of restaurants. I had the a regular hot dog and six wings for my lunch and it was amazing! Nice char on the hot dog with great flavor with the toppings not overpowering the meat. Wings were cooked properly with a nice crisp to the skin and medium sauce was just the perfect amount of heat and flavor."}
{"text":"Always nice to see a true mom and pop shop open in the valley. Been hearing how good this place is so I figured we would give it a try. I ordered the foot long with sauerkraut, mustard, relish and tomato. If you are looking for a Chicago style dog keep driving north and buy it off the cart in front of the Home Depot. This dog was high quality and flame broiled over wood to perfection! The bread was fresh and the dog had a nice snap with wonderful flavor. For 5 bucks you can't go wrong! My daughter had the Philly cheese steak. Nicely cooked tender thin slices beef sautéed with fresh onion and mushrooms. The only complaint was that it was a touch too salty but really good! The cheese was plentiful and tasty. Onion rings on the side lightly breaded and fresh. I have to give huge props to the homemade potato salad made by the lady of the house. It was to dye for and one of the best I've had! Give this place a try you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Seriously everything I've had is so good, and the portion sizes are so generous! The owner and the workers in the back are all very nice and very accommodating. Worth trying for sure! (Also the ranch is fantastic)"}
{"text":"I've never been to Buffalo, NY but this is a little taste of home for those who might be craving a bite like from the ole hometown. Everything was top notch from the crispy on the outside soft on the inside bun to the delectable onion rings to the homemade horseradish which blows the creamy bottled kind away. The service was friendly and the table near me had a Buffalo native and their pleasure was evident, too.  The cooking area has an indoor bbq and they know how to use it. It's on the far west side of the Winco parking lot, so there's plenty of parking. I can't wait to return and try an authentic hot dog or maybe a BLT or maybe work through the whole menu, it all looked good!  P.S. It was a hybrid waiter service. You order and pay at the counter but they deliver to the table."}
{"text":"Food was really good. And the atmosphere was casual and noisy so perfect to bring my 2 year old. We got the philly cheese steak and split it, it was the perfect amount. The only thing that was annoying was we waited 45 minutes for our food and people who got there after us had there's already. Then when the lady finally brought us our food she didn't say anything like sorry for your wait. I didn't really care but just thought it was kinda rude."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened, they have an awesome burger that is fresh and NOT frozen which means I can get it cooked my way. French fries are just as good.  Slowly going down menu and so far I love everything. Staff is the best !!! Defiantly eat the home maid potato chips"}
{"text":"We had the hot wings and beef on weck. The wings were as crispy as Buffalo wings should be and the au jus sauce was fantastic. The customer service was great and the owner was very friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food 5 stars! Customer service 5 stars! A very comfortable casual atmosphere to top it all off!  YES, IT'S THAT GOOD! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place in a strip mall near 59th and Bell red one day and decided to give it a go for lunch. Went in a Sunday and was greeted by the staff (mostly family) all wearing Bills shirts and listened to the owner talk about How great Buffalo is. I've never been or really wanted to visit Buffalo but after eating here I might have to check it out! The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I tried the suggested Beef on Weck and boy was I impressed! It was so good I refer all day how I found some place close to home to visit on a regular basis. I was told what makes the Weck so special is the bun...and they were right. Served with generous amount of roast beef and fries at a good value. I was stuffed after eating the sandwich. I'll definitely will be back because of the food and the friendly, family staff. I really hope this place makes it and hopefully Yelp will help it last!"}
{"text":"I had the Royal sandwich. Different than any sandwich that I've had. It was a great combination of flavors. The wings were crispy like I like them. There is much more on the menu that I will have to come back and try."}
{"text":"I haven't had a beef on weck in years... totally filled that void here! I've been whining about Arizona food since we moved here and now we have a place right down the road that helps get me by between visits home to Buffalo. If you're not a wny native, I'd be careful going here. You'll be sad eating anything else."}
{"text":"Recently moved from CA, let me tell you.... These wings are amazing! Way better than anything in SoCal. This is my go to spot when I'm feeling hungry. The owner is extremely nice too."}
{"text":"Grilled Hot Dogs rule! Great food was hungry grabbed a dog wings and fries and have left overs. Hot dog was made the way I like it the wings were perfect. I hate gnarly wet wings and these were perfect crispy and good sizes not dinky wings like I have seen. Be back for lunch or dinner for sure"}
{"text":"First impression, big open space cool setup with grill center. Like the wood around the walls and the cheesy pics of buffalo.   Was craving wings and hot dog so no room for beef on weck, next time. Wings were good. Nothing special though. All beef hotdog was yummy really hit the spot. Deep flavor and grilled.   My big critique is the dust on the soda and tea machines in the beverage area. They just need to make sure place is spotless.   Staff super friendly walking around and talking to customers. The guy that took my order however was boring uninterested and don't think he knew the product very well. Hopefully they make better decisions on staff moving forward they should have as much enthusiasm for the food as the owners do.   Support local and show up get a beef on weck check out the pics of buffalo and enjoy a little NY in AZ."}
{"text":"Food here is okay. I ordered a hot dog and it was a little too charcoal-y to me"}
{"text":"This is the place for authentic buffalo ny food!! Just opened and ready to feed the hungry soul. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Chicken wings were spicy and crispy and served with blue cheese dressing (without asking) and the beef on weck was wonderful, authentic and the weck roll wax perfect.  Onion rings were amazing... Best I've had in a long time!  Can't wait to go back and try the hot dogs."}
{"text":"This play was pretty good. We came at night, but it was practically dead. The owner was more than willing to make us feel welcome, though. It was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Large open kitchen with a grill behind glass in the front. Seemed to be family owned with the entire family working. I ordered the Cheesesteak sandwich with homemade chips. The order took about 15 minutes to arrive, looked awesome and tasted great with my only complaint the way it was cut. Seems the cook was trying a biased cut but did it in a way that left one 1/2 missing 2 inches of top bun and the other missing 2 inches of the bottom bun. Truly a mess to eat and confusing at best. All in all the chips and sandwich were good and on my next visit will ask for a straight cut or try one of their burgers as they looked great also."}
{"text":"WOW. This place was what my taste buds needed! Its everything i hoped it would be. The prices are a bit up there but its well worth the price. The food is amazing. The place is big inside with a lot of seating. The customer service is friendly and staff are mellow and outgoing. Great to have in a place with amazing food.  I got the Beef on Weck with onion rings. Those were the best onion rings ive ever had. Very much homemade. I couldnt stop eating them and i ate more than half before even getting to my beef sandwhich. Now the beef sandwhich was amazing too. Seasoned perfectly. The sandwhich came with au jus. I did not like the au jus one bit. It smelled like wet dog for some reason? Not a nice beefy smell which was weird. But the sandwhich didnt even need the au jus. If a sandwhich that comes with au jus doesnt even need it then that really says something! Its a must get if you come here.  I also ordered the wings, medium. The wing sauce was not what im used to but i still loved it. Coming from a bad experience from a wing place the other day im happy to report these were perfect. Which is really sad that a place that doesnt just do wings has the perfect wings. Sounds silly to me. What i will say is i asked for my wings extra crispy and i didnt get them crispy... i was a little sad about that. But still very good. They dont charge you for extra ranch which i admire from them.  There was an older guy seemed to be the manager who was making sure the staff was wiping down tables and cleaning the salt and pepper shakers which was very nice to see. It looked clean and it felt even more clean to see them constantly wiping things down. I give them major props for that. He was very helpfull and interactive with the guests. I hear their hot dogs are good, honestly i cant wait to try those. Im not a hot dog person but im hoping they will change that. I will be back probley tomorrow too!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! When someone advertisers having Buffalo food, I have expectations since I'm from there! We had wings, beef on weck, a cheeseburger, Italian sausage and the hand battered onion rings were pretty tasty too! The owner's son greeted us when we walked in the door and was very courteous and personable. I even got to chat with the owner about the Bills which was pretty cool. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Beef on Weck in the valley! Great atmosphere and even better staff! Cant go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place - great dogs and casual atmosphere. Great place to watch all the games. (5 TV's).  The food is Really good and the owner takes care of you.  I like that - this is my go to place for Football Season !"}
{"text":"Hot dog and Steak Sandwich was great buy fries and onion rings were NOT even warn..."}
{"text":"Super flavorful sandwiches.  I've been twice and have not been disappointed. Try the fresh hand battered onion rings! Also the owners and their sons are super friendly people.  I'm happy to continue giving them my business."}
{"text":"Hands down best beef on weck ive had in a while!  Just moved to arizona from Buffalo 6 months ago and this place is unreal! The  kimmelweck roll was perfect! Sahlens hot dogs, royal subs, chicken finger subs. Only thing missing is the Logan berry ;) Owner is awesome! It's always nice to meet people from Buffalo. Buffalo people are always good people! Telling everyone we know about this spot!"}
{"text":"Tried their special, 2 regular dogs and a drink for $5.  Added fries for another$2.    Fries were great and huge portion.  Dogs were char grilled and very tasty with a neutral taste, not to spicy nor bland.  Bun was warm, could benefit from a steamer instead of to short time in radiant oven.  Had a generous helping of mustard and relish which may have sucked the heat out of the dogs as they were warm but certainly not what I would call hot..  They have many items on their menu and looking forward to trying some of them.  Would have rated them 5 stars had the dogs been warmer.  Overall a good value for the money."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing!  The owner and his wife were so friendly!  CANNOT wait to go back and get their wings again!  Sister had the spicy chicken and she loved it.  Son had a burger and he said it was great.  Definitely going to be a \"regular\" spot for us from now on."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half for food, but they had a event tonight and they were slammed, so I'm sure it isn't like this every day. Nothing on the menu is vegetarian, but everyone else's food looked great! Loved the skyline of Buffalo on the back wall. Cool place, just wish they had something other than just meat on the menu."}
{"text":"The owner was really friendly and fun to talk to. The staff was also friendly. The food was pretty good and there is a 10% student discount here! Not a 5 star just cause I wasn't blown away with the food I got."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Sandwiches were delicious and I loved my onion rings!! Tons of food and at a great price. Their staff is so friendly and answered all our questions about the menu (since it was our first time) we'll definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"We had the cheeseburger and fries along with a footlong chili cheese dog with fresh cut and hand dipped onion rings that were amazing.  We also tried 1/2 dozen wings they were excellent as well this is is our third time and won't be our last"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous!! We had the Royal sandwich with potato salad, the meatball with onion rings and chicken wings with potato chips.  Everything was the best!!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The place has CLOSED THEIR DOORS. So bummed. Such a nice family and good food. We miss you!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  I got a foot long and 2 beef on whecks, one with frys one with onion rings, to go.  Everything traveled well and tasted great when I got home.  The grill inside the restraunt smells amazing! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very poor service the time to cook products was not acceptable.  The person did not communicate with the person's making the food.  I was 16, #24 received food prior to me. Management miss placed order..   Food was not good!  Old oil in the deep fryer and the Philly sandwich was not thin sliced.  The Only Thing IN Common Was Bell peppers.  Poorly run, poorly cooked. Avoid this place,."}
{"text":"Beef on weck is great. Good value for your  money.  It is truly authentic buffalo type eating."}
{"text":"Took my kids here today. Loved it. We ordered a hot dog, came out steaming and perfectly crisp, so yum. The wings were so delicious, loved the mild sauce, perfect for the kids. The cheeseburger was juicy and I loved the bun and crispy French fries! Super affordable, clean, friendly atmosphere and family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"If you're from Buffalo you're in for a treat!  Yummy!  Chips are FABULOUS!  Owners are great people.   Lunch or dinner,  try it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 hot wings, and an all beef hotdog. The girl asked me what kind of sauce for my wings, and I said I wanted hot sauce on my hot wings. Wings came out plain. I couldn't tell you if the hotdogs are any good because I didn't get that. I went up to get some sauce for wings and also asked why I didn't get my hotdog. The girl that took the order could not answer me for some odd reason. The guy behind the grill asked what kind of hotdog I ordered. I told him all beef. I really have no idea why he asked me that because he didn't make me one or offer a refund. I guess he just wanted to know what kind of hotdog I wanted, but didn't need? After spending $12 for 6 wings and a soda i left hungry and disappointed.  I had to go get a hamburger on the way home. I will never ever go back there again.  well a week and a half have gone by, and still no answer to why i never got my hotdog and no refund. shame on you taste of buffalo."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the food, drove all the way out to this place, but hours had been arbitrarily changed to \"summer hours\" (not mentioned in yelp) and the place was closed. BUMMER."}
{"text":"Subway has better sandwiches.   I paid  $22 for two mediocre sandwiches with skimpy meat and meh... bread.   How this place is rated so high is baffling.   If I were you I would go elsewhere. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"When we walked in to the smells of the grill we new it was going to be deliciois. The all beef hot dog is expertly grilled. We got a cheese steak, potatoe salad and all beef jot dogs. The cheese steak was full of flavor with a good balance of peppers,onions, cheese to meat ratio. The beef hot dog had a great char and the sauerkraut had a great balance of pepper and vinegar. The potatoe salad was delicious. We were happy to find out it was more mustard based rather than mayo"}
{"text":"Being from Buffalo NY originally I'm very picky when people claim to have \"Buffalo \" food on the menu! This place!!! Well they really deliver! The staff were all very friendly and accommodating!  The food is made there fresh! Aside from the Sahlen's hot dogs they have flown in! Yummy! All in all a delicious meal at a great price! So glad they are close by!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the are closed  small businesses are hard to keep afloat. It wad great while it lasted. Thanks for the Buffalo New York experience."}
{"text":"I wish I liked hotdogs.   Great new place in the hood. The folks working here are great!  I got the Chicken Parm sandwich which is huge and slathered in cheese. It comes with a side order choice between some salad choices and or house chips.  I ordered their house made chips which were okay. I do preface that though because I am very spoiled after eating the chips at  Market by Jennifer's. Those chips spoil you to all others. Lol   If you are form Upstate Ny stop by the digs are cool.   The prices are a bit spendy though. I will say I got two and I could have gotten three meals out of my sandwich."}
{"text":"Recently relocated to the Valley from WNY (i.e. Buffalo) we HAD to give this place a try, mainly because my husband wanted a Royal and Wings. I was hoping for Buffalo Chicken Fingers...they were still delicious, just not Buffalo Chicken Fingers. I'm sure we will return, if we don't make it back East for a while. The atmosphere definitely felt like home!"}
