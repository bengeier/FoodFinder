{"text":"Wanted a bread bowl of soup for $7. Sounded real good. After paying I was notified that there are no bread bowls today. I was offered a croissant instead. Small portion of soup was not very good (probably not made fresh) and I could hear the microwave heating it up from where I sat.  The croissant wasn't all that fresh and was also very small. Not good. Not going back."}
{"text":"Best chicken salad I ever had! It had pineapple and nuts and was simply amazing. The service was great and the store that is the front has great items. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and very hidden. We went there because of a Groupon they sent out to drum up some business, and it was so worth it. I had the Piggly Wiggly, and it was pretty good. Soups and brownies taste homemade. Overall, this place should have more business, even though it's really small. It's worth visiting."}
{"text":"The cafe is great!  The sandwiches are the kind mom made and loaded with all the fixings. They don't skimp at all!  Amazing customer service. Defiantly going to be a regular spot."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden, inside of Poppy's. But it's worth the hunt - great (and somewhat unique) sandwich selection. I highly recommend the Picadilly (turkey, cream cheese and cranberry sauce), and my boyfriend got the Pollywog (tuna with cucumbers and tomato) which he liked as well. This place also has ENORMOUS cupcakes, and the flavors they bake changes daily."}
