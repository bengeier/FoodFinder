{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, good service.  This is exactly what I want at the airport.  Perfect.  My only slight complaint is the price.  A club sandwich and a beer cost me $30."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever. They claim to be the 1st molecular cuisine restaurant in an airport in North America. Their dishes are fresh, tasty and excellent. Good service and good prices. You can walk across the hall and get deep fried whatever, or you can eat excellent food here. Given Pearson feels like my 2nd home (not a good thing) this place is a welcome addition to the food and lounge scene."}
{"text":"I didn't get to trying the food. I sat at the bar, and this is what happened: \"What are your beers on tap?\" \"Henderson and Goose Island.\" \"OK, which Goose Island beer is it?\" \"Goose Island. We also have Budweiser.\" \"Goose Island has multiple beers. Which of their beers is it?\" \"Goose Island. [pause.] Ale.\" \"Ah. Which of their ales?\" \"Ale. Not a lager. It's an ale. It looks amber.\"

This was not a language issue. And the other person behind the bar didn't volunteer any more information. I know, this isn't the brewpub across the hall. Still. This level of training did not inspire me. I left."}
{"text":"Excellent for airport food. Had a club sandwich and gin & tonic. A Little twist on everything.  Wish there were more choices like this in other airports."}
{"text":"In this wing of the airport there's not a lot to choose from when it comes to vegan options. I got a hummus platter at Bar 120 that had pita, cucumber and peppers. They also have fresh fruit trays, macro bars, K's NRG bars (which I believe is a local company) and a couple other grab and go snacks. Airport food is expensive and this wasn't really an exception. Choices are limited so better than nothing."}
{"text":"There's a number of good places to eat at Pearson airport, and this certainly counts as one of them. A molecular menu has been created, providing some tasty and familiar dishes with an interesting twist.  

The crispy fish tacos are one of our go-to dishes here, and while we must admit they are never particularly crispy, they are always very tasty.  The batter is fresh, flavourful and never greasy. They're served with a chipotle mayo and salsa gel - essentially creamy little jello cubes with a concentrated salsa flavour. All the taste with none of the mess!  

We recently also tried their grilled cheese stacks; the cheese and prosciutto sammies were nice, but not particularly memorable.  There was some cheddar cheese and prosciutto - but not much cheese and there was no indication that the bread was grilled. The mustard \"pipette\" (essentially a very light, foamed mousse) they were served with, however, deserve to be highlighted. It had an incredibly concentrated and rich flavour. The nice part is they're easy for sharing as they come on small baguette slices, so you get 4 mini sandwiches. 

You have to be a bit assertive with staff. They will not seat you, which leaves some people confused as there is no sign letting you know you can plop yourself down wherever you please, so just seat yourself. Also once you have sat down, it's probably a good idea to make sure they notice you're there. Otherwise, we've had good service."}
{"text":"All BS...
Cuisine Transformed? Not at all... I'm writing this review as I'm sitting at the table.
I try to order a signature Martini... but... no lemon caviar...
So, I ordered a gin & tonic, another signature drink. It was good. The highlight.
We ordered an antipasti. The crostini were stale, the salami poorly chosen, but the quince marmalade (that comes in a tube) was good.
The worst were the chicken tacos that don't come with the tomato salsa pearls anymore (something that they forgot to tell me until I asked about them). 
Overall, a very, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I don't understand how four people can be that oblivious to everything going on around them. Food is mediocre. Definitely nothing special. I keep having to beg somebody to take my order..."}
{"text":"Our flight left Columbus, OH so early, I didn't get a chance to eat a proper breakfast. Our connecting flight's gate was just down the way, so this place won by default. My waitress was nice and polite. My order for the Breakfast Sandwich got forwarded to the chef, and was out in no time. Baked red skin potato wedges were a bit squishy. The bread (a multigrain ciabatta) was soft and warm. More bread than meat fillings, but hey I've come to expect this in any airport restaurant setting: high pricing for typically average food. They did have a cooler area full of pre-made eats. Sandwiches, fruit, yogurt, soft drinks, etc. if you need something to grab and go, this place can manage that request."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, great service

we had three great plates :
chicken liver mousse 
salmon on toast 
and a caprese salad 

best airport food I've had in a long long long long time"}
{"text":"BAR:120 serves up mediocre food with inattentive service.

I stopped here for breakfast before my flight. The restaurant is open and spacious, with a few tables and some bar seating. The breakfast menu was small, but the items looked appealing. I decided to try the scrambled eggs.

Unfortunately, the eggs were quite bland. The accompanying toast was also soggy, and the onion and sweet pepper confit was slimy. The only redeeming factor was the bacon, which was actually quite good: nice flavor and the perfect texture that's not too crispy nor too soft.

The food came out very quickly (almost disconcertingly so), but then the waitress seemed to forget about me. It took forever to get my bill, even after asking multiple times. This was a bit frustrating, since I had a plane to go catch.

Overall a mediocre experience. Your options here in YYZ aren't great, but I think you can still do better than BAR:120."}
{"text":"Not the best airport food ever, but certainly decent. Chicken in our chicken tacos were not as substantial as we would have liked, but great spices to compensate."}
