{"text":"Great little place! Vermicelli bowl very flavorful! Very tasty salad rolls. Menu has good variety.Restaurant clean. Service prompt! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened up close to where my boyfriend and I live, and we were excited to try a new Vietnamese place. Well, let me just tell you all - this is a fantastic place! The owner is super friendly, and the food is so yummy. Subs are delicious (I always regret getting just one), and the deserts are also good - everything is super good! Besides this, you never have to wait long to get your food and we usually go in the afternoon, when it's a little on the busier side. Great customer service and great food!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and actually craving it right now! Both times I had the seafood sate soup because it was so good. Salad rolls are a must. Deep fried calamari was really good. My boyfriend had the chicken vermicelli with extra rolls the first time and beef sate rice dish with salad the second and I can tell you they were good too....cause of course I tried them. 

Overall, the food is delicious and the service is quick and friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot! Ordered the chicken vermicelli bowl and salad rolls, both were very tasty and fresh!! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In a funky unassuming HighWood strip mall sits the new Rau Bistro serving Authentic Vietnamese Street Food. My family has eaten here twice and love it. Quality fresh ingredients with a twist make this little hidden gem better than a lot of the boring middle of the road Vietnamese places in YYC. Chili-Mango Beef in mixed greens salad is probably the most innovative Viet-salad in this city. Fresh and crisp: kale, carrots, purple cabbage, radishes, fried shallots, peanuts, with a chili mango dressing drizzled over beef. Dish deelish ! Leaving me feeling super light yet full with zero regrets. The Bun Rice Vermicelli bowls are full of fresh veggies as well. Salt & Pepper Tofu w/side salad is also unique. Give em a shot ! I'd hate to see such a great little place not get the love they deserve from the local community here in the culinary void of HighWood ! Great prices, quick service, friendly owners, fresh ingredients what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I had never had pho before in my life until I moved to Calgary, I fell in love with it so I have tried most places in the city.. all I have to say is this is the best pho hands down,, all the food is amazing I have shown or told most my friends and it's now their place to go too. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"My MIL suggested this place to try after reading about it in the food section of the newspaper. I'm always up for trying new places. We came on a Saturday at 5pm, it was not busy at all and was able to call ahead to make a reservation just in case. The waitress was super friendly and asked if we have been there before, as we haven't  gave us time to look over the menu and answered our questions. Once you are ready to order, you go to the counter to place your order. Once the food is ready they will bring it to your table. We started with the lettuce wrapped spring rolls and salt and pepper calamari. Both was super delicious- the spring rolls were made with rice paper and came out hot, crispy and flavourful and the calamari was nicely battered and the dipping sauce paired great with it. I got the beef, chicken and shrimp vermicelli and added a spring roll with it since it didn't come with it.  I really enjoyed everything and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best Vietnamese food in the city!! Our family has gotten takeout from here at least a dozen times. The food is always very fresh & delicious !! 

My favorite is the vegetarian vermicelli bowl-soft & crispy tofu, thin warm noodles, veggies & fried spring rolls. You can also order fresh juices; carrot, apple & ginger.

Staff is always very kind, friendly & accommodating. Takeout is usually very fast. They're also on Skip The Dishes for easy ordering on your phone.

There's a kids menu too; smaller portions & great prices!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Clean, fresh, just right.

My wife and I had the beef satay soup with spring rolls.  Both were excellent.  The soup had a great flavour, maybe my mind is playing tricks on me but it has a small star anise smell and flavour but just the right amount not making it over powering.

The soup itself has a really nice latent heat that's not too in your face and doesn't make your mouth scream.  

Spring rolls were great, everything was fresh and right on par.  

I'd suggest you check this place out, I seriously doubt you will regret it."}
{"text":"The best vermicelli in Calgary! (Noodles, meat and veggies are all so fresh) Go here at least once a week  also, the best spring rolls! Everything else I've ever ordered has been super tasty as well."}
{"text":"Rau is a nice hidden gem of a Vietnamese restaurant. I've been here about 3-4 times and every dish I've tried so far has been delicious. If you're looking for some unique takes on your traditional Pho and Bun this is the place to go. Their Pho broth is full of flavour. You can smell and taste all the traditional spices used while they simmered the broth which is sadly a rarity with most Pho places. Their various Bun dishes are also full of flavour, and I would recommend trying their homemade grilled sausage (they also make their own bread for their Banh Mi). Don't forget to take advantage of their weekly specials of 10% off their Bun (vermicelli noodle) dishes on Wednesdays or free spring roll with Pho on Mondays. Can't wait to trying the remainder of their menu items :). 

SIDE NOTE: for all you environmentally conscious people, you'll be happy to know all their take out containers are earth friendly and recyclable!"}
{"text":"This place impressed me at the first time I came. I will recommend their pho with satay, but it's not their best stuff. Their green papaya salad is so good and fresh, which is a perfect starter for the coming summer. I like their sub3 (with grilled beef and roasted pineapple). It tastes so good with the pineapple in it. The service is good too. The menu is hand-written on the blackboard. Everything looks good here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Foods are really fresh and tasty.  The Vietnamese classic sub is the best in town, the beef sub is a specialty that no place has it.  Love all the grill meats (beef, chicken, pork), the chicken wings are so crispy and delicious. Services are friendly and fresh. Been here a few times and will come back more often."}
{"text":"Rau provides a slight twist to Vietnamese dishes you might find throughout Canadian Vietnamese restaurants. Whether it be the pickled vegetable accompaniment that comes with many of its offerings, or inclusion of more hard-to-come by la lop elements that are more commonly found in more \"ethnic\" Vietnamese restaurants, you will not be disappointed. I would seek this place out if I am in the neighbourhood again. The meals are tasty and comforting!"}
{"text":"Great place for casual pho. I always look for a quick, simple, yet tasty place that utilizes fresh ingredients. The Pho base soup is clean, has a aniseed note and does not leave a dry aftertaste in the mouth. Noodles have a firm texture that does not break apart in the soup. Additionally, the freshness of the basil and bean sprouts is important to the texture of the overall noodle soup--and they do provide the quality of freshness. Not to mention, the prices are cheap."}
{"text":"Love the papaya salad here!  Very reasonable prices.  Bread for subs are freshly made in the restaurant.  One of the very few restaurants who make their own bread.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I`ve been meaning to go to Rau for a long time. The reviews here are stellar. That`s why I was surprised I didn't like this place more than I did. My friends each ordered something different and loved their dish. One raved about her bun and sub, and she knows her Vietnamese food, so perhaps it was just my bowl.

I ordered the chicken bun. The chicken was really dry, hard and tasteless. The spring rolls were nice and light, it tasted like Rau used rice paper. Together, the meat and spring rolls didn`t have much flavour. It would have been nice if the vegetables were pickled or had more zest.

The beef sub was really tasty, particularly the grilled beef which was tender and had a great sauce on it. I tried the sub with pineapple, which was different and delicious. The bread is made in house. 

My friends vouched for the seafood mix bun and the beef bun. The portions aren`t big but the prices seem reasonable for the care put into each dish. I`ll have to return and try some other dishes and update this review."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and saw the rave reviews for this place so I decided to give it a try. 

The place is located in a strip mall off of 4th street. There is usually plenty of parking in the strip mall, which I love, because I hate struggling to find parking. The restaurant itself is of a decent size, but the system is more like fast food, where you order at the counter and sit down at the table and wait for your food.

I have tried multiple dishes here including the papaya salad (my fav!), pho, viet subs, and the wrap and roll dish where you make your own salad rolls.

I found the flavours of all the dishes quite good, and close to being very authentic. The only reason I took off one star was because I found the prices a little expensive, compared to most Vietnamese restaurants, and portions not as large as I had hoped for the price.

The service is minimal as they only really help you at the counter, but still friendly, and I did not have an issue when I was picking up take out. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out the place if you are nearby for Viet food. I have visited a handful of times, but find myself taking the time to drive an extra 15min to the NE for cheaper Viet food though."}
{"text":"Tasty Vietnamese food, really enjoyed the spring roll vermicelli.  The spring rolls were very flavourful and tastier compared to the many, many Vietnamese food places I have tried over the years.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Menu is just right. I had sub and it was awesome and my guest had a vermicelli bowl and said it was great!  Small hole in the wall place but clean, courteous and great food!  What else do you want?  Oh yea, the prices are very reasonable.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the Satay Beef sandwich with pineapple and the 3 meat Pho. It was absolutely delicious, and the staff are so friendly. We are now regulars!"}
{"text":"We've tried the veggie spring rolls and the veggie noodle soup.  They were both delicious. We will definitely be back for these dishes.  We went here on the Friday that John Gilchrist's article came out.  They were starting to get very busy. You should go before everyone finds out about this hidden gem.

They also have a very delicious pho that is gluten free (no msg for the extra sensitive folks). You just have to let them know and they'll let you know what items they can make gluten free."}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp specifically to write a review for this new hidden gem! I have been here a handful of times and every dish I have tried has been amazing and full of flavour.

The Ban Mi subs are the best I have had in the city.  The baguettes are super fresh and the homemade meatballs are to die for.  The beef and roasted pineapple is such a great twist on the classic fillings.

The rice vermicelli bowls are a good sized portion and have so many great options for toppings.

I wanted to write this review because this place is so great and I would love to watch this restaurant succeed.

The ladies that work there are truly gracious and kind and always go the extra mile for their guests.

I look forward stopping in here as often as possible and working my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a gf and we both ordered the vegetarian spring rolls with salt n pepper tofu on vermicelli. Loved it!!! The ingredients are fresh and well portioned. 

Rather than the usual fish sauce, they provide a dark soy sauce for the noodles which was tasty. The thing that set it apart from many other Vietnamese restos is the noodle itself.  So soft and fresh not hard or dried out.  Will definitely return to try more items!!! 

How it works? You order at the counter, pay and choose a seat. They'll bring your food when it's ready to be served.  Our bowl with tax came to $11."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, finally found traditional vietnamese spring rolls in Calgary (after a few of my fave places closed down). Always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food right here in Highwood & Highland Park. The beef slices in the Pho were exceptionally tender. Very flavourful pork on a fresh sub. And very friendly! Highly recommended!"}
