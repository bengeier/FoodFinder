{"text":"Met a friend for dinner. The restaurant has an open feel I really liked. I had the fish and chips, loved the chips, the fish was nicely cooked, my friend had ribs, he loved them. The food is nicely presented the service was excellent. I would easily recomment Keegans to my friends and am looking forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"The ribs are the best in town. Service is friendly and efficient. It's a neighborhood place that's been there for years. Love going, happy hour 2x a day!"}
{"text":"terrible experience.........have been patron for 25 years.......never again..........service non existent,  food took almost 1 hour and only came after i spoke with manager..........water glasses empty....... 3 adjacent tables, who arrived 15/30 minutes later than us,  were all served and we waited......when this was mentioned to manager he said, \" your meals must have been more complicated to prepare\"........at  least that was funny 2 fish and chips, 1 cobb salad, and 1 salmon filet..........salmon extremely over cooked and vegetables were inedible..........my meal (fish and chips was returned to manager untouched and salmon was returned after one bite we were not charged for uneaten food.......however no adjustment  or compensation was made for the inconvenience or embarrassment.......i was told to return all four meals and pay for the drinks and that was that...... the ladies ate we paid the bill but we will not return........what a disaster........too many good restaurants in phoenix who offer better food and service..........general information this is the first time i have ever yelped...........neighboring patron enlightened me ( they were also dissatisfied)"}
{"text":"Enjoy the meatloaf (usually Monday) and chicken fried steak (usually Tuesday) specials. I have tried all of the fruit cobblers and enjoy all of them. I have been going to Keegan's (on and off) since 1996.  I recently tried the cupcake with ice cream. It was good but I still prefer the fruit cobblers. The fruit cobblers change almost daily so try them all!"}
{"text":"I placed a \"to go\" order tonight with Erica & I left the call feeling like I had made a friend. Their website/menu was down & she took the time to give me options based on what I was craving. Their prices are more than reasonable for the service and taste! We will DEFINITELY be going back! THANK YOU ERICA!!!!!"}
{"text":"After moving away from Phoenix a few years ago I finally had the chance to revisit for business travel. I knew exactly what stops I wanted to make while I was there and Keegan's, hit the top of that list! A girlfriend of mine was able to meet me for lunch and as we walked in the door I was blown away by the recent renovations they went through, the place looks awesome! Although the place was different looking I was still greeted by some of the same employees that I remember! Ramsey, the manager was working and he also made a stop of at our table to say hello (this is the kind of service Keegan's is known for) friendly, energetic people who are always smiling.   For lunch I had the Cobb salad; chicken, hard boiled egg, smoked gouda cheese, bleu cheese, bacon and avocado with your choice of dressing (and if you ask they will toss it for you)....seriously so good... heaven in my mouth!! My friend got the Taproom Steak Sandwich, perfectly cooked to her liking and she said it was awesome! And since I was on vacation (well sorta!) we decided to wash our delicious meals down with one of Keegan's famous Mud Pies!! YUMMY!!  I wish I still lived close, I'd visit Keegan's every week if I could. I should be traveling to Phoenix again soon and when I do I will definetly be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"Keegan's is in my neighborhood and I have driven past it many many times and surprisingly have never eaten here.  Went in today for breakfast around 10:30 and it was not the best experience, the food was OK  but I highly doubt I will go back.  First off the hostess seemed to be sick, she had the sniffles and literally said \"sorry, I'm still asleep,\" as she sat us down. Then she set our table and touched every single part of our utensils with her unwashed hands.  After she had been yawning, sniffling and touching the door and menus.  I'm not a big germa-phone but this is not very appealing as I'm about to eat.  Then our waitress came along and was not familiar with the menu at all.   She was still friendly and attentive, but overall not the greatest experience.   Next time I think we'll try Noca next door."}
{"text":"Not bad. Happy Hour is at the bar and patio ONLY.  Lots of regulars, but friendly. Get here early if you want to sit at the bar.  Potato skins were an awesome choice. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service.  A neighborhood gem!  Great place for hanging out at the bar to have lunch and watch a game.  Very friendly servers and great food.  Wonderful French Dip sandwich and nice salads.  Has great charm and personality!"}
{"text":"I have been going here, to this location since 2005. The food is OK, some dishes better than others. None are bad. I usually get the special for dinner and a Black and Tan for the drink. Over all the service is a hit or a miss. Some times I get great service, other times it is very lacking. So they get three stars for that. The beer and drink selection is good. I have never had bad service at the bar. It is a good place go to watch a game on TV and have a few beers. I will be back because the food is consistently OK."}
{"text":"My new favorite restuarant/bar as it is a relaxing hangout.  Great food at great prices.  Staff is always good and they keep your drinks full.  There tuna sandwich is awesome.  The fries are not greasy at all.  I wish I would have discovered this place a long time ago."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour spot. Great American food with cheap prices. the baby back ribs ($6) were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Did I mention happy he starts at 2 pm!"}
{"text":"Not sure about anything other than Dee is the most personable and attentive server/bartender on earth. Service here is awesome and the Tai Cobb Salad is off the charts. I can't speak for anything other than that as I believe I've order it about 75 times and something else about twice. If you like salmon and salad, go here and get the above-mentioned salad during lunch. Your afternoon will be better for it!"}
{"text":"I think this is a pretty solid four star place. I visited with my parents yesterday for a birthday lunch. They have a patio that seemed pretty popular, but we chose to eat inside. The atmosphere inside is solid. Lighting was soothing and volume was just right on tv's.   The food was amazing.  We had the calihan cobb, the chicken sandwhich, and the pan am salad. Solid flavors and textures all around.   The only issue we had was the wait time for our food. It was 30-45 minutes for lunch. That's pushing it in our opinions for mid-day meal around 1:00 pm."}
{"text":"Love the new look of this place! Excellent craft beer on tap with a ton of different styles- some that I've never even heard of before. The chorizo con queso with flour chips is one of my fave appetizers. Dry-rubbed wings are super flavorful and unique! Staff was friendly and welcoming. :)  Also, the cobbler is delish- the server told me the flavors change pretty regularly!"}
{"text":"Not typical 'bar food' Good patio and service always good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is typical of other chain restaurants...nice and clean but nothing special. Food was so so. Our party ordered the \"spicy\" chicken wings as an appetizer but no one tasted anything remotely close to \"spicy\". I had the fish and chips...the batter was good and the fish moist, well prepared. Service was a bit slow, considering they were not busy at all when we were there."}
{"text":"I have been to Keegan's many times. The service is always very good. The food is excellent. The steak sandwich is one of my favorites. Not a typical bar and grill but a little more upscale. The atmosphere is more refined and the crowd tends to be a little older and more sophisticated."}
{"text":"Food was just rewarmed, then served.  Even the Cteme Brule was served cold.   Usually the top is freshly browned.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Keegan's is a nice pub style place with tv's placed perfectly for sports watching.  Our service was attentive and friendly and they have a nice selection of beers in the bottle and on draft.   The crowd is friendly and unpretentious.   The food, however, is just decent.  The spinach artichoke dip was runny and the chips served with it could have been crispier.  The fish and chips were good and didn't leave us disappointed.  Between the appetizer and the fish and chips, we were full.  I'll be back again, but more for the overall experience not so much the food."}
{"text":"Love Keegans, Staff are always so wonderful and the food is amazing and soo fresh never frozen franchise garbage! Love it for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Well at Keegan's you get a mixed bag. If all the stars align this place is great for a quick dinner out. However it can go bad quickly. I have been here many many times and over all if you come on off hours the happy hour is great and so is the food. When they are busy all hell breaks loose. Food take forever, service almost comes to a halt and it just seems to come unglued. I will say give  it a try just hope it's not one of those nights  LOL."}
{"text":"Keegan's has consistently good food. Their service is almost always top of the line, too. I usually eat here several times a month for lunch. The service is always friendly. The food is always good. They cycle through different daily specials, so if trying new things is your thing, there is always something different on the menu. If you like beer (I'm not much of a beer person), they also have multiple different ones they change out routinely almost with the common ones they keep all the time. They also have a nice patio with a fire pit and heat lamps if you like outside dining."}
{"text":"Lighting is low dim which adds to a relaxing atmospere. Temp is comfortable as well as the seats. Food is delicious. First time here. I order the house salad with chicken and oil and basimic vinegar dressing. Was delicious. They also have delicious drinks like keylime pie. Excellent waitress and very clean. Music is okay. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here and I eat here a LOT. it's much better than bar food. Prices are very reasonable and they have a $6.95 soup and sandwich every weekday for lunch."}
{"text":"This was our first and LAST trip here. Two couples went.  One person had a hair in her hamburger.  The other two burgers were undercooked.   The fourth person's fish was mediocre. The manager and waitress offered no \"real\" apologies or compensation."}
{"text":"First Yelp review...Keegan's was within walking distance so we checked it out for happy hour. The beer was flat, however the bartender switched it so that was decent. We had the grilled wings which were more charred than grilled. The sliders were alright.  The bad experience is probably my fault as they are apparently known for their specialty burgers.  Side note, what's a Taproom? they only had about 5 beers on tap?"}
{"text":"There was time in my life that I was at Keegan's at least once or twice a week (don't judge me!) and here's the scoop on what you should order:  Sliders and a Stella. They have prime rib sliders, with a zesty horse radish Dijon mix that's outstanding.  Look at the menu board, but Thursday nights should be Yankee Pot Roast night.   Potato Skins. Big plate and good enough to share."}
{"text":"They have the BEST wings...not fried! They now offer grass fed and hormone free burger...YUM!"}
{"text":"Worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life!!! Kinda feels like a retirement home."}
{"text":"Food is good, portions are small.  Hostess and servers have bad attitudes. If you're not a regular customer in their bar area, you will be ignored by them. Management should be more aware of this, but never seem to be around or weren't interested in addressing this."}
{"text":"Keegan's is a great local bar. Close to home and very friendly staff. Great beer on tap. The only downfall is that it is hard to find parking during peak hours. I appreciated that they took reservations during a busy time for a game they were showing on TV."}
{"text":"\"Well we've taken care of your dinner.\" Your right sir. That's because I never ate it.  My experience this evening sitting at Keegan's Grill was abysmal. We were excited about trying this local restaurant.  When we arrived I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin.  Service was quick and our server was sweet. However, when I received my dish the pork was raw. I called the server over she took it back to the kitchen right away. Unfortunately, when the kitchen refired it they brought back the exact same dish. The previous raw tenderloins that I had cut into were dry and the sides that I had previously cut into were sent back to me as well.  I called the server back over and sent the dish back. I thought it was quite unacceptable that my same dish was sent back to me.  The manager came over to discuss the situation after the fact and simply stated, \"Well we've taken care of your dinner.\" No mention of replacing my dish was discussed or of how he as a manager if this Keegan's location could rectify the situation. And sir, you are correct that you shouldn't charge me for an inedible dish, especially one that was sent back.....TWICE. Unfortunately, due to management's failure to handle the situation appropriately and the kitchen's failure to cook meat to the correct temperature I will not be back to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Not great. Very empty at dinner time on a Thursday. Odd crowd and wait staff seemed uninterested in our table. Food was pretty meh, will not return"}
{"text":"This review is a little outdated but I'm playing catch-up and wanted to include this.  We've passed this place a bunch and decided to go try it out for dinner one night.  I ordered a balsamic vinegar salmon and when it was delivered I could smell it was off (and the chef didn't?).  I tried a small bite to be sure, and yup, it was off.  I told the waiter and, get this, he tried to tell me that can happen when you put balsamic vinegar on fish.  Seriously? First off, no, it doesn't.  Secondly, if it did, why would you offer it? Third, WHO CARES!?!?!? It's bad.  Say you're sorry, take it back, offer something up, whatever.  Then it took the manager to come over and I had to explain that the fish was bad and they tried to offer me something else.  Let's see, I just had a plate of bad fish delivered to me and the smell is still in my nostrils. Yeah, ya know what, can I have some chicken?  Rare if you don't mind, so we can keep with the theme.  Knotheads.    I have to assume it was just a bad experience for me, as they are still there, and I see some good reviews, but I won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in about a year. Now I remember why. Food is nothing special. They used to have really good carne asada tacos and pork medallions on menu over a year ago. Have tried a few menu items since then and always a bit disappointing.  I like the ambience and the staff are always friendly.  Won't be back anytime soon because the food is not that good,  unfortunately.  They need new food items on the menu."}
{"text":"Was here on oct 7. Ordered fish and chips. Very greasy and an area of the fish was very hard. Could not cut thru it. What was it? Maybe a tumor?  The crust separated from the fish and was not pleasant to eat. The menu said it was panko crusted but did not seem to be to me. The cole slaw and tartar sauce were good. Had not been here in quite a while and most likely will not return soon. My daughter had the nightly special orange roughy and did like it."}
{"text":"I had been thinking about my Mom all morning and decided to have lunch at Keegan's.  It would be the 21st Birthday Lunch we would have shared together  (Her birthday on April 28th and mine In May.  This would be my first dining alone at a Keegan's Birthday Lunch without her.  I arrived at Keegan's about 12:30 for lunch.  While waiting to be seated I saw that our latest favorite,  Fish Tacos, was featured on the menu board.  It was Friday, 4/28, I was thrilled at seeing it ... a great beginning for our lunch.  The hostess showed me to a table with a sunny smile, a window view.  When my server asked me if I would like something to drink I asked if they had a sparkling water.  She smiled and named Perrier.  \"That's great\", I said,  then got an idea to order 2 glasses.  She asked if someone would be joining me.  I chuckled and told her no then changed my request to two wine glasses with an explanation that it was a Birthday Celebration.  She smiled and said, ..\"Sure, would you like Ice?\" \"No, but  I do already know what I'm going to order\".  She seemed surprised, but I had seen the Taco special and that's what I ordered.  When the Perrier came with the two wine glasses I opened the bottle and poured it into both glasses happy that they looked so sparkly.  I raised my glass clinking the other toasting our birthdays.  The fish tacos came with a smiling server.   It was so festive I took a picture.  Throughout the meal my server politely came by to ask about my meal.  It couldn't have been better.   Again, she asked if there was anything she could get me.  I thanked her no it's just perfect.  So l thought...until my meal was finished. To my surprise a beautifully whipped cream topped chocolaty desert with a lit candle arrived with a  cheerful \"Happy Birthday!\" greeting.  My face must have lit up like a child on Christmas morning.  I was so surprised.  I took another picture before I began enjoying....Delicious!!   As I finished the check was set on the table's corner.   I inserted my credit card into the slot and set the folder down. The server came by, picked up the check folder took my card out and handed it to me.  She smiled kindly explaining that she and the hostess decided to buy my lunch. She cheerfully said, \"We don't think anyone should buy their birthday lunch\".  I was so overcome with emotion I burst into tears.  I wasn't aware or composed enough to even ask their names or explain the celebration.  My mom had eaten at Keegan's very often since it opened in 1989 and when her family visited we would eat at Keegan's with her.   We've seen exciting changes and always feel the warm welcoming atmosphere and enjoy the delicious menu.   Everyone in our family has eaten at Keegan's.  Last year we had a family farewell dinner at Keegan's to celebrate mom when she passed.    In 1996  I began flying down every year from Seattle to be with her for her 4/28 birthday's.   My birthday is in May so we celebrated both our birthdays on her day every year at Keegans.  We enjoyed it and took turns treating one another.   I decided to continue our tradition with so many memories to celebrate.  The experience confirmed there are Angels among us.  When two Angels shared their hearts with me it was a message of kindness, goodness and a confirmation to me.  \"All is well with my soul\".  You were unaware of our journey and certainly didn't know it was my mom's turn to treat.  I was touched and am so grateful to have received this gift and will honor it by sharing it with others.  Thank you for your exceptional kindness.  Karen and Marion"}
{"text":"We have thoroughly enjoyed Keegans new remodel and menu!  How fabulous to be able to order two fantastic meals, each $11.00!!  The service has greatly improved and we try to get in at least once a week!  Check out their ribs... you will NOT be sorry!"}
{"text":"One-Visiting from Austin,TX.  This might imply that I like my food on the spicy side so my review should be taken with a grain of salt.  Two-the online menu sounds fantastic. Reasonably priced,  and somewhat regionally sourced food.  Three-Which came first?  The chicken or the egg?  Or in relation to Keegan's, the geriatric clients who pay the bills and fill the restaurant OR the menu items which start out sounding so promising and end up being bland, bland, bland which caters to the existing clientele.    I tried the fish and chips, with a beer sampler.  It's usually pretty hard to screw up.  The slaw consisted of fresh cut cabbage and other vegetables smothered in 99% mayo.  No sweetness of pickles or relish to counteract the creaminess of the mayo. The panko breaded fish was well prepared, but boring. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, and tasteless.  Frozen fish sticks have more flavor.   My wife had the natural sourced burger, overcooked to medium well, served without mustard or mayo, not even on the side.  Both dishes came with fries, nicely cooked, but then over salted at the end.  Keegan's is a comfy, well staffed, restaurant serving safe standards cooked safely.  Your parents will love it."}
{"text":"I normally love Keegans.   I especially love the Keegans on Ray and 48th street; great food and service!!! I just recently heard about the Camelback location's remodel. I had previously been there and it needed a face lift. Tonight I went in with ym family. The atmosphere looks amazing... Great job with the remodel! However, I had really a really poor experience. My dad arrived first and a male server came over to greet him (he ordered a beer and water). Then I arrived... No one came over for like 10 minutes. Then my mom arrived and still no one for about another 5-8 minutes. I flagged down another server and told her we needed our server. She looked at me all shocked, and said \"Oh, ok Ill try and find who it is\". Not a very professional response. Anyway, we finally get another girl, who was very sweet, and she said she'd be helping us. As she was getting our drinks the male server finally returned, didn't address us, but asked our \"new server\" to just take the table and passed her my dad's beer... Really unprofessional. We ended up having great service with our new server. The only other thing that bothered me, was that I ordered the taproom steak sandwich. I have had this several times over the years at all 3 locations. Tonight I got it and it looked like half the normal portion! What happened Keegan's did we skim back? It was literally 2 small steaks (maybe 1.5lbs each instead of the normal 3lbs each). I just think that's really skimpy for a $14 dollar meal. I hope this is helpful criticism because I do love the Keegan's restaurants and normally have good service. I was just really disappointed tonight and thought you needed to know!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is fresh and high quality.  For as good as the food is, the prices are great!  Highly reccommend if you have never been!"}
{"text":"Just went to Keegan's for the second time. Had the fish and chips. They were great!!!! Not greasy like other places, will absolutely have them again. The coleslaw was the best I have had in a very long time.  Most restaurants have no Idea how to make it.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We will return again and recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time before I shop next door at Safeway. Love their salmon salad and they have the best french dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok...Gave Keegans another try..and Kaboom..Stella is back...Not on tap mind you...but in a bottle. Yea....Also had the Carnitas Potato skins and they were unbelievable.  Really good. Only $7 on the happy hour menu!   I am Back!!!!"}
{"text":"Best beer selection in the valley and even better food. Happy hour 2-630 and 8-close. The food is consistently good here unlike many other restaurants in the area. The food servers are polite and very attentive. Definitely my favorite restaurant in chandler."}
{"text":"A geat place for a comfort meal, from hamburgers to steaks, and prices are very reasonable. We always bring friends who like it too."}
{"text":"Keegan's has become our favorite east valley restaurant.  Great food at reasonable prices with exceptional service...what more could you ask!  The Artisan French Dip is my favorite while my wife loves any of Keegan's daily dinner specials, especially the chicken fried steak.  It's obvious the owners of this business are experienced, knowledgeable restaurateurs...the place is ALWAYS busy."}
{"text":"Just came here for lunch and had a great experience. Anastasia was our server, she was very nice and you could tell she cared about providing us great service! Amazing food, good music and vibe! 5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for ribs and steak but it wasn't dinner hour. I had wings and sandwiches instead and they were still great. I love the environment"}
{"text":"I have been in love with Keegan's since the moment we moved here two years ago and Keegan's was the first local restaurant my family tried!  Their potato skins are to die for - best I've had anywhere quite frankly.  The jalapeño burgers are excellent too!  Happy hour menus are awesome and the staff is super friendly!  One time we accidentally double paid and the waitress saved the extra money for us and gave it back, which was supercool because we didn't even know we double paid!"}
{"text":"All in all a good solid casual uptown bar. The waitresses were friendly and beautiful, the bartender is skilled/attentive and the mixed drinks on the menu uses some of the better quality whiskey/vodka/tequila at a truly reasonable price.  I had the turkey burger on the recommendation of another reviewer and while it was indeed good, it was a pre-formed patty so nothing spectacular. The sweet potato fries were good, the Kentucky mule was very good, and the waitresses preemptively setup a second table outside (away from the other customers) for an after dinner cigar.  A restaurant/bar that treats it's patrons this well is a good find, one that is friendly to the occasional cigar loving patron is a rare find. I'll be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Sunday am brunch with 2 dogs. Comfy outdoor seating area. No wait. Food was good, frittata and nice crunchy little potatoes and really good cheddar biscuits. Great service too! I look forward to trying the dinner specials,"}
{"text":"Keegan's is consistently good. I visit three or four times a month and am never disappointed. I especially appreciate that they keep their web site current, listing daily specials. It often attracts me, like today when I read the half sandwich and soup special -- chile verde soup and grilled bacon and cheese sandwich. Sit at the bar with Dee and you will have you in and out in 30 minutes even on a busy day if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Opted for large size Dinner salad...very very very good. Service was incredibly slow to the point that we had get up from the table to order and get our check.  Recommend waitress are either retrained on providing good expedite service or Management needs to be trained on making sure their waitress and waiters are providing exceptional service."}
{"text":"Top steak Sandwich was great.  Chicken wings were pretty tasteless.  Margarita served in small shot glass with ice cost 7.95."}
{"text":"Poor quality food.  Ordered the roast beef and I am pretty sure it was deli meat from a grocery store. We had the Keegan's shrimp tacos which were poor quality and tortilla was extremely dry.  Very disappointing and definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'll have to admit that I hadn't been here in a few months and live close by.  Boy was I missing out! Love their happy hour hours and their appetizers!  We had came for dinner but once we saw all of the new craft beers they had to offer, we decided to do the happy hour.  Great service, great food and a great place to hang out in Chandler.  Next time my family and I will definetly be going in for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today for the first time and was very impressed! The inside was decorated very cute for the holidays and it was surprisingly busy inside! We got the potato skins to share first and they were delicious, the chipotle sour cream definitely made that dish! We both got the cheeseburgers and they were some of the best ones we've ever eaten! I wish they had some different dessert options though. We will definitely be back again and would also love to try there dinner menu!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 10 and we were seated right away. Our server Jaime M was very attentive,  helpful,  and nice!  Jaime offered menu insights to make sure everyone would be happy with their orders.. All if the food was excellent. I had the all natural half chicken.  Chicken was well seasoned, and skin was crisp. Fries were wonderfully salty and perfectly cooked. Ribs were moist, eith a nice crust on the outside, not too sweat...most excellent."}
{"text":"Never write reviews but felt compelled this time. Haven't been to KEEGAN'S in awhile. Had a craving for ribs, decided to try the restaurant again. Food was delicious, however ribs were brought out cold. Had to send them back. Hostess was spunky as a wet noodle. Double charged for soft drinks, had to get that corrected. Probably won't go back for a while"}
{"text":"We had a large, high maintenance party of 20 in the private room. It was a perfectly casual outing for our large group and the private space helped to keep the event intimate even though it was a busy night at the Grill. The service was prompt and the drinks and food delivered efficiently and timely. The food was excellent. I had the filet cooked rare which came out perfect and deliciously tender and full of flavor. My boyfriend had the basil chicken which was juicy and full of flavor and my brother had the shrimp tacos which he also enjoyed. The kids meals were great sized portions and the server offered to bring them out ahead of the full meal service which turned out to be excellent foresight :) Overall a very good experience and I would highly recommend this joint to other largish parties and for any casual dinner (get the filet)!"}
{"text":"We came here with with a group and reserved their room for large parties.  Reservations were simple to make.  When everyone got there, service was outstanding even though vwe were isolated from the rest of the restaurant. Lots of selections on the menu and the food was outstanding.  Well done. A great night."}
{"text":"I eat here or order in whenever I visit my family who live out in Phoenix.  They have tasty American food, competent staff and a great selection of alcohol for beer or wine lovers.  Their steak sandwich is excellent as is their ceasar salad and fries.  I would say their only downsides are that their prices felt a bit high for the portions that they offer and the dining atmosphere is only okay.  But, if you want a good American meal eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there."}
{"text":"We had one horrible experience which was bad enough that I will not be returning. We went to lunch for a friends birthday. It wasn't busy when we went in & it took a while to get a waitress to take our order. We decided on the two salmon salads & both were horrible. For the amount of time it took to get the food, we were expecting something really tasty! ... No such luck. The salmon tasted weird & was way overcooked ... Completely charred.  We talked to the manager as a result of our bad meals & were offered a complementary dessert to make up for it. Knowing how long it took to place our order, to get our order, & the quality of the food, we should've known better. We thought we would give them a chance & get the Heathbar Mud Pie. At this point, we literally thought we were being punk'd. The ice-cream was really icy, the crunchy things were rock hard, etc. Don't even get me started on the amount of time it took us to get the check .. Thankfully, we just left cash to cover the bill & left! We were not pleased at all."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed myself! We went here for dinner and a drinky. Tuesday special is chicken fried steak. It was pretty good, 8 out of 10. Reverse happy hour starts at 8. Half off appetizers and dollar off drafts. Had a house merlot for 2.50 that was pretty dlish. I will definitely be back here!  Happy hour starts at 8 PM... Awesome! Food is Awesome! My new favorite place! Go there...NOW!"}
{"text":"I snuck in here on late evening before going out. I ordered off the HH menu. I wasn't overly impressed or disappointed.  The bar was packed with late 40's and 50 yr olds which seemed kind of weird to me. Don't get me wrong, party on, I encourage it. It was just weird having 35 middle aged folks partying at the bar on a Wednesday night and my girlfriend and I being the only ones sitting at the tables."}
{"text":"Was here 10/11/14  The service has improved and the food was good.  I could not see the kitchen from where we sat.  Server was attentive and checked on us several times.  Love the fish and chips!!  Not a fan of any of the salads.  Stopped getting them because they are over dressed and just don't taste good.  Keep working to make this better.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Been a very satisfied customer for 25 years! Autumn makes the best drinks! We've been spoiled by their potato skins, can't eat them anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went to Keegan's a couple of weeks ago and have been here before and liked the food. The last time I ordered the Asian Salad and I was disappointed.  There was nothing but lettuce, very little chicken and what was there was sliced so thin I could barely tell that it was chicken. There was two little tortilla strips and the rest of it was lettuce and very little dressing.  If I had been by myself I would have complain to the server and ask for something else since I had two bites and realized that it was not good.  Paying  $9 for a pile of lettuce is a rip off."}
{"text":"Service was good, quotes on wall were awesome!  Food was ok.  Presentation was great but food was not as good as it looked."}
{"text":"Great little spot for some small plates & apps. We stopped in for our Friday Date Night & had some small plates, the mezze/hummus plate was delicious but we sent back the mussels..pass on the mussells, but grab some sliders and everything else was delish! Great reverse HH as well!"}
{"text":"customer service is awesome when Autumn is working the bar. Down to earth place, low key, good place to hang out and have a drink."}
{"text":"This place is on point! I have the Schniders Sausage Bolognese and pasta and it was fantastic!  The service was fast and friendly, price to portion was good, and the drink selection was very nice.  I have been here on and off over the years and have not been disappointed yet! Worth a stop in you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous restaurant in Chandler.  It has a patio, bar with several TV screens tuned to sports, and a large set of booths for the anyone who wants.  The service was rapid and friendly by pretty waitresses.  I had a spicy salad one night and grilled salmon on another.  Both had unusual ingredients like toasted corn and were delicious and a great portion size for me.  I will definitely return to this grille for the bar and the rest of the menu.  It seemed like a good place to have a party on the patio, an intimate evening with a date, and anything else.  The music was loud enough to enjoy, but much quieter than most places with a sports bar in them."}
{"text":"The food was really bad.   And my son didn't touch his Cuz it was that yucky.   The waitress wasn't that friendly and didn't bother asking us if we wanted to try something else.  Since we barely ate any of it.   Good customer service is offering something else or at least a deduction for uneaten meals.   Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is simply one of my favorite places in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Make sure you come hungry because every course is sure to please. They have a broad spectrum of food that is sure to satisfy even the pickiest of people, and I speak from experience. Too many restaurants serve food that is weak on flavor but the food at Keegan's has an explosion of flavor. Don't let yourself be fooled by the food looking like what is typically served at any other grill. Don't be caught by surprise if the manager personally checks in on you and your food is out within minutes from ordering. My waiter was Jaimie and she will not let you down. This is not a place to pass up. Drop in and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch today. The chicken sandwich was great and the shrimp cocktail appetizer was good also. The price was right and the service was great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not a lot of choices for vegetarians but the veggie melt is good! They have the best Mac and cheese. Some staff are very friendly and others not so not. Suzy is literally the best and my favorite server!"}
{"text":"OMG !! I was introduced to Keegan's about 5 years ago when I moved to Chandler , hadn't been since then . Searched and found one near my new location and decided to have dinner there last night . The food , AMAZING . Customer service , AMAZING ! There isn't one bad comment I can make about the experience nor food at Keegan's . I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be taking my out of town visitors here as my new go to ."}
{"text":"When it was suggested that we head to Keegan's for dinner, I was pretty interested.  The Yelp reviews are fairly good, and the food choices seemed interesting.  However, we just had one issue after another during our visit.  To begin, we really wanted to partake in the happy hour. Unfortunately, they were only allowing patrons on the patio and in the bar use that pricing and menu.  Normally, I would understand this and sit there, but we had a handicapped member of our party who was incapable of sitting at the high-top tables in the bar area, and there was smoking on the patio. Yuck!  We mentioned this to our server, who just said that it was too bad we couldn't take part.    We ordered a number of things at our table.  The daily special of brisket (I think) was ordered by 2 of our guests, and it looked and tasted delicious.  I wish I had ordered that!  I shared the queso dip to start.  Great chips, good pretzel bites, but terrible queso!  It reminded me more of a saucer of milk.  It was so ridiculously runny that it just poured off of the chip and made a mess all over the table, as I tried to get it to my mouth.  The taste wasn't bad, but it was just impossible to eat.  The fried chicken, sliders, and grilled cheese were all decent, but none stood out.  I was greatly underwhelmed by the cobbler.  There was very little fruit, and the dessert was greatly lacking.   While looking around at other tables, it appeared that many diners has delicious looking meals.  Perhaps the fail was in what we chose to order?  I would consider a re-visit, but this definitely isn't a spot I'm anxious to return to."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok. Decent beer selection. They got the temp right on my burger. My wife had salmon. The consensus was good service but lackluster flavors. Everything needed more seasoning."}
{"text":"Had res for 8 at 5:30 and all was in order. Immediate seating and server Devon. Had concerns at first when order of 4 Hurricanes came with only two hurricane glasses. In addition e-mail showed $4 hurricanes and table tent showed $5. Devon checked and table tent was wrong and e-mail price was right. No draft beer available system being worked on. Both e-mail and table tent had no price shown for Gumbo which was $1.95 extra-long big deal. Gumbo and jambalaya was good as was the service including bill presentation."}
{"text":"This place is a great surprise! The Niman Ranch burger is delicious, my favorite burger in the Valley. The potato skins are crispy and amazing. The patio seating is awesome."}
{"text":"Keegan's is locked in a bottle of time from Days Gone Bye. The menu hasn't changed much in a decade or dare I say two. And for some that's just fine. Me included. Men of a certain age that like Stein Mart you know and the golf shirts that go with. Lol. Ordered the Niman burger that didn't come medium as requested but was tasty nonetheless. Ordered the Thai Cobb and the dressing was delicious sweet and spicy ginger based. The cold salmon made it a healthy choice. They should have served it in a bowl and layered it with lots more tender greens as a base but that's just my worthless opinion! Good selection of spirits wines and beer. Wish Meagan were a bit friendlier but maybe she was just having a bad hair day? She may have been busy working the bar and tables when we visited. This was a one and done with nothing truly compelling to bring me back. For you veggie-Matics  there appear to be some friendly choices."}
{"text":"Russian waitress (who also is a graphic designer) very pushy, but food was good on this night. It was after 8pm on a Saturday night and there were still plenty of tables available inside or outside. The potato skins were epic at $7 loaded with bacon and cheese. Those came from the HH menu which still kicks in after 8pm. My main course was the Chicken Madiera and this was a great version loaded with mushrooms and a great sauce covering two cutlets. The cheesy mashed potatoes were cut cross-style and this was one of the better versions I have had in my eating career. The only miss was the quinoa and rice side dish and the fish tacos were served with flour tortillas, not corn, which is more traditional. Beer prices also discounted after 8pm. Oh and the green chile cheese mac is very spicy, so beware."}
{"text":"Recently found a Keegan's Grill in the neigborhood. Some say it's a chain restuarant . I don't know but it doesn't feel like one nor does the menu.  I went to happy hour today and had nachoes for $4 and could not finish them. They were so good yet very simple. The flour tortilla chips they make and use are awesome. They are light and crunchy and tasty and take nachoes with cheese to a new level! Even with Salsa they are great  I also sampled the hot artichoke dip with one of these chips also and found it to be very good also.  Bartender Mellisa does a good job fixing everyone drinks and recognizing the regulars.  also they offer two happy hours a 3pm - 6:30 pm and a night one also."}
{"text":"Had a great frittata breakfast with rosemary potatoes and cheddar biscuits. Not a spot of grease on the plate. Atmosphere casual, no wait like they hav next door at Matt's Big Breakfast. Forget the hype and eat some GOOD food!"}
{"text":"Amazing rib special on Saturdays. Comes with coleslaw and super crispy and fresh French fries. I ordered for pick up so that was a nice surprise. They even thought to add an extra side of bbq sauce. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice place with solid menu items.  The cheese chorizo appetizer is awesome although I wish they'd bring back the pretzels that went with it. The 20 year tacos are awesome. Also the chicken madeira is one of my favorites. Tonight we tried the French dip which was great too with perfect bread and a great horseradish.   Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with a meetup group and ordered the lobster tail & petite filet special.Cleaned my plate? Great food & great service! my first time here will definately be back."}
{"text":"Awful experience.  - Waitress got the order wrong and did not apologize - Drinks were empty the entire meal as the waitstaff did not come to refill the water - Brussels sprouts were soggy and definitely not fresh - Waitress slammed down the food at the opposite end of the table and walked away - There was bluish/green detergent pooled at the bottom of one of the dishes (side order of chicken) - Got a terrible case of food poisoning shortly after the meal  Will not ever be returning."}
{"text":"I have been going to Keegans on Camelback off and on for 20 years, or at least as long as it has been open.  Tonight is the last.  I love dogs, but I do not think they belong in a restaurant. I understand service dogs; this was not, it was someone's little pet.  The worst part of it was that the manager was talking to the table.  We thought he would send them outside to the patio(68 degrees this evening), but they stayed there. I don't know how the Health Department feels about dogs sitting on a diner's lap in a busy dining room...but I think it is inexcusable."}
{"text":"It has been 18 months . Server was a little  sassy and knew my colleague.  Had their soup and sandwich.  Lentil soup was excellent  with a nice rich broth. Mini slider was tasty . Good experience"}
{"text":"i was disappointed with the food.  Nice patio atmosphere.  I ordered the flank steak for $16.95---medium rare.  Flank steak has a very distinctive grain---what I got was not flank steak---perhaps round steak.  Not tender, not tasty, not medium rate.  I mentioned the fact that it was well done to my server and another person waiting on the table---they were not concerned nor did they attempt to remedy the situation.  .  I hesitated to send it back---although I should have--because the \"occasion\" was more important than the food.   This was the first time, in a long time, I have  eaten dinner at Keegans rather than just go there for happy hour or lunch.  I would definitely pick a different restaurant for dinner in the future."}
{"text":"We visited here a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that the food was really good. What absolutely killed it for us, to this point that we will not be back, is the service. HORRIBLE!! The waitress that we had, had zero personality, and was down right rude. She was not attentive at all to our needs, and was more concerned about the other tables around us. When I brought this to her attention, she was literally argumentative. \"Sir, I have refilled your drink, what more do you want?\" That is a direct quote. I said, \"wow, you are very rude, and combative as well, great service!\" Off to the manager we went, who at first seemed apologetic, but then changed her tune, saying that she was a great waitress, and that we should come back in a give her another try....WHAT???? Are you kidding me!!! Not only will we not try her again, we will not try them again. Your food may be on point, and delicious, but if your service/attitude is horrible, then its truly pointless! AVOID THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite of ours...everything we've tried is flavorful and prepared perfectly! Great atmosphere and friendly service takes it to a full 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great prices for happy hour. Service is always stellar. Definitely ask to sit outside. Try the firecracker shrimp!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever had.  What bad luck lately.  Almost two hour dinner because of SERVICE. 30 minutes in and finally our children were given drinks and our orders were finally taken.  No apology on how long things were taking.  I understand that places get busy, but as a paying customer we are not an inconvenience and all it takes is a simple \"I'm sorry it's taking awhile I'm so busy today.\"  Food was actually good quality and portions were very decent size.  If service was better this would have been at least a three star.  The cherry on top was when I asked why we were charged for chocolate milk when it says on the kids menu that milk is free; instead of our waiter saying she would ask the manager about it she told me she didn't write the menu. VERY rudely. So unimpressed. Food three stars, service one!"}
{"text":"Their special dessert right now for the holiday season is eggnog creme brulee.  It is so decadent and delicious!  Keegans always has great steaks.  Burgers are pretty good too.  Try their Filet Medallion Stroganoff.  It is yummy!  Decent wine selection and beer selection.  I recommend the Josh Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon if you like red wine.    Service is pretty consistent here.  Even when they are really busy on weekend nights, the waiters still check on you a lot and are pretty quick."}
{"text":"Having moved into a new neighborhood, I was looking for some good meal locations with a good bar.  I used to eat at another Keegans location in Phoenix previously and noticed that this location was near my new house.  I decided to stop in for a try the fare and drinks to see if this could be one of my regular hangouts.   The venue is very well done with a separate dining room and a beautiful bar area.  I decided to sit at the bar since it was close to the drinks I would be consuming.  After I looked at the menu I found item that I love and is rare to find in the Phoenix area. steamed mussels.  I ordered a beer which was delivered in record time and an order of the mussels.  Since it was Happy Hour the charge was well within the acceptable range for this item.  The mussels were firm and well done with an excellent mixture of garlic and butter sauce.  With the bread this was a meal.  I did find 4 unopened shells which means\"dead mussels\".  I mentioned this to my server and she readily replaced those with some new ones.  Well done.... I will be back to try some of the other items on this menu and enjoy the surroundings of this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good bar food, decent prices what more could you ask for? Wings here are pretty awesome and burgers are good. Got lots of Dog Fish beers on tap which is a major plus."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar on several occasions, a couple times for happy hour and a couple times paying retail.  I seem to be hooked on their nacho mama's chips because every so often I get a strong craving for them.  They're different from the typical chip, its somehow puffed up.  The salsa that comes with it is a good accompaniment and I always end up going through at least 1 refill of it.  I usually don't like the cheese melted on top method that solidifies halfway through (versus the nacho cheese sauce), but it goes well with the chips.  I think if you have 3-4 people and you share its perfect, portion wise and cheese wise.  The sliders are ok, pretty typical.  Kinda dry, I like to cover mine with ketchup.  The crapcakes are good, but pretty small.  I keep meaning to try some of the dinner items on the menu.  The beer is kinda pricey retail - it was $5 for draft hefeweisens when i went last night.  It wasn't happy hour but geez.."}
{"text":"I am a bartender/server of 3 years therefore, I know what to look for. When I walked into this bussiness, i was greeted with a confused stare, then eventually offered a table. After a few awkward minutes, i was taken to a side away from every other table, on the opposite side of the restaurant. Of course, I was the only black person there. Not once did the server or bartender take their eyes off of me. My every move was watched the restaurant was a quiet murmur. I felt so uncomfortable and pressured that I put my hand over face to look at the menu in peace. I dont expect anyone of caucasion decent to understand this feeling. However i will never ever step foot in this place again. I will never forget my experience there and i will tell everyone about it. Growing up in a military family i guess i was sheltered to this treatment but i know now the feeling i hear about and see so much in movies. This restaurant brought those stories to life. I ended up leaving two dollars on the table for the water i received but decided i wouldnt be able to eat in peace. On my way out i was watched and even encouraged. Very cold and uninviting. I encourage anyone who is against discrimination and racism to avoid this bussiness"}
{"text":"Only had soup and salad and it is hard to mess it up but the soup (lentil) was delicious and most importantly it was hot. The house salad was adaquate.  Service was friendly and timely. I would recommend this bistro for its price and food"}
{"text":"A great upscale sports bar/pub. The food was pretty good and they had fresh baked pie!!!....not a regular thing on a pub menu....try their Fish and Chips!!! oh they hit the spot.  Sport a seat in one of their booths near the front so you can see the flat screen tvs - service was good too. Always a great place to stop in on the Camelback corridor."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  The steak sandwiches are excellent as is the roasted chicken, and the entree salads.  This is also a great place to go for a business lunch in South Chandler."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. They have the fresh food, great combinations of ingredients, tons of craft beer, and the best lunch specials. I have a gluten and dairy allergy and they were very accommodating. I had the Thai Cobb salad and my dad had the Rueben. Soooo delicious, fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"The food is just ok nothing special. I had the fish and chips I would rather them be battered and not Panko crusted. The service is just ok too. I did enjoy the cold beer."}
{"text":"Keegan's is one of my favorite places to to eat!  The food is excellent and made fresh daily. The pan roasted Turkey and Cranberry sandwich is SO good. The pretzel bun is delicious. They have the Best patio in Chandler, offer a wide variety of wine and beer and the service is excellent. I will continue to visit regularly!!"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner last night, had a good experience. The place was busy but still had a few seats open at the bar and a few tables open.  I ordered the grilled pork porterhouse, with the green chile mac and cheese and baby dill carrots. The sides were nothing special - the mac and cheese probably could have used a little more cheese or chiles, but the carrots were about what I would expect. The pork was excellent, and came with a side of a weird blueberry applesauce which was very good.  For dessert, I had a carrot cake, which wasn't on the menu but must have been a special or something. To be honest, it didn't look that exciting on the outside, but it actually tasted very good. One of the better carrot cakes I've had.  Seems like a friendly place, a good place for either happy hour or a meal."}
{"text":"Food & service is cosistently good. Not the typical bar food. One of our regulars in Ocotillo area."}
{"text":"This is a place that i would go once in a while if i lived in the area my wife and i hit the chandler mall for a minute and decided to take the xtra trek to keegans the ambiance is nice the beer selection good my wife had the pastrami sandwich which was pretty uneventful i had the wings and a small salad which we both thought were good the better choice of the two"}
{"text":"Well I've seen Keegan's many, many times as I've passed by them and recently saw them on Check Please AZ. Grabbed my wife and took her to dinner. We chose to sit at the bar tonight. Great drink menu and great craft beer selection.  Firecracker shrimp for an appetizer I had the fish and chips Wife had cobb salad with chicken. I have nothing bad to say about Keegan's.........it was a solid middle of the road C+. I added the + because of a great beer selection. Will I come back? Maybe if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in a couple of years so was totally surprised when we walked in the door. They have completed remodeled since our last visit - from darkish and pub-like, to open, bright and modern.   Three of our group ordered the firecracker shrimp tacos and said they were delicious - not spicy as the name implies. The South by Southwest chicken was good, a tad bit dry, but flavorful.   The margaritas were delicious!! Not sicky-sweet so they went down easy...maybe a little to easy!  They have specials - one was the Maryland-style crab cakes. One of our group is from Maryland and warned us that when you see \"style\" in the description of a Maryland crab cake to stay away! They are Maryland crab cake wannabes! We took his advice.  The staff was friendly and attentive. Hopefully it won't be years before we return. We had a great experience and I'm ready for another one of those margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burglars !!!!!   Cod fish was awesome,,,,,,,,didn't  get a refill on my ice tea, but server was polite"}
{"text":"Ate here recently with a large group.  While we appreciated that they had the capacity to serve our group, the service could have been better.  My sandwich was incorrectly placed on someone else's plate, and the server just put it on a different plate, added the salad and gave it to me.  The other  person in our group had already touched it, so I wasn't thrilled that it was given to me at that point.  While the sandwich tasted fine, I had a hard time getting past that.  In the end, I placed cash in the presenter and waited for some time for my change, which never came.  Because we were in a hurry, I didn't bother waiting around.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Road trip to catch a concert in Phoenix and planned to hang out in Chandler while traffic thinned out into Phoenix.   I had on an ealier trip found Keegan's Grill, but did not have time to give them a try.  Tonight seemed like the perfect opportunity.    We got there early and had no problem getting a great seat on the patio, right in front of the fireplace.  On any other night, fireplace and Phoenix may not mix but tonight a little warmth was needed. Service was great and very patient with our questions and giving us time to decide on what we wanted. We started with Schreiner's Chorizo Con Queso.  The dip was warm and had just the right amount of spice to be warm but not overpowering your taste buds with hot.  The chips were amazing and so fresh plus there were two types a corn and flour type which gave nice variety. Clam chowder was next for this rare chilly night.  They did a great job making it creamy and thick.  Our main meal was the Smoked Jalopeno Bacon Burger.   It was great and I was glad I decided to split it with my wife because the burger was huge. I am so glad my travel plans worked a stop at Keegan's Grill and will keep on my list for return visits."}
{"text":"Met up with a group of friends here on a Monday night... a big group. Although Keegan's had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc. Beers were poured fast; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected. The outside patio space was great on a warm AZ night... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived. The happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails."}
{"text":"Ok, after wondering how the reviews on this place were so mixed, I had it happen to me. After about 4 or 5 flawless outings, we had a bad experience with the food.  The steaks came out cold and significantly undercooked, instead of properly seared and delicious. One cut was well below restaurant-quality.  We had a side of the dill carrots (which are normally amazing) and they tasted like they had just come out of the grocery store freezer bag and were boiled in dishwater.  It was like being at a totally different restaurant.  The service was excellent as usual, but if this had been my first trip, there is no way I would have come back on the basis of the food."}
{"text":"Decided to give Keegan's another try earlier this year and have been delightfully surprised with better food and service. Their happy hour menu is only offered in the bar seating area--take advantage of it if you can as it offers great selections at reasonable prices. The queso dip is one of my favorites. Their burgers have also improved and are big enough for sharing. Mixed drinks are still a bit inconsistent...depends on the bartender on duty, I guess. However, the improvement in food and waitstaff makes it worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday night a month a month ago, been busy with work, so no time to post this review in a timely manner. I sat at the bar, and one other couple  on one side, and a couple of guys on the other, and me. The bartender seemed very involved with the couple, sharing pics on their smartphones, all the while she passed by me 2-3 times, and never acknowledged me in the least, I looked at the beer menu, ready to order, and after about 10 minutes of being ignored, I got up and walked out. Not sure if it's the same owners as Ahwatukee, but this would never happen at the Ahwatukee location, use to go there w/o any issues! Not sure I'll go back to the chandler location."}
{"text":"So I have to update this review as we have returned back to Keegan's on many occasions since and have become regulars and have had great service and terrific food. The server that helped us on our first visit was new and even if she told us that we would have understood but would have still walked out. Please to all servers, if you are new or overwhelmed just tell your customers. You can lose good/reliable happy customers, seriously. We took a chance and returned and am so glad we did. The daily specials are well worth the price and are delicious. Great items are their Chicken fried steak, BBQ ribs, Bolognese, Stroganoff, Filet Mignon and Pork Tenderloin."}
{"text":"Comfortable little place - well rounded menu, great beer selection, with great service at the bar. Apparently a lot of locals frequent for eat-in as well as takeout, and i can see why. I had the nightly special: chicken breast with goat cheese and pasta with chunky tomato sauce - nice dish. Bartender was great and efficient in her service all around the bar on this Saturday night at 7:30pm. In and out in :40 with 30-odd diners in house. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Originally planned to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but there was a wait so we walked over to Keegan's where there was no wait. The waitress was attentive and friendly. The pancake was good. The bacon was not good, ate 1 piece and left the rest. Overall the food was mediocre to say the least. With so many restaurants to choose from, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by Keegan's to eat corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day. I've never ordered this dish before so I didn't know if I was going to like it or not. I ended up loving it!  The corned beef was lean and tender and the veggies were perfectly seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I'd definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food and service has always been phenomenal. Turkey burger is the best I've ever had. Great atmosphere  you can sit outside, bar or dining room and you will have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Recently dined at Keegan's with a group, and was concerned about what I'd eat since I'm not a fan of bar & grill food. They had an excellent Thai Chopped Salad with salmon that was so beautifully presented on the plate, it captured everyone's attention! In fact, we were all so captivated that I forgot to take a picture! It was beyond delicious, and I'll definitely enjoy it again...and photograph it next time!  Friends recommended the fish & chips and the beef stroganoff, so several in our party ordered those dishes, and enjoyed them. Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Just left Keegan\"s. We've been to this place many times and I always order the char grilled filet and it has been very good. I ordered medium and it came out charred on the outside and more raw on the inside. I ate around the edges and the more I got to the center the more dark red it was. This is what they call medium. Showed a picture of what medium looks like and asked her to go tell the cook what a medium steak looks like. She said I should have told her and she would send it back. I ate about half and told her no thank you, I have a phobia of sending back food to the cook. She continued to make excuses fro the cooks and then proceeded to make me feel like it was my fault because I didn't say anything and they don't cut into to check it. they wait until I do. I explained a professional cook would know what medium is by time and the temperature of the center of the steak. She continued to make excuses for them. It also took a very long time to get our meals, 2 fish dinners and my filet. When we said something about it she made more excuses about being packed and my steak taking so long. This is the story as it happened. There is no exaggeration. When I told her how displeased I was she only offered to send it back. She didn't bother to call a manager or take anything off the bill. So I can only say that although I have been hear many times, I may never go back, and if I do, I will pull a picture out of a medium cooked steak and tell them I want it cooked like that."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 15 years, and I am extremely disappointed with the decline in the service. I came in tonight for an appetizer and a beer, and waited over 30 minutes to get my food. I sat at the bar and the bartenders we noon attentive at all.  The food was still excellent, but I am hesitant to go back due to the slow service."}
{"text":"It's hard to say anything really bad about this place, but then again, it's also hard to say anything good about it. I guess if I had to characterize this bar/restaurant I would say that it's mediocre in almost every way. Let me start with the beer selection: not a lot on draft. The fact that a supposedly Irish bar doesn't have staples like Smithwick's or Guinness is disappointing. The food is hit or miss. The vegetable melt was extremely soggy and unappetizing, but the firecracker tacos were acceptable. I wouldn't go here expecting too much. The price isn't bad, but it's more than the food is worth."}
{"text":"I visited the bar here while waiting for my wife to have a manicure done.  I was joined by my nephew and eventually my son and his girlfriend.  The bar tender was very attentive and friendly.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  When my wife was finished we decided to stay and have dinner.  It was pretty good as well with good, friendly service too.  I had the pot roast special and really enjoyed it.  Everyone else in our party was pleased with their entree orders as well."}
{"text":"Our first time here - food was really good with great menu selection.  Our server, Madison, was awesome.  A real asset to your company!"}
{"text":"I have only been here one time but I will say that I am a fan of the food and the staff. This place is definitely a Phoenix original and I can only image on the photos on the wall are from it's glory days of Phoenix locals that made this place what it has been over the years. A great little pub to get good food & good service!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is top quality and consistently good. The servers are very attentive and friendly.  We eat there quite often and never had a bad meal!!"}
{"text":"Great place around biltmore.  Good food at a low price, and has the most beautiful and friendly bartender in Autumn.  I would recommend this place for anyone who just wants to have some good food and a few drinks to wound down."}
{"text":"This gem is right across the street from where I work. They had so many different choices for food! I got the shrimp tacos and I loved them! I plan to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the Turkey Burger at this establishment. I have eaten here multiple times always getting the Turkey Burger. It's infused with garlic & spices  when paired with a pretzel bun is delicious! Maybe the best Turkey Burger in the valley."}
{"text":"Food quality is good and the atmosphere is relaxing. They need to expand their menu a bit, I'd go there more but the choices are so limited."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the fish tacos and the rotisserie chicken the salad croutons were amazing too ! Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"It's pretty silly that they close their kitchen 1 hour before they close the restaurant, maybe they haven't realized that on both yelp and apple maps their hours of operation go until 11 and don't specify that the kitchen closes at ten. Ps: we got there at 10:04 when they turned us away, if I hadn't looked up their hours before hand I probably wouldn't have been rubbed such the wrong way about it. It all turned out ok though there was a place open nearby that had a much better vibe."}
{"text":"Nice place to go and have a drink and watch sports. It's not very big on the inside and the bar is not very large either. The wait staff is friendly, but during happy hour, they don't come very often to the tables around the bar. Going up to the bar might be your best bet.  The potato skins are really good...they are thin, so you get about twenty or so on the plate. They are a tad on the greasy side, which makes them even better.  The other food is just OK...nothing really spectacular. The croutons they use in the caesar salad are odd tasting, and I don't like when places used chopped lettuce in caesar salads. I prefer the larger leafs.  The beer selection is medium sized...a little smaller than what I would think a place that bills itself as a taproom would offer."}
{"text":"5-stars for all the natural and grass-fed meats on the menu, and some of the best wings (not greasy) anywhere in the valley.  The service has been great when we've come mid-afternoon.  But a visit at 5:30 had us waiting at our table so long with no waitstaff anywhere in sight we just got up and left.    We always sit in the bar, and are happy hour fans.  Fans of the food.  The drinks are fine - but not extensive.  If you want comfortable booths in the bar with beer and wings - this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here tonight and after waiting for an hour and a half the restaurant cancelled the order. No reason.....no refund,,,,Just F@#King cancelled....as you can see it is on Valentine's day. SUPER AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"After a 10+ year gap, me and Da Beau have rediscovered this neighborhood eatery. It is a shadow of its former self.    Delicious homemade grub. Downright reasonable prices. Just the right size servings. Friendly staff. Comfortable seating. You can hear yourself think and the conversation within your table. I don't recall seeing one TV (Praise the Lord!).    After two visits their only challenge is spicing-up the rather flat-tasting Carrot Cake by reintroducing coconut to the batter and tarting-up the cream cheese icing: though I did appreciate the abundance of chopped walnuts inside the cake.   Me and Da Beau will definitely be back as the joint is now a new favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Me and my fiancée went there yesterday.  The food was delicious. And we had the coolest server ever! Toma was on top of it. And had some great food recommendations.  I hadn't been here in a while and glad I came back!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot that's near our home. Haven't tried dinner yet but their specials sound good!"}
{"text":"Cool place, indoor and outdoor seating, friendly, attentive wait staff, great food and fast service! I tried the Asian Salmon Cobb salad at the suggestion of our wonderful server, Megan. Wow! Loaded with salmon, cucumber, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, cranberry, etc. it was so interesting and yummy! The only weird thing, freeze-dried corn kernels. Loved the dressing, too. Hubby got a big, juicy, delicious burger that did not disappoint. My Moscow Mule was perfection but my hubby's sangria was sort of watered-down, I guess you could say. Would highly recommend Keegan's!!"}
{"text":"Don't go there. They have limitations one shot per hour. The GM isn't friendly and could careless. You can tell the staff isn't well trained. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. fresh amazing soups. great burgers. the steak they put on the salad is super. I go to this place for their cobb salad at least once a month if not once a week.  now..... I know the place shares the name with the restaurant in Ahwatukee but they are worlds apart. if I had gone to the one in Ahwatukee first, I would not have tried this place. this place is great and the other worthless.  Great staff too. I go for lunch and they get you served fast enough to enjoy your lunch in the hour and get back to work on time."}
{"text":"DELICIOSO food , I had the tuna sandwich along with the potato soup amazing it hit the spot. The girls at the bar very friendly .  Fast and Attractive.  FRIENDLY ====im coming back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.   Terrible food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Had lunch outside on the patio. Service was very slow. After we finished lunch and after waiting for your check for 10 minutes I went inside to ask the server for our bill. Do not choose the outside seating. Service is much better inside. Such a shame when he weather is so nice in February."}
{"text":"Turkey burger, gluten free bun and the tomatoes with basil aioli on the side.  It's a dream.  My family has tried many different items and never a complaint.  Worth the wait but we never come at peak times, always early or late to miss the crowds.  I've only had 1 bad experience where they did not make mine gluten free and I had to wait 30 minutes for it to be re-made.  I think that's a little long to grill a turkey burger.  My entire family was done and waiting on me.  Cute patio for al fresco dining."}
{"text":"Not an area I frequent, but ran across this place and decided to try it.   We enjoyed the patio atmosphere even though it was mid June. They had a very unique beer list and I had a hard time choosing just one.   Menu had a lot of good choices and priced reasonably.  I tried the world's greatest meatball sub,  which is probably a stretch,  but was good and the French fries had a lot of flavor. Too bad it isn't in more common area for me because I would definitely  go again."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to lunch the other day and I have to say it was the first time I was disappointed in Keegan's. We both ordered a half chicken salad sandwich from the half sandwich menu, and it didn't state the bread. It came with Ryebread which we questioned and they said they could trade it out for brioche or wheat. I traded mine out for brioche, and it was two slices of extremely stale dry bread with nothing on it. No mayonnaise no butter no toasting no nothing. The chicken salad was tasteless and no amount of salt and pepper was going to fix it. And when they took the sandwiches back to change the bread, they didn't reheat the fries, so the french fries were barely room temperature. Very very disappointing. And after I took a poll of all of my friends to ask what kind of bread they would expect a chicken salad to be on, everybody was flabbergasted when I said that Keegan's defaults to Ryebread. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Best place to go and enjoy your dinner and have a drink . Very inviting and friendly staff !!! Good job on the chicken wings , bravo!!! I recommend this place very highly!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Excellent service.  Happy hour pricing is a real deal.  Nice patio.  Went there at 6 pm on Friday and was seated immediately outside.  Will return again.  Looks like a great place to watch sports at the bar or for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Moved into the area months ago and we like to try and support the local area restaurants. The Happy Hour prices are just as awesome as the food! The jerk ribs were so flavorful and tender I can't wait to have them again and love the fact they have grill chicken wings that happen to be amazing. The homemade sangria is a must at $5 a glass it is definitely one of best around.  Autumn in the bar was sweet and very attentive if you have chance to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Don't go here thinking you're getting a gourmet meal. It's really good food. A few notches above decent bar food. It's a good place that I'll go back to for sure. It's not an anniversary dinner place and more of an important birthday kind of place. Great beer selection. Great service. Satisfying food. What more could you ask more?"}
{"text":"Hmmm, what can I say about Keegan's Grill?  I'm a rib lover so I remember the ribs fondly, however, it had strong pros and cons... with more cons than pros.    The pros were the ribs and the comfy casual feel of the restaurant.  The ribs were delicious... wish I'd have ordered them.  We got a full rack thinking we'd have leftovers but, finished them all.  The cons... my shrimp pasta dish was really really watery and weak.  It was also luke warm... so much so that I worried later about possibly getting sick (I didn't).  I would have had it warmed more but, our pretty blond server was not very attentive.  It was a really busy night but, drinks went out and we waited long periods of time for... everything.  Normally I don't mind that too much but this was enough for even me to notice.   Would I come back?  Yes... for the ribs.  But if I have another lukewarm experience... it probably won't be worth the drive for a 3rd trip.    Might see ya there."}
{"text":"Very Good. It may be a little pricy but the food is worth it! Lunch specials & daily dinner specials. Try the Austrain Beef Soup (if on the menu) & the Jalapeno Bacon Burger."}
{"text":"Great location in the Biltmore area. I enjoy their potato skins. The sauce adds great flavor."}
{"text":"My wife works in the area, so we thought we'd stop and get a bite after work.  They had some good appetizer specials price wise.  The potato skins were very good.  The artichoke dip was not hot (which means it's not in health code most likely...)  We split the \"fillet\" stroganoff.  I ordered it medium.  The server brought it out and it was very rare.  Also, it was mangled and not cut nicely.  She said \"lemme take that back\"... She brought it back and it was WELL done.  At this point I was so hungry and tired of waiting I just ate it.  The meat was tough.  It seemed more like a sirloin cut, and as I said it was well done.  The stroganoff sauce was very salty and seemed almost like a store bought packet.  Upon getting home I started to have a stomach ache.  On a positive note, I have been there before and received much better food.  Lastly, the service was \"ok\"... It was an underwhelming experience.  For $16 for an entree I expected much more.  I doubt I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the portions make this one of our Phoenix area favorites. Great adult beverages huge beer and wine selections. The daily specials are awesome"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly service, great full bar...looks warm and inviting.  The food: - chicken quesadilla...very good! - house merlot...awesome - not on the menu but has cult following: Greek Chicken Sandwich...I don't usually get sandwiches for dinner, but ths was soo good I will continue to get this for dinner.  Service: - friendly, fun  Venue:  - when you walk in you see these massive natural would beams/posts in front of the bar...step-up booths at bar very cool.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The visit took place on a Thursday at 1:00 PM. Parking was a problem. The large shopping center lot is nearly full. Expect to spend some time looking for a parking place.  The exterior is sleek. There is a place for outdoor dining which has a Television. The TV was turned to a sports station and silent.  Keegan's lunch menu is rather extensive. Please check the menu on their website for what they serve but not for prices. The online menu is inaccurate.  The service was brisk without being rushy. The tables had white clothes on them. Noise did not intrude on your conversation, and over all the appearance of the dining room was pleasant.  The salads looked good, and so did the other food that was served. I had the \"combo\" for $8 or $9.95. I chose black bean salad. That cam in a square little serving bowl. It looked good and was pleasantly piquant. There was not a lot of cumin and I think no chipotle, but over all it was very good. The turkey and cheddar in the sandwich was moist and flavorful. The thick cut brown bread was hard and dry in areas where it had been cut in half (so it was standing there drying out)  I was not offered Mayonnaise, I didn't ask.  I had some good things about this place. It must be the salads. Between the parking and the dried bread it rates two stars. I'm sorry to give a full service American Restaurant like this such a low rating. Maybe I was there at a bad time."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this neighborhood gem!  Keegan's is a warm and inviting restaurant.  I went on a Thursday night and it was busy, fortunately they had a couple of empty tables.  Every seat at the bar was taken.   They have a special every day of the week.  Thursday's is pot roast with all the trimmings.  Delicious! I want to come back every day to try them all! Another favorite in my party was the grilled flatiron steak, served with two sides of your choice.    One of the great things about Keegan's is it was full of regulars.  Everyone dining there seemed to know the staff and vice versa.  It was really a nice feeling.  Restaurants like that are hard to come by these days!  Our server was amazing and went out of her way to make us feel welcome.    I can't wait to be one of the Keegan's regulars and try all of those daily specials!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to frequent the Keegan's in Ahwatukee, but we have moved from that area and are slightly closer to this Camelback location.  We ate breakfast at this location for the first time yesterday.  I found the service to be a bit slow, but our server was very polite and accomodating.  I ordered the cinnamon brioche french toast. I would go as far to say this is the best french toast I have ever eaten. It was so moist and tasty!   I like the set up of the Ahwatukee location better. The bathrooms at this location are not as nicely kept as the 'tukee location.  I'll definitley be back for Sunday brunch again for some of that great french toast and hope to check it out for dinner some night. Keegan's usually has some good, home cooking dinner specials, so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Happy Hour on the weekend, yasss my kind of place! Hummus, wings, and salad was great. Had a sangria and margarita, which were yummy. I will def go again."}
{"text":"Went with my Mom, GMa and Aunt. My Aunt had steak which was incredible,  GMa had a Saturday pork special which was very good. I had chicken which was not bad but I would not order again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have just recently discovered Keegan's and we are in love. The fact that their happy hour starts at 8 is by far the BEST thing ever. It also makes it our go to place. I'm pretty sure in the last two weeks after we 1st visited we've been back 5 or 6 times. The prices are perfect, the service is great and the food is really delicious. I wasn't putting a lot of hope in the food but everything that we've tried has been very good. My only suggestion would be that they turn down the grill and cook the food a bit longer. I had to have them remake one of my sliders and I've seen other situation were people asked for their food to be cooked more. But the food tastes so good that it isn't even an issue for me or my usually very picky boyfriend :) we just make sure to have them cook everything well. All in all, I dig this place and will continue to visit every few days or so."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great prices! Super service. We went there two nights in a row.  Grilled salmon tacos are delicious as is the chicken Madeira. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. Not sure how long that has been but at least 7 yrs. love many things in the menu and they are very flexible with letting you change it up. Service is always good as well."}
{"text":"I don't give bad reviews too often, but this place was terrible! Six of my family members decided to grab dinner this past Sunday. We didn't want to drive far, so we figured we would go someone close! Man, I wish we would have taken the drive! I ordered salmon and it dry, over-cooked, flavorless and luke-warm! My dad got the ribs and he said they were terrible. My husband got the fish tacos and he barely ate them. I was so embarrassed because we brought another couple with us and I hope they won't hold this against us! #disappointed #gross"}
{"text":"Since our 1st choice for a late mother's day lunch was a 2 hour wait, we came over here. Even though the patio was only 1/2 full, we were told a 10 min wait. The lunch menu looked ok, I had a beer and the wife a sangria. Ordered the hummus for an app. I ordered a burger, and the wife 1/2 sandwich with side special. Hummus was good, drinks were too. Burger was way overdone. I had to send it back. Opted for a chicken salad sandwich, since family was 1/2 done before I could send it back. Sandwich was ok, fries were good. My wife was not impressed with her plate. The service was ok, she was very nice. I cant remember a time when I sent food back. You would think a manager would come over to apologize. Not that I was looking for my meal to be comped, but you would've thought that it would've happened. Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice place!  I ordered two small plates (bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and the two small burgers), a margarita, and a side of their cheddar potatoes, and it was all delish!  Service was good, wasn't too busy. I would go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere & service.  Wings, Taproom Steak Sandwich & Cuppa Cake are to die for!  Russian waitress Toma turns your dinner into wonderful experience. Great recommendations &  positive energy."}
{"text":"Perfect place for business lunch, as well as homemade comfy dinner -  quick, healthy, tasty, cheap and servers are very attractive."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment and good customer service. I am never disappointed with Keegan's. Dee is the best!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. My family had the fish and chips and they were happy. I had the salmon tacos and they were not very good.   Our server was not present.. she didn't even check in after we received our meal. It's rare that I think a server should receive less than 10% but this might be one of those occasions."}
{"text":"5 stars for Happy Hour!  What a deal!  Long hours... 2-6:30pm plus 8pm-close every day. Plus great prices...  $5 cocktails and food from $4-6. What a deal!  Combine this with Central Bistro, in the same parking lot with $1 oysters during their HH that also starts at 2pm weekdays (and $15 bottomless Bloody Mary's or Mimosas on the weekends) and this is a great way to say Happy Friday and start the weekend!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and thought even though this place is a bit on the pricey side im sure they have some type of lunch specials. Welp...they didnt let me down $6.95 for a full meal. Choose two of any of these items...there was about 15 different items from soup to burgers. Of course smaller portions but for me perfect. Even for a man who would maybe want larger portions to get two specials at $6.95 at this place thats a great deal. Cannot wait to go back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight, and loved the entire experience! The patio was roomy, our server was quick, and the food was delicious! I ordered the Thai Cobb salad and really enjoyed the unique, healthy flavor! My dinner was priced fairly and I got a lot of food. I will be going back"}
{"text":"Recently they raised prices and dropped the St. Louis Pork Ribs from the menu. My companion had the catfish and it was good. My entree was the Schreiner's Sausage Bolognese with Meatballs. The problem was that it didn't come with meatballs. They took one meatball and cut it in half. That isn't the plural meatballs. It also doesn't come with a side salad. It's unbelievable that people who own a business don't know how to run one. Never lie to a customer. Buy a bag of salad from the grocery store for a dollar, make 4 three ounce servings at 25 cents each and invest a couple of minutes putting it into bowls. That's what I do at home. We boycotted Macaroni Grill for years after telling them exactly that. We went to Carrabba's or Anzio's where their competition served a side salad. Macaroni Grill now serves a side salad with the pasta dishes. We would go back for the fish dishes, but have lowered our rating.  Macaroni Grill is back to charging for salad:  unlimited side of soup or salad with the purchase of any entree 2.49  so we're back to Anzio's."}
{"text":"Reverse Happy hour is the best!  Love the wings(they are grilled and not buffalo style but very tasty).  The skins are nice and crispy with lots of bacon and the kale salad is refreshing.  We go there a couple times a month and food, drink and service are consistently good."}
{"text":"Great local neighborhood place. Small menu and decent beer selection. Usually very crowded for dinner.   Have always had great food. Been here several times. The pork chops are my favorite but the seem to be gone from the menu. PLEASE BRING THEM BACK!!!  Good service. Can watch the game in the bar. Prices are a little high but the food does reflect.   Pretty pretty good"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat near our home in Chandler and it's only 2 miles away. My fave is the turkey sandwich on pretzel roll with cranberry sauce and their AWESOME sweet potato fries! The service is always good and the setting and atmosphere are great for a relaxing meal with friends or family."}
{"text":"We had a meet up group go to lunch at Keegan's Grill on Tuesday, Jan 30.  There were 12 of us so we ate in the back room.  Andrea was our server and she did a fantastic job.  She was attentive and didn't mess up the delivery of the orders.  Great.  From the comments of all present the food was great.  I had the Thai Cobb (I know by the name I thought a baseball was going to come with it.).  It was delicious and the spicy lemon vinaigrette dressing was something I had never tasted and it was delish.  I will go back."}
{"text":"My first time here is due to some awesome friends (Jane and Mark) who were just gafawed that I had not been to this chain delight before.  I walked into this venue with expectations of old age pensioners hanging out and chatting long hours while dining on mediocre not so seasoned food.  Initially, I did see the mature patrons but upon closer evaluation, they were trendy enough to have ornate dishes placed in front of them which hardly represented anything you'd see at any nursing home I could have imagined ending up at!  But wait...there is more.   Our hostess ( cannot remember her real name but we renamed her Ms. Arizona because I erroneously guessed that she would be from Montana)....WAS Amazing.  She was quinticentual hospitality with her bright smile, suggestive selling, and quirky wit!  I'm going back there just for that!  Now I better mention the good.  I had hummus which was not as lemony as I anticipated per the description, but if that is important to you, squeeze some fresh lemon on and you're good to go.  As luck would have it, it was suggested that we try the Austrian Beef Soup; a special menu item which may not be available everyday.  What a GREAT bowl of cream based chowder like stewish yumminess!  I could have stopped there, but well, you know... I indulge.  So I had the Positano sandwhich with the best shredded potato cheese au gratin.  It was divine!  Two perfectly prepared peppered and prime cut, plump, pieces of pleasantly positioned beef pucks on a garlic pistol bread with goat cheese and a side of tomato drizzled with basil cream dressing.  I cannot even get these words out on this page without drooling and letting you all know that I will certainly be ordering this again!  There MUST be a way that I can fit this into my diet.  UUGGGHHH!  Don't let my angst stop you from going.  Full marks from me are hard to acquire but they've done it!"}
{"text":"Keegan's is a great local restaurant in Chandler where you can go unwind with great drinks and food.   They have 20 beer drafts and I believe at least 15 of them change frequently, so you're constantly getting a variety of different options.  The food here is really good too, so many choices from sandwich to steaks. Pricing for a dinner was actually very fair as well.  There is usually a food special and drink special every day/month as well."}
{"text":"The salmon was burned and the rice was gross. They only had three choices for steaks. The service was VERY slow."}
{"text":"It's just a great place for us....close to home and a great bartender(Autumn). The people here are great and courteous."}
{"text":"Finally a place with giant salads!!! Good Prices! Cute Staff"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Keegans during happy hours and I ordered a draft beer.  When the bill came it was $5.00 for a draft.  I asked them how much the draft beer was normally and they said it was $5.00 to $6.00 depending on the beer.  I thought that was exceptionally high especially at happy hour."}
{"text":"I went to eat at Keegan ' s grill and asked to have my hamburger cut in half and the bartender told me that they don't do that. So again some worker's don't know customer service."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I want Keegans.  So yummy.  They have a delicious menu and great atmosphere!  Staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Food here is decent.  No doubt.  Actually pretty good.  The beer list is better than expected.  Mixed drinks are super cheap and not bad either.  But that's not the reason for the review.  That would warrant a 3 1/2.     The reason for 5 stars is the waitress.  Best server in a long time.  If u get lucky, ask for heather She had a great personality and fixed my wife's order after we ordered something we didn't want."}
{"text":"A couple of my girlfriends and I went to Keegan's Grill in Chandler last weekend to watch a football game. We sat at the bar and shared their amazing queso dip with pita bread. The bartender even suggested we try our queso with broccoli and brought some out for us to try! The Keg'r craft beers are really good! I tried the Oak Creek Hefeweizen and the Oak Creek Nut Brown and they were both amazing. Awesome experience and great food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had the fish n chips here. Not all that authentic but it wasn't terrible. It's a pretty posh ish place. Me buddy had the steak stroganoff and that actually looked delicious. Overall it was a good experience, price was okay, staff was super nice."}
{"text":"We live very close so we come here regularly. Spicy grilled chicken wings are delish. We also love the beef stroganoff. Service is always good. They have nice happy hour as well as reverse happy hour. Decent patio area when the weather is nice! Seems to be a bit of an older(retired) crowd, probably due to location. BTW, any tips on what they use in the wings?"}
{"text":"Normally good, but they really sucked last time. Becoming a hit and miss experience."}
{"text":"I've frequented this business a number of times, typically for business lunches. It's a nice place with comfortable seating and good food. I've had good experiences with the service as well. There's not typically a long wait for a table, which is really nice. It's not the largest lunch menu that I've ever seen but it's a nice variety and the items are done well. It's not an overly loud place so conversation can be had with no problem."}
{"text":"Keegan's Grill hs my father's 2nd favorite wings (he is an avid wing enthusiast).  They have great deli style sandwhiches, fresh tasting soups, and a friendly staff.  I only get to visit Phoenix a few times a year, but I try to make it to Keegan's at least once or twice a year."}
{"text":"My new home away from home.  As soon as I walk into Keegan's....the bar and waitstaff remember me and indulge in awesome conversation.  I always meet and have fun with the patrons as well.  It is like a family reunion....  And the food is amazing as well.  And please always remember to make room for their cobbler :)  Prices are very reasonable - and Happy Hour is a menu you can't beat.  (Football Sundays is also an all day happy hour as well)"}
{"text":"Take out usually isn't a problem at this establishment as they do a healthy lunch business.  Just this week though I was met with a missing lunch item and zero apologies!  Obviously the manager on duty realized what had happened - as soon as I walked through the door he said I have your wings and card (the girl gave me my bags and sent me on my way, it didn't even click I hadn't signed the card slip).  He beckoned me to follow him back to the expo window plopped down the card and bag and turned around with out another word.  He looked so cheerful the whole time I thought a \"sorry about that\" or SOMETHING/ANYTHING by way of apology would be offered since he watched me walk up out of the heat... but nope!  We order takeout about once a week from this location and walk over every time.  Now I really have to think, is it worth the possible round trip?"}
{"text":"I live in Tempe and so don't venture into Phoenix too often for lunch. My trip to Keegan's was an exception. I had been chatting with a girl on-line for awhile and we finally decided to meet in person for lunch. Loretta suggested Keegan's as a nice place for lunch relatively close to her. I, of course, agreed immediately. I would have met her pretty much anywhere she wanted. I got there first and holy smokes it was hot outside. I waited in the shade of their outdoor seating area and listened to the music piping out of the restaurant. I thought with a name like Keegan's it was probably an Irish pub. The music didn't sound very Irish. In fact, I think it was the Scissor Sisters. I felt like dancing, but I kept it together and acted cool.   Loretta arrived and looked very, very nice. After a nervous hello and some small talk, we went inside and were seated. Everything on the menu looked good. It was hard to choose. For starters I went with the baked onion soup. I really liked it. I joked to Loretta that normally onions weren't a good thing to be eating on a date, but since this was our first one we probably wouldn't be making out.(Ha Ha!) For my entree I had the open-faced steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. I absolutely loved that sandwich. The steak was very tender and cooked medium just like I requested. It was seasoned nicely too. The sweet potato fries were delicious. I was extremely pleased with the meal.   Now to be honest, I will admit that I was so stoked that we were hitting it off that I may be overrating the whole Keegan's experience. Loretta had the grilled chicken sandwich and said she liked it. We traded a bit off each other's plate and I can verify that it was tasty and tender. The bread on our sandwiches was also delicious. I don't remember a whole lot about the look of the place. It appeared clean and the waiter was nice. There was a lot of wood and leather about. We talked and laughed for quite a while and had a great time. We walked to a nearby gelato joint and had dessert. Between the after dinner mint, the gelato and some polar ice gum - I managed to get rid of the onion breath from the appetizer. Just in time, too. Contrary to my prediction, there actually was a little bit of making out. That was also excellent. I'm giving Keegan's four stars, but be advised that I was in a fantastic mood and a bit flustered from the snogging."}
{"text":"I love Keegan's ribs! A full rack is a steal at 20 bucks. I usually order by phone and pick them up and take home sided with steamed broccoli and cheesy potatoes. Last night I tried the crème brule and it was creamy and carmely deliciousness.   They have a great happy hour if you are in the hood, and this is also a wonderful place to take your grandparents. It is one of my grannies faves."}
{"text":"Service is slow.... so don't go here if you are in a rush. The outdoor patio is really awesome.   The food is fantastic! I LOVE the nachos. They are so, so good. They make the tortilla chips fresh and they are super thin."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is good! So good in fact that I can say in full confidence that you can order anything on the menu and leave happy and full.   Keegan's is my go to place when I am craving comfort food and a traditional old time atmosphere. They have the best Cobb salad in town (maybe anywhere)! The daily special is always scrumptious; some of my other favorites include the venerable vegetable melt, ribs, fish and chips, burger, French onion soup, and pasta. The portions are generous and everything is always cooked beautifully.   Sometimes I order to pick up and they have my food ready at the bar good to go. However I enjoy eating in as well; the ambiance is so lovely and comfortable, it makes you want to relax and slow life down. They are always busy, but never too busy to where you can't get in, and the food always comes out in a timely fashion. The wait staff is friendly and makes sure you get whatever you want, and the manager is present to see that things go as they should. Keegan's is a great place for lunch or dinner whether you are with friends, co workers, or a date. You can find me here quite frequently!"}
{"text":"Keegan's? More like Barf-gins.   The food: Low quality. Our wings came out completely charred, Brussels sprouts were slimy and gross, shrimp tacos were overly salted. Chicken came out in a side dish with blue liquid on the bottom (chicken and detergent?)  The service: Our waitress, Teresa, slammed our food down on the table and never came back to check in and see how things were. Our order was wrong. Teresa also didn't bother to acknowledge the fact that we literally barely touched half of what we ordered when she dropped the check and ran off."}
{"text":"Not too bad. It's a upscale sports bar.  Food is pretty good and they always have wine/drink specials.  Usually not many people in there.  I need to put this in rotation more often, maybe a lunch or pregame stop before going out one night."}
{"text":"Chance encounter on this little (well, maybe not soo little) gem of a place. Yelped it the moment I passed by it because of all the cars present in their parking lot. Although there are only 8 reviews for the place, what people had to say about it really made me want to visit.   Was well greeted on a spontaneous adventure to the restaurant for dinner. The bar was packed so my party decided to get seated in the main dining area. Got seated right away and was introduced to our server in no time. Think she had to swallow a chill pill or something because it took some time for her to be nice (most likely the main reason im not giving this place 5 stars)  The menu was pretty reasonable. Starters dont exceed $10 and entrees range anywhere from $5-$15 (If Im correct, there is only one item on the menu costing $15)   We started off with three appetizers, thinking it would be the only dishes ordered (little did we know):  - Grilled Spicy Chicken Wings: Some a little burnt but it tasted great. The portions are large and seasoning just right (or too bland depending on what you prefer). I liked that it was grilled, less of that greasy hell overwhelming the taste of the actual meat.  - Homemade lemon garlic Hummus with pita : sooo delicious. It was only about $6, it comes with a bunch of pita. My party of 4 shared it and still had left overs =] definitely recommended.  - Cheeseburger Sliders x3 on Egg Bun: The bun is delicious! and the meat is perfectly cooked (medium) and seasoned. The perfect balance of meat, bun, and cheese. Comes with diced pickles.  We were having a jolly time when all of a sudden someone notices a dish being served to the the table next to us. It looked so good, she decided to order it herself. We ended up sharing the Half Chicken entree and I was extremely impressed with how it came out.  The chicken is juicy and tender the entire way through. No parts of the chicken dry, every bite was well savored and just...mmm mmm mm Came with two sides (we chose the green beans/onions and mashed potatoes): green beans weren't my favorite, they were overcooked but the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked, tasted so fresh. They don't use a ton of butter or sour cream which was favorable to my taste buds.   Would definitely come again  FYI:  happy hour 3-6:30 pm. From what I could make out on the menu written in chalk: Half off appetizers and three 5.5 oz of draft beer for $5 (normally $6 for 3 - 5 oz beer sampler) oh and something about $5 wine"}
{"text":"This place has a nice social hour menu. Different varieties of drinks and appetizers ranging from $5-7.5. Nice friendly female waitresses, different ethnicities, nice to see variations. Gives you free cookies and has a nice shaded patio area."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Toma and good eats! Love this place! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Thai salmon salad was pretty good. Sweet, but good. The service was great. Fun little atmosphere, but seems like it's for an older crowd. The design inside is pretty cool and I like their giant front door. I only came for lunch, but the salad and fries were great."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch for $7 plus tax & tip that wasn't really heavy and tasted great. The sevice was friendly; the place looks great inside kind of feels like a restaurant sports grill mix.  They didn't have a lot of TV's in the dinning room so I guess you can only watch games in bar area which was limited on space."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a business lunch meeting, the food is great, services is fast, prices are ok.  One of these days I'm going to hang-out here for a few hours and have a few beers."}
{"text":"in the interest of full disclosure, i have a seventeen-year old son named KEEGAN. no relation but it was that and the great service that kept me from giving this place two stars.  the manager worked the dining room, running plates from the kitchen, visiting guests and generally overseeing things. MERCEDES, our server, was attentive. the hostess (usually the most useless person in any restaurant) was not only gracious and welcoming, she buzzed around busing tables and wiping down the drink station when she wasn't greeting folks at the door.   on saturday night there was mostly an older crowd (read geriatric) and by by 7:30 when we finished dinner the place had pretty much emptied out.  we ordered GREY GOOSE martinis and if we actually got GREY GOOSE (or any other premium vodka) i'd be shocked.  the THAI COBB SALAD (very clever name) was okay but not remotely THAI. hate it when the sous chef leaves six inch stems on the spinach. the \"spicy lime dressing\" was drab. there were sunflower seeds instead of peanuts and lots and lots of dried cranberries (cranberries ??). did it occur to anybody to throw in some cilantro ?? i appreciate a little poetic license as much as the next guy but come on ...  the wife's ONION SOUP was (again) just okay. the soup itself was bland and the caramelized onion flavor very poorly developed.   the kid's CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS were overcooked and the fries old and soggy.   the MUD PIE my wife and i ordered for desert looked awfully good. i didn't get to try any. it's arrival set off such a feeding frenzy between my wife and daughter, i was afraid to stick a spoon in for fear of losing a finger.  all and all, not a great dining experience.  as far as dinner goes, i would say the bar and kitchen let the front of the house down with bad recipes and poor execution."}
{"text":"Excellent menu selection and choice of many beers.  Full bar, great food and friendly service.  One of our favorite places for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We love Keegan's, especially for happy hour!  Grilled wings and sangria are our go to."}
{"text":"It's not a place where young people hang out, which is why we come here after a hectic day. The food and drinks are good. They have daily & monthly food special and seafood dishes. The service is also good."}
{"text":"I knew of Keegan's from long ago when a frequent biltmore guest I used to work for went there during every stay. They were 80+ so I always figured I wouldn't like it. While missing a Suns game, which is something I never do, I decided to drop into Keegan's for some grub and some ball on tee vee.  First off, service was slow and indifferent. I had to ask for the game to be turned on several times. Finally when I was about to walk across the street to Donovan's, they turned it on. Problem is they turned it on a TV across the bar that I couldn't see... really? Food came slow, nobody came back to check on me, and my glass of iced tea sat empty most of the night.   Menu actually had some non old people selections. I went for the Filet Strogonoff, which was delightful. two healthy pieces of filet with egg noodles, mushrooms, and gravy. I found it to be quite enjoyable, and would have liked the steak alone as well (something I didn't expect) as it was extremely tender and carried a nice seasoning with rosemary.  Yeah, the atmosphere was total old people. It seemed like a great place to go at like 10am on a sunday to watch the final round of a golf tournament. Lots of blue hairs there as well, and at 25 I was probably half the age of the next youngest person. It feels like a low end steakhouse. Lots of dark woods, bronze, and greens. Like a 1970's golf clubhous, which is ok, but definitely not for everyone."}
{"text":"Dark, quiet, cool and comfortable. Not the place to go for excitement. It's not a young energetic atmosphere. No, this is a place for the grown-ups to sit around and enjoy a clubby type atmosphere. It's relaxing.  The happy hour specials are good, and extend through whatever football game happens to be on.  I had the \"Son of MOAB\": A large hamburger on an egg bread roll. Not a bad deal at $6 for the combo."}
{"text":"I love going anywhere I'm the youngest one in the joint. Okay, not the youngest, but the youngest customer. Keegan's is a great neighborhood restaurant that puts out honest pub grub. No fancy, deconstructed shit here. You want potato skins, you got it! You want saffron dusted potato croquettes with bacon infused butter? Go somewhere else fancy boy!! They have a wide range of items on the menu and their specials are always worth the visit. Meatloaf day is one of the better ones! Just like Mom's.   My list of favs 1. Beer (I know you can get that anywhere, but I like the bar here, great bartenders) 2. Potato Skins (Duh, I talked about them earlier) 3. Calihan Cobb (Basically took a couple meats and mixed it in with some greens. Nothing wrong with that) 4. Turkey Burger (Better than Delux, need I say more) 5. Any of their cobblers   On St. Paddy's day they put up a strong corned beef! Just a wee bit of info for ya."}
{"text":"Keegan's is one of the very best places to eat in Chandler. Very good food with excellent atmosphere compared to other restaurants in southeast valley. They are crowded especially on weekends. Most foods homemade. Monday's meatloaf is special. Nice size sports bar included. Outside patio eating is very pleasant with fire pit and water mist.  Servers are super friendly and management are eager to please. Dont miss Keegan's in Chandler.. Go before 6pm to avoid the crowd. :-)  Thank You Keegan's Chandler Az . Your the best. We love the new decor changes. :-)"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food lacked flavor. It wasn't inedible, though. I ordered the French dip with a side of sweet potato fries. The other people in my party seemed to feel the same way about it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday, and were seated right away. Service was friendly and the beer/wine list is great. Unfortunately, the food was just ok. I ordered the stroganoff, and the steak was very good, but the pasta was too heavily sauced and lacked seasoning. My boyfriend's chicken mediera also lacked salt/seasoning. May come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food and good drink specials. Try the Firecracker shrimp appetizer and Huckleberry Margarita, really good!!! Good idea after hiking Camelback mountain.... Friendly, pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and both times was not anywhere close to \"wow-ed\" by the food.  The first time I got their meat loaf and tonight I got their chicken fried steak.  The portion size of the meatloaf was stingy.  The chicken fried steak had zero flavor.  For dessert we had peach cobbler and that was delicious, but it's hard to give more than two stars based on nothing more than a tasty dessert."}
{"text":"The service has been awful  since this place opened.  Have not been in a really long time.  Just stopped for a beer.  The bar tender did not even say hi when I came in.  Let me sit for awhile,  cleared some spots from people that left and then looked at me and waited on new people that just walked in the door!  Ugh..  It's like the Charlie Brown, Lucy and the football.  Nothing changes.  I left."}
{"text":"If I could afford it, I would come here every day and order their blackened salmon salad.  Roasted Corn & Red Bell Pepper Salsa, Edamame Beans, Tomatoes & Multigrain Tortilla Chips with a balsamic dressing.  My absolute favorite, hands down, and it pairs well with their arnold palmer."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood restaurant. Use to go there about once a week. Usually order the taproom steak with the string beans & basil tomatoes. Last time I went to my surprise they no longer have there delicious string beans that they sauteed with mushrooms & onions, instead they had flavorless steamed broccoli. I asked the waitress why they no longer had them she didn't know but said a lot people were complaining. also my steak was dry & overcooked. My husband ordered the fish & chips but usually orders an extra piece of fish when he is really hungry because the portion is on the skimpy side although tasty."}
{"text":"Our new fave hang out spot in PHX!  We came here TWICE this past weekend after finding such a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere with great food and friendly service in Arcadia.  Keegan's is nothing special.. you'd never take a first date here to woo them or come here for a fancy schmancy dinner, but that is perhaps what makes it so charming.   We sat at the bar on both occasions and realized very quick that the bar is a straight up mecca for regulars. Folks would walk in, grab a seat, and the bartender would know them by name and often, what meal they'd be ordering.   We struck up conversation with an older couple the first night only to find them there again the next night! If that doesn't attest to the place being a \"regular\" spot, then I don't know what does. We were the youngest in the restaurant by about a solid 30 years..however, we're an old retired couple at heart, so we fit right in.  Food: I've only had their wings and potato skins. Both were pretty dang good bar food, but my nod goes to the potato skins. They're super crispy (without being overdone) and I love the cheesy, bacon-y topping. I've also tried their carrot cake - the cream cheese frosting is pretty off the chain (I think thats what the kids say these days) :)  Service: Amazing! Kyle (bartender on Sundays) seemed to know what I needed before I could ask. Our wings came out with Ranch, he quickly caught the error and replaced with blue cheese. I suddenly realized we were missing Salt and Pepper..next thing i knew it appeared in front of us. He also didn't let a drink go empty the entire time we were there all while serving tons of other folks...good eye!   We can't wait to come here again soon, very soon!"}
{"text":"Always great food and nice atmosphere, love to sit at the bar with the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Use to go to lunch @ the one on Camelback near Biltmore area... Anyways, its been a few years.. like 15 or so :p,,   Tried this place out finally again. Place is VERY clean and friendly staff. I mainly came here for the Flour tortilla chips, but that wasnt on the appetizer menu anymore, so we ventured out anyways..   Fish Tacos with firecracker or dynamite shrimp were friggin AWESOME . The only downer was the ehh tortilla, but all the rest of the ingredients were fabulous.. Got them 2 times so far..   Cheese dip with choriza was pretty good, wish they came with more flour chips thou,, but still VERY good.   Ohhh and the Green Chili MAC n CHEESE was spot on, one the best Mac n Cheeses I have had at a restaurant..  Wife had the soup n Sandwich lunch combo and that was very good also,,, Soup was very flavorable, without the hint of anything canned or frozen..   Went back last week and had those Tacos again and a bowl of Clam Chowder.. WOW, from New England / Boston, I am very picky on Clam Chowder, and this place is probably my 2nd FAVE now for their Clam Chowder.. Great work,,,, Will be coming her few times a month for sure now..  AND TOP IT ALL OFF ...... 20. thats right , 20 Beers on TAP !! including , you guessed it Kiltlifter !"}
{"text":"Their small plate: Petite grilled salmon with Korean gochujang glaze was absolutely delicious.  I'll return there just to eat again."}
{"text":"Pretty Average Pub Food here, with a normal boring beer list - nothing to really stand out at all -  The ribs are very average, with the cheesy potatoes being fine, if coming out a bit tepid  I would certainly not recommend it, based on this meal and looking at the menu I would guess if you do not have adventurous tastes and a bud light palate you will be happy here - If you are looking for something more than average American cuisine - move on"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars but it will get 4 for its reverse happy hour that starts at 8 pm and plays host to some very well priced food and drink options.  While I have yet to have a full meal off their regular menu, what I have tried from their HH menu is enough to keep Keegan's on the list of viable options we have going in this neck of the woods.   A personal favorite among us are the potato skins as well as the hummus.    The mood here is clean and casual.  There are tvs available to watch the current sporting event and a full service bar.  Or have a seat in one of their spacious booths."}
{"text":"Amazing! Got their Saturday special lobster tail and steak served with cheese potatoes (that I changed to fries) and grilled parmesan tomatoes. Yum!!!! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The reverse happy hour was cool. I ended up getting a little drunk here. The waitress was nice to deal with. The open faced filet sandwich was great. I can't really remember much else about it. The beer selection was alright. If I lived around here I would be a creepy regular and hit on the attractive wait staff."}
{"text":"Popped in to Keegan's for burger. I'd heard their 25 year anniversary was around the corner. (Also, I was ready to chew my arm off after my first long canal bike ride.) Our timing was impeccable as we arrived during Social Hour.   Drink and food specials abound at the bar and patio area. Additionally (!) an NFL game was playing. Do I care about football? No. Why did I perk up watching the pig skin fly? There's a $6 Burger Menu(!) (Also available on NFL Sundays. At Noon.)  Dinner burgers normally run $10.95-$12.95. $6 was a steal! (That and my date treated. Shh.) The MOAB Burger is a meaty size, generously layered with double pepperjack cheese and caramelized onions. It's almost a sin to remove the onion knot bun as you lose the dijon aioli kick. (So I ate half. Again, shh.) I was a wee bit sad that my medium rare request came out very well done. However, I was hAngry. So I ate it. All of it.  I nibbled on these firecracker shrimp things. (There really wasn't any room in my belly. However, I was prodded into trying it. Just one bite.) I'm about to give you the virtual \"look\".   You should try this.  Calories be damn. It's clearly battered deep fried shrimp. However, the selling point on this appetizer is the chipotle aioli. Heavenly gooey stuff.

{"text":"Went in and ate during lunch a couple weeks ago, the staff is very friendly and we got our lunch very quickly. Got the vanilla creme brûlée for dessert and fell in love, it was the perfect size and very filling. The next two times I craved creme brûlée I called and made it for pick up because the first time it was so great! When I got home the first time, the portion was a lot smaller than in restaurant but was still delicious. The second time however, I opened the creme brûlée and it was almost pure liquid and I took a bite and it tasted like PIZZA. I was informed that they don't even serve pizza so it doesn't make sense why it would taste so disgusting. :( I gave Keegan's 3 stars because their actual food is good but I will never go back due to the creme brûlée crisis."}
{"text":"I've been going here for more than 10 years and this place used to be awesome, but unfortunately since it changed ownership, the service and ambience has deteriorated greatly."}
{"text":"A quick lunch on the go Keegan's Grill offers sandwiches, salads and burgers. I was limited time and let the waitress know. She was great on getting order out promptly. The Cobb salad was enough for two. Their portions are good size to split."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the food and service are always solid.  My lunch the other day was their Dagwood sandwich which was excellent.  I kinda like the place better before the remodel, and it is very nice but I like the dark wood look."}
{"text":"My son and I have been eating at Keegans several times a week for the last several years. The waitresses, and bartenders are fantastic.  Once you come a few times and order the same things they will remember and ask if you would like it again. The happy hour is fantastic from the pricing to the food choices. After a long day, we will either come in for hh or stop for a nice dinner. The choices for dinner on the menu are quite good or the revolving weekly specials are wonderful as well. I can't not have cup a cake for dessert it is the perfect way to end the night. I highly recommend Keegans and hope you give them a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Really just an average restaurant. I came here mid-week around the start of happy hour and the place was dead. We got served quickly and the food came out fast, but I'd really have to say that everything was just average. Not bad, but I'd also probably never come back unless someone else suggested it.  I had the clam chowder (a risk in AZ, I know, but it wasn't terrible) and the tuna sandwich. Perhaps there are better items on the menu that I missed out on..."}
{"text":"No soup for you! ...or at least that how we felt when George was banned by the Soup Nazi...what did we do to deserve this kind of treatment?  Twice, the take out service left out part of our order, and when ya get home questioning the high price, anyway, you at least expect to get what you ordered. Oh ya, the food is good, but let's put it in the bag! It should be simple enough, \"No more stars for you\"!!"}
{"text":"I really like Keegan's.  It is a friendly, homey place that seems like it's been in the neighborhood forever, yet has a relaxed, modern vibe that is nice to be around.  I've been there three times now, each time for business (interview) lunches.  The food is solid and tasty, and the menu varied enough that I can find most anything I want to eat without fearing that if I made the recommendation that a picky eater wouldn't be able to enjoy it either.    The staff is attentive without being intrusive, and you can eat at your own pace - fast or slow - and they take their cues from you.    NOTE:  They get really busy at lunch so either come early (11:15/11:30 am) or later (1:00 pm - ish) to get a seat easily.  The restaurant/bar is easy walking distance for several of the businesses in the area, so I suspect it gets a lot of regulars.  What was interesting is that I was treated like a \"regular\" the first time I walked in the door.  NICE.  I really enjoy their daily special soups (which are non-standard fare) and salads (Keegan Cobb, Special Caesar Salad), burger (Smoked Jalapeno Bacon Burger - VERY GOOD and Juicy) and indulged in the Cuppa Cake dessert, which is especially yummy.    The price for two people at lunch with soup, salad and beverage apiece was less than $18 with tip.  VERY Reasonable for such a great place to be."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places for the nachos, which are still the best I've ever had. Then they took them off the menu. After that, I just did not have the heart to come back. The service is a little questionable too, if they get even a little busy. The last time I went, we waited 20 minutes before just giving up."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with an upscale sports bar feel to it. Have a decent selection of beers n happy hour daily. Interesting location n crowd."}
{"text":"This place has stood the test of time. I've been coming for years. I wouldn't say I am a regular, mostly because the service is mediocre. So you never really know how your visit will turn out. The food is good. I can say they don't seem to change up the menu really. But they do offer daily specials and have a great decor inside. There is ample seating, it's always clean and cozy. The outside fire pit on the patio is one of my favorite spots in the cold months. They serve Guinness and Jameson so until that stops, they are one of my \"go-to\" spots for dinner!"}
{"text":"Tired of the loud and over-crowded bars and clubs? Tired of over-hearing the stupidest conversations known to man? Tired of people who give a rat's ass about their waist size and designer shoes?   Allow me to introduce you to Keegans.   So many spots around the Valley will be crowded, loud, filled with obnoxious people. When you feel like going out but not battling your way in the door or fighting for a table, consider Keegans.   Even on a Friday evening, there's plenty of room for you.   I can't vouch for their food, though the menu offers some pretty appealing sandwiches, burgers, salads and apps.   Best of all, I like the laid back atmosphere of their patio. Sure, it shares itself with a parking lot, basically, that grants you a view of busy Camelback Road or the hustle of Delux. But, while people are zipping in and out of traffic or waiting at least an hour for a seat, you relax without a care in the world. In a way, you're flippin' the finger to all those prissy pansies who think cramming into Delux for dinner is an ideal way to waste a night away.   Try the Sundog Amber Wheat. They have this chilled and ready for you. It's a damn fine wheat beer, if you ask me. (Definitely a new fave.)  When I'm in the mood to go out but to still be removed from the annoyances of people, I'll return to Keegans. It gets my seal of approval.   After all, what a novel concept: I can hear what my companion is saying!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals! Even on the weekend which is a perk.  Place was absolutely empty when we were there. Never sure how places like that stay open.  Server was nice.  Food was okay- not bad not impressive.  Yummy drinks.   Overall, id go back for hh."}
{"text":"What's not to say in a positive way about this long established neighborhood bar where the kitchen consistently offers dependably tasty treats?  My particular favorite..the steak sandwich with the Gorgonzola cheese...never fails to please.  Friendly and attentive service and a creative group of line chefs..plus rarely having to wait to be seated either inside or out..make this one a worthy stop in your Arcadia gastronomic venture. Kudos to co-owner Ramsey Clark for maintaining a top notch bar and quality focused kitchen."}
{"text":"So after my review I was contacted by Keegan's, they said they were looking into adding a veggie burger to the menu and would I stop by and try it out prior? It was great, nice and tasty, grilled well and held together nicely :) Talk about great customer service....thank you John at Keegan's!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this neighborhood spot! Great happy hour prices.  Really good food - not your average bar food.  Had ribs and Mac and cheese (so good!) spicy shrimp app was tasty.  Good service and enjoyed the music when we were there.  Good mix of people and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood place.  Nothing fancy, just a good place to have some wings and bear."}
{"text":"Last Sunday was my first time visiting Keegans Restaurant. Had low expectations, but food was amazing and the service was outstanding! The Russian girl Toma gave me great food recommendations. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Keegan's is a Phoenix establishment that I've been patronizing since I was 7 (as a guest of my folks, of course). Today, it's my favorite place to grab a burger and and brew on game day. The wait staff is top notch (and the bartender Brad has a really cute butt, but you didn't hear it from me ;) and I would recommend it for locals and visitors alike. Keegan's=your favorite neighborhood bar and grill."}
{"text":"Service was very good, albeit the server had tables on the patio and on the opposite side of the bar.  So while not the servers fault it took a while for the server to show at the table.  Onion soup pretty good.  For the price (add on to the meal) it was real good.  Fish and chips were good, albeit one of the pieces of fish still had the blood line in it...so a little fishy tasting.  Pot roast  was good.  Dessert  was a peach/berry cobbler.  Server said it was small...it was as advertised.  Having said, that it turned out to be enough to share.    Overall very good."}
