{"text":"Average food overall, pretty lousy prices. For Italian food you could do worse, but you could also do a whole of a lot better. Pizza is expensive but tasty. Dinner's were over prices and i think i could make the same thing at home pretty cheap"}
{"text":"Their food is consistent, that's for sure.  You're not gonna get a super fancy meal but you're not gonna pay for it either.  The food here is better than some of the nearby \"upscale\" Italian places too, without the attitude and price.  What I get most often (2 times a month or more) is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  SOLID.  It's a staple for events and people coming over.  When friends from outta town visit they often request it."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I go here.  It gets busy but never more than a 10 to 15 minute wait.  They have a bar if you don't want to sit at a table.  Decent beer and wine selection.  Nothing crazy.  They make homemade soups.  I'm a fan of the wedding.  If I'm there for pizza then the antipasta salad is a must.  Their house italian is one of my favorites.  For the most part I believe the salad dressing are also homemade.  They have great pizza.  Either square or round.  They have specialty pizzas, great calzones, hoagies  and an array of pasta dishes.  If you venture here you and your wallet will happy customers."}
{"text":"My family, coworkers and I have been getting food and would LOVE to dine at this establishment.  Their fried zucchini is awesome and their italian subs I've been known to crave.  Food quality aside, a recent trip with my out-of-town sister-in-law, brother, their 3 very small children (2,4,6 years of age) and my mother was horrible.  Our waitress was likely a newbie, and I always have the utmost respect and patience for new employees and green waitresses (we all have to start somewhere!).  My sister-in-law has a strict diet for herself and her children and requested no fries for their kids' meals.  As the food arrived, there were fries on all of the kids' plates.  We inquired as to why and the waitress said \"well, they're free with the meal, so we gave them to them anyhow!\".... :/  Then my sister-in-law's salad was completely incorrect.  When she informed the waitress it wasn't what she ordered, the waitress said \"I can take it back\" and my SIL decided she would pick off what she didn't want.  After the waitress left, she realized the task of removing things from her salad was too much of a task.  The busboy took the dish back to the kitchen as per our request.  The waitress finally returned and my SIL requested the salad be taken off of our bill.  The waitress said that she couldn't because she didn't personally see the returned salad.  She then SCOLDED my SIL and said \"Next time, you should send the salad back immediately\"... Finally, after our meal, with terrible service (the waitress never returned to check on us), I received our bill that had a 20% gratuity added to the final bill.  I walked up to the hostess and requested I speak with the manager.  The manager said that parties greater than 8 people would have 20% gratuity added.  Since when are 3 small children part of a party greater than 8 people???  I told her that if I felt the waitress earned 20%, I would happily tip that (which I usually do).  She did not earn 20%.  I wanted to only tip 10%.  The manager looked at me and scolded me with a \"Next time, be prepared that a party of 8 people has 20% gratuity added\".  I kindly informed her there would never be a \"Next time\".  While I waited for the new bill at the front of the restaurant, the waitress returned to tell my family (without me present), that she didn't earn a tip, so feel free not to tip her.  ???  Wow.  As we left the restaurant, after I paid with my 10% tip, the manager and all of the staff lined up along a wall and scowled at us as we left.  The NEXT TIME I want to eat a high school cafeteria, I'll be sure to tip my waitress as per her service."}
{"text":"The is nothing Italian about this place. The tomato base sauces are either bland or acidic. Pasta chokes everything else in the dish. The so-called speciality pizza is horrid pool of greasy cheese-like product that you can't taste any other topping on it. Yes, it is a consistent cheap selection of terrible cooking, whether you go to their Milvale or to Cranberry branches."}
{"text":"I go here maybe 1 a month. When I do go they have great service. They also have a magician that sometimes comes. I highly recommend this place for people wanting Italian"}
{"text":"For a red sauce joint, this place is good. A great option for a non-chain restaurant on the North Hills."}
{"text":"This restaurant is THE Italian restaurant to go to. Try the calzones or pizza and you can not go wrong. Make this your next pizza visit."}
{"text":"First our server Amber B. Was AWESOME!! Very attentive, quick and super nice! All of our meals, apps, soups and salads were great. My only slight complaint was the hostess wasn't very friendly, the hostess is the first person who greets you when you walk through that door, they must be happy to see you & everyone that walks in there. There was also a couple seated behind us that ended up leaving after they sat for 15 minutes without any service at all. Not sure whose fault that is but In my restaurant it is my hostesses job to let my servers know that thats their table. But other than that My family had a great time. Thank You"}
{"text":"Every time I get take-out it is wrong and when I call to say it is wrong they suggest I look at the order before I leave. So I'm supposed to open every bag and box in the middle of the waiting area because the restaurant manager doesn't want to train the employees to take ownership of 1. Taking an order correctly 2. Verifying the order is correct before they take it out of the kitchen. That is excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The best i had so far no complaints..been there a least twenty times i keep misplacing my punch card for a free pizza though...and the pizza is consistent and goood..the waitress is very helpful.. no hesitation providing tip.. give the pie a try.."}
{"text":"Good food. We mostly order out and get the pizza more than anything else. Nothing too special but solid, good food."}
{"text":"We stopped at Monte Cello's for a late lunch. Our waitress was very nice and patient with the kids in our party. I had the chicken sandwich, but as a wrap. The chicken was cooked nicely, although there was not too much in the actual wrap. The fries were delicious with a nice crisp texture. There were a lot of fries, so I took mot of them home. My daughter thought her sliders were a little dry, while my mom really enjoyed the bbq chicken wrap."}
{"text":"After driving by here every day, I thought I would give the lunch buffet a try.  I guess it was my mistake to go at 1:30, but I was disappointed.  I understand that eating a later buffet with hardly anyone in there does not mean all the food will be the freshest, but the pizza was very dry and cold.  The hot foods were still decent and they had pasta with meatballs, pierogies, chicken pot pie, buffalo shrimp, scalloped potatoes to go along with soup and a salad bar.  It had potential, but for $10 was not worth some of the food being dried out.    That being said, i will probably try it again for take out, so at least I know the food is fresh.  Being new to Pittsburgh, I clump this restaurant into the many restaurants that seem like people just eat there because their parents or grandparents did even though it isn't as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Great food.  But we had a SUPER Server Amber. She gave us just the attention we needed.. noted that my wifes  steak wrap was not cooked medium as ordered and offered to make it right.  refills of coffee and pop when needed without asking. Nice music on the sound system.  clean friendly relaxing. we liked it. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Website says open till 10:00 pm.  My wife and I arrive at approximately 9:30 pm.  We are told you're closed.  Signs and website say you're open until 10:00.  Also you doors were unlocked. If you're closed you need to lock the doors,  I've worked in the business as a night shift manager and I'm open until my doors are physically locked.  If someone walked in to my open doors I always served them, that's how I was trained and that's how I ran things.  Look at your menu burgers, hoagies, pizzas, etc 80% of which take under 10 minutes to make.  Your staff didn't even offer to make us a carry out order, for example a cold sub so you don't even need to turn back on a grill."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for dinner or lunch. We love the waitress Amber!!  Never disappoints.  If there is a problem she always makes sure to make it right.  Problems are very rare.  Food is very tasty and fulfilling.  The whole staff is always friendly.  I go there a lot because it is VETERAN owned.  If you've never been there, you have to try it!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The wait staff very attentive.  We ordered a buffalo Chicken pizza, stuffed eggplant parm, and hot wings. The food was average.   The way people rave about this place I was really expecting to have an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, great warm atmosphere and never a long wait. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a solid go to restaurant when we want something quick or are having pizza cravings. Their weekday lunch buffet is pretty decent-salad section, then hot foods and usually 3 types of pizza- their buffalo chicken pizza is outstanding. They all around have great salads and pasta . I've also had my baby shower and my daughter's first birthday party in their event room. Food and service were always great."}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken Pizza?  Are you serious?  Yes, you have to try it.  Monte Cello's is one of those local hangouts that everybody goes to.  It's always busy, but the service is usually fast, and the food is consistently good.  They don't deliver, but I usually see several people by the door who are doing a pickup.  This is a great place to meet friends for food and conversation.  Their previous location on McKnight Road posed parking issues, so this newer location is a little more out of sight, but a lot easier to park and get in and out.  Affordable, consistently excellent, and lots of fun!"}
{"text":"First time there last night. It was amazing. 45 min wait for two but we hung out at the bar & enjoyed ourselves. Through the yelp waitlist we knew how long it would be until we were sat which we LOVE. Waitress was awesome funny and personable.   Highly recommend coming here for date night, you won't be disappointed.   Omg and try their Conley cookie."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered takeout here Saturday night as we wanted something different from the places we usually order. We both love Sicilian style pizza and thought we would give theirs a try.   We went with a large antipasti salad with their house made Italian dressing and a large Sicilian pizza with sausage and olives. The salad was fresh and was really good. The dressing was a bit oily, but overall really tasty. Pizza was excellent...great dough and crust and solid toppings. We will definitely be ordering from here again...a bit pricey at almost 40.00, but we definitely had tons of leftovers, which are nothing to complain about.   The takeout process itself was fairly painless, especially for a busy Saturday night, but the young girls who were working behind the counter and who answer the phones, prep the takeout orders, and interact with customers who are waiting were mostly rude painfully adolescent. A lot of eye rolling and complaining at the front desk about having too many orders or how long their shifts were.   The food coming out of the kitchen looked good -  so I will definitely be back to try more! All in all, not a bad impression for a fist time experience!"}
{"text":"So a woman walks into a restaurant and asks for a wedgie!  And she's dressed in her finest business wear!  Plus she orders Italian Wedding Soup to go along with her wedgie.  Now that I've planted THAT image in your mind, for those of you who don't know, a wedgie is a stuffed folded dough shell.  I ordered the tuna wedgie and it was very filling, but oh so good.  Definitely a bit different from the usual hoagie.  As for Monte Cello's, it's about the best of the pizza/Italian joints around."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant in sooo long and last night was my first night back. Super disappointed with how terrible the service was... Our server didn't come to our table until 20 mins after we had been sat, then we waited another 10-15 mins just to receive them... Finally after waiting almost 45 mins to receive a drink, she took our order and within a few mins they brought out our salads. After that, not once did she come back for another 45 mins at least to see if we needed more drinks or anything! I had to wave down a host just to ask her to get our waitress because we needed more drinks and it was clear that she was not worried about us. So honestly at this point we were overly frustrated and annoyed. After all that, we waited and hour and a half for our food. The food was pretty good, the pasta sauce was average at best. Really had high hopes since it had been such a long time since I had been there and it was an honest disaster... don't know if I would even go back after that experience."}
{"text":"I had not been here for many years due to not being in this area of town. Tried the Wedding soup and was very disappointed. It was nothing special and not as good as I remembered. The crab ravioli, I would not recommend. The pasta was very tough and crab tasted like it came from an old can and very poor seafood taste. While my wife had the sausage casserole was good. The only reason the review did not get a lower bark, was that the service was very good."}
{"text":"I took a group of residents from a local personal care home and Elizabeth our waitress went above and beyond in taking care of us.  The entire staff was so accommodating, pleasant, and gracious.  The food was superb - everyone enjoyed their dishes so much - It was an excellent experience all around - I look forward to taking them out again!  We were all extremely pleased! (I am writing about the Pittsburgh Monte Cellos on McKnight Road)"}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop Italian restaurant. Pizza, hoagies and pasta are plentiful here. Great specials and their sauce is delicious. Great service, food and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Monte Cello's serves average-tasting Italian food. It's probably not going to wow you, but if you live close by, than it's a good option on days you don't feel like cooking. It's got a better atmosphere and staff than Olive Garden, and they use the No Wait app, which is convenient.   I normally stick with the ravioli. The wedding soup is pretty good too. Steer clear of the lava cake - it tastes like something your kid might pull out of their easy bake oven.   We've only had their pizza once, it was alright, once again, nothing special, but no complaints either. You always know what you're getting at Monte Cellos. The definition of a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"After visiting here a few times with my boyfriend and his family, it's good. It's one of those places that doesn't stand out. You'll say, it's a good solid choice, but there is nothing about it that makes it worth 4 stars. There is also nothing bad about it that makes it worth 2 stars. I've never had a bad experience here. (I just think maybe I'm giving too many 4 stars and I'm beginning to reevaluate  my life lol)   The pizza is good and the beer selection is nice. They have bottles too but I'm more of a draft beer kind of gal.   They have a nice little \"banquet\" area that I've also been to a few times. It's comfortable, small, but great for family get togethers or \"baptism\" lunches, things like that. The staff that have helped us in the banquet area are always so kind and patient. I guess you would have to be with the large group of people lol and the food was solid. Nothing too special, but good for buffet style food.   Lastly, sometimes they have a magician for the kids (and I'm sure the adults too) he's not like those creepy, hoakie, magicians you see sometimes. He's good and if you don't want him to come to your table, I think he can sense it and will not bother you. He remembers my boyfriend's nephew's  name and remembers his favorite  trick. It's cute!"}
{"text":"I cant believe i havent discovered this place until now! iTS SOO good! everything from dessert to appetizers to entrees this place was great.. we started at the bar and waited about 20 to be sat(on a fri night) the bar prices were awesome & they do have specials.. we got sat and order an appetizers right away, we got the fried provolone- which was excellent. Then we ordered our meals my boyfriend got the chicken parm, he was very full after and had some to take home. i got the stuffed shells, they were good! we also got cheesecake to take home- EXCELLENT and they brought the desserts out to you on a try to see which one you would like.. kinda different! overall i will return, and tell my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed Monte Cello's?  They're pizza is so good.  I think this particular location is my favorite, though I've eaten at probably 6 locations and had similar experiences at them all.    This location is BUSY, so order in advance, or be prepared to wait.  Clean, friendly service, great pizza.  The family \"go-to\" is the pepperoni and bacon.  It is divine.    The only real downside is that they don't deliver, though it's probably a blessing in disguise because I'd order it every other day.  Eating leftover bacon pepperoni from last night as I write this review.  Great place to catch the game in the bar area (which has restaurant seating...booths and tables as well as a more traditional bar) or get away from the idiot box on the restaurant side.  Private back room is ideal for surprise birthday parties (since I just utilized it for my daughter's 15th).    Parking is often a bit of a chore.  They keep paving more and more of the area around the restaurant for parking, and still somehow fill the lot.  You might need to driver around a bit to find a good spot."}
{"text":"Mu husband and I love this place.  We have done take-out, dine in and I had a wedding shower for a girlfriend here.  It is a cute little italian restaraunt that offers a small bar and a party room.    The service is always out of this world.  The waiters and waitresses are always really nice, on top of everything, and keep my drink full.  We usually get pizza when we go and it is also great.  Even take-out the pizza is fantastic.  We have gotten buffalo fries there as well and they are never the same.  It depdnds on the cook.  This is the reason I gave them 4 stars.  I has a wedding shower for a girlfriend here and I couldn't have asked for anything more.  They dedicated one server to us which was plenty.  He was courteous of everyone that was there and provided friendly service.  The shower went off wihtout a hitch, food was delicious, service was great, and everyone enjoyed themselves.  We usually take our out of town guests here to have dinner as well.  They seem to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  They have alot of choices for dessert as well.  Some are homemade and others are purchased from the bakery, Oakmont I think, but they are all good.  They will tell you which ones are purchased from the bakery as well.  We would reccomend this place to everyone if you like italian food."}
{"text":"Long standing, Italian tradition.  Great food and good times."}
{"text":"Monte Cello's is a fine name for a restaurant!  We were hungry for pizza and  my friend suggested we go  here.  It was fairly busy for a Thursday night and I was told that on weekends it can get super crowded.  There were plenty of pizza options to consider but we chose the traditional pizza.  The table next to us chose the deep dish style and it looked like one very hearty pizza pie.  I think it  was even thicker and deeper then what you would expect to be served at an Uno's."}
{"text":"Decided to swing by Monte Cello's today for lunch.  I got an Italian hoagie and order of Provolone sticks to go.  The hoagie was very good, made on Mancini bread and loaded with quality ingredients.  The provolone sticks were also very good but I did not care for the marinara sauce, as I found it had an odd flavor.  In all it was really good, so I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"It was definitely a satisfactory meal, but I was expecting a little more. I don't know if they are owned by the same people who own the Allison Park and Babcock Bvd locations, but this was not what I was expecting after having been to the Babcock Bvd location last month. The dining area was very outdated and it had the vibe of a pick up pizza place rather than a sit down Italian family restaurant. It is definitely more popular as a pick up pizza place since people were constantly coming through the door to pick up their pizzas.  I might return if I am in the area again, I would definitely consider getting pizza here since it seems to be so popular with the locals."}
{"text":"Heading back to Pittsburgh-proper from the Ross Township mall, we decided we were ready to eat but didn't want to have to fight any of the holiday traffic surrounding the mall.  So, breaking out the handy-dandy iPhone application, we found Monte Cello's.  With only one review, it was a bit of a gambit, but we decided to get ourselves some Italian food.  When we arrived, the place was packed.  This is a VERY popular local business.  We arrived just in time for the Friday rush to be waning and we were sat in a booth after about a two-minute wait.  The place looked quite new and nice on the inside.  Our server was immediately at our table and taking our drink and appetizer order:  Italian Wedding Soup Provolone sticks Meatballs Unsweet Tea with lemon Pepsi  Our drinks were on the table immediately as was the soup.  The Italian Wedding soup is some of the best that I have tried in the entire Pittsburgh area and I had no qualms finishing it.  My issue was trying to figure out what I was going to have for dinner.  Was I going to order an entree, or were we going to share a pizza.  As our appetizers arrived, we opted to try the pizza before delving into anything more complex.  We ordered:  Bread and butter 12\" pepperoni pizza with extra cheese  The meatballs and the cheese sticks were anticlimactic after having had the Wedding soup.  The meatballs were average as were the cheese sticks.  We finished the appetizers and awaited the pizza with anticipation; not knowing if it would be more akin to the soup or the rest of the appetizers.  When the pizza arrived, we dug in immediately.  This was no Fiori's.  It was an average pizza, but it tasted better than much of the food that I had found in the area.  In the end, I counted ourselves lucky to find a restaurant that I would consider \"A-Ok\" and could return to when I am in the area of the mall."}
{"text":"Love Monte Cello's!  Very consistent and it is always pretty tasty.  It's a great place for family and friend get togethers with plenty of room for larger tables.  One half of the restaurant is more bar centered with multiple TVs, while the other half of the restaurant is more of a dining room with no TVs.  Some of my favorite menu items...Joe's Special pizza is delightful.  A thicker crust with a bit of a spicier sauce and extra cheese. Get it with mushrooms and you'll be so content and in a carb coma before you know it. Their salads are fresh, crisp, and their dressings are delish.  All of their hoagies are also great with quality ingredients, perfectly toasted bread, and large portions.  If you come during the week at lunch time, they have a lunch buffet which includes a salad bar, some hot food, and various pizzas.  They usually have a dessert pizza as well.  I think it's the best lunch buffet in the area and they really work hard at keeping the food fresh and loaded.  It is a buffet so the cheese on the pizza may not be quite hot and bubbling, but come on people, have some reasonable expectations.  The service is always friendly and quick.  With large groups the waitresses are quick to bring over pitchers of pop or iced tea so a glass is never empty.  Oops...I almost forgot dessert!  Two words. Hoho cake.  It's worth coming here for this.  Remember those lunch treats that as a kid you housed but now you feel them sticking to your hips as you eat them?  Well now it's in a CAKE version, and it's as delightful as you think it would be.  I believe they get their desserts from a local well known bakery and they definitely seem like they are right out of a bakery.  Try the Hoho cake.  And the carrot cake. And the german chocolate cake.  I think I'm drooling..."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant.  Everything I've tried was delicious!  Even my 83 year old Mom ate everything on her plate!  Anything is good!"}
{"text":"I can't give this place 5 stars just because of the amount of excellent pizza I have had. However, my family lives 2 minutes away and I have probably eaten here 100 times and every single time is good. The staff is very friendly and I've never ever had a problem with my order (which is almost always takeout)   I have had every hoagie and they're all fantastic. My mom's favorite is probably the steak while mine is the hot sausage.   The pizza is very good. The dough is fresh and the sauce is actual tomato sauce. I hate sweeter sauces and this one is definitely not one of those.   I would highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We sat near the bar area where the TV's are. It was clean and quiet. The guys at the bar were talking about football, it actually kept us entertained during lunch. Lol.  We ordered a large meatball and a large chicken & broccoli. The chicken broccoli was DELICIOUS. Best pizza I've had in a while. Meatball was nothing to write home about, but good anyway.  Nice kids meal options for our son, too.  Waiter was friendly and kept our drinks full. Couldn't ask for more at lunch time.  Prices are little high bu worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to Monte Cello's on Babcock more than a few times in the past 5 years, so it wouldn't be fair to review them on my last visit (which was this past Monday) but instead review them based on the sum total of all of my visits (which are many).  First things first: What I like:  1. Their Calzones are AMAZING. Definitely the best I've ever eaten. Not too saucy, not too small or dry, perfectly seasoned. I always opt for the meatball, and while I've usually had it with the usual meatball fillings (meatballs, a little sauce, ricotta and mozzarella cheese), this recent visit made me realize that you can add extras in it, and apparently it doesn't cost you any extra. I tried it with some pepperoni and extra cheese -- even though it was good, I will still just do mine plain. Also, I love the fact that they are filling enough (at least for me) that I can eat half there, and take half home the next day for lunch. Tip: if ordering the side of sauce (which does cost extra) and more than one person is doing the calzone, ONLY order one sauce. There is more than enough to share.  2. Which leads me to their side sauces. If you order a side of something (ranch, sauce, whatever) you get practically a BOWL full of it. It's almost bordering on too much...but hey...too much is better than not enough.  3. Pizza. They USED to have a special during Steeler games that you could order (during the game) a large cheese pizza for 7.99. They don't anymore. Hey, the economy, whatever. Their taco pizza is one serious pizza. Lots of meat, lots of cheese, lots of taco toppings. They aren't messing around. Get the jalapenos on the side, though. A little pricey on their pizzas, but they're really good. That's what Monte's is known for, mainly, is their pizza.  4. French fries. Crispy on the outside, fluffy and soft in the inside. Enough said.  Some *minor* gripes:  1. If eating in, try NOT to sit in the dining room by the bar. I have found service to be a little slower there. I prefer the other dining room, or take out.  2. The price is a little high, but on the other side, the quality is good.  General overall review: This is an all around great place to go. Go here."}
{"text":"I've never had a pizza at Monte Cello's that I didn't love!  Don't take my word for it.  My friend brought her Italian boyfriend who makes pasta and dough for his family's restaurant in Ancona.  They traveled throughout PA, both to Pittsburgh and Philly, and even went to NYC... and he said that Monte Cello's pizza was his favorite.  Pittsburgh was his favorite too :)  I'm not comparing Monte Cello's pizza to New York Pizza (or pizza from Italy for that matter).  It's totally different.  But, no matter where you're from or what kind of pizza you've had, you can't deny that Monte Cello's makes a stellar pie."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my family and I ordered pick up for 8 people. We got pizza, side salads, a fish sandwich, shrimp pasta, and a appetizer.   I called in around 530p (last minute dinner decision)   With a Lent Friday in Pittsburgh eateries with no meat options get pretty busy! I was prepared for a long wait but I have to say I was proven wrong.    The order was complete and picked up in under an hour. Not one item was missing and everything tastes great!   The parking lot was super busy and there was a line of people waiting to be seated but the staff was great and had everything packed up and ready to go about a minute after I paid.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Another great grace Methodist church dinner!  Wonderful food, service and fellowship!"}
{"text":"Excellent! So far I've just had the white pizza. The crust was flaky & flavorful and the cheese was top notch. Definitely will go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I always order food from this location, and it does not disappoint. We have dined in a few times, great staff, and the area is large inside (even though the parking lot looks like it's packed, there is a ton of room). Highly recommend any kind of their pizza, subs, or pasta! Recently had the pan pizza and the crust was amazing, very fresh and not burnt. Everything on the menu here is really good, and the variety helps as well. We have ordered the chicken wraps before (fries are a must), as well as the zucchini sticks, just to name a few that i hadn't named above. Love this location!"}
{"text":"A little better than average, which isn't bad.  Figured I'd give Monte Cello's a try since we are getting tired of our go to pizza spots.  Some people had recommended it and it meets my qualification of family owned and local.    *Warning* The review is limited to take out and pizza, we do plan on going back and having different grub off the menu, so I will update when we do.  The person answering the phone for take out was friendly and estimated the pick up time at 20 minutes.  I hate places that say 10 and it turns out to be 30 or visa versa.    The prices are reasonable, but not as cheap as some competitors, because of this their stuff should be better, but it isn't.  The pizza was well cooked, the crust is good.  A little bit of crunch yet it still had that chewy texture on the inside.  The sauce was the part I wasn't too keen on.  It was smooth, but a little too acidic and runny.  They didn't load up on the sauce however so it didn't bother me too much.  The toppings also were a little weak.  We ordered the Margherita pizza, a favorite of mine and something I always order if it's offered.  The menu pictures and the actual pizza look nothing alike.  The basil on the pizza was tiny and didn't have that fresh taste you'd expect.  The cheese was good, but was mostly mozzarella taste and again did not taste like good mozzarella.  They claim to put asiago on it as well, but I didn't taste it. Onto the garlic bread sticks.  They were too crunchy and tasted like a giant crouton, not impressed.  An average pizza Margherita and not very good bread sticks."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with tasty food. I've never been disappointed in 23 years! My Mom worked there when I was growing up, and their food is just as good as it was when I was 6. I've never had bad service, and Joe really cares about his customers. I love their pizza, and the hoho cake from Lincoln Bakery is a divine treat on occasion."}

{"text":"Stopped for take out because it is close to Camp Bow Wow, so it was convenient. They had our pizza ready to go. Yummy! The hubby got the Sicilian, thick crust and delicious! I chose the margarita and it was just terrific. Sweet with a little spice to their sauce. The only downside is it is a little tough to get in and out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Best Buffalo Chicken Pizza I've ever had!  Fantastic pizza all around!  Only downside is that they don't deliver."}
{"text":"I have never set foot in this place, although it looks nice from the outside.  What I have done on several occasions is eaten their pizza.  It is the best I have had in the area."}
