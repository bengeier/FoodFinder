{"text":"A friend and I went to Press this morning to enjoy a brunch beverage or two, ushered in by the mimosa bar sign adorning the outside wall. We entered and immediately took a moment to appreciate the fine decorations, cool bar features, and high ceilings - we were very visually pleased. For being a Saturday morning, we expected it to be a bit more crowded than it was, but who were we to complain about having the place mostly to ourselves? We took two seats at the bar and were just as quickly taken aback by our bartender/server. She slapped two menus down on the bar, skimped on a greeting (read: didn't give us the courtesy of making eye contact), and had a general air of displeasure about her. In her defense, she was manning the bar patrons alone; in mine, there were 4 other people present. We looked over the champagne-laden beverages and were impressed, we ended up ordering the blood orange mimosa and blueberry strawberry mimosa. After much huffing and puffing by our certifiably unhappy waitstaff, our drinks were in front of us. For brevity's sake, I will proclaim they were nothing short of awesome. The blood orange mimosa was a brightly colored pink-orange; neon but less intense. The blueberry was a darker color, with a strawberry on the rim. Both were very fruity, but still had enough champagne taste to warrant a 10/10 rating from this reviewer. Unfortunately, that is the only saving grace for this Yelp review, which otherwise would have received one star. Our antagonist went on to take/enter orders, make drinks, run food, and fritter about the establishment with scowl and disdain. It pained her to ask if we, or seemingly anyone else, needed anything. It was clear this was her world, and we were just living in it. How dare we paying customers enter an establishment and want things of her? Do we not KNOW who she is? The Queen shan't be bothered, so us plebeians cashed out and left at once.  Takeaways: our drinks were most delicious, but regretfully I will not be returning. If I were to consume enough of them to forget our bartender's miserable attitude (or the fact she never once troubled herself to smile at us), I would be comatose. I have never written a review for Yelp, but this single experience has compelled me enough to do so, so no other readers feel as unwelcome as I felt today. Truly a travesty considering the awesome decor, promising menu, and delicious drinks. Press, I expected better."}
{"text":"Kick-ass charcuterie board, amazing flatbread, incredible roasted chicken breast. Our smiley lil' cutie pie of a server (an absolute sweetheart) was totally on it with the refills, which,by my own admission, holds an inappropriate amount of importance for me. She also had our appetizers and entrees out quickly and was awesome about keeping the table clear of empty plates to make room for the next round of delicious. This, despite the fact that we were there at 8pm on a Friday night. A+ with extra credit."}
{"text":"NOT-im-PRESS-ed.        Where should I start?!? Half alive hostess....didn't know to seat us even though we stood at her \"stand\" for ten minutes. Food.... I wasnt sure what to even order. Finally got margarita pizza which literally (not being a drama queen or exaggerating) tasted like NOTHING. Server  didn't understand the wine list and also maybe saw us maybe two times.  Got the fried brussels...I would say (with agreement from co- eaters) taste like flaky overly buttered movie theater popcorn kernels. I don't know what to say. Would give them another chance, but shit, I don't know when."}
{"text":"Now I know this place isn't a steakhouse, but you'd think being in Tremont they'd be able to properly cook a steak. Besides being well done when I ordered medium rare; the service was very slow, and their menu was only half available.  On a positive note they have a great bar selection.  My suggestion, go to any other restaurant in the area before stopping here."}
{"text":"Press is lucky it's on a cute corner in a thriving neighborhood because the food is definitely not worth going out of your way to find.  The wine and cheese are all good, but how can you screw up a nice bottle of wine and imported cheeses?  Serving the quality products of other people (at a high mark-up) doesn't make it a good restaurant.   We had two glasses of wine, two small salads, and two flatbreads, and it was over $60.00.  This was way too much to pay for a mediocre meal.   I got the roasted tomato flatbread which had no tomatoes and instead came with undercooked eggplant and a basic BBQ sauce.  I guess the fact that it had tomato sauce and smoky BBQ sauce made it a smoked tomato?  The calculus didn't quite compute for me on that one.  BBQ plus tomato plus bad eggplant = smoked tomato?  Press is a great place to people watch or enjoy a drink, but don't come for dinner.  It's really expensive and so underwhelming that you'll wish you just waited for a table across the street at Lolita."}
{"text":"Just popping in to update my last view. We just used Press to have my graduation party (50 people) and they knocked it out of the  park. Front of the house was perfect. Our open was at 4:00 and by 3:45 the space was 100% ready  to go. The front of the house manager and two servers were a head of the game and  gave the impression that this was not their first rodeo.  Through out the three hour event I never had a problem with drinks, service or bussing. Back of the house kept our taco bar fresh and our flat bread bar in perfect rotation.  If you are reading this review contemplating having a large event, listen up. This restaurant is where you should send your business. If you want a turn key event with no surprises this is your bet on Professor Avenue. Our contact was Sean, I believe he is the GM."}
{"text":"We went for brunch this past weekend and OMG.  It was fantastic.    There were four of us and we couldn't decide on which flatbread to share so we got two!  The breakfast one has butternut squash, goat cheese and a poached egg and holy cow was that amazing! My boyfriend hates squash and even he liked it.  The only thing that would make it better is the presentation of the egg, there was only one poached egg on the whole thing so it either needed more or it needs to be cut up and evenly distributed. We also got the bacon flatbread, it had carmelized onions and blue cheese.  It was good, but I don't like blue cheese so I tried it but focused on the amazingness that was the squash one.  By the time we ate the flatbreads I was getting pretty full but we had also ordered entrees...needless to say I didn't eat dinner lol I got the skillet and it was very tasty, a bit smaller portion than I was expecting but that was totally fine because I wasn't really hungry by the time that it came.  It had homefries, onions and peppers and warm goat cheese. mmmmm I LOVE GOAT CHEESE if you hadn't noticed.  The boy got the crab benedict and I didn't hear a peep out of him from the time it arrived until he devoured it, so he loved it. Our friends split the skillet that I got and the french toast.  They concurred with me on the skillet and I heard a lot of \"mmmmm\"s about the french toast.  I just had water and coffee but was very tempted by the yummy brunch cocktail menu...I'm in grad school and had to do homework and study afterwards, but next time...MIMOSA KIT!  Note - we sat inside bc the pollen count was like a million but I checked out the patio and it was really cute.  Definitely a must try for a brunch spot."}
{"text":"They have a great wine selection here! I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place as well. Also, I wasn't overly thrilled with there flatbread. It needed more sauce or even sauce drizzled on top like most places usually do. The mussels I had were REALLY good however. There patio looked really nice but was too busy and didn't want to wait to eat. I will be heading back to this place again."}
{"text":"Went to Press for brunch on Saturday while spending some time in Cleveland. Great atmosphere, terrific service and had a good Bloody Mary. Ordered the Crab Benedict as this dish is a favorite of mine. However this one was underwhelming, no lumps of crabmeat present and served on a muffin that was not toasted. Will be back though as this seems like a great spot, just will order something else the next time."}
{"text":"Obviously they have a huge selection of wine. Okay now that that's out of the way.  I had the mussels and shared the meat and cheese plate. Both were decent, but not really mind blowing hence the wishy washy 3 stars.  There were some other things on the menu that sounded worth a try in the future... if I was feeling very motivated."}
{"text":"Press seemed like a great addition to the neighborhood and for a drink and an app it is! However, the 2 stars come from a recent Brunch experience. While our waitress was great, the food was just ok and figuring out the bill was a nightmare. The prices that are listed on the menu for the pancakes are not what was rang up, and it took over 20 minutes to try and get that fixed as well as get the bill split evenly among 3 people, which can be a pain but shouldn't be that hard.  Also, after checking my online banking I noticed that I was charged twice. Stick with the wine, everything else is a waste of time."}
{"text":"A long overdue review........ my brother and sis in law brought us here for a tasting dinner.  Chef Matt's dad and my brother went to school together.  I am a total food person.  I am a professional cook and live for dining out and experiencing good food anywhere I go.  This dinner was one of my top five dinners of all time.  If you want a true treat, let Chef Matt cook for you.  Just let him cook.  Although much of what we had was on the menu, I can tell you that anything that comes out of his kitchen is going to be delicious."}
{"text":"Wine and Dessert?  Yes. Please. Thank you for delivering my two favorite food groups straight to me face. Press delivered on all fronts. The place was clearly busy, but we were seated right away and our service was impeccable, even though we were only in for a few drinks and dessert. He was friendly, out-going, and knowledgable about wine. Our water glasses were always full, and the fancier drinks kept coming. The espresso cheesecake with fruit compote was shut. the. front. door. good. I'll absolutely be going back to taste my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Just got done with dinner at the press had the braised beef short ribs with smoked polenta was kick ass to bad it's not on the mine menu was here for my nephew wedding reception had a great time"}
{"text":"I have to update my review to five stars.  I have come here quite a few more times, and am more impressed each time.  I usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders are very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I had a crab benedict for brunch the other day that was absolutely delicious, and a chicken flatbread that was also great.  Last time I went to Press, I arrived just before 5 and it seemed like the bartender and manager had just arrived.  Rather than act snotty and like I was inconveniencing them, as I have found at some places, they were inviting and friendly.  The employees here treat the customers well, which is icing on the cake to the great food and wine."}
{"text":"I came into Press with my boyfriend Saturday night and sat at the bar. It was extremely busy. The bartenders greeted us with a smile they were very friendly and helpful. I had a glass of Prosecco, that our bartender recommended she swore by it. Which I'm glad she did. My boyfriend got the Manhattan off the drink menu, also recommended by the bartender. (She was very helpful.) Both were tasty and made quickly even with the high volume in the restaurant. I ordered a burger, very flavorful! The aioli was to die for. My boyfriend got the beef shoulder. I, of course, ate off his plate. I'm not sure which item I liked more. The shoulder was so tender and flavorful.  I'll definitely be back to press next time I'm in Tremont."}
{"text":"I went here last night and tried 3 things. two of them were very bad and one was just ok. Worst thing was the fact my sandwich had stalebread! I wont be back here!"}
{"text":"We visited Press with another couple right after Thanksgiving and were really pleased when we walked and and saw the cozy atmosphere.  We ordered some fancy drinks and appetizers (cheese board, deviled eggs) and they could be classified as \"fine\", although I could have put together better apps at home.  That's the upside part of this review...Our service was ok.  We sat in the back room off the patio which is pretty but cold.  We asked the server if they could start up wth fireplace and she indicated she go get someone but no one ever came.  Everyone in our party ordered either a crab  burger or regular burger and we were all disappointed.  The crab cake was complete mush and the burgers were extremely greasy and nothing special (tip:  Stone Mad by the Detriot Shoreway has a great burger).  When I told the server that the crab burger was mush, she went and checked with the kitchen and came back saying it had been in fact made properly.  Huh?  If Press is going to continue to exist next door to Barrio and across the street from Lolita (great food, great service, great everything!) they will need to step up their foodie game.  Being the baby of Southside and Rocky River Wine Bar you think this place would be a winner hands down...not so much.  Overall our dining experience was forgettable.  Given the fact that there are lots of other amazing places with food and drink in CLE, we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Walked into this place with family and was happy with the friendly service and super yummy food. Beef stroganoff was on point but the highlight of the night was the bacon honey flatbread  definitely will be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Hey, you gotta hand it to the owner, it takes balls to open a place across from Lolita, the first restaurant of the now mighty Cleveland oracle Michael Symon. Given the juxtaposition, it makes dismissing this place that much easier, unfortunately. I came here for brunch, and while I didn't leave disgruntled, I also did not leave especially satisfied.   There's nothing glaringly wrong with this place. The décor is the now common Cleveland rustic industrial casual chic; think wooden barrels, long minimalist bars, wrought lron light fixtures and dark subdued color palette. The food is the now common smaller menu of seasonally inspired stick to your ribs fare.   The menu will doubtless contain the obligatory shout outs to: pork belly, kale, house marinated olives (side note: why is this such a trend?? Olives are like bread; if you're going to serve them in a restaurant they should be free), duck confit (this time going for the bar cliché double whammy and putting it on a flatbread) and overpriced burger.   The execution of said foods is pedestrian, as in the ingredients don't mesh any better than if you threw them all together into a pot and told them to pipe down and get along. Many dishes are a few steps from greatness:  too salty, or a tad greasy (as in the case of my breakfast tacos), or a tad bland (ditto on the breakfast tacos), or in the case of the sauce on my pancakes a tad too tart.    TLDR; Overall, if you want good wine, good atmosphere, or good food, try across the street at Lolita first. If you're one of the many refugees who couldn't snag a seat at the bar fast enough at Lolita and are now drifting about Tremont lost and hungry, I would say walk down to Dante's or Fahrenheit, but this place will work passably well."}
{"text":"My in laws just hosted our rehearsal dinner at Press Wine Bar and I am here to tell you it was absolutely PERFECT! If anyone is looking for a venue to host a dinner party, event, or whatever the case may be, please consider Press. Shaun is the coordinator and he went above and beyond to make the planning process so much fun, and the food was perfection! We live in Tremont so we dine here often, but I wanted it noted somewhere on Yelp that Press is the best!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for the weekend and stopped in here on a whim while exploring the Tremont neighborhood. It was around 4:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday and there were just a handful of folks in the place. The weather was beautiful, but we skipped the outdoor seating and opted for a spot at the bar.  We were greeted by the bartender and my husband ordered a craft beer and I went with my usual chardonney. There was a nice selection of reasonably priced beer and wine options (full bar too).  The menu looked great, but we were planning on dinner somewhere else so we just had an appetizer. The fried risotto and mozzarella (aka arancini) was delicious. The portion was large with three golf-ball sized arancini filled with perfect cooked risotto and creamy mozzarella. They were fried crisp and then finished with a drizzle of balsamic and micro greens.  We stayed for a second drink and then headed out. Reasonably priced with our table around $30 for three drinks and appetizer.  The only thing that kept it from a five-star rating was that the staff didn't seem very friendly. The hostesses seemed to be in their own little world congregating around the hostess stand and our bartender was more interested in chatting up what appeared to be a couple of regulars there rather than checking in with us.  All in all, positive experience - absolutely loved the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"They decor was nice, but that is where the compliments stop. The service was okay, the staff seemed pretty unprepared and wasn't very capable of handling out party as well as the rest of the restaurant. We were told they ran out of beef and French fries. Almost every order that was prepared was cooked to the wrong temperature. Lastly the menu that appears online was not the same menu they had in store. Overall it was a pretty bad experience except the  servers seemed pretty nice."}
{"text":"Went here for a social event so I don't know how credible this review will be...wine menu is decent.  Nice selection of domestics and internationals.  Food (cheese and meat board, flatbreads) was very tasty.  Service was good.  I have heard the brunch is great so I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a big fan good drinks and even more of a fan of patios and Press combines the best of both worlds. The first time I stopped with a few girlfriends we shared the Mimosa Kit and it was perfect Sunday Morning stop. The most recent visit didn't disappoint, I stopped for a quick happy hour with a girlfriend and ended up spending 3 hours on their patio. The Happy hour menu is limited but the Margarita flatbread is quite tasty and enough to share.  I am always on the lookout for great patios and I would say that this place has earned its rank."}
{"text":"Under NEW owners? Maybe...at least the food quality can tell me so.. NOT as good brunch as it used to be.. Quality has gone down south! Hopefully they change soon or..... Won't be back for A while..."}
{"text":"The Press Wine Bar was the center of an enjoyable food and wine tasting experience this past Thursday, August 13, 2015.  This was our first visit, but won't be the last.  The atmosphere was relaxed, and friendly.  The service by the staff was unobtrusive, courteous and professional.  We would highly recommend the Press  Wine Bar, and we look forward to our next visit.  John, the owner and his staff go out of their way to ensure the customers are taken care of.  Much appreciated.    Great wine, great food.    Tim and DeLacy  Hudson, Ohio"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here killing time so I might as well write a Yelp review, right?  I'm sipping on their happy hour tempranillo and it's delicious!  $5 happy hour for select wines from 4-7pm and $3 select draft beers and a $5 weekly inspired cocktail, whatever that means.  They also have what appears to be a tasty happy hour menu but I've not tried any of the food...although I should probably partake in an alcohol absorbing flatbread or veggie empanadas (both $5).  It's a cute location and lots of tables.  Their patio is also dog-friendly!  I can't bring my crazy dog here though...he's nuts and would likely chase people away from this awesome wine bar.  It's my second time coming here and I'm sure there will be a third!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch at around 10:15 a.m. on a Sunday before the crowds hit (and they did, at around 11:30 a.m.). I tried several of their mimosas, but found the spiked pear mimosa to be my favorite of the bunch. We started with the squash flatbread, which was delicious. I'd order it again as my main brunch dish, that or any of their flatbreads given the quality of this one.  The breakfast tacos were completely flavorless, however. Served with chorizo and eggs (both cold), the cheese sprinkled on (also cold, not melted), and an under-seasoned pico de gallo, these required copious amounts of hot sauce to be palatable. I felt bad for other patrons when I saw these coming by our table...just not good.  Seeing as we only had two dishes: one a success and one a complete flop, I'd have to try Press again at brunch to really pass final judgement on my opinion of their food offerings. We'll likely give it another try, especially since their mimosas are so good (they even have a mimosa kit!), and hope we make a better selection.  One final note: this place has strange acoustics and can get fairly loud at around noon. Not the best if/when you're nursing a headache from Saturday night's festivities...perhaps a mimosa will help. :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps when I am not pregnant I will love this place but for now it's just a 3 star. Surely down the road the wine can push it up to a 4, maybe!   My husband and I stopped in around 4:30/5:00, a pretty slow time, maybe 4 or 5 people at the bar including us. It took the bartender a good 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. That kind of service continued through the evening. My husbands wine glass was quick to refill, my coke, remained empty. Ordering food took forever and she even took the order of the guy next to us despite him arriving a good 15 minutes after us. Check also took forever. Just slow all around.  Food: meh. I had the chicken risotto and for nearly $20 was boring and lacked flavor. Also just way to have for a spring/summer dish. Fall dish? Perfect. Deviled eggs were delish though!   I'll be back, definitely when I can enjoy some wine and the mimosa cart!"}
{"text":"First things first.. I hate wine. There. I said it. I'm not going to pretend that I have the palette to go wine tasting, or the stomach for ti for that matter, but I do know when something tastes good and that Rule 1 Cab ( you know the one so good they just put it on tap!!) gets two thumbs up from me.    Caught the NCAAB opener a few weeks back and make small talk with a few people at the bar. It was a good time. I ended up ordering a burger. The Press burger. Soo good. I'll be sure to stop in for this more often. I live near by but have never thought much about this place. I'm certainly glad a little article I read suggested I check them out. Rachael Spieth? You did it again. I'm a believer. Red Dragon cheese & smoked tomato aioli shoot this burger to the front of the pack. Just don't tell the Lolita burger I said that. She's the jealous type."}
{"text":"Relaxed and energizing all at the same time. A perfectly balanced atmosphere. Friendly and efficient bartenders. Ambient setting with practical lighting. This is a place that makes you feel good. I could spend some time here and will definitely return with friends."}
{"text":"This place has great dining spaces all around; indoors bar area is nice, the front patio w umbrellas well spaced and the garden back patio is the best on the too sunny of days. The host was accommodating when seating us after we requested a shady table. The waitress was not as helpful when asked about the top sellers.Basically named the whole menu and even when narrowed it down only said \"both good\". Dishes were good! A Benedict w/ beef (very good)and a mexican skillet (just good) were ordered. The mimosa was a little weak yet there selection of mimosas is Amazing!! I think your better off ordering their \"mimosa kit\" and just preppin them oneself."}
{"text":"I was looking for some place to have mimosa's on a nice saturday morning. I googled mimosa and this place came up. Its somewhat pricey but the atmosphere was very nice and laid back. i didnt eat but plan to go back and try this place out one more time."}
{"text":"So...... drinks and app's!  All good, cute place in a great area!   My friend was drinking an expensive scotch and noticed that the glass was filthy.  They took it away and brought him the same scotch in a clean glass...... really?  I'm sure there was enough alcohol content to kill anything living but how about a fresh pour?  Which happened when I asked.  Our served handled everything very well and was very nice but the bar staff dropped the ball on this one."}
{"text":"BRUNCH! Stopped at Press with girlfriends over the summer. Loved the experience. The food as fresh and the menu had many different items to choose from. I got the vegetable skillet and it was amazing. Potatoes on the bottom, eggs on top, mixed with fresh veggies and sprinkled with melted cheese on top. We of course could not pass up the Mimosa Kit. $35 for a bottle of champagne, 4 different juices and fresh fruit!"}
{"text":"I've been to Press several times now, for brunch and dinner and I have had a different experience every time I go. The first time I went for dinner,  I went towards the end of happy hour and had a glass of Pinot Noir and shared a flat-bread pizza with my friend. I thoroughly enjoyed the wine, however I wasn't blown away by the flat-bread, and the service was slow, so I wasn't able to grab another glass of wine before the happy hour ended.  The next few times I came here for brunch and I must say, the Mimosa Kit is one of the best ideas I've seen at a restaurant! You get a whole bottle of champagne and 4 or 5 different types of juices and fruit to create your own mimosa! So clever and delicious! However the breakfast/lunch options are not the best.  I believe that they change the menu quite often (or at least in the past month, every time I've gone they have changed several items). The first time I got a cheese omelet which had a variety of different cheeses on it. It was bland and the blue cheese was extremely overpowering. The next time I got a grilled cheese meal which was actually very tasty but small. The last time I went I got an egg salad and smoked lox sandwich (which I've had before elsewhere and loved) - I really did not enjoy this sandwich. There was way too much lox and the egg salad was dry.   I will definitely be back here to enjoy and share the Mimosa Kit with my friends, but I don't think I'll be trying any more food here."}
{"text":"Sooooo my friends were passing through CLE via 90, en route to Vermont from Illinois.  I got the phone call \"Be here in two hours.  Can you find a spot that is convenient to get to from 90?\"  So I picked.....Lolita.  Except it's a Friday night.  Holiday weekend. No reservations available.  We decided to wing it and shoot for a first come/first serve spot at the bar.  No luck there either.    Now what? I KNOW!  Let's go to this wine bar across the street instead.  And so we did.  And what a find it was!!! None of us had wine, though.  My friends are from IL and NYC, and they had never tried Great Lakes Christmas Beer before, so I insisted that they must!     We started with the cheese and meat board.  It was the perfect size for four people and contained a very generous and well-thought selection of meats and cheeses.  The pickled radish and the cablanca were my favorite items on the plate. For my entree I had the Press Burger: Red dragon cheese, smoked tomato aioli, arugula, and sliced vidalia onion on a challah bun.  Mmmmm.......one of the better burgers I've had in awhile!  The only thing I would have done differently would have been to caramelize the onion, instead of serving it raw. (Don't get me wrong; I love onion.  But raw onions stay with me for days.) I also tasted my friend Holly's dish: Roasted Chicken Breast which consisted of sage and goat cheese risotto, roasted cauliflower, and mushroom madeira sauce.  Delectable.  The cauliflower had great flavor and the risotto simply melted in my mouth.    The decor was beautiful.  Exposed brick walls.  I think there was an old-fashioned butter churn at the bottom of the stairs, leading to the bathroom.  The bathroom sinks looked like wine barrels.   It was a cozy night and it was lightly snowing.  The cozy atmosphere at Press was absolutely perfect.  We decided that Tremont reminds us very much of a neighborhood in Brooklyn called Greenpoint.  A large Polish influence, a bunch of really cute pubs, shops, and restaurants, and a great selection of food.  The homes even look similar.  If you are famliar with Brooklyn, there also appears to be a park in Tremont similar to McCarren park.    Bottom line: I want to make this my new favorite spot. I have lived here since last spring and I don't have a \"favorite spot\" yet.  And I'd be hard-pressed not to pick Press!"}
{"text":"I just don't think the food here is very good. If you just want a drink then come here. But, some friends and I have gone here twice and had food that wasn't worth the price. I got the braised lamb shank risotto last time thinking I couldn't go wrong but I didn't even care to finish it. And the amount of lamb in it was pretty small."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner for a friends birthday.  They were extremely accommodating as far as a reservation  for a large group went (there were 15-20 of us there!). We got seated right away and always had our water glasses filled.  The wine selection was vast, and the \"wine on tap\" option was interesting.  I would like to come back for drinks sometime!   The food selection was pretty limited- salads, some flatbreads, and a few entrees were offered.  I was craving a burger, so that's what I ordered, and  I was not disappointed with my selection.  The meat was flavorful and I liked how the aoli worked with the cheese and onions.  The fries were the best part though... They are tossed in herbs and are perfectly cooked.  Everyone else seemed happy with their choices as well.  In addition to the small menu, I was also not very impressed with the speediness of the service.  Obviously there were many of us, but any time a server offered another glass of wine or a refill, it took 10-15 minutes to get it.  We also had to wait awhile for the bills after everyone was completely done with dinner.  Again, I understand it was Saturday night, but it was a much longer wait than I would expect even on a weekend.  I definitely wouldn't mind stopping in for a few glasses of wine again, but I would probably rather go somewhere else with more dinner options for my meal.  I've also heard great things bout brunch so I wouldn't mind trying that and hopefully upping the stars!"}
{"text":"I was between 2 & 3 stars for this review, so the bottom line is, it was eh- OK.  I went with a friend after work on a Thursday night.  We love wine bars and looked forward to trying Press.  It wasn't very busy, there was one other table when we arrived, and maybe a total of 5 when we left.  When we arrived, we ordered a bottle of wine and we had a meat and cheese board.  Our server, although relatively attentive, was just all around unpleasant.  I don't need to have banter or conversations with a server to be happy, but please don't appear annoyed to do your job.  At one point, we asked for a recommendation for a white, possibly bubbly, that was sweeter, not so dry.  We were told the owner did not like sweet wines, so he didn't carry them, but she would ask anyway.  I don't really care what the owner likes to drink, and a simple request seemed to really put her out.  I don't claim to be super knowledgeable about wines, I know what I like, don't etc.  I feel a wine bar, especially when not busy, should be open to educating and recommending wines for consumers and we definitely didn't get that vibe.  At the end of the night, we took our check up to the bar to cash out as our server had disappeared.  In the future, I will go back to Rocky River, Humble, etc.  There just wasn't anything about Press that stood out or makes me want to return."}
{"text":"Not a wine drinker myself, so can't speak to the vino selection. They had 4 microbrews on tap which I appreciated because many wine bars don't offer that. Inside was pretty cool and service was good. Didn't eat anything but dessert menu sounded yummy."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the bar experience because I came on a Friday night which I believe they stopped serving food. So I find this place used to be Lago and really liked that they opened this place up more. More space and patio dining. Inside is American contemporary with wooden tables and David the bartender did an exceptional job in preparing our drinks.  In the summer time, I believe the place would be a popular destination to be especially with their patio dining. You can people watch since it's in the corner of where all the other restaurants and nightlife are. I'd have to come back here to try their food."}
{"text":"This review is a toughy. I really want to like Press Wine Bar and give it a bazillion stars but Press fails to im\"press\" me. --- silly pun intended. I have only been here twice and will continue to visit because the ambiance is super cool. The oversized U-shaped bar is perfect for a group of four to five friends to belly up to and hold a conversation without shouting over each other. I really do like the setup and space. It reminds me of this really cool wine bar in the meatpacking district in NYC. Here's where Press get's a star knocked off.  Although the service could be great because the food arrives hot and speedy, the bartender I have had on both visits was totally unprofessional. In today's modern technology era it is totally acceptable to check text messages and play on your phone every now and again but it is best to be discreet about it. He was playing on his phone in front of the whole bar in between making drinks. It was a really bad type of playing on his phone. The kind of playing on his phone where that's all he did. I'm surprised he doesn't grasp the concept that bartending is 10% making drinks and 90% talking to guests.  I felt bad for the couple sitting next to us because they were really confused about the wine list and were the needy type that needs guidance when making selections. One of my friends who was sitting next to them turns to them and says something along the lines of, \"Hi, I'm sorry I overheard you guys trying to navigate the wine list. My friend Jesse is a connoisseur and can probably help you make a selection.\" She then has me switch seats with her so I could sit next to the couple. I was really annoyed because I had to get up and switch seats. Anyways they were really nice but just a little disappointed that the bartender recommended one of the red wines on tap (all domestics) when they said they something along the lines of a super tuscan or old world blend. Also they were interested in a bottle not glass pours. I told them that I have  tried the Chateauneuf Du Papa by Guigal before and they both agreed to get it and offer me  glass for helping them. Not sure why the guy behind the bar couldn't have helped them, Maybe he wasn't versed in the product being sold on the menu or he was too concerned with his smart phone. Anyways it was stupid of him for selling two glasses of $6-7 wine when his customers were looking for a higher end bottle ($70) to share.  In addition to the stellar ambiance, Press has some tasty treats and hearty eats from their well put together menu. The eggplant flatbread was so so good with the fresh oregano, ricotta, and olives. I could eat twelve of those on my next visit. Also we had the duck sausage, selections of cheeses,and a few entrees like char, a pumpkin pasta, and sirloin filet. Oh and this may seem kind of lame but the ceasar salad I had was probably one of the best I have eaten in a very long time. It may sound simple but the dressing was bright and lemony so it complimented the salty mild white anchovies and crisp raddicchio and lettuce. It would have been nice to have some silverware placed in front of us. Once we got his attention we were able to request utensils.    I really like Press and will visit again. Hopefully the bar service will improve by being more attentive."}
{"text":"Went to Press for brunch on a date. I am a big fan of Tremont restaurants, and although I was a bit disappointed with the food here, I have to say the trend of great establishments in the Tremont neighborhood continues for me. I had the crab benedict and the mango mimosa. The mimosa was one of the more delicious things I have drunk in a while, and was only one of many great-looking things on that brunch drink menu. I would highly recommend choosing this as a brunch destination because of the quiet, quaint atmosphere, and...well, drinking champagne mid-day...how can you beat that? The crab benedict was fairly good, although nowhere near the best I've ever had. I couldn't really make out the sriracha in the hollandiase sauce, which may or may not have been a good thing, but was what drew me to ordering the dish in the first place. My date ordered a skillet which I noticed was burnt in a couple of spots, something which definitely should not have been sent out as is."}
{"text":"this is a pretty solid 3 right now, although i truly believe they have the potential to be a 5. i hope i am right, because i will be back there on monday for happy hour and hope to update my review then. what went wrong you ask? the service. i literally stood at the door for 10 minutes before someone came up to me, and then i think only because my friend had arrived just then. two different girls came up to the group at the table closest to the door to give them their checks, and looked right over me. it wasn't that busy. i know i'm pretty short, but i thought i had become invisible! i also saw several bartenders behind the bar who also failed to notice me at all. the girl who did finally come over to seat us was nice, apologized, and later said she would take off the first drink, but she continued to make the whole experience kind of awkward, such as not actually taking that drink off the check. oy...  ok on to the food and drink. my compadre got the passion fruit mimosa, which was delicious, and i had the mango mary. i made the mistake of sipping through the straw instead of drinking from the glass with the salt rim which i only realized at the end. together we shared the shroom omelette and the tomato skillet, and bbq fries. the eggs were solid and the cheese they paired on each was really good. the hash was nothing exceptional, but i did really enjoy the fries. there's a ton of other things on the menu that look great that i want to try. maybe next time someone will actually take notice of me when i walk in the door though. yeah that would be nice.."}
{"text":"Trendy on the corner of Literary and Professor. We just missed Brunch, but the menu looked incredible!  Delighted with the Prussian burger topped with Cleveland sauerkraut, sliced kielbasa, and swiss cheese. Spicy peppers too!   An Italian sausage and pepercini bianco pizza ... Nicely prepared with perfect crust.  Lastly, a Vesper made with cucumber vodka was the perfect dessert!  Yes, they had a limited selections of desserts, but the Vesper was the best choice!  If you like alcohol, they have a very cool list of each type of alcohol, each wine and beer.  Craft cocktails and martinis as well.  I really recommend this place if you want to people watch or catch some sun!"}
{"text":"Great selection of share-able plates  Decent draft beer selection  Above average outdoor space for Tremont  Good for people watching  A little pricey  Will likely go again"}
{"text":"Stopped here a while back. The experience was amazing. It was a Monday night and the place was quiet with a few tables scattered around. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and were surprised to learn that their happy hour was until 7!  We ordered some happy hour Cabernets which were great for the price, and some happy hour snacks. I believe we had the mussels and the fondue. Both were super delicious. Next We ordered the meat and cheese board and this far surpassed our expectations! It was HUGE and delicious and we certainly will come back just for that! It had generous portions and great accompaniments. For entrees we ordered the short rib risotto and crab and mascarpone fish. All were amazing. The bottle wine selection was extensive and reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I picked out a lovely bottle to enjoy with our meals.   The service was Great. Andy was our bartender and he was knowledgable and friendly. Other servers came Over to talk to us and it was nice that everyone was so friendly!   We will definitely be back and I can't wait to try the brunch menu! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Thought i would give press another shot and my experience was definitely better. Our server was very professional and prompt. The goat cheese dip was outstanding. We were all fighting for the last piece. My mother got some sort of pumpkin pasta and after giving it a try she had to keep fighting my fork away. I got a black bean sandwich. Wasn't anything outstanding. Kind of just tasted like only black beans. Maybe a slaw or corn relish would bump up the flavor. The salad it came with was delicious. Very refreshing. Happy hour wine prices were very reasonable. I'm glad I tried press out again."}
{"text":"After finding out that Press Wine Bar has a new Chef, my friend and I decided to enjoy an evening dinning there during my last trip to Cleveland. We opted for a five course menu tasting and got a sneak peek at the new cocktail menu.  Simply put, the food was refreshing. The Chef behind Press has the right idea and I really appreciated his keen palate.   We started with a salad consisting of perfect circles of watermelon, tomatoes and watercress. It was finished off with lime zest and sumac. The combination of the sweet watermelon against the sumac and lime was dazzling. This salad was a great start and I'll be adding lime and sumac to my watermelon from now on!   Our second course was Maryland oysters. Who comes to Cleveland and finds oysters this tasty? We did! Two perfectly shucked and presented oysters topped off with smoked buttermilk and caviar. The smokiness the buttermilk created in this \"bite\" brought oysters to an entirely new level for me. My experience is usually with an acidic sauce or something spicy like horseradish, but the smoky flavor was unbeatable. The caviar was a nice addition both flavor wise and in presentation.  The third course was a Nori Capellini in a delicious sauce that was both creamy and light. My favorite part of this dish was the kohlrabi (root vegetable, really good raw with a little bit of salt and lemon juice . . . try it!) It may not have been intended to be the superstar of this dish, but it was for me! The salmon roe and candied orange completed the perfect bite, the roe giving a nice amount of saltiness. I am pretty sure we could have eaten our weight in this dish!   Side note: During our meal we ordered a cocktail that was hand crafted by Chad our server and I will guess the bartender as well.  It was the best accompaniment to our meal. It is called the Gingersnap and I won't divulge all the ingredients (I want you to be surprised when you have it!) but it was light and at the same time full of flavor. The cinnamon made it feel like fall, the amaretto gave it the sweetness and the berry acai was the perfect twist!   Fourth course and my favorite, duck! The duck was plated to perfection, clean and enticing. It lounged on a plum puree with a smoky vanilla flavor, corn and sunchoke (a new one for me!) succotash and topped with crispy duck skin and marigold petals. Every single bite of this dish was spectacular. The duck skin was everything you would expect, the duck itself was cooked flawlessly and the accompaniments of the puree and succotash were well thought out and played together impeccably.   Our last course (don't worry, we had dessert!) was a bistro filet, which would be a shoulder cut. . . I'll admit I had to look that up! Lol!  It came with green onion soubise and a Yukon gold potato confit. I probably could have eaten the filet by itself and without a knife. It was that tasty! However what is a filet without its friends? This was a perfect end to the savory portion of our meal.   And dessert! Peanut panna cotta, Valrhona chocolate, mango infused with lime (please teach me to do that!) and a bit of spice.   To end the evening we had one more hand crafted cocktail called the Last Ride. And that my friend is what it was! It was charming with a nice kick of black pepper.   Our entire meal was stellar. The atmosphere, the service, the food and the cocktails were a pairing to delight anyone. You haven't eaten in Cleveland if you haven't been to Press and let Matt Spinner cook for you!"}
{"text":"Warm and inviting ambience! Super friendly and knowledgeable staff -Caitlin has served me several times and she is great! Nice wine and beer selection!! Based on these three things I would give it five stars!   Dinner menu, meh! I'm just never totally satisfied here. I feel like the dinner menu is boring and needs more options; nothing ever sticks out to me. This past time around I settled on the bisque and a side of fries. It was creamy, delicious, had some nice large chunks of shellfish and was simply presented. However the portion you got for the price of $10 was not worth it; basically a cup of soup in a huge bowl. The fries were perfectly crispy and served with some interesting sauces but unseasoned.   I really want to love this place, as I love wine and live steps away, but it just always misses the mark for me. Every time I've come here, it has been to meet other groups of people. With so many options for incredible food in Tremont I would probably just come here for a glass of nice wine vs spending the cash to eat in the future."}
{"text":"went last week for happy hour, which starts at 430pm : ) ordered risotto balls, mussels, eggplant flatbread and sampled the tap wines (going green).  they have a set of whites and red served at perfect temperature. the renovations inside are beautiful.  only con is that the building still smells odd???"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Press Wine Bar is their wine on tap. It's the newest thing that wine bars have started doing to reduce waste by eliminating bottles, corks, labeling, etc. Wineries are able to make quality wine, in larger qualities and sell it for a lower price...genius! I had the house salad which was dressed perfectly and was very fresh. I also had the smoked chicken flatbread with corn, black beans, crème fraiche, and cheddar cheese. It was fantastic!! I am excited to have discovered Press and I look forward to going there again to try different things on their menu."}
{"text":"You know, it's funny--I've heard more about the brunch here than anything else. So that's what I came for and it was, in fact, a great spot for brunch.   However, what about the fact that Press is indeed a wine bar? I really don't hear much about their non-brunch offerings, which I fear will hurt this place. But enough with that--let's focus on my brunch for a minute.   The drink menu for brunch is 5 stars, easy. Mmmmyes, passion fruit mimosa. But seriously, there are like almost 10 different mimosa options, plus there's a cart you can order for $35 that lets you \"decorate your own.\" The only bad side to it is that you get only one bottle of bubbly. In the mood for a savory cocktail? Their bloody mary offerings are badass. My guy ordered one that had a deviled egg and bacon in it. My sis got one with a stuffed pepper. My sister's bf said the coffee was pretty darn good, but I was too busy guzzling my mimosa.   The food is about a 3.5 for me. They offer up a lot unique brunch choices, but almost every option had 1-2 ingredients that I didn't like. What I really wanted was a traditional  brunch, so what I ordered was their shroom omelet (the closest thing to it.) What came out was a very plain looking omelet with wheat toast. Boy was I mistaken about the eggs--although simply prepared, the dish was eggcellent! HA! Seriously though, fluffy eggs, melty provolone, peppery arugula (I know... I'm over it too, but it was delicious) and the best mushrooms I've had in a long, long time. The wheat toast was darn good, too, although I like mine a little bit toastier. I could have done without the cold potatoes, which needed to be crispier.  I think the prices could come down a dollar or two, but overall, a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Always come here for wine, had never tried the food until recently. Had the braised pork strozapretti pasta, I enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying more of the menu. I'd say the food was a solid 3.5, but the service was outstanding! Our waitress was very kind and patient with us as we continued to mix up our wine choices.  How sad that patio season is over. That definitely added to our enjoyment, but it will not stop me from warming up with some wine in the winter here. Press made for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service (bar and food) when they weren't crowded. Order your next drink as soon as you're served the first drink. (Not kidding). Food was ok. Had the sweet spicy chicken thighs with rice. The chicken was delicious but not too much sweet or spice: a little bland but still a good flavor. Friend had beef stroganoff and it was delicious.  Beautiful decor. If they can't step up their timing and flow they are going to be in trouble when RNC rolls into town. So sad...."}
{"text":"The environment is so warm, making you feel that you're cozied up drinking wine by your fire place. I got the flight and it was a great deal for good wines."}
{"text":"Undercooked chicken wings. I would avoid unless you're looking to get ill. Disappointed. Service was nice, but quality of food was poor in my experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for brunch and the food for brunch is amazing. My friends and I had a hard time choosing what we wanted because everything looked good. The first time I was here I got the ham and egg croissant sandwich and last time I got the crab cake Benedict. Both make me wanting to go back. The brunch drink menu is also great. They have a large selection of different mimosas and bloody Mary's. The only down negative to my last visit was the service. It was fairly empty when we got there and it was so slow and then it got more crowds and got worse. I love the food and drinks so I'll keep coming back, but the service was a huge negative."}
{"text":"Press is a great place! We went in there with a group of 14 and they were VERY accommodating. The wine list is pretty legit and they have some great beers on tap that seem to change often. The food was not my favorite. I felt it was a little pricy for what they gave you. They also did not have many options. We had a flatbread, the Press burger, some calamari and a few drinks and the bill was creeping up towards $60. It all tasted pretty good, I would just prefer some cheaper options.   We got there just as happy hour was ending and that looked great! Some really good deals until 7pm. Next time I go we are hitting up the happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've stopped here a few times and always have had a great experience. The same owner owns Rocky River Wine Bar and Farinheit! The flatbreads are delicious. They offer a wide variety of beer and wine. I've heard great things about Brunch, can't wait to check it out."}
{"text":"I love this quaint little Wine Bar. The decor is classy, the staff very friendly and they have a huge selection of wines to choose from. Their house wines are even great! This is definitely a must-try but especially in warm weather. They have a small patio in front and a larger one around the back."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, creative but not weird menu, and great service.  I've only been here for Brunch, and it definitely holds its own in the competitive Tremont brunch crowd.  This past time I had the Lobster skillet.  Scrambled eggs with lobster chunks (yum!) and asparagus served over hash browns with a heft serving of hollandaise sauce all on top.  I had the pear mimosa, and coming from someone who doesn't really like Mimosas, I thought this one was delicious and refreshing!  Mimosas are really the thing that make this restaurant different from all the other brunch places.  They have every flavor of mimosa and they feature make your own mimosas and Bloody Mary options.  Have I said \"mimosa\" enough?  Let me say it just one more time.  Mimosas :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and dinner and drinks and it's a very solid establishment. The food is good (nothing too special) and the drinks are nice (great selection of breakfast cocktails). I really like the atmosphere- it's a mature lively bunch and has never been too crowded when I've been there."}
{"text":"Located in Tremont, Press is typically a wine bar, but also does an incredible brunch. Don't dismiss them because of their name!  Their brunch cocktail list is an A+. It's safe to say they have a cocktail wizard who has this brunch thing on lock. I've never had a more perfect Bloody Mary in my life! To make it better, they have at least four different bloodies to choose from!  Our brunch was excellent. The crab cake benedict was tender, filling and fresh. With a side of potatoes and fruit, it was the perfect brunch. My friend and I could not have left with better expectations met on the food and drink side! We're already talking about returning! It was also a great place for conversation, amongst the beautifully decorated wine bar and heaping natural light.  The only reason I can't give Press five stars, though it hurts, is the service. From the moment we walked in, it was a little awkward. We had an odd exchange with the hostess where she seemed very surprised we were here for brunch and reiterated how busy they were. We definitely expected to wait, since they don't take reservations. When we were seated, we were told, \"we were able to make a place for you,\" as if we were guests crashing a wedding... womp womp... awkward! Our server was very pleasant, but we didn't see her too much. I ended up going to the bar for a refill on my water (that Bloody Mary will get ya!). They seem a little understaffed, so no hard feelings there. Overall, totally willing to come back and give it another shot for that brunch delicious-ness."}
{"text":"I had a perfectly decent experience at Press, & the dinner I ordered - a margherita pizza - tasted fine. That said, I found most of the menu pretty unappealing. Every dish had at least a couple ingredients that I dislike, which is surprising given that I have a fairly broad palate. Sort of hard to do! The pizza was really the only thing of interest, which was disappointing; it's a meal I can get anywhere.   I guess I just can't figure out what Press is, you know? It's a wine bar, sure, & it feels like a wine bar - nice decor, quiet atmosphere. But somehow, the food feels just north of upscale pub fare, not quite nice enough for the restaurant's general ambiance. They serve deviled eggs, chicken paprikash, codfish,  tempura fried butternut squash, German fried chicken... I guess I'm just not sure what genre of food they're going for, & the result is muddled & confusing.  The other weird thing: I'm not a big wine person, but I went with my mom, who loves reds. When I do drink wine, I'm a white wine kinda gal, but my mom has no knowledge of it, so I figured the server could help me out. I told her I don't typically drink wine but was interested in a white that was neither too dry nor too sweet. \"Do you even, like, drink wine at all?\" she asked me. I told her I enjoy whites but just don't KNOW about them well enough to decide what to order from a massive list. She seemed annoyed & recommended the moscato - which even I know is the sweetest white out there. It tasted fine, but, of course, it was VERY sweet - so, you know, not really what I asked for. I would've expected a server at a wine bar to be a little bit more helpful when it comes to wine recommendations.   I'm told Press is great for brunch, & I'd give it a chance - but unless I was in a real pinch & the wait was too long someplace nearby, I probably wouldn't go back to Press for dinner."}
{"text":"I was in town for the Cavs/Hawks game and was looking for someplace to have brunch the next day. I had posted a question on a Cleveland message board here on yelp asking for brunch suggestions (only requirement was good drinks-mimosas,bloody Mary's,etc.) A number of restaurants were suggested-thanks all you Cleveland Yelpers-but this one was suggested multiple times and after reviewing the menu and comparing it to my other top choices (Tremont Taphouse or The Flying Fig were also front runners) I decided this was going to be my brunch spot this Sunday. My boyfriend and I arrived around 11:00am and it was pretty empty. We were seated in the back room with the garage doors and we were the only table back there for at least 30 minutes. Our server came over quickly and was friendly. The benedict of the day was crab benedict but we decided to choose off the regular menu. For drinks, my boyfriend ordered an oj (boring!) and I ordered a blueberry pomegranate mimosa-oh so tasty! Nicely garnished with a strawberry too. By the time our meals came, which was very quickly, I decided to order another one. For our meals, my boyfriend had the Croissant Sammy (2 Eggs, shaved country ham, white cheddar,kumato tomato, whole grain mustard hollandaise,served with home fries). He said the ham was particularly good and while I did not taste it, from appearance it looked quite yummy. I ordered the Press Omlette (Prosciutto, kumato tomato, goat cheese,fine herbs). This was so,so delicious!I loved the mix of goat cheese and prosciutto and the chives inside added a nice flavor.This came with homefries and wheat toast. The toast was good quality bread although I only ate 1/4 of the serving. The homefries were meh-came with a few peppers and onions mixed in. I also had a pear mimosa as a \"dessert\" after brunch and YUM-if you like pear-flavored things I'd highly recommend! I'd visit again the next time I am in Cleveland,however since I have several other restaurants on my \"must try\" list, I think I'll save Press Wine Bar for a later time"}
{"text":"Comfy porch sitting. Great people watching. Spot on, well seasoned, juicy burger with kickin' fries - Yum!  Worth spending time and ($) for a drink or two...or three."}
{"text":"This was an alright Sunday brunch. Would be three Stars except my awesome waitress. I ordered the Mexican Skillet. I switched the hash for seasoned fries. It was a little lackluster and not much flavor and a lot of flavorless cheese gratuitously added. I added some sriracha to spice it up. I tried the Market Bloody Mary and for some reason once I started drinking it I decided that I actually was not a fan of Bloody Mary's. I hadn't had one in about six months so apparently my taste had changes. I notified my waitress I had made the wrong choice and asked for a pear mimosa. Because I had left my drink pretty much untouched, she was kind enough to not charge me and I think that speaks a lot about the service considering it was my fault for just not liking Bloody Mary's. The mimosa was fantastic. The skillet was alright. I Wish the chorizo was spicier or more seasoned. Great atmosphere. My friend with me enjoyed his biscuits and gravy. Priced nicely"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Cleveland from Chicago, and pleased to hear that the executive chef at Press was recently at Sink | Swim in Chicago.  Definite resemblances in some of their menu items, and very happy to see it.  Tried the fish and chips this visit, but look forward to trying more in the near future.  Great place"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner/drinks with a large group for a meet up.   The service was polite and prompt. The server was also very knowledgable about the wine and beer.  My wife ordered a burger and I asked if I could have one with chicken instead of beef even though this option wasn't listed on the menu. The chef kindly agreed and I'm very glad they did; the sandwich was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, juicy, and the toppings and fries were also delicious.  The only thing not loved was the cocktail my wife ordered."}
{"text":"UGH. I want to like Press so much more than I do. I really don't have a good reason for not liking it ether. I've been here twice now and both experiences were lack luster and pretty mundane. The service is average and most of the food is good if you know what to order.  The first time I was here with my boyfriend and it was not our first choice. We came to Tremont on a busy Saturday and obviously had a crowd to fight. We ended up here after trying a couple other establishments packed to the brim. In hindsight, maybe the fact that Press wasn't super busy should have tipped me off. Our waiter was very nice and attentive for the first half hour and then we lost him. No idea where he was for the last hour of our meal but it wasn't waiting tables. We started with the large meat and cheese board and took our time. Tasting everything and scavenging for the delicious mixed nuts they hid among everything.  There was one meat on there that I was certain had gone bad. However, someone ordered the meat and cheese board the second time we were here and it tasted the same. Good for a joke, bad for the bar. For the main meal, I had the shredded winter squash flatbread. It was damn good for the first few pieces. Then I quickly realized that it was way too sweet to eat a lot of. The BBQ sauce had a sweet and savory taste but was scarce. If there was a little more sauce, I may have been able to eat more. I left hungry and grumpy. Trevor has the burger and he was very disappointed. It honestly looked like they had  taken a package of ground beef, cut a circle out of it, and grilled it as is. You could literally see the coils in the patty. Very unappetizing and not a very great first impression. Plus, he told me it tasted more like ground turkey.  The second time we came here, it was with around 17 other people. I give that girl a lot of credit for putting up with us. I'm not a big complainer but a couple people in our party sent things back. She did it all with a smile on her face. I had a bite of our friends spring rolls and immediately turned up my nose. It was all rice! add a little chicken or something...it was so dry that I dunked a big piece in the ginger sauce which caused new problems for me. The ginger was so overpowering. I have no idea what I ate, honestly. I ordered the Sopressata flatbread. It was, MEH. The salami had a funky taste to it and it threw me off a bit. Trev ordered the weekly inspired flatbread. It's a good thing we were sharing that night because I was instantly jealous. It was packed with spicy sausage and peppers with an awesome flavor going on. Delicious!  Maybe one day I'll walk in here and be blown away, but that has yet to happen..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of press, especially in the summer when the patio is open. The picture is obviously a delayed review (as there's no sun shining in January in Cleveland), but their blood Marys are delicious- I mean how can you ever go wrong topping something with bacon and egg??? Mimosas are just average. Brunch menu above average.   I do however really like their happy hour menu a lot. It changes frequent and the flat breads are tasty. Great for groups of people or a late night drink!"}
{"text":"Best peanut butter torte ever! It was just incredible. Came in with a group of friends for a night cap, but soon we all were eating desert.  Server was awesome! Very happy girl!  In glancing at the food menu, the prices seemed high, yet the place is in a great area, great atmosphere, so you pay extra I guess. I'm going back!"}
{"text":"A great happy hour in Tremont! $5 house wine pours and if wine isn't your thing they have some stellar $3 drafts. Flat breads, small plates and the usually happy hour fare is what you'll find here until 7! I wasn't crazy about the Hawaiian flat bread but I think I just did not like the flavor combination.  I will be adding this to my happy hour rotation and from reading the reviews this might be my next brunching destination as well!"}
{"text":"It was my last day in Cleveland, and I was feelin' some wine. My friend and I headed up to Tremont to see what was about (cute neighborhood, by the way, and the scholastic theme in street names was adorable), and we stumbled across this place. So, okay, actually we stopped here because Lolita was closed. I know, I know. That is probably the actual living curse of this place.  That said, we sat on the front patio (because there are two? Fancy!) and quickly had some wine brought out to us. Our server was obviously new, but in an adorable \"I'm trying really hard so bear with me\" kind of way.  The menu wasn't speaking to me for dinner as none of the options appealed to me at that time (All I wanted was some frickin' Italian and a bunch of wine, tbh. Because vacation.), but we did try the spring rolls. Now, they were good, but also...possibly pre-packaged and warmed up in the kitchen? They didn't seem warm all the way through, and they didn't seem like they were likely made in-house. I could be totally wrong, but that was the impression I got from them, and that is why this place only gets 3 stars instead of 4.  The red wine, however, was all good stuff. I had two glasses before moseying across the street to Dante (which is kitty corner from Lolita, and interestingly you can see Press Wine Bar's second patio in the back from the patio at Dante). If I lived here, I would go here for my usual wine bar activity: reading quietly in a corner with a good glass of wine. The interior, especially the bar, seems made for that activity."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed my time at Press Wine Bar. I held my birthday brunch here in February for about 15 lovely ladies. To be honest Press Wine Bar wasn't my first choice. I orginally picked somewhere else but then the guy called to tell me that he doesn't want to accomadate that many people for brunch. I'm so glad that worked out on my favor.    Atmosphere: We had a private dining area in the back with long wood tables. The decor was amazing and the presentation of everything was immaculate. Being an interior designer i appreciate style, decor and presentation to the fullest.  Drinks: We ordered mimosa kits for our party of 15 and they were out of this world. We got the magnum champagne bottles and the kits included 4 different kinds of juices and tons of fruit that came in a cute wooden crate. Their bloody mary's were awesome as well.  Food: ********************* thats how many stars I can give Press Wine Bar for their food. I had banana bacon pancakes. OMG!! they were amazing. The rest of the girls got biscuts and gravey and some other things and everyone couldn't stop talking about how amazing the food was.  Service: We had the most awesome servers. They were there when we needed them and they left us alone when they saw we were set. Came in at every perfect timing and were so patient and helpful for a group of 15 ladies.. because c'mon ladies we all know we are difficult.   Overall Experience: I can't wait to come back and try dinner and brunch again. I still talk about my birthday brunch and I want to do it again there next year I loved it so much. Everyone needs to try this place!!"}
{"text":"The door to this place greets you like you are about to have a fancy dinner at your super-together and chic neighbors house. It's the first thing I saw of this place and and it set me up for style.   I went to Press last night for the first time with two friends of mine. I literally knew nothing about it whatsoever except that my good friend was now tending bar and anywhere he places his feet is usually a good place but I was not expecting how incredible an experience I was to have this night. The place feels like an upscale neighborhood watering hole, catering to those with class and style but without all the snobbery that can come with that pairing. It's like the rich man's dive bar. A place to unwind, enjoy a very highly crafted and skillfully made drink, and snack on delicious and re-invented bar food. The energy it gives off says \"make friends\", which we did, when we were kindly bought a round by a sweet patron. I had an old fashion prepared for me with a comforting amount of citrus and milled cherries that married with this cold winter night. We shared an order of the mussels  and the steak with Brussels sprouts. The mussels were steamed to perfection with a rich broth that I could have slurped to my hearts content and the steak was succulent. The menu offers many enticing options (sandwiches, burgers, fish, cheese plate) and for gourmet bar food, the prices are reasonable enough to indulge. I will definitely come back ready to hunker down and cozy up for a long winters night again very soon!"}
{"text":"Press was everything I wanted it to be. I had a long day a work and needed a glass of wine. I called Press to find out if they had happy hour ... they did (Plus, it was till 7) I'm sold.   It was a nice day out and they have couches on their patio. I snagged up a couch and the boy and I enjoyed some wine. Our server was great and paid us just the right amount of attention. It was obvious we both had long stressful days and wanted to unwind and she let us do that while keeping our glasses and my stomach full. I got a flat bread (arugula, fig, goat cheese) aka all of my favorite things. It was light and perfectly filling without making me uncomfortably full.   I can't wait to go back and try some other menu items and drink more delicious wine. Their brunch is on my to-do list!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location a handful of times before so when I went back this last time and my experiences were still exceptional, I knew I needed to write a review. I really enjoy the Tremont neighborhood because of the interesting restaurants and the feel of a small town. There is nothing better than being able to walk down a street and pass so many fantastic restaurants such as Lolita, Fahrenheit, Dante, South Side, Parallex as well as little bakeries such as A Cookie and a Cupcake. Press Wine Bar fits in perfectly with this crowd:  Decor: The fact that it is located on a street corner, makes it easier to find. They have a little patio area in the front. The restaurant inside has a cozy feelings. There are candles at every table, little decorations on the table (we had Christmas flowers, see attached picture). There is a wine cellar that is visible with a glass door and window. There is visibility in the kitchen and the bar is really nicely placed as well as laid out.  Food:  This evening I was catching up with two girl friends so we each ordered something different so we could all try the different foods. For an appetizer, we shared the Crispy Risotto and Mozzarella which was made with basil pesto, tomato sauce, rosemary and balsamic reduction. I love these! You can also get this appetizer at the Rocky River Wine Bar (since they are owned by the same person). I had the Spicy Salami flatbread which was good, nothing special just good. It was made with milano salami, sriracha garlic and Parmesan cream sauce, pepperoncinis, provolone, black cerignola olives. Maybe just a small kick of spicy but nothing crazy. We also tried the Squash Flatbread which was made with butter nut squash puree, pancetta, goat cheese, apple and maple drizzle. And the Lobster Flatbread which was made with maine lobster meat, truffle mascarpone spread, mushrooms, parmesan, chives. The Lobster flatbread was the best!  Service: Wow, that is all I have to say! Our service was awesome, she was so patient with us. Myself and one other person arrived at Press Wine bar first so we got a table and ordered some wine. Our server was very patient with us to wait for our third girl friend to arrive before we ordered our meals.   All in all, I highly recommend this location to anyone! It's the perfect place to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or just to catch up with some friends.  Side Tip: Perfect place for happy hour. They have 5 different appetizers and flatbreads that are 5$ and a bunch of wines for 5$ as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love hitting up Press - no matter what the occasion or time of day.  This joint is great for celebrating a birthday [whattup great Scotch Flights], a date-night out, or a chill brunch meet-up - Press is your spot.      They have a fantastic wine selection, of course, as this is a wine bar; but I what I prefer even more so are the various different flights of scotch or whiskey that they offer as well as their charcuterie and cheese boards - absolutely delish.  The ambiance suits those combinations perfectly as well - with a classy vibe, nice barrel-themed designs, and a spacious area as well.  In addition to the great drinks, Press also offers a surprisingly fantastic brunch.  If, like me, you actually loathe breakfast [pls don't hurt me], and are tired of all the joints in CLE offering a misnomer of a brunch that only consists of egg-themed dishes missing the '-unch' of 'Brunch' - then THIS is the spot to take all your brunch loving friends for mimosas and bloody marys or whatever the hell brunch folk like.  They offer plenty of non-eggy/breakfasty sandwiches and flatbreads and each are great.  So, the next time you have to sigh or roll your eyes at your brunch-loving homies upon the suggestion, offer up Press and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place when we were wandering around the corner. I liked the Decoy 2011 wine we ordered - very tame but has a dry after taste. We also ordered the chocolate peanut butter mousse - it does not have that much chocolate cake or chocolate flavor, mainly dominated by its peanut butter mousse, but it's very soft and moist. I loved it. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Service was great too. You can definitely take your time to enjoy your wine."}
{"text":"Perfect Brunch.  Open Saturday and Sunday serving brunch til 3.  Good option if you don't want to stand outside waiting for a table at Lucky's or Grumpy's.  They have a bunch of different and very interesting Bloody Mary options, as well as Mimosa's.  They provide an entire 'Mimosa Cart' with about a dozen different berries/fruits as well as the same amount of different juices to add to your morning cocktail.  Friendly, good service and awesome atmosphere.  The food options for brunch are a bit limited and 'exotic', won't get your ordinary omelette or eggs benny here.  It's all got a twist to it.  I was more impressed with the Bloody Mary than the food, but that's enough for me.  Plus, each different variety of the drink comes with an 'appetizer'; mine with a cream cheese and bacon stuffed pepperoncini, and my friend's with peppered bacon and a deviled egg.    I'll definitely be back for brunch, and probably to try that barrel aged wine too."}
{"text":"First visit, Sunday Brunch. We both had the Croissant Sammy breakfast sandwich. Plan on it being your meal for the day...fantastic. Croissant, sliced grilled tomato, hollandaise, shaved ham, Swiss cheese and 2 eggs your style. Pomegranate mimosa! Outside seating in beautiful Tremont area."}
{"text":"Last night, \"The Girl\" aka Erin O. and I met some friends at Press for some last minute holiday morsels.  I say last minute because Press was the only place willing to squeeze our party of seven in on 24 hours notice.  I love Tremont; each place has its own flavor, and I love this new addition.  The vibe begins as you enter the breezeway, with cork and wine crate walls immediately bringing the purpose of this place into focus. We were seated next to the floor-to-ceiling wine room, which was absolutely beautiful.  Our $24 bottle of Malbec, yes $24, was perfectly chilled as if it came from a private wine cellar.  Our group shared the meat and cheese tray, mussels, fried rissoto, and the incredible breakfast flat bread, which wasn't a maple-fest, but rather highlighted with a butternut squash \"sauce\" that simply melted in your mouth.  Service was very good for a young (open 4 weeks) establishment.  The timing of our drinks and food was spot on, and everything came out fresh and hot.  My only complaint comes from the servers lack of knowledge regarding the Pinot Grigio selections, but I'm sure that will improve with time.    Welcome to Tremont.  Once again, the area has been blessed with another great place to explore.  The Girl and I will certainly be returning to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is bumping already!  We had a few \"new restaurant\" kinks - our dessert came out before our appetizers and service was a bit slow. But man, everything was very tasty.  I had the fried risotto, which I'm pretty sure was trying to kill me, and it was filled with cheesy delicious risotto and had a crispy fried outside.    The wine list is very nice and features a few by-the-tap selections (pretty cool!) and lots of glass options.  The interior is a huge improvement from Lago's cheesy mural.  The wine room looks classy and very modern.  All the beer choices were from different Ohio breweries.  We weren't impressed with the cocktails, but at least that option is there for the non-wine person in the group.  Overall, very nice and I hope they keep getting better."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection, delicious food. I tried a rose and malbec - both were good.   Menu is small, but everything sounded good from small plates to salad to burgers and full entree. I got the bacon, goat cheese, honey arugula flatbread - yum.   Service was OK, they only had like one person waiting on majority of dining room! He did a good job for the circumstance. Something odd when we got there around 7:30, we were told there was a 30 min wait even though there were empty tables, so definitely think there was a staffing issue that night. We only waited about 10 mins tho.   Wish they offered wine flights, but they don't. Pourquoi?"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Pear mimosa was uniquely delicious. Was excited to see tofu scramble and hash browns on menu. But curry in a tofu scramble? Not tasty. If kitchen tried other spices. this could be a standout dish! Definitely needed more onions and green and red peppers (not hot)."}
{"text":"Regarding brunch  Brunch hours: Sat & Sun 1000-1500  We arrived at around 11 on Saturday. There was one table just leaving which left me as the only party in the restaurant. While we were eating 3 other parties came in, but the place was no where near full.  Service, as expected with the empty restaurant, was efficient and our waitress was on top of things. The kitchen was also quick.   I ordered the Chorizo Skillet which was served in a skillet on a circular wooden trivet. It contained, Scrambled eggs, potato hash, local Chorizo sausage, roasted peppers, and a little cheddar cheese on top. It was all mixed together, but pretty much just layered, with the eggs on top, and potatoes on the bottom. It was really good in terms of flavour and the serving size was great, but it wasn't super hot. For being just made I thought it should have been hotter. It wasn't cold, but cool for having been a skillet. $10.50  The person I was with got the Crab Benedict which is a very cool idea. It is your normal eggs Benedict but between the egg and the Toasted English muffin is a seared crab cake. It is served with sriracha hollandaise sauce which can be obtained on the side. Well, she asked for the cook to go easy on the sauce, and the waitress' response was that she'd put it on the side... $12.50  All in all a good brunch, just oddly not busy. Perhaps it had more to do with the horribly plowed streets, which is where you have to park, more than the food."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a stellar review, but I just can't.  My boyfriend planned a surprise birthday party for me here, since I loved it the first two times I came earlier - food was great, staff was great, atmosphere was spot on!  I found out about it, of course and had to play a role in the planning.  From the start, things were a problem.  We planned to rent out a room and have an open bar and appetizer course for about 20-30 people for about 2 hours to start, then have a sit-down dinner.  We scheduled a tasting for some of the appetizers.  Not only did it take pulling teeth to show us a catering menu, rather than have us order off the REGULAR menu, they charged us for most of the items for the tasting.  It's not like we wanted the food - we wanted to pick for the event.  Then, the event coordinator was going to be out of town for the event.  Totally fine.  But we got calls that they would be out of several items, including several bottles of wine we ordered and some food items.  We had no one to go to.  The event itself was great!  Food was amazing, wine and drinks were free flowing and the staff was great.  We really enjoyed that part. (they ruined my dinner with a well done burger when I ordered rare, but I was having so much fun, it was OK.  And they waitresses were very sweet about it)   The disappointing part:  We spent several hundred for the party- more than a thousand? (plus people's dinners), but they didn't bother to bring out a piece of birthday cake.  Further, the event coordinator never bothered to follow up with us to see how it went.  I thought that wasn't great customer service.  If she had, I would have recommended her place to many others for their special events.  Now, not so much since I feel that all she wanted was our money, not our repeat business."}
{"text":"The back room is an excellent place to host an event. The management and the staff was super flexible and nice. The food was outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"Brunchapalooza!    I'd heard good things about the brunch here, and boy...had I heard right!  This may be my new brunch spot!   First off, they had everything I like on a Sunday morning.  Plenty of seats (no line), an attentive staff, interesting décor, a tv...and on to the food:  drinks: Wow, what a selection!  I had the press bloody mary and, to be quite honest, it was one of the best bloodies I've had in a long time!  There was a wide selection of mimosas and bloddies at the table and we were all impressed.  food: I got an omletette, but shared in the squash breakfast pizza.  They were great.  I especially liked the potato/pepper side.  Very good!  Overall, you need to check this place out if you haven't yet!  Why wait for an hour at SouthSide when this is better???"}
{"text":"Awesome! Everything we ordered was fabulous! Great cheese tray, risotto balls and flatbreads! I ordered the chicken w risotto and wanted to lick the plate...but that wouldn't be ladylike.  The wine was great also!  Service was prompt and friendly!  Will be making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"It was Christmas weekend. Our friends were home from NYC and we needed somewhere that would fit our party of seven. Yikes... all of our fave places turned us away on such short notice. Press is new... and I've been wanting to try it - but I was thinking it would be something The Boy and I did quietly one weeknight - in case it sucked. ;) I called the restaurant and the hostess was so helpful. Even though they didn't have a ton of big tables available, she worked some magic and got us in! Ok... at least we had a place now. No guarantees at this point how good the place would be.   When you walk in, they've created a small entryway with wine crates and corkboard that was SO charming. I immediately started wondering which hall in my loft I could duplicate it with. The inside was completely redone... dark wood and an amazing built out brick wine cellar with floor to ceiling glass. Our table was right next to it and I was in love with how chic it looked. The vibe in this place is amazing.   The boy and I ordered a Malbec that was very reasonably priced... and really tasty. The cellar had it at a perfect cool-end of room temp and it tasted perfect. The waiter was super friendly and knew the perfect balance of checking in and moving our table along. We never felt rushed - but he came by often. He was a self-described red drinker though, and couldn't help with one of our friend's pinot grigio selection. He did, however, offer help from their sommelier. And, they enjoyed their bottle.   Food. Omg. We had mussels, scallops....delish! We ordered the large meat/cheese board which had some really tasty cuts and preserves served with flatbread. My only suggestion would be for them to offer a second type of bread. The crackery flatbread was good... but a soft bread might have been a nice compliment.   AND then... OMG. I ordered the breakfast pizza. I died... went to heaven... and came back just to write this review. The \"sauce\" is a butternut squash puree. Then - maple breakfast sausage (sagey) and poached egg. Whaaaaat?!!! This was incredible. Not really sweet... not too savory. Not even really all that breakfasty - but delicious. Order it. Seriously.   Press is a great addition to Tremont. Good food, good wine, good service. I'm sold."}
{"text":"A bunch of my coworkers and I decided to do happy hour here one weeknight after work. Only a few people had been there before but they highly recommended it. I was there first and hostess was extremely friendly and found me a table to accommodate my party right away. The wine bar itself so SUPER adorable. The lights are dimmed so it's a more intimate feel. The little entryway is adorable. We were seat next to a walk in wine cellar so it was nice to see all the bottles. One other girl and I were the only ones there for a while, so while waiting for the rest of my friends to show up, I ordered the Crispy Risotto and Mozzarella appetizer - which was only 5 dollars on the happy hour menu. I asked for a recommendation for a cabernet and our waitress recommended the First Press Cab which was also 5 dollars on the HH menu!   I LOVED the wine- so much so that I had 2 more glasses of the same bottle. The risotto and mozzarella balls were WONDERFUL. There were three balls in the bowl and they were on a bed of tomato sauce. SO fried. So fresh. So gooey. and SO delish. A few friends tried it and also loved it. We asked the waitress which HH flatbreads were the most popular. And she said, hands down, the Squash one. A few of the girls ordered that and thoroughly enjoyed them. It didn't sound good to me, so I just got the margherita and LOVED it. I tried the Squash one and was glad I didn't get a whole one for myself - just not my taste.   We were there a bit after HH ended so I tried the Rule 1 Cab which was on tap... Wine?? on Tap??? how interesting! Loved the wine choice.  The service was wonderful. From the second our waitress started taking care of us, she was attentive, SUPER friendly, helpful, and patient. Since this was after work and we work in a hospital, everyone was coming in and leaving at different times and even though I thought it would have been a bit annoying, she was so sweet and assured me it was really ok. The wines and food all came out very fast and she was always stopping by to see if we needed anything else.  Like I said the food and wines on the HH menu were all 5 dollars each- TOTALLY reasonable. And, they don't give you smaller portions  (which I notice some places do). So overall, after getting 2 food items, 3 glasses of HH wine, and 1 regular priced wine, I walked out of there spending less than 40 dollars (without tip or tax). Worth it?? I think so!!  Overall - wonderful experience and I will definitely be back. I would LOVE to come back in the summer and drink wine on their patio. They are undergoing some construction in the back and can't wait to see how it looks once it's done. I also want to come back and experience their weekend brunch - I've heard WONDERFUL things."}
{"text":"I attended Happy Hour with 3 girlfriends after work. Got to Tremont around 5pm and was able to find free street parking right across from The Press which is amazing. There was a lot of available seats inside and out, and you don't have to sit at the bar to be able to partake in their Happy Hour specials!  My friend had gotten there first and the women working the bar was amazing. She cashed my friend out, recommended a table outside for us to enjoy the final days of summer and set it up the table for us. The waitress got us all waters, explained all the specials for us, and gave us great recommendations for those that weren't sure what they wanted.  The Happy Hour food and wine specials were amazing for $5! Huge portions and plenty to take home for lunch tomorrow!  I highly recommend The Press for Happy Hour, especially because their Happy Hour goes until 7pm which is perfect for after work meet ups with the girls! Thank you for making it a great night for 4 friends to catch up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Happy hour review. I'm a bit biased because this is the hood I grew up in that has turned YP empty nester haven and keeps getting better. Squash Flatbread mussels, deviled eggs. All $5. And I was stuffed. Wine, beer, and shots.  Service excellent. Everyone sitting at the bar super friendly and laid back cool."}
