{"text":"My mom and I ordered from this restaurant one night when neither of us wanted to cook and we had no food in the fridge. 

We had to wait for an hour before I finally placed a second call and we were assured that they were just ''extra busy'' and that our food was on the way which honestly pissed me off more than anything because my own father owned a restaurant for years and the idea of make clients wait for so long would be enough to make him mad.

When the delivery guy arrived, we found that the price seemed higher than what was announced. That would be because their so-called free delivery included paying for 3$ worth of gas for the delivery which was ludicrous since we live close to the restaurant. We also gave the driver a tip because we hadn't noticed that.

The food itself was bland and tasteless and we had to add more sauce than we ever had to to give a little bit of taste to the chicken which by the way was barely there (we ordered two different chicken plates plus fried rice that contain so little chicken, we had to look for it). 

Overall, it was overpriced, took a long time to arrive and was one of the worst chinese food I ever had in my entire life. I honestly do not recommend it to anyone and am surprised why it has any good reviews at all. Maybe it's better if you go in store but even then, I wouldn't even go after our experience."}
{"text":"I am not sure why the negative reviews for Man Li.

For a start it is an awesome name, so how could the food possibly be bad?

I am about to order again and this is perhaps the 15th time. We have only once been marginally disappointed, but the rest of the time it is perfectly decent North American Chinese food. 

If you are expecting really GREAT Chinese Chinese food then this is not your place. But then again I have not found such a place in the West Island. For that we go to China Town.

The egg foo young is really excellent. If you haven't tried this dish, do. Not something \i would naturally order, but after I tried it is a staple.

Let me know where is better in the West Island. I am keen to know."}
{"text":"I went there with my best friend about 2 days ago. While it looked like a ghetto hideout for a Chinese mob reunion, I must say it is \"LEGIT\". The place seems to have gotten most of their tables from the Salvation Army across the street though...

The prices are quite adequate, the meals are DELICIOUS (first time I eat eggplant and DEFINITELY not the last) and the cashier is very friendly and talkative.

The store is small but it mostly seems to do deliveries. Since it is a family-owned restaurant, they are willing to do custom orders!

Don't judge a place by its looks or you might be missing out on a gem!

Decor: 2/5 (Not the kind of place you want to bring a date to)
Food: 5/5 (OMG NOM NOM NOM)
Prices 4/5 (a plate full of eggplant with sauce and free rice on the side for 12.50$? Awesome!)
Staff: 4/5 (VERY friendly cashier and custom orders allowed :). The owners seem to not be able to speak English or French adequately which, in my opinion, adds to the whole \"We're an actual Chinese restaurant\" feel. )

Way worth a visit. Authentic Chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Never again. The quality of the food has gone down. I have never had chicken fried rice that was tasteless along with their chow mein which also was. The chicken soo guy wasn't bad when there was chicken in it! The seafood soup was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Honestly it's horrible. I used to love Man-Li and admittedly haven't had it in years.  I was quite excited to have it again having nothing but fond memories of it.  It was disgusting. The chicken was rubbery and spongy to be kind and old to be unkind.  The shrimps we're way overdone and everything was sickeningly sweet sauces.  The Hunan dumplings were filled with nothing other than dough and were slimyish, the vegetables were off in colour and the spring rolls made me shudder with whatever they were filled with. 0 stars if possible or 1 star as we didn't get food poisoning either. Avoid, avoid, avoid...."}
