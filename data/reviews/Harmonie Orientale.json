{"text":"Went there for the lunch special. It was $10.50 for chicken with mixed vegetables that came with choice of soup and a spring roll. Everything seems to be fresh the soup was tasty and the restaurant seems clean."}
{"text":"I came across this place two summers ago with my bestfriend and ex we were supposed to go else where but it turned out being really good.  Inside is cute minus the old carpet that should be ripped up.  Food comes quickly. -spring rolls are great  -sesame seed beef or Wtv is weird.  there's supposed to be a sushi bar but I believe that's shut down now.  Husband and wife own the place and are the only workers I believe.  Wifi is a no no because \"to slow for money\" which I'm not sure what that meant but I guess that's a no.  Will return but strictly for peanut butter dumplings and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Home run once again. Such great, fresh flavours. Run don't walk here. So good.   Peanut butter dumplings are to die for!"}
{"text":"La bouf avait l air pas pire mais il ne faut prendre des sushis Ã  cette place, leurs sushis ne sont pas frais du tout"}
