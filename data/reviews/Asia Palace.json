{"text":"Used to be called East Ocean Dim Sum. Newly renovated, fresh coat of paint..that being said food is the same...over fried shrimp balls or maybe
reheated..service takes a long time ..it took us 15 minutes to wait for our food..another 10 before the soda we ordered came..another 15 minutes for the take out box to come. Totally disorganized! Servers so unmindful of customers.
Do not be fooled by the new look of this place..terrible!"}
{"text":"Great fun at Asia Palace with DJ Mel, dancing and karaoke every Friday/Saturday from 6pm to 9:30pm.  Come join the fun and Good food and of course great friends."}
{"text":"We trued it for the first time last week and it was delicious. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We're probably eating there again tonight. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not serve Dim Sum. I'm not sure if the lack of offering Dim Sum is due to rising cost or if it's a result in the change of management. The interior space is beautifully designed with a vibrant cerulean blue wall, attractive paintings, an array of hung Japanese parasols, and an artsy cinematic film scroll featuring food and travel. I notice the restaurant space is quite expansive, they have a huge bar, lots of table seating with plenty of lighting, and one can definitely host a big catering party event. It just makes me wonder why is the place so empty, there is hardly any customer. 

I went for the Eggplant Szechuan Garlic Style ($14.95) which has eggplant sautéed with red bell pepper, scallion, onion, dried mushroom, and bamboo shoots in Szechuan sauce, and also got an order of Singapore Style Fried Rice Vermicelli ($12) which is rice noodles sautéed with chicken, onion, scallions, red bell pepper, bean sprouts, and scramble egg in curry sauce. The food is delicious. The Eggplant Szechuan Garlic Style taste amazing, I like how the eggplant is sautéed well and it's so soft and very flavorful. The Singapore Style Fried Vermicelli has good tender chicken and I like the veggies that came with it. My only suggestion is that they add a little more curry spice on the noodles to elevate the flavor. An order for a side of rice to eat with eggplant and requesting for hot tea is an additional charge. I just find it rather strange that they would charge for hot tea. At other Asian restaurant, hot tea is usually offered as complimentary with the meal. 

In regards to service, I feel it's a little slow but the dine-in atmosphere is nice and very intimate. The manager comes by to check up and see how everything is. I had refills on my hot tea and the food portions are plentiful. I am happy with my order and I wouldn't mind returning for the same dish as these are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"yummy food. & amazing music too. will definitely  be back. Thank you Thalia for the great service & Gina for always making sure we were okay."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Really don't know how they're still running. The workers are unfriendly, the manager brushes anything you say off. It's a dim sum restaurant and usually with dim sum it's provided immediately. Here you have to wait for it. I ordered to go, steamed Shu Mai and steamed broccoli, I waited 25 minutes with an empty restaurant before I said anything. A joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"They're phasing out selling dim sum but when i walked in she offered up the shrimp dumplings and sticky rice. I decided that would work and asked her to make t to goShe asked if i could wait a little bit; sure no problem. 25 min later.. here's what i get."}
{"text":"No more dim sum! Yikes! They are not serving anymore dim sum at this restaurant. I will say the Chinese food is good. Place is clean and quiet So if your looking for pretty good food at a reasonable price for Chinese you won't be disappointed. I've seen several folks come and go because they don't have dim sum anymore. To be honest it wasn't that great here. I recommend china town but it was close to home. Soldier on!"}
{"text":"The Bad: They messed up the order tonight. Ordered the BBQ pork & it didn't have the glaze sauce on it. Had them remake it. But, decided to cancel it, thou. Took a lot of time to get the order made. Ordered the shrimp chowfun & it came with beef, chicken, shrimp mix. Had them remake it, as well & decided to cancel it, as well. Took a lot of time to get the order made. So just had the egg drop soup tonight & the honey walnut shrimp. Both were decent dishes. They did not have dim sum & it's a dim sum asian restaurant. Guess they only have it available for lunch & not available for dinner.

The Good: They remodeled & looks nice. A convenient location for Henderson residents."}
{"text":"Tried to take family from out of town here while they were visiting. 11:30am on a Sunday and they aren't serving dim sum. It's literally the first thing promoted on their new sign, and they aren't serving it."}
{"text":"Great food! Was there today & wow so full. I believe the young girls name was Thalia & she was doing very well with her team. Gina was always attentive and making sure we were ok. Food was top notch very authentic. 10/10 will be back."}
{"text":"Was on my way home (in Henderson) and thought I would stop and grab a beer and some food. I was originally going to stop off at twin peaks like I normally do but happened across a restaurant that had what looked like a light show reflecting off the windows and caught my attention. Asia palace is a GEM! The new GM of Asia Palace is reason enough to come in and just stare! Wow! She was so friendly and welcoming and just had a warm presence about her that was so inviting I couldn't say no. I hoped that Gina (new GM) wouldn't be my server because she would take all of my money hahaha! They have also started playing music and opens up a dance floor for any to enjoy should they feel like! Great atmosphere and even better service and food! The duck is sooooooo good!! Must try! I'll definitely be back to see Gina! And to try the food of course!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the new owner changing everything. East Ocean, which served dim sum in carts, has now become a muddled mess (especially by rebranding it something as generic as \"Asia Palace\"). They no longer serve proper dim sum but made things to order. Everything tasted bland and microwaved. Even the sesame balls - which were previously the best I've had - are just horribly mediocre now.

And they've removed the chicken feet! Incredible. They literally just crossed it out from the menu.

It's a massive disrespect to what was once the best dim sum in the Vegas area. I would not recommend this to anybody, even people who don't particularly care about dim sum that much. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Limited dim sum selections and the four dishes we picked had one taste in common, SWEET.  The chow fun (expensive) was overloaded with sweetener.  We don't mind paying $12 for a small plate of rice noodle without meat if it tasted decent.  Maybe we don't have the \"fusion\" taste bud.  The Phoenix Talons (chicken feet) and the fried glutinous rice dumplings were overly sweet.  The rice dumplings looked and tasted like they were re-fried.  We also ordered xiaolongbao steam buns (XLB) and the 3 pieces nestled in their individual foil container looked very much like the ones sold by Trader Joe's.  The 3 XLB's looked identical like machine made and not hand made.  We asked the waitress for the usual vinegar dip with julienne ginger.  She responded \"we don't use that here\".  She came back and landed a bottle of red vinegar with the look/attitude like we are some village bumpkins that don't know what XLB's are.  The same waitress came back, placed our order slip on the table and made a loud tap with her fingers.  I am sorry we are not sophisticated diners and that we offended the establishment.  My companion told me Asia Palace renovated the joint but I think the owner should pay more attention to the food and service."}
{"text":"The old East Ocean restaurant under a different name.  Similar setup, same employees and a few new staff. Dim sum menu has pictures and prices, but half are crossed off with a pen indicating that the restaurant does not serve the items. Not much dim sum to order. No tea selection, just jasmine tea, which is $1.50 per person. 
You have to order the dim sum- not available on steam trays rolling around like most dim sum restaurants. After ordering, the dim sum arrived very quick. Of course the food was already made hours ago (not made to order) and not even at a safe temperature for consumption, just the disappointing room temperature or food poisoning environment. Dim sum texture is overcooked and bland tasting. A 2 star rating for friendly staff and no food poisoning (yet)."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food best Chinese food I've had since moving to Las Vegas this place is under new management Gina you did a great job we will be back"}
{"text":"The new Asia Palace is beautiful inside.  Calming background music, private dining areas for larger parties and white table cloths.  The main attraction, however, was the food!   We started out with a few dim sum, excellent flavor and texture.  Then came the spicy Szechuan beef with broccoli (savory and delicious), followed by the best tofu, mushrooms and vegetables that I had ever had.  Finally, there was the shrimp in noodles which was terrific!  The one thing that was apparent was the quality of the ingredients, no aftertaste from the beef which in other Chinese restaurants has been chemically tenderized.  No MSG, either!   (I am allergic, so I asked).  I have found my new favorite neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and don't need Chinatown!  See photos. 

Follow up review:

I came back a few days later and had the honey walnut shrimp served with broccoli and walnuts.  Just the right \"tang\" with large fresh (not frozen shrimp).  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is very expensive a salt and pepper pork chop is $16 come on a pork chop $16 in there Portion is really small."}
{"text":"Just ate here today, and the food was so amazing, I downloaded Yelp for the firstt time just so I could review this place and say how great they are. Our server was Thalia, and she was incredibly nice. The entire staff was so great to both my husband and I. We were made to feel welcome before we even got our drinks. The dining room is beautiful, very big and airy. The food was FANTASTIC!!! It was my husband's first time having Asian food, and I've been eating Asian food my whole life and we both loved everything. I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Asia Palace is the definition of disappointment. It's obvious this place has only changed for the worst. The food is mediocre crap with quality less than a Panda Express. Chow Mein is soggy because they literally drown it in sauce same with Chow Fun. I couldn't eat another bite of it and frankly am done and never coming again."}
{"text":"This place used to be East Ocean. Now its called Asia Palace. Used to be great when they had a vast selection of dimsum items. Now its very limited. They even used the same dimsum menu as East Ocean but they just show you what you can order. Funny since you see some great stuff in the menu but can't order it. Food still taste good but the limited selection is a bummer. We used to go here a lot whenever we visit Vegas but will probably no longer return. Miss East Ocean."}
{"text":"This is a rewrite of the old Oceans East..... many things we wanted they were out of.  Fried rice was hard as a rock and old!  Tasted like it was done two days before.....uneatable.  Hot and Sour soup had too much vinegar in it  - must have been added just as it was being served.  There was no Dim Sum.  Our lunches were not good and we have crossed this off our list.  They won't last much longer at this rate."}
{"text":"Saturday night about 8pm is when we decided to have the two favorite dishes from our first visit.
Consistency is important to me and tonight this place failed to deliver on the Lemon chicken and Seafood Fried noodles.
The chicken was tough and overcooked. It was not delicious and succulent like the first visit. The seafood fried noodles was too fishy like the salt water ocean taste. 
Yikes, I will not go back here because the price fails to deliver the value. $29 is not worth being dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Well, first I was looking for East Ocean and saw that Yelpers reported it as closed.  I then found out it was replaced by \"Asia Palace\".  No big deal - appears to be the same restaurant - Chinese food with Dim Sum.

Well, when I came there were less than a handful of Yelp reviews (of which were no good anyway) but I figured I'd give them a chance.  Very regretfully - I brought a friend who really likes dim sum and my family here.  Seems like they cleaned up the place a little bit and tried to make it a little more classy.  We were greeted by a few familiar faces from the old East Ocean restaurant (also note that their dim sum menu still says East Ocean on it).  Apparently this is an Asian Fusion restaurant that also serves \"dim sum\"

Well anyway - we were there for the dim sum so we asked for the dim sum menu.  Other yelpers are correct in that they don't push the carts around anymore (which to me is part of the dim sum experience anyway).. half the items on the menu were crossed off with a marker.. WTH.. no chicken feet, no congee among other things.  We proceeded to try the few items that were not crossed out.. let's just say the items that were normally steaming hot now taste microwaved and the fried items are well.. fried to hell.  Big disappointment.  I pretty much figured out that they've eliminated items that take a long time to prepare and replaced them with things they could either fry or microwave quickly.

Oh, also another big disappointment - they couldn't/wouldn't serve us tap water for \"health reasons\" ... does this mean your water isn't even safe to drink let alone cook with? Good thing they talked a couple of us into buying Cokes but where did the water come from to make the ice cubes?

Way to make the place look fancy with a bar area and a roped off wannabe \"classy\" dining area and completely destroy the food.  I'm sure this would be a cool place to hang out but their food/menu and water situation is a mess.  I'm surprised the health inspector hasn't shut them down for having non-potable water.  What a disappointment after going to what once was the best dim sum restaurant on this side of town.  Mark my words, this place is going downhill fast.  At least the waitress was nice.

Run away"}
{"text":"We've gone here before for dim sum when it was another name and/or owner. It was pretty good the handful of times we went. We came back for the first time since the name (or ownership) change and what a disappointment!

So, dim sum. What's the first thing that comes to mind when describing dim sum? The carts? It is for me and my family. And guess what? THERE ARE NO CARTS. We were SO confused. The server came up to us and asked us what we wanted to order almost immediately after we were seated. They gave us a one page laminated menu with pictures and names of the dim sum options but what the heck!!!!! So messed.

Obviously that threw us off but it just kind of set of this weird vibe for the rest of the meal. I guess we can't deal with change lol. The two tables next to us left while we were still eating and both of their checks listed items they didn't order, we heard them both dispute it. Thankfully, ours was correct. The food was ok, it came out almost instantly, so I kind of wondered how that was possible but then didn't really want to think about it too much lol.

We won't come back - we need the dim sum carts!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but they need to bring back the dim sum.  This was the only dim sum place on this side of town."}
{"text":"Nice and clean environment. Music was soothing. Food was delicious and our server, Rogelio, was wonderful!!! We didn't have to ask for a drink refill and they checked on us several times. We had the lunch menu- sweet and sour chicken and mangolian beef with fried rice, egg flour soup and an egg role. All were delicious, including the egg flour soup. There's a cute section separated with beaded curtains for a small party. Tables are covered in clothe and dishes are nice and contemporary. Wish I took pictures!!! I will next time!"}
{"text":"What a joke, the manager told waiter not to tell customer they are giving away one glass of wine for free in front of my table. I got my check saw she charge double on the tea, I also ask her if you guys,dont serve dim sum why do you still have a,sign out for Dim Sum? she told me its not enough time to take it down, so that means its false advertisement. Everthing on the menu are increased  price compare to before, The manager's name is Jenny. I will never go back to this place again. also not recommend for anyone at all."}
{"text":"Honestly my first time eating Chinese food and I loved it. My wife loves Chinese food and has been trying to get me to try it for years and I finally did. Couldnt be happier with this decision.

Had the cashew chicken and the curry chicken and loved both. The chili oil on the table was also great.

Thalia was our server and she was very helpful in picking food to be safe around a glutin allergy. We will absolutely be back.

Loved it!!"}
{"text":"\"Dim sum and Asian fusion lounge\" should've just called it \"Asian fusion lounge\" specially since the only Dim sum served here are potstickers! Talk about variety. Lol the only reason why we went to this place was for dim sum but whatever. Lmao.

We decided to stay and at least try the other food. The food we got was alright, we got the Mandarin pork chop, some pot stickers and veggie rolls. It really wasn't anything special. Portions are decent size but are kinda pricey. The only standout was the Beef Sirloin Hot Pot, it was really good. The beef was tender and it was flavorful. The pot stickers weren't anything special, kinda meh tbh.

Place was nice and clean, Service was ok, we were seated a few mins after we came and our waiter did his job but kinda just let us do our thing after the food was served. It didn't really bother us but it might bother some people."}
{"text":"This place has gone waaaaay downhill since changing management. I was a regular customer at East Ocean for years and was horribly disappointed when I tried Asia Palace. First off, the entire time we were in the restaraunt, there were workers(?) unapologetically drilling right next to us. They didn't even seem to think that it might bother their customers. It seems that they were fixing all of the empty chairs that no one was sitting in (probably because no one wants to be subjected to an earful of drilling sounds while trying to eat). Additionally, to make things even better, the food was horrendously mediocre. For the price I paid (which was not cheap), I expected at least decent food but that was definitely not the case. The wonton noodle soup I ordered felt like it was freshly unfrozen and plopped in some lukewarm chicken stock. I also discovered burnt pieces of who-knows-what in the fried rice. I might have been better off having Panda Express to be honest. Overall, horrible ambience, disappointing food. While I'm sad to lose a regular lunch spot, I would definitely recommend steering clear of this place."}
{"text":"The best lemon chicken we've had! All entrees were delish, newly remodeled decor is beautiful, service was A+. A neighborhood treasure."}
{"text":"I went to Asia Palace because it was really the only Chinese restaurant in the area and my in-laws will only eat Chinese food.  I saw the other reviews, but decided to brave it since ANY Chinese food was better than unhappy in laws. 

To my surprise, they did a pretty good job on the food.  Asia Palace serves some pretty authentic Chinese food.  Yes the other reviews mention lack of Dim Sum variety, which is true.  We ordered straight off the regular menu, which had a good 100+ items.   We even ordered a roast duck, which only took them 15 mins to whip up.  So to set some expectations for future visitors - they just don't have the army of carts and old ladies yelling out \"Su mai!!\" that you see at other dim sum places.  Go for the regular menu if you want some good food.

The -2 stars is for service, which was practically inexistent.  It takes a really long time to flag down a server.  They had asked us if we wanted tea.. when there was already tea on our table.  The people were not the most friendliest.  Dare I say that's what makes it an authentic Chinese restaurant?  When we paid, they collected our CC and then forgot about us.  Of course, we also couldn't get anyone's attention.  We ended up walking up to the front counter to pay."}
{"text":"Justin our server saved our stay at this place. He was amazing, accommodating, provided premiere service. Recommended we try the salt and pepper chicken and I actually liked it. Thank you for the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"This place has some very tasteful dishes .  I loved their Kung pao chicken and noodle dishes !!!! Definitely a favorite !"}
{"text":"Came here and expected good food but what I got was great! New specials I guess they came with because they were not in the menu but im so happy our server mentioned them. We tried the coconut shrimp curry and pineapple fried rice & it was delicious!! To top it all out I order cocoberry sake cocktail & it just topped my dinner! Will be back to try other creative dishes."}
{"text":"What kind of dim sum restaurant tells you that there is no more dim sum? The restaurant couldn't keep up with the orders so they just decided to shut it down for the day, and of course she told us this after waiting 15 minutes to be seated. Couldn't tell you how the quality of food was because I didn't bother. By the way it was 5pm in the afternoon. I'll try again in a month and see if they have adjusted."}
{"text":"The food was delicious...other than that I wouldn't recommend the place. Service was horrible and it took forever. It was very understaffed."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Very small selection of dim sum available. Service was very poor. Restaurant is very pretty. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"We don't go to any other Chinese. This place has the best food and the best service. Thalia and Justin were awesome and so helpful. Their orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp are to die for. Just Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is great!  Service is always good and the food is fantastic.  Their steak is amazing and always tender. I definitely recommend the black pepper beef steak."}
