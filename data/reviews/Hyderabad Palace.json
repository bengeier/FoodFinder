{"text":"Great chicken 65 and Irani Chai! Friendly service, but a bit slow.   If you're missing a taste of home, come here.   I haven't tried anything else. Slower service but still, really good food."}
{"text":"True hyderabadi biryani that you would get in Hyderabad or Karachi. I hope they introduce more dishes from Hyderabad."}
{"text":"I had to try the food at Hyderabad Palace.  Why not, I was recommended to this place by two people during my discussion about restaurant etc.  Dishes: Chicken Biryani layered with basmati rice with herbs, fried onion, saffron cooked in a traditional Style.  Dam Ka Murgh boneless chicken cooked in curd, spices, almonds, cashew nuts, saffron and herbs.  Naan and Caramel pudding. The food wasn't like the spicy hot Pakistani and Sri Lankan foods that my palate has grown accustomed with.  Not as spicy nor hot. The Kam Ka Murgh is sort of light Guyanese curry with an Indian infusion. I could taste the freshness of the food, meat cooked perfectly and so was the sauce of the Kam Ka Murgh.  The naan was the usual. The Caramel pudding was sort of the Guyanese caramel custard with a more pronounced caramel taste.  Overall the dishes were enjoyable.  My preference is for the more spicy hot dishes from India.  However, if I didn't like my food spicy hot, then Hyderabad Palace would suffice/"}
{"text":"This is a takeout only place.  Been getting biryani from this place for a month. This biryani is not the spicy type but its very flavouful, tastes home-made, the only thing is, its a bit too oily and the oil gathers at the bottom of the take out container, just don't eat the bottom rice.  Their Chicken 65 is very good as well. They have double ka meetha and Khubani ka meetha which not a lot of places carry. Its very well made and I find myself coming back for it repeatedly."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken biryani. Although very fresh... there was not much chicken on the chicken biryani. They can charge more and put more chicken imo. The rice was fresh and soft but the spices were not powerful at all. Just too weak...in fact even the salt was hardly there."}
