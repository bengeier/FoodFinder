{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times, as it is close to the hotel I stay at.  My experiences have ranged from ok to downright awful.  My first impressions were that the food was ok but grossly overpriced, and the service rather inept.  I went back last night, and had an ok dinner.  My first sign that something was wrong was when I ordered a glass of red wine.  It appeared that they had 2 or 3 bottles of wine in the place.  In an Italian restaurant??  Ok, the reality is that there are no Italians in this place, but really...  Next, asked for the soup of the day.  Chicken.  I ordered it.  Some time later I was informed that they were out of this soup, and offered me a couple of other choices.  It surprised me that they were out of the main soup, seeing as the place was empty.  I order the minestrone.  It tasted ok, but it was mostly broth and pasta.  Not much in the way of vegetables.  Overall, failing grade.  My entree was the roast chicken.  It was good, served with roast potatoes, vegetables, and salad.  Have to confess that it was very good.  The service was fine, although they do not offer basics such as ground pepper.  In fact, I did not even see salt and pepper shakers, but in fairness I was sitting at the bar.  Will I go back?  Probably.  There are only 2 restaurants within walking distance of my hotel, and I use this one when the weather is bad.  It was pouring last night, otherwise I would have gone to Hoops.  Better food and atmosphere.  If you are looking for something special, this is not the place to go.  It is fine for a drink, but for a dining experience, skip it."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this place was so bad I had to.  I went here with my girlfriend and another couple because we bought a groupon which included 2 appetizers and 4 entrees.    First of all, this \"restaurant\" was in the Monte Carlo Inn hotel lobby, it consisted of about 10 tables & a bar.  I made reservations beforehand, but later found it there was no need to, because it was completely empty.  I now know why.  When we arrived, we were not greeted by anyone.  I had to go up to the manager who was the only one there and inform him we had reservations.  After that he showed us to our a table, all the tables there were identical and made for 2 people, so it was a little small seeing how there were 4 of us.   So we ordered 2 appetizers. Calamari & Crab Cakes.  The bread that was brought out was stale, the Calamari was bland no flavour at all.  The crab cakes were ok, but they forgot the shrimp & scallop skewers on the dish, so my friend brought it to their attention.  The manager didn't know they were suppose to be on there so he said he'll go check.  He then came out with a plate of 2 skewers, and just when I was about to take a bite I noticed the shrimp and scallop were still raw!!!  My friend again brought this to his attention, and he brought another one out promptly with no apology.  Then came the entrees, we ordered the Salmon, Fillet Mignon, Striploin, and Rack of Lamb, all meat temperatures were suppose to be medium.  Salmon was dry, Fillet was still walking, striploin was overcooked, and the lamp was the only one they got right.  We asked them to cook the Fillet a bit more, all the food had the same sauce, sides, and seasoning.  Definitely not worth the menu price, even the groupon price wasn't worth it.    We then asked for the bill and 15% gratuity was already included.  If you bought a groupon for this place I strongly suggest you get a credit and buy something else.  I wish I read a review like this before I wasted my money on this place."}
