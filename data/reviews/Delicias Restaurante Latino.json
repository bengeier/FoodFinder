{"text":"this place is amazing! 2 baleadas, 2 pupusas, 2 coffes and juice $13.00! I I will always come back and you can tell all the food is fresh! and they have real hondurian hot sauce"}
{"text":"Their papusas are AMAZING!!! The service is great and the ladies are so very friendly! I would highly recommend. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good food.  Clean, welcoming environment. Lots of comfortable seating, but often full of people!  This is a restaurant Latinos come to for Latin food. Fair prices.  Mixed menu: Honduran, Mexican and Salvadoran food.  Servers speak mostly Spanish, but they are very helpful and friendly.  The menu is mostly in Spanish.  FYI the menu abbreviation c/u stands for \"cada uno\" or \"each one.\" Food is delicious, especially the hand-made flour tortillas.  (But, don't try to buy a dozen to take home.  They charge $1.00 per tortilla!!)   Try the Baleada Especial Con Carne (a large flour tortilla taco with beans, eggs, beef, avocado, sour cream).  Just one is enough."}
{"text":"Very clean, well decorated and with nice wait staff.  I had the traditional breakfast with chorizo and it was amazing.  Will go again. It's very authentic.  You'll need some Spanish skills or patience.  They had great patience with my poor Spanish."}
{"text":"Okay... normally I will judge a place off of its chips and salsa. Because if you can't get that right well I mean you know... initially we were greeted with drink orders and chips and salsa. It seemed like the chips were half stale and half fresh. The fresh ones were actually really good LOL but the stale ones tasted  like they've been stale for days... I honestly was a little worried...  But that's where they redeemed themselves.   I ordered the cheese pupusas. And a carne asada Mexicana. Everything on that plate including the little pickles were absolutely delicious.  Everything tasted fresh and well made. The carne asada was well seasoned. I also ordered the melon juice and it was absolutely delightful. I'll be definitely going back there!"}
{"text":"I think this place was a 3.5. Food was decent and portions were good. Pretty basic Central American food, which is definitely what I went for, so I wasn't disappointed or impressed. I was not happy that the waitress spoke 0 English. My boyfriend (who luckily does speak Spanish) was immediately addressed, and the entire time the waitress was at our table she only looked at him, as if I wasn't there. At one point I asked for another plate and held my plate up, and she just looked at me like, \"sorry if you don't know Spanish you need to go somewhere else.\" Then she told my bf that her kids spoke English, but she didn't let them use it at home because she didn't want them to forget it. (Clearly she must know some English, she lives in Charlotte for crying out loud, and her kids go to school here.) She then asked him if my family was offended that I hadn't learned Spanish (even though his parents/Grandparents speak it). He gave me the watered down version, as he said it was good I couldn't understand because I wouldn't have liked the conversation. I just think that's very poor taste. If I was in her home country I could understand, but we are in the US and that was rude."}
{"text":"I came here for the $5 for $10 deal, and I'm hooked.   My bf said they have the best flan in town, I like the small empanadas filled with chicken or beef.   for $5 I can get 3 flan, 2 empanadas, and a small round colombian bread. Such a great deal!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan. Really helps to speak Spanish but the food is fantastic, fresh, and affordable. They sell beer but no liquor so sneak a flask of Patron in. :-)"}
{"text":"Great authentic food. I recommend the chicken tacos. The tortillas are all handcrafted and delicious! Not being able to speak Spanish was not an issue. There is always someone able to help should I need assistance ordering. They just remodeled and the new addition is very impressive."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIAS!!! I will definitely be returning to this gem. The one waitress could not speak english, but she jogged off to find the owner and he was very fast to take our order. Loved the service and people"}
{"text":"Food is great and service was too!  Plantains are to die for!  The red sauce that came with my grilled chicken was good and spicy!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place many many times I thought I give it a try. I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the fish, plantains, tacos and menudo and all was made fresh and extremely delicious. The service was excellent and friendly. One of the best eating out experiences I ever had. I will come back again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat !  The restaurant is nice and clean and the service is pretty great . I ordered the soup de res and two pupusas which were really tasty , I'll definitely come back here !"}
{"text":"¡Dios mío! This place is muy bien. Ted and I are on a mission to check out every authentic Latin place in east Charlotte and Delicias did not disappoint. Unlike some of the taquerias we've visited, this is more of a sit-down restaurant experience, complete with the requisite, bottomless chips and salsa. Only, these chips and salsa are the best you will ever eat! The chips are thicker and crunchier than most (I think they might be made from flour tortillas rather than corn) and the salsa is so flavorful and fresh with big pieces of tomatoes, cilantro and onions.   As per usual for our Saturday cheat days, we ordered way too much food. (I regret nothing.) We started with pupusas revueltas, tamales de pollo and cheese dip. The pupusas were my favorite dish of the day and came out piping hot, stuffed to the brim with chicharron and queso. The cabbage and pickled onions that came on the plate cut through the richness and added a fresh element to every bite. The cheese dip is not to be missed! It is thick and creamy and perfect with their crunchy chips, on top of the tamales, eaten all by itself with a spoon... You get the picture, I'm sure.  We were stuffed at this point but wanted to try more. So, we put in an order for una baleada de carne. I didn't really know what to expect but the pictures on the menu looked good, so we went for it. What arrived was a huge flour tortilla, stuffed with perfectly seasoned and cooked steak, avacado and... egg? Ok, we'll roll with it. I'm not an egg person but I loved every bite of the baleada. This would make an awesome breakfast!   Last but not least (for our waistline's sake, we really should have stopped with the baleada but I wanted something sweet) we ordered empanadas dulces. Made with plantain pastry, stuffed with a sweet milk custard and dusted with sugar, this is the stuff desert dreams are made of.    A few other notes... Don't pass up ordering one of their aguas frescas. I had the Nance on this visit -- nance is a little, orange fruit typical of Latin America. In drink form it tasted like a mix between peach, pineapple and nectarine. It was deliciously light and sweet and refreshing! Service was outstanding. A team of 5 or 6 ladies worked together to cover a packed restaurant full of diners and left us wanting for nothing. Plus, they were super patient with my really bad Spanish.   We're looking forward to many future visits to Delicias to work our way through their awesome menu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute gem. It's in a plaza off of Albemarle road and seems to be in a little rough area of town, but it is so worth it. It is not your average Mexican (not Tex-Mex) restaurant! The store is not very big, but they seem to be serving authentic dishes and sticking to their culture. They have some Mexican dishes, but it is a Salvadorian and Honduran place, so there are so many new dishes to try! Price wise, they are suuperr affordable. We ordered 4 different plates and the total was around $34. The \"chips and salsa\" that comes out at the beginning is not the same as what you get at other restaurants - the salsa here is more of a liquid sauce and the chips are so thick and delicious!! My tacos de pescado were so F* good, the pupusas were also to die for (we had cheese and pork). My party also ordered steak tacos and steak fajitas and there were no complaints. I wish I wasn't as full as I was, so that I could have ate more! I WANT TO GO BACK RIGHT NOW!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood to try a new Latino restaurant for breakfast one Sunday, and came across Delicias on Yelp.  I'm happy to say that their food is amazing, and despite the distance from our home, we can't wait to return!  I had the Baleadas Especiales, without meat.  It's like a quesadilla, but made with a thicker--and obviously homemade--flour tortilla.  This Baleadas was filled with scrambled eggs, cheese, beans, sour cream, and avocados.  At just $4 for one (very filling for this gal!), I was very pleased.    Delicias serves their dishes with two sauces in ketchup and mustard containers.  The yellow container has a milder tomatillo sauce, and the red one has a spicier red sauce (but not too spicy for me).  Both were delicious, and I ended up mixing them on top of my Baleadas for added flavor.  My husband had the Chilaquiles Especiales Mexicano with fried eggs, beans, fried tortilla chips covered in a red sauce (it tasted similar to the one in the ketchup bottle), cheese, sour cream, and grilled chicken.  It was a huge serving, which was good since I snagged a few bites from his plate!  It was as tasty as mine, too.   Their coffee is strong and very good.  They'll ask if you want milk or cream.  We asked for cream, and got the powdered Cremora.  So, if you prefer a liquid creamer, ask for milk!  The restaurant is larger inside than I expected.  Maybe they expanded into adjacent space?  It was also bright, cheery, and nicely decorated.  Service couldn't have been any better, either.  Several servers assisted with our table, and everyone was pleasant, very friendly, and helpful.  I can't wait to return for dinner to try their puposas, kabbobs, and tacos!"}
