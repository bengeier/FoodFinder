{"text":"YES!  The company I work for just moved into a new building a few days ago and I was so pleased to see that there is a little sandwich shop taking up residence in the building also.  My co-workers got sandwiches the first day and all claimed they were great.  Just standard fare but a decent amount of meat with fresh bread and fixin's.  $5 with tax included is great considering the proximity and that it is not a chain by any stretch.  This morning I got a breakfast bagel sandwich.  PERFECT.  They have a large assortment of fresh bagels (I chose sesame) and the sammy have a good amount of nice fluffy scrabled eggs, with ham, bacon and cheese.  MAN was it good.  You couldn't put those ingredients together any better.  It was a whopping $3.25  They also havebreakfast burros, salads, the regular speard of cold sammies and a few hot sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu is great. The daily specials are always the bomb. Service is excellent. Joe is the man!"}
{"text":"Sami is the best!  His food is awesome and his personal touch is well worth a daily stop! I love the breakfast sandwiches and burritos... and all the sandwiches are phenomenal, especially the BLT with avocado and cheese!  Thanks Sami!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this little place!  The prices are reasonable and the food and service are great.  It's a nice walk from my office, past the ducks and turtles who are enjoying the pond.    I am so happy to be able to support Sammy and his small business without sacrificing anything!"}
{"text":"Great lunches served by great people.  Sami is retiring at the end of the year but the place will live on with a new owner, the same team and some new menu items."}
{"text":"Delicious mixed deli food with Middle Eastern and Mexican and little Italian very small, clean place go try it it's delicious."}
{"text":"For great breakfast or lunch make a quick stop here and you will not be disappointed.  Amazing breakfast sandwiches, fresh bagel and cream cheese, best BLT (comes with avocado!) I've ever had. Sami the owner is always on location and makes sure you are taken care of.  The food is fresh, delicious, and very well priced!"}
