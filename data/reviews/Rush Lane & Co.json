{"text":"We had a great time here last night! Recommended by a friend who had been in over the weekend and they were still raving about it at work this week so I decided to check it out. When we got there it was buzzing. Great vibe with great music.

We sat at a table near the bar to be part of the action! 

I ordered the Beat It I think it was called. It was one of the best drinks I've ever had! I don't normally order 2 of the same drink off of a cocktail menu but I went for seconds with this one. My friend had the Daniels Hammer. Also an amazing drink! I tried her second drink, the Kashmir (while I was working on my way through my second Beat It) and all I can say that it was as good as the other 2.

For our 3rd round we each had a beer.

All in all it was a fantastic night out. We were made to feel very welcome, the drinks were incredible and the service was very friendly. The server chatted with us for a while and told us all about the ingredients that are made in house - in a \"cocktail lab\" he said.

I'll definitely be coming back with friends to try the rest of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW GOES SPECIFICALLY FOR RUSH LANE's KITCHEN POP-UP \"EL LIMON\"

\"I am Peruvian and went to this place to try the Peruvian popup restaurant \"El Limón\", I was really excited to have what I thought it would be a proper typical meal. I ordered ceviche and it was more of a creamy salad with fried calamari and other seafood (very far from the freshness Peruvian Ceviche is known for). My wife ordered a \"Pan con Chicharrón\" (BBQ pork sandwich) which was 70% fat, we thought there was a mistake and decided to complain. They explained with terrible manners that's how the do it. Then the chef, Elias Salazar, came to our table with confrontational attitude, of course he said \"sorry you didn't like it, can I bring you something else?\" But it was evident he was upset.
Over all the experience wasn't pleasant portions were also small and overpriced, which I don't mind if I get the real deal.
Don't get fooled, if you wanna get a real Peruvian meal you still need to drive a little further to Montreal or NYC, Toronto sadly is not there yet IMHO\""}
{"text":"Solid spot with delicious cocktails. A little expensive but the pours are quite generous (most cocktails are advertised to use 2.5-3 ounces of booze). Not sure if they're being honest with the alcohol content but the drinks are definitely strong. I'd recommend the Green Goddess. Delicious. Nice decor and the guys behind the bar are friendly and very knowledgable when it comes to mixology. It's a chill atmosphere and is perfect for a pre/post dinner drink with your significant other. They have a few spots where larger groups can hang out but it was pretty relaxed the night I was there. Most drinks are between 12-16$ so bring your wallet."}
{"text":"It's Queen Street West and there are no shortage of places to enjoy a nice cocktail. That being said, I will be sure to skip this one next time and encourage as many people to Rush on past Rush Lame and head to the next spot. As a an ex-bartender and lover of libations, i feel as though my opinion of the rude and pompous douche of a bartender is well warranted. A few friends and I crossed the city after a game with hopes of enjoying a few no-cheap yet well-made cocktails at this spot, however, what we got more of were rules and insults and just plain shitty service. I probably should have known better right from the get go as there was a completely unnecessary doorman clad with a clicker (nightclub?) that asked my friends to remove their hats and toques before entering the half filled room of boring adults. It's the dead of winter in Ontario and we are being asked to remove our hats! And for no obvious reason other than perhaps the bearded \"king\" behind the bar. I'd be lying if I said that these guys didn't make a good cocktail but not sure why it has to be served with so much attitude? I don't remember any of them being free if that even be some acceptable form of exchange. I think my breaking point, however, was when the said cocktail master decided to rudely interrupt my friend and I to tell him he was spilling drink \"all over the place\". Should this have been in a polite manner, we would have been far more appreciative. 

In reading some of the other reviews for this place, I realize what a contrast mine is in comparison. Nonetheless, I don't think I will be returning to this place and would sooner forfeit the sophistication of an innovative cocktail for service that is genuine and reliable."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp allowed 0/5 stars. 
This place was a joke, mainly the staff. The bartender tried to tell me a drink was double the menu price because there are two ounces in the cocktail... Worst place I've ever been. 
I've been bartending for over 8 years. I have never wanted to fight a bill until this experience. These guys really shouldn't be working in this industry. *If anyone knows about hospitality, it's about a good experience that makes you want to come back. Well, this place couldn't be farther from hospitable. In fact, it would be better described as a douchebag scum pool filled with regrets. Literally DO NOT GO HERE.  This place needs to be SHUT DOWN. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, takes 30 minutes to receive a drink. Come here if you have an extra 3 hrs to spare. Bartenders all extremely rude."}
{"text":"Cool spot.

The hubby and I had some time to kill before our dinner reservation on the Labour Day Sunday, and decided to pop in for a drink.  

Good choice, us!  

Decor is definitely what you'd expect of a bar in the neighbourhood, with their roll-up garage door windows, DIY lighting, 70's retro and super-Modern furniture mashup.  Good separation of spaces [bar, lounge, tables], tasteful bathrooms, etc.  Neat spot, but not the reason you'd come back.

You come back for the cocktails.

Simon & Danny, the owner/bartenders of Rush Lane, are a couple of young, cool guys with years of industry experience under their belts.  Simon also spins the occasional night, and their cocktail game is ON POINT.  

We had a 'Beat it' and what was either a 'Daniel's Hammer' or the one with the name I can't read [you'll know what i mean when you see it], and both were superb.  I'm not even going to try and explain what's in each one, because i wouldn't be able to do it justice.  Suffice it to say, the recipe and process sounds like something concocted by either a gourmet chef or a mad scientist,... or both.  Ever heard of a tissue-tearer?  Neither had I until Simon showed us one he was using for the recipe.  O_o Who knew?  Oh, and there's a full-on science lab in the back.  

At this point, I started getting munchy so we ordered a foie gras to share.  Presentation was lovely [there were FLOWERS on my foie gras!  Flowers!], and while the foie gras was decent [we've had some excellent foie gras, so a little spoiled], the real winner was the watermelon.  I mean, the watermelon RIND.  

...don't ask, just try it.  It's awesome.    
   
Great spot, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for a friends birthday and had a great experience. The cocktails are amazing, they may seem pricey at first but the bartenders don't skimp on the alcohol and they also taste great. I tried the 'a trip through the slums', 'sante', and 'that night' cocktails and they all tasted yummy. We also tried a couple of the food options which were all snack sized and perfect for sharing, I recommend the potato wedges, chicken bites, and meatballs. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the slow service but our waiter was very nice nonetheless."}
{"text":"I went to Rush Lane last Wednesday with 3 friends (one of whom joined us maybe 15 minutes after we sat down).  I'm getting ahead of myself though.  My two friends and I had been waiting outside chatting for a bit before entering the restaurant.  When we finally went inside, we looked around first because we weren't sure if we should just sit at any table or wait for someone to seat us.  At the back of the restaurant, three of the bartenders were standing and chatting and they actually looked over at us (and then away from us, as one of my friends informed me) without greeting us or helping us to get settled in.  We took our seats anyway and actually had a short discussion about whether or not to leave.  We decided to stay once our fourth friend confirmed she was still coming but not to order any of the food items (obviously we wanted to try the cocktails but didn't want to spend more given the service).

After what seemed like a very long time, one of the bartenders finally  came over to greet us.  Luckily, he was friendly enough.  He was also helpful in advising us on which cocktails to order.  I ordered the Daniel's Hammer (the one with the vodka that is banned in the States, apparently).  Two friends ordered the Beat It and one ordered the Chai-Tai.  The Daniel's Hammer was sort of \"grassy\" or \"green\" in taste but I liked it (the bartender described it as sweet and savory, which it was).  My friends liked their Beat It's.  I'm not sure how much my fourth friend liked her Chai-Tai since she took very long to finish it.  
We ended up staying at Rush Lane for perhaps 1.5 hours, much longer than I had anticipated but we were really enjoying our conversation.  The waitress who stopped by to process our bills was also pleasant.

The washrooms are clean.  I liked the garage door window at the front.  Ambiance - definitely HIPSTER!  Can't say anything about the food (obviously).  I'm not going to write off Rush Lane or the staff completely - I would return and I HOPE that they will be more welcoming."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place as I love a good cocktail but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. 

Super slow service (and rude). Not to mention I ordered a Martinez and received some weird drink with absinthe in it. The hell?!"}
{"text":"Straight up reason for 3 stars: expectations exceeded reality. 

For a place that has \"bespoke cocktails\" and a lab to perform \"cocktail alchemy\", which are backed up with an appropriately bespoke price, and a bartender with a beard and suspenders, this place falls a bit short. 

Don't get me wrong, the cocktails are good. But the selection when I went was waaay too sweet. Maybe it was the recipe or the bartender - don't know. The driest cocktail they had that night was the Siege of Troy, which while tasty was still close to cloyingly sweet.  Overly sweet was a consensus with our party. 

I can say that it did not taste like something concocted in an  alchemists lab by a Gandalf amongst mixologists. I don't mind choosing from a fixed menu, but if I do, the drink better give me a mindgasm.

Or maybe they need a bartender with a waxed moustache and arm garters. 

If decor is important, it looks like they spent money on the place, but somehow lost sight of what they were going for, and ended up with the a-bar-in-downtown-Toronto look. 
The actual bar where drinks are made is pretty gorgeous, and the lab looks cool, but would be cooler they went with an open concept look. 


On the plus side, the large format beer selection was excellent, and our server was friendly, fast, and attentive without being intrusive, even on a busy Saturday night. 

The doorman was pretty awesome too. 

So long as the company is good, I'd probably give this place another shot, but for anyone else: come here or don't. If you like it you'll stay, if not there are plenty of other bars nearby."}
{"text":"RushLane has been open just a few weeks and I am already really excited to see what they do next.  The staff is enthusiastic and clearly love what they do...most of the bar staff are RushLane owners, so they really care about your experience and are always keen to know how things can be done better.

If you are looking for a safe bet for a date or a meet up with friends, RushLane delivers with great atmosphere, and amazing drinks and food.  They also experiment with new cocktail and food creations regularly, so the adventuresome person will not be disappointed!  I myself am not a great lover of fish/seafood, so I was pleasantly surprised to find I LOVED RushLane's fish dish when I sampled it with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Sophie was crude rude and charged us for hot water will never return .. No wonder there was no line and no cover"}
{"text":"I love this place and it may be my new hang out.  Super friendly atmosphere and some super cool cocktails. Music is at a nice conversational level. I recommend the red/beat cocktail (forgot name but I'm sure it will be easy to ask for) and sitting by the aquarium watching the fishies!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem prides itself on its cocktail selection & creation -- and it delivers on that promise. While the food menu may not be extensive, the kitchen rises to the challenge of matching what the bar does. We sampled the entire menu; each dish was perfect. 

The real surprise here is the level of service. Will led the charge on handling our large group walk-in like a pro, and all staffers demonstrated a desire to make our outing a positive experience. A memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Finally an actual cocktail bar with awesome drinks AND awesome food. 

Love how the cocktail menu evolves and changes keeps me wanting to try new things. Not only are the cocktails amazing (a beet cocktail with gin? What? Yes it's delish) the food is stellar too!!!

Snack style food but so insanely creative and delicious. Rush Lane just explodes with flavor, creativity and uniqueness. Try the halibut, the \"wing\" which is really a medieval drumstick and then the crazy pogo stick thing. 

Just wish there was a patio!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, cocktails and snacks. 
I have a handful of favourites that are off menu - just get the crew to create something for you based on what you're feeling. I do however, love The Kenhattan - named after a friend of mine."}
{"text":"Argueably the best bar in Toronto. Unique novel cocktails to the classics made to perfection. Staff are amazing and make you feel welcome. Decor is awesome and check out that \"lab\" at the back. Awesome food right now too!"}
{"text":"We were sent here for drinks while we waited for seats at BarChef. 

The drinks were average. The Paper Plane and Toronto cocktail (rye whiskey based drink) were both ok. The Aussie Fries were awesome! 

The music was great. The bartender that made our drinks had a bit of an attitude and was too busy playing behind the bar with other staff. Maybe this is why the drinks were not as good. We were able to kill some time and listen to some good hip hop so it worked out."}
{"text":"This was a nice little gem of a find. I'm not generally the small, intimate bar type, but I did enjoy my time here. The service was very friendly and accommodating. The vibe was relaxed, trendy, though a touch loud. And the food and drinks were awesome! I was introduced to a paper plane, which is pretty good, and bonus points to the bartender for getting me to try something new. For food we shared the pulled pork nachos, the dirty rice, and the porridge dish. The nachos were so good! I'm lactose intolerant but I had a time with these. I think they make their own chips too. The dirty rice was also quite good, but a touch salty. I didn't take much to the porridge but my friends quite liked it. Overall, this place is worth a visit, and I'd go again."}
{"text":"Cute bar! I had an awesome cucumber gin drink that wasn't on the menu but my friend recommended and the bartender whipped it up for us. They were kind of the expensive side, I think 16 CAD a pop, but delicious and I would get it again! Cute atompshere also."}
{"text":"This place is place is a lovely atmosphere. It is a little too pricey for it to be a spot I go on the reg but if it's a special date or intimate night and you can afford it it is quite nice. The setup and design are  very chique and modern. Service was very attentive and conversational too. It's just waaY to out of my price range I'm willing to pay for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Yes, they've got an interesting cocktail menu and a relaxed lounge-like vibe, but what impressed me most about Rush Lane & Co was the staff. 

The staff and managers extremely down-to-earth and helpful - which is often not the case for most Queen Street West bars.

I hosted a 10-person birthday party at Rush Lane & Co on a Thursday night. I contacted their staff in advance to make a reservation and the service I got was really top-notch .

I initially chose Rush Lane because of the space. I wanted a patio experience without having to worry about rain (Toronto weather can be unpredictable). At Rush Lane, they open the giant garage-like doors at the front so that you feel like you're on a patio even though you're indoors. It's great for people watching."}
{"text":"Ambiance/service is pretty meh, but cocktails and the ridiculous scotch selection are great.  I'd say they're $1-3 more than your average bar, but that's probably because of the location.

The real star of this place is the three month pop-up: Limon Peruvian Kitchen.  My girlfriend is Peruvian and she attested to how on point the meals are.  There is a serious lack of inspiring Peruvian cuisine in Toronto and we were both impressed.  A personal favourite of mine is the huancaina and papas (basically their cheesy/spicy sauce on potatoes).  The ceviche de pulpo was fantastic as well, although my gf barely left me any to try.  I really hope the team here moves forward to open a restaurant after their three month stay.  A shame the bar staff did not promote the food menu whatsoever.

Rush lane gets 3 stars at best, Limon gets 5."}
{"text":"Well that was a let down. Came here with my friend Wednesday night looking for a great cocktail. This place looked cool from the outside and it's definitely true what they say- never judge a book by its cover. 

Where to begin? How about when we first walked in and were judged by the 5 guys sitting...or should I say hanging out the window. I felt like I was 20 and back in university. In fact, everything about this place screams \"look at me\"- from the empty fish tank to the drunk girls sitting on the couch pounding back beers. Or how about the bartenders who insist on shaking their shakers like shakira shakes her hips (and watching themselves in the mirror while doing it). I feel like this place was filled with people who wanted to be seen but couldn't get in anywhere else. 

Looking around I should've taken the hint: every person in there was drinking a beer- but this is a cocktail bar, right?! So let's try these \"great\" cocktails. My friend asked for a bourbon based cocktail- the waitress was quick to say they didn't have any (nor do they offer to free style you one or suggest an alternative). So we ordered the \"beat it\" and...because I can't remember it we will simply refer to the second cocktail as \"morning after in the streets of New Orleans\"...Believe me- if you smelled or tasted this cocktail you would completely understand. 

Both cocktails were undrinkable (ok, the beat it was a little more tolerable) and we left with half our drinks sitting in the glass (and no one asked if we enjoyed the cocktails or acted surprised when we asked for our bill so quickly). Mind you, this was 45 min after entering the bar because it took that long to get our drinks. Oh- and perhaps the undrinkable part had to  do with the fact I didn't see 1 bartender do a quality check. 

Speaking of bartenders- my favourite quote of the evening- \"the aromatics are sweet- you just gotta smell 'em\" as he wafts the smell of burnt hair into the patrons face. Amazing.  

If you are looking for 905- style crap cocktails- this is the place for you! My advice? Avoid at all costs and spend your money elsewhere- this place won't last long!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out bc of Kevin Santos's post!
it was good - came on a rainy evening so was kind of quiet
but we got seats on the leather chairs near the aquarium
staff was super nice!
we had the taters and another app - both were decent
the cocktails were strong - lots of options
the manhattan on top was not the best IMO - but cool concept!"}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full experience review!! 

\"Rush Lane utilizes one of the best ways to integrate into the neighbourhood and become a landmark - a custom storefront mural!\"

\"Their Popcorn Chicken was on a denser side, and spicy, even before swirling the bites in the side of kimchi aioli. There was an interesting texture to mention there, and all the goodness came in a bowl enough for one. Great value for a small starter snack\"

Just a few bites from our full experience review!!"}
{"text":"They have a great scotch selection and the staff are good at helping you find a new one if you are exploring. 
Sitting at the bar was nice for the interaction with knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"No monkey business with this place. Top notch/high quality ingredients, good service and cool/quirky atmosphere. Insta-worthy and very relaxed. The aesthetic and décor is kind of retro. You may feel like you're in another era. Bartenders are welcoming, know their stuff and are serious about their craft. I always come back to this joint because it has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came across this bar on BlogTo's 2014's to Bars. It's a trendy hipster place which a large array of cocktails. A good place to go when you want to hang out with friends. i don't usually drink cocktails but since I was at one of the top bars in Toronto, I decided to have my first Old Fashioned Cocktail and it was delicious. They take a lot of care when making their drinks and are extremely knowledgeable over a variety of drinks they can recommend you."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails with a casual vibe.  

I came here with 3 friends on a Saturday night and we managed to sit by the window with the large, open garage doors right on Queen Street. I ordered 2 drinks:

- Sex Panther ($16): Although delicious with strong lavender flavours, I found that there was a little too much egg white topping off the cocktail, as compared to the lavender cocktail from Bar Chef. 
- The Last Word ($14): One of my favourite cocktails to date. It was refreshing and sweet at the same time, filled with a large cucumber/apple garnish inside of the cup. Definitely recommend this if you like light and fruity cocktails.

The bar is definitely busier in the first part of the night (around 9PM - 11PM) with groups of people pre-drinking before going out. During this time, it was hard to get service from the waitresses because of the large groups. However as the groups started to clear out, the service improved a lot. 

Overall, Rush Lane has some of the best cocktails in Toronto and the atmosphere isn't too formal."}
{"text":"Awful.  Bar stools were super uncomfortable.
Place was basically empty - only two other people there - and the bartender did not even acknowledge us.  Not at all a welcoming place.
Had to ask for menus - were given tattered, nasty, \"menus\". 
Cocktails were too expensive - food options were non-existent.
We just left without even enduring anymore at this place.
This spot is a big NO."}
{"text":"This place has gone from bad to worse.
The bartender I've had the joy of coming across more than once is a total douche. Not sure why he's here, hating people and life and all. 
Damn. I ended up walking out. Never ever returning. It's off my list forever. 
-------------------------------------

I've been here a few times. 
Sloooow service. 
Sloooow. The drinks aren't bad once they arrive. 
Seating is uncomfortable (wooden chairs and booths) minus one sofa on the \"upper level\" and a padded arm chair. 
Vibe is meh. Lighting is brighter than it needs to be. And the front is cold and drafty. Brrr.
I know I'll be back only because of the location and it's easy."}
{"text":"Been twice.  Two stars for quality cocktails.  Five stars in fact.  Minus those stars for mediocre service.  

If I'm sitting at the bar, paying $40 for two drinks, I'd like a bartender who is interested in my presence.  The two behind the bar were far more interested in their crew, and were disdainful of my attempt to engage them in a discussion on drinks - which is why I'm willing to pay this much FOR a drink in the first place.

The space is cool, the spirits great, but I can make great drinks at home too, and have better conversations by myself.

The cocktail lab is pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience at rushlane.

The six of us came on a December Friday night and found the place empty. Which is fine, just means plenty of seat options and no need to yell for a conversation. We have a pretty wide taste in alcohol so we all gravitated to different parts of the extensive menu. However, we soon found out that they didn't have most of what we wanted. They were missing something from each of their flights - so no flights. My friend asked for a specific vodka on their menu - didn't have it. We asked if there was any food - no food. And when we asked for our bills - no split bills. 

For a place that is advertised as a bar and gastropub, they really didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Service is slow.  We went to try the pop-up Peruvian restaurant.  All the prices that they show in their website are different (way higher) than  what they actually charge. The price for the Huancaina Papas in the website is $6 and for the anticuchos $9.  We paid $11 and $14 for those dishes.  The papa a la huancaina was ridiculously small and not so great.  The anticuchos were very tasty.  We also ordered an empanada, a little greasy and that was not Peruvian style.  They should update the prices in their website."}
{"text":"Visited this bar on a Saturday night. It was a fairly small place on Queen Street with food, drinks and Nintendo games to offer. The drinks are all handmade and very tasty (no syrups added). I ordered the margarita which was very refreshing and not sweet at all! It was the perfect drink for a hot summers night. The only downside to this place is that they do not have air conditioning. Since there were so many people inside, the place is fairly small and the fact that it was very hot out, everyone was getting very sweaty and smelly. I would definitely come back if they offered a more comfortable atmosphere (AC and more seating)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rush Lane because of the bar staff. They USED TO make the atmosphere... Super creative guys that had a passion for bartending. Saturday night was full but not crowded. I asked one of the bartenders for help with a shot, he said 'no' directly to me, and then turned away to talk to his buddies at the bar. I'm really disappointed by this gesture because they hadn't been in the business of being rude in the past, and that's why I had followed them from when they worked at Spirit House. I guess they're tired of being friendly now. 

On to the next one."}
{"text":"Came to this place because a friend wanted to check it out and I am very impressed with the quality that they offer. They have manhattan's in tap which are pretty good and they make some very interesting cocktails. I would recommend this place as a starting point or as a date spot as it is really spot. 

The staff are really friendly and they know what they are doing. 

You need to try this place and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"been here too much to be honest - drinks are always too sweet to my liking.  Mario Kart is a nice touch.

Staff attitude is laughable - could they be more cliche.  Like a bad Portlandia episode."}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere. Friendly bartenders. Excellent, strong drinks."}
{"text":"Good cocktails. There's no criticism there.

The place has the potential to be excellent. But there's just a frustrating serving shortfall going on here that prevents this place from really living up to it's full potential. Minor things that add up like - staff busy with themselves rather than their guests - staff not explaining drinks - staff not interested in settling up tabs - staff not clearing glasses - staff acting quite arrogant and boasting about a $1,500 ice cube maker. It all ironically leaves a sour taste in your mouth. It's just not the right vibe at all when you're ok spending New York prices on drinks - thank-full that you're in Toronto and don't have to deal with a New York attitude - and then realize your bartenders behave like they are in New York. 

I'd chalk it up to one off experiences, but sadly it's been pretty consistent on my recent two visits, both midweek on slow nights."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Fresh and original. Go there for that reason; meet Ger who is behind a lot of the magic and really passionate about the craft."}
{"text":"Ask for a Smoked Tobacco Old Fashioned. Trust me. Told the server I was a big Manhattan drinker, and asked for something 'different'. After bringing the drink, he proceeds to explain how he made the drink in exceptional detail, including resting the glass over a smoking cedar plank before pouring. 

This is where you can appreciate the art of cocktail making. An artist made my drink. And his name is Zak."}
{"text":"4 stars for yummy cocktails, awesome bartenders, a fish tank and Nintendo games. I came here on one of my bar hops around Toronto and genuinely had such a fun time. 

This spot can be hard to miss because it's squished in between two larger restaurants/bars and there's not really any signage outside. But nonetheless, it's there, and it's worth a quick visit! The space is fairly small. A few tables at the front, a small mini lounge with two couches right next to the fish tank, and then plenty of bar seats along the long bar. 

God, people in Toronto just know how to make people feel so welcome. Coming from Vancouver, I thought we had a friendly nightlife scene, but it's nothing in comparison to Toronto. I sat at the bar waiting for my friends and quickly started up a conversation with the bartenders and those sitting around me. Everyone was so nice! 

I didn't come here to get any food, but I saw that they had a few food options. Could be a good spot to grab a quick bite and drink if you're looking for options down Queen St. W. 

I asked the bartender to make me his favorite drink and all I know is that it had whiskey in it. It was strong and tasty, just the way I like it! Right after that, I switched things up and decided to try the \"Harvey Has A Horrible Coat\" which had something of a mix of tequila, sherry, cucumber, simple syrup and maraschino liqueur. Now that was good. 

My favorite part of this bar? Their N64 right next to the bar. While enjoying a good cocktail I was able to enjoy a game of the OG Mario Kart. Awesome.

Thanks for a fun night, Rush Lane!"}
{"text":"Contrary to what some people had posted, I had fantastic service when I came here. The staff was really helpful and knowledgeable and walked us through all the cocktails.

The whisky cocktail with chilli flakes was divine- the perfect mix of sweet, sour and spicy (Jimmy and Eddie Get Spicy). However, some of the sweeter drinks were a little disappointing. The Slim Hip Stacy, for instance, I would not recommend unless you like a really dessert-y drink.

Overall the vibe was fantastic. It's a great spot to hang out and drink."}
{"text":"Been here 3x, and each time I come in it's very bland. Nothing exciting, nothing out of the ordinary. Their cocktails are a little too sweet for my liking, and pricey for what it is in my opinion.

It's a place to go for a weeknight drink with an old friend to catch up over long overdue chats. The place is fairly quiet, and small.

But there are better places to go than here..."}
{"text":"I had a Rum cocktail, my friend had one from Gin. Both distinct and so elegant. 

I also loved the Scottish bartender, he was polite and attentive but with that awesome \"I don't really care about you mate\" part of the European demeanor. As a North American I'm used to a bartender working you for tips, it was a relief to be treated with such relative disregard hahaha.

I'll go back next time I make it to that side of Canada."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but the last time I came it left me with a sour taste. Drinks were good as usual however the staff's service needs improvement. Even though the place was relatively empty they were quick to dash away from our table. Our cheque was brought before we were even done the night, and when we asked for the cheque to be split our server was sassy and seemed like he wanted to be elsewhere. We will be visiting another establishment next time."}
