{"text":"Great place to come eat with the family and friends. the tacos are delicious and they are $2 not bad, definitely worth your money! I love the horchata, its bomb! They have great service, and are welcoming. They also have breakfast and free coffe, definitely 6 stars for them!"}
{"text":"Very good! They have new food on the menu. And the best part , they are open 24hrs!.. my plate was only 5.99 and its a lot of food on the plate plus the tortillas. 100% recommended"}
{"text":"Update: Alright, I went back. The cashiers were nice this time, but the food still sucks and it doesn't look like management is going to do anything about it. Stop making your food with the cheapest ingredients you can find, and actually try giving a shit about your customers. Maybe then you'll get more customers.   Henry out."}
{"text":"Called for delivery, was given a half coherent answer of \"No one is here today...\". They weren't too interested in the concept of time. I did not call late, it was 5 pm on a Monday. I guess order your tacos on any other day but Monday......."}
{"text":"Inedible. I got a carne asada burrito to go and the meat was disgusting...it was mostly gristle and cartilage, and the chunks that were chewable were dry, tough, and flavorless. I live nearby and try to support local business, but I'm going to stick with Chipotle and Cafe Rio until something else comes along. Gross."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak burrito that was pretty plain, skimped on the steak pieces but there was plenty of plain beans no taste at all, I can cook a better burrito than this joint, won't be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Never disappointed every time I came here for lunch! Food always taste great !!! Their green sauce was the bomb, to kill and die for !!!!!!!  Owner, very nice guy. People behind the counter, very accommodating.  I've become a loyal customer !!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is great, I stopped by on my way home craving Mexican food and thought, why not. Other than having great service they have a large selection of food within their menu. Definitely a highly recommended place to go."}
{"text":"So good! We were vacationing on the strip and needed something different and not so expensive. Cilantros has amazing, quick food made to order. They even have a drive thru. Delicious, quality food hiding in an unassuming little building in a semi industrial area, this place is a win!  P.S their green sauce is super good!"}
{"text":"The food here is easily 5-star quality: great tacos of all kind, good meals and plates, and really friendly staff who were happy to accommodate a large group coming in all at once.   The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that once we overwhelmed them (there were only two people working), multiple mistakes were made on orders that were already taking awhile (though it should be said they were always quickly corrected). The food was worth the wait, but they just need a slightly better system to stay on top of orders.   Overall, can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"decided to try this place after finding it here on yelp its right down the street from tacos al Gordo which we usually go to and never saw its sort of hidden. Definitely try this place it's very clean they have drive thru and are very nice you can feel the love in this place!  Better yet my tacos came out nice and hot and the tortillas were thick and cooked right! They actually give you your money's worth definitely picking this over tacos al Gordo next time"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed! It was definitely a waste of money! The carne asada was very chewy and the chicken was very wet and made the tortillas soggy! I would never eat here again! Do not get the carne asada fries or the tacos! Horchata was good though! That's it!"}
{"text":"Excellent place, 5 star plus. Is neat, clean, friendly staff and Great food and I mean it. We went there for dinner last night and loved it. It is a small place and location is different but don't be fooled by that. No doubt best Tacos in vegas and their salsa is original recipe and so delicious. You must try this place."}
{"text":"Since I was in the mood for bomb a** tacos I read the reviews and decided to give this place a try... ordered a Carne Asada Torta and 2 Pastor tacos .. husband ordered Carne Asada Fries ... The Torta was great found some fat in the meat but I got over it and he really liked the fries.. the tacos on the other hand weren't so good.. they were dry and kinda burnt tasting.. I would go back but not for tacos.. and probably through the Drive thru cause its convenient and the service wasn't so great so no need to go back in. The young girl that took our order was nice but never asked how anything was or even if we needed anything.  Also there was an older lady at the counter (in a hot pink Kelly Bundy dress ) who I'm sure was an owner of the place that thought she was better than everyone who walked in and never smiled just stared at everyone and made you feel uncomfortable.  If youre looking for good tacos, Tacos El Gordo is next door it's always busy and fast paced but the tacos are better !!"}
{"text":"Greasy food, long wait but there were a lot of cars. I tried the carne asada and carnitas tacos. I didn't care for the Asada's seasoning and the meat was a bit dry. It was very greasy. The carnitas was fairly good although it was greasy too. I think I'll give them one other try. I liked the spicy cilantro sauce. I also got a side of beans. It was a lot and it tasted as if they came straight out of a can. I don't know if I'll try them again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food I've found on the North Side!!!! Open Early and Fast Delivery, no complaints so far... Food is awesome Nachos are amazing!!! a Must stop by and try place!!!"}
{"text":"We tried  -Tortas de lengua- and they were really good and they were bigger than I thought they were going to be! 100% coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Good size portions!  See pic of my asada fries."}
{"text":"OMG. AMAZING GUACAMOLE! fast deliver and everything was still warm and super delicious! !! I paid about $25 and received double the amount of food I was expecting.  so good! definitely my new favorite Mexican spot!!"}
{"text":"I live behind a Roberto's and will choose this restaurant over them from now on. First of all they deliver. Second, their proportions and ingredient quality is excellent. For example, with the carne asada nachos, they use nice fat fresh steak fries, they chop the steak finely, and give you slices of fresh avocado instead of the usual skimping of avocado mush. When getting a delivery they include salsas and condiments without you even asking. Basically this place has bomb ass food that they actually put care into making.  The only suggestion I'd make would be to change up your horchata. It's just not as on point as your Jamaica and the rest of your food. Overall, way better than your average taco joint by far."}
{"text":"Not happy with the food at all. They don't have fountain drinks. Over priced food. They don't trim the fat from the meat or re heat it. It's always chewy. And the funny thing is I got the carne asada french fries one time. And asked  for everything on it. And it only came with meat, tomatoes and cheese. Ha. What a joke. You think with the place named cilantro they would at least throw cilantro on it as well. I would rather take the time to drive to another restaurant. That has better cheaper food. I don't see them being open long."}
{"text":"Yet another subpar taqueria in a predominantly Hispanic 'hood with better options literally in the same parking lot. Prices are about average but quality is less than- corn tortillas were slick with grease, lengua was adequate but barbacoa was barely passble. $2 \"side\" of a beef tamale was okay, if a bit heavy on the masa. Doubt this place has what it takes to stay in business though."}
{"text":"While I've only ever ordered 1 item from their menu (vegan dinner burrito), I love their food! I've never gone inside to order or eat. I always either use the drive thru or use the recent delivery option. They recently changed the name and are going with Los Reyes. They also extended the hours, which is great! I just love the delivery option when I'm in a pinch working from home and need food quickly. They will deliver in under 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Easily recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious Hispanic food restaurant. Burritos are huge and the meat is as authentic as can be. Great prices and great service."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing reviews. Finally went today.I was pretty happy to see they have a drive-thru but its hard to see the enter sign. Its just behind the building. The voice intercom didnt work so I drove up the window. Employees are all very nice and helpful. Ordered and waited at the window for food. Did take a little while but I didnt mind. Ordered asada tacos for me. They were pretty good. Lots of meat,tortillas were soft and still really warm by the time I got home. Ordered chicken taco and al pastor taco for my little ones (didnt wanna order too much in case they didn't like it) Thats was a big mistake. They loved the tacos!! Which is awesome since thats a big factor in where we go eat. Salsas were very good but container are really small so if you like salsa ask for extra. Overall great place!! Will be back soon. Will dine in next time."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing place.  Owner was very friendly,  almost immediately upon walking in, he served us some complimentary tacos,  gave kids rice,  drinks,  etc.  It felt like he was welcoming us into his home!  Delicious food,  great price,  very neat and clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good food!!! The biggest carne adasa burrito I have ever seen in my entire life!!!! Seriously...like ever!!!"}
{"text":"Holy mother of all true amazing mexican tacos!!!!  The Asada was tender and slow cooked!"}
{"text":"Excelente servicio, la comida   %  Muchos restaurantes de comida Mexicana an perdido el verdadero sabor de nuestra comida tradicional por meter produce de baja calidad.  Lo importante es que (CILANTRO TACOS GRILL) A mantenido nuestro tradicional sabor Mexicano  (No es un restaurante  como los demás)  % recomendado"}
{"text":"Found it! This is definitely from Chicago, quick easy and good! Delivery was perfect and they come straight to my office WONDERFUL  Sooooooo needed steak tacos with cilantro and onion in my life and now I have it until I can get home!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this establishment three stars because the place was very clean and the people who was working there was very nice and they tried very hard.  The tacos was okay,  I had the chicken and it was very dry.  I also got a taco chille relleno, should have ordered a regular one.  The taco did not have much flavor.  I tried the red and green sauce and I liked them both."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and got the street tacos for $2. I got the asada and pastor tacos. They were bomb! They have quick and friendly service. The place is clean and very cozy. They have drive thru and they have take out. They also deliver. Gerardo is they coolest guy ever. The prices are reasonable and everything looks great. This is the best deal on this side of town. There is more parking in the back. I just saw they they also cater!! Come here and eat!!   Major plus, they serve Coke products and the Mexican Coke!!"}
{"text":"It was ok! A big turn off is the fact they microwaved the rice and beans (I watched). The tortillas Are heated in the same area they cook meat and they were covered in oil.  There was a massive pile of cheese on beans which is unnecessary. Very slow getting food out"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  This place has an entertainment coupon for buy one menu item get one free. So we make the trip to try them out. They refused to use the coupon from the entertainment app.  They made many excuses why they won't accept the coupon. Example: we will lose money, we will never see you again if we let you use the coupon.  I advised it can only be used once and if they are confident in quality of there food, they should not worry about us not returning.  There was nobody at the restaurant or the drive thru. They rather turn away business then honor there coupon.  They tried to say previous owners went under by offering promotions. Well sorry to break it to you sir, but your business will go under by trying to save a nickel instead of pleasing a potential new customer. There are good places in vegas to try that don't give customers such a hard time. As a long term yelp reviewer,  please read other places I recommend and avoid this establishment as they obviously don't care or know how to obtain new loyal customers."}
{"text":"I had a coupon that they would not except. I was told management changed and they no longer take valid coupons"}
{"text":"They tacos are good.   But they are a little slow on making your food.  For a fast food Mexican restaurant I would think they would be a little quicker not so much though."}
{"text":"I did not try the food.  When I walked in it smelled like \"old grease\" which turned me off instantly.   I went to the bathroom and noticed a huge stack of boxes on top of a cabinet.   It looked unstable as if it could easily be knocked over and upon closer inspection it was boxes of food serving containers and supplies(one could just look inside and see white plastic lids in a plastic bag)!   I find storage of food serving supplies in a bathroom disgusting.   I don't see how that is acceptable.   I was concerned about trying the food,  so I left."}
{"text":"What a great local spot!    I came in here for lunch while on break. I was pleasantly surprised by the Owner working the register and preparing the food. He said he just took over and was making a lot of changes.   I ordered a Asada Burrito. When I got it, he brought it out to me and man was I surprised! It was huge!  I was not only surprised by the size but on how great it tasted too!     I have since been back and the food has not been a disappointment at all! I  am highly recommending this place as a must go.   It's a  hole in the  wall, but it's a gem of a place to eat!"}
{"text":"There are huge signs all over the building that say \"OPEN 24 HOURS\" but when I went on Sunday 5-31-15 at 4am and they were closed.  Like, really closed.  Lights off, doors locked closed. Wish I could have tried the food."}
{"text":"They had no lemonade, nothing from the platillos menu. Orchata was gross. . My burrito was too salty.  I don't recommend this place!!!!!!"}
