{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The food is top notch and the service is excellent. The owner has a passion for his restaurant and it really shows. I absolutely love their chicken salads here and their pizza is mouthwatering. Everyone we have introduced to this place has nothing but great things to say!!"}
{"text":"Pizza lovers dream!!!  I've had a lot of pizza in my time and this is by far the best I have had. Everything on the menu is fantastic. Great customer service and the staff was great with my kids. I love supporting small local businesses and it's a must try. I will be returning for my pizza fix."}
{"text":"Awesome place....pizza is so good....staff very friendly...you all should try this place....Fresh Authentic ingredients. ..."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pickup lunch and had a great meatball sub and garlic knots. Very friendly service they really are there to serve you great food and you can tell it is not a fake attempt at good customer service."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza!!!  Traveling cross country with two kids who were hungry. Usually along interstate routes there aren't many choice places to eat.  My daughter found this place on yelp after searching for pizza. What she failed to mention was it was a bit away from the interstate.  After finally arriving and walking inside our noses went crazy with the yummy smells. We ordered a gluten free pizza which was perfect!  Left there happy and satisfied. The detour was worth it!"}
{"text":"The owners are always friendly, they remember you and what you like, and the food is terrific.  Best pizza in buckeye.  wings made to order and cooked to perfection.  Pasta dinners are huge, and include salad and bread for dine in."}
{"text":"Fa-nominal customer service! My family and I are always greeted at the hit of the door and thanked on our way out. This is a place that lives to pleasing their customers. Not only are the associates kind but the owner is super friendly. He's out there waiting on tables and taking orders and really just doing anything he can do to help his restaurant run smooth. Aside from amazing customer service the food is amazing! I just love their pizza and wing special!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the employees are always very friendly, best pizza place in Buckeye! I've been going here for 5 years now and never had any issues."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the best pizza I've ever tried. I had their stromboli and it was truly spectacular! My family is en route back to California and my mom wanted some pasta. She found this place and it was SO worth it. The staff was so kind and generous! Thank you so much for such a lovely experience! You all have a gift!"}
{"text":"For a growing place like buckeye we need a great pizza place and this is it! I read the reviews about the calzones so I decided to go try one. I got the calzone special and it was HUGE! I shared it with my husband and us together could not finish it. Very tasty. I'm excited to try the rest of the menu. The restaurant was very clean and inviting. The workers were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Anyone who lives near Buckeye HAS to try this place.  I strongly recommend the stromboli!  Great service and extremely friendly!  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Buckeye by far! Owners are usually always on site and very courteous."}
{"text":"They have excellent service. One of the friendliest pizza places in buckeye. The pizza might take a while but trust that the wait is worth it. The slices are huge and cheesy and will fill you up with 1. The wings are delicious as well, not as spicy as I'd like it to be but it's good enough. I'd highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"Very friendly team, delicious food, check out their Alfredo pasta - very rich and tasty."}
{"text":"I've lived in phoenix for 10+ years and I must say this is the best pizza and their wings are amazing.  I live on the opposite side of buckeye but will drive here anytime I want pizza."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life, pizza was cold not cooked all the way and there was hair in my food. Your better off ordering dominos than eating at this place. Never again."}
{"text":"We've gotten take-out twice now and each time was excellent. First experience was a pizza with white sauce, chicken and mushrooms..... Awesome! The other day we got lasagne that was really good too. So far, so good. The owner (I assume) that took the phone orders and handled the whole thing was very friendly and efficient as this place was pretty busy both times when I went in to pick up.  I feel that the price is very fair for what you receive... Quality and portion wise....good value. Gonna try another pie tonight, so I'm a return customer!"}
{"text":"Large qualities at an extremely low price. The pizza is slightly tasteless and the crust is crunchy and hard. However, the boneless chicken wings were great with the homemade ranch."}
{"text":"Clean, food was hot but not as good as Barro's Pizza. Employees were pleasant and the place was clean when we went in."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place in downtown Buckeye. Love supporting small business and this place hit the spot. Wings were AWESOME and so was the pizza. The pizza was a little greasy but the taste was delicious! Big slices, yummy ingredients and crispy thin crust. Will definitely be visiting again when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Pizza had good flavor but the dough was really rubbery it was like chewing steak would not ever go again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way from Phoenix to Yuma. Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid Calzones!!! Can't go wrong with this place. Always excellent service and always a great dinner! Thanks Jimmy for the best pizza in Buckeye!!!"}
{"text":"Go to pizza place but it got very old very quickly. We must've ordered from there so much we got tired of it. Or maybe it's because although they have over ten different pizzas, they somehow all taste the same. The menu is huge, which I find makes it hard to make everything on it very good. The larger the menu the more flavor and quality drop."}
{"text":"The pizza is always perfect NY style made by hand with fresh ingredients. The buffalo wings are excellent as well. One of our absolute favorite dishes is the chicken alfredo. Tommy makes it fresh with real cream! Everything is just wonderful no matter what you order. Prices are extremely reasonable and the service is excellent. We go there regularly and we enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"The pizza is great!  The toppings taste fresh and authentic. Friendly staff and a warm environment. You can also watch the game while you eat!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from here.  My children love the chicken strips ,the grilled chicken Caesar salad is amazing with the dressing, and the garlic bread with cheese it just as amazing, but  my order took an hour to be delivered. Other than that, I will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I decided to try something different (I love their buffalo chicken pizza and Stromboli's) today. My wife order an eggplant parm sub and I got ckicken parm. They were both delecious.  The bread may have been the best restaurant bread that I have ever had. This place has great Italian food.  The owner is very friendly and takes great pride in the quality of his menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Great ownership. Classic environment. Amazing crust."}
{"text":"Never even got to order. The manager argued with me about pricing that we were looking at online. Honestly, blew my mind that he argues with me about the prices that THEY advertised. Disappointed to say the least. Will never recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch when in buckeye ( not much options in buckeye) had the Philly cheese steak. sandwich was nothing special other than the price was in the double digits for it and a drink."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Buckeye hands down. My son and I love this place. When it's delivered it's hot and fresh. From the oven to my door."}
{"text":"I would say they are one of the best Pizza places in the West Valley. With so many of the chains using substitution ingredients, aka fake cheese ect ( I'm looking at you Papa Johns) this one stands out with their real sauce,cheese and dough."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything from the pizza to the people when we went here for the first time. The service was fabulous, the pizza was amazing, our food was fresh , and I had a family orientated atmosphere. The price was pretty decent as well .  We got to drink an extra large pizza 20 wings and  24 deep fried mushrooms.  And all that was under forty bucks. I really liked that the owner (I believe that was the owner) came out and was talking to us. And makes you feel comfortable when the owner or  the employees come out and talk to you. Asking  you how your food was and just talking to you. We would definitely go here again. I even told my husband and one to come here next weekend maybe for lunch and try one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got a pepperoni and garlic xtra large pizza and it was great! Just moved to the area and happy to say we have already found our go to pizza place. Wish they delivered to us but pickup was pretty much painless so will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have traveled all over the united states, eating a lot of pizza along the way. these guys can really make a pizza similar to a brick oven style. however I have never had a better Stromboli roll in my life then at Argentos. They have the mom and pop restaurant feel. I have gone there a few times now and the food and service have been great."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I love pizza, it is one of my favorite foods to eat and I grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., so I know a good pizza pie. I have been ordering from Argento's since they opened a few years ago and I have never been disappointed. The prices are more than fair and the taste is genuine. Reminds me of home.   I never write reviews online but decided that this was overdue after feeding some relatives that were visiting from Brooklyn tonight and hearing them rave about how good the pizza was. I have lived in Buckeye for almost 6 years and I have tried every pizza joint available in this area. Many have come and gone, and rightfully so. One of the main reasons I am writing a review for them is because I don't want to ever see them go so I want my neighbors to know they wont be disappointed.  Argento's is by far the best and I hope they stay for good.   If you are looking for a run-of-the-mill, cardboard, processed pizza, then order from one of the several national chains now available in Buckeye. But if you are looking for a delicious, real New York style pizza that will make your taste buds sing, make sure you give Argento's a try. You will bnot be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here. Definitely coming back! I highly recommend it to people who haven't gone. The pizza and wings are delicious and the owner makes you feel special. He greeted us and made us feel right at home."}
{"text":"Ordered a large sausage pizza and mild wings. Yum! We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Yum! I am in pain. But a GOOD pain! Food coma. The pizza, wings, salad, and garlic knots were bomb. The knots were freshly baked and ooooh man so good. My husband is a picky wing guy and he loves the hot wings.  The pizza is New York style and BOMB! I wish I could eat more but now I just want to sleep. The staff was friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Called and ordered pizza here for the first time the young lady on the phone was very nice. We got the meat lovers pizza, the Alfredo, and some hot wings. The pizza was great although the meat lovers was more my husbands choice next time I'll get half cheese or something because it was a tad too much meat for me but I am not as much of a meat lover. The Alfredo was delicious I opted for no meat since we got wings and meaty pizza. I could taste the butter and Parmesan in the sauce I loved it. The wings were good they had a good flavor we will be back !"}
{"text":"Finally found a good Italian restaurant that actually delivers in Buckeye. I've ordered from them 3 times last month. Food was great, pizza was perfect, everything delivered was HOT and on time. Pricing was a shade high but worth every penny. Will use them again maybe tonight."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way from Los Angeles to Tucson (it's not far from the Phoenix bypass). Great pizza. Friendly staff. They were very nice to our kids."}
{"text":"My niece recommended Argentos and said it was her favorite pizza and the best she's ever had.  And she is right!  The family atmosphere and friendly service made this experience even better.  Buckeye has a jewel so try Argentos when you're in town!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Customer service is top notch, right along with their food. The pasta is a family favorite."}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about- I'm wondering if that review wasn't written under a bogus ID that is a front for a competitor of Argentos. The fact that he reviewed three pizza places in one day, and then reviewed two others on the same day 34 days later seems fishy to me- who orders pizza from two or three places in the same day or even the same week? Anyway,  Believe me, if you've read my review of Landini's Pizza in San Diego, then you understand that \"I know from pizza\" as the saying goes in  NY.    Pizza is one of the trinity foods of the greater NYC area, the other two being bagels and authentic deli.  All three are frequently imitated but seldom duplicated accurately outside of a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.  I moved to AZ for a variety of reasons, and specifically to Buckeye in order to be in proximity to family plus for a great deal on a house.  Why else would I subject myself to the hinterlands of Maricopa County, the epicenter of AZ?  Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that in a sleepy town best known for farms and rodeo (as well as the only way to LA prior to the completion of I-10) a pizza man from NYC would decide to relocate his family and business. The owner, who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian (a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy) cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs, dinners, and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years.  There are no conveyor belt ovens, no round pizza grates or pans, just pumice lined pizza ovens fired up over five hundred degrees.   Relatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza, a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best. Not only could I recommend Argentos, but I encouraged them to order.  The Jerseyites were not disappointed, and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious. What better validation could a pizza shop get?"}
{"text":"Great food !!!   Have only had take out. Because my husband is a big tall man with knee trouble.  He cannot sit in these small booths comfortably. If they had a couple of tables and chairs it would be a go to favorite in Buckeye. It's close to where we live and we eat out with friends somewhere at least 4 times a week.  Great customer service and food. So we will continue to enjoy take out from time to time"}
{"text":"Great food! Superior family attitude !  Truly a wonderful dining experience.  We had a calzone (feeds 2-3 people) pasta (feeds 2-3 people) and a phenomenal pizza!  We will be back as often as possible. Oh and the cannoli is true NY it's to die for,  love this place!"}
{"text":"This place will never get old! It's the best salads in Buckeye. Add chicken to it and boom! Not to mention the meat is grilled and always bursting with flavor. Everyone is always nice. Our delivery guys are always on time and polite. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for a Margherita pizza and this seemed like a good place to try. We called for a tea out order.  We got the Sicilian version which was a good twist.  Could have had some more dollops of mozzarella on it.  Nice soft doughy crust.  Sauce was good.    Also go a meatball sandwich and French fries.  No salt was on the fries and the meatball, although not gross, were not the best.    The inside of the restaurant is old, tired, and outdated.  The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and gave me a water for the road on the house. There were 2 people eating when I was there, but uncertain if they worked there or were customers as they were speaking a foreign language with the man behind the counter that was not Italian.    Upon arriving at the restaurant it was odd.  A young man came out of the side door and appeared disoriented.  My wife did not go in with me but insisted on the windows up and doors locked when I went in.  She said later the way he was acting was unusual.  He walked to the corner.  Stared at the ground and literally walked around in circles.    As I exited the establishment he was coming back and stumbling.  He went back into the restaurant.  Not sure if this is a common occurrence or a random thing.  Just an observation.    Would call it a 2.5 experience but rounded up to 3 on this one.  The food ok.  Service ok.  Ambiance.....so so."}
{"text":"Love this place.. coming from the East Coast (NJ/NY), I know what real pizza should taste like.. Argento's NEVER disappoints.. the owner is there all the time and is super nice! Would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm so sad that I live so far from it. They have a wide variety of things on their menu. From appetizers. Salads. Sandwiches. Pizza. Calzones. Pastas! They also have bottled beer and a pretty large wine selection for those of you who enjoy a nice cold beer/glass with your lunch/dinner The food is amazing! Especially the Chicken Alfredo! So creamy full of flavor. Olive Garden who?! Great portions. Very surprised to see the amount of food that came all under $20. Came with a small salad and garlic bread. We also got the two slice pizza special with any toppings and a soda for lunch. The crust was so fresh! And the slices were huge! Hubby and I couldn't even touch the second slice after all the food that came with our order. The man at the front, is very knowledgable in his food and takes pride in his ingredients as he should! The food was so satisfying and if and when we are in the area again... We will definitely be back! Looking to try something new as EVERYTHING on the menu looked great! Thank you Argentos for the great hospitality and authentic delicious food! P.S. I got the small cannoli for dessert... YUUUUM! I wish I could fit another one but it was just the right finishing touch on one of the best lunches my husband and I have had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"This is the first time coming to this restaurant and I have to tell you it is great. My husband has been searing for a good Sromboli, but this place made a great one. Pizza also is delicious. We love thin crust pizza. They don't only have pizza and Sromboli they have a wide menu of appetizers and pastas and salads. And the service was great too. Tommy the owner came over and introduced himself to us. Very nice and respectful gentleman. We recommend this place to everyone. We loved it. Thank you Argentos you just gained yourself New family members. God bless you."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch while traveling through, thank you!  Good pizza, great service, clean and comfortable environment!"}
{"text":"Argénteos has great pizza and I come here often but forget about it when it gets busy , I waited 45 minutes to get my order to go ."}
{"text":"Argentos has speedy delivery and is never skimpy with their toppings. A solid pizza choice for where you are out in this neck of the woods. I particularity enjoy how their crust is firm, with a bit of softness. Their sausage was lean and there was tons of it. This isn't some mass produced sausage, this is the real deal. I hear the owners came from NY and brought their recipes with them. It shows! Great wings and fair prices make this a winner."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my lunch from Argento's. The portion was huge for the $14(included delivery). I had the baked ziti with Italian sausage, and I could tell the sausage was previously frozen because it was a little freezer burnt and texturally the outside was a little off. This was the only misstep in the whole meal. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was great. I'll most likely be ordering in again and include a follow up review."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The workers are really nice and the atmosphere is friendly. The restaurant was super clean.  Now, onto the food. The food is delicious! The appetizers were good portions and delicious. The mozarella sticks were so good. I can only describe it as having a tart fresh taste. I had the chicken parmigiana and I wish I could have eaten it all! I can't wait to visit our friends again just to come here! I wish we had this place back in California!"}
{"text":"Our go-to pizza place! Recently tried the margherita and it was really different and tasty. Love their fried zucchini too. The owner is so funny and friendly too! Great small town feel."}
{"text":"Best food best service. Everything is always fresh and is super authentic. The owner is the nicest guy and is always in a great mood. I often add ingredients like sausage to some of his plates and he never complains about it. The salad dressing is amazing."}
{"text":"Tommy is a great guy and he makes amazing food. End of story. Try it. He really puts his heart into this and makes everything himself. This is as local as it gets. This place will make you come for more. You will like it."}
{"text":"Okay I'm going to be specific here. Not to complain but because I like this place and spend a lot of money eatting here and they deliver. Hopefully they will take note. First off, pizza is great, wouldn't change a thing. And it's huge! Lots of cheese and thin, I like. Also, you can reheat the pizza and it taste good the next day too. Now, what I don't like. When you order the meal they don't give you the salad. That to me is bad business on take out. You pay the same price but they don't have to clean up after you or wait on you so you should get the full meal. 2nd thing is when they bring you the meal with the bread, no butter. Really, who wants to eat bread without butter? Their Stomboli's are to die for! Some inconsistancy's though. I found now I order and have to say make sure there's plenty of cheese... They could also be a little less salty. You reheat them and the salt really stands out. The Zitto on the other hand could use a little garlic salt but it's good as well. My favorit is fetticini. That being said, I couldn't eat theirs and I threw it away. Their chicken wings are very tasty but way too small. They must have a special place they buy them from, miniture chicken ranch! They are inconsitant as well. Some have come really over cooked. All in all the staff is great so is the delivery."}
{"text":"I've been to Argento's twice - nothing personal against them, I just don't go much for pizza. Their calzones are huge and the pie is very tasty and, AFAIK, authentic (absolutely nothing compares to a slice hot off the cart in Manhattan). Their two-slices-and-a-Coke lunch deal looks like a winner. Prices are reasonable and service is fast and accurate."}
{"text":"I actually created a Yelp account just so I can leave a review on this place.  We tried it for the first time about 2 weeks ago and already went back last night. We have tried the pizza and it was really good.  It's a bit greasy, but I have yet to find a pepperoni pizza that isn't.  The boneless wings are delicious.  My mother in law tried the steak and cheese calzone and it was pretty big and basted in garlic butter. This is now our go to pizza spot in Buckeye."}
{"text":"Food was hot, fresh, good and inexpensive.  Staff was polite and helpful. Kitchen looks clean."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. The employee or owners are so kind. They were offering everyone bottled water while they waited for to go orders. The pizza is priced right. It's tasty. The crust, cheese and sauce is all perfect portions. It is delicious. I will now be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 10 times in the last 6 months......it just doesn't get any better!    From Pizza to salads.....it's all fantastic.  My favorite is the Stromboli and the Anti pasta salad......oh, and they make the best Italian dressing.....like non other.  One time I did have a problem (due to the cashier) with the order not being made.....but the guys took ownership of the situation and fixed it FAST!  They were sincerely sorry for the miscommunication and so very apologetic.  Mistakes happen......but all it takes is someone to own up to it and make it right......and that they did!  Still my favorite place to go for pizza and subs.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The best pizza ever I've ever tasted I come from New York I come from the Bronx 80s exactly exactly like pizza from back home it is so good is delicious it's me there's no way so explain the pizza and they're very nice people they welcome you win their price is out rages cheap for pizza I love him very like I said before very good very tasty very delicious and I gave him 50,000 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pizza and wings are soo good! Staff is always friendly and helpful. You can tell they work hard. Wish there were more locations, but it's worth the drive to me."}
{"text":"Greasy pizza, rude owners ...now I see that they made the Channel 5 News \"Dirty Dining\" show with 5 major health code violations... Yikes doesn't surprise me"}
{"text":"I've been going to Argento's for quite a few years. Since it's been open actually and we have loved the pizza there. My husband is the biggest fan and he would eat there everyday if he could. It's delicious and you get a lot of food for not a lot of money, but doesn't lack in taste."}
{"text":"Tried take out and loved it! Will be back. Argentos special, it was great! The crust did get a little dry but the pizza itself was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I always get delivery and they're great at making sure everything is correct.  Love the white pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I don't know what \"Jerry Q\" has been eating or who he has been talking to, but this place is the best around! The owner is always friendly and the food is excellent. I have had the privilege of dining on Manhattan pizza several times and this is as close as it gets out here! This is definitely a paralell to the other pizza place I reviewed in Goodyear. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to buckeye from California and all I can say is awesome pie and service!!! A must try if you live local"}
{"text":"We just moved to area, and we're looking for a good pizza place.  Many people said, try this place.  That it definately would not disappoint. We ordered delivery.  Food came pretty quick and still warm. Nice employees who took our order and who made delivery. This place is cool. The pizza, the pasta ...Really like it."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Buckeye, and the nicest people. We love the Philly Cheese steak subs too."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I've tried it a couple times now and the service has always been great and the prices are really fair. You get a ton of food for what you pay for! The wings are great and the garlic knots are nice and garlicky. The pizza is thin crust and has been pretty greasy each time, but that can be expected with homemade-style pizza. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! True Italian pizza. The 18 in double sliced feeds my family of five."}
{"text":"A great Buckeye establishment: excellent pizza, pasta, and sandwiches. It's a bit pricey, but the owner is super nice and they have some great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Not much to say aside from amazing pizza, salads, and boneless wings. The staff is friendly and the two individuals whom I assume are the owners because they are always there, are great and always very polite.   Not much to say when a place makes what they make so right."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza in the past and thought it was terrible. So yesterday I decided to try their Stromboli. What a mistake! Small, greasy, and hardly any filling, the absolute worst Stromboli I've ever had! To top it off, today I can't wander too far from the bathroom! Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I really need to stop using Yelp and trusting that their rating system is an accurate representation of good and bad.  Once again, I was fooled into believing that I was about to eat some of the best pizza I have ever had.  Sadly, it was all a lie.  Their first offense was putting mushrooms on my pizza.  There appears to be an issue when you view their website through the Yelp app.  If you use a laptop or desktop, you are presented with their updated 2017 website that shows a different menu.  When I attempted to view their website using my phone, it shows an older menu from 2015.  The obvious discrepancy is that the 2015 pizza I ordered didn't come with mushrooms.  So, that pissed me off, but perhaps Argentos is not at fault.  However, if I were them I would contact Yelp and have them look into this.  Their second offense was making a pizza that was practically inedible that cost me over $21.00.  I don't know if it was the quality of ingredients or cooking process, but it wasn't good and I don't know why people think it is.  I have had very good pizza and very bad pizza and this ranks toward the bottom with Dominoes and Papa John's.   It's unfortunate, because the service is great and the people are very nice and accommodating.  I was even offered a free slice of pizza or something because of my bad experience, but I won't be returning to take advantage of their offer.  The first impression is incredibly important and when a restaurant fails to impress I cross them off my list.  With that being said, Argentos is locally owned so if you want to take a risk at having a bad experience, be my guest."}
{"text":"This had little gem is a great place to get anything from pizza to pasta. They even deliver and are usually pretty quick about it. Every time I have ordered from here the food has always been really great and the staff is super friendly. This is a great place to grab a family meal"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. I'm not a huge fm fan of the pizza and wings solely because it's so greasy to me. I love their Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and the Antipasta salad though! They deliver within a 5 mile radius and that's something that I love. It doesn't take too long to deliver. I've had them tell me that it would be between 35-45 minutes and have arrived within 20. I would recommend this place!  10/8/16 update- I recently ordered from this place using the delivery service through Yelp. The service so far has been TERRIBLE! I've currently been waiting on my order of Large Antipasta and Oven baked Baked Ziti for 1 hour and 20 minutes while the email sent to me estimated the delivery to be fulfilled within 45-60 minutes. I called Argento's to check on my order after 1 hour and 10 minutes and a guy in the background said that \"He just left with that order\" and that it should be here \"any minute\". I seriously live down the street and around the corner which is about a 1-2 minute drive and now 20 MINUTES after call I'm STILL WAITING on my food! TERRIBLE ARGENTO'S! I'm so disappointed in you!"}
{"text":"Argentos definitely has the best pizza in valley. I've had pizza all over the world and this place has truly made an impression on me. I  ordered vegetable pizza and wings, the pizza was so fresh and vibrant blending all the delicious flavors, and the wings had an amazing tang and the sauce was out of this world. I recommend this place to everyone especially to all California travelers going in and out of Phoenix to stop by Argentos Pizza as it really will be worth your time...The people are friendly and the place is so clean. I'd give this place 10 Stars!"}
{"text":"Finally a calzone to make me stop missing Chicago! Bathed in fresh garlic butter- your senses start to enjoy it before it even hits your table. The pizza is standard fair but better than most in the west valley. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza, stromboli and pasta!  My daughter and I had the traditional stromboli which was generously portioned, was filled with delicious meats, phenomenal mix of cheeses and amazing sauce and encased in the most perfectly crispy on the outside soft and the inside dough!  My wife had the ziti:  perfectly textured pasta and sauce made with grape tomatoes that beats any sauce I've ever tasted.   My son had two slices of pizza - one pepporoni and the other, per the recommendation of our server there special buffalo chicken topped with in house made ranch which is now probably my favorite pizza of all time.  If I lived there, I'd be a regular.  We were passing through on I-10 travelling from Texas back to California.  It's well worth the short drive in from the freeway - don't pass this absolutely fantastic restaurant up!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza to go. The pizza was quite good. Crust was not too thin and not too thick, it was crispy enough. The ingredients tasted fresh especially the cheese. Family really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have no idea what Barry G is talking about..I checked and Channel 5 has no such violations on any show for this establishment. Check his reviews and you be the judge..competitor or just permanently dissatisfied? I went there tonight. The owner was there and as previously said by others, he is very friendly , nice and customer oriented. I was waited on promptly and ordered a meat lovers pizza. While I was waiting the owner went to the cooler chest and brought me a FREE bottle of water...who offers you that in the valley?? The pizza was delicious..loaded with quality meat and cheese. Crust is freshly made and hand tossed, a true NY pizza at its best! VERY reasonable price and you can add some great wings for a few bucks more. An XLG  1 topping pizza and 25 wings for $22.00..hands down the best bang for your buck in the valley. Great for a family meal on a Friday night AND offers 10% Military, Police, Fire and Senior DISCOUNT!! I guarantee you'll be back for more, I know I will, its a keeper!"}
{"text":"After searching for a place to eat for 2 hours, my friend and I came across Argentos here on Yelp. Im fairly new to Buckeye so I am not fully sure what is around me. Being a native New Yorker I generally stay away from all pizza out here because it just truly is not the same.  As I scrolled through the pictures of food I decided that I needed to give this place a shot. Boy oh boy am I glad I did! Of course I had to order a bunch of food to make sure that if I didn't like something I would have more options to eat. I loved every single bite! The pizza is amazing! Sold by the slice or by the pie which is a wonderful familiar feel for me. The Stromboli and Calzone were cooked to perfection! The dough is so perfect I can't even describe it! They were so nice to us they even gave us two cannoli's on the house!  I will most definitely be returning for their amazing food!"}
{"text":"We never came here before, but followed Tommy here when he left Taste Of Italy. Now this is our \"go to\" place for NY style hand tossed pizza and wings.   The pizza is very good, the chicken wings best in the valley. We order them \"crispy\", and they knock it out of the park.   Their dinner salads are plentiful, fresh, and a great value.   Calzones are the best we've ever had. Crunchy golden brown crust, packed full of traditional fixings. They never skimp, always more than I can eat, and that's saying a lot.   Pasta dishes are abundant, tasty, and always steaming to the table.   Staff is okay, could use some stability and smiles. But Tommy understands both how to run a kitchen and how to connect with customers. I'm sure he'll figure out the counter help."}
{"text":"This is not your typical pizza & wings joint.  The food coming out of that kitchen is so much better than you'd expect in such a cute little neighborhood restaurant.  This is excellent food prepared fresh to order.  You might have to drive a bit to get there, but it is well worth the extra miles.  Take MC85 and enjoy the beautiful views.   We ordered the baked lasagna (cheesy, tasty goodness) and a calzone (enormous and delicious) plus a couple of side salads.  The green salad with sliced tomato, black olives, and shredded carrot was fine when you added the offered Italian style dressing.  We thoroughly enjoyed the basket of little garlic knots and the cannoli.  They have all the usual soft drinks and a nice selection of bottled beers.  We are definitely going back.    All in, we spent under $25.  So, excellent food and a knockout price."}
{"text":"The pizza, salad, and dessert was a great value. We had the thick crust meat lovers pizza. It had a great sauce and a lot of meat while not being overloaded with cheese. The presentation on the salad was awesome.  There was so much food, we are looking forward to what we brought home."}
{"text":"Beast pizza in town. It's fast and fresh. You can watch them make your pizza right over the counter. I get the calzones with every pizza. The wings are good size too. Twice as large as any other pizza place around here."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Buckeye. Their eggplant supreme pizza with added ricotta is excellent"}
{"text":"Best pizza around this area by far. Excellent food for a good price. The service is always great as well."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Best Pizza I have found in the west.  My husband and and I are from queens, and only here on a short term basis for work, so we are always on the search for what we call \"Real food\".  This place fits the bill.  The guy who runs it and makes the Pizza is from Staten Island, and understands how to make a pizza correctly.  The crust is very crunchy and the sauce is just a little sweet.  This is a NY pizza.  Best way you can tell with out even trying a slice, ask them how they make their White Pizza.  If they have no idea what you are talking about, no NY, if they put extra crap, not NY.  This place, they do it perfectly.  Eat here, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great Timing on there Food. Also On Delivery service are on time. Rate from 1 to 100.  I Rate it 110!!!! Love Tommy's Lil Elevs Helpers."}
{"text":"For a pizza shop in Buckeye AZ this is by far the best I've had. Very comparable to Rays in Phoenix and I would certainly come here and eat again. Prices are reasonable, a 16\" cheese will set you back about $12. Garlic knots are pretty solid, as is the antipasta salad.   Lots of large and small booths in the building for groups of all sizes, clean outside and in.   If you've got a pizza craving here in Buckeye, go here and skip the chain places. You'll thank yourself!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place ever!!!! The owners always treat you like family and will even cook dishes not on the menu on request. The crust is perfect and very tasty. The ingredients are all fresh as is the dough. The portions are huge! You will not leave hungry and the prices are very reasonable. The place is very comfortable and will accommodate big parties on short notice."}
{"text":"Great food and broad selection of things besides pizza on the menu.  But the pizza is really good, freshly made dough and a good amount of toppings.  fast and friendly service, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday night around 8pm. We ordered a medium cheese pizza. The crust was thin and chewy. The sauce was a bland marinara. The cheese was your basic pizza shop quality. The dinner salad was good quality lettuce with fresh veggies. My sister had the baked lasagna. It was definately the low point. It was flavorless, salty, watery, and very undesirable. The interior is clean but lacks any character. We will not be retuning."}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey and this is the closest you will get to Jersey Pizza. The owner is from NJ. It's a far drive, but if you're ever on that side of town or you crave New Jersey pizza this is the place. They have slices they're huge their pizzas are big and delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery food came fast and was real hot. It was my 1st time eating here. The Alfredo was good but had a lot a garlic. The pizza is by far the best pizza I have had in the valley. It is a little expensive but is still worth every penny"}
{"text":"We stopped by Argento's with friends after spending the afternoon at the Hellzapoppin PRCA rodeo. Our friends had been prepping us all day describing the outstanding pizza they'd enjoyed at Argento's. They were absolutely right on! Our party of six enjoyed excellent pizza with terrific service and value prices. Fresh ingredients were obvious. The crust was perfect and the sauce exceptional. Lots of other treats on the menu too. Argento's is about 20 miles from our home but well worth the easy drive."}
{"text":"THE best Italian food in Arizona! I come from Boston, so I know pizza. Tommy makes the best pizza I have ever had! Good food, friendly atmosphere, outstanding service and reasonable prices; just a great place to take the family. Try everything, it's all excellent!"}
