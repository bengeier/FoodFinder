{"text":"Worst hookah ever! Because of the services, they don't care at all. They don't ask you about the hookah, is it good or bad? Which means they're bad af. I threw up because of their awful hookah."}
{"text":"Decided to make a visit here during a 5 hour layover in Phoenix. One quick taxi ride from PHX and my hookah was ready to go. Very comfortable atmosphere, great ambiance, fantastic service, hookah flavors totally on point. These guys know what they're doing. I'm from LA where hookah lounges are a dime a dozen, this was an awesome find. Def give them a go."}
{"text":"The service is 10 out of 10 .. The manager is always in the cafe and make sure his regulars get what they need exactly! The vibe of the place is perfect for groups. And I can confidently say it is one of the top hookah bars \"Shisha\" wise. Prices are also good compared to other hookah lounges."}
{"text":"I have been going to Memo's for years now as a regular everyday. People always ask me why I go there all the time when I can go some place else. I'll explain because I know the cafe better than the people who only went a few times and decided to bash on the cafe and it's owners. This may seem long, but I promise very informative! :)

 The owners and the workers there will protect any female who walks in that door. If a female feels uncomfortable about anything, they will fix it instantly and I have seen it happen before. I also go there because I get treated very well. I get my hookah and coals on time. I don't have to wait twenty minutes for coals like some other places. I also go there because my hookah will last me for a long time. 

Also, as a student, the environment during the week is very calm and quiet. It is an amazing place for me to study. The tables are perfect desks and the chairs are comfortable so my back doesn't hurt. People will complain about the pricing, which is bogus. There is a beautiful pink sign by the register that says \"Tax and Tip included.\" How much more obvious does it get? That's another great thing about Memo's cafe. They won't let their employees work all night for a few dollars in tips. No matter what anyone says, we all know it is not fair. 

I used to go to other hookah bars, and being better than the people who decided to leave nasty comments, I didn't do that. But I can come up with an enormous amount of reasons why I choose Memo's Cafe over any other hookah bar.

With that being said, if you are looking for a place to be comfortable at, smoke great hookah, study during the week, party during the weekend, sing karaoke, play cards, or even to just sit alone, Memo's Cafe is the spot for any type of customer."}
{"text":"Memos is the most spacious and cleanest hookah place I have been to. Their flavor choices are broad and atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of flavors and the place has a great atmosphere. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because of the last time we visited memos on Saturday, the employee who made us the hookah was not very friendly and the hookah was under average. Lydia is my favorite server of all time, she's very fun to talk too and is always refreshing our coals. We revisited today and the service was amazing and our hookah was phenomenal, we asked the hookah guy to make us anything fruity and it tasted amazing ! Will be returning !"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time on Friday, it had a good rating on here, so decided to check it out. All the servers were super nice, checked on us and we also met the one owner who took care of us. Now we went back yesterday night, and it was not the same... Our hookah was not on point, the other owner who seemed younger told us it wasn't their fault the hookah tasted bad, no flavor.. Just smoke. Four things I don't like about this hookah bar.  
 1: We checked it out first of all because of the basic hookah was $10.99, we didn't know there was extra fees so it added to be more..

2: You have to buy a drink per person you have with you. Or they charge you a $2.00 cover per person.

3: They charge a 10% gratitude on every bill. 

4: When you do get a drink, they bring a cup with ice on top of your bottled drink.. Looked at the bill and they charge $0.50 for a CUP OF ICE?! 

Not really worth the price, but the one owner was super nice."}
{"text":"I love coming here, people are so friendly and the hookah is great! My favorite is the NyQuil... Their house mix. I loved it so much I bought my hookah and kept it here because I study here while I smoke hookah. Along with drinks, tea, soda, water, soft drinks etc; they also have goodies to munch on :) free wifi, and weekends they have belly dancers too. Make new friends in this comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"This Hooka bar is hidden in a ghetto shopping center behind a Burger King.

The staff is not very inviting and seems agitated by having to help customers initially. Once you have ordered and just need your coals tweaked, there seems to be a shift to more pleasant service. 

The environment is comfortable. If you go early, they will usually be watching a movie on the several screens. Later in the day/evening the place switches to pop music that is not too too loud, so it is still possible to talk with your friends sitting around you. 

The Hooka itself is fine. I'm no connoisseur of Hooka but is seems good enough."}
{"text":"The best hookah lounge in Tempe!!! I like the owner he is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Location is great as well. But the hookah is amazing!!!! When my friends and family come in from out of town I take them to this hookah lounge. Great place and great smoke"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with JK from the first time I went to Memo's it felt like home. The service is amazing the are constantly making sure your hookah is hot. Their are arab guys there but then again it is a Hookah lounge so if you don't want to see arab guys why don't you go somewhere that doesn't have so much to do with the arab culture. All the guys I have ever met there have been respectful and nice. The best part about Memo's Cafe is Memo!!! He is so fun and interacts with all the customers. The FLAVORS are the main reason I go try his special blends they are amazing. I love the themed nights he has there is belly dance nights, Sunday is movie night where he plays movies on a big screen and now he has belly dance lessons I LOVE THIS place. Best Hookah in town."}
{"text":"So, when I tried to check in here last night, I found that the other Memo's Cafe on Yelp is located on the wrong place on the map and was unable to.  Therefore I am being forced to relocate my review to make it geographically accurate!  I am going to update it as well:

Memo's has quickly become my only hookah spot.  Between the excellent Shisha, the attentive coal-changing, and the varying atmospheres depending on the evening, I would highly recommend Memo to take care of any of your hookah needs.

The best night that I've been to so far is definitely Tuesday, Kareoke night.  There was literally an entire dance floor getting down, and to see such a sight without the addition of alcohol is definitely nuts!  The Kareaoke was actually really good, although there's no way I'd have the guts to get up there myself without a few Cue Club long islands.

I generally go for Memo's blend for Shisha, but there is a wide selection and they use Al Fakher, which is my favorite brand as well.

There is a drink minimum, but water counts and is only two bucks.

Overall, definitely the best place I've been at - great atmosphere, and it's been getting packed recently which makes you feel like you're out, even without a hangover in the morning!"}
{"text":"I would consider myself pretty traveled in the land of hookah lounges and I liked this place

+the layout is good. you can either sit at a table to play some cards or whatever OR you can sit in one of the couch-booth areas.
+the staff is great.  Always attentive and willing to answer questions about the shisha 
+if you want to have a solo night this place is a good spot since no one will bug you and you can peacefully hang out and smoke by yourself

The only thing I didn't like from a few times I went was that they weren't playing middle eastern music.  I know some people complain about that music, but are you serious?  That's part of the culture, if you don't like it, don't go to a middle eastern spot.  That would be like eating at a taqueria and getting annoyed that they're playing latin music."}
{"text":"This was a nice hookah lounge and the food was great. The customer service was really nice as well especially for my friend who had no idea what hookah was. Me and my friends had a good time here. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I love it. The flavors are great and the service is awesome! I usually order the flavor NyQuil which is minty and a little fruity."}
{"text":"Memos is the best spot for smoking hookah by far ! The hookah there is amazing they are rite when they say u tried the rest now try the best ! The service is amazing and the staff is friendly and always there asking customers if try are good always giving coals. The place is clean and relaxing. Also the prices are the cheapest than any other hookah bar in town they care about the customers always no matter what ! If your in the mood to relax and enjoy an amazing hookah go to memos an trust me u will never go anywhere else !"}
{"text":"Our first time in a hookah lounge so I do not know what to expect. I can say Aziz was very friendly and kind in explaining how to it all works. He made a mint and bubble gum mix that was very good."}
{"text":"Best hookah in AZ which is why I have been coming here for years. Workers are always friendly. If there is ever a problem with a hookah they always fix it. Plus they are great with giving suggestions for customers who don't know what flavor they want"}
{"text":"Horrible place. The place always makes you feel sleepy. And you cannot be social because the music is so loud that you can only talk to the person next to you. And that's still by yelling in their ear.  

The hookah is good, not amazing, but good. But the reason I hate this place is because they always overcharge you. 

Do me a favor and ask for the receipt instead of just paying. 

There are hidden charges like icing your hookah and other stuff which they automatically charge you for even though you never asked for it. EVERY SINGLE TIME. 

When they have a DJ and dancing on Friday night or something, it could be fun. But they still overcharge you without telling you. And they add a tip automatically etc etc.

Just ask for the receipt when you pay and you will see."}
{"text":"I loved this hookah lounge. I went with my boyfriend, who has smoked hookah before (it was my first time personally). Great place for those who are just starting out on hookah. We got the mint + double apple. They even provided ice in it (says on the menu it's 50 cents extra; I think that's just if you want more later on maybe?). Well prepared, great environment, not very loud and obnoxious. Was filled with older-generation people as well so not very rowdy. Nice dim lights, arabic house music playing later on in the night."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hookah bar in Tempe for the young crowd. There Hookahs are one of the best in the area and atmosphere is not too quite or too loud, but just right. They play a variety of music including Arabic, Hip hop and rock. Some days more than others, depending on the mood and atmosphere. On weekends, they have lots of people, but is still not too crowded. If you wanna smoke good hookah, and enjoy your night, Memo's is the place to be."}
{"text":"After going serval weeks in a row to watch Sunday, Monday, and Thursday night football they have nothing worth going back for. The staff was quite and a little slow. They have a few customers who they personally know and are there almost every time I went. Thoes individuals were rude all together. Had a hookah bowl that sucked straight through the hose and they did nothing for the price and some how it came out to be more than the normal price??? So I would not recommended this lounge. I'm definitely not going back! Good luck guys."}
{"text":"Memo's is awesome, every time I go I have so much fun. The flavors of hookah that they have are unmatched anywhere.  Their seating area could be a little bit more comfortable. But other than that this place is perfect."}
{"text":"I went to the opening night this past friday night.  This place was ok.  They had some good eastern music, but for the most part, the DJ just played Top 40 radio hits and played them way too loud.  GROSS!  However, they do have a wide selection of Hookah tobacco, and the setup of the place was nice. I'd say check it out, see what you think.  The music might be better on other nights."}
