{"text":"Fresh made breakfast food ready to order!!!   Fruity pebble French toast was crazy good!!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice should be served by the gallon it is that good!  Everyone is friendly and service is fast and awesome.  Chris took the time to chat with us about all the tasty specials too.  Run as fast as you can here for breakfast and lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"Found a new breakfast place. Food was great and was delivered in my office 15 minutes after I ordered it. Beach Cafe has taken up to 90 minutes to deliver."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars, I would. The restaurant is poorly staffed and the people working are disorganized. The food is over priced and below average. I ordered their special, which was a California BLT. It was bland and it was not very filling and it cost me $10. I regret ever ordering food from there."}
{"text":"Coming from Columbus Ohio we found this and had an awesome coffee and breakfast before our flight out.  The breakfast burrito was great ! Good place and people."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We customized our own burgers and sandwiches. The fries and cucumber salad were great sides. There wasn't any food left on the table when we were done. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Having my car serviced at Sin City BMW and it is lunch time! Oh my...where to eat in an industrial park....yelp to the rescue! It is walking distance from Sin City and what a hidden little gem. Patty Melt -perfection. Nice staff, clean with cute decor. I will make this my stop whenever having car serviced!"}
{"text":"first time ordering here it used to be sunset grill, and so far so great!  i ordered a omelette which was soo good. i definitely recommend getting some orange juice!  the cookies are also really good and soft. everything was neatly packaged . look forward to eating from here soon!!!"}
{"text":"I work accross the street from Fork & Burger, and was initially a little nervous to give them a shot because of a few less than stellar experiences with their predecessor in the spot. I ended up giving them a chance after they were open for a few days and have been back probably ten times now in their first few weeks of business. Their omelettes have become a morning staple when I'm starting work, and for lunch I'll take their spinach and walnut salad with balsamic over anything up the street at skinny fats. They got my initial business based on proximity, but have earned my return visits with great food and awesome service. These guys care about their food and their customers and it really shows, give them a shot."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! Tried the taco breakfast and it was delicious! The potatoes were great too!!! Gotta come back and try their lunch menu- looks good!!!"}
{"text":"It would get no stars if possible, I went here for lunch ordered a burger with fries after 15 mins had to ask for my drink at 25 mins I ask about my food they said it was come out, when it came out in a to go box when I order it for there, it came out incorrect I cut in to it with a fork and it was raw when I ask for my money back I paid $11 and change they only refund me $10.00 I would avoid this place the service and food are terrible. Skinny fats is less than a mile away and the have great food"}
{"text":"Found this place after seeing another Yelp review. Little tricky to find but so well worth the ride. This is a hidden gem. Place is pretty much locals and boy do they have a good secret. Service was excellent and menu was great for breakfast or lunch. The chicken cheesesteak special was amazing and the burger and fries were also very good. Had a nice conversation with the owner Chris. If you like to support local businesses this is the place for you! Must stop on your next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with 5 friends.  Great location to meet friends coming from all different parts of town AND off-Strip.  Good food, big burgers and quick service.  They close early (2:30) so once the lunch rush is over, they're out!    All in all...worth it and a good place for locals to know about."}
{"text":"We flew in from Austin tx for the Zion half- choose to eat here. The service and food was awesome!! Clean and very cute place- they have fresh squeezed OJ!"}
{"text":"I got egg and avo it's really healthy for my taste but it's really good I recommend their Philly cheese steak beef is good and tender and people are friendly good service. Overall good place to have quick burger it's hidden in an industrial area."}
{"text":"To Dave G: Amazing, tasty food takes time. Lots of love and thoughts are put in to it. Good food is always worth the wait for me. If you need fast, greasy, pre-made, freezer burnt food, I suggest you go to Carl's Jr or McDonalds. To mention a competitor's name in your post just tells me that you either work for the competitor or you have no taste buds :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! A bit hard to find but its worth the effort.   The staff is very helpful and accommodating. We had a great experience. Thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"Once again fantastic experience.  Nathan at the counter is spot on with his customer service and hus smile will make you melt. Great all American food selections and comfort food."}
{"text":"Fresh/Great Menu/ nice place for a quick workday lunch.  They specialize in burgers but I'm a fan of the watermelon salad and chicken tacos.   Only complaint- Pepsi no Coke."}
{"text":"Great concept and wow what an amazing burger.  It's worth the visit.  The burger was amazing, fries freshly cooked out of the fryer and hot.  Cucumber salad was very tasty and the staff was amazing.  Wish I could franchise this concept and bring to California."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Jumped on yelp as soon as we landed in Las Vegas. Close to airport with good reviews. We both had the BLT with fries and it was tasty. Staff was very nice and the dining area was very clean. Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because is was deprived of burgers over the holidays.  Saw the mixed reviews and the are all correct.  Good and bad.  There wasn't a line at 11:30, yet our food took about 10 minutes to come out.  While we were eating, there had to be a constant line of 6-8 people the whole time.  Moves a little slow for the number of tables. (These could also have all been called in  take-out orders -I didn't notice) The burger was better than typical fast food, would have benefited from some mayo, but cooked well, fresh lettuce and tomato.  The fries were great.  Thick crinkle cut and crisp. I wouldn't drive across town to go here, but if you're in the neighborhood, not a bad choice. I'll be back to try them again."}
{"text":"Small burger with big price, they don't even toast the buns. Driven past Fork and Burger many times and wanted to try it. Today I did to my disappointment. I ate the burger in 4 bites paid 11.00 for a cheese burger fries and a Pepsi. Last time coming here, save your money thousands of other places with better burgers that are bigger and much less expensive."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of the Yelp ratings. We were disappointed. The food was mediocre. The food is not worth the hype. I suspect the reviews are paid reviews."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Excellent service. Best food I have ever eaten. Must try. Hint: Try this instead of Shake Shak. Free WiFi? Ask  Jalal"}
{"text":"Happy to find this hidden gem near my office. great food and best of all, fast delivery."}
{"text":"Very solid place  Burgers are very good and the BLT is Delish. It is in a weird area for food but the place inside is clean and welcoming. They have a good fried chicken sandwich also. Nice little spot in a industrial kind of area. Staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good first time, second time 45 minuets no food, lots of unhappy folks looking at time, then random food to random tables, staff seems lost in where food goes, it was hard to get a refund. Great way to spend lunch break The one and only staff member was very nice however over loaded."}
{"text":"Holy Fork!  Fork those other burger places and come here.  Fork and Burger is a hidden little place in the middle of a business park.  They serve breakfast and lunch to the lucky ones who find it. It's quaint dining area is kept clean for their patrons. Service from the gentleman working the front was friendly and so helpful.  His genuine smile is a sure warm welcome.  I walked in for a lunch treat.  Treat indeed.  They posted their burger of the month on the wall and it definitely caught my eye.  The Resolution Buster Burger.  Im intrigued!  2 Angus beef patties, 2 slices cheese, 4 slices of bacon and LTO.  If you're rubbing you eyes to see if you read that right, you did!  FOUR slices of bacon.  The thick pieces of bacon topped the juicy burger like a cherry on top.  Delicious.    I have to mention the mound of sweet potato fries served on the side of my giant sandwich.  My eyes grew a little bigger as I ogled this lovely side.  They were perfect and crisp.    I love local businesses that deliver quantity with quality.  Yep I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not in this area very often so I relied on yelp. I actually typed in pizza and this place came up. If you have over 4 stars and you serve pizza it's good. I got there and there was no pizza. No problem. I ordered chicken tenders. 15 minute wait. Ok I can handle that if these are 4.5 star chicken fingers. 9 bucks for fingers and fries with no drink. I'm still ok. The problem was that these were 2 star fingers, and the French fries were 3 star fries. Honey mustard tasted funny. I threw most of it away, and that's saying a lot. I was hungry. Maybe chicken fingers aren't their thing. If that's the case I say remove it from the menu."}
{"text":"Consistently underwhelmed the past few times I've been here.  Today,  the fries were crinkle cut when I'd asked for sweet potato. Then when corrected, they were RAW and barely warm. The special burger, with the aforementioned fries and a drink, ended up costing $17.40. It had better be giving a happy ending at that price.   And packaged in detestable stryrofoam. :(   I think I'll go to 5 Guys from now on."}
{"text":"Love these guys.. right across the street from my job so walking distance.. quick, awesome service. Nathaniel greats ya when you come in the door, but still provides that one on one customer service when you're placing your order. He's friendly even under the busy lunch pressure.   The food is good great for a quick lunch spot. French dip and the Grilled chicken sandwich (yum) are my favorite... They use to have amazing honey butter biscuits- my diet thanks then for getting rid of them. But my sweet tooth does not. Ha!   Overall great place- great people and great food!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner and the skillet was delicious. They were very accommodating with lots of modifications we had to make and patient with our kids who spread salt everywhere.   Pancakes were delicious and right now they're testing a new Churro pancake with cinnamon.   It's hard to find, in an industrial park at the very end and back one building from the street, but worth the search. It's only one mile from the strip."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Amazing breakfast options.  The skillets are fresh and tasty.  Sandwiches are made to order.  Overall 5 starts because the service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Driving through Vegas on our way to Brian Head, we were looking for a lunch place that wasn't typical fast food (e.g. Taco Bell or In-and-Out) but we needed quick and inexpensive. This place was great. Everyone in our party, including kids and adults were happy with our meals. The staff was super nice and the patrons were friendly, too. He place was clean and parking was plentiful. Easy peazy. We'd definitely stop here again and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It was good but not as good as we thought it was going to be. I really liked the turkey burger, my sweet potato fries we under cooked so they were harder then I like. Their F&B sauce is really good! My husband didn't loves his burger or fries that's why I gave it a three star."}
{"text":"Heard this place was opening today close to my work and wanted to try it out. They definitely had some opening pains with kitchen equipment and machines but the customer service was superb!! The food was awesome too. Highly recommend the chicken fingers and try all of their dipping sauces. If that's not on the mind then go for the egg salad sandwich. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Finally talked my boyfriend into trying this place..And I gotta say I'm glad I did. It's a nice little hidden gem. Service was good, and food was even better. I got the sloppy jack which I loved. And my boyfriend got the mushroom & Swiss burger which I have to say was good even though I don't like mushrooms. We also tried their cucumber salad which was probably my favorite, it was so refreshing since it was all fresh veggies. And the F&B sauce was the topping on the yummy sundae. I'm glad this place is a couple blocks from the house, Cuz I will be here alot."}
{"text":"Nice staff, convenient location in an industrial office area with few other dining options. Great fries! It's ok, just a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh squeezed OJ. Pretty decent food. Slow service but nice servers. Cliche decor trying to be cool. Obviously a locals only hangout. Not a tourist trap."}
{"text":"I work in the same business center so it's nice to have this spot as a great go-to. For those who want to see their smoothie options, I took a picture for ya. They have a Strawberry Sensation smoothie that isn't listened but is a great option."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our way home from Vegas to grab some breakfast. Came because of the high reviews. Definitely did not disappoint. The staff were very friendly. The food was great. I like that you can pick what you want instead of having preset stuff.   A family had a little boy and I believe it was the owner that let the little guy put the oranges in the juicing machine which made his day. I thought it was adorable.   Thank you! We will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located in an industrial park and a little hard to find but found regardless. It is tucked behind the first building so you have to go in the parking lot to see it. Fries were cooked to perfection for my opinion, I like them a little toasty and never soggy. Burger seemed like it was put in a meat locker though. Wasn't bad, but just did not have that \"I just came off the grill\" feeling. One can tell by the way the cheese does not melt over it right away. Device was friendly and helpful for this being my first time going."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, they are so creative with their specials. My speical Burger 2 days ago was off the hock, cooked perfectly, tasted great, the pretzel bun was dens. it smelled delicious, I couldn't wait and had it on the road. the service is great, no waiting time. I eat at this great place at least 4 times  a week and always happy and satisfied.  don't hesitate to try their food, delicious shakes, orange juice and home made chess cake. Fork and Burger you rock, keep the great quality and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat at for a nice quick breakfast.  I had a good breakfast sandwich, the coffee was just a basic cup of joe and the location was a little hard to find."}
{"text":"Great service, Delicious food, and the prices are affordable.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Where the fork is this place?   Tucked away just West of the Strip is Fork & Burger. This is a modern day small railroad diner or corner cafe from back in the olden days, no frills, just a few updated menu items and very bright decor. When I came here, this place was filled with suits, hard hats, and a crew of chatty secretaries, definitely the local hot spot for the surrounding business park.    Wraps, omelets, deli sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, salads, adult sized PB&J, and of course burgers... America! I went with the burger of the month, \"The Pizza Burger\" fully equipped with homemade marinara sauce, smothered in mozzarella cheese and topped with fried pepperonis, fork yeah! This burger was just plain delicious, the patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the red sauce had a great spicy kick. Sorry ketchup, but you've been replaced when it came to dunking my sweet potato fries.   This is a great place for a lunch meeting or just a straight-up lunch. The customer service is great and they update their social media with weekly and monthly specials constantly, so follow them for a tasty heads up. Depending on what you get it can be a little pricey, but not much more than fast food monstrosity down the street.   Time to tell The Golden Arches to \"fork off\", you've got a new lunch habit."}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim.  I must say we were pleasantly surprised.  We arrived at 11:00 A.M. to try to be ahead of the lunch rush and we were successful. I had the double cheeseburger with fries and it was very well prepared as well as juicy.  The fries seemed to be the crinkle cut frozen style which was cooked perfectly and they had a nice crunch.  We had a youngster with us and he had the hot dog.  It was prepared well with a nice presentation.  This seems like a very well run little burger shack with a friendly staff.  We will put this on our list of regulars places."}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for business. Found this place close-by. First of all, wonderful customer service. I believe the owner is working the register. Great guy, very friendly. Menu is simple and on point. I ordered omelette with eggs, mushrooms and spinach. Food arrived quickly. It was fresh, delicious, and hot. Home potatoes on the side were great, looks like it's their own recipe.   Overall great cafe to grab a bite. If I'm in town again I'm coming here for sure."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for a mediocre burger?? Then head on down to Fork & Burger!! Seriously, if that's what you're looking for you should come here. From the looks of the pics online, it looks like an artisanal hamburger joint. Trust me, it's not. The hamburger was just.....meh. The menu says it's hand packed, but it's tasted like a pre formed and frozen burger you would buy at the grocery store. I also ordered jalapeño poppers which were still cold on the inside. Also, the fountain soda machine was behind the register, which makes me think refills are not free. I'm not for sure on this, as I did ask. Regardless, I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Best BLT I've had in quite awhile. Really tasty bacon and obvious that ingredients are fresh and made to order.  Cute small shop with imaginative decor. Situated in an industrial/office complex, so don't let the location mislead you into thinking you've gone to the wrong place.  Definitely worth your appetite and $."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick lunch that will blow your mind on quality and taste, this is the place to go!!!  I had the Egg & Avo Burger and I almost bought a second it was so good. Fanatic food guys! Keep it up"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch a number of times. Always very tasty and quick service. Chicken Caesar wrap really tasty and their portions are more than plentiful!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot and we don't even eat red meat so we weren't really sure if we should go in but they have plenty of options with chicken and turkey and chicken Phillies we had a great meal will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly service this is the place to go if you want real food in Vegas. My only complaint was we found it on our last day in Vegas. The menue is great lots of healthy choices and beyond fresh."}
{"text":"A hidden lunch treasure. Ruben was very good, lots of great items on the menus. The staff was very friendly treated me as a regular. Highly recommended. Enjoy this great little place."}
{"text":"Solid little burger place. Quick service. Clean restaurant. Food was good, no real complaints. Just probably wouldn't go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"Great find for a quick breakfast/brunch on the way out of Vegas. Rating is closer to 4 1/2 stars, pricing is okay, not expensive, but not a great deal either.  Located in an industrial park just off the freeway easy to get to with good parking. The service was fast and very friendly. Get anything with the house poppyseed sauce. Our group loved the chicken sandwich and the breakfast sandwich on a bagel. The burrito was good but that person wished they had gotten one of the sandwiches instead.  I had the oatmeal, to detox from over eating the days before, and it was really good too (that is if you like oatmeal)."}
{"text":"I found this spot after a flight out from the bay area. A hidden treasure located in the middle of an industrial parkway. They were so welcoming and I later found out they are too originally from the bay area, a beautiful couple that works hard in the kitchen to serve us a delicious meal. I had a turkey burger for lunch, and came back early the next day so i didn't miss out on their mushroom and swiss omelet which was delicious. And they are a win all around."}
{"text":"Clean! Fresh! Kind! Tasteful blend of traditional concepts with creative flare per menu item if you so choose."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall spot next to a bunch of light industrial storefronts. Side dishes include all kinds of fries, tasty coleslaw and crisp cucumber salad. The barbeque bacon burger was the best on the menu with two beef patties topped with melted cheddar and crispy bacon. Would dine again."}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. I was excited to eat here based off the pics but the burgers are small, way to small for the price. Not super flavorful and over cooked. The fries are tasty and the fork n burger sauce is like a great remoulade. I guess if you work near here it's a serviceable place for lunch but DO NOT go out of your way to try this place. Might as well got to Farmer Bros."}
{"text":"I tried Fork & Burger because it was close to work, I prefer smaller local places and like to support them. I called the order in and i got there to pick it up just a little before they said it would be ready. I waited about 5 minutes, no big deal.  Burger was good, fries were hot. Place was clean, busy, quite a few other seated customers that appeared happy and were mostly just finishing up with thier lunch. Prices were fair and competitive. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place just based on the fun name alone. The interior is really cute. Loved the decor. We got a cheese burger with fries & a Philly cheesesteak (beef) with sweet potatoes. The bums we soft, warm. Both sandwiches were decent, juts not special. Regular & sweet potato fries were ok. Unfortunately nothing special that would make us want to come back & price was a bit high for just ok food. Probably great for the businesses who are in area though."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to try this place being as how it is on my way to work. Ordered the steak and cheese omelette with a side of bacon. The bacon was extremely over cooked. I like crispy bacon, but not burnt. The omelette was nothing special and it lacked taste. I feel I could have cooked the same omelette at home. While eating the undercooked potatoes, I noticed that something felt off when chewing. I pulled a five inch black hair out of my mouth. Absolutely disgusted by this, I tossed the rest of the breakfast in the trash. $15 down the drain! I generally try a place twice before writing a review, but today I made an exception. I wish I could at least say that customer service was great, but it wasn't. Done and moving on!"}
{"text":"It's a little over priced for what you get but the atmosphere is charming. I had the Original Fork N Burger. The patty was juicy and the bun was soft. I also liked the sauce. I loved the way it was presented in a stainless tub with newspaper lining. Also a big plus was the crinkle cut fries (my fave). The service was good and I didn't have to wait forever for my food.  Definitely is a return visit in my future"}
{"text":"It's not cheap, not expensive. Not amazing, not bad in any way. Not fancy, not fast food. It's right in the middle on most accounts, that's why it gets 3 stars. The wait seems incredible (especially since I order it medium rare), the location is awkward, and they don't have a spicy brown mustard, which makes me wonder why Annie's has a wider condiment selection. It's an ok burger, but there's much better out there"}
{"text":"Fork & Burger!  5 stars just for the name alone.  I bookmarked this place after reading Bethany E's stellar review a few weeks ago.  I knew it was just a matter of time when I would finally get my fork into one of their burgers.  I specifically wanted January's Burger of the Month, which is two patties, 4 thick slices of bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions.  Fork & Burger named this burger the Resolution Buster Burger because it's high in calorie, high in fats, and well worth cheating on your weight-loss New Year resolution.  I don't do resolutions.  So, it's all good.    I just dined here today and since it's no longer January, the burger is no longer on the menu. I knew that F&B couldn't resist my charm and made one for me any way.  Heck, it doesn't hurt to ask, right?  The burger is stacked, very delicious, and worth every extra minute of cardio that I have to do tonight.  At only $12.50, this beast of a burger is a deal.  The thick pieces of bacon are strategically placed between each patty and cheese, which means bacon & cheese on every bite.     Fork & Burger's menu consist of burgers (of course), sandwiches, breakfast, and salads.  Everything on their menu seems to be priced just right or better.  I look forward to coming back for their breakfast, the patty melt, and their other specialty burgers.  Fork & Burger may not be Yelp famous yet. But they have been recognized by Yelp HQ as a business with a 4.5 star average.  I'm so glad that I was working in the area today.  Fork & Burger is good As Fork!!    TIP #1:  Located off Valley View & Post.   TIP #2:  Look for their Burger of the Month TIP #3:  The Sloppy Jack (Turkey, Pepper Jack Cheese, & FB Sauce) is their signature burger TIP #4:  They deliver.  Check out their website for restrictions.  TIP #5:  Churro pancakes and fresh baked cookies at F&B TIP #6:  They supply outlets and cables to charge your phones.    2017 Yelp Review #122   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Though it was difficult to find this establishment, the cashier/cooks were welcoming, the menu was easy to understand, and the place is extremely clean. We ordered the breakfast burrito which was very good.I can definitely see this place being busy in the future"}
{"text":"I tour with theatre groups professionally, so I've been to all types of restaurants. I also, don't write reviews often, but HAD to with Fork and Burger!!!!  First off, I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat because everything looked so good!!! I decided on the chicken sandwich and it was cooked to perfection and the flavors just melded together! As a side I had the coleslaw and it tasted just like mom's(A+)!!!!  The establishment was clean and bright and the staff was super friendly and helpful! It seemed like there was an issue(maybe with something in the kitchen and I only noticed because I pick up on these things), HOWEVER my food came out in a timely manner and with a smile!!! No complaints here!  Can't wait to come through again and try something else!!!"}
{"text":"High quality food in located in a business park and only open for breakfast and lunch.  The philly Cheesesteak is top notch and the fries are addictive.  I was visiting a friend at the business park and I saw the receptionist eating what looked to be the perfect Philly Cheesesteak!  I asked her where she got it and she said it was take out from the place next door.  If you work in this business park, then you would be insane not to eat at Fork & Burger at least three times a week.  I go out of my way to eat lunch here!"}
{"text":"Thankful to the Yelp reviews, this place was indeed hard to find but yes worth the trip. While we were in town we stopped in. The husband had a Philly type sandwich, I had a burger, and my son a burrito. All the food was really good and the fries were very good as well. I hope this place does well. It was a nice change of pace from the strip."}
{"text":"I work close by and have lunch here atleast twice a week and absolutely love it! The chicken fingers and grilled PbandJ are my favs. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area. The decor inside the dining room is modern yet still has a cozy feel. The highlight of Fork and Burger are the wonderfull staff who are always polite and attentive."}
{"text":"The food is great, the prices are very reasonable for fresh beef burgers, fries are always hot and enjoyable, the only thing better is the staff. They are responsive, food comes out quick; it's the kind of place you go to where they learn your name and treat you like family. I work across the street from this place and often am in a hurry to eat and go. They are always nice, food tastes great, always clean and personable. When I don't have time I often call in my order in and they are prompt to deliver. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service ordered a breakfast burrito to go ! no other people ahead of me when ordered took over 20 min for one burrito. Burrito was very moosh. Rather have farmer boys!   This place used to have an amazing philly cheese steak! Disappointed"}
{"text":"It was good.  It's a place that sells burgers but was probably designed by a female. It had a feminine vibe to it--almost like a finger sandwich and soup joint might have. However, you could get a big fat juicy hamburger.   The quality of food was good and tasty. The serving sizes were just right--almost too small, but not.   Seating was OK, but I could see how that could be a potential problem. It's not a large place.   Would go back, fo sho! The staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food! If we lived nearby, we'd be back, but we were just passing through. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is a spot that you will probably only find by Yelp, Word of Mouth, etc..... the location is in business park, a little difficult to just \"run across\" , BUT completely worth the searching out! I had the SloppyJack, (Turkey, PepperJack, Cold Slaw, with F&B Sauce on Rye) comes with fries.... it was GREAT!!!!! Seriously, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! I am anxious to try other things on the menu, but I love that Sloppy Jack so much that I might have to order it again next time as well......."}
{"text":"Just discovered this great little place.  Good menu and choices. Will be back to try another one of their great choices."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minuets for one of the meals, which is not hot. People who ordered after us got their food before us and I am still waiting for my food at 55 minuets. Service is garbage, tables are dirty staff doesn't care and food is average. Wish I could give zero stars as I anticipate cold food to be delivered.  Finally got my food one hour later. Not surprised that it was cold.   Garbage food and French Dip certainly not worth 10 dollars. Could have bought Sizzlean and had a better experience."}
{"text":"Just ate there and will eat there again.  The food is good.... really good.  They had some special today where they gave you a free smoothie with the purchase of a meal.  Real good deal.  The smoothies were excellent too.    My one notch on this place was they lacked some of the small things.  For example: - My burger got brought out about 5 minutes before my friends burger.   - Same story with the smoothie.  Mine came out before the meal arrived while his arrived post delivery of the burgers. - The food was delivered with no napkins - They were slow to clean up other tables which had food trays on them.    Let me be very clear - the food is excellent.  I will eat here again.  Just a few things can be done to make this a top tier experience."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times since it is right around the corner from work, gets busy since there aren't many food places near by. Workers are friendly. Would recommend the Ruben sandwich comes with fries and a drink for only $10.   If your in the area give it a try they also have breakfast."}
{"text":"Meh.  Difficult to find and with average food, Fork & Burger served me up a dry burger. When ordering, the young man rushed me (even though the place was nearly empty) with a \"doyouwantitasitcomes?\" I said yes, assuming that meant some kind of condiments. However, it arrived to our table with only lettuce, tomato, and pungent onions. No cheese, no mayo, no mustard, and no place get these to add it on.  She got chicken fingers and fries. They're they \"straight outta' the freezer\" type and were very dry.  The food was edible and the prices reasonable, but there are much better choices in this area."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in SW Vegas that has an east coast vibe. It's located in the industrial park which I think is great for all the workers in the area for lunch time. I went there today and had lunch with a friend. I got the Jersey Diner Burger, it had gravy, raw onions and fries on the burger. Definitely stuck to my gut. Chris took our order, he was super helpful and had great personable skills. I know this place is a little over a month new, but I see it being very successful."}
{"text":"The crew here at eco-tint ordered delivery for lunch today! and it was delicious! my chicken sandwich was perfection!!! we got our food in a timely matter. we ordered online off of yelp and i even had to call to pay by card.

{"text":"Delivered to us yesterday! Great service*, timely delivery, friendly, great prices and the best part - THE FOOD! We ordered a variety of food and everyone was happy with everything ;)  **When ordering over the phone, there was a little bit of trouble hearing on their side, but they made sure they got everything right before ending the phone call."}
{"text":"Fork & Burger is located in a fairly industrial warehouse area.  It's tucked inside the plaza and is facing south, so you won't see it at all from Decatur.  If you're looking for the place, keep on driving in and it'll be there.  The interior decor is fairly basic, but gets the job done.  I really like how they have some counter height seats with phone chargers.  I seriously needed some juice and the plugs definitely helped out.  Food: I had the Egg and Avo, and a fresh squeeze OJ.  There was a sign on the menu saying the Egg and Avo can sub chicken for beef.  I asked the cashier which was better, she said she never had the beef and really couldn't tell me.  I opted for the original chicken.  The burger came out OK.  It was a decent size, but the egg was a bit over cooked and chicken was close to dry.  They served those really puffy frozen fries, so nothing to be excited about there.  The OJ tasted good, but it was room temp.  Maybe my issue, but I like my OJ chilled.  Perhaps they can stick the OJ's in the fridge?  Service: I only encountered the cashier, so this may not reflect all employees.  Seriously, she had absolutely no enthusiasm at all.  She was nice, but every word was monotonous and I could tell that she did not want to be there.    Overall, there's not many burger choices in the area, so this is really it if you want a burger.  The burger was decent, but nothing to crave for.  Service was meh."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on our way home to San Diego. Glad we did! Great food and service.  Everyone was happy with their food. Will stop next time we pass through!"}
{"text":"I work not far from there, this is the 4th time I placed an order for delivery and I absolutely love how efficient and fast they are!! Ordered and in less time than what was said to me my food arrived."}
{"text":"Nice little place in industrial park....good to find hot food in such a location. Stop in you won't be sorry...I had breakfast, nothing exceptional....simply good service...breakfast kinda greasy, wouldn't take much more effort to make your ingredients a bit more healthy and would increase your business !! But thanks to Yelp I found a fairly good place to eat while conducting business in this area."}
{"text":"Food this little hidden Gem just south of The Strip tucked away in a industrial park off Valley View. The service was quick and friendly and the food was fresh and phenomenal! I had the Philly Cheese Steak, cooked perfectly with thin slices of steak, gooey cheese , grilled sweet peppers and caramelized onions served on soft French roll.  They offer fries, sweet potato fries, chips, cucumber salad, Cole Slaw , or cottage cheese with mandarin oranges. Served with thick slices of deli pickles. I finished everything eventually and it was all delicious, fresh and served with a smile! I will be back."}
{"text":"This was a super great find. GPS had some trouble navigating, but happened to look at the right building at the right time and located it.   Got the signature fork and burger with an extra patty and the green smoothie. Holy cow that burger was excellent! the patties were perfectly seasoned and the sauce they put on it, which looks suspiciously like thousand island, really enhanced the rest of the flavors. It was definitely eaten with a fork as the sauce made it a bit messy, but I LOVED every bite.  I was not overly impressed with the smoothie. It was good, but nothing worth bragging about. They oopsed and upsized it at no extra charge, which was a nice surprise. It did have a really nice fresh flavor that worked with the burger."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great ambiance and great customer service I'll make this a frequent stop while I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Family and I came for lunch (breakfast stops at 11:30)I had  the double cheese with bacon and hubby got the egg & Avo burger. The burgers were awesome and huge! Ask for some of the F&B sauce, I had it with my fries! Service was great, staff made us feel welcomed! Did I mention freshly squeezed orange juice?? Glad we chose this burger joint to eat at before leaving Las Vegas. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To begin with, I am not someone who takes the time to write reviews but this needed to be said. I stopped into Fork And Burger this week while driving through on business. I can't say anything else except WOW!! What a find!! I had an omelette with the fresh squeezed juice and it was perfect!! Exactly the way I wanted.   I have been told by some co workers that this used to be a different eatery. Many of my co workers hadn't gone yet.  I changed that!!! I brought a few of us 2 days later and got the cheesesteak. It was exactly what I was hoping. Thin meat and melted cheese served with choice of sides. ( I had the cucumbers. ) All of my local co workers thoroughly enjoyed their meal and are happy to report they have found a new local haunt!!   Kudos to the super hospitable staff. I can't wait to see the business flourish. Go small businesses!!! Wishing every success!! Can't wait to come back !!"}
