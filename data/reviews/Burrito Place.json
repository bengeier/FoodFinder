{"text":"I had a large chicken burrito here today. I don't live in the area, but I was at Kim's Optical (gonna review Kim's shortly) a few doors down buying glasses and saw the Burrito Place and thought I'd give it a try.  The burrito was about $9 with tax. When I asked what the difference was between the regular and the large, the guy said \"same size tortilla, but with the large you get TONS of toppings.\" So I ordered the large.  I watched the other guy load up the tortilla. Lots of beans, some rice. When it came to the chicken--literally a tablespoon full. Same for everything else--though he put about half a tablespoon of guacamole on the burrito. He put maybe 5 or 6 strands of shredded cheese on the burrito. (I am not exaggerating at all, by the way.)  If this was \"tons\" of toppings, I hate to see how little they put on the smaller sized burrito.  I was disappointed because it certainly did not live up to the description of TONS of toppings that the guy who sold it to me claimed. It was bland--I could really only taste beans, which weren't spicy at all and needed salt. One bite had all the guacamole and tomato, and THAT bite tasted OK. The rest was pretty useless. Filling, yes, but no flavour, no noticeable chicken, cheese, or guacamole, just beans. Have you ever had a NoName bean-and-cheese burrito that NoFrills has in the frozen section for $1 each? Eat two of those instead. Tastes exactly the same as this place, except the NoName burrito is spicier.  I should have trusted my instinct and walked out without ordering when I saw the cashier's filthy fingernails. But I was hungry and didn't have a clue where else to eat at Yonge and Finch. Silly me."}
{"text":"There was enough plastic in my 3 beef tacos to wrap around a coke can twice. Went back and got a refund, but the owner insisted that it was a reasonable mistake when making tacos. He claimed it was from their cheese bag, but everyone knows it pretty easy to open a plastic bag without dozens of scraps falling in. I'm currently digesting some plastic so I just wanted to warn you! Avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them literally last night around 8pm (I live no further than 10 mins away) and it arrived promptly and food was decent for Mexican food in the area... Everything else is laughable Didn't really get an opportunity to enjoy the meal as I was feeling rather sick when it arrived so I tried ordering again today around 2pm. I live directly north of them on Yonge st just north of steeles and even after a tip that left the driver baffled enough to come back to my door and make sure I hadn't overpaid, he decided today was too far of a drive to make for my $50+ order NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER will they be receiving my business again. Not to mention their tacos were maybe 5% meat and 95% lettuce and the burrito was about as satisfying as subway sub and I HATE subway. Mostly just wanted more fries supreme. But I guess not..."}
{"text":"The mixed beef and chicken burrito came out quickly and was delicious to eat. Vegetables were nice and crisp, meat was tender and hot. The supreme fries were also amazing. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Best burrito place Literally!  Food is always done right! The hot sauce is to die for if you are looking for a fiery kick.  My all time favorite hot sauce, I'm hooked! The fish burrito is juicy and delicious! The Supreme fries are a must try! The secret sauce makes it so amazing and makes you want more!  It's a small place by finch station. The owner is a super cool guy, very energetic, passionate and remembers all his customers. Check it out and you will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner so I've eaten here a few times (I just ordered it for pick-up as I type this!).   I always get the same thing so I can't speak to anything else on the menu but I always get a small bean and cheese with pinto beans on white with a large supreme fries. Someone else wrote that no one makes them as good as the owner does and that is true. He will really stuff the burrito while other employees don't fill it up as much. I'm not greedy though and what I do get is still always enough. I always get mine spicy which is always hit and miss - sometimes it's spicy as hell and sometimes it's not spicy at all.   The supreme fries with beef are delicious but same thing - if the boss doesn't make 'em, it's not as full.   I always get consistently good food and service so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I ordered the large beef burrito and beef taco.  The burrito was slightly better than Barburito down the street, but definitely bigger, and definitely much better then Burrito boyz (which has really high review for some reason but was the worse burrito I ever had).  The beef taco was awesome.  The beef was nicely flavored, juicy, and was a nice portion.  Burrito place is my new go to burrito place around Yonge and Finch/Sheppard."}
{"text":"This has got to be the WORST Mexican place I've ever been to in my life. If you want taco bell, get that cause it's way more affordable, filling, and tastier... (I think taco bell is gross too. I seriously think they use old elpaso taco shells. U know the ones that taste like stale cardboard you buy from loblaws?.... Service is typical: get you in and get you the hell out. No smiles. The microwave they warm the filling up in is quite visible too.   Can't believe I have to give this place even 1 star... Gg"}
{"text":"Good burrito, good service. Definitely would come back for a quick mexican fix. I still want to try more from the menu"}
{"text":"Had a burrito here, I ordered black beans, chicken, cheese and sour cream on my burrito. The staff was very friendly. To my surprise the burrito was really good and I highly recommend trying this restaurant. Also very well priced."}
{"text":"Their burittos are juicy but the best thing to get on the menu is without a doubt their supreme fries, it's a great filler while waiting for the bus if you just happen to be really hankering for something to eat. Also, get a bottle of Jarritos soda to wash it down.   The only problem is they don't have the Jarritos Mexican Cola flavour drink, but other than that the food is very decent for the price and the staff are quite friendly and will often sometimes have a little joke with you."}
{"text":"Came on lunch break with my coworkers. We all ordered fish tacos, after waiting 20 minutes we received our tacos in takeout bags (which we didn't ask for). We opened our containers to find ice cold tacos filled with lettuce (we had to search to find the fish in them). Not worth the money, left disappointed. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"i had the tacos and fries supreme  the tacos were great, fresh ingredients and flavourful  the employees did nto respond to my \"thank yous\" or have a good day, they appear to hate their lives unfortunately  the fries supreme were a problem....they were not fully cooked, almost soggy and raw :("}
{"text":"Wasn't good. Food was cold, practically no meat in the burrito, and portions weren't balanced. Service was brutal as well. Go to burrito boys"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the burritos here. I ordered the chicken burrito and my boyfriend had the shrimp burrito. His shrimps were microwaved. That should have been a sign to gtfo! We already paid and did not want to be rude as I was given high praises about the place.   After opening up the burritos they did not taste good. Nothing was fresh, you can see the nasty lettuce that's withering and brown. The sauce wasn't good and the avocado/guacamole was old and bland.   I would not come back here."}
{"text":"After Two times of visiting; I've decided to write this review.  First adventure of visiting; Friday night of thanksgiving, me and three buddies had no one but us three; we came in and ordered a feast, food came out quick, now here's the twist...I never eat fish tacos ever; for once I tried it under the owners guarantee. It was amazing! I wanted seconds! It was tender yet favor filled unlike other places will blank taste.  Second time of visit: more surprise! I decided to try the shrimp and chicken steak mix. I was shocked that the shrimp was fresh at 2am in the morning. Almost perfectly cooked, juicy and tender.   Sum up: after muti-dishes from burritos, tacos to salad, fries and nachos I'm giving the place a 5 star! Great owner, great food, good speed, open kitchen for viewing and LLBO+ exotic drinks!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again last week and it was he best burrito I've had in a long long time. I got everything in mine except for beans and it was delicious and super filled!  The wait was quite long tho during lunch hour, so I'd suggest not going during that time.  The price was good too only 6.99 and I was super full!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito and it was the worst burrito I have had. The taste was extremely bland and there was so little chicken that it felt like a veggie burrito. But when I did bite into some chicken, it was also very bland so that didn't even matter. Definitely not worth the price. If you are looking to buy a decent burrito then don't go there. But if you are really craving for a burrito while you are in the area, then maybe settle for this one.  When I went there there was no one in line but myself and I had to wait for more than 10 mins. It was around 4:30pm."}
{"text":"3 tacos for $6.75 on a drizzly Saturday. What could possibly go wrong? The answer, in case you're wondering, was served up in a frayed straw basket from the Burrito Place at Yonge and Finch..   The tacos were made with cold flour tortillas and a little more than half the filling (pork, but they also have the usual beef and chicken, plus fish and soy) you'd expect in a standard-issue taqueria. Main ingredient was clearly the chopped iceberg lettuce, followed by some chunks of tomato (not bad) and a sprinkling of a shredded orange-and-white cheeselike product. This was dosed in a very sweet version of the sour cream-based sauce found on Baja-style fish tacos.    Bottom line: cloying, bland and utterly devoid of the rich, complex flavor that makes Mexican food so popular worldwide. I asked for hot sauce, and received a ghost pepper concoction that was plenty hot, but also flavorless and apparently pointlessly sweetened too.   On the plus side, both the folks working there were pleasant and there's a cute mural  on the wall. Just don't go there for the food.  So just how bad was it? Let's put it this way: when I got home an hour later I went immediately to the kitchen and made a quesadilla with a couple healthy jolts of Cholula, just to get that sickly sweet taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Came one Friday around 1225pm for lunch and just missed the rush! After I ordered, a whole line up (almost to the door) was behind me! The restaurant looked quite small and dark, and to be quite honest, a little dingy. Nevertheless, I was excited to try their food as I've heard good things and seen the line!  I had ordered a steak burrito bowl, which was a burrito minus the wrap and is priced as a large. The bowl came with all the toppings they had (guac included!!). The order was fairly quick, but I would have to leave this as a very mediocre meal. I found the beans too soupy, which made my bowl terribly soggy. It was so bad I felt like I was drinking soup! Another thing I missed was the corn! They had no corn! I usually like corn with my burritos to give a hint of sweetness. On the positive side, portions are fair with comparison to the price.   Overall, the flavours were quite one toned and left a fairly 'meh' taste in my mouth. I would actually much prefer Burrito Boyz, a 5 minute walk down the street."}
{"text":"Im gonna give this a 4 star. Nothing really i can complain about except the smell of the place.  Staff is friendly, always greet you as soon as you walk in the door.. Who doesnt like that.  The food is good, im not huge on mexican food but when I do decide to get I only get from here.  Fries supreme is great, dont miss it  However if u do get fries, ASK for a fork, cause apparently its only my common sense to include one for fries  .. :)"}
{"text":"I will be honest. While it was favourful and tasty, it wasn't worth the price, I would probably need two burrito to fill me. I guess I should have taken the extra time and gone to burrito boyz."}
{"text":"This is my burrito place. I always get the steak and chicken mix and it's always so nicely layered with stuff but with each bite you get all the ingredients. Also their supreme fries are also amazingly good. They don't hold back on toppings."}
{"text":"Burrito place is THE place for burritos. Fresh ingredients,  clean restaurant,  great music, and a cold refreshing Jarrito. This is a must eat for everybody and they treat each and everyone customer with a friendly and welcoming attitude. Great job."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the burritos and also the fries (absolutely delicious). Customer service is good as well, although the food can often take 10 mins or more...it's worth the wait though! Great for late night eats in the yonge and finch area!"}
{"text":"It should be two stars, but I'm going to be nice and give it 3.  This is probs the ONLY mexican-ish place in the area, so its a nice change. DEFO way better than John Andy's. That was just..yeah.   Anyways. I stopped at about 10pm on Friday Night to get some noms because I realized I hadn't eaten all day and I didn't wanna drink on an empty stomach.  It was pretty packed and there was a line for food.  The owner took my order and said it would be about ten minutes. I ordered the steak burrito combo (w/ Fries and a Mango Jarritos)  While waiting, you can see right into the kitchen, and it's pretty cool. He's pretty vocal about what's he's doing,so you  know exactly what's happening.  True to his word, I got my food exactly ten minutes later.  So here the skinny:  1. My burrito wasn't the greatest. It was understuffed, and undergrilled. It fell too easily.  2. The fries (which I knew were the last order of the day b/c he said \"after this no more fries\", and also were just sitting already cooked in the basket) were inedible. Sorry. I'm really about that, b/c they were shoestrings, and you rarely see a good shoestring at restaurants these days.  3. The habanero sauce I got on the side was PHENOMENAL. Anastasiya was crying after she tried it.  4. Jarritos was delicious as usual.   My bill came up to 10.50. Not too bad, considering the fries were a large portion and the jarritos was a dollar extra.   I can definitely see myself coming back here. It's not the best, but it's a good effort, and the owner definitely has heart."}
{"text":"We ordered the 3pc fish and 3pc steal tacos.  The food was flavourful but the fish and beef was not warm.  Obviously it was cooked already but felt like it was left out in the open for a while.    It was all right."}
{"text":"Just finished a large beef and chicken burrito.  It was awesome.  Tastey, filing and inexpensive.  My girlfriend had three pork soft tacos and she is addicted.  She would normally choose the fish but the pork here was so good she will never go back to fish.  If you like it hot ask for hot sauce. It will be provided on the side and it's very spicy/hot and very good.  Overall much better than any Mexican chain restaurant. We'll definitely be baaaaccckkkk."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. Food quality is up to par with other burrito joints. They also offer other variety of food on the menu which is always a plus."}
{"text":"The burritos were not filling and over priced.  You're better off going to burrito boyz just down the road.  They are so much better."}
{"text":"I saw this place open some time ago and have been dragged here a couple of times by coworkers but have never ordered anything for myself.  A few of us who had never eaten here before decided to give it a go and we came last Friday for lunch. Although it was a later lunch, this place was packed to the rafters.   I ordered a small chicken burrito garnished with most of the toppings. The burrito itself was a good size and plenty for lunch, the unfortunately thing was, it complete lacked any resemblance of flavour... or chicken for that matter. Definitely not worth the money.  It left me wondering how this place was so busy. I will likely come back and try something else because it is so close to my work but I would never go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"My personal favourite Mexican food in the city so far - the price is right, the food is always fresh and delicious and in decent portions (except the tacos, but they're tasty nonetheless) and the staff are usually quite nice. One guy is a bit standoffish but I think that's because he's European or something, the owner (at least I think he's the owner) is always super sweet. Great place, so glad it's in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"At this end of Yonge, it's mostly Korean, Persian, and pizza. I really want to see a burrito/taco place make it. The old 24 hour John Anderson's gave up the ghost recently and this place moved in. I'm kind of glad John Anderson's is dead. Every time I go by that place I'm taken back to John Anderson's presidential bid, reminded I'm not only OLD but my head is filled with entirely useless memories (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Anderson).  It's clean, modern, and has a nice deck patio for summer. Now I do have a theory that when a Mexican restaurant uses a Mexican food term in its name, you should order that and nothing else. In defiance, I went with the tacos. Prices are good. Three good sized soft tacos, loaded, for $7 and change after tax. I got the beef. And mild sauce. They, alas, go Taco Bell ground beef style, not slow cooked and shredded.   Given the location, not sure why they didn't consider going Korea/Mexican fusion, which is all the rage in the USA.   I'll be back, certainly, to try the burritos (also quite reasonably priced). I want to like this place. With luck, they'll tweek the menu and make it something more than just another burrito place that's popping up everywhere downtown."}
{"text":"I lived right beside this place for 8 years and never ventured in, but today I did and thank goodness! Solid burrito! And really chill atmosphere. Staff were very friendly and great! I had the beef and chicken mixed burrito size small and it more than filled me up for only $7.90 incl taxes!! They got the medium spice level JUST RIGHT too!!! Ill definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tasted like a mexicanized shawarma..  so, good but not really Mexican. I may end up there again."}
{"text":"Been here few times, their food is definitely worth trying and quite delicious. But that is based on a opinion that has only had Taco Bell and Chipotle to compare."}
{"text":"This is a foul excuse for a restaurant. I ate this burrito an hour ago and I am experiencing shooting pains in my stomach. The establishment is abhorrent, you could probably find a better functioning quick service burrito restaurant in the middle of Alaska. In fact, I wouldn't even call this place \"quick service\". I waited for 20 minutes for this lousy burrito and nobody even asked me if I needed anything while I waited. It feels as though there is something alive in my stomach as a result of this burrito. The chicken must have been under cooked, because I feel the salmonella poisoning beginning a blitzkrieg through my bowels as we type. After I am done with this message I will be calling the EPA and the FDA to immediately close this business down. I will not be dining at \"Burrito Place\" ever again. Oh and- next time, try and think of a better name, rather than using the most bland and boring one that comes to mind."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, enjoyed the burrito. Yes I agree it could have been stuffed with way more meat. But it was enjoyable and not overly priced. It was large in proportion and I even had enough to take some back home."}
{"text":"At the time I visited this place there were no other burrito places in the area.  I can tell you that I'm not surprised the food wasn't that great.  There was even a lineup too likely because the competitor down Yonge Street hadn't opened yet.    I had the chicken burrito which took quite some time even though there were more than 5 staff working behind the counter.  All of them looked confused and unsure of their duties.  My suggestion is either grab a hot dog just outside at Finch Station or make the extra trek down to Burrito Boyz a few blocks away.  If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant I've ever had. The restaurant is clean, modern and the workers there so warm and welcoming. I had a beef burrito and it was amazing. I like how there are right next to Finch Subway Station. Easy for people who want good food to munch on for the ride home or work on the train."}
{"text":"I came to get take out and was stunned how the girl working at the till swears while speaking on the phone.  Both staff members were really loud and was engaging in distasteful conversation.  Weird vibe at this place.   Don't think I'll come here again."}
{"text":"When walking to the bus I noticed this new burrito placed opened and needed to try it, so today seeing that I'm always looking for something quick and easy for lunch, I dragged a fellow yelper and got lunch.  I picked up a small chicken burrito with beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and burrito sauce in it.  I found that the chicken in the burrito to be a little to bland. The topping options I found to be very slim. I think if they had red onions, green peppers, corn etc. it may have made the burrito a whole lot better.  I will give this place a try once again as I do believe every restaurant deserves a second chance to make an impression."}
{"text":"A random thought of tequila shots lead to a craving for Mexican food. And given this was the only listing nearby, I braved cold and reached on a Friday evening.  This is a small establishment right near the Finch station. The place was completely empty with just one lady holding the fort.  I got a Chicken Quesadilla and Chicken Burrito to go. The preparation of Quesadilla itself raised concerns since I'm used to grill pressed way of making them. It had most of the ingredients still something was amiss.  Burrito was a good affair, not exceptional yet tasty. Both items had generous amount of meat which in my opinion should be seasoned well.  Not too pricey."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice, the first time it was ok, the owner is nice but the last time I was there I got sick after eating the veg beans n cheese burrito. We orderd 3 of them and all of us felt sick after so I wasn't just a one off. Also his staff isn't as good at making them as he is. We have decided to find a new burrito spot unfortunately."}
{"text":"Burrito Place is definitely one of my all time favourites - it is a must visit every time I head back to uptown. I just love their chicken/ chicken steak mix burritos. Personally, I like their burritos a lot more than the ones from the chain restaurants (e.g., Chipotle).  The tortilla wrapper is perfectly crispy and the ingredients are always fresh. I can eat like 2 burritos from this place for a single meal.  Also, their nacho fries are good and cheap. 120% value meal."}
{"text":"Quality burrito places are hard to come by uptown, especially right in the center of Korean-town.  It's not anything outstanding like burrito bandidos or burrito boyz, but the ingredients they use I recall is not only fresh, but they give generous portion of protein as well! Not only that, all burritos and tacos comes with guacamole!"}
{"text":"Hands down the tastiest taco/Burrito and everything Mexican with a nice touch that makes u drool for days on the instant thought of the food u had.  Amazing friendly staff and the price is just right.  Try them and dont miss the fish Burrito..  MY FAVOURITE IS THEIR SPECIALITY FRIES.... YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"Went there one night after walking into another restaurant and being turned away because it was 10 pm on a Monday and apparently the kitchen was closed. The reason I say apparently is because the place was packed and didn't look like it was closing anytime soon. I am super glad I walked into this little gem. It definitely touched the spot with the craving I was having to enjoy a late night snack with bold flavours.  I ordered the chicken burrito loaded to the max. The friend I was with is a super picky eater so he ordered the taco's with just cheese and meat, NOTHING else.. pretty sad I know. My Burrito was kicking with tons of flavours, and filled to the rim with everything you would expect to find in a Burrito.   I also found the service to be great! I felt like it was very family oriented behind the counter which is nice to see know a days. Being so close to my place I will be making a visit here again. I enjoyed my meal and can't wait to try something new on the menu the next time around."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and burritos, fairly reasonably priced. Belly up to the front counter for service, but you can also get beer and tequila here. No torta or salsa verde, though..."}
{"text":"This place has lots of potential. Friendly staff, good location, affordable, and good flavor. However execution is a bit off.   When approaching the establishment at night, it's hard to tell it's open from across the street. Sure they have an \"open\" sign but you don't really know if they left the sign on by mistake. More lighting would certainly help.   I ordered a chicken and steak burrito. The flavor was on point though I wish there was more meat found inside. The tortilla used doesn't hold up to the amount of liquid found in the beans. As a result the burrito was falling apart just a few minutes after ordering.   I think I will be back to try the fries supreme which comes recommended"}
{"text":"Mediocre burrito joint that serves tacos and nacho fries as well. I tried both the fish and beef tacos from this place and both were on par with the quality that you can get from Taco Bell. Each taco was mostly comprised of lecture, tomato and their secret sauce that essentially tasted like Big Mac sauce. The protein was lacking in both, and the overall flavour wasn't anything like what you'd expect for a taco. I would say that it was more akin to eating a burger minus the patty.   A disappointing meal overall, as it was neither affordable nor satisfying. Maybe their burritos are better, but I would not recommend the tacos at all."}
