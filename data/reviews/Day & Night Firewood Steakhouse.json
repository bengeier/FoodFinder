{"text":"Terrible food. The soup seems like it's canned and the steaks are cheap cuts of meat that have probably not been aged properly. The service is terrible. But not as terrible as the food! It's worse!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for 80 bucks for 2 for a 6-course dinner. It didn't disappoint.  The food was great.  The atmosphere was great as well.  The staff were friendly and nice but a few of them didn't know much English.  Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Day and Night is a great place for steaks that are char-broiled to perfection with fresh seafood (lobster, crab, oyster). A decent local Steak House with an oriental twist to it  where the prices are good with the set menu options! The set menu I ordered was $88.00 between 2 people before tax, and comes with an all-you-can-eat salad bar, a choice of Lobster Bisque or Onion Soup, a Lobster appetizer weighed at 4 pounds cooked sashimi style and grilled style (might I add, the sashimi was AMAZING! No fishy odour and it was crisp and fresh!), a shared entrée of a 24 oz. T-Bone Steak, and for dessert a funnel cake! All of this food was for only for $44 a person which was a great value for a Surf and Turf Dinner!! If I was at Ruth's Chris I would be paying at least minimum of $60 EACH! Service is great and staff is always super friendly. I usually go here every couple of months and I have never been disappointed which is why I keep coming back to this restaurant. Definetly a great place to check out for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here with the groupon. The food was good with Chinese style steakhouse. We ordered the main course of lamb and sirloin steak. The lamb was good but the sirloin was so so. Not too much favor in it. The service was good but the music was kind of weird. May come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner, loved the lobster brisque, foie gras, Angus beef and dessert. Food and customer service are excellent."}
{"text":"I bought Groupon for two. Food is not impressive, service is very good.   Salad....okay Foie Gras.... Just okay Lobster Soup.... Disappointed, just have potatoes Lamp... Okay Dessert ... okay"}
{"text":"Very disappointed experience at this restaurant. Very poor customer service with bad quality of food. My friend ordered a steak at medium rare but they ended up burn the steak. The server did not apologize when we complained about it. She even convinced my friend to pack the steak home. I don't think that is acceptable and we will never go back to give another try."}
{"text":"Day & Night has definately changed since the last time I've been here. The décor is much more sophisticated but it still has somewhat of a tacky vibe to it. This is YELP, so obviously it is all about the food and service not the décor. Let's move on:  My girlfriend and I went there a couple of night ago because she was craving oysters. We walked in and immediately the service was bad. Two servers saw us, made eye contact and then walked away.  We stood there for at least 5 minutes before we were seated. We sat down and looked through the menu. They have fixed menus, which is nice because you get an appetizer, salad, soup, entrée and dessert.  The price varies on your choice.  Our server came over and gave us water and asked if we were ready to order. My girlfriend asked about their oysters and our server told us that there is a 50% off oyster's promotion. She was super excited and asked what kind of oysters they had. Our server spoke VERY quietly. She had to ask him to speak up and with a tight smile on their face and attitude in their voice told her to go and look for herself.  I thought that was a bit rude. Anyway, she made her decision and ordered a dozen oysters.  On top of the oysters she also ordered the lobster fixed menu with half a lobster as her appetizer, the house salad, lobster bisque soup, and the striploin steak. I ordered butterfly garlic tiger shrimp as my appetizer, the house salad, lobster bisque soup, and the rib eye.   (This is the order of the food that came out to us, just a fyi)  House salad: It was divided into 3 portions. Somewhat sweet pickled cucumbers, soba noodles, and tomato wedges in balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely something different than I am use to. The soba noodles were good though. To be honest, I miss their AYCE salad bar.  Oysters: Since I don't eat oysters myself, I asked my girlfriend to rate it. She loved them. Stated that it was fresh, creamy, everything that she wanted and was very satisfied with it. She gave it a 5/5.  ______________________________________________________  At this point of the evening, my girlfriend asked one of the servers if they could bring her a bowl with lemon in it to wash her hands so she wouldn't have to miss her meal since they were sending our dishes out pretty fast, the server looked at her like she was nuts and told her that she can go use the washroom because they don't do that here and walked away. My girlfriend was slightly confused when the server came back with wet naps and said \"this is all we have.\"  ______________________________________________________  Appetizer: The butterfly garlic tiger shrimps were delicious. Nice and fresh. The garlic did not overpower the sweet taste of the shrimp which is perfect. My girlfriend had half of a lobster. She gobbled that up and loved it.  Soup: We both got the lobster bisque soup because I remember how amazing this soup was the last time I was here. Our server brought out their amazing bread first. It is beautifully crunchy on the outside and super nice and soft on the inside. Don't know how they make it but it's one word: YUMMY. The soup on the other hand was disappointing. We had more potatoes in our soup than lobster pieces. The soup also tasted like it was watered down.   Entrée: I had the rib eye cooked medium rare & my girlfriend had the striploin cooked medium rare as well. Both plates came with half of a baby potato, half a slice of carrot, Alfa sprouts, and a couple of floweret of broccoli.  We were both disappointed in our food. Our steaks had no taste. Everything was bland to be honest.  My rib eye was super tough. I ended up eating only a quarter of it because I couldn't cut it with my steak knife that they provided. My girlfriend stopped eating hers after one bite.   Dessert: We asked our server what the dessert was. They mumbled something and left our table and came back with two plates of mush. I am thinking it is a rice pudding with canned fruits sprinkled throughout. It was too sweet and reminded me of baby food that even my god-son wouldn't eat.    It took about 15 minutes for us to get the bill because our server was busy with other tables and never came back to take away our dishes. We had to flag down another server, who was just standing by the bar not doing anything, to get our bill. Our bill came up to exactly $113.00.  Overall, we had a pretty bad experience for the amount we paid. I am not giving this review a 1 star because this is NOT my first time at Day & Night. My parents and I have been coming to this place ever since they have been opened since my parents know the owner. Usually when I go with my parents, the service is AMAZING, the food food is wonderfully presented and tastes melt-in -our-mouth goodness. I will update my review when I take my parents there for their wedding anniversary in August. Til then, this yelper is very disappointed. =("}
{"text":"Decent food, steak was just okay (it's hard to mess up steak, I'd say). But a little expensive for what it is.   If you're on a date and just want a nice and romantic ambiance late night, this isn't a bad place to go, however."}
{"text":"The food at Day and Night Firewood steakhouse is beyond my expectation!  Steak was cooked to perfection - I asked for medium rare and I got medium rare! Very tender and juicy in the centre, crisp and slightly burned on the outside! I would say this is the best steak that I've ever had!   Service is always excellent!! The waiter kept checking on us to see what we needed and would kindly remind us the plates are hot before we pick up our forks!   Would definitely come back again cause it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster course for $70  Service was great and it had a nice atmosphere. However the same could not be said about the meal itself.   The house salad was nice but I found the portion was rather small.  The lobster chowder was lacklustre in lobster barely finding any in there but besides that, it was a nice chowder. The 3lb lobster itself was made very nice, grilled to keep the sweetness. The biggest let down was the steak sadly.  It had barely any flavour and one of the steaks that came out was very rare when asked for medium rare. The dessert had a nice finish to the meal but nothing spectacular.  Overall I find it a bit too pricey to convince to me to come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a date, he almost didn't make it out alive.   First off I threw up in my mouth, the food was that bad. All the food was canned, frozen, boiled or bagged. If you don't know what food should taste like than maybe you'd like this place. For the price it is not worth it, honestly I wish we had gone to McDonalds. Fast food is better quality and a better price. We were able to joke about the food till desert came, they didn't even try to hide that it was a fruit cup! Please never eat here, don't put yourself through this."}
{"text":"I have been there with my husband to celebrate the wedding anniversary . We feel the environment is very romantic .And the beef steak was very good taste.The oysters were fresh.I will come back next time."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, purchased 6 oysters and a glass of white wine today for $20 bucks.... overall the ambience was quiet, dark and relaxing.  Would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Been here many times and will continue coming back! I love have a romantic steak dinner with my BF or a nice evening with friends.  The variety on the salad bar looked pretty good. Soup was ok. The Steak was prepared perfectly to my tastes and was also delicious.  Very expensive but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Asian-run steakhouse serving good quality certified Angus steak for a reasonable price. Recently renovated and remodelled to match the location in Markham north. The menu offers several set meals and also a la carte items. They have prime rib sets for 4 for about $150 that must be reserved one day in advance. Asked about a recent Groupon deal, the meal must be ordered in advance as only a couple sets reserved for dinner per day.  Dinner set ranges from $39 - $70 differing in appetizers. $39 appetizers is a choice of smoked salmon or smoked duck breast, $45 will give you garlic shrimp, and $70 will serve lobster halves.  5-course set menu includes: Appetizer - garlic shrimp was a bit underseasoned but good size  Salad - caesar salad was tossed fresh and crunchy but not freezing cold  Lobster chowder - had 2 chunks of potato dumplings which I thought was giant lobster pieces  Ribeye 8 oz - charred well, tender and juicy. Some cuts are a bit more tendonous. Can be seasoned more heavily. Gravy served on the side.  Dessert - mille fouille with ice cream, good end to the meal  I'd say it's a pretty decent experience for the price. The restaurant is much more upscale than before but still retained the cozy feeling. Customers are almost all Asian.  The manager William is very knowledgeable and can give you recommendations if you strike up a chat with him. He recommended the wine for us and also gave us a complimentary plate of mussels.  Suggestions: allow customers to customize size of steak based on appetite.  I'd come back again, a nice place for a higher end dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"This restaurant features a menu with different variations of 4-5 course dinners. Most of them include a trip to the all you can eat salad bar, which has a modest selection of vegetables, dressings and jello (yes, jello).  I came here with my dad and we both ordered a 5 course dinner ($32).  The foie gras served on a crostini was sooooo good! The creamy, luscious fatness was amazing. The oyster appetizer was served with an assortment of 6 different types of oysters. They didn't introduce the names of the different types so I had no idea what I was eating. All the oysters tasted fresh and I found the smaller ones had better flavour.   The lobster soup was a disappointment. It was too thick and was filled with all potatoes! I wasn't expecting lobster meat, but at least throw me a chunk of carrot or two!   For the entrees, we ordered a striploin steak and a rack of lamb. We asked for medium rare (or 50% done in asian saying) and it was perfect.   At 10pm, they started to dim the lights and placed fake candles with changing colours on every table. I found the changing colours too distracting so I hid my candle underneath a table menu. After a minute, the waiter returned and placed another candle on the table. I hid the second candle as well and the same waiter rushed back to place a third candle on the table hahaha! I know this is rather irrelevant - I was just very amused with how efficient and oblivious the waiter was."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant because of Groupon; had a 3-course meal with my partner and the food was just ok. This was the moment that I hated foie gras - I don't know if it's supposed to taste like that, seeing that it was my first time. If you have other options for a restaurant and steak, I would suggest heading elsewhere.  The bathrooms were pretty neat, where there were lights on the ceiling and see-through glass floor, where it kind of resembles the bottom of an ocean."}
{"text":"For whatever reason this girl I was seeing thought this was somehow a romantic spot. I've been seeing her for some time, but this was our official first date.   Oh Gawd, I'm tired already talking about this place. All I have to do is think about this restaurant, and immediately I become exhausted.  The décor is horrendous! Fake vines, plastic fruits, Christmas light, and toy seafood. It's as if Aqua Man & Poison Ivy had a child, and that child was a hippy, and this was her Spadina apartment where wearing anything but pyjamas would constitute as being overdressed.  Oh how much longer do I have to go on?  Maybe I'll try to just throw out words and your imagination can put everything together. Ready? Musty, salad bar, lobster sashmi, wood, lightbulps, undercooked, empty, fire hazard, mosquitoes, ketchup, sleeping, Windows 98.  She paid, and I didn't feel guilty about it. That's how much I dislike this place. It's over, I can't believe she took me here. Last date ever!    And set menu at a steakhouse? What?"}
{"text":"Ordered a white shrimp for appetizer and a T-Bone for dinner. The shrimps were fresh. The T-Bone was precisely done as requested. The service was good, the waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Had steak with a friend at this place and the steak was excellent.  Cooked perfectly as a lot of places usually overcook my medium rare.  Service was fast and courteous.  Definitely recommend this place because they have good prices and great food and service."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, in comparison to the Keg the price is lower overall, but steak price is not that different. The service is great."}
{"text":"They over cooked my steak, and my parent's steaks seem really dry as well. Seems like they left it out for hours before serving it to us. The only thing I really like is their lobster bisque soup."}
{"text":"Possibly a 3 star, it's all credit to the waitress.  Within an hour of opening the door for the day, they already sold out of the clams? They should use a better excuse.  The oysters came on top of a huge pile of ice. Funny thing is they give me two small fork in different size, do they expect me to share? If so, why the fork in different size? Is it just me or they should disconnect the oyster from the shell so the people can just slurp it? It's not that hard for me to pry it off the shell, but why?  The waitress kindly remind us that we can have the salad first as it's AYCE, but as we walk in I can see that I don't like the selections, why bother?  We asked her to serve us the soup, the lobster bisque comes in a metal bowl in a wooden bucket/holder(?) thingy, which gives me the impression of being dirty. The bisque itself taste like a creamy soup, no lobster meat, couple small potato cubes, and onions, so much like a chowder. (Remember, they don't have clams.)  The 8oz ribeye steak arrives, with half a red potato, 1 piece of broccoli, a half a stick of carrot, and a bunch of raw alfalfa sprout. Where to start?  The raw alfalfa sprout was so overpowering that I have to check and see if the broccoli or carrot are raw too. The carrot seems to be cooked through, but it is so hard. The broccoli is the same, the texture is like raw, but doesn't taste raw, really strange. Red potato was definitely cooked, yes, I am sure.  The steak, almost smaller than the potato, was completely without seasoning, NO SALT AT ALL. Of course that means it has no flavour what-so-ever. They put a small dish of sauce on the plate, even dipping the steak in it doesn't help, still need salt. Also, medium-rare usually means it's bloody in the middle, the outer edge being pink; the medium-rare I got was part rare, part medium. So I guess medium + rare = medium rare...  My wrist are tired as the small salt shaker makes it so hard to get some salt on to the non-seasoned steak. (Break-time for 15min.) (the vegetables are not seasoned too)  Dessert was named Day & Night deluxe dessert or something, but it's just ice-cream. (Well, what do you expect?)  Usually restaurant would serve a glass of cold water if the guest doesn't order drinks. But some how they serve hot water.  AYCE salad + soup + steak = $25+tax AYCE salad + soup + oyster(6) + steak + ice cream = $34+tax  Would not come back. Damn those commercial on Chinese tv.  One more thing, it's horrible that the plate keeps on moving on the glass table. May be the steak knife not doing it's job, but a glass table plus a moving plate, worst idea ever!!!!   Please ignore the decor, music in the background, table being way to close to each other, way too dark as a restaurant (or anything)...  I would come back because of the waitress, but I would suggest another place when someone is buying me dinner."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and came here for a nice pre-celebration dinner for Father's Day. The ambiance and setting of the restaurant is fantastic. The restaurant dimmed the light and only used candle lights after 10pm. Right in front of the entrance is a large glass display of wine. A large section of the restaurant at the side showcases the preparation of oyster and shell-fish. Though, at the table I'm not sure why there there is a glass case embedded inside the table with display of keychains and a photo. The restaurant plays classy jazz music at the background.  From the get go, we were offered fresh baked bread with crispy crust. Then, we ordered a set Groupon menu with White Shrimp, Smoked Salmon and Duck as appetizer. The appetizer is refreshing when the shrimp is served with salsa sauce. After, I had organic mixed green salad that comes with alfalfa sprout. I was surprised how fast the service is as our dishes just keep coming in.  After, we had our lobster bisque soup that has potato inside. The soup is quite salty but that is okay in order to be prepared for my lamb shank dish. The portion is perfect! If I can order a glass of red wine, I would! (I was sick that day).  I must say that the service was very good. The server was quick to clear out our dishes, give us fresh utensils and cleans the table from bread crumbs."}
{"text":"orse service ever!!! The night started out great, however then the server told us that oysters were a dollar each after 9pm. After hearing this, my friends and I confirmed once again if it is seriously a dollar each. Since it was a good deal, we decided to order 3 and a half dozen. When the bill came, they charged us two dollars each for the oysters. Seeing this, we asked the server to come over, which he denies that he ever said it was a dollar each for the oysters. Asked to see the manager, the manager William refused to do anything about it. Gave us excuses that it was miscommunications and the cost to bring in the oysters is too high to give us as a dollar each. Highly recommend other reviewers to go to this place, if they want to be treated badly and eat over-priced food. Server name: We. Manager name: William.  P.S. the manager decided to bad mouth to other customers that it was our fault while we were still there, thinking that we did not understand mandarin or cantonese."}
{"text":"I should have known better....Believe the reviews.  Our reservation was for 6pm for a party of 2 (Groupon deal). We were seated promptly. And ordered within 3 mins.   Our waitress was obviously new, because she knew nothing. She had to ask the manager for EVERYTHING!  Half an hour later, we notice a table seated 15 mins after us got their appetizer. That was it! I mentioned to the manager that the guests seated 5 mins ago got their shrimp app, and immediately he apologized. Our app was served the next minute.   Everything came out thereafter, in a timely fashion. The food was hit or miss.   Shrimp app with salad: 1/5 - not worth mentioning.   Foie gras +  salad: 3/5 - not bad. Portion was just right.   Lobster bisque: 3/5 - I found 9 chucks of lobster, which was a nice surprise!  Rack of lamb: 4/5- tasted good... but very hard to cut. Would have been better if the rack of lamb served already cut.  Dessert: 2/5 - \"ice cream on top of pastry\" is what the waitress called it. But at this point, we were there wayyy too long to wait another 15 mins for dessert. We asked if we could just have ice cream without the pastry. Again, our waitress had to ask the manager!    Needless to say, never again.  Not even with the Groupon. The service is just too slow. Food is just ok."}
{"text":"Came to Day & Night for Peter Jai's birthday celebration.  It is a Chinese-owned Steakhouse that gets quite a few whispers in our community.  We were a party of 16 and ended up having what appeared to be the \"party room\" exclusively to ourselves which was nice.  The decor is neither here nor there - wooden tables with a glass viewing pane with random scattered pebbles and keychains of guns, and hearts scattered within.  They have various set menus available starting at $29.99.  I opted for the $32.99 set menu which included: AYCE at the salad bar, choice of soup (2 options), choice of appetizer (3 options), choice of steak (5-6 options?) and ice cream for dessert.  I ended up ordering their Lobster Soup, Foie Gras, and 8 oz Ribeye (medium-rare). We also ended up ordering 300 oysters ($138 for 100).  The salad bar is not extensive but then again you don't really want to load up on salad do you?  At the salad bar you will find items like Caesar Salad, canned peaches, canned mandarins, corn, mixed fruit salad, potato salad, soba noodles, baby corn, and Jell-o (yes folks, randomn Jell-o!).   They definitely need to hire a faster shucker as after we ordered our 2 bottles of red wine (Wolf Blass Yellow Label and Jacob's Creek) there were still no oysters in sight.   I was prematurely excited when we were served warm bread baskets... but that dissipated immediately.  First no-no, where is the butter?  Second no-no  - I could seriously hurt someone with these dinner rolls that were hard as rocks!   We were kept waiting for a rather long time after our wine was brought and everyone was relatively hungry (seeing as it was 9:45PM). The oysters themselves came in 2 varieties I believe, although you got me when it comes to which varieties they were.  One was much rounder in shape, while the other was more oblong.  They were served up with lemon wedges and horseradish, and upon request, some Tabasco Sauce.  I am no oyster connoisseur but I think that the shucker dug the shucking tool into some of the oysters which to me screams amateur!  Obviously our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, as we all tapped out after 264 oysters (or 16.5 oysters each), and ended up leaving 32 perfectly good oysters untouched.  I couldn't help but think about the starving children of third world countries and how wasteful we were being!  We did try to tell them to reduce the order to 200 when everyone was looking a little gluttonous, but unfortunately, they had already shucked all 300.    I am glad that they didn't try to pass off the soup as a Lobster Bisque because this soup was basically just a thick roux with some lobster seasoning and potatoes in it.  Lobster chunks were MIA.    The Foie Gras was probably the highlight of the evening as it was perfectly seared to melt in your mouth.  The sweetness of the gherkin as well as the butter they used on the crostini served as good enhancers.  The alfalfa sprouts did nothing for the dish neither from a taste nor presentation perspective.    I ordered ribeye as that is always my go-to cut of beef for tenderness.  I asked for my steak medium-rare and it came as such.  However, I still found my steak to be a bit on the tough side.  Boyfriend ordered a sirloin and I found his to be a superior steak to mine.  Day & Night prides itself in serving Certified Angus Beef, however, that still didn't save the piece of mediocre steak I was served.  The steak came with gravy on the side, 1 floret of steamed broccoli, 1 slice of carrot and 1 slice of potato.  What a sad cast of sides!  The ice cream flavours available were: Mango, Sesame, Green Tea and Coffee.  I tried all but sesame.  The mango flavour tasted quite authentic and not artificially flavoured and definitely had mango flavour; the coffee ice cream had a strong coffee flavour and the green tea ice cream was of good quality.  Verdict:  Our server was great.  He really busted his balls to serve our party of 16 and at the end of the night we gave him a $150+ tip.  Our bill came to about  $1,276 before tip and we ended up paying $1,500 all in. I had brought a homemade Hazelnut Mousse Cake with Chocolate Ganache and Alex had bought a Tiramisu cake.  The server was nice enough to bring out the cakes, one at a time, and then a dessert on the house for the birthday boy.  Suffice it to say, we serenaded Peter Jai with 3 different versions of Happy Birthday (English, Cantonese and Mandarin).  If you like patios, one can be found here.  The Foie Gras, Ice Cream, and this particular server are what would make me even consider coming back.  I don't frequent steakhouses often, in fact, probably only twice a year.  So when I do go to a steakhouse, I will want to go all out.  With that said, I will definitely not be coming to Day & Night.  The restaurant is correctly named, as the discrepancy in terms of quality of service versus the quality of food is really as different as Day & Night."}
{"text":"I came here over a year ago with my parents. The outside and interior decor was almost a turn off and looked sketchy.  It was like a seafood restaurant turned crazy. It was supposed to be a steakplace.   But i have to say, give it a chance. This was best steak i've ever had,and I'm not a fan of red meats.  And they make a big deal of telling you it's Certified Angus Beef, just in case you forget.  My parents actually really liked it."}
{"text":"I debated a little whether I should post a review, but I figured a moderate negative review may effect positive changes, or at worse prepare diners' expectations.   Usually the first instinct is correct. There was something definitely off with just the location when we first pulled into the parking lot. Dark, creepy and potential place for a mugging or robbery. Yes, really!   I was shocked to see that this was a Chinese operated restaurant, but should have realized I was up in Hong Kong of Toronto land. I was hoping to be delighted by old school Chinese fusion (think more like One of a Kind and less Susur Lee). I was disappointed.   The shrimp cocktail was the starter and set the theme for the rest of the meal. I was not Impressed; especially, given the prices charged. The shrimps were marginally better than what you would buy in bulk at Costco, but not as good as the shrimp cocktail plater at Longo's.  The shrimps weren't the size representative of the price, but was alright.   The fois gras, lacked flavour.  Thankfully the toasted bread that served as its \"bed\"  was seasoned. Then, there was the salad. Uninspiring. Considering a garden salad is tough to mess up, they were able to provide zest and life to such a simple serving.   We had the lobster bisque next. There was an abundance of potatoes. There was not one baby scrap of lobster meat. The broth was thickened artificially with potato starch - would be my guess (as I'm sure the chef wouldn't have use corn starch as that would have clashed ) .   We added oysters to the set meal just because. I'm not a fan of oysters, and I was not swayed by the selection.   Then came the main course. The steak was done just right (perfect pink in the core for my medium), but was a shocking disappointment. It looked fried, but lacked the zing of the heat. Furthermore, it lacked flavour; especially, if it was Angus. The garnishing was an utter disappointment. One little unflavoured baby crown of broccoli - really? I can tolerate Ruth Chris wanting to charge extra, at least I know either I'm not eating it or I'm too cheap to order it, but here? Fail! I didn't even touch the potato as my partner in crime said to avoid as it was horrible.   Next was the grand finale - the surprise  dessert. Was it ever a surprise. I tell you, the last time I had canned peach as a dessert was when I was a lazy university student who didn't have a wife to prepare me a fruit platter after dinner. Canned peach (singular) was the signature topping complement with whipped cream and a leaf of mint which went untouched. This was all on a bed of green tea pudding. It was an absolute dissatisfaction! The crappy ice cream served at the Mandarin was far better flavoured! The after taste was down right repulsive.   When I first skimmed through the menu I had a complete open mind and attitude and figured I'd return with the rest of my picky family to try the other neat courses which I can't get to alone today. After the meal, I fear to return, and will take them to Hy's. Perhaps that's the problem! I was at Hy's for a juicy steak with a kaleidoscope of flavours for lunch just two days earlier."}
{"text":"Service is on point i love the oysters! half price oysters on monday and tuesdays. amazing all around!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night and I'm so glad we did! This restaurant seems more casual from the other location.  Inside is decorated very uniquely. I wanted to sit under the tree and luckily that's where we got seated. The menu has lots of seafood and steak. We went with the shrimp set menu after we had a dozen oysters. The food was excellent. Presentation was excellent. Service was excellent. Michael came over and introduced himself to us. Very nice personal touch.  I saw a long door that opens up for a patio. I'd love to come back when it's hotter outside.  Two shrimp set menus, (garlic shrimp, salad, soup, entree, & dessert), a dozen oysters, 3 beers, 2 shots & 2 martinis came to $200 with tax.  I'd gladly return. We had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese run steakhouse which was run very efficiently.  I bought a groupon for $83.00 for 2 people.  The menu consisted of shrimp appetizer, salad with foie gras, freshly baked bread, and your choice of entrée.  We ordered the lamb and the striploin for our entrees.  For dessert, we had a mango and ice cream stuffed in a pastry shell with mango sauce.  Everything was great, except for the foie gras which was just not my thing, it was too bitter, fat and tastes like butter heart attack gluttony.  However, if you like that, that's good for you!  The steak and lamb were surprisingly tender.  The striploin was medium rare, thick and very tender.   The lamb was cooked medium and it was just perfect.  Both entrees came with gravy and the lamb also came with a bottle of mint sauce.  The server was very attentive and spoke perfect English.  The food came fast and hot.  The ambiance inside is casual and the female washroom was fun with changing coloured lights on the ceiling and a glass bottom ocean mural for the floor.  They also have a fridge in the main dining area showcasing their vacuum sealed meats and foie gras.  If you purchase a groupon, they have a special groupon menu.   You have to pay the tax and tip, which was calculated on our bill based on 15%, 20% or 25% gratuity."}
{"text":"Went here on valentine's day and ordered their set dinner. The steak they served was definitely frozen before hand. Their dessert tasted like something from a cheap chinese bakery. The soup tasted like something from a can and the rest of the food was so bad I don't even remember it. Food was overpriced about $50 per person which is definitely not worth the food they served.  Bottom line is don't come here. ever.   I would've had a better valentine's day meal at mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Came here using the Groupon deal: two 5 course meal for $83   For a Monday evening, the place was kept quite busy. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted and seated quickly. We had a really nice and attentive server.   My 5 course meal consisted of: 1 - jumbo shrimp cocktail (1/5, shrimp was really small and not much taste) 2 - pan seared foie gras (3/5, tasted good but covered in a LOT of oil) 3 - mixed organic green salad (3/5, regular greens served with foie gras) 4 - lobster chowder (5/5, really thick and flavourful) 5 - Angus strip loin (4/5, it was a good amount, but my piece in particular had a lot of fat)  In addition to the deal, we had ordered 6 oysters for 10$, with their half price oyster specials on Mondays.  Overall, the best experience that I had as my first time here was the service. That extra star was definitely for the service. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Compared to the other Day & Night Restaurant, this one seems more for families with children. It has a treasure island/pirate cove kind of feel to it. Apparently the female washroom has a glass floor with very interesting decorations underneath. The male washroom however was just normal. The food was decent, and very simple and classic. But they're selection of fresh seafood is on par with the other location. Come here for their oysters! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was on point. Very friendly, prompt and welcoming service. The interior decor was a bit confusing. From a wharf, rainforest, to a swank lounge - Day & Night offers a unique local experience. Ambient Jazz music throughout the evening. If you plan on purchasing the GroupON deal, be prepared to pay an additional $20-30 in gratuities (tip). Mixed age range. Recommend for couples and small group dining.  Have a good time."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday night with my family to celebrate Father's Day. Overall a very cozy and satisfying experience! We came here for the groupon deal for $69 each that includes the fois gras as appetizer and lobster chowder. The main course includes the rack of lamb and I got it medium well.   I gotta say the service is great! Very prompt and attentive. The fois gras was done in three ways: pan seared, cold cut and dessert and all three tasted very nice! The rack of lamb was okay, just standard.   All in all a good deal, I liked the fois gras, but the rack of lamb is just average. Still worth the price."}
{"text":"I went here for a friends b-day din. Menus start at $29.99. I got a $32.99 set menu consisting of: ayce salad bar, lobster bisque, 6 oysters , 8oz  sirloin medium rare & coffee ice cream.  Oysters are $138 for 100.  Salad bar has caesar salad,  canned fruits, corn, fruit salad, tater salad, soba noodles, & mini corn.    Oysters made their way to the table at a lazy pace, they need to hire a faster shell shucker or at least have 2 normal ones.   Dinner rolls were freshly made though their crust was hard & unpleasant to bite through to the tender interior.    Lobster Bisque was bisque-like but was just thickened with flour & had pseudo lobster flavoring with taters sans actual lobster.   The 6 shells I ordered were smaller than the platter oysters the group purchased but I found them to taste significantly better because they were infantile, more tender & the juices simply went down easier,   Sirloin steak was medium rare as I had asked for, tender flavorful & consistent throughout. There was gravy on the side, 1 chunk of steamed broccoli, 1 chunk of carrot &1 half of a potato.  Lackluster sides but the meat sauce made it all better!   Ice cream flavours available: Mango, Sesame, Green Tea & Coffee. My favorite was their Green Tea ice cream because it was of high quality & tasted authentic.    Overall most of the food was just OK, BUT I really liked my steak! However, what stood out was the capability of our server who moved swiftly & was very considerate. More impressive was that he was able to perform the aforementioned even with such a large group to serve. This server was the deciding factor of whether or not I would return.   I will return some day."}
{"text":"Day & Night is a cute, decorative steakhouse that's quite a hidden upscale gem in this neighborhood.  Their ingredients are a fresh, and certified as they come.  With the angus stamp on almost every dishwear, and cutlery, their mandate is all about quality, and flavor. They've had this fixed menu rangning from $33-$60 which includes, appetizer, house salad, soup, entree, and dessert.   Appetizer: foie grass on a crostini (much like a pate), smoked salmon topped with a caper/ dill, smoked duck with carmelized raisin, and glazed orange peel. 5/5 wow!! diversification of flavs indeed! and beautifly presented.  House Salad: arugula greens, mixed with alfalfa, and fresh cute veggies, drizzled with a light zesty dressing.  Soup: Onion Soup: light, with fresh crunchy onions in the soup, perfect balance of flavors, and not over powering. OR Lobster Bisc soup: heavy, creamy, rich, almost chowder-like, topped with some thick potatoes.....per bliss  5/5 * **I ended up having both soups, as the waiter made a mistake....so DOUBLE YAAY!!  Entree: 8oz Angus steak, Medium!! oh man, you know when its angus certified, you can taste the difference!!! speechless, unable to comment how perfectly it was cooked!!!  New Zealand Lamb!! cooked to perfecftion, medium, easy to eat!!! adding the mint sauce created well diversified flavor 5/5  Cheesecake:  beautiful presentation, great balance of sweetness, and from the small serving of fruits on the side.... 4/5.....   Overall the service was a perfect 5!!!! the waiter helped us with recommendations...."}
{"text":"I am sincerely disappointed in day and night . I would NOT recommend any one of you to go here .  The Service was very poor ! We got a bad steak which was mushy when chewed . It was not a steak taste . I believe the steak was either an old cow or was kept for a very very very long time in the fridge . We told our waiter and he claims \" that all their meat is fresh\" ( well if that was the case , what did I eat :@)  He did not do anything but stand there continuing to tell us that the steak was fresh and that theres a lot of customer. He left .  My mom compared her plate to mine , and we were certain it was bad.   He didn't even go to the chef to tell him of the incident . And keep in mind that the steak was our main course and we didn't end up eating .  Therefore we paid $50 in total ( for two person) for a non eaten plate of steak  After we asked for the bill at 8:24 we got it at 8:32 pm  Yes , asking for a bill within a small little restaurant takes 8 minute . He forgot about us . There was one server serving 10 tables -.- . If he can't handle serving 10 tables then don't ! It's not fair to the customers.  Also he brought in our steak to the chef to look at when we asked for the bill . ( that is useless )  My mother was furious it took so long for us to get a bill, we got a bad steak ( the meat tasted worse than McDonald burgers's meat )  I can't deny their soup and Salad tasted Okay , but if the main course isn't good , it's useless !  I was sincerely unsatisfied !!! I am trying to warn you, so you will not go through the same experience as I did .  Good luck !  Ps this is my opinion for the steak . I am not sure on the seafood . But I know for a fact the service will be the Same."}
{"text":"I hardly ever review, but I found I really had to for this occasion...  The price is ridiculous. The Groupon price we paid for is no different from the original menu price another member of my party ordered from. Exact same thing on both menus offered, but the groupon price was dramatically inflated to make it seem like a bargain. What a huge rip-off.  The food was not good. 5 course? More like 3 and a half. Tiny portions for the value. The lobster soup tasted bland. The sirloin was cooked well but was extremely bland! The sauce provided with the steak was bland as well, did nothing to add flavor. I honestly was about to throw-up near the end and had to spit out the last bit food into a napkin. The rack of Lamb that the person without the Groupon ordered had turned out great. The dessert was practically nonexistent for all of us. Just a cheap tiny piece of pudding attached to a bit of cake about 2 inches wide and 1 cm thick. With a cheap 1 inch piece of banana cake cube. That shouldn't even be called a dessert. Such a massive disappointment and such a rip-off.  The restaurant's atmosphere was not that great. Pretty cheap looking place with cheap looking serving plates and such, and extremely crammed together. The person sitting behind my friend would keep bumping his chair into us because there was hardly any space to move around. The only positive thing was the nice waiter. Overall, very disappointed. Would never recommend as the prices are ridiculous, I would rather go to a high end restaurant and pay the same price or more for the same food but made way better.   They need to improve on everything. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon,  so we decided to go for a nice steak dinner.   The restaurant offers a set menu for Groupon customers with limited choices. The hot crispy bread served is by far ghe best i have ever eaten.   For appetizers we chose the shrimp set which included two decent sized shrimps, smoked salmon and smoked duck. I wanted only shrimp and they obliged by giving a platter of 6 shrimps which were succulent and fresh. The sauce was very little and I wish they added more as I like my food a tad bit spicy.   The lobster bisque had chunks of lobster meat but the taste was very \"okay\".   For the main course,  we ordered steaks which were cooked just the way I asked but lacked seasoning. The au jus which is usually just broth, was loaded with cornstarch.     They presentation for dessert was beautiful and the taste was good.   For appetizers,  I would give a 5 star rating,  soup a 2 star and main course would get 3 stars.   With the Groupon deal, it was good value for money but I would never pay the full rate cause at those prices, I could go to a highly reputed steak house that serves well seasoned food. Service was excellent,  wish could write the same about the main course"}
{"text":"3.5* Updated review. Three years later, I'm back. And I noticed, they've changed the decor. Its slightly sleeker, salad bar is gone, and it is now replaced with an oyster bar.   Their set menu is awesome. $38 gives you soup, salad, 6 oysters on ice, your choice of 8 oz steak, followed by dessert. Pretty good value, everything tasted pretty good. I loved the toasty bread and churned butter to start. It was delicious. I did take off 0.5* because they under cooked all our steaks. The medium rare came out rare, we had to send them back twice before they got it right. This bothers me because shouldn't a steakhouse cook steak all the time? Unacceptable. Having said that, once they got it tight, it tasted great.  Service was friendly and prompt, great family style steak place with good good and good value."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with Groupon purchase on 5 Course Dinner at the 16th Ave location with my family sometimes at Jan 2014. So I gave a try on the \"Oysters, Foi Gras and Desert or Wine for 2\" at the Steeles location. The waitress had tried her best to serve, but sorry, she is clueless. I purchased the groupon at $38 for $78 value, yet, there is no way the food on the table worth $78 dollars. A dozen same kind of Oysters for 2 people, the waitress had no clue of the name about the ones on the plate. She thought it would be at least 2 or 3 different kinds like we thought ! ended up they are all Fanny Bay oysters, so they gave us 2 Kumamoto Oysters to make it up. The Foi Gras was a joke ! I would just bought it off from any super market and put it on a toast myself.  As soon as we figured the Oysters for 2 is only 12 in total (yes, I was a bit naive to hope 12 for each of us), I ordered a dinner set, Lobster Tail & Steak (approx. $50). The Lobster Tail is like rubber ! Steak is really the only food was ok for that night. I honestly suggest Day and Night only serve the steak and stay away from eveything else. Even their lobster soup, clearly is Canned soup."}
{"text":"Been to both location on Steeles Ave and HWY7. Not sure if they are owned by the same owner but they are quit different. Hwy 7 location is better in decor and, only in decor in my opinion.  Steeles location has better service and better food; however my last visit to the Steeles location wasn't bad but not a prefect one either.   Receptionist : 5/5  It was not until the last minute that I remember to make a reservation for Father's day and no surprise that all the restaurants that I called are fully booked till 9pm.   When I tried to call Day and Night, the gentleman actually took my reservation, very nice of him.   And I noticed that shortly after we sat the restaurant was packed. Appreciated!    Food: 3/5 There were 8 of us, 5 adults and 3 kids. We ordered 5 lobster sets and two of the special on Father's Day for the three kids to share.  Everything was great until the lobsters were served.  I used to love the grill lobster here, and this is the reason why I brought my family, but all the lobsters were very watery and got a really strong bitter/ sour after taste. I had to wash down the taste with champagne.  All the other family members felt the same.  As for the steaks, I always felt that they are dry outside( maybe because I asked for well done???) and lack of flavor and since I don't like gravy I had to eat plain... that was boring :P.    Service :5/5  So when my server came to check on us I informed him that the lobsters weren't very fresh.  He immediately apologized and went behind the cooking station and brought the head chef to our table.  The head chef didn't try to deny my complaint instead he apologized and said that maybe some of the lobsters they got are \" water lobsters\"?  Idk if that was the word he used. But I really don't care what his explanation was. His attitude eased my unhappiness.   He then sincerely said \" sorry\" at the end and left the table.    Another little thing that my wonderful server and chef did was that, the dessert that they served on Father's Day was different than the usual \"Napoleons\".  So I asked him whether he can change my to the Napoleons because I really enjoyed it before.  He went to the cooking station and asked the head chef and the chef said he will still serve the 7 desserts that came with the meal and give us three Napoleons dessert as complementary.  That made my night.   The bill came to $515 with a half bottle of champagne and two bottles of beer.  I left $600.   Overall, I though it was a good experience. Although lobsters were somewhat disappointing but didn't ruined my night."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, never my choice and it's just not good. Every dish is mediocre if not less and for the price it's just not worth it. If you're really craving steak you're better off just cooking one yourself at home. Also their lobster isn't fresh it's frozen."}
{"text":"Dined for Valentines Day dinner aka the busiest day of the year. Had a more or less decent experience. Made reservations but upon entering there was a line to the door. Gave my name to the host and my table of 2 was seated in 20 minutes from the reservation time. Along the bar at the entrances there were stacks of dirty, used drink glasses - harsh first impression but there was a definite buzz surrounding the food so considering how busy they were (3 people were trying to talk at the host all at once regarding wait times, 1 client was yelling at the owner, servers were bumping into both seated and standing guests) I was feeling very forgiving.  There was a choice between 2 fixed menus: $88 each or $230 for a couple. I ordered the former, which came with a lobster chowder soup, a spring green salad with raw scallop and abalone, and the entree for which you could select between steak, lamb chops, or salmon. I ordered the steak while my partner ordered lamb chop. For dessert, in-house made jello on a puff pastry was served. Sadly there was a seafood allergy at my table and despite being a steakhouse, no substitution would be made for any item containing seafood. The server was helpful but didn't offer to ask the head of kitchen, apologizing that it would be impossible to make any changes to any dish because it would be too complicated to arrange. He insisted that my partner with the allergy just pass it off to me.  The food: 3/5 - good amount of lobster in the chowder. Taste was hearty and appetizing. The salad, however, was unfortunately mediocre... the scallop rested well on a slice of lemon and topped with caviar, yet the abalone was rubbery, unappetizing, and so misplaced onto the salad that I had to hide it under some leaves as to not spoil my meal. Then the steak came - cooked more pink than medium rare warrants as I cut into the thicker sections and under-seasoned. I've had very lightly seasons steaks that had been properly marinated, so I take no excuses. Besides that the cut was decent and the vegetables were cooked well. Didn't end the meal with a bang, as the dessert was upsetting - store-bought taste and textures while our server really hyped up it's ingredients.  The restaurant interior made for an exciting experience, imagine a Chinese restaurant tries to recreate the Rainforest Cafe. The ladies bathroom made me laugh out loud - dark, sea-themed with a glass floor and the outline of a whale on the ceiling.  Overall neither the food or ambiance was perfect, but the experience made for good memories. The bill arrived with the server handing the machine to us directly (probably to wrap up the busy evening as soon as possible). We were agitated that he didn't say a word about a mandatory 20% service charge that was added to our bill. He let us put down the machine, study our bill, and call it out before he went straight to apologizing for charging a tip we weren't notified of. I was forgiving about it but my date was really put off.  Hoping we just caught them on a less-than-their-best as I had a fun time! Wouldn't rave about my experience but happy to have experienced a meal Day & Night at all."}
{"text":"A few years ago, my dad walked over to this restaurant to order some takeout. He doesn't like dining at restaurants. He has always been that way.  He didn't know what to order, so he asked for suggestions from staff. He ordered angus steak for all of us, which includes some potato and vegetable options. I liked how you get a little flag that indicates how the steak is cooked (for example, medium well, medium, medium rare, and so on).  The food was okay. I think that it would have been better if we didn't need to reheat it. It also had an Asian twist to it. I felt that my steak needed more flavour to it.  One of these days, I will visit the restaurant and dine there. My parents and I have not had any food there for a while.  (220)"}
{"text":"Oh Day & Night.. What a disappointment. The appetizers were great, but the steak.. Oh man. I make better steak! It wasn't overcooked.. but it was dry and tasteless.  Maybe that's how some people like their steak, but that's definitely not how I like mine :S  On top of that, I sat there wondering about a hundred times - where's my steak?! Did they forget? Is it even being cooked?  For the price, I'd say it's totally not worth it. That's why I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back on the suggestion of family. They were eager to try out the fixed menu, that they have apparently had for a while.   FOOD:  There is definitely a Chinese flavour to all of the dishes here, which makes sense given that the owners are in fact Chinese. As part of the set menu, there's a choice of appetizer, soup, entree, and dessert.   I went with the shrimp cocktail, which came with a side of marinara, and small salad consisting mostly of arugula and alfalfa sprouts. For soup, I went with the lobster bisque over the French onion soup - it was somewhat creamy and had some extra taste due to potato mixed in. Though there was a choice of Lamb and other entrees, I went with the Angus striploin. This did not blow my mind, but notably, it was fairly tender even at medium. Depending on what you are comparing it to, this place is either a bit pricey, or quite the deal.  ATMOSPHERE:   Upscale-ish. Even though it's a Steakhouse, the decor here is definitely more seaside/coastal in nature. It's a bit smokey due to all the meat being grilled, so the ventilation can be improved.      SERVICE:  Honestly, can't remember service being particularly impressive or horrible either. No complaints.  VERDICT:  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I came here almost 10 times and always happy with everything! But this time was so disappointed about the service!  I invited my friends to try this place! We have groupon deals and the first time i got the lady served us! I didn't care about she was not a good service than the other one. It's still ok! The food was less than before such as shrimp cocktail always 3 jumpo but this time just 2 small shrimp!  And IMPORTANT when she gave us the bill. She said about the Tips base on total bill not the amount after minus groupon deals.  When she gave us the machine because we used credit card to pay. She said again the tips have to press amount button. Dont press % button.  Her attitude made us feel uncomfortable!  The owner is so nice! Care about the customer!"}
{"text":"One of those Chinese owned and runned steakhouse.  They advertised serving only Certified Angus Beef. So if you go please order the steak.  The other pasta dishes are just a Chinese version of Italian food....  The set menu comes with choice of onion soup (not your usual French onion soup, just a broth with onion inside) or lobster soup (taste like something from the can, no sight of lobster meat), both taste so so..  The salad bar are set up with potato salad, marconi salad, romaine lettuce, onion, pepper and kraft type salad dressing. And there are some jello cubes, I guess that consider as desserts??  The tenderloin usually comes in size of 4 oz if it is a lunch time menu.. trust me is a really little 4 oz.. as the meat is weighted before it is cooked...  The pasta dishes tasted quite bland... with the help of Todasco.. they did improve a little.  They do have fresh lobster for dinner special when it is in season. If so the lobster does taste pretty good.  Service can be slow at times! Especially during lunch hours as sometimes there are only 1 waiter working.  They accept VISA and Mastercard"}
{"text":"I came again using another Groupon and this time it was absolutely disappointing. The Caesar salad tasted bitter, the soup only had potatoes, my steak I ordered medium rare was half medium and half rare and extremely thick. Service was not as good as before. Before our server has been very welcoming and seemed happy that we were there. This time though it seemed that he only maintained a polite manner to serve us and it was clear that he didn't enjoy his job. I gave a bit over 15% for tips this time and the waiter didn't seem thankful.  Unfortunately, I had another Groupon to use and the previous experience was repeated, except the service actually got worse. The waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about, had a worse attitude, even had the nerve to tell us how we should be tipping, we gave 15%, which was generous IMO for the service we received and she didn't even thank us and clearly presented an attitude where she thought she deserved more.   Both times when we left we received no good byes or anything from them. They just ignored us as we left.   Tldr; shit food, shit service, overpriced."}
{"text":"I actually stopped coming here a few years ago before I even started Yelp. The reason why I stopped coming was the price to quality ratio just does not match well.  I went with a few friends so I was able to try out their dishes aside from my own order.  Though the service was adequate it was not anything special for the price level. At the very least the waiter did give a recommendation which fois gras we should take: he recommended the regular one rather than the one on the specials menu. It was a better choice.   The first thing we got was a stab at their still woefully inadequate salad bar. Granted you have unlimited access to it for as little as $11 the selection is very limited. The most I took were the peaches and really salty zaru soba.   The Angus beef steak I took a bite of which was supposedly blue rare according to my friend but ended up rare was nothing really to write home about considering that such a small piece was $32 with a two small pieces of fois gras on raw oyster along with the all you can eat salad bar and soup and ice cream.   The fois gras on they are oyster was interesting but didn't seem fragrant like the good ones I had before.   As for the fois gras from the menu it was a bit better since it was prepared in a more normal style. I am glad the waiter recommended this for us. However, it was a very small sliver barely a few bites.   I took a bite of the salmon, nothing really special.  For my own main course, I got the New Zealand lamb. It was okay, but honestly I can make it at home myself by just sprinkling a few spices and throwing it in the toaster oven and end up with something that is more filling and tastes better.   They have a relatively large selection of ice cream flavors for a restaurant five I think. I chose the lychee flavor since I never had lychee ice cream before. Not to bad.   In the end I won't really recommend this place to anyone just because you won't come close to value for the money. The experience isn't something special."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this restaurant and this was our first time. Steve was a very attentive waiter. Food was great. It is worth a trip to the women's washroom."}
