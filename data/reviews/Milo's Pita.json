{"text":"Just ate here today. Food was very fresh and very tasty. I had the Beef Kafta and did not want rice. I got to choose which salads I wanted. I'm not sure if it was the owner but you can tell he takes a lot of pride in his food. Plating was done perfectly and it tasted as good as it looked. Would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I love everything on this menu. It tastes absolutely delicious. Best food in the city for sure. I miss the old morning guy with glasses who used to work there. He was SO cute omg :("}
{"text":"Great food! It takes awhile to get the food but that's because it's all prepared fresh. It's worth the wait and the staff is really friendly

I had the chicken Caesar salad and it was to die for or at the very least to kill for"}
{"text":"Although slightly above average on taste (the falafel is still not as moist as chewy as Moaz), it does not fare up to the cost of $7.50 with tax for a falafel with tabbouleh and hummus. It's chickpeas for crying out loud !

Milo is super sweet and I'm sure the food court rent is atrociously high so I'd rather give him money than some corporation but price will keep me from being a regular."}
{"text":"Let me just start my by saying that I made a yelp account for the SOLE PURPOSE of writing this review. 
I have never seen a place with such disregard for costumer service before.

I was on my break and decided to try it out. I ordered a grilled chicken platter that came with grilled chicken and a cucumber tomato salad. I waited for my food for a while, which was fine since they were cooking the chicken. 
My chicken came up and the guy gave me a choice between two salads (not one the cucumber and tomato salad) I didn't like either so I asked about the cucumber and tomato salad and he said they were out but that he could make some, by this time my lunch break was running out so I really didn't want to wait I explained that I didn't have much time and that I wasn't told by the girl at the cash that they were out of it so if I could just get a refund 
He told me he couldn't since he had already cooked the chicken but that it wouldn't take long to make the salad so I waited
He came back with just tomatoes cut up.... 
So I again said that wasn't what I wanted and that I'd like a refund but he told me again that wasn't possible, I asked to speak with a manager and he said that was him and that he owned the place
He put the chicken in the take out container with the tomatoes and told me that next time, I didn't have to order from his store. 
To which I said maybe next time his employers should let their costumers know if they don't have something in the menu. I started to walk away and he kept yelling after me saying he made me a \"beautiful salad\" 

It was a terrible experience. I paid $10 for a grilled chicken and tomatoes.....
If I had more time on my break I would've made a bigger deal of it and made him refund my order. How can you charge someone and not give them what it says their meal comes with??"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers of Toronto!

I'm just in town for a few days, but staying nearby. I went to Milo's on the advice of the great people who came before me to review the place, and I'm happy I did - food was delicious, fresh, and served up quick for a reasonable price. 

The only problem was that I had to choose between the tomato & cucumber salad and the cabbage slaw to go with my chicken schwarma plate (which comes with hummus, pita, garlic sauce, and pickled veggies). I went tomato & cucumber - highly tasty.

This is a no-brainer for any wanderer passing through downtown Toronto in need of a schwarma hit."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Lebanese fast food restaurant in Toronto. I usually get their chicken kabab platter, which is 1 perfectly juicy chicken skewer with rice and humous and garlic sauce (in arabic toum), and a choice of one of their lebanese salads - a cabbage salad or fatoush. I've also had their chicken shawarmas, falafels and  tabouleh, and they're all very authentic, and taste exactly how they should! It is really hard to find good Lebanese salads in Toronto, but Milos got it right, their tabouleh and cabbage salad taste exactly like my moms! I don't eat red meat, but my bf always gets their kafta kabab, and loves it. Also pretty much everything other than the salads and rice are all made to order, so it doesn't have to sit out there and then get reheated. This is not your standard middle eastern fast food joint, it is very authentic, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and enormous portion made for a quality experience.  I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and was pleasantly surprised by how much food he piled on for me.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and were nicely laid out too.  Will happily return for more in the near future."}
{"text":"I can see why people COULD have a good shwarma experience here but I unfortunately did not have the best one. 

The Good: 
-Portion size is like so big that I had to take breaks in order to finish it
-Carefully laid out veggies
-Nicely spiced chicken 

The Bad: 
-It took FOREVER. I'm not opposed to waiting for good food but when he if mid-cutting the shwarma and then just pauses for no apparent reason... not a fan! Had to run to a movie. 
-Garlic Sauce. I love it. I wish more places in Toronto used it as a go-to sauce. But it was there was so much of it that each bite had a POW and opposed to a little zing. 
-Spicy sauce was not spicy
-Pickled turnips were dry
-Extra $1.00 for a dash of taboulli on the sandwich 
-He gave me an empty bag first, and then took it back so he could put the shwarma in. Not a big deal, I just kind of wonder why. 

I guess I will have to go back because I'm surprised by all the truly positive reviewing. Perhaps this was a one off? I'm hoping so."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place has so few reviews. Guess it's the food court stigma. So far I've been there only once, but I can confirm what everybody else is saying. This place is really, really good. Everything is made from scratch and the guy does care about both the quality and the presentation side of things (you can tell it by how meticulous he is when wrapping a simple shawarma sandwich).

As far as my order went I had the shawarma platter with rice, humus, cabbage salad and pickled turnip and cucumbers on the side and it is was excellent! Steaming chicken meat right of the spit (finally properly marinated!), fresh pita and Lebanese style hummus topped with whole chickpeas and olive oil, crunchy cabbage salad... Seriously, you might easily pay twice as much for a meal like that at a restaurant and it still won't be as good. And looking at a huge line-up to Harvey's right next to the place, while I was enjoying my meal, I felt really good, in that wicked sort of way. I'm definitely coming back ."}
{"text":"Great freshly made falafel. The salads are top quality. They have poster that detail the nutritional benefits of their ingredients. It really shows they care. Excellent."}
{"text":"Milo's Pita is an oasis in the Toronto Life food court! I have been here a couple times already for a quick lunch or early dinner and they have yet to disappoint. The ingredients are fresh not dingy or lacklustre and they make falafels to order (unlike the prerolled and fried balls at other places). And their hummus is has robust garlic zip just the way I like it!

I also like the chicken shawarma sandwich with the sparkling, tangy tabouli thrown in for good measure (a 75 cent extra charge sadly but well worth it) and the chickpea salad that comes in the combo. This place is my new to go to joint for Lebanese/middle eastern fare! Prices are higher than similar joints in town but it's reflective of the quality they use in their products."}
{"text":"Was out shopping yesterday and thought I would hop into the food court for a quick lunch. I usually don't like food courts food for many reasons, however I thought Lebanese would be safer than most and I love middle eastern food. 

So choose the Chicken Shwarma plate, had extra turnip (love this stuff !), the portion was huge, could not eat it all. The gentleman serving, I think was the franchise and he was very accommodating and very friendly. 

The lunch was a just great, the chicken was not dry as most shwarma places are, it was very moist and juicy, the salads were fantastic and the garlic dip and hummus was really nice, both home made tasting. 

Worth a trip back there again. Kind of surprised of the location....unless your a regular in the area, you would never think the best shwarma in town is located here ! ....shame he can't find a place on the street."}
{"text":"Discovered Milo's Pita while attending TIFF. The food was absolutely wonderful! Freshly prepared by Milo himself. The felafels were tasty and fried to perfection; the tabouleh was lemony but not bitter and made of fresh parsley -- not couscous with a little bit of parsley; as of the hummus: delicious with the right amount of garlic. I could not wait to catch a movie at the AMC!!!"}
{"text":"Just been here once and I've been craving to go back ever since. had my fair share of shawarma restaurants around the gta. And this place really is the best I've ever had. Had the Chicken Shawarma plate. Yummy!! Can't wait to go back

I must update the rating for Milo and downgrade it to 3 - star.
The owner was once very generous and seemed happy to serve food. But the last time I went he wanted to charge extra for Tabouleh and the food was no longer as good. :( what happened Mr Milo?"}
{"text":"Love their shwarma's. Milo puts so much into the preparation of the food. Ingredients are always fresh. Even the side dishes are superb."}
{"text":"5 star deluxe falafel pitas! 

I pick one up everytime I'm in the area, and often go just for a fix.

Perfect hummus, love that the cabbage and onions are all seasoned, the tabouleh is super fresh, and the hot sauce is the best I've had in Toronto (for pitas that is). 

Unfortunately the service isn't the greatest so I gave them 4 stars. I love that the guy is obsessed with quality and wants to make each one himself but sometimes it seems like he's overwhelmed and a bit short tempered. I'm often afraid to ask for extra hot sauce. I don't mind if it's a bit slow but I do mind fearing the man that makes my food.

Also, they have really great juices but just an fyi, the price on the board for soft drinks and water does not include juice. Juice is listed w no price so it looks like they're all the same price but I think it's $2.50 or something. Still worth it for the Guava juice, my favourite, just think it should be more clear."}
{"text":"So I have developed an *insatiable craving* for the excellent Lebanese available at Milo's Pita. Everything here is made from scratch: Hummus, Falafels, Kafta Kebabs, Rice, all incredible. There is not one grain of rice left on my plate at the end of a meal. Even the juices available are authentic (\"Best\" is an Egyptian brand and very tasty). The chef and owner Milad is a very nice guy who take tremendous pride in the food he cooks. 

Where can you find these amazing Lebanese delights? Well there is the rub... Milo's Pita is to be found in the Toronto Life Square Food Court. It is the newish building on the NE corner of Yonge & Dundas. While the food court is quite clean, and the furniture is nicer than most... it is still a food court. And one accessible after taking 3 escalators. Despite the location...

I heartily recommend you head over to Milo's for a Pita."}
{"text":"I love shawarma and I never imagined that one of the best shawarmas in Toronto could be found in a food court, but it is. 

This place is great. The seasoning on the chicken is what makes it so delicious. Also the meat is always so tender and moist.

It could take a little longer than most fast food but that is because all the food is made fresh by one guy and he is very particular. Watching him make the food is fun because he is exact and always the same. 

Overall one of the best food court lunches you can get."}
{"text":"Overall a good shawarma place but I'm docking a star for two reasons:

1. The prices are too high
2. The Shawarma would be much better if the wrap was grilled"}
{"text":"Somehow my previous review got deleted!!!

The food here is delicious, all home-made by the owner.

HOWEVER, the prices are as high as in a low-budget restaurant $11-13 and the owner has become very stingy. He used to let you choose salad and give you both garlic sauce and hummus. Now it's only \"house salad\" (basically just lettuce with croutons and dressing) and one dip. 

Customer service is beyond pathetic.

I used to be a loyal customer and went there for years but never again"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. Its pretty good shawarma. As has been said, the garlic sauce is really nice. I haven't come across too many really good lebanese style shawarma's in the city. This one's pretty nice.

The main drawback to this place is the location (not really my neck of the woods) and the hours. food court schedule doesn't really cater to my shawarma craving schedule :)"}
{"text":"Shwarma is ok. The owner is ridiculous! He over charges for his food and refuses to give you hummus or tabbouleh unless you pay $1 extra for each. He also refuses to put hummus on pitas as \"it's not a sauce and you can't have both garlic and hummus\". Go a couple blocks up to Quick Tummy Time at Gerrard. Much better owners and food!"}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern places in Toronto..i luv their food especially his meats. perfect taste. i asked him where does he get his meat and he was saying that he picks the best meat in town and its the most lean..try it for yourself and you will have an amazing experience"}
{"text":"Milo's is run by a guy who considers his job the same way an Artist looks at their paintings. He is very precise on each order that he works and he insists on putting together every order himself. His passion for producing good food is admirable. The food itself is very tasty and filling. I love the chicken platter but it is usually enough food for  lunch and a half. I generally opt for a sandwich and save the platter for days I'm spoiling myself. I always keep thinking Milo's should have been one of those home in the walls that a person discovers and not in a food court. However lucky for me it is very close to where I work so a fortune outcome regardless. Well worth eating at Milo's!"}
{"text":"I've read tons about this place and I think I got a salad here when it first opened (which I remember as being great), but I figured Milo's Pita deserved a chance to fill the Mediterranean food void in my heart.

We showed up around 1 on a Thursday and there was only one person in front of me. As per all the other reviews (and first hand experience watching the guy make his food in past) the service is slowish but for good reason. I'm a big fan of how he puts the wraps together - every bite was balanced (unlike some places where you get all meat in one bite and all veg in another). Quite frankly, he's sped up quite a bit since they opened, but I still don't get why he does everything himself. The other guy just sorta stands there and does cash.

I got the falafel deluxe combo with chickpeas and veggies as my side. The wrap is pretty great, the tabbouleh is fantastic, sauces were yum and overall, the whole thing tasted great. As seems to be the trend with Mediterranean places, the hot sauce isn't that hot, simply adds some good flavor (fine by me!). I could do with a lot less hummus (the inside of the wrap was well coated), the pickles didn't really make sense though, and the turnip had a bit too much tart bite. 

I'll definitely come back, but I'll just get the pita. The combo ended up being too much food for lunch for me and at $10.75 including drink, it was a bit much for a meal with no meat."}
{"text":"Milo is a great guy. The food is not fancy but genuine, reminds me of home cooking of many cultures : the flavor of fresh food itself. Not overly dressed and seasoned to cover anything up.
Used to workout downstairs and my trainer loved this place too. Now I moved gym so I rarely come over, but the guy still remembers me! Food tastes the same as three years ago.

Tip: the pops are two dollars. Drink your water."}
{"text":"You have to get over the location, but once you do you will never go to another Lebanese (or mid east) joint again. Milo goes as far as to peel the chickpeas every day by hand. This guy is obsessed with the quality of his food and you can see it in his eyes every time he presents you with your order. 

Milo really pours his heart in to this food and it really shows. Just try not to overdose in the first week or two-- you will have non stop cravings that make you want to return every day."}
{"text":"Milo is a great guy who sells no frills pitas. It's a fast food joint meant for a quick bite on the go, so don't expect anything extravagant. Milo does a good job of using quality ingredients that are always fresh. For the price you pay, you get pretty good value."}
{"text":"WOW! I tried a chicken shawarma from here today and it was delicious!!  Great chicken, AMAZING garlic sauce, and lots of good toppings.  I hear the falafels are just as good, will have to try it next time."}
{"text":"Longest line up in the Toronto LIfe food court and I can see why.   Ordered a chicken shawarma pita with tabouli and it did not disappoint.  I agree with the other reviewers on the quality (high) and cost (relatively high, but you get what you pay for) and would add:

- Even though I really liked the pita I'd go for the shawarma platter next time as it looked even better!

- In addition to the cashier, there is only one person doing food assembly (this is Milos, I assume) and it took say 10 minutes to get through a line of 6-7 people.  I don't know whether it is normal for him to be the only person making the food but if that's the case then you need to allow some time."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time for lunch. I made a comment about how they charged for hummus and the owner started yelling at me and told me to never come back. Horrible experience and I urge people to not support this plaxce. $8:00 for a pita that isn't great in Toronto is really overpriced. The whole pita tasted like Tsiziki sauce. 

AWFUL!"}
