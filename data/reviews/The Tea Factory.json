{"text":"Such a wonderful way to end a gloomy Monday with my favourite green tea at the factory. Sip. *sigh* blissful. Lovely crowd enjoying their comfort beverages too!"}
{"text":"This is a great  tea shop in Calgary. Lovely atmosphere and delicious teas.
The list is huge and the staff is really friendly. Take a book...zip you tea and forget everything else for a while!"}
{"text":"My friends and i are looking for the best tea/coffee shops in calgary, it was our first time visiting the tea factory and this is by far the bestest, yes i said BESTEST!!! Interior is perfect, the place itself is very cozy, their green tea latte is perfect, handmade macaroons tastes awesome!! Plus their wifi connection is really good  prices are affordableand and ofcourse good service. I totally recommend this tea shop if your looking for one."}
{"text":"incredible organic teas without the terrible filters. this place blows davids tea out of the water! staff is always friendly and knowledgable. the place is clean and inviting. They even have kombucha on tap! or you can take home in growlers (Sp?). My favorite teas have been the Detox Tea, and their Tranquil Dream. Love love love this place! 10/10."}
{"text":"The tea factory is right close to my work and I always pop in for lunch. I adore it here!  I just got the iced raspberry matcha latte and it is heavenly. Refreshing,  not too sweet and will keep my energy up through the afternoon.  The gentleman working the counter is always friendly, even when he is hopping busy. 

Their sandwiches are amazing!! I think I've had them all at this point and they are all delicious.  They also have a carmel nut bar that is lovely."}
{"text":"Very contemporary design and great location. The quality of tea is a definite step up from places like David's tea or the Oolong tea house. Also, there's a good selection of tea with high quality teaware. I found the staff to be friendly and personable. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now- both times the tea lattes have been very weak and tasteless. My friend's coffee latte was delicious however, which brought this review from 2 stars up to 3. 
They do have a huge selection of teas, so if you're looking for loose leaf tea and prepared to spend top dollar, you won't be dissatisfied. 
The interior is lacking the warm, welcoming ambiance that tea shops should have. 
The service was wonderful- very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"This place is fine. The service is friendly. The d√©cor is modern and comfortable. The tea is fine. There is nothing wrong with The Tea Factory but it doesn't have the character, coziness and ambience that makes me want to frequent this place. 3 1/2 stars is what I would give it."}
{"text":"Just came by the tea factory for an evening cup of tea as we were prepping our weekend hiking plans. We tried the Oriental Beauty oolong tea which is a premium tea sourced from Taiwan, and a chocolate and pistachio macarons. Tea and macarons were pretty good although $2.25 for 1 macaron and $7.50 for a pot of tea brought up to about $14 for the night which is quite pricey for a cup of tea. What was great though is that we were the only ones here on a Friday evening at about 8pm until 1-2 other groups showed up. Easily got the couches! Overall good tea, nice atmosphere, but pricey. 4 stars overall!"}
{"text":"What a difference 18 months makes. Went in again for the second time last week.

The amount of lighting has been drastically reduced. Ahhhh that's so much better guys! :)

Silly reflective window tinting still there (? unless Im imagining things) so still feels like a mirror.

Looks like they had to remove some light bulbs to achieve this, whatever works. The place is a lot more relaxing now.

Also, I see a large cuppa is about $3.75 now. That's a little bit better pricing wise and under that owie $4 psychological price barrier. 

So better but Id be ok with no more than 3 bucks including tax for a cuppa. Same with coffee. 

Havent tried the coffee so cant comment about that.

Conclusion, nice that they made it more relaxing inside but it's still a little too much for me wallet wise, sorry!

If they had free or cheap refills on the coffee Id change my mind. Until then, A&W is my go to."}
{"text":"Ok, I can't believe I gave a tea retail my 1st five star ahead of a restaurant, hope they won't find out lol.  But seriously, where else can they improve on?

I USED to think David's Tea was all this and that but compared to the pastry goodies in here--most notably, those magnificent macarons, as well as banana bread, cookies and even more, couldn't keep track, too much going on---this is the place to really hang.  Very upscale, lots of lighting, and just shouts coziness.  

Look at the back section of single, loungy seating. Love their high ceilings.  Wifi available too.

So asked how are they different, and one simple answer:  all organic, no artificial flavouring.  Had me sold right there.  So went w/ my usual, anything blueberry for some much-needed antioxidants, I'm in like flin, and really, a nice, soft hint of it, in a soothing way.

Friendly service.

Date worthy.

Coffee available as well.

Window bar seating too."}
{"text":"OMG so many tea's ... so little time.
The Tea Factory seems relatively new, just off 4th and 17th its very bright inside, and the food looks amazing!!! The guy running it knows his teas! He has helped me select delicious teas which can be made hot or cold. They are the venue building sponsor of the Pinata Project so I have been there a lot as of late, but its fantastic every time. The only reason for the loss of a star is I cannot smell all the teas on my own but have to ask at the counter. And really I just want to smell every one but not annoy the counter staff. who so far have been very patient and helpful and suggest other teas for me to smell as well!
And do you know what goes well with tea!?!?!? MACARONS! They have those and macaron cakes to share too! And sandwiches from Sidewalk Citzen too! Support local and go try these teas!"}
{"text":"My favorite tea shop in Calgary. Beautiful trendy design, comfortable atmosphere, huge selection and excellent service. Can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"Their new blueberry matcha latte is amazing! You can definitely taste the blueberry and it's great in conjunction with the matcha. Wi-Fi works well and there are two power outlets in the back. The area is very spacious, with high ceilings and cool lighting. The chairs in the lounge area at the back are also super comfy. Overall great place to get tea, hang out, or work!"}
{"text":"Visited tonight for the second time, perfect location after doing a yoga class at Yoga Santosha. Really like the look and the feel of the business. Definitely not Starbucks or Tim Horton's. Two friendly girls working there and happy to help with my order. My friend and I sat in the nice seating area and drank our tea's. Before leaving I decided to purchase some loose-leaf tea to take home. One staff member gave me several choices and suggestions. Then she helped me pick out some loose-leaf accessories from the retail area. She was able to answer all my questions and was very friendly to chat with. She is a definite asset to the business! I will totally return when in the area, it's a great little spot right on 4th Street! Highly recommend it!"}
