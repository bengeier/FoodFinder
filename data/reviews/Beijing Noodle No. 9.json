{"text":"Least favorite restaurant in Vegas.  If you wanna pay $50 bucks for ramen, feel free to come by my house."}
{"text":"Small brightly lit spot midway through Cesar's, sort of on your way from the main entrance to the Bacchanal Buffet. Stopped in for some lunch before going to the airport, place was pretty dead for just past mid-day. Service was quick and friendly, prices are high for what you are getting but that may just be the Cesar's way of doing things. Guessing a lower end casino would have had lower prices on food. Eating partner had the beef noodle soup, standard classic, tasty with a decent amount of meat just be warned that this soup is supposed to contain a lot of fat and some tendon so there are chewy bites and bits you will spit out but that is the way it is supposed to be. I had a cold noodle dish, sorry forgetting the name, with veggies and small bits of beef. It was good healthy and refreshing, just wish for ~$20 there was a bit more. In the end a cool spot, especially if you watch the gentleman in the front pull the noodles, worth a try for a snack, but be willing to pay a bit more than I would think is reasonable."}
{"text":"After a very late Saturday night to celebrate my bestie's last night of single life [we got back to our hotel close to 7 AM and woke up at 10 AM], we were craving something greasy, warm, and asian the next day. We were staying at Caesars so we thought this would be a good stop.

First off, the restaurant is decorated with fish tanks with goldfish everywhere. It was cool at first but then it started getting trippy and then started making me nauseous and dizzy (not good for those who are hungover).

We told our waiter that we had a flight to catch so we had to make it snappy. There were 6 of us so we ordered a handful of dishes to share:

+chicken soup
+mapo tofu
+beef with broccoli
+kung pao chicken
+seafood noodles

Rice was extra so we had to order a few bowls of white rice. The dishes were nothing fancy, nothing special. The portions were not as big as a lot asian restaurants and were priced a little higher but nothing too surprising... its Las Vegas in the Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"I'm between a 3.5 to 4 stars for Beijing Noodle. The homemade noodles were delicious. I had the one with eggplant. I'm sure any of the noodle dishes would be good and it's fun to watch them make from scratch. A surprisingly great dish was the tofu with scallions. I didn't think it would be anything special but it was delicious. They put sesame oil in it. So tasty. The shrimp dumplings were just ok, wouldn't order them again. 

Decor is really cool and modern but not what I expected with a Chinese restaurant. It threw me off a little. It is expensive for what you get - you can get more authentic homemade noodles for way cheaper off the strip.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"You would think a place in Caesars Palace would be prepared. Tried to order Pot stickers and she said \"oh those take about 20 mins\" we're like ok. Then she's like \" oh we're  out of pork\".  Then she's like we're  out of that, that, and that.  Come on, it's Vegas, how do you run out. Sorry but won't be coming back here. The food I did have wasn't bad, but I couldn't order wha t I really wanted."}
{"text":"I am very picky whine it comes to Chinese cuisine. This place is very authentic.

My favorites here is the Dandan noodle (the flavor is amazing and very well made. Definitely recommend if you like spicy food)"}
{"text":"Pretty awful.  Tables were half empty yet they mandated 15 min wait time.  I ordered mapo tofu and Dan Dan noodle. Noodles were incredibly salty and tasteless. $6 Dan Dan from Pei Wei is 10x better.  Each dish was $16 a pop. Mapo tofu didn't even come with rice, lol. Never seen that before, that spicy dish without rice.  When I asked for just plain ol white steamed rice, it was $3.99.  But, overpriced food is nothing new, this is Vegas after all, it's supposed to be overpriced.  My problem is that these guys don't even try to deliver any semblance of quality.  Try Noodle Asia at Venetian if you want overpriced food done right.
Mapo tofu was also the worst I have tasted, no surprise there. 
Serving staffs were nice, but the hostess was very uncaring and clearly didn't want to work there. 
However, I knew this place was going to be bad based on all the poor reviews, but I'm staying at Caesars the whole week and i had per diem to burn and felt lazy last night.  Taught me a lesson why you shouldn't be lazy. 
Avoid this place unless you have absolutely no choice. It is open 24/7."}
{"text":"Far too expensive for the quality.  Yes, the fact that they are in Caesar's contributes to the prices, but the quality doesn't back the prices up."}
{"text":"Tried the Beijing Zhia Jiang pulled noodles. They were tasty and good. Clean environment. I felt the menu prices were way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles    Amazing fresh veggies    Really amazing and tasty food   Lots of veg options or will make veg    Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch during a business trip last week and was pleased with my meal and experience. I really liked the funky decor and couldn't stop looking around. It has an all white interior with orange accents including large fish tanks full of orange gold fish. the white tables have orange accents with the beautiful blown glass glasses. I wish I could have taken one home!
Now onto the food. We started with an order of spring rolls. I was starving and they were good. I really liked the spicy mustard sauce that was served with them.  I got a noodle dish - homemade noodles with eggplant - for lunch, how could I not when their specialty is home made noodles?! I was not disappointed - the noodles were delicious and the serving size was perfect.  
All and all I was pleased with my lunch experience. The service was great too."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try. Not a good idea. The tofu was silken and had absolutely no flavor or texture. The noodles were overcooked. The soup was bland (though they did remember to give hot sauce, which helped). The cabbage was the only semi saving grace. Also, it was quick and filling. Not recommended, but not terrible."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas. When I go with a group we tell the wait staff to order for us and they do a great job."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked eating at this place. First of all, the food was good! I am comparing it with what I had in Beijing and Hong Kong, so that's how I conclude. They hand pulled their own noodles, make their own dumpling skins and knife shredded their own noodles, and the qualities of the noodles are high. I don't care that it's a pricey place when the high quality is delivered.

We ordered Xiao Long Bao and Lan Zhou La Mein with Knife Shredded Noodle instead of Hand Pulled Noodle. The noodle was awesome. The noodle texture was just like what I had in Beijing. The Xiao Long Bao was awesome too, the skin was so thin and there was a lot of juice inside each of them. And each was huge too!

The service was good too. Everyone was polite and nice. And I like the fact that they don't always come asking if we are okay, as that's actually not good for us Chinese to be asked for too many times, asking too often is a gesture of rushing someone to leave instead. So if you are in a Chinese restaurant and you are not always asked whether you are doing fine, it's not because they are ignoring you, they are actually letting you to have your space, take your time to relax and chill. I do notice that they always keep an eye out for every table to see if anyone is waving their hand asking for help. So that's a good service for us already. We could actually wave anyone to come and assist us, we didn't have to wave to the same person who took our order. That's what I like in a good Chinese restaurant.

As being born and raised in Hong Kong, and have been in Beijing eating all over, I consider this place delivering high quality Beijing style noodles and Shanghai Xiao Long Bao.

After we finished our meal, we stood outside and watched the old chef making hand-pulled noodle, and watched his assistant making the knife-shredded noodle. The old chef did make the hand-pulled noodle very nicely. Nice hands and skills. We also saw another assistant chef making dumpling further inside the kitchen. We were happy with what we ate and with the experience. (we went by the previous night and watched a younger chef making hand-pulled noodle; I think the older chef's skills was way better than the younger chef, which makes sense as the older chef has more experience than the younger chef does)

We admit that the price is expensive, but again it's not something we eat every day for every meal, it's okay to pay the price to get high quality food. At least cheaper than flying to Beijing to satisfy our crave of Beijing style Knife-Shredded noodle or Hand-Pulled Noodle. Both kinds of noodles are good, I just personally like Knife-Shredded noodle more because of its shape. You can get probably something with the same name off the strip with cheaper price, but they just don't taste good or authentic (meaning not the same as what I had in Beijing) at all, then what's the point for them being cheap if they don't even taste right.

We will go back again.

Note: they offer Total Reward price ($1-2 cheaper for each item) when dining with your Total Reward card. Harrah knows how to do business. This makes me dine more at his properties more than at MGM's. I got discount dining at some other places that are in Harrah's properties, too. And they gave each of us $10 dining credit for just joining Total Reward the first time. So we had $20 free to spend on dining."}
{"text":"This little noodle bar is perfect for Vegas.  It was all about the show.  Watching the chef stretch noodles by hand made me want to eat here.  The interior of the restaurant was really cool too.  The quality of the noodles was great.  However, when I order a pork belly noodle bowl for $20, I expect more than a single piece of pork belly the size of a domino in a scrambled egg whites in a soy sauce based sauce.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I went in for lunch.

I thought the place was great. Yes the food is a little pricey but you're in Vegas, at a huge hotel. If you want cheap Asian food, get off the strip!

With that out of the way, I found the staff very friendly. The hostess talked with us about the menu prior to going in and once seated we had a couple more questions about the noodles. The waiter was patient with us and explained the spice level of the dishes we were interested in and compared it to something that we may of already had. My friend and I each ordered the Szechuan noodles (hot & cold) to split. It just so worked out that she preferred the one while I, the other. The waiter was very attentive with making sure we were okay and that we have enough water. 

The restaurant is kind of small but I liked it. You could see the cooks in the back and the guy in the front making noodles all from your table. I loved the decor with the walls, gold fish tanks, even the glasses matched the theme. The next time I go back to LV, I will definitely stop back in."}
{"text":"Goldfish-thousands of identical fish in six tanks meet you as you enter the place.  That and the color white.  The decor can knock you out; the food not so.  But if you order just one item on the menu, let it be the noodle dishes.  Slippery and chewy goodness. Broth needs more flavor but condiments are nearby.  Good to have if you're not paying(pricey) but looking at the fishes will calm you down when you pay the tab. p.s. the hostess was a hottie."}
{"text":"For the love of God, if you see this place....run.

My girlfriend and I were unfortunate victims of this restaurant.  Having just flown into Vegas from New York that morning, maybe we were jetlagged.  Maybe the brightly lighted fish tanks allured us.   But alas, the fates took us here and it ruined our entire evening.

We were walking around Caesar's Palace and saw advertisements.  \"A noodle bar?\"  It sounded quirky and interesting enough, an honestly delightful complement to all the other restaurant reservations we had made for the rest of our trip.  So we strolled in, after quickly reading a few Yelp reviews.  They weren't positive.

We had figured that perhaps some people were too harsh, and the reviews were mixed.  Well, I should have figured something was up when the person with the most check-ins for this restaurant was our hostess.   And it began.

Taking a seat, I couldn't help notice that as opposed to the normal restaurant attire of Vegas, most of the other patrons were wearing t-shirts, shorts, and swim trunks.  At 7 pm at night.  I shrugged it off, and looked towards my girlfriend who was trying to piece together the atmosphere as it was her first time in Vegas.  We trucked on and ordered.

The food arrived 5 minutes later.  Never a good sign, I've learned.  The pork buns themselves were okay..but horribly overpriced.  Our noodle dish however, left us in such disbelief that we called over the waiter. As opposed to its 22 dollar price tag, we had gotten lo-mein made with spaghetti.  In sheer disbelief, we called over the waiter as we had felt like we were massively gutted.   We had gotten a noodle dish so terrible, I would have gladly preferred to go to the local mall, and gotten food court lo mein.  

Because we're troopers, we finished the meal and reached for our check.  Still hungry, we noticed that the price tag of the meal was 50 dollars.   For a small dish of what was lo mein, badly cooked chicken, and pork buns that practically defined mediocre.

It may have ruined our evening, but don't let it ruin yours.  Please avoid this place, and find any other establishment.  ANY OTHER PLACE.  This is a waste of your time, money, and honestly, is a blackmark on a pretty great hotel.   But hey, at least they have pretty fish."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I enjoyed my meal here. I had the fried rice and fried tofu. Both dishes were excellent. My cousins who accompanied me and are picky eaters, enjoyed the meal just as much as I did. We even were tempted to go again. The fried rice was not loaded with soy sauce, but instead very flavorful. The fried tofu dish had some dry seasoning which was very tasting.

Recommendation: Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Service here is horrible. There's a lot of staff and rarely any patrons. Our main entrees came out first, and took forever for our dumplings to come. Not once did anyone come by and let us know when the dumplings were coming or why the dumplings took forever to come out. Lastly, no one ever came by to ask how everything was!!! Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is not good. Another table hot silverware in a plate. We didn't. They got peanuts while waiting. We didn't. Won't be coming back here with so many places to eat."}
{"text":"Good place, there noodles are hand made. Both: Excelence
They have dumplings, soup, hotpot, or even just a warm cup of soup. And there desserts are amazing. Many different varieties."}
{"text":"Had the seafood wonton knife-cut noodle soup and spring rolls. Very good flavor and extremely filling. Did feel a little rushed but I guess that's ok for a lunch."}
{"text":"They serve SHARK FIN SOUP! They call it the \"Seafood Special Soup\" which is code for Shark fin soup and the $100+ price tag confirms what it is. Google shark fin soup to learn how horrible a practice this is. 

Furthermore, even if you don't care that you are supporting a business that practices the endearing of animal species, then you should care that the food sucks. 

I came here with a group and only after ordering and eating did I notice the \"soup special.\" So my 1star review of the food part was for before I knew of their soup. If I could give a negative rating--- I would. 

The food was tasteless and I ordered their famous noodles, which there is only a small selection of actual noodle plates, ironic for a restaurant with \"noodle\" in the name. 

I tried many dishes from the large group order and wasn't impressed with any of them. When the bill came, the experience left an even worse taste in our mouths as we realized that they charged $4 for each dinky bowl of rice that was brought to the table...rice that we didn't ask for. 

The prices were crazy EXPENSIVE even for Las Vegas! I mean at least in Vegas if you buy food and it costs a lot you get a huge serving---not here! Servings were small to medium at most.

Oh and the service was horrible. One entree didn't show up until 15+ minutes after the rest of them. Three of us also had to leave for a show as we waited for the bill to arrive. About 15 minutes later 2 more people had to leave--- leaving 2 people to wait at the table for the bill or the waiter to come by. By the time the waiter got to the table, our group of 7 people was down to only 2 people and he hadn't noticed the mass exodus that had left the table! So, maybe 30 minutes later the bill arrived. 

The only good things were the dumplings and the lychee martini, but nothing special as I have had similar quality many times over. 

My advice...Take a pretty photo of the restaurant and their goldfish aquarium and move on..Go somewhere else, anywhere! 

Advice to restaurant; Don't be such a dick and kill of sharks and screw over your patrons with crappy food and high prices."}
{"text":"If you are in Las vegas and you don't want to drive to chinatown to eat, and you have won lots of money and want to pay too much for noodles, you might like this place.  But overall, the hand pulled noodles is just OK.  The noodle itself is good but its what goes with the noodles that is just OK.

Though the beef pancakes are good, but thats the only thing I would stop in there to eat.  Everything else I can pass on."}
{"text":"Nice fish tank, horrible service. No one acknowledge us after we sat down. It took 20 minutes to place our order after we were able flagged a waiter down. Not acceptable since it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had the shrimp pork dumpling was rotten the sea bass I order for room service was really fishy worst food ever."}
{"text":"The food was good but definitely not worth the price, although we got the meal for free, or authentic. The goldfish tanks in the front attract the many people who walk by but the walls inside seriously hurt your eyes... Bright and abstract. Service was good and food came out at a decent pace."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here dec 18 2010. And we ordered chow fun and some kind of noodle soup. Chow fun was $16 and the soup was $18. The service was bad. Not very friendly servers and also the manager staring on us while we were eating. I don't know why he was doing that. Anyway my husband said it was a waste of money paying $45 worth of food we paid. The food was not really good. And will not eat here again. We do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"First and foremost ,you have to understand that you're eating Chinese food at a casino. If you can grasp that then your dining experience expectations will be dramatically different(meaning you have to  lower your standards; it's equivalent to a weekend of heavy drinking if you were single and you're looking to settle for the night minus the walk of shame in the morning). We dined here solely because my friend (the groom) really wanted his fix of noodles and wonton. 

For those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food wasn't the best, but when you're fiending for some Chinese food and you're in the middle of the desert, expect to pay a higher price point to somewhat get that fix. However, a full satisfaction of what you're yearning for may not be fully met. Nonetheless, it may just help hold you over till you head back to you respective go to Chinese place back home. It could be worse, what if there was only a P.F. Chang's or only  mall type of a take out that was around? Bottomline, the place is serviceable to somewhat meet your fiending needs of rice or noodles."}
{"text":"Over priced , food was very blan, ordered the shrimp and egg fried rice and a really small portion of rice . Nothing special about this place ."}
{"text":"It makes me feel like back in China and have noodle in the little restaurant next door. The price is outrageous, but hey, what do you expect in Vegas. 5 star for making me feel like home. Even though it's not the best noodle I have ever had. But it is first time in my 6 years study abroad have a noodle make me feel like home. The average noodle place next home."}
{"text":"Taste is fine, I mean if you've tried the real Chinese hand pulled noodle, you will believe the taste and price are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is god awful. I rarely shell out a one star rating but this place completely deserves it. 

Firstly, the food was terrible, we ordered eight items and not one of them was good. The food was simply tasteless.

Secondly, in addition to being all around poor, it was way overpriced. One of the worst bangs for my buck that I've ever had.

The only good thing about the place were the fish tanks they have inside; those are awesome.

I have extreme difficulty understanding how anyone could even think of giving this place more than 2 stars; it was HORRIBLE.

Spend your money wisely; go somewhere else when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is below average, expensive, and a small cup of steamed rice is a $4 add on. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Not terrible but can definitely do better for the price. $6 for an iced tea? Better be made of gold. $23 for my Mongolian beef. $19 for shrimp fried rice. And the total came out to around $75 for 2 people for a mediocre lunch. No thanks."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is outstanding! I love it here. The food here tastes amazing! I was really surprised that this restaurant tasted better than I expected. Tastes just like your on a vacation to traditional Chinese restaurants. This is not your average Chinese takeout place. In fact it is a high quality, amazing, and delicious restaurant. I would suggest the tomato and egg noddle, the Lan Zhou noddle, and the Dan Dan noodle. If you come here, order something special. But the problem is that everything here is special. Come here soon!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed here. The meal was sparse. The spices were like nothing I'd ever tried (more numbing to the tongue than spicy). The goldfish in the tanks were cool. But otherwise, this was just not a good experience. Especially for Vegas, which has some of the best dining anywhere."}
{"text":"I am glad I didn't read reviews on yelp (I hear the bump up and down restaurants depending on ads).

I have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.

I am a pescetarian, so I ordered the sweet and sour fish, the fish filet with black been sauce and the white egg and shrimp fried rice, tea, and white rice (about $90)... needles to say, it was very good, and the fish was very fresh. So, my mom and I came back a second time for lunch.

My mom had the soup, same white eggs and shrimp fried rice and I had the Thai style noodle sea food (which is suppose to be just seafood and curry sauce)... when they brought the noodle it had pork! But they were nice to give us a plate without pork... it took a while, so we ended up taking it to go.

I am sure you can find great Chinese food for less with equal amount of taste, but it was convenient for us as we were staying at Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"I went there twice during my stay at Caesars. Loved the fried rice. The congee was good too, even though the late night menu thing is a bit weird given I was eating at 8 am in the morning. But it seems like the norm for Vegas. Didn't like the spicy chicken cubes because they are Americanized and not authentic. Yes it is overpriced but I understand for its location. The services are fine. They were responsive and overall I'm satisfied. I will go again during the normal time to get the normal menu, that is between 11am to 12am."}
{"text":"I'm Chinese and had huge hopes for this place after seeing the amazing assortment of spices on display and the hand pulling noodle staton. The spices are only for display. I ordered spicy noodles and requested it extra spicy, hurt me spicy, I got an inch of chili oil. I just walked out. It was bad."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and it was great. It's terrible now. Slooooow service and the food is bland."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the price at all. I've had much better food in China town for much cheaper price. Most restaurants have free refills for iced tea but not this place. We were never informed that we would be charged for refill. Only found out when the check came. We paid $80 for two bowls of noodles and iced tea. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME  OR MONEY"}
{"text":"We waited 50 minutes before got sited, the food was great and authentic, the duck fried rice is a must try. 

But it's very pricy, I'd expect more by this range of price."}
{"text":"Too pricey for the kind of food they have. Any mom and pop Chinese place makes the same dishes (maybe even better). The noodles were good other then that I will not be coming back.  PF Changs am never leaving you again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Tasteless plain food! Even water tasted like a tap water! Do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! The service was fast and friendly. A must if you like Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I've got to say, I'm surprised that the reviews aren't higher. I came with a group of co-traveling co-workers...and we were all impressed. We come to Vegas a LOT and generally avoid the strip like.the.plague. But this excursion was worth it. 

Recommended by my sister...I've never seen hand tossed noodles before. I videoed it...it's that impressive and great to see a tradition carried on.

We had...
Sauce Noodles: XO Hand Pull Noodles
Sauce Noodles: Beijing Zha Jiang Hand Pull Noodles
Pork and Chives Dumplings
BBQ Platter (Roast Duck, BBQ Pork, Cold Poached Chicken)
Stir Fried Vegetablles (Asparagus, Bok Choy, Chinese Broccoli)

The XO Noodles are spicy and made with XO (dried scallops, dried shrimp)...so if you don't love that idea, you may not love this uber Chinese dish. Though, 3/5 loved it...including me.

The poached chicken is cold...but with a hainan chicken flavor. I love hainan chicken...but if you don't like cold chicken, this may not be for you.

Everything else...EVERYTHING else...was universally LOVED by our diverse group (from LA, San Diego, Dallas, St. Louis).  The service was great. The decor was clean and modern. And the noodle pulling...amazing to watch. 

I will go again...and again...and again (even if it means dealing with the strip)."}
{"text":"Pros: for a Chinese place, the food is exceedingly good (at least the Kung pow chicken and dumplings we ordered were). The hand pulled noodles are delicious. If you enjoy hot and spicy food, this place is for you.

Cons: the service is lacking. The price is a little high, but what isn't on the Las Vegas strip?

Overall: I will defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely awful. Our party of five was told a 30 minute wait and at the 30 minute mark we could literally see them clean and reset our table from where we were standing. But it took an additional 15 minutes for them to seat us, simply because no one bothered to come get us where we stood watching the chef hand pull noodles in the front of the restaurant. There was no hostess at the front podium monitoring the situation. 

Finally seated, it took 10-15 minutes for them to fill our water glasses and take our order. They were busy-ish, so I understood to some extent. When our orders were taken, it took them about 35 minutes to check in on us again, and only then because the chef was dropping off three of our dishes from the noodle kitchen. We waited about 15 more minutes for our waitress to come back to our table with my friend's spicy chicken dish. We requested that she check on the last few dishes we were waiting on.... A curry and the dim sum that we ordered as APPETIZERS. She disappeared for 10 minutes and only came back to our table because I called out for her attention from where she loitered by the cash register. As someone who prides herself on her manners and tact, I found it extremely embarrassing that I had to go to this length to get her attention.

At this point we asked for the manager and explained why. Our waters had been empty for almost an hour. Four of us had been served entrees while the fifth waited and waited. Our appetizers never showed up. And we were never offered an apology or an explanation. The manager came over and made a laundry list of excuses. He explained that they have two kitchens... That it's hard to coordinate the dishes to come out simultaneously... That the dumplings needed time to steam... That the curry is made from scratch... All of this until I politely told him that I am an amateur home chef but I can produce a chicken curry from scratch in 30 minutes. His professional chefs should be able to do it in that time or less. 

He disappeared and then returned 5 minutes later with my friend's curry. Soon thereafter our waitress brought out the dim sum we'd ordered over an hour ago as appetizers. The manager kindly comped the food that was so late... Which was nice, but an apology from the get go would have been FAR more appreciated than the song and dance of excuses and blame he served us to begin with. He finally apologized when I pointed this out. We never got an apology from our server. 

The entire service experience was a complete and total failure. 

On the plus side, the hand pulled noodles with chicken and mushrooms were excellent, as were the BBQ buns and the spicy chicken dish (not sure of the name). 

The dumplings and the curry were bland and unseasoned. 

My one star is totally and completely for the quality of the authentic noodle dishes. Nothing else. We will not return and we will advise others not to waste their time or patience here. There are far better run authentic Chinese establishments on and around the strip."}
{"text":"The food was good. Overpriced. Soda is $4.99 and rice is $3.99. Wouldn't have minded paying except they did not have the roast pork belly on the menu which was what I really wanted"}
{"text":"The fried rice with shrimp was really good and authentic, probably one of the more authentic ones that I've had in a while.

The noodles on the other hand were quite average, not worth it's price at all. We ordered the Zhajiang noodle and beef brisket noodle.

We also order some egg plants with long beans, egg plant was good, beans just okay.

Overall it was not that bad compared to what the other reviews describe.

One plus was if there's a line they will text you when they have a table for you so you could walk around and take photos before its your turn.

Oh and things are on the more expensive side do bare in mind. I'm taking away a star because of this."}
{"text":"Our family went to this place on Christmas day, 2009.  We ordered six different dishes, some soup, some noodle, some chicken dishes.  Seafood noodle had one shrimp and one squid and one green vegi on top of noodle.  Supposed to be hand made noodle, but the texture was bad.  The food didn't have enough flavor, seasoning, it tasted like nothing. My five year old could make something like that. Some dishes was just too salty and some were just too blend.  We also had to put some soy sauce to eat the noodle.  I made a mistake going to this place without reading reviews.   The place looks fancy but food is awful. Food was also expensive compare to what you get. I've never had this awful tasting chinese food in my entire life. Just plain bad, period. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!  YUK... if I could give none star, I would....  I wonder how this place can stay in business...."}
{"text":"We were enticed by the modern decor. And also the much longer wait at the buffet in the hotel. 

The staff was unprofessional. They took a while to take the order, and then they brought out the main dishes way before our appetizers ever arrived. No one came by for a drink refill etc. 

The food itself was meh. We ordered crispy shredded beef, chicken fried rice and shrimp lo chow mein. DO NOT order the shredded beef."}
{"text":"Overpriced like every food establishment in Vegas, even compared to NYC. The server completely messed up an order for one person in our party of three. When we suggested it was the wrong dish, he insisted it was what we ordered and simply left. I asked for additional cups for tea to share with my friends and was told that they would have to charge them as separate tea, yet a party at the next table has extra cups no problem. The food was nothing different from your average Chinese run of the mill shop that American cities have in abundance (Seattle, NYC, DC, SF)."}
{"text":"Just Run when you see this restaurant, noodles were horrible,appetizers come late and worst I got a stomach pain, for one hours I was in Allien movie, Little thing was going to burst out from my stomach with noodle on the top."}
{"text":"I could see the warning signs when my friends said they wanted to eat here.  Fancy but somewhat nauseating decor (I can't explain it, but I had problems looking at the ceiling, it has some weird pattern to it). Techno music over the speakers.  

Maybe I'm spoiled by living near San Francisco and having easy access to good, cheap Chinese food.  Kung pao chicken was average at best.  The sauce for ma po tofu was kind of unusual underneath the chili and spices.  And $2 for a small bowl of rice per person? Wow.   

The one thing I didn't mind about this place were the noodles.  They had a nice texture, but unfortunately the broth was lukewarm.    

Overall, not a place I would go to again.  Honestly, Panda Express may have been a better idea."}
{"text":"Great ambiance & nice service. 3 of us shared the beef and noodles soup and chicken curry. Everything was flavorful. The meat was tender. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews, but figured I'll take a chance because of all the pretty goldfish tanks. I regret not listening to the reviews. 

Food was on the expensive side, but only mediocre. I've had better at mall food courts, but maybe this place is healthier or something. Waitstaff seemed pleasant, however seemed unknowledgable about the menu and were slow. I asked for a recommendation and the waiter just kind of struggled. Food came out irregular and slow, which was odd considering half the room was empty. My dad got the duck soup which came out first. He finished eating the soup, and then we sat and waited for everyone else's food to come out. Portions were small, no one in my family came out full. Also rice is not included on entrees? 

And the crab fiasco. My mom wanted to get the crab but we wanted to check the market price. We asked the same waiter and everyone at the table all heard $16.99. When we got the bill it was $59.99. To be fair there was a possibility that we heard the waiter wrong (plus he had an accent), but I doubt it. Looking back I was more shocked than upset, but the crab price was just a \"nice\" topping to a bad dinner and service. We felt we were deceived and now this mediocre dinner was definitely not worth it. I talked to the manager and she was quite understanding and took off some of the price of the crab. When signing the bill, she had to clean off the table so I had space to put down the bill, just to show how incompetent the waiters were. 

This place was a waste of time and money. Pleasant decor though."}
{"text":"I don't remember anything specifically about the food at this little spot tucked right off of the casino floor at Caesar's but it must have been pretty good so I have no complaints. No, I wasn't drunk.  My wife and daughter loved the goldfish tanks, guy making noodles, wall decor and the glassware.  They also enjoyed their meals : stir-fried veggies and lanzhou style beef/turnip noodle soup.  My son enjoyed the fried rice and didn't have a GI attack which is a common problem for him but he still loves the fried rice."}
{"text":"Horrible asian place...seafood stirfry noodle...it was all noodle except for one scallop and one shrimp..pathetic...save ur money go eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"I was incredibly happy to have stubbled upon this place. Great Chinese comfort food! 

Sour and spicy soup was great - lots of shrimp and seafood bits.  Makes more sense to get the large bowl to share if you've got a group of people. 
 
Beef tendon and potato stew was surprisingly very tender - though a bit on the salty side, it tastes great with white rice.

The garlic and cucumbers dish was refreshing - though one can't really mess this dish up.

Lan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodles was delicious. Tender beef and 

Big plus is that you can order dimsum items any time! (The pork buns were really good - so good I doggie bagged the rest for the plane ride home.)

Prices are slightly (okay not slightly, most defintely incredibly) inflated - well compared to NYC Chinese food prices. However it was welcoming to be able to find comfort food nearby.

Service was nice. Majority of the people were courteous and polite.  They say the wait is long (which is true) - though I'm not 100%s  sure as to why - but I suppose it is to make sure the kitchen can get the food out as fast as people order.  

If you a frequent visitor to Caesars Palace - you may want to get one of those VIP cards.  Apparently you can get 10% discount on your bill  - one of the servers was kind enough to inform us of that."}
{"text":"Good service.  I had the small pork wonton soup with egg noodles plus bbq pork buns.  The soup was nice and hot but lacked flavor.  The small home style wonton had almost no flavor (slightly stale taste, definately needed something). Wonton soup was a disappointment.  The bbq pork buns were tasty."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere and the decor, the design of the menu. What I didn't care for was the subpar quality of food and the ridiculous prices for very basic, easy to make dishes.
The front end hostesses were really cute, but in general service wasn't very friendly.
We had a party of nine, but right from the start they told us they couldn't split the check for each of us and could only do it four ways, so we had to improvise. Will probably not return."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and mediocre quality. Go to Pei Wei instead save the money and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I had stayed at Caesars Palace and wanted to dine somewhere close. I dined here twice. I had the beef brisket noodle soup, shrimp dumplings, and Hainan chicken and rice (my favorite). They were delicious. Service was excellent. Yes, it is pricey but I had expected it because of its location."}
{"text":"Not bad, not fantastic. Pricey but just fine if you need to grab a quick dinner at Caesar's. Vegetarian food wasn't too exciting though."}
{"text":"I ordered two things for take out to bring back to my room. The chicken mushroom noodles were bad and the steamed pork buns were worse. I would say the buns were borderline inedible. The service was fast enough, but it is expensive and not worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I can give no star at all - we visited this place and had to eat at night owl service because it was late and we were staying at Caesar's it was easy to go there. There was nothing on menu which was vegetarian which was shocking and when finally we ordered noodles and vegetable in schezwan   Sauce what came on the table was even more shocking. There was noodles and chili oil and bak choy. 
The meal was very very expensive for just noodles. The server asked in the end to pack the meal as I couldn't eat it because it was too spicy to put in my mouth- she said that \"Oh I thought you are Asian and can eat spicy food\". Yes, I can eat spicy food but not chili oil.
Please make sure you ask carefully what you are getting in your meal. Vegetables I understand means vegetables not just Bak choy!!!
It is a rip off place unless you have won too much money not to care....for vegetarians it is better for you to go to Earl of Sandwich place which has much better option."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cool...worth visiting just to see the setting/decor. If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn. Red 8 at the Wynn is probably the best casual asian/chinese in the casino though."}
{"text":"It's not a real noodles house. Noodle tastes like fast food restaurant, and so pricer!!$$ bad service also. Never come back!"}
{"text":"You would think that a high end casino like Caesars would have a decent Asian restaurant, especially for their valuable Asian customers.......think again! 
Even though I looked at Yelp and saw a 2 1/2 star rating, I had been here several years ago and it was pretty good. We were craving Chinese, so we thought we'd go..,....no line on a Saturday night........that should have been a sign.  There are many complaints about the price......yea it's expensive, but hey, most restaurants on the strip are. 
The issue is the food and service. We ordered pork buns for appetizer and there were small and uninspired, but not too bad. Then we waited and waited and waited. When we came in, there were only 6-8 tables filled. We watched as others, who came in long after us, being served their meals. Several complaints to our server were met with \"I'll check\". Still waiting and we asked for the manager. Young female manager came over and apologized and said it was busy and since we didn't order noodles, our meals were cooked in another kitchen. Come on? Then the table next to us, who sat down 30 minutes after us and ordered virtually the same thing, got their meals. Called the manager back. She said she'd look into it. Came back and said our server screwed up. She never bothered trying to figure it out the first time. Mistakes happen! But the our food arrived. Crispy Chicken in garlic sauce and fried rice. I've had almost as good at Panda Express. Not impressed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Okey, this is probably one of those restaurants that you should avoid during your visit in vegas. I dont actually really know how and why they still can be apart of the caesars establishment. 

They get one star for being one of few places opened right in the middle of the night. But its more or less here it ends. The menu is not too much to cheer about, and the pricing is a joke. I got some small fried pork stuff for $20 that i could have just skipped having.

If you walk by and see a lot of ppl inside, dont be fooled, they are probably just there for their first and last time, as everybody else going here!"}
{"text":"Just went to number nine last night with my lady. I man that was some good stuff I left full and still had some food to take hrome. thle estruant had a very modern feel to it. Was not ikr other spots I have been to. The menu was very vast making it hard to choose what to eat. I started with some pickeled wood ear mushrooms being a mushroom lover this salad was a good changes of pace to what is considered the norm. We shared a beef noodel soup witch was also great my son kept slurping up the hand made noodels.Witch you can watch the man make in the window to order along with the shu-mi. witch was as good as if you were in China town. Very good mela on the strip got out under a 100 dollars for three people not bad!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed by the food, but the place looks really cool!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how low the star ranking for this restaurant is considering they actually serve really good food.  My friend and I bought a groupon for $35 that was good for $50, so we decided to use it for dinner. The prices are high; it's vegas, you should expect that if you're eating on the strip that it will be expensive. 

Our waiter Chung was super helpful and attentive. Sometimes waitstaff treat you shitty when you have a groupon,  but he was happy to explain to us how it worked. 

We ordered
Steamed bbq pork buns: amazing. Sweet pork with hints of cinnamon in the bbq sauce. Three come in an order, but it's really not enough because they're so damn good.
Combo chow mein: pretty basic chow mein with chicken and beef. Freshly wok'd so the veggies were tender by still had a nice snap to them. A little under seasoned for my taste.
Mixed Bbq platter: normally it will come with duck, bbq pork, and poached chicken but Chung told us that the chicken is served cold. Most people are unaccustomed to it, so he recommended that we substituted it for more duck and pork. Such a great tip. The pork was great and the duck was a little too salty, but they complimented each other nicely.
Oolong tea: they charge per person for the hot tea, so be aware. 

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"We stopped here for some lunch on our last day in Las Vegas, and we're happy we did so. The hostess, and the two other people we'd encountered were very friendly and happy. We ordered our meals, the vegetable fried rice and the vegetable chow mein, and the were very tasty. The design of the place is very cute, and to add to that there are three large goldfish tanks that add to the fun, classy atmosphere. I'd take a picture of the meal, but it's all gone now! :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant was visually awesome.  Daughter and I ordered three dim sum dishes; steamed pork bun, shrimp on cloud and pork soup dumpling.  We enjoyed all three and two boba teas for the road. Cost of food was not too bad for location.  Casual dress seemed to be fine."}
{"text":"OMG !!!!!!!!!! I was shock this place is way toooooo expensive for nothing special food !!!!!! 

Regular noodle soup is $30 ??????????
( actual quality was $7 plus Vegas casino price should b $15 seriously !!!!!! ) 

That simple regular ramen was $30 for late nite special ..........

Small steam rice $4

Hot tea $8

Small 4pieces dim sum $15


Too expensive and 0 satisfied"}
{"text":"As a person from Lanzhou, I was very excited to try the \"Lan-Zhou style\" noodles. They were not even close to what Lanzhou noodles should be. The broth was bland, the noodles had terrible texture, and I was very disappointed. Also, the soup dumplings had a strange flavor. It was a waste of carbs, and a waste of a meal during my time in Vegas."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I'm Chinese. I love food. So this review is going to be a generally harsher review - I WILL rate this according to what actual Chinese food is like. 

1. Overpriced 
But this is Caesars Palace after all. So just go knowing that. 18 dollars averagely per plate. 

2. Food was very American Chinese. Not at all authentic.

I had a hand pulled brisket noodle. The noodles were fresh but not very spongy and a bit flat and too thick. The soup was lacking in stock and had a layer of oil on top that was unnecessary and just made the dish oily and not tasty in the right way. But I will say that the beef brisket itself was tender enough.

I also had the Pork Soup Dumpling which was decent. The Pork inside was flavourful but the Dumpling itself was too thick and lacked sophistication. 

The environment is pleasing - contemporary looking and with goldfish aquariums inside. 

3. Service 
Is not great. It's alright. But not great. We had finished our meals for 15 mins already and no one came to get out plates. 

CONCLUSION
I'm giving this 1 star for the decor and the beef brisket itself."}
{"text":"Came here to settle my stomach from something I ate earlier in the day. I chose beef with soft noodle soup. The broth was so good. One can watch the fresh noodles being made. Very cool to watch. Stop here for some fresh noodles!"}
{"text":"Omg?its so expensive and taste awful. One thing make me uphappy ,I'm not sure that we need to pay tips, but the waiter asked us to pay tips for order food to go. Stupid????"}
{"text":"This place is not the place to eat noodles. Instead, eat the meats. The noodles are overpriced for their quality. The actual soup is bland and the meat quantities are low for the price of noodles. Around 17 dollars for a large bowl of noodles and 4 pieces of meat. But what makes this restaurant 3 stars instead of 1 is the customer service, decoration, and the taste of the meat here. The customer service is completely friendly and are professional. The ambience is quite casual here and the decoration is amazing. They have glass tanks of fish and make it feel more authentic. The noodles may be bland but everything else on the menu is pretty alright. But overall, it's a okay place."}
{"text":"I went here back on November of 2015, tried to post my feedback but it didn't work so attempted a few times, same result. Today I'm trying again since it was sitting in my draft inbox. This place is overrated. I should of stick to Spring Mt Road if I wanted real authentic hot pot aka shabu shabu soup.

I wanted soup so I figured I check out Groupon of there were good deals or recommendation. Long behold this popped up. Pretty decent, value at $50 for $25. Deal! Being that it's hidden in Ceasars palace it might be good right?

Walked in, took us a few minutes to find it. Don't get wrong the place is beautiful! Tanks of gold fishes all around. So we sat down, dinner time, wasn't that busy. So I attempted to order this hot pot meat (Beef, comes with cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, spinach, hand pull noodle and clear noodle.) At first the waiter advise me he was sorry, apparently you need to rsvp that since it takes the cook longer to prep it then later nicely said we will do it for you. The soup came out scorching hot! Had the meats, veggies and super red broth. Really it's the way I like it. I put in the meat for it to cook then the veggies and here I go scooping it into the little bowl. Oh my!! The flavor! What the heck is this??? There's no flavor and super oily not to mention it's plain for the Sichuan Style which is their hottest broth. Basically paid $50 extra on top of what I paid for Groupon total of $120! Hmmm should have ate elsewhere for that much. Tired it once....no thank you. 

I do have photos of the place but that was back 2015. The place looks stunning but as for the food. It's not that good (only speaking of the soup I had). Came out unsatisfied for $120 meal. Service was okay. I felt like the waiter was more attentive if you're not Asian since they think they don't tip well."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food we have ever eaten, but definitely not the worst  

The dim sum dumplings were good.

I had the shredded duck noodle bowl which had a nice flavor.  My husband had the noodle bowl with beef and turnips this also had a good flavor.

Atmosphere is a little on the loud side."}
{"text":"Bacchanal next door was a 2 hour wait so we decided to try this place out. They made us wait 20 minutes to be seated even though there were plenty of tables open. We had to wait in between huge tanks of goldfish which had LOTS of dead and dying fish. I had to keep looking down at the ground because it was starting to disgust me. From that moment I had a bad feeling about this place. 

We were sat at a table and someone came to get our drink order. Then 3 more people proceeded to come and try to take our drink order. Obviously there was no system or communication going on there. When the drinks came, one was missing, another had two straws in it and another drink didn't have a straw. This was so dumb it was laughable. 

A waitress came to take our order and when we tried to order salt and pepper shrimp, she said they were out of shrimp so we ordered other dishes. But while trying to order the waitress would stop listening and start talking to someone else in the middle of us ordering!! To no surprise when our order came out there were things missing! Also, our noodles had shrimp which they said they were out of?! Food sucked and nobody came to check on us. We had to flag down someone to give us and the tables around us our checks. 

I don't know how this place stays open with such horrible service and tasteless food. Worst place I've ever been to in my 20 years of living in Vegas."}
{"text":"For those who wanna try the noodles here, the sauce is good, above the average, but sadly the noodle worth only one star, it claims that it was hand pulled noodles, but it's not, or pulled by a bad chef, too soft, maybe I will consider it when I am 120 years old."}
{"text":"3 stars, minus the one star penalty for serving shark fin.

Went to Beijing Noodle No. 9 with some colleagues for lunch during a conference held at Ceasar's Palace.  

Good:  BRILLIANT decor.  It's inventive, unique, and shows that you dont need to throw a bazillion dollars at decor to do something really striking.  Kudos to the design team on this place.

Bad:  Food and service was hit and miss.  My hot and sour soup was excellent; main dish, not as much.  Wait person never seemed to be around when we needed her.

Ugly:  They have shark fin on the menu.  Shame!  I took away one star on my review

My advice:  Poke your head in and admire the decor for a minute or two, then move along to Mesa Grill."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is very airy and light, a nice reprieve from the casino floor just steps away.  The food was good.  But $12 for a pot of tea, to be split by 3 people? Not so much.  Despite the insane overcharge on hot tea, my firm was at Caesar's for a convention and we pretty much ate at Beijing Noodle every day for lunch for 3 days."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Vegas, we must come to this place, but this time, after check in hotel, we came here for late night food. Food were  very salty.  We through maybe were  too late to eat we maybe taste the food salty, But we were wrong, we came for lunch today, omg wrist then last night, everything we order were very salty.  We told the waiter about food were very salty, he said that when we order should ask for less oil and salty.  Why he said that to us, we were group of 8 peoples, my Niece can ate very salty cause every time she have to have soya sauce to dip her food,  but this time she didn't have to have soya sauce and she also can taste the food very salty too.   Never ever come again. Hope the own can see my review and improve their food."}
{"text":"I expected something different from a hep looking Noodle Bar.  Here is my honest opnion - 

Cons - 

a)  Too expensive for the experience - you can get a buffet at Harrah's or even MGM for the price.
b)  Too little quantity for the price
c)  Grumpy service - slow and bordering on rude.
Pros - 

a)  Unique decor - fits in with Vegas style completely.
b)  Above average food - I had the egg and tomato hand drawn noodles - very tasty.  The fried rice was so - so.  

Go here if there are no other options or you haven't had Chinese food in a while."}
{"text":"Staff unbelievably rude ! when I asked what does one dish taste of the waitress replied I wouldn't understand because Im not asian !

great dim sum but the service is just too horrific to return - got to Sea thai at Ballys instead for great asian food and lovely staff"}
{"text":"The décor was wonderful - loved the gold fish tanks and I got to sit at the bar (even saw the chef making noodles which was great).

The reason why I only gave it 3 stars:
1. One of me and I wanted to sit at the bar - that should not take long but the hostess was a bit slow.  Once the food was ordered though, the food came fairly quickly.
2. I ordered Chicken & mushroom noodles (AWESOME), Shanghai dumplings (not good), and cucumber salad (just okay).

I would go back just for the chicken & mushroom noodles because it was really delicious but don't set high expectations for the speed of service."}
{"text":"It was alright, I can make better noodles for damn sure. Not much to say about this place. It is, what it is. 

-Atmosphere: Chill, very Modern, its Vegas! 

-Food: Good, but if you know how to boil water, i think you can do this yourself with help of a few topics from google. 

- Sanitation: Clean 5 Star 

- Service: Always good. 

- Overall: Chill experience, but I wouldn't go there again when i can do it myself."}
{"text":"If you have choices, do not ever ever come to this place for a meal, because you will regret for that if you do have anything in the place. Waiters acting like f**king cold blood animals, not even mentioning the waiting time is stupid long. Worst place ever! And they're lucky that I can't give zero star to this place, I would definitely give a zero star if I could."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! Great service and reasonably priced! Definitely going to return when back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Slow service, overpriced, lower than average food quality. Walked in, seated, waited 15 mins to get a cup of water, ordered wonton noodles and beef brisket noodles, both small portion. Noodles were plain in taste compare to most other Chinese restaurants. For the price, I expect the restaurant to be clean, but there was a fly on the table."}
{"text":"After reading all of the Yelp reviews for Beijing Noodle No. 9, we were unsure whether we should dine there, but decided to try them out anyway. To our surprise, not only was the food amazing, but the service was superb. These are the dishes we tried:
- Hand pulled thin noodle with sliced beef 
- Har gow, shrimp dumplings 
- Kung pao shrimp
- Braised sea bass in a clay pot 
- Baked BBQ pork pastry
- Jelly fish salad
- Vanilla mochi ice cream
- Fresh squeezed water melon juice

The dim sum is all freshly made to order so it requires a bit of extra waiting, but it is well worth it if you are having a leisurely meal. Their freshly made hand-pulled noodles are superb, not too soft and not too chewy. All of the waiters and waitresses provided excellent service throughout our meal, The only thing that may hinder diners is the higher prices, as the restaurant is located in the heart of Caesars Palace, otherwise I would highly recommend this excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was good with traditional Chinese noodle dishes. The menu is quite large, large enough for you to go with people who are not huge noodle fans. The dishes are a little bit expensive, even though you expect it to be a little high-priced since you're in the middle of the Strip in Las Vegas. For the amount of food we got, I'd expected the prices to be a little lower. For one, you may get one noodle dish and an appetiser to be fulfilled. For two, maybe one more noodle dish.

It was a little hard to find since Caesar's Palace is so big!

I did like that you can choose whichever kind of noodles they have for any kind of stir fry or soup style. That was a nice touch of customisation. The hand-stretched noodles were the best!! The knife-shredded noodles are a close second.

Ordered:
-Soft Tofu and Chives
-Tofu Strip Salad in Sesame Oil
-Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumpling Pork
-Shredded Duck Meat, Rice Vermicelli Soup
-Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup with knife-shredded noodles
-Tomato and Egg Sauce with hand-stretched noodles

All were quite delicious except the Beijing Pork Wonton soup. It didn't have the traditional Chinese chicken soup flavor."}
{"text":"As stated in another review this is on the Las Vegas strip and in a major casino so don't be surprised about the price.   Though I found a lot cheaper than some places around the strip.  The decor is just more futuristic so some find it strange, I found it new and makes the restaurant unique.  But one of the most important thing is the food in a restaurant.  And I did  not try anything there I didn't like.  However the service which is also important, was not horrible but it wasn't anyhing to say hooray for either."}
{"text":"I wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews, but this place looks so inviting with the hand made noodles. This was by far the most disappointing dinning experience I have had in Vegas. I paid $30 + tip for the Duck Soup and Spring Roles and was expecting high quality. The noodles were tough and knotted together, and the pieces of duck were half bone and cartilage. This was unappetizing and nearly inedible. The broth was nothing special either, and the service was awful.

The spring roles were very good, the highlight of the meal. But they were small and could not compensate for the terrible entree. 

You would be better served at a fast food Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"It looks ok but I was so surprised we still have such a public services. I requested spicy  condiments and seving lady (manager?) Gave me a  left over next table who just finished their meal and told me \"here\" we all saw each other. I understand we share some condiments like soy source but not direct customer's silver ware like spoon. This restaurant need definitely aware the public hygiene."}
{"text":"Well, I randomly came across this Noodle shop as I was wondering around into the Caesar's Palace, which is like a rat maze that is designed to never let you out. I was told that Caesar's Palace has one of the big cocktail drinks that everyone seemed to be carrying around in the street and there I got stuck in search of the damn drink. I started to get hungry and came across a bright white restaurant with ridiculous gold fish tanks. I was told that they hand roll their noodles and make their dumplings, so I convinced our party to stop by for lunch. Oof. Big mistake! We ordered the Beijing noodles, seafood noodle soup, Shanghai dumplings, and kungpao shrimp. All of them were complete misses. I am not sure if it was just us, but we completely failed on all our dishes. It might have been just a coincidence, but I think not. I think this place just sucks. It is overpriced for such a noodle shop and I have been lured in by the damn fish tanks. Damn it! And for those reviewers who gave 5 stars, what the hell did you eat? And what have you eaten all your life? Dog food?"}
{"text":"If your dear grandmama came over and cooked you a bowl of noodles, would you pay her $9 for it?  If the answer is yes, then come eat at this place.  If the answer is no, then take your $9 and put it in the nearest slot machine because at least with the slot machine there is a promise at a better life.

I had the beef brisket with homemade noodles and the beef brisket is reminiscent of the Taiwanese \"lo-bah\" that I used to love eating when my grandmama would make it for all of us grandkids......except my grandmama made it better.  The beef here was stiffer than Ted Williams after the cryo company got their hands on him and the noodles were not memorable, like all of Eddie Murphy's movies after Beverly Hills Cop.  I looked around and saw the other dishes on other tables and they looked bland.  

This wasn't a horrible place.  Just not worth what you pay for.  In Vegas, you can get much better for $9, don't waste your time here.

For uneventful noodles and eventful prices, this place gets 1 star!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere; makes you feel like you're incased in ice... almost like where superman lives!  (except with 10,000 pet goldfish!)

The three of us ordered Seafood noodles, Salt and pepper shrimp, Braised sea bass, Black pepper sauce mushrooms, and garlic/chinese parsley pork.

The shrimp in the noodles and the S&P were very large maybe U15 or so, and cooked properly. The S&P crumbs were delicious as usual. The noodles were fresh, but nothing that special. There are better noodle places around. Sea bass was too sweet, almost tasted like a dessert. The black pepper sauce is tasty on the mushrooms and the pork was tender with a light and refreshing flavor between the chinese parsley and the garlic.
Overall the food was good, but overpriced. We ate all the food and we were content and happy, however, Chinese food this expensive needs to knock me out of my seat, but it didn't. 

Also, rice is 2.09 a bowl, didn't buy any, but that is definitely minus points in my book."}
{"text":"The food was good. A bit overpriced but good.

However the service was shit! The staff acted as uf we weren't guests and they were unfriendly. Upon asking whether I could have a spoon they just threw it on the table.

It's a pity that in such a nice venue they act like they don't have to bring up their efforts anymore.

Never gonna come back."}
{"text":"Quick and easy place to eat, our waiter was very helpful. I had duck noodle soup. It was good, but it was a bit oily."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but way too expensive and service was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner because we didn't feel like searching all over for a place and we didn't feel like waiting hours for a table somewhere else. 

The ambiance was kind of cool - fish tanks everywhere and bright white features. But, the food was just okay and overpriced. Service was average. 

I felt rather indifferent about this place, can't say it was bad or anything, but cannot really recommend it either."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service and attitude here.  We had a group of eight and were ready to enjoy the evening but surly waiter and lack of service was awful.  Drinks never got refilled and no one even asked if we wanted more,  several dishes never arrived, and when we were told our waiter was on  a break, he was across the restaurant with another group.  There were at least two other large groups that arrived after we did who were served well before us.  The dumplings and   beef were great but that was not enough to save the experience"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere: big fish tanks, modern decor

Food: just had a noodle soup, good, albeit pricey for $15

Service: not great, long wait to get served, refills, etc."}
{"text":"This restaurant a 3.5, just slightly more than average. The food is delicious, you'll love it if you are craving for some authentic Chinese food. The service is good but don't expect excellence. I like the atmosphere here: casual dinning, unique interior design, hundreds of gold fishes swimming around in the front entrance where you can also watch the chef cook and make the noodles from scratch.  If you're not total rewards Diamond or above member, it's probably not worth the wait when they are busy. Overall great, good food."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! asked me to wait for 30 mins, after a long wait of 1hr they asked me wait another 1hour and also suggested us go to another restaurant.. And the reason they gave is \"technical issues\". Wish yelp allows me to give a 0.25 on review."}
{"text":"Two hour wait. Fine. Even though there was no line and empty tables inside. The decor is underwhelming. And for some reason they don't allow takeout. All the food tastes the same -- salty."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food
Pathetic Service

DO NOT EAT HERE. SAVE YOUR TIME. 2 STARS"}
{"text":"Bad service? wait for more than 45min to get the food? they use many excuses to let us wait?wait ?and wait?the food is bad?do not go????????... ?????????..."}
{"text":"We visit Caesar's Palace every few years and we usually visit Beijing Noodle No. 9. The restaurant is nicely decorated, the servers are attentive and the food is usually pretty good. But, the hostesses are terrible and they needlessly make you wait 20 or 30 minute for a table even when the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"Pricey but not compared to other restaurants on the strip.  Very busy even though earlier on a Sunday night so we had about an hour wait by the time we arrived at 530pm, but they can text when your table is ready so you can go gamble away some money to pass time.  Beautiful ambience with modern white theme and an aquarium at the entrance that make the small space bright and airy.  Salt and pepper shrimp and scallion pancakes were both delicious.  Pork belly probably one of the best things on the menu with tons of flavor without too much grease.  Beef noodle soup was just average in terms of flavor but the hand pulled noodles definite  raised it up a notch  in terms of texture. Fish congee was decent.  Service can be spotty but very fast overall. Would return."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Vegas for years now and have always wanted to try this place. Last night we finally did and both agreed that we would go back again. The hostess could work on getting some personality and they need more than 2 waiters for a busy restaurant like that and if it wasn't for those two things I would've given it a five because the food was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Automatic $3 charge per person even if you don't drink tea. $30 for a bowl of ok noodles."}
{"text":"Very Average Noodle Dishes is pretty much my comments on this place.
this review strictly is based on a singapore noodles & wonton noodle bowl, which at best was below average to average.  the noodle place inside the venetian is much better."}
{"text":"A reasonably authentic bowl of noodles and very decent soup dumplings.  It's a decent price considering where it is.  If you can hoof it to the Bellagio \"Noodles\" had better noodles, but they're not hand pulled which is Beijing Noodles claim to fame."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because a friend highly recommended it. What I forgot to ask him was what to order... I shouldve read yelp first... 

The reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the food and service. 

Service was mediocre and not friendly. The waiter was actually kind of rude. When my bf asked him a question about a food ingredient, he gave him a wise ass answer with some attitude, zero smile and was abrupt. (Minus 1 star)

LOUD. Must everyone yell in here?! My bf and I werent, the 2 couples sitting next to us werent, but why did it sound like everyone else in the restaurant was yelling? The yelling was actually the first thing we noticed when we arrived.   So bizarre. (Minus 1 star)

The food..  small portions for ridiculous prices. We had the:

Beijing Style Zha Jiang Mein: 18.09 (DO NOT ORDER THIS. I love Zha Jiang Mein, and was so excited to try theirs....but this was absolutely the worst I've ever had. It was like eating dark brown/black salt paste. Small bowl with a few tiny pieces of pork. I will eat  just about anything when it comes to food, but this was actually inedible.  We just ended up leaving it on the table after tasting it. ) (Minus 1 star.)

Beef Chow Fun 16.09 (This was ok. Tiny tiny portion of meat, like 3 small slices of beef on top a little bed of chow fun. Nothing special)

Pork and Chives Dumplings (6 pices) 11.09 (This was decent, but about as good as the ones I buy from Trader Joes and microwave for 3-4 minutes. It comes with a sauce that tastes like soy sauce, vinegar and ginger. Nothing special)

Sauteed Seasonal Vegetables (Chinese Broccoli) 15.09 (This was probably the only thing I liked, but where where all the tops of the broccoli? They gave us mostly stems! There were about 3 small broccoli tops and a handful of stems.)

Total $60.63 + 4.17 tax and 9.00 tip= $75.17 

For those of you who think people here are just complaining about the prices, I think you are missing the point. FOR WHAT YOU GET... the prices are ridiculous. (Minus 1 star)  Just because a restaurant charges a lot of money doesnt make it a great restaurant. Great restaurants have great food that you would want to eat again regardless of price. 

One good thing about this restaurant is that it is extremely clean. The fish tank, chairs, tables and floors are spotless. +1 star.

My friend (non-asian, but a foodie) said that he orders the pepper shrimp and the lobster. He says they are excellent. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items.. Until next time I guess... But for now I can only give this place 2 stars..

(btw... I am Asian and I DO know what good Chinese food is... and SF and SGV have restaurants that have wayyyyyy better authentic Chinese food than this place.)"}
{"text":"The place was modern and had a minimalist style, which was a noticeable contrast from the decor of Caesar's Palace.  My friend and I sat at the counter instead of waiting 20 minutes for a table.  

We ordered the Vegetarian Spring Roll appetizer.  It tasted fine.  Nothing special.  She really liked the sauce. 

I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup.  I originally wanted it with Egg Noodles, but that was not made in-house, so I opted for the Knife Shredded Noodles.  The soup had 3 perfectly cooked huge shrimps, 3 scallops, and some Chinese broccoli.  The broth was light.  The bowl was not that big, but was filling.  The hand made noodles were fatter and denser than I normally prefer  Overall, it was a decent dish.

My friend ordered the Beef Chow Fun.  Even though the noodles were not made there, the dish was so good!  They made it exactly the way I like it....Cantonese style (dry).  The flavors were authentic and powerful.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the beef was super tender.  This is the dish I would get if I find myself there again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The noodle dishes never disappoint.  Tried the crispy beef this time and would definitely get it again.  The staff is attentive.   The atmosphere here is great."}
{"text":"Dan dan mein (3/5)
Dan dan mein in Chinese roughly means mouth full of noodles. It was pretty much a bowl of noodles with some ground beef sprinkled on top. Underneath the noodles is a small pool of spicy chilli oil. Then you mix and toss the noodles to apply the sauce to the noodle. All in all the dish wasn't bad. The noodle tasted very fresh and the texture was springy and soft. Unfortunately most Dan Dan Meins I've had actually had more to offer than just noodle. The mix the noodle yourself concept is forgivable. It also makes you realize that before you mixed the noodles. The dish consisted strictly of plain noodles.

All in all not bad. Will barely hold you over. Like two bites of a hot dog, but oh well. Sometimes you have no option on where you eat (long story).

Pineapple fried rice (2/3)
Ham, shrimp, rice, and eggs. The pineapple was added like an afterthought,  even then I might've had 3 tiny pieces of pineapple in the whole plate. If you didn't know you've specifically ordered pineapple fried rice. You wouldn't have known the plate somehow involved pineapples. I was definitely a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"My first time I ordered congee, it was tasteless. But then I ordered the roasted duck with noodle soup and the beef soup, the beef wasn't bad. The roasted duck was pretty good. I think it's depends on what you order."}
{"text":"I was ravenous when I got off the plane at the Vegas Airport. Being starving late at night in Vegas when you need to wake up early and not break your bank is a rough place! So, when I checked into Caesar's I walked a few steps towards the palace tower, saw this joint and committed. 
I asked for the bar, which she suggested I do a table (weird) so table it was! My waiter was prompt and my food came quickly as well. The food looked like it was going to taste greasey and bland. It lived up to my expectations. The tofu was prepared okay, but this claimed vegetarian dish has a sauce that reminda me of the congealed fat when you store pot roast at a cold temperature. 
Everyone in the restaurant seemed about just enthused as me. 
Had I not been starving and had this meal not been $25 pre tip, I may have just nibbled. I would not really suggest anyone try it."}
{"text":"I want to give more stars because the Chinese food is surprisingly good and authentic. Noodles are a must try! But the service is just SO damn bad. It was an hour wait (but I saw so many empty tables). Good thing I could go waste some time and money in the casino while waiting. 

The hostesses at the front were rude and incompetent. The specific server I had was slow and rude as well. We ordered tomato egg noodles, scallion pancakes, and dumplings. We got the first two dishes and finished those and sat waiting around for the dumplings. FINALLY she came to us and told us the dumplings came apart while cooking. Okay...???????? Like wtf LOL and she expected us to just cancel the order. But we said we still wanted it, and she seemed annoyed.

Very pricey."}
{"text":"Definitely won't go again. We waited 40 minutes for their bad service, bad taste and overpriced! Ordered Beijing Zhajiang Noodle and Lanzhou Pulled Noodle. The toppings were so skimpy on the Beijing one and the noodle tastes almost plain. The broth for the Lanzhou one is also plain. At least more salt please!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place ....suck, I ordered DanDan Noodles and my husband ordered roasted duck noodles the taste just like you eating salt... it's so salted my tongue it feel burning my husband said his teeth feel funny because of the salt... TOO SALTY!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place when I went to Las Vegas this summer. Me and my sister were craving for Chinese food so we found this place through online search. The expensive price didn't suprise me, but the food was really disgusting. We tried the hand stretched noodle and the noodle soup was cold and tasteless.  2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"This place isn't cheap but it's Vegas and it's inside Caesar's Palace so my thoughts are you get what you pay for. The cool interior with the white cut out patterns and huge gold fish tank is very modern and chic. 

The food is great with hand made pulled noodles and dim sum. The chef was actually hired from China for the restaurant so it's as authentic as you can get by Vegas standards. 

As for the service I might have gotten better service being that I speak Cantonese but I'm not sure - either way I never had to ask for my tea to be refilled or anything of sorts since they came around every so often to check up on us.

Overall I'm not sure why this place has gotten such bad reviews but it's yelp and everyone is entitled to their own opinions."}
{"text":"After glancing at the ratings for Beijing Noodle Company No. 9 (BNC) it seems like writing this review is tantamount to \"piling on\". But write it I must. We've been to BNC many times (don't ask), so I feel qualified to talk about the food and service at this establishment.

In total, if you are staying at Caesar's and need a solid place to eat, BNC is a good option. But this is not a place to travel to if you have transportation and options. There are just too many quality noodle experiences to be had in this town. 

DECOR
The look of the place is captivating. It's worth stopping by to look at the design and creative use of color and space. The walls in the entire space are covered in white \"lace-like\" designs layered over lights and a flat white wall. The layering effect makes a relatively small space look and feel much larger than it is--there is an expansive feel that smaller spaces in casinos could only wish to have.  Even the low ceilings are covered in the deceptively inviting lace-like netting. In addition, the huge fishbowl entry way and glassed in noddle-making area add to an expansive and welcoming feel to the entire space.  

Over the years, they have failed to keep the place clean and tidy. If you glance at the floorboards and fixtures, the scuffing, layers of dust, and disrepair are all too apparent. And this beautiful minimalist/ornate design requires that it be kept in prestige condition. So even though the décor and design are a showpiece, there seems to be little concern with maintaining their appeal. 

SERVICE 
The service was solid on our last visit. We've had varying levels of service, but that is true of any location.  On a bad night, the service will be spotty: we've seen them get very busy and been forgotten by the wait staff. Even on good nights, there will be a bit of a wait for drink refills, but even then the food always comes out hot. 

FOOD
Sadly, it's bland. On our last visit, we ordered: shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, green onion pancakes, Beijing Zha Jiang with Hand Pull Noodle, General Tso's Chicken (sigh), and Ma Po Tofu. The seasoning was an issue for the two dishes I was most looking forward to:  the Beijing Zha Jiang and the tofu. Both were just bland. I would say that they were crafted to appeal to an American pallet, but I have an American palette and I was craving flavor. Salt and sweet dominated the chicken dish and the pork buns and pancakes were unnecessarily mild. The hand-pulled noodles are always fantastic, but unfortunately they do not save the dishes at BNC.  

SUMMARY
There is a promise and illusion of beauty that is never quite fulfilled. From the design to the food, BNC has the potential to be something greater than it is. I just don't think it is interested in the challenge."}
{"text":"Two words...  Tourist trap!   high price and food is mediocre.  Snap a pic of the gold fishes and move on.  :("}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. The food on the other hand was bland! I had the general Tso chicken and in my opinion PF Changs would've been better."}
{"text":"They make the noodles and the dumplings in front of you. Excellent food you can taste the freshness"}
{"text":"I took my daughter to dinner tonight beijing noodle no.9  the restaurant is beautiful and they have Hugh fish tanks with hundreds of gold fish in the entrance when we walk in the hostess greeted and seat us really fast and the server was really nice and had great knowledge of the menu and delivered are food very quickly  for appetizers we had  dumplings and soup dumpling it was delicious and the for are main course we had sirloin steak with string beans  and chew mien with beef and beautiful desert  it was really good I would definitely eat there again I give this restaurant five stars"}
{"text":"Bearing I am in Vegas, this place was perfect for someone looking to feed three young boys and have a skinny dinner.  The boys loved the fish tanks and watching cute Chinese videos. Surprisingly fight and complain free meal.  I ordered the broccoli and shrimp which was perfect. The boys shared vegetable fried rice, shrimp dumplings and spare ribs.  Everything was perfect except for ribs. Ribs are weird, look like carnitas with bone. No one liked it and my boys are not picky.  Out of here for $60 plus tip which is great for Vegas."}
{"text":"Super cutely decorated noodle shop inside Caesar's Palace. We went for lunch and had the following:

- Shrimp and pork dim sum. This was actually not too bad. It's not authentic but it was flavorful, particularly the shrimp.

- Spicy pork noodles. Not that great, noodles were nothing special and neither was the pork.

- Steamed veggies were the highlight. Great sauce!

Bottom line not horrible but not awful, clearly not authentic."}
{"text":"Came to this place at 1230am to get a midnight snack. The service seemed disorganized as one person said it would be a 15 minute wait for 2 seats when plenty of tables were open. We were about to leave when another worker said \"let's just seat them\". We thought we might as well sit & order since we didn't want to go far for food and wanted Chinese food. After sitting & ordering 1 dish of soup to split between 2 people, nothing came for 20 minutes. Others who sat and ordered started eating before us. Finally someone came up and asked if we ordered soup and we replied yes thinking it was done. He said \"let me check\" and disappeared for 10 minutes. By now we're hungry & irritated. After venting to them of their poor service, we storm out without looking back. All the waiter could do is hang his head in shame & say \"sorry\"."}
{"text":"This is always a must stop for us in Vegas. But we always order the same things.  Green onion pancakes, salt and pepper shrimp and mixed Chinese vegetables. Seriously these dishes are SO good. Maybe the bad reviews are from people ordering the wrong things. Ate here again today and again excellent! Robert was our server today and he was great!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last time in 2015 and gave low rating then. Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.

We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. 

I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. 

I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?

After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long."}
{"text":"This is a very cool themed restaurant. Wall to wall fish tanks with thousands of gold fish line the entry way. Noodles are made in front of you which is cool. If you are looking for authentic Chinese noodles than you will enjoy this. Order the chef's favorite \"spicy noodles\". That is exactly what you get, fresh noodles in spicy sauce.

Price is very cheap especially for a restaurant in Caesar's... A good snack or quick carb boost to get you back to the tables :)"}
{"text":"As a Chinese who lived in Beijing, I am very surprised to see the review of this restaurant is so bad. In my opinion,  this is one of the best Beijing noodle house in America!  Their la noodle is very good. I ate there every time I was in the Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Our buddy Bruce introduced us to this place during a convention. It was a pleasant surprise. It was a bit fancy with decor and the gold fish tank is usually a place that Laura would pause let alone a restaurant I would bring her to. But, I'm glad we did. The chicken clay pot dish was extremely tasty. If I'm stuck in the area again, I would come back."}
{"text":"No one took care of guests who were standing in the waiting line for 10 min. at midnight. 3 guests including my group gave up waiting and left. The most insulting part was the waiters made no attempt to seat us even though they saw us."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch when we were in Vegas over Thanksgiving. We got the three course lunch special @ $30/ pp. The first was a small soup, followed by pot stickers and then an entree. The soup and entree were average, potstickers were bland and uninteresting. At these pricing there are several better options on the strip! thanks"}
{"text":"I am pretty skeptical before I try this one because of its low rating in Yelp. But now I am shocked by the low rates given by many people. Yes it's a bit overpriced (but you are in Las Vegas!!), yes it's noise in the restaurant (but it's a Chinese restaurant) , and yes, the food are spicy, BUT THIS IS AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD! They must hire Chinese chef for cooking the authentic Chinese food, and the quality of food is pretty ok! American people if you think you can eat spicy food, think again, carefully. Basically they offer two types of Chinese food: Cantonese food (e.g., dim sum, and BBQ pork) which are not spicy and Sichuan food which may be too spicy for you! Ask those Chinese waitress before order :-P"}
{"text":"For Caesars, this was reasonably priced. Food was very good, and service was quick. We had to eat fast & told our waiter, who really expedited everything without making us feel rushed."}
{"text":"quirky looking place - my girl loved the fish tanks as you enter the restaurant, she didn't care for my staring at the hosts skimpy lil orange skirt walking us to the table like she's on the catwalk. once inside, geez louise, white, white and more white - what gives ? by meals end my eyes were fluttering - i found it irritating. 

cucumber w/ garlic app ( cold ) - excellent, we just had the same at china mama a few days before and Noodle #9 wins hands down ! 

Braised beef noodle soup - the meat tasted great, gf loved the noodles but the broth was lacking - kinda surprising given the beef chunks were tasty. 

Shrimp and pork fried dumplings - ehhhhh kinda dull 

mushrooms ( forgot the name of this dish - basically 3 types of mushrooms - sauteed ) - very good - probably my fav dish of the night 

gf had a dumpling dish - damn it - she ordered it in chinese so not sure which one - it's basically 2 dumplings - kinda look like crab cakes - very heavy - full of soup - burned my tongue on this one - the broth had great flavor. 

total cost - including tea, soy milk and a diet coke - $68 - whew !! my guess, it would cost about $40 on spring mountain."}
{"text":"Wow, I see all the negative reviews and I can say I must have gotten lucky on the day I had lunch at Beijing Noodle No 9.   I really enjoyed the lunch there.   I sat at the noodle bar and ordered a glass of wine.   For lunch I chose beef chow fun and enjoyed it.  Since I was an early bird getting there around 11:30 there was no crowd and no wait.

I found the restaurant to be 'authentic China tourist'.  What I mean by that is I've visited Beijing and the strange decor and service reminded me of my visit to China.  Yes, the prices are high but that's what I expect dining on the Strip.  My lunch was $30.00 including the glass of Chardonnay.

The fact rice is not included with stir fry type dishes (for lack of a better word) is very odd.  I noticed my fellow diners eating large soup bowls that looked very good.  I will return to this restaurant.  I really liked sitting at the noodle bar and watching the chef."}
{"text":"9 minutes no water, no wait staff with a I'm better than you attitude. No wonder there's no one in here. This place should close soon, Panda Express is excellent in comparison with this place."}
{"text":"We are on the strip in Caesar's Palace!! not downtown with 99 cent shrimp cocktails!! Ok try hard to find a $15 blackjack table ....win a hand..... then you can come here for a bowl of noodles! (no drinks of course) That last remaining green chip from last nights debauchery will barely get you by! This is Vegas you know!!! Ok this place is cool as one of the few noodle shops this side of Shanghai with chefs stretching their own noodles by hand!! I love to watch them pull and pull the dough then all of a sudden.....where did those noodles come from???!!! The restaurant itself looks like a futuristic music video with white decorative cut outs, bright lights, and hundreds of goldfish in large tanks. There is even a sign that says\" goldfish are not for human consumption\" !!  LOL This is a joke or there are some ghetto folks out there !!! I thought the noodles were excellent and really hit the spot.  This place is really good, expensive, and very clean. There were not even any signs of grease on the floor..... guess Its a long way from the (626) and Monterey Park !!"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  It's really pretty inside and it has tanks of goldfish (not for consumption, as it says on the sign). 

The only reason I give it two stars is that it's really overpriced for what you get and the service isn't great. They are kind of running around like their under staffed, but it wasn't super busy. 

I ordered a fried rice without looking at the price... $16.99! WTF. It was like half the portion of what you can get anywhere else. Confused... The portions are just small. The food itself is pretty good and the thai iced tea is really delicious, made fresh.

I'll come back to get a thai tea to go. =)"}
{"text":"This isn't good Chinese food in general.  Beijing No 9 dumpling is just horrible.  No taste in the meat whatsoever.  The soup within the dumpling has no taste either.  I have no idea why they claim it's the best seller.  Maybe people doesn't know what the expectations are, who knows.

The service was okay when we went, so no complaints there.

If you want great Chinese food, this isn't the place or the outrageous pricing.  This place deserves 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very poor service .  We arrived and sat .  And sat and sat .  Couples arrived behind us and they were greeted quickly and with a smile .  We sat .  The people seated after us all were of the same nationality of the waiter and he spoke to them in mandarin.  My date is Asian and after a while she chastised the waiter in Mandarin .  He gave us better service for a moment , not really .  Food was Average not tasty , bland .  Service is the worst.  Overpriced .  Don't be fooled by the goldfish .  Dilapidated with plastic furniture.  Some fast food places are nicer.  The floor is well worn and it really needs a makeover. 

Won't be back .  Sadly people will come here and eat ? Why , because it's Las Vegas and the get a new group every day .  So keep up the poor customer service .  Won't be back Ever ."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are open late and have a varied menu. It is authentic and although expensive, you are on the strip and so it is expected. The servers are politely enthusiastic. They made me something not on the late night menu and were gracious about it. I have been several times over the years and it gets better every time."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I ordered mixed vegetables as well as shrimp dumplings.  The shrimp dumplings were absolutely delicious.  The mixed vegetables were yummy but were very large and I was not given a knife which made it very hard to eat with chopsticks.  Also, rice did not come with the entree.  It had to be ordered separately which I did not like.  Of course, it was expensive as it was located in Cesar's Palace."}
{"text":"Shrimp dumpling tasted weird, spare rib tasted bad too. It is a typical chinese restaurant for people who don't know much about chinese food. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with management and their food. DON'T EAT HERE! You can find way better places that will provide delicious food that justifies price. The noodle soups are very bland, basically  just water with noodles that  taste  prepackaged. Food tastes very cheap!"}
{"text":"Tried this while staying at Caesars in Vegas and it was prolly best food and price of trip. I had the spicy dan dan mein noodle and it was terrific. Noodles were perfect and dish was spicy. Also ordered crispy pancakes and enjoyed as well. Priced well here and prompt service. Other reviews state how service was bad...I guess it may depend on time and day but this was at 9 pm on Saturday. If staying at Caesars I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"My husband got food poisoning after eating here on Tuesday evening. Never going back."}
{"text":"Food and service is just OK. The only difference is the decor. The fish tanks are very different and look very cool. Went once and will not go again. Might stop by to check the fish tanks though."}
{"text":"These hand tossed noddles are the business! The best part of the experience is seeing them make em live... I felt like 5 years old easily amused lol. No really it's awesome to watch.  

I got the rabbit ramen with hand tossed noddles. It came with shredded rabbit and a lot off earthy taste in the broth with greens and sprouts. I took away a star for the disorganized Host and kitchen. My dinner didn't come out with my spouses order and the host didn't seem to know English. Overall this is more of a cultural experience a little piece of Asia to experience if you will. I would come back!"}
{"text":"I had a great time in Vegas on my last visit. I was a little buzz and needed something to eat. My wife (then girlfriend) and I went to Beijing Noddle No. 9 for an afternoon meal. It was expensive and the meal was ok."}
{"text":"If you want to have some Asian food, it is okay to eat there. But if you want to enjoy Chinese food, this is not a place. We had some fake Chinese food at 10:30pm, the price is about double or triple the price of similar food elsewhere. After all, it is located within a high-end casino."}
{"text":"We were thinking that the food here must be great since it's in Caesars where we stayed at.This is beside Bacchanal.We decided to give it a try only to find out that the food taste soy sauce and it's ordinary chinese food.Not worth it.It's even pricey."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service is terrible just as all the other reviews have indicated. All the people that work here look like they hate their lives and their jobs.

Prices were also high, but this was expected as the restaurant is inside a major hotel. The honey pork pancake wrap was pretty good. The chicken lomein was a little bland.  

Overall, we wouldn't eat here again. But for a convenient location, it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place is in Caesar's palace. The same building that hosts much much better food. It was a very late night when my fiancé and I decided to replenish our tired bodies with food. We stopped by here and ordered salt and pepper chicken, shu mai, pork fried rice and steamed pork buns. 

Let's start with the good. The service was fast and the staff were friendly. The shu mai wasn't bad but 3x the cost of what it should have been. The pork buns were ok.

On with the bad. The salt and pepper chicken tasted more like salt and curry powder chicken which I'm pretty sure that's what it was. There was less than one jalapeño in the dish which gave it no spice at all. We're talking about probably 1 1/2 slices of a jalapeño. The fried rice was very bland. It needed a lot of love to make it a dish that could charge 15-20 dollars for. Don't go here even if your very drunk and hungry"}
{"text":"Expensive, but to be expected on the strip.  Brisket noodle was actually very good and the broth is probably the best I've had stateside.  Yes it comes with a lot of tendons, but for some reason the dish is served like that a lot in the US.  

Everything else is pretty meh, congee was without seasoning and inedible."}
{"text":"This is really one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in Las Vegas.  

I was really hungry and on a Sunday afternoon at Ceasers Palace food options are a bit limited because most restaurants close for the afternoon and reopen in the evening. 

So I arrived and the hostess lady said all the tables are full and that I had to wait 10-20 minutes.  She then gave me one of those vibrating alarm things that would go off when a table becomes available and she was like, \"Make sure you stay within 10 ft, so we can reach you.\"  Not sure what the whole point of the alarm is if you can't walk father than 10 feet from the restaurant....

Anyways, finally, after about 30 minutes of standing right next to the hostess, the alarm goes off and she guides me to a table in a clearly and completely EMPTY restaurant. I was a bit thrown off because it's just not nice to be lied to and certainly not nice to be kept waiting for no apparent reason.

By the time I sit down, I'm completely famished and order 2 dishes, one noodle broth and another scallops over noodles.  This is when the most ridiculous part happens...the food didn't come for another 45 minutes!  I'm not sure why it takes so long to make noodles in a completely empty restaurant.  Knowing that food options were a bit limited at the Caesars palace on a Sunday afternoon, I had no choice but to just sit there and wait.

While waiting, I ordered a coke and no...it didn't come immediately, but after another 10 minutes.  When the waitress brought me the coke, it was a can and straw, and I had to ask her for a glass so I can pour it in. 

When the food came, the \"hot\" noodles were cold (which is not surprising considering the 45 minute wait), and the \"scallops\" were falling apart and in pieces.  I had always thought scallops are in round cylindrical shapes.  Not at this restaurant!  The minute you touch them, they fell apart, which was a bit disappointing but understandable as long as they taste good. 

Unfortunately, they did not taste good.  In fact, they tasted a bit foul...and let's just say I was a bit sick for the rest of the day and could barely leave my hotel room.  

Two noodle dishes and a coke, came to about $50-$60....and all this waiting just so I can spent an entire afternoon and evening food sick in my hotel room bathroom.  

It was so not worth it...."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival, there was a homeless junkie weirdo attempting to tie a tube sock around his waist as a makeshift belt. Actually he was multi-tasking because while tying the sock he was also chatting with the fish in the two tanks that form the corridor into the restaurant. The restaurant is super lit - not 'lit AF' lit but more like the lights were beating down on you like an interrogation tactic. And the food was just meh. I went here because I saw David Chang's instagram post about the wontons in sichuan oil - maybe they made Chef Chang a special batch because I wasn't impressed with this dish. Ok food with bright lights and a view of the casino floor - you can do better in Vegas, let alone at Caesar's. Skip Bejing Noodle No. 9.

As per usual - Snack's got yo back!"}
{"text":"Despite many of the terrible reviews I've read, I still gave this restaurant a shot. My experience here was surprisingly great. The beef noodle soup was really good and the workers treated me kindly."}
{"text":"Confused about the low reviews.  We have a lot of different asian restaurants in NorCal that we go to, and I thought this place was awesome.  The hand stretched noodle bowls were awesome.  We actually went back for a second meal during our 4-day stay.
Recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was so so but absolutely overpriced. A small braised beef brisket noodle soup cost $14 and 4 tiny seafood soup dumplings cost $12. You can get these in any Chinatown at a half of the price, and they are tastier and more authentic. Nothing special about the noodle and the broth, and the beef was a bit tough. As for the soup dumplings, they didn't have any \"soup\" inside at all. But overall, like I said, the food was not good, but not terribly bad either. The worst part was actually their service! The only nice thing was their decor."}
{"text":"Super nice place but the waiters and cooks are so rude or don't understand what you're saying! This place has so much potential but needs better management."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times during my recent stays at Caesar's palace.  Why do I keep coming back?   

1) I was in a rush to grab lunch, and this was really the only \"quick eats\" place within the hotel
2) I was craving soupy noodles and this is the only place near/in Caesars 
3) I get to expense my meals when I travel on business, so cost isn't much of a concern.

Decent food, steep prices - you can get more bang for your buck at Spago / etc at the other restaurants. Waitresses are cute, and I love all of the goldfishes in the tank."}
{"text":"This place is expensive!  It's the most expensive noodles I have eaten in my life. The noodles is not bad!  In fact the noodles is pretty good. If you have the money and don't have time to get out of the casino and want noodles. Then eat here. It's fine."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the negative comments this place is bomb! We came here after Fizz and it was a gem. The food was sooo good and a lot. I ordered the special rice (I don't know the name) and my friend ordered the Noddle (don't know the name either). We really underestimated the portion size and had left overs but everything was sooooo good. I would definitely eat here again when we go back"}
{"text":"This place has subpar food and exorbitant prices (for what it is) which is never a good combo. The first time I got the tomato and egg noodles, and those were pretty tasteless. ..not to mention they came in a tiny bowl and I was hungry an hour later.  The second time,  I got the chicken chow mein, which although greasy,  was decent,  after I added a good amount of salt and two packets of hoisin sauce. 
Bottom line- save your $12-$18 and get a good lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"Poor service, attitude, however - excellent food (noodle dishes only) - So I'll give them two stars for the fresh noodles which they are known for. But honestly, the service was TERRIBLE and I could have cut the attitude with a knife - from start to finish it was off the hook - hello? I don't come to a restaurant to have 'tude thrown my way on a Sunday brunch just because I have a few questions about the menu. I also don't expect attitude from the front desk folks while I'm waiting to be seated - that's just bunk. Unfortunately, everyone was committed to trying the place out despite the attitude - I would have taken my money elsewhere. This place came highly recommended (I should have considered the source before believing them)."}
{"text":"Like a fool, I came here with a date and did not order any noodles. So I am not too sure how reliable my review can be. Anywho, the big gripe on yelp is the price of the food. Yeah, it is a little steep (nothing crazy), but maybe these people forgot that they were at one of the premier casinos on the middle of the Strip in a little town called Las Vegas - which is not exactly where you go for bargains on food. That aside, I was not overly impressed with the food, but it was solid and the ingredients were quality. The menu is crazy-extensive, so there are many dishes to come back to - if you can get past the price point. The atmosphere is really impressive, but a bit sterile. (The gold fish are awesome.) I read multiple problems with the service, but I did not have any problems on my visit - I was seated promptly and the service was attentive. Will I go back? With a Chinatown's worth of options a mere few miles away, probably not. Yet, if I was on the Strip and had a taste for Chinese, sure."}
{"text":"Peeps that know noodles will appreciate the long, hand pulled noodles.  The Dan dan mein sauce was terrific!"}
{"text":"I really wafted between 2 and 3 stars for this place. Both times I went the food was ok, but the service was so incredibly bad, I can't justify giving it more than 2 stars. Also, yes, it is in a hotel, but wow, just wow, was it expensive. Like appallingly so. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"My friend Ed recommended I come here, and he's a real Chinese food expert, being a great cook and traveler. 

Our chow mein and egg drop soup were delicious, albeit a little overpriced. They have a quick operation and a million excellent gold fish tanks. Definitely a must for Ceasar's Palace."}
{"text":"Completely overpriced but it's in Cesar's. Can't expect it to be cheap I guess. The huge plus is that it's open 24 hrs. So I can get some comfort food at 3am in the morning."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because you can see noodles being made from the casino area, and I was intrigued by the potential. I got chicken lo mein with a sauce recommended by the waiter. I found it kind of bland, and oily. The ambience is cool though. If I were to return, I'd have to pick something I know I'd like."}
{"text":"We ended up there because our 24-hour-buffet deal was about to expire in 1 hour and the line at the Caesar Palace buffet was about a 2 hour wait.  We had made a really bad choice!  I would give the gold fish tanks and the modern design a 5-star, but we were not there for the decorations.  The so-called hand-stretched noodles were not chewy at all!  Tasted like it had been soaked in the soup for a long time.  My daughter ordered beef noodle.  They didn't not have a chili symbol next to it to denote spicy food.  When the food came, there was a layer of chili oil floating on top.  I asked the waitress and all she said was \"Only a little, not spicy\" and left.   That was pretty subjective.   We had asked no eggs on the fried rice and it came with eggs!  Both the noodle and the rice were too salty.  The only OK food was the scallion pancakes. They still can't compete to the Chinese restaurants in the Asian communities in Los Angeles.  Good thing they were in Vegas where there would be cravings of semi-authentic Chinese food after eating too much buffet and the wanna-be Asian food in the Asian section.  To sum up my experience, this restaurant has pricy mediocre food that came in small portions."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered wasn't made fresh. The tossed cucumber salad was mushy, the Jelly Fish was old, 5 spiced Pork Belly was ok. Hand made noodles were half as good as Noodle Mans on Rainbow. Wonton soup was also subpar; too much soy sauce in the broth and the meat was old. The Eggplant was ok. Overall a disappointing meal. The service was excellent and the only thing of merit."}
{"text":"Fresh noodles - YUM. Everything else - Egh.

Meat was dry in every dish I had - probably pre-cooked.

I liked the noodles so much that came back to give them another chance.  Same bad, dry chicken. Some people mentioned the eggplant - maybe that is better than their carnivorous dishes.

Decor is interesting and different, but really messes with your eyes after awhile. (need to see some photos to know what I mean)

Service was slow and impersonal."}
{"text":"Quality of food was average. Way overpriced. Ordered the bbq platter that did not look anything like the picture. Portion was tiny and was more fit to be an appetizer than an entree. Very disappointing. Hot tea was 3.99 a person which is ridiculous. I wouldn't come here unless you have extra comp dollars to spend. Bright side they are open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Small portions, terribly overpriced. The quality was passable but nothing great. For the price you can hop a cab to chinatown and get way better food. Even with return cab fare you'd be ahead."}
{"text":"I love potstickers and I ordered it for my appetizer, their potstickers was so bland that even soy sauce didn't make it more tasty. So disappointed for a pricey restaurant like this, I swear I didn't even want to give tip. I don't even want to mention the entree. I will not recommend this place, sorry!"}
{"text":"This spot was so freaking gorgeous.
The food was good and the drinks too.
But I think I just fell in love with the way it looks. I just adore it."}
{"text":"Just when we couldn't take one more buffet, there was Beijing noodle co. 

I usually come to a restaurant for the food, but the decor here is fabulous!  Hard to describe dimensional wall treatments, white white white with red lanterns.  Bright and lovely, great to get away from dingy casino lighting.

Food was top notch.  We had spicy dan dan noodle, steamed dumplings, and the BBQ pork pancake.  All first rate, and loaded with flavor...spicy, but not palate-deadening,   Pancake was authentic as all get out ...just like I've tasted on street corners of TaiPei.  Dumplings weren't to my taste, but hubby happily scarfed them down.

Great fun watching the chefs make home made noodles.  No wonder they were so fresh and fluffy.  

Dinner for two with no alcohol $40. A steal, especially in a strip hotel.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yelp can be bought now? Why such a horrible restaurant have so many positive comments? This could be the worst place I have ever been. Let us be real. If you are Chinese, don't come!!! The waiter and the waitress just idle around and do nothing. The management is horrible!! I would never consider coming this place again!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst experience with a Chinese restaurant i had to date.  It's both overpriced and crappy food.

We ordered two dishes: first, \"crispy chicken with hot sauce\", $19, well, what I got was one piece of breaded & fried chicken breast on a plate (no sauces, no veggies) and one cup of dipping sauce that was mildly hot, if you excuse the oxymoron.  I wouldn't consider that prepared food.

The second dish was a pork dish with cilantro (also in the neighborhood of $20).  The pork this time was cooked with some sauce and sprinkled with cilantro stems.  Out of curiosity, I asked why stems, and what do they do with the leaves.  The answer I got was that \"it's Beijing style, we throw away the cilantro leaves\".  Pretty good comeback I have to say, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the food was plain bad.

Did I mention overpriced?  Yes, even for Las Vegas standards.  We weren't hungry so we decided to skip the buffet experience, but if we were to go to Bellagio buffet for example we would have paid less overall, and enjoyed better food."}
{"text":"If you are in Cesar's Palace and fancy yourself some Chinese food... Skip this place altogether. The decor is misleadingly impressive. I had a gift card that was authorized for use here, I checked with the manager on duty prior to being seated and he said yes. After eating the subpar food reminiscent of any typical hole in the wall (not in a good way) Chinese restaurant you'll normally frown at as you pass by, I presented the gift card which was denied by the manager. 

There are many places very nearby in which you can pay less, for higher quality food. Do yourself the favor and frown as you pass by."}
{"text":"Ridiculously poor service. Dining solo for a late lunch on a non busy weekday, waited 15 minutes to be seated, and then seated at the 5 seat counter that was empty the entire time I waited. After waiting for 8 minutes I was brought a glass of water. I placed my order with a rude, rushed lady and I never saw her again. My food was delivered about 10 minutes later by a gentleman whom I never saw again. After finishing my meal I waited another 8-9 minutes and asked another gentleman for the check. When the check was brought out I gave my name and room number and the waiter went away. 10 minutes later I had to ask the hostess to please get my check. 

Food - beef brisket noodle soup - was good. Single glass of water was fine but a refill would have been nice. Recommend the fire the entire waitstaff."}
{"text":"This have changed!!! This place has gone completely DOWNHILL! The quality, flavor and service is just gone. I ordered shrimp fried rice and the rice came out with no veggies, no green onions, no egg; just white and brown rice with shrimp added. I asked the server about the rice and she said it would be extra cost to add those ingredients. Smh. So I sent the rice back. Server was rude as well"}
{"text":"Hot, hot, hot hostess.  Didn't do anything dumb, so thats a plus.  The food is very good if a little different.  The jia jang mein(sp?) was good and similar to what I have had before.  The szechuan dun dun noodle was like nothing I ever had before, no peanut/sesame sauce at all, just hot oil.  The cold spicy noodles were different as well, but very good.  Finally, pan fied peking raviolis/pot stickers were excellent, although chive is different than the traditional chinese cabbage.  The service was fast and good.  My only quibble is about $4 for a pot of tea or glass of iced tea.  Seems unnecessarily steep.  Complaining about shark fin soup or coming for the decor is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place!!  We saw it on Ugly Delicious and thought, if it's good enough for David Chang it's good enough for us. However David Chang surely did not receive the service we did. 2 stars only because the pork in my boyfriend's soup was delicious. I watched him eating his soup and about 30 minutes in to us sitting down I was informed that my dumplings had been given to another table. We had a show to catch so I cancelled my order and asked for the check. Apologies were minimal and no discounts were offered. Would love to comment on more of the food but I didn't get to try it. So sad."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Three of us ate here this past Sunday, 11/20/11. Our server, I think his name was Tony, took our order without explaining that the entrees do not come with rice. That alone is not too bad and we dealt with it. The problem is Tony never checked back with us the entire time we were there! We had to order the rice from a different server. We also didn't have any soy sauce on our table which all the other tables did have. Again no one stopped by our table so we could not ask for a bottle of soy sauce so we just had to take one from a different table.

Yes the food was pretty good, but overall this restaurant is totally not worth the price!($17 for three glasses of iced tea?! Our overall bill was $75.) There are plenty of other great restaurants on the Strip where you will get great food and excellent service. I will never go back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Damn, don't be hatin' on No. 9.

Yes, YES its expensive.... its in CEASAR'S PALACE.  Have you ever been to some place in a CASINO themed as a PALACE and gotten anything cheap?  Hell, a room service box of cereal would be at least 8 bucks.

The decor is spectacularly cool, with suspended pattern carved curved ceilings and rows and rows of goldfish tanks.  A guy in the kitchen is hand-stretching the noodles and the noodle dishes are authentic.  I enjoyed myself thoroughly and the cold hand stretched noodles in szechuan sauce were extremely delicious.

The service was a bit slow, but don't be hatin'."}
{"text":"Beef chow fun was tasty and good.  The hand pulled noodles with beef was good, but not the best.   The soup could have been better and pho I think is better in taste and value.  The price is reasonable for hotel food.  One bit of caution is that the tea is charged per person instead of per table or pot."}
{"text":"Wow this place is freakin cool looking!
My waitress was excellent. Very kind. The dumplings I got for an appetizer were okay. If you don't prefer crispy to chewy like I do, you might love them. My noodles were awesome! A great place with amazing decor and a cool environment."}
{"text":"Great looking decor, but bland food and wait staff that is unhelpful. Ordered beef brisket with tendon soup, handmade noodles. As expected the tendons were hunks of tough fat...nasty (guy with me recommended it!).  Noodles were ok. Not horrible, but we could have done better."}
{"text":"The portions are small, taste was average, and the price was expensive. Tasted better in downtown for way less the cost. 4 people cost over $150 and we left hungry!"}
{"text":"When my family and I were on vacation in Vegas, we decided to go here for dinner before a show. The wait was 30 minutes, which was fine, but when we got to our table, there were barely people in there. That made me question why we had to wait so long. Perhaps they had too few servers that day, but even that is questionable.

Our family ordered the duck and bbq pork egg noodle soups. I know we didn't order a variation, so it's difficult for me to review the restaurant as a whole. However, these soups were decent, but nothing spectacular. Pretty plain with just noodles, the meat, and a few stalks of Chinese broccoli. The portions were quite large but for the quality, it's not worth the price we paid. Everything in Vegas is expensive, so it's unavoidable, even for a bowl of noodles.

Our server was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is really bright and modern, with walls consisting of overlaying curliques. I was a bit annoyed with the kitchen staff constantly dropping plates, which was really obvious in the otherwise quiet restaurant.

Would only go back if I was craving Chinese food but it's not an amazing experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Cucumber Appetizer and Seafood Wonton Soup are a must!!!  Service is slow but food makes up for it!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here to eat at least once whenever I come to Las Vegas. I love love the wonton soup noodle in chicken broth. However, the bbq platter was so expensive for so little amount of meat. The duck was extremely flavorful but the rest were just on par with SamWoo's. 

But yeah, I don't understand why they make you wait 20 min when the tables aren't full...other than that, the service and food are good to me."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this place. Had the beef and broccoli and it was by far the worst rendition of this meal I've ever had. Would never recommend this spot to anybody. The service was slow and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"OMG this place is SO COOL!!!!! It was like watching foodNet or No Reservations-Beijing in person.  The \"noodle-master\" was actually stretching out noodles and skillfully slicing off noodles behind the counter while I was eating.  The fish tanks inside the restaurants are cool but if theres a guy making noodles I highly suggest eating at the bar!  I ordered the mini-wonton soup with hand stretched noodles and it was delicious.  Very rarely have I ever had such clean, flavorful, and delicious broth in dishes like this that weren't heavily laden with fat floating on the top. My server Becky was super nice and expedient as well as the other staff that kept my water glass constantly full.    It's kinda pricey at almost $20.00 but I am for SURE going back."}
{"text":"Every friend of mine (and granted, most of them are FOB Chinese) that has visited Beijing Noodle Company has complained about the place, citing that the food was terrible, the service was terrible, etc.

However, I decided to visit anyways...needing a quick place to grab something to eat for my little toddler. Expecting the worst, I came out of the experience pleasantly surprised. 

The decor will get you the first time you walk in...it feels like you are eating inside a giant egg, with millions of goldfish surrounding you (yes, I know eggs and fish don;t necessarily go together - but someone should have told the designers of this place). 

The food though, was not terrible. Sure, it was not super authentic, but it wasn't tasteless or horrible. It reminded me...well, it reminded me of something I can find at any Chinese Cafe in Houston. I ordered both a stir fried noddle dish and a veggie dish, and both were good enough to continue eating.

The prices are steep...as all Vegas prices on the Strip are, so let's just stop complaining about that. Having said that, the service was the only thing I was disappointed about, but not so much that I have to complain on Yelp. They were slow, but not so much that I was wondering where my food or water was at all times. It just seemed odd that it took as much time as it did with a half empty restaurant to bring two dishes out...but that is all I will really say about the service. We all have our off days and times during the day when production is not what it should be...I get it!

Either way, this is not a bad place to spend some time, especially if you need a quick bite and you happen to find yourself reliving the Hangover Part I. Not to mention, noodles are good eats especially if you find yourself pulling out your own incisor just to win a bet or prove a point!"}
{"text":"While waiting to get into the Buchanal Buffet, I was so hungry that I had to stop at Beijing Noodle No. 9.  They had bbq pork buns and all kinds of dim sum dishes.  It was tasty but surprisingly empty inside.  In the entrance, they have huge aquariums packed with tons of goldfish... its kind of random but cool looking."}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp dumplings, and they all fell apart since they were over cooked. We order two bowls of rice, which costed $4 each. The braised sea bass was good. The scallops and asparagus was ok. The hot and sour soup was ok. Overall, I felt like I was in a cafeteria but charged $12 for shrimp dumplings and $4 for a bowl of rice. The host was not friendly and the waiters forgot the basics like spoons, pepper, dipping dishes and we had to keep flagging them down. I did see them pulling their own handmade noodles which I do like."}
{"text":"This is a neat place. The ambiance is quirky and fun, and being able to watch the chefs make the noodles from scratch is a nice touch. 

The food is great. The meals are very satisfying and the flavors are delicious. If I was rating based on food alone, I would probably give this restaurant 5 stars. 

Unfortunately, the service tends to be a bit off. The hostesses often seem bored and indifferent, and our server once disappeared for nearly 30 minutes. 

Nonetheless, the quality of the food is good enough to make the overall experience positive, and I would gladly come back for more."}
{"text":"The décor and atmosphere of this place is really neat - with aquarium columns setup in the front of the restaurant.  Foodwise, my friend and I split the YangZou Fried Rice which was good, but I noticed they used the spam-like pork in the rice, which I'm not a fan of..  We also shared the Shrimp and Chive dumplings which were ok - something was missing in the flavor of these, and they were a bit drier than I would've liked. Overall, not bad food for the price, but not something to get excited about."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch here! Greeted by beautiful goldfish tanks and pretty hostesses. The origami-like decor is impressive! The cuisine is just as stellar. :) Very fresh & authentic tasting. You are able to see the chefs hard at work from your table. I tried the salt & pepper shrimp, (many huge, juicy shrimps that were very tasty!) some kind of fried fish in a black bean sauce, (which was very flavorful and had been accompanied by yummy fried veggies) also tried the hand-pulled noodles in an eggplant sauce. (Sauce was savoury with eggplant chunks; no need for any meat in this dish) Very fair prices; show your Total Rewards card for a bit of savings! The wait for a table wasn't bad, only waited a few minutes but if you are worried that the restaurant might be very busy and you absolutely hate waiting, there's a reservation hotline number listed on the Beijing Noodle No. 9 Yelp page! Good stuff, check it out!"}
{"text":"Only come here if you don't have other choice. The taste is fair so I give it three stars, but the food portion and the ingredients with this price I would said it's way too little."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that I wish I would have consulted Yelp about before visiting. However, we were hungry and the Bacchanal Buffet had a monstrous line so we found ourselves at Beijing Noodle because it was close by. As soon as we sat down, I pulled up Yelp on my phone and realized that we should have picked a different location. Beijing Noodle is not for those who are hungry or have tight budgets. The portion sizes are small and the prices are high. 

I ordered the chow mein noodles with beef and chicken. I made sure to emphasize that I didn't want pork. However, when my food arrived and I noticed three meats. The waitress apologized and quickly brought me a new plate. Here's how I know that the portions are small. I actually finished the entire dish in one sitting. I never finish a meal at a restaurant and I didn't even feel full. The noodles were great but for $20 I expect more. My boyfriend and his dad each ordered the beef chow fun ($17) and easily finished their plates too. 

The service was friendly but they should really reevaluate either their portions or prices."}
{"text":"I really liked the place....What sucked me in first was the beautiful white interior....then I saw the fish, which is too many in one tank....

Our waitress was reallly awsome! She was sooper friendly and joked around with us. The food was really, really good....I got a noodle bowl and a side of fried rice and the noodles were great and the fried rice was a new and wonderful take on fried rice....it wasn't the homoganized fried riced that is doused in soy sauce it was white in colour with a lot of fresh veggies....yum....

Yes our tab was a little higher it was about $43.00 but heck we are in the hotel and unless you go to a disgusting buffet you are going to expect to pay more. My friend I I split a appitizer, I had a noodle bowl, fried rice and even though I generaally don't drink a glass of wine. 

I would go back agin next time I am there."}
{"text":"I am confused by some of the reviews. I can only assume it's a matter of taste!
For us the food was fresh and delicious.
The decor was stunning and the service excellent.
Fried pork dumplings were not your average pot stickers and the pea leaves were fresh and delicious.
My wife is Chinese and very fussy she gives it 4 stars too it must be good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times. The food is great! Not too greasy and very tasty. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews. 
The most recent visit was a few days ago around 6pm. Service was fast. I have experienced their slow service but they were very busy. The busiest times i went were in the later eve...after 9pm. Besides that....i think this place is worth visiting. I love the decor and the goldfish!"}
{"text":"Came here twice , first time was told the wait time was 35 minutes and there were seats unoccupied. So I left , next day I went back because I wanted some vegetables . We got seated within 12 minutes around 2 pm.

I ordered the dan dan mein it was good however I don't think my stomach can handle the oil it comes with .

The spicy wonton was good but lacking meat

The garlic pea sprouts were very garlicky and left an after taste in my mouth for the whole night

The veggies came out first like 10 minutes

The noodles came out in 20 minutes and the wontons came out like 30 minutes after .

This is the slowest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to in my life ."}
{"text":"don't come here!! It's not worth to spend any of your money here. We were going to the buffet, but wait time is to long since we have 2 babies with us, so we just pick the restaurant  next to it. I should have read the review first, so I won't choice here. 
When we were waiting to be seat, and finally 2 girls come, but they are too busy at chating, and just ignore us. when I tell one of the girl we have 2 babies, she show me a look that she dosen't want us to eat in this restaurant, and tell me there's no table for us while there are all empty tables. I don't understand, my babies are super quite, not make any noise, even if customer's baby is loud, don't you think her attitude is still not appropriate. When we asking a high chairs, 1 of the high chair is oily and have some food in there, we ask if she can help us clean it, and she told me it's already clean, OMG, are you blind, I don't want to say something like this, but this girl really ruin my dinner. She also forgot to give us menu...OMG, manager, or owner, can you train your employee?  
for its taste, and service their prices are way to high."}

When ordering to go, the service is always professional, the food excellent.
This time i decided to dine-in. My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like \"put it in a dixie cup!\" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!"}
{"text":"1,200 sparkling glinty goldfish welcome you to the inside of the aquarium to commune with the most fantastic shrimp dumplings. Do yourself a favor and order the best hot and sour soup I've ever had. 
 I really got the feeling that this was not just a restaurant in Caesar's but rather a respite from the smokey,tacky glory that is Vegas. One of the most brilliant interior designs, with pops of warm colors heating up the snowy garden that is the inside. The employees were sweetly attentive and I watched them work as a well coordinated team. 
 Yes, lunch for two was $50, but it was worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here, noodles were delicious. I'm surprised by negative reviews for this place was perfect, good service and great food."}
{"text":"Fresh hand made noodles made right in front of you.  The portions are good this is a casual dining place. I came here for the duck noodle soup and my hubby ordered the beef chow fun."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Not just the servers,but the manager in the suit too. Ingored by 3 servers and the manager after waiting 15 minutes to order. Hostess was friendly and quick though."}
{"text":"I was skeptical based on the reviews but I really liked this place.  It was nice, clean, and neat!  It is also affordable and the portions are very big.  My husband and I wished we had split a meal because there was so much.  We ordered our favorite General tso chicken.  It was crispy and the perfect amount of sauce.  We also had the veggie fried rice.   We ordered based on the review that the portions were small but that was not the case for us."}
{"text":"Based on food alone this place would fail in a minute if located in Cali, east bay, or any highly populated asian community.  With that said this is vegas hence the 2 stars.    

Food-
food portions are small (to be expected).  This place its value orientated for asians in vegas.  
Beef Noodle Soup-Not impressed; nothing special; somewhat cold when delivered
Szechuan noodles and pork!-Not impressed;not spicy enough;nothing unique
War Wonton Noodle Soup-HORRIBLE; no flavor, bad noodles, no flavor in dumplings. 
Green Onion Pancake-HORRIBLE-your better off finding your favorite frozen brand.  Came out cold and no flavor
chow fun-u can smell the wok heat, but still just ok

-=the best of the night=-
Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings-good flavor.  individual bao vary on attention of detail.  Sauce occasioned was spot on

either had  Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice or Fu Zhou Fried Rice, Gravy style
Shrimp, Scallop, Mushrooms,Asparagus, Eggs-nice flavor.  nice and oily, but delish.   

The good-
Line/wait-fairly short both times under 1hour about 45 minutes.  arrived before lunch/dinner rush.

Ok-
For those deprived of good authentic Chinese sure eat your heart out.  My auntie from HI thought it was good.  For those that know you got it good pass this spot up  

Bad-
Service-The same unattentive service you expect expect in chinatown.  Waiters need training and more discipline.  It does not look good to stand around playing on your phone or speaking overly loud where customers can hear your conversations.  

Hostesses-not very host like these girls need replacing.  Do some work other than just standing up front and then ducking in the back

I came here for the hand made noodles and thus put in an order and informed only after I ordered that there were none available.  I then asked the waiter to inform me when the chef was making more so we could put in an order.  NOPE had to spot the chef making more and flag down our waiter to order.  Sure, hand tossed tasted better than store bought, but not at the price."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty!  We ordered the Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, Beef Bejing Pancake, and Beef Chow Mein.  I'm not a fan of seafood, but I did try the dumplings.  They were really \"shrimpy\"  which I guess is the point.  LOL.  The Beef Bejing Pancake was interesting.  It kind of looked like a burritio that was cut into slices.  The outside was crisp and the inside was very flavorful.  There was something cold inside of it.  I didn't take it apart to see what it was, but it kind of threw me off.  It wasn't bad, just different.  I still ate it.  The Beef Chow Mein was great and it was enough for me and hubby to share.  I also had Shanghi Wave (drink)?  I think that was the name of it.  Soooo good.  We will definatley be back."}
{"text":"Nice decor and great service, but some of the blandest food I've had in a long time.  We had the chicken chow mein and bbq port with choy sum noodle soup."}
{"text":"We ended up at Beijing Noodle No. 9 by accident because Bacchanal Buffet had a two hour wait on a Sunday night!  So, we moseyed over next door because my hungry stomach could not handle driving elsewhere.  Walking into Beijing Noodle No. 9, I felt that something was not quite right.  The hostesses were super nice, servers had the efficiency of a Chinese restaurant BUT with a kind smile.  Staff were all milling around at what seemed like a very well oiled machine.  What?  You'll bring my dessert promptly after we're finished with the main meal?  What?  You offered my husband another beer?  (He was so shocked that he did not accept his usual second beer.)  The interior was not only clean, but it was also bright and incredibly well designed.  Drawers were professionally labeled.  No, we were not in a Chinese restaurant, but we were in the surely in the twilight zone.

I have a theory there is an inverse relationship (not sure if linear or exponential) between Americanization of the restaurant (so that includes service, decor, cleanliness) and the tastiness of the food.  The cleaner, the prettier the decor and the more ept or polite the staff is, the less tasty the food probably is.  The opposite would be the dirtier, the uglier the decor, the more the staff barks at you, the increasingly tasty the food is.  

Where does Beijing Noodle No. 9 fall?

Watching the chef hard at work hand stretching the noodles, I was hopeful for perfectly chewy al dente noodles.  It was amazing watching the entire process.  Boing... Stretch Twirl... Boing... Stretch Twirl.  

Food:
* The hand stretched noodles lacked the chew like the well developed gluten that would be in perfect noodles.  Sad face.
1.  Sichuan Dan Dan Mian - Let's talk about the sauce.  It was nice and spicy and a touch on the salty side.
2.  Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon Noodle Soup with hand stretched noodles - Perhaps my cantonese self is used to really robust flavors, but this soup somehow lacked some depth.  Braised usually means tender meat, but the chunks of brisket were decidedly chewy.  Overall, it was good but not the best.
3.  Choy Sum - Great wok hei and seasoning, but the portion size was pitiful.  
4.  Xiao Long Bao (XLB/Soup Dumplings) - Very juicy and soupy - the soup filled the entire soup spoon!  Where they did not quite reach XLB nirvana was in the dumpling skin.  It was not as thin and membranous as the famous Din Tai Fung's.
5.  Sweet Red Bean Buns (mei gui dou sha bao) - Two out of the three were delicious.  The bun was fluffy and not dry, and the inside was filled with smooth and sweet red bean paste.  The third bun opened up to dry and crusty red bean.  Pleh!

Prices:  Outrageous!  I would say each dish was two to three times the price that we were used to.  I'll chalk it up to the fact that the place is located in casino, and being that it was so \"swanky\" in decor and with well-trained staff, they needed to mark dishes up for the cost of running the place.  On a side thought - perhaps, we've all been spoiled by rock bottom prices at other Chinese restaurants and like how Korean and Japanese food is pricier, Chinese food should be priced similarly?  

Conclusion:  So the inverse relationship is true in this case.  It was swanky; the food was average.  For average food that I can get cheaper and tastier elsewhere (i.e. Yi Mei Deli), I probably don't recommend coming back.  Shows me for eating Chinese food in a casino!"}
{"text":"I ordered Dan Dan noodle. It was not made in the right way. There was no soup with the noodle and it was very dry. They just put some sauce on the noodle and left it for you to stir. The noodle was not enough for an adult as a meal. At last, it cost 21 dollars! The noodle is not worth 5 dollars and any cheap eatery in China can do better than it. It was the worst restaurant experience ever in my life. I would give -5 star if I could. I'm angry with the food.  Do not go there. In Chinese, ?????????"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
The interior definitely stands out in Caesars. It's very... shiny. It's kind've tucked away in a corner. I didn't even notice it the first time I walked by until my girlfriend mentioned it to me.

Service:
We arrived just as it was opening for lunch - we were the second group to arrive and waited maybe a minute to be seated. With it being the beginning of the shift I'm assuming there was some confusion as to who's table we were as we saw 3 different servers during our lunch.

However various servers didn't slow down us getting our drinks or our orders.

Our actual server was extremely helpful with our selection.

Food:
I saw a few comments about it being very \"Americanized\" but I would imagine that depends on the dish. We ordered mostly appetizers we were familiar with from our adventures with Dim Sum and it was comparable... at least to the various dim sum options around Atlanta.

The only thing that really stood out for me were the Soup Dumplings - both variations.

The stir fried veggies were just okay.

Everything else we ordered was rather subpar for the price. Including the pork ribs, fried rice, and chow mein.

Having never had them before I thought these things were amazing!


Overall:
I think if I had a crazing for dumplings I would make a stop here again otherwise it's a one and done for me. There are just too many other Chinese options in Vegas to make this another go-to."}
{"text":"First you are lured in by the attraction of the fish tank.  It's all very deceiving, Chinese servers and it's of course, over-priced, so you think to yourself, perhaps I'll go ahead and treat myself to this restaurant transplant from Shanghai.

You are mistaken.  Turn around and find  better food at a better price at a dive somewhere off the strip.

The Xiao Long Bao's skin was tough and the shrimp noodle soup was tasteless and had three small shrimp."}
{"text":"When my husband and I dined here on Saturday night around 8, the restaurant was full with a wait list.  Our waiter was inattentive as he was also serving a large party.  Trying to eat healthy, we ordered the braised sea bass in a clay pot and the Yangzhou shrimp fried rice.  The meal took a long time to be brought out--we assumed that was due to the clay pot preparation.  After more than 30 minutes the waiter walked by and said it was almost ready.  Finally a dish in a clay pot and the barely warm fried rice arrived.  But in the clay pot was some heavily battered and fried fish, not the braised sea bass we ordered. We questioned the waiter about this and were told that was the Chinese preparation.  Looking back over the menu later, it seems they substituted the deep fried sea bass with sweet and spicy sauce, although the small amount of fish in the bites did not look like sea bass--perhaps the restaurant was out of sea bass. That deception is totally unacceptable--I couldn't eat the dish due to a gluten allergy and my husband tried to eat a little fish out of the batter. However, due to the waiter's statement and not having a menu in front of us, we paid for the dish."}
{"text":"Came here straight from early evening flight expecting strong Chinese flavors but was just mild. Fried rice was OK so was the stir fried vegetables. Pricey for the lack of flavors. Might not come back here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Had the brisket soup and it was very small.  The brisket was very fatty and not as tender as I had believed.  I came in on lunch break being that I work at several hotels on the strip.  I deal with a lot of tourists and like to know what's good and what's not.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to the thousands of tourists I deal with on a yearly basis."}
{"text":"Ate here with my husband celebrating his early birthday :) and the entire experience was amazing!!  We got seated right away, to the service and of course the delicious food!! Beijing Noddle No. 9 is Definitely a Super Good place to eat."}
{"text":"No idea why this place gets bad reviews. We went there at lunchtime and it was packed. We were given menus quickly and the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg I had was wonderful. Servers were working hard but we didn't have to wait for anything. Great experience and will definitely be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Here's the skinny:

It's pretty over priced for an Americanized Chinese place. Average dish was roughly $15-$20. 

They have Vietnamese coffee w/boba, and it comes in a large = awesome, and SUPER strong too! They also have soy milk w/boba and fruit (watermelon, etc)..  prices are between $5-$7.

Their dishes come down to a few options:
- beef
- pork
- soup
- rice
- noodles 

.. but I didn't come across any signature dishes you typically would at a true Chinese restaurant (ie. Pan fried noodles, combination plates like chow fun, etc).

Their white and orange hand blown glasses are really pretty, and the decor is cool too. Service was OK, and the food is cooked fresh. I could tell the noodles in our chow fun were hand made, I'd say those were my favorite of everything we had.  Oh!  the salt and pepper shrimp are yummy too!

Servings are 'A la carte (aka family style)' BUT the portions are smaller than a traditional Chinese place."}
{"text":"This place has one of the most beautiful interiors - huge tanks of goldfish in the front, and a sleek white and red decor inside.  Like Noodles in Bellagio, expect to pay 2x to 3x the usual price in say Chinatown for noodle dishes.  Note they have a dual price structure - Caesars reward members get a buck off each dish or so.

I got the Dan Dan noodles with spring noodles and an order of six pan-seared pot stickers.  I got the wife the Shanghai-style wonton with shrimp and egg noodles.

Dan Dan noodles looked a bit light on sauce but it turned out to be a good ratio since it had some serious kick.  Very good noodles - round, smooth, and slightly chewy.  Pot Stickers were excellent - worth the 15 mins prep time since they were golf-ball sized with a single edge that was perfectly seared. The skin around the seared edge was soft, but it held the juicy pork-cabbage filling perfectly.  The dark sauce also had a nice spicy kick.

I  only took a nibble from my wife's dish and it was OK.  Definitely lighter mellow broth characteristic of Cantonese style.  The prawns and wontons in her bowl were huge!

I like this place slightly better than Bellagio's Noodles. They do seem to know how to add kick to their Northern-style noodles and dumplings."}
{"text":"After watching Ugly Delicious I knew that I wanted to check out David Chang's recommendation at Caesar's Palace. My parents and I had lunch at the restaurant and we were seated right away. The service was excellent. We had a variety of servers helping us, bringing our food and refilling our drinks. They offer a pre-fixe lunch menu on weekdays from 10am-4pm that includes a soup, a appetizer (this is really more of a \"side\" item) and an entree. We ordered the pre-fixe (chicken and corn soup, crispy vegetable spring rolls, and the stir-fried beef with aspargus and white rice) as well as the seafood chow mein and shared everything. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. My favorite items were definitely the noodles and the spring rolls. Given our experience I would definitely be willing to go again to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Four stars for their food! I've been to Beijing Noodle 9 a handful of times and haven't been disappointed with their food. I've ordered appetizers to noodles and rice dishes to take out only and my food expectations were met each time.  

One star for their service! I understand Chinese folks aren't the warmest and fuzziest..I'm Chinese myself and know that service is not something our culture strive on. However, being that this restaurant is part of Caesar Palace's restaurants, I had higher expectations that their wait staff and front end staff would provide a nicer dining experience. I was wrong. 

The hostess, a young Chinese gal appeared to hate her job. As the hostess, I would imagine someone who at the very least says hi or greets the customer in some fashion with maybe, just maybe a smile. No, not this one. She appeared upset and just not happy overall. People leaving would say good bye and she would look at them and look away without a response. So odd, so weird, so unhappy, so she should probably get another job outside of the hospitality industry.

Waitstaff are rude and seems bothered when you ask for hot chili sauce, give you the side eye when you ask for a hot water refill for your teapot.

It won't stop us from going back though because the food is good even though service sucks, it's tolerable."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews here. I would give this place 4 stars but im going with 5 since 2.5 stars is crazy.  This was the best meal I had in vegas. I am from vancouver and have been to china, so I have eaten some top notch chinese food, including a lot of beef noodle. The noodles here compete with anything I have had and you wont find anything as good in vegas I dont think. Hand pulled noodles were delicious. Prices are reasonable for vegas. Much cheaper and better than trendy places like momofuku. Good service. If you only like americanized chinese food, general tsaos etc, this might not appeal to you. Nothing wrong with that type of food but this is something different to try. I would definitely come back and you should try it because it wont blow the bank."}
{"text":"Went with my closest friends for our annual Christmas dinner, and we were all sorely disappointed.  Decor is interesting but very bright, and if you stare at them long enough, you'll get dizzy.  Food is okay, but extremely overpriced.  Food presentation is very unappetizing.  Ordered soup and it looked like dishwater with mushrooms floating on it.  For the price they charge, we at least expected a good portion of food, but expected too much again.  Service was undesirable.  Server obviously trying to avoid eye contact when she notice we need something.  She also acts as if we should be thankful that she's there to serve us.  One of the worst dining experience I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great decoration, the gold fishes in the huge tanks in the entry are really cool. The cool playing with his noodles is great animation. 
BUT when it comes to the food, it's not the same story maybe it was too \"Chinese food\" for us. 
Hubby took roasted duck, but there was not much meat but lots of bones to chew on. 
Daughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth. 
I was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles. 

Basically, we will not come back never ever! 

Take pictures, but go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"After they served me the noodles they dipped from the fishtank I threwup in my mouth a little bit. Good thing I had some ass & sour soup to wash down that fish and bile taste. I went out to the Caesers Palace swanky pool and tried to drown myself for paying more than $30 for the two amazingly slimey dishes. Come to this place if you love eating fish crap! 

CJ out!!"}
{"text":"Food was marginal at best, service was awful. Was expecting a decent meal, and got Airport-quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"Average food, or maybe I should say it is below the average. Especially when you consider about its price... 

None of the food here is either traditional Chinese food nor good taste dishes!

Do not come here!!!

You can find a lot of much better Chinese food in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Despite the rating this place got, I thought the food experience was pretty decent. It's a little spendier, but hey you're on the strip at Caesars-- no money, no honey. There's a Panda Express across Las Vegas Blvd in case you want cheap Chinese food (if that's even Chinese). 

The white interior and mosaic decor is stunning and mesmerizing, with the feeling of an upscale techno club melded with a spaceship cafeteria. Absolutely genius and unique for a Chinese restaurant! Service was friendly, but messed up one of our orders. Our friend had to wait 10 additional minutes for her corrected order while we were slurping our noodles. 

I had the BBQ pork noodle soup which was delicious, stock was fresh and clear, meat was tender and flavorful. The noodles were cooked to an over al dente firmness but went down well together with the pork slices. The serving size was perfect for me and satisfied my hunger without that bloating or fullness sensation. 

Tip to service: double check your customer's order."}
{"text":"I have eaten here more times than I can count. And with each experience I leave loving something new. Before moving to Nevada it was always the first place we would go when visiting. And now it is the first place we take visitors when they are passing through.

My favorites: Either the hand pulled noodles or the Knife cut ones. They are both amazing and different in their own right. I love the eggplant sauce and the pork & mushroom sauce. 

On this last visit the server (Tommy) (AMAZING) offered a sampling of all sauces and those two continued to be my favorites.

My husband always orders the shrimp dumplings and the pork dumplings. And I love the bbq pork buns. All three cooked to perfection each time. 

Another favorite is the beef fried rice. Very delicate flavors all popping in your mouth. 

The soup dumplings are a must, but be warned, they are difficult to eat at first try! 

Drink wise it is always the lychee martini. And/or the iced coffee. Depending on who's driving! 

This last trip we tried the mochi. Loved them! My favorite flavors were red bean, mango and chocolate. And I always save room for an almond cookie. I think the flaky buttery cookie is the best way to end a fabulous night of food."}
{"text":"This place's noodle (????) is the best I have ever had since I came America 5 years ago. love it!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty blah. Had to add plenty of hot sauce and even soy sauce for flavor. I had the brisket noodle soup and I would say most of the meat was fat so only about half of it was edible. They could have taken a little more fat off before cooking it. And that was the dish the waiter recommended. I also ordered a drink that was just ok. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was staying at Caesars for a convention recently and I picked up Chicken Chow Mein to go here twice during my stay. 

Great portion size, tasty sauce, lots of chicken, good veggies and amazing noodles! 

My to go orders were always ready quickly."}
{"text":"Have been here before, but did not write a review.  The decor is beautiful! hostess are efficient, and very Helpful, Must have a Reservation, they are always Busy, The food is the star, Delicioso! An incredible meal and unique cocktails! Lemonade please try that, Just enjoy the Food, don't pay attention to the negative comments, we all have different taste, go see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. They are open later than some other restaurant so that's a plus. The white interior is different although it seemed too bright to me and looked dingy in some areas. The soup dumplings were good but the stir fried noodles with beef were disappointing. The chow mein at Panda Express has more flavor."}
{"text":"Avoid this place because bad and pricy food! We had the worse Shaw-Long-Bau with $3 each ($12 for 4).

Pros:
- Clean
- Nice set up
- In the Caesars Palace
- Friendly staffs

Cons:
- Bad food (not tasty at all (below average)
- Very pricy (about 300% than food in China Town)"}
{"text":"Wow.

Wish I had checked Yelp before eating here.

The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)

Food is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the cheong-sam dressed Asians they have at the front.  Actually, that should have been a warning sign.  It being a \"Chinese restaurant\" in Caesar's should have been warning enough.

The place advertises itself as \"authentic\" hand-pulled noodles.

Yes, it's noodles.  And NO, it ain't authentic.

Supposedly their \"best-seller\" was the hand pulled noodles with shrimp/pork wontons.  

The noodles were the WORST I have had in a long time.  Soggy, sad, thin little things with no texture.  Wontons were nothing to write home about.  Soup was on par with Cup O Noodles broth.  A relatively small bowl of -- blah -- for:

                                        ****   $17.00  ****

Tip: DON'T GO.

Or, if you must go, don't expect authentic food.

(ps - the one star is for the cute fish!)"}
{"text":"Surprised to see the negative reviews. This is one of my favorite Vegas places. Great food and I've never had service issues there and I've eaten there maybe a dozen times. If you're skeptical, take a chance and go. I've never had a bad experience.

I especially recommend the mini wontons in hot chili oil appetizer and the eggplant in szechuan garlic sauce entree. Service is accurate and prompt.

A reservation is not a bad idea for a large party, but my wife and I walked in at 645 on a Saturday night and got a table right away."}
{"text":"The interior is stunning, but the prices are exorbitant for average Chinese food.  If you can't make it to Chinatown, then this place will suffice."}
{"text":"This place is a total ripped off. There were so many empty tables left in the restaurant, and It didnt seem to be very busy. I ordered a wonton for togo and had to wait for 30 mins for it, because the hostess said they were so busy. Luckily, I didnt ask to dine in, the line was 2hrs wait (wtf).
The wonton was a total scam. They made it with thick wraps and a tat of meats in it. Keeping in mind, it was tasteless. 
The management of this place should be taking notes of how things run, or this place might get 1 star review pretty soon."}
{"text":"I thought it was delicious compared to previous reviews and customer service is great. HOWEVER, it gets 3 stars because it's too expensive for the food quality and portions. The food doesn't taste super gourmet, it's decent, good enough, but it's too expensive for the quality. 

The stir fry mix vegetables are good, shrimp fried rice is good and the pork soup dumplings are decent but not compared to REAL soup dumplings if you've ever had Din Tai Fung"}
{"text":"I came across this place after the line at Bacchanal was ridiculous. I personally love hand pulled noodles as not every Chinese restaurant offers it. I ordered Dan Dan Mian and absolutely loved it. It had the spice I was craving and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I must have come here at the right time as the customer service was better than what others have experienced.

Let me warn you, the prices are higher than what you'd expect. The thing is... it's located inside Caesars Palace and not Chinatown."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is uniquely beautiful! The service is nice. However, the beef hot pot was unsatisfactory. $45.00 gone down the drain. The pork rib sweet vinegar dish tasted alright and a bowl of white rice costs an extra $3.99. 
Do not be tempted by their interior display. The food is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Great environment - sleek decor. Food from rural China skillfully brought to Vegas with panache. 
Watch the cook throw dough around and make noodles and then order it.  
I come here everytime I stop by the Caesars Palace, even when I'm not hungry. Since I'm staying in CP this time, my second time eating here in 3 days."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!! My food showed up 20 minutes after my friends food and they didn't even offer to comp my meal. The service is horrible and extremely rude. Our waiter didn't come check on our table once. I had to find someone to check on my missing plate of fried rice. How long could it possibly take to make fried rice?!? Once I got the fried rice, it was seriously just rice with eggs. The plate was extremely unappetizing and all brown. There wasn't one vegetable in the fried rice. Who doesn't add vegetables to fried rice?? There was absolutely no flavor to the dish. When u cook fried rice, onions and bell peppers generally add flavor to the dish. Apparently the cooks at this kitchen don't know what's up. The Asian food at the Caesar's Palace buffet tasted better than this food. Oh...and don't get the tea. They charge you $15 for 1 small pot of tea!! Are you kidding me?!?  It's freaking tea!!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat much during my trip and was really sad that I wasted a meal here. Presentation of the food looked really nice but the food itself was soooo mediocre. Dan dan noodles had a HEAVY peppercorn taste, I couldn't even finish it because my tongue was tingling the entire time. The best thing that we ordered was the eggplant, which is kind of sad."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this place would surprise me as it is the only location I have seen in Vegas that pulls their own noodles.  Coming from souther CA and growing up with Noodle House in Rowland Heights that pulled their own noodles too I was expecting a lot more than what we got.  

The first tip that we should have left and not eaten there was the lack of big table for huge parties.  There were two on opposite ends of the restaurant that would seat 10 people at each table.  The decor was ultra modern that came out of a magazine but that didn't help the food. 

We ordered two dishes as we were eat an early dinner.  We had the pork and shrimp won tons with pulled noodles and the general tsao's chicken.  My biggest complaint was the food was BLAND!!!!  The broth that was with the noodles had no flavor.

The chicken was bland as well.  Though I was hoping it would be more like a pepper sauce the dish was more of a peking style but was not sweet like I'm used to.  Overall I would not come back it was 45 for two dishes and water."}
{"text":"Experiencing Las Vegas for the first time, when I walked into Caesar's Palace compared to some of the other casinos, I was blown away. 

My girlfriend and I decided that this place looked great to eat since the decor was inviting. (The goldfish walls were pretty awesome.)

However, the hostess wasn't very friendly at all and made us wait to be seated in an almost empty restaurant...okay not a big deal.

Then the server came over, dropped menus and walked away...okay am I missing something?

Then when he made time for us and we kindly asked to recommend something, he mumbled the \"Beef Brisket Noodle\" which wasn't appetizing at all. 

But what really took the cake for me was after we finished our meal, we waited maybe 20 minutes before we had to ask ANOTHER server to bring our bill. 

The real shame was: for such a nice casino, you would think a restaurant that takes up prime real estate would get their *%&# together."}
{"text":"To be honest, I came here for the decor only. And I figured it can't really be that bad food wise.

The decor and layout is beautiful and very unique.  Two long rows of goldfish tanks.  And white cut out damask designs all over the ceiling and the walls.  It really gives it a clean crisp look, which I really liked.  I made reservations under Open Table (which wasn't really necessary cuz there isn't a crazy line) but you get 100 points.

We were seated immediately eventhough we were fashionably late (which is like totally common in Las Vegas... right?).  Our server came and she was like totally authentic Chinese, which made me think, this place has to be good.  Also they are known for their freshly hand stretched noodles.  Our server comes and she talks really fast and really doesn't give me a chance to ask about their menu.  She just wanted me to order like NOW.  So I hate feeling rushed... I ask her to give her few minutes.

We ordered the pork chives fried dumpling and their combination chow mein which is their hand stretched noodles.  It took awhile, but when we got our food, the beef was clearly uncooked, which red and pinkness to it.  And because combination has pork, beef and chicken, we showed her and she apologized and took it back and brought it back fully cooked.  The pork chives fried dumplings were quite yummy and the chow mein was pretty good, but not like I was blown away good.

They have different pricing for \"Total Rewards\" members.  I'm sure if you are looking up this review, you are in Vegas and you know what I'm talking about.  If you don't, go make yourself a players club card.  Also when you show them the card when asking for the check, they also have the ability to apply any points or comps you have on your Total Rewards.  

It gave me satisfaction of eating chinese food, but like I said, I came to check out their unique decor."}
{"text":"Although the dishes are prepared adequately, the main gripe for this restaurant is that it's overly priced for its portions.  Plus, there are no pictures to help differentiate the items on the menu given some overlapping descriptions.  A small bowl of Sichuan Dan Dan noodles is almost $20 while 2 small pan-fried pork buns cost half that.  This place would be even more packed if it had reasonable prices especially for their dim sum menu.  

The service is fast, but not friendly or helpful in describing or recommending their menu items."}
{"text":"Being skeptical after seeing the bad rating on Yelp, we still decided to give it a try. It's actually pretty good! I see most of the bad reviews complained about overpricing, but it's Vegas, and it's a restaurant located inside a resort in Vegas! We can't expect Chinatown price over here. I think the price is reasonable and the food tastes good enough to match the price. Especially loved the Beijing style beef pancake, the duck meat fried rice, and the string beans with eggplants. The meat in the zha-jiang noodle was too salty but the noodle itself was decent. The place looks very clean and modern BTW."}

{"text":"This is a place where I greatly enjoy the food.  The atmosphere is very light. The staff is friendly.  The late night menu is limited, but before 12:30 PM there is an extensive menu.  I would like to see more day delicious noodle dishes with lamb, beef, or duck that are not soups"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Not a great dining experience. Atmosphere is like an employee dining room instead of a restaurant. Food is just ok."}
{"text":"Decent quality food and small portions. Upscale Chinese dining.   Great service and they do occasionally put on a show at the front when they make there special hand torn noodles. Would come again for a second visit but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good soups, shitty service. Possibly the worst service I have ever head. The hostess is more concern with her hair the actually taking care of costumers. The price is high as well for what you getting. It's a shame, because the food is actually tasty."}
{"text":"Average food from prior visits.  ROUGH servers.  Sitting at the Bar, called a server who is just STANDING to take my order.  \"You have to wait for the line\" when there's NO line!  Could have just get me order when he's doing nothing.  RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant tonight,  they were  not busy at 7.00pm. The hostess was very attentive and gave us a seat was  quiet
We ordered an appetizer which  looked like a small rolled taco with honey barbecue  Pork slices .The pork slices were over cooked and dry and did not have any flavor . The wrap was also overcooked. We then tried their fresh noodles with braised beef. This was a little better the beef again a little over cooked and did not have the same taste as we are used to .We then had their egg noodles with duck . The noodles were nice and fresh. However their were little to no vegables.  The server was attentive.  .but all together very disappointed"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance!!  Don't know why people are so hard on this place.  The food was good, we had chow mien and dumplings.  If you looking for a quick meal give this place a chance :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay.  I thought the service was great and the restaurant looked awesome.  However, we went here because it was supposed to be one of the cheaper restaurants and the quality didn't match the price.  I've had far better Chinese for less.  I realize it's Vegas, so it should be more expensive.. However, we went to Sushi Roku about 5 months ago, also at Caesars Palace, and spent about the same amount and it was far better food and a nicer looking restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there for a lunch but unfortunately the waiting was long. I loved the decoration of this restaurant but it somehow reduced the number of seats. Service was too slow but overall the food was good. I ordered Xiaolong bao and Lanzhou noodle. Price was high but this is Las Vegas so it's acceptable."}
{"text":"As a Chinese food expert, no one can ask for more in terms of service from any Chinese noodle restaurant. The service here is very familiar in terms of ALL Chinese noodle houses across the US, which is to say it is what it is. Food is actually quite good for a tourist location. Price is what I expect from Ceasars Palace. No five stars, but a good Chinese noodle house in a tourist location to make me feel like home."}
{"text":"Advise from someone who lived in Beijing for many years. Do not go. Expensive and not tasty. Not to mention bad service and 2hour wait time."}
{"text":"We ate here during restsurant week and had the four course meal for $50.11.  A portion of the procedes went to Three Square a vegas food bank.   This was the only saving grace, knowing we were doing some good.  The meal started with seafood soup, which was nothing special.  Next was cantonese style roast duck.  Not sure what cut of the bird this was, but it was mostly bone with a little meat.  It was served with cold marinated bamboo shoots.  These were interesting because i have never had them before, but again, nothing special.  The main course was scallops and asparagus.  I think the sauce was just oyster sauce, very salty and a little greasy, but the scallops were nicely cooked.  For dessert i had mango and pumalo in a mango custard.  This was pretty good.  Overall, the whole meal was just ok.  I have had way better meals for this price during restaurant week in the past.  Not sure how a mediocre chinese restaurant can stay in buisness in a city like Vegas with all the exceptional restaurant options.  Would not recomend.  Oh yeah, i should mention that i didn't choose the restaurant, we were with a group.  I wouldn't have chosen to come here in the first place, because why eat chinese food when you could have thai!?"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place but in the end it was a disappointment...Definitely have had better.....presentation is great, but over all taste is eh, bland and tasteless...AND really expensive!!!

We had chicken chow mein, won ton soup, dan dan noodles, and veggie fried rice. The hand pulled noodles are ok but I would not spend money on this place every again. Char sio bao is $10 for 3!!!!!! Are you serious?!?! In china town you can get 3 for 2 bucks! Serving size is definitely not like your normal Chinese restaurant. Therefore I suggest getting your own plate.

Service here sucks, and some waitresses speak very little English. 

The food comes out as it's cooked, so someone in your party might get their food last when everyone else is done with theirs. Not good!!!! You also have to be quick and attentive to them if and when they come around, otherwise they will take your plates away when your not even done! 

Hope your dining experience is better than mine was....."}
{"text":"Briefly, the food quality is definitely very good. The shredded duck with rice noodles and soup dumplings we had rivaled any Chinese restaurant here in Las Vegas. 

BUT, the prices at this establishment are far and away some of the most ridonkulous you'll pay for food that is usually very reasonably priced for the amount of deliciousness you get."}
{"text":"... Whattttt- This place is almost as big of a rip off as that Dragon Noodle place, however, this place tasted slightly better.

Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper. -_________- wtc. All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.

The Lai Mien (hand pulled noodles) wasn't bad, but after awhile it tastes redundant. It's a little bit on the chewy side for me too. There was a tiny piece of beef that came with my soup noodle, it was saddening.

I absolutely had nothing for the spicy cold noodles.

Their portions might look tiny but it's actually a pretty hefty serving. So do keep that in mind when you see the price.

But for $20/dish (on average), I would rather have a Subway sandwich, 4 times."}
{"text":"My sister and I dined here a while back and had a pretty satisfying meal. We loved the atmosphere with the thousands of goldfish surrounding you. My sister ordered the tomato and egg flower soup, which was okay, not great and we both got the eggplant noodles. These were delicious, the only problem being not nearly enough sauce. We would have asked for more, except for the server being non-existent until we were finished. It was a good place for lunch, the prices were decent for Las Vegas, especially since it was inside Ceasars. I would go again, and just ask for extra sauce before ordering."}
{"text":"OK service but they got several orders wrong in our group.  Small meat portions in their soup.  Shanghai Soup Dumplings were good."}
{"text":"Egregious. Travesty. Unmitigated gall. If I could give negative stars, I would. The restaurant is staffed with native Chinese servers and presumably cooks. Our server was rather disinterested and standoffish...I imagine it is because she was embarrassed to be associated with such a place and the blatant cash grab that it is. 

I have to admit we did not hit it at peak time...it was about 3:30 pm and the place was mostly empty. However, we had just checked in after a tiring day of travel, so at least it was conveniently in the hotel. We also did not get any noodles, though they were being stretched in front of us...I wish we did. The little one usually likes congee, so we chose the congee with century egg and pork ($15!!). Now, I absolutely cannot resist XLB anytime I see them on a menu (even though they are Shanghainese in origin and this was presumably a Beijing restaurant...they also had DanDan noodles, a Szechuan treat. We got the regular pork XLB ($14!) and seafood/pork XLB ($14!). We finished the ordering with some Shiu Mai ($12!), and a $5 diet coke!!! OK, so I thought the prices were rather high (understatement). But I felt the same way at Yank Sing in SF, but at least the food was really good and I didn't feel robbed.

The congee was made from water, not broth, bits of century egg, and a smattering of pork strips. There was nary any salt nor any seasonings of any sort. As a result, it was devoid of any flavor (surprise, surprise). $15 for raw ingredients totalling 25 cents. Both varieties of XLB were off as well...though they both had ample soup, the skins were very tough and discolored a dark hue, as if they had been sitting out awhile. The filling was surprising tough and chewy as well. The four shiu mai were fine, though at $3 a pop, you'd think they had foie gras or truffles in them. Really, nothing different from the 50 to 75 cent version you'd find in any Chinatown. However, the meal was salvaged by the best diet coke I'd ever had, definitely a bargain at $5. Did you catch the sarcasm there? 'cause I was laying it on pretty thick.

So, the total damage for a very mediocre (actually, the food was aspiring to become mediocre) meal was just about $75(!!!). Really, no kidding. Pretty incredible. Run as fast as you can away from this place."}
{"text":"service sucks and the food sucks. I don't recommend this restaurant at all. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok my take on this restaurant or any Asian restaurant... I don't like any Asian restaurant in the casinos. They are too expensive and the portions are too small. Done no more coming here better to go to Chinatown at less it's cheaper and the portions are bigger and it's more authentic"}
{"text":"If you are looking for real Chinese food this is the place. This isn't pf changs - it uber authentic. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Spicy perfection."}
{"text":"DO NOT BE FOOLED BY EXTREMELY HOT HOSTESS. 

Food was mediocre at best. Ive had better at fast food Chinese joints. I ordered sauteed noodles with beef which was just $18 lo mein. Best thing was my thai tea."}
{"text":"Now dis is a cool place 2 chill, eat, hang out N stuff. Food is BomB interior is off da hook. Classy. Elegant. & Hip. This place is now on da must return spot every time in Vegas. Every time..."}
{"text":"The interior decor is beautiful. I really liked the ambiance of this place. 
I like the fact that you can watch them hand pull noodles towards the front of the restaurant by the entrance. They also have several fish tanks that adds a splash of vibrant color from the otherwise contrasting white decor.

The food is freshly prepared, but overpriced compared to your typical Chinese restaurant, but what isn't in Vegas? 

They have a rather extensive menu to entice just about anyone. 
-Lead by Executive Chef Li Yu. -Attire is casual. -Average price of an entree is approximately $25. 

These are the following dishes I've ordered at Beijing Noodle No.9: (2 adults, 2 children) Ordered far too much. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs..evidently.

-Special Seafood Soup (one size) $113.99/ individual bowl. (The flavors were very \"clean\", but too bland in my opinion.)

-Braised Sea Bass in a sizzling clay pot $23.99 

-Walnut Prawns in Mayo Sauce $20.99 (I actually really enjoyed this dish, the prawns were huge, fried to perfection, and absolutely succulent.) 

-Beef Chow Fun $16.99

-Braised Beef Brisket & Tendon Noodle Soup $16.99 (you can choose what kind of noodle to have it with. I opted for the more traditional choice for this dish; hand pulled/ stretched noodles.)

-War Wonton Noodle Soup $16.99 (This was a very ordinary dish that I wouldn't order again.)

-Green Onion Pancake $7.99 (I requested for it to be extra crispy which was delightful.)

-Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings Pork (6 pieces) $12.99 (I definitely prefer Din Tai Fung's XLB) 

-Pork and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $10.99 

-Shrimp and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $12.99 (I opted for Pan Fried for both orders.) 

-Seafood & Egg White Fried Rice $16.99 (Ordered this in lieu of white rice, it complemented the other dishes very well)

-Seasonal Mushrooms w. Black Pepper Sauce $15.99 (I was quite disappointed when this came out with mainly white mushroom.) 

-Pea Leaves w. Golden Garlic $19.99 (Paired well with the fried rice mentioned above.) 

-4 Thai Iced Teas $6.99 each, we added boba (bubble, pearls etc.) but I forget how much extra they charged. 

-Sichuan Dan Dan Mien $15.99 (I believe we ordered this with the knife-shredded noodles to change it up a bit.) 

-Beijing Pancake Wrap with Cilantro (1) (Beef or Honey BBQ Pork) $8.99 (We opted for Beef, and if I remember correctly we all enjoyed it.)

I know I'm missing a few dishes, but I think it's safe to say that I pretty much ordered something from each section/ category on the menu. We ate \"family style\" and shared so everyone gets more choices, making this review easier. The food portions were fair, the food didn't taste bad, but it was more Americanized to be completely honest. I can see why the reviews for this restaurant is all over the place; it is overpriced, and didn't taste necessarily \"authentic\". 

Service wise: We were seated quickly, and the servers were friendly and attentive. 

Overall, it's a nice concept, but not a restaurant I'd ever crave. I do agree with other reviews that it's overpriced, but again, we are talking about Vegas. Everything is overpriced in Vegas.. maybe we're paying for the experience. Will I return, possibly, but it wouldn't be my choice. I'd go if someone else wanted to eat there. Personally, I'd rather eat at Bacchanal Buffet next door because there's definitely something for everyone, at one set price."}
{"text":"Definitely nothing compared to San Gabriel Valley quality in taste, but the decor and presentation is definitely worth visiting for.  The display of noodle chefs handmaking the noodles is definitely fun to watch.  The downside is the flavor of the dishes.  A little too bland for my pallet, and I usually like things on the last salty side too!

I'd think twice before coming here to eat, but definitely walk buy for the awesome decor and large tanks of goldfishes."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've ever had. My wife and I have eaten here before and everything was great. We were seeing a concert at Caesars so we wanted to eat there also. What a bad idea that was. It started with no condiment tray(soy,chili etc..). Ordered drinks and appetizer - drinks came but no appetizer. Ordered entrée and told waiter we never got our appetizer. They showed up after our entrée. My wife took a condiment tray off an empty table. Never saw the waiter again. We wanted another drink and I wanted water. He did show up to give us the check of course. Won't ever go back - to many great restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and average. I would go somewhere else for better Chinese food. Plus the service is pretty slow and bad here. Didn't ask us for water or tea. The reception girl has a b face and it looks like she is using the restaurant as her catwalk."}
{"text":"By far the WORST Chinese restaurant I've been to. The food was tasteless and bland. The servers were rude. We ordered hainan chicken and the server did not tell us they were out of hainan chicken until all of our food had already been served. The server came over to inform us they were out of the hainan chicken and was not the least bit apologetic. Will NEVER return. We should have just waited in the 2 hour line for the buffet."}
{"text":"This place is by far the most pricey Chinese restaurant I've ever been... 1st, no matter if you get spicy chicken cube or whatever - they charge you extra for a small rice. You order 1 tea which comes in a small pot with 1 cup. Asked for another cup to share my pot - my server's response was 2.00 extra for the cup. So, I said - this is ridiculous! My server's response was, \"this is Vegas!!\" As if that makes it all better to financially rape your customers. 

Noodle soup - noodle portion is very small, and tastes just okay. 
Spicy Fish - Really good."}
{"text":"OMG this has got to be the worst food I have ever tasted in Vegas and I've been to Vegas  so many times. The Kung Pao chicken with peanuts wasn't even chicken as you don't even know what this meat was it was a weird texture and not tasty at all. 
We also had some noodles which was disgusting absolutely disgusting did notbraste like any noodles we ever had. And shrimp fried rice, the rice wasn't even fried it was like soft and the shrimp wasn't even cooked it was like raw shrimp from a shrimp cocktail so nasty. 

SHAME ON YOU CESEARS PALACE for allowing this establishment on your property. Maybe you should take some notes from the MGM properties. We had no choice but to go to this place because all the good restaurants at Caesar's Palace we're closed from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. how inconvenient is that!"}
{"text":"Saw the sign of a man pulling noodles at the LAS Airport and was sold! Little did I know you have to come to this place with some focus.

The +'s:
+ Noodles did taste extra chewy which is the way I like it. Al dente. It's their forte and I enjoyed my small order (feeds 2 girls easily) to share. Friends ordered the dao xiao (handcut) noodles with egg and tomato--I liked that the best.
+ Jimmy our waiter was cordial and funny. He helped the lost ones at our table to make their decisions.  His recommendations satisfied us.
+ Service is quick. We ordered, ate, paid and left all at a reasonable pace.
+ Decor is fanciful. Think modern white but lots of curly Qs and glass tanks of goldfish swirling everywhere around you. It's dizzying but fantastical!

The -'s:
- Forget the dimsum or sides. The prices first of all are ridiculous.
- Again a minus is that the prices were high in general!
- The decor can work against you if you're prone to vertigo. Dramamine maybe should be an appetizer.

Overall I'd come back if I were just dying for noodles and to catch the guy making the noodles. I wouldn't go outta my way for the place though."}
{"text":"We should have checked yelp, but opted to trust the guy checking us into Caesar's Palace. He said we absolutely HAD to go here (maybe because we're asian?!)...so my husband had it on his places to eat radar. For about $22 a bowl of noodles, you'd expect a little more than what you'd get at a lil mom and pop. However, my bowl came with 2 wontons and about 2 stalks of vegetables. So dissatisfying in so many ways. I could have gotten something way better anywhere else in the casino!"}
{"text":"Located in Caesar's Palace, this place always seems to be busy.  My husband and I decided to check it out for lunch and there was a 30 minute wait at 1pm.  We decided it must be worth it, and 30 minutes later, we were seated. The entrance is lined with fish tanks FILLED with Goldfish and the rest of the decor is very trendy, hipster, China.  The tables are a bit close together, but comfortable.  I ordered the Hand stretched noodles with pork and veggies.  It was awesome, as was my husband's review of his cold (also hand stretched) noodles with beef and veggies.  My only complaint was the extra 20 minutes we waited AFTER we were finished eating, to get our check.  I finally had to flag down another waitress and ask her to get ours.  The table beside us had to do the same for drink refills."}
{"text":"It's very very very bland. I'm speechless at how mediocre the food is here. The noodles are indeed hand made and taste very fresh but there is almost zero flavor with any of the food they offered in their large menu. And I'm not some white dude judging Eastern food from a Western palate. I love Chinese food. At it's worst, Chinese food can at least be salty. This food lacked anything. It was like eating nothing. They brought out sriracha and everyone at our table used copious amounts of it to add anything to it.

We had a large group of 9 people and shared a big table with a lazy Susan and were sampling a lot of things. 

The soups, the plates of varying kinds of chicken and beef offerings, it was extremely bland. I've never had Chinese food not taste like anything. It was like eating air.

The goldfish tanks are neat. Just don't eat."}
{"text":"We were at the Palace and came upon this place. As we were looking at the menu at the host desk a guy walks up and says this place is very good he was just here yesterday. So we figured \"why not\". We ordered Beef Chow Fun, my husband loves chow fun and always orders it at Chinese restaurants. Kung Pao Chicken, I always love trying it at different places. And BBQ Pork. The prices were pretty high..but we were hungry. 

BBQ pork was around 17.99 for 8 slices. Expensive, but it was delicious!! 

Kung Pao was about 16.99 a pretty decent amount of food for two people. But we didn't like it at all. It wasn't spicy to us, but they use way too much ginger. I felt like I was eating ginger chicken. I would not order again.

Beef Chow Fun..I don't remember price, but it was plenty to feed the two of us. It didn't have much flavor. The beef was bland, but not dry. The noodles didn't have much flavor. Sadly we had to add some soy sauce to give it some more flavor.

We ordered one side of rice 3.99

The water glass I got was dirty. I'm sure it went through the dishwasher, but the pervious drink must have left a dark residue. It looked like it just needed to be popped back in the dish washer, I don't think anyone deliberately gave me a used dirty glass.

Our bill for the two of us was around $67. Pricy for those 4 item.

I would go back, but try one of their noodle soup instead. Of the items we got, I don't think we will be ordering them again...well except maybe the BBQ pork."}
{"text":"I came in.  No idea what to do. I ordered and had the nerve to ask for rice or noodles.   She said Rice ok.  No noodle.ibdont know how it works but waitress less than helpful m"}
{"text":"Had two meals here and both were excellent and cooked to order. The noodles were delicious and the beef was of high does have the fat on it because this authentic Chinese noodle shop so he food is prepared the same as it would if you'd ordered it in China."}
{"text":"Came here and had pork sticky bun and BBQ pork noodle soup. The bun was ok but meat tasted old and the soup was cold. Kinda expect more for the price and with so many places in Vegas to try, don't think this is a place to return"}
{"text":"Well done interior, fresh ingredients, good service--but the food was oddly bland.  I wanted authentic and fresh flavors and was pretty stunned by the blandness.  The oft mentioned special noodles with pork were just ok."}
{"text":"Foods ok. Service sucks! So many servers and none come to help out. Hostess was to busy texting to acknowledge us until the photographer told her she had people."}
{"text":"Well the only thing I like about this place is the design of this bright and modern style restaurant. For food was meh not so much, I had a lot better Chinese food so this one was okay. The server was nice with care."}
{"text":"First time here and I was extremely impressed with their hospitality.  The wait was about 20 minutes and while we waited the hostess came around and offered us cold water bottles to quench our thirst.  Once seated our waiter was quick to take our order and served our drinks promptly. The ambience was enjoyable and our food was served within minutes.  The only down side is the portions are small but overall great service!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decoration, BAD service, OVER-RATED price. $60 for 2 people. What a rip-off! Hah-Gow was $8 for 4 pieces. I could have gone to Dim Sum and had it with 16 pieces. Hai nan chicken rice was $18 which my God-dad made it better than them. Every main course was $18 at least. Never had such expensive CHINESE food. It would be my first time and last time also."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Fast food quality at 5 diamond pricing, and half the menu was not available, boo! Do not order the chow mein, very greasy and bland. their salt & pepper shrimp was ok and bbq pork pancake wrap was edible, but everything else was gross and very pricey!"}
{"text":"really good food here, it does not look like much, and the wait always seems to be long, but when inside the food is pretty good. one of the \"cheaper\" places to eat in this hotel. very bright inside also, i found the looks to be kind of what ever. smaller place, the service was good, and the food was served hot and tasted fresh. we did order all kinds of stuff from the vast menu and we were happy with it. they dont give you a lot of food, for a Chinese place, but what they do give you is good. price was kind of on the higher side for Chinese food, but then its in this hotel it was less $ than other places. i would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"This place was ethereally beautiful, classy, relaxing and zen like. Hit them up after absinthe late one night around 9-10 I believe and were the last ones in. Very kind servers and delish noodles. Had the Sichuan Dan Dan mein."}
{"text":"I've eaten here the past three visits to Las Vegas will continue to dine at Beijing Noodle No. 9 on every Vegas trip.  Prices are reasonable, especially if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything has been outstanding, from the food, to the service, to the ambiance.  The hand stretched noodles are to die for!  Best Chinese food I've ever had!  Don't miss:
   Noodles with Tomato and Egg Sauce
   Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce
   Sautéed Prime Sirloin with String Beans"}
{"text":"This review is for the Dim Sum portion of the menu.  Although the noodles are their signature, as evidenced by the name, I never tired them.  I was much more interested in the Dim Sum. Beijing Noodle doesn't have the cart service that makes Dim Sum more of an experience than a meal, but I was happy enough to just order my favorite dishes.  It is Vegas priced (expensive), and slow (because they are making the dishes to order) so minus a star there.

The scallion pancake was crispy and hot with lots of scallion flavor.
I love anything with the pink, sweet, bbq pork filling - the steamed buns and the flaky baked pastry were both good.
They offer steamed or pan fried dumplings with various fillings. Just be careful that they are giving you what you ordered - the servers kept giving my dumplings to the table next to me and vice versa (minus a star for that).  The steamed dumpling were kind of soggy, but the pan fried were quite good.

Make sure to take some time to watch the noodles being made by hand at the little window in the front of the shop - it's quite a show.

I also loved that they had Thai iced tea and coffee - brewed strong and mixed with sweetened condensed milk - one of my favorite drinks ever since those late nights out in college. And I loved the eye-catching design of the place, with its stark white patterned walls, and huge fishtanks - really different, and really cool."}
{"text":"Located on the main ground floor of Caesar's Casino, close to the registration desk. The restaurant features very extensive selection of traditional Chinese dishes, including large selection of noodles-based dishes. When you order food, you get a choice of using pre-made noodles, or asking for the noodles freshly made right in front of your eyes - similar bad experience as traditional sushi restaurant. I had seafood noodle soup  Shangai style, and it was delicious - perfect amount of spice, not too salty, flavorful broth, honest amound of seafood with fresh shrimp and scallops. Also had a selection of Mochi for dessert - delicious, especially the red bean (vanilla and green tea were excellent too). All in all, excellent meal at a very reasonable price for the prime Las Vegas casino. 
Friendly and helpful service. 
Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food to me was a bit of a let down. I've always wanted hand pulled noodles but it didn't taste that great to me."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for what you get!  The decor of the restaurant was sleek and modern, the service was subpar and the food was average at best.  I tried the beef chow fun and for the price I would have expected a much better lunch."}
{"text":"This place was not bad but I don't think it is a a definite must go to place. One of the things it has going for it is the location and decor. I think the goldfish tank/ sorta like a wall fixture is neat, but i felt kinda weird eating and seeing all the goldfish all over the place. I cant explain it, just something about it , maybe they didn't need quite so much, but then that would take away from the effect right?

I will agree that the noodles are better than your average lo mien, they are fresher and just taste different but again, nothing spectacular.

Besides the too many goldfish in my face when I'm trying to eat my food, the decor was really nice, very clean and modern."}
{"text":"We went to No. 9, thinking  it was going to really be at least a 4 star experience. We get to the restaurant and there is no host/hostess. I have to find someone to take our order. I will say, once we ordered it didn't take long for our food to come. I ordered the \"Chicken Lo Mein\". When I tell you I had about 8 quarter size pieces of chicken and that was it. You also need to ask for extra seasoning, because does have any flavor unless you ask for extra spices."}
{"text":"Food is great here. 
I had the soup dumplings that were really good. I also ordered a noodle soup which was amazing. My parents ordered a second order to bring up to their room they liked it so much. 

What brings it down to 3 stars only? The staff was horrendous. Not just one person but everyone involved. 

The restaurant was quiet when we arrived. Yet, the hostess made everyone wait for tables (empty ones that she later sat them at anyways). 

My parents are 7 Star (aka they usually get to skip the lines) and she told us that she'd sit us next, nope, she didn't. She sat others next, which was fine if they didn't wait forever also to be seated.

She often disappeared into the restaurant and customers were just waiting outside like, \"Where the hell did she go?\"  

Then when we sat down, the waiter wasn't too polite either. He sometimes talked back to my parents just because my mom wanted to make sure he used the hand pull noodles and not the other kind. He replied with, \"WELL DUH.\" Um thanks dude.

I often give staff the benefit of the doubt but I wouldn't return to here especially when there are SO many options in Vegas especially inside Caesars alone. And much better staff elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ate here while I was at a conference this year.  I sat at the noodle bar and it was very cool watching them make the noodles!  Unfortunately, that was the coolest part.  I got the beef brisket noodle bowl.  The pieces of beef were so big I had to take them out of the bowl and cut them with a knife and fork.  At first, that may seem like a good thing, but I also had to cut them in to small enough bites that I could chew on it for about 30 seconds to render the chewy fat stuck to every piece.  The noodles were really good... and maybe I'm just not cultured enough to know how to eat them, lol.  I was using chopsticks but the noodles were so long, I had to bite them and let them fall back into the bowl which resulted in a nice splash that spotted my dress shirt.  If the noodle was short enough to slurp into my mouth, it whipped a nice stream of broth across my face to wipe off.  Needless to say, it didn't even cost me any money personally because it was on my company's dime and it still gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"We love this place the entrance has a hallway of goldfish.  We always get the soup dumplings  and we both had the Dan Dan noodles. They are very spicy and so good."}
{"text":"The interior is 5 stars - very gorgeous floral design in what looks like enameled cast iron. I also love the goldfish tanks at the front of the restaurant. 

The service, 4 stars - we had a very gracious and attentive server who allowed our party of 7 to split our bill without any hassle. 

The food is 3 star, on its own - definitely not bad tasting food, but realize that you'll be paying $16-$20+ for an entree that, for the exact same order, would run you $6-$8 in an off-strip restaurant. I'm okay occasionally paying more if I see an increase in quality; for Beijing Noodle, this is not the case. 

I had the Yangzhou Style Fried Rice (Shrimp, diced Ham, diced carrots, peas, $17) and the Singapore Style Rice Noodles (Shrimp, diced BBQ pork, scant bean sprouts, a few shreds of julienned bell pepper, $17). They were average, but edible, and on-table soy sauce and sambal oelek were welcome spices. 

The wait, 1 star - we stood in line for 40+ minutes on NYE, which I guess is standard (? - I don't think so...), but they also will move any VIP's to the front of the line, of which there were many the night we came, lengthening our total wait. 

The cross-contamination of food items, 1 star - beware that because they make wheat noodles fresh in house, it's almost impossible to avoid allergen contamination with non-wheat items. If you are gluten-free or gluten intolerant, you're gonna have a bad time, which I did less than an hour after eating at this location (a reaction so severe it mimicked food poisoning). My bad.  

Won't be returning here in the future. Better (and safer) eats elsewhere."}
{"text":"food was good (had the lan zhou with hand-stretched noodles): didn't change my life, but was good.  the dumplings at the next table over looked good as well.  service was infrequent; they seemed to be understaffed since there were plenty of open seats but still a line at the door.  

not sure how they'd do with large parties, but if you're looking for calories after the morning after I definitely recommend it..."}
{"text":"8 of us just finished eating here.  Service was very friendly, prices were definitely reasonable, and we all really enjoyed our meals. 

I would come back again for sure!

Unfortunately I didn't snap any photos of our food, but here are a few of the place."}
{"text":"Poor service and WAY OVERPRICED Chinese food!! Almost took 20 minutes to have our orders taken and be served some water! On top of that portions are SUPER SMALL and food is only mediocre. We ordered the Dan Dan mein, BBQ pork pancake wrap, and XLB with our bill totaling $48.00 (if you use your Total Rewards player's card they take a few dollars off your total FYI!). 

The only thing worth coming here to try is their BBQ Pork pancake wrap!! It was so tasty it didn't even require sauce! It was decently sized as well and we literally killed it within seconds!! Their Dan Dan mein was TOO SALTY and tasted like ramen noodles with a dry sauce packet over it.. Not too appetizing to say the least! Their XLB wasn't all that great either as the skin was too thick and there wasn't enough soup within the dumpling itself. It tasted pretty bland when eaten alone and when combined with the side sauce (vinegar plus ginger) it was decent--nothing out of the ordinary though. 

Venue was nice and everyone from servers to wait staff were dressed in traditional Chinese attire so it gave an upscale vibe to the restaurant. It was hard to find at first since it's hidden in a corner near the circle bar within Caesar's Palace--right before the Bacchanal buffet. 

Overall, probably won't be coming back here again, if I'm ever craving really good Chinese food I'll probably venture out to Chinatown which is only a few miles away!"}
{"text":"Service varies depending on what shift you encounter. The seats located at the counter overlooking the boiling waters ready in anticipation for those fresh hand stretched noodles are great for a quick dine-in with free entertainment. The restaurant pulls fresh noodles during brunch/lunch hours so there won't be too much of a show at night. 

The food varies. If you're looking for authenticity, you may want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for good ol' American Chinese food, you've hit the jackpot. As someone who grew up in Beijing with Beijing comfort food as our nightly menu; take it from me, the food produced here is far from China quality. However, they (the restaurant) has well executed the concept of Beijing-style food and caters to satisfying American taste buds. 

Case and point? We ate at Beijin Noodle four consecutive days for lunch and dinner. At each meal, American's mostly ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Shrimp. Chinese don't really eat those dishes. Maybe American Chinese, but not Chinese from China. 

You're probably asking why we even ate there so many time in a row if the food was only \"meh.\" Well, they had one particular dish that reminded me of grammy's cooking - sliced potatoes.  Each day I asked them to add ja tsai to the dish the way my grams did, and each time I ate the dish it nearly brought me to tears reminiscing of my 4' 3\" nai nai. 

So because of that one Beijing-style dish, I went nearly the entire time I stayed in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would give negative star if I could! This place just want to rob you! We came here 9:30am planning to have breakfast. We looked at the menu on the touch screen. Even though the price is a little pricey ( $15.99 for the fish congee, we have a baby), we decided to go in. Once we sat down, the waitress handed us a \"Late night menu\". Found out the price became $21 for the same thing ! A bowl of plain congee cost $15.99!! REALLY???!!! 9:30am is LATE NIGHT?? REALLY????
Feel like they are trying to scam people , especially if you don't look at the menu carefully and if you don't know Chinese food! 
Read the other reviews and don't think their food is good!!
We left!!"}
{"text":"We love this place and stop in every time we are in Vegas!   Sea bass in the clay pot was amazing.  Great noodles too!"}
{"text":"Christopher (maybe a manager?) is very vigilant and attentive. He walks around checking to make sure everything is going well and the customers are happy."}
{"text":"When I \"checked into\" this place and saw the average of 2 1/2 stars, I was thinking, yikes...this is going to be interesting.

But honestly, aside from the prices being so expensive, the food was actually delicious. Our orders arrived pretty fast...within 7-10 minutes after we placed our orders and there were still a lot of people at the restaurant. 
My friend and I ordered pan-fried pork and chives dumpllings (6) as an appetizer and it was so delicious, I could've ordered 2 plates as my entree.

For my entree, I ordered the Singapore-styled noodles with shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Yes, the portions may be small for the average men, but for females...you will have leftovers if not, the perfect sized. My friend said her entree was delicious as well.

The reason why I gave my review 4 stars versus 5 is because I do agree with the other reviews....the price for what you get can get some people upset. Or feel like they got cheated out on.  But if money wasn't an issue for you, if you have any food & beverage credits or anything similar like that....this would be a great place to dine at here at Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"While Beijing boasts the work of an incredible interior design team, (four massive tanks completely filled with goldfish, contemporary furniture, etc.) the actual food and service are subpar on a nuclear level. As someone who considers herself an expert on true Chinese-Vietnamese cuisine, Beijing Noodle No. 9 embarrassed me! 
I ordered the cold noodles with cucumber, beansprouts, and beef. What I got was half-cooked, starchy udon-like noodles doused in spicy, watery, mock-szechuan sauce, dehydrated shreds of cucumber, and beef jerky. 
YES - they gave me beef jerky. They actually gave me beef jerky with my noodles. 
My family ordered variations of the wonton soup because hey, how could you ever mess up wonton soup? Surprise! This place managed to! The soup was obviously made from cheap starch and the noodles had a little more flavor than computer paper. Also, the price range is ridiculous - a bowl of noodles goes from $12 - $22, which is a jaw-dropping difference with authentic places that stay below the $10 mark. It's depressing. And that is where I will end my review on this one. 
In the words of my dear father and his experience with Beijing Noodle No. 9: 
\"I hate white people noodles. I want Asian people noodles.\" 
Just no. Never again. I would rather eat paper towels than return to this wretched place."}
{"text":"On any other day I'd probably give this place a 3.5 but I'm feeling generous.

They seated our group of 7 right away, service was fast, and the food was solid. The wait staff and kitchen staff are mainly Chinese (something I look for at a Chinese establishment).

The wall decor and fish tanks are a little trippy and distracting.

Prices are okay, considering you're in Vegas. Make sure you bring your Total Rewards card for discounted pricing.

Dishes I liked:
Green onion pancake
Spicy cubed chicken
Congee w/ thousand year old egg and pork

Dishes that were decent:
Beef brisket noodle soup
Hainanese chicken and rice"}
{"text":"As you would expect from a place as ornate as Caesar's Palace, this has to be the prettiest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' \"THX 1138\" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. 

Yet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. 

The scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips. 

FOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination 
AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish 
SERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face? 
TOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smile"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch. Poor service, blow average food. Only cool thing is the interior."}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food.  Not really the quality I expected from a place inside the Caesar Palace.   The food is pretty much tasteless.  Great ambiance unfortunately, that is what you are paying for. My advice, try something else. Great if you never had good Chinese before.  I have had Chine fast food that tastes better then this."}
{"text":"I'm...actually really surprised at the rating for this place. Yes, it's HELLA EXPENSIVE for chinese food ($20 for a bowl of noodles? wtf....I get that for $5 in the 626) but the food itself is not bad. 

Zha jiang mian was full of toppings and the noodles were delicious. My only complaint was that the meat was too salty but meh...whatevers.

And just fyi, tea is $4 a person. SO DRINK UP if you get tea. We were so confused at first when we got the bill...haha"}
{"text":"Was enjoying my beef brisket noodle soup while reading the news when something below caught my eye.  Right in front of the noodle bar (where they make the noodle) I see a cricket stuck in the little case in front of the noodle bar.  I felt bad because the poor thing couldn't get out.  Definitely stopped eating the noodles & told my server."}
{"text":"I was heading next door to the buffet when I caught the guy making noodles in the window. I watched him for a while, wondering if I should go there instead of the buffet. But I headed around the corner anyway. I saw the line for the buffet and immediately turned around to try those noodles. 

Honestly I'm surprised by the bad reviews. I was a party of 1, and sat at the back bar. I ordered the Cold noodles with cucumber and beef. It came with a quite spicy peanut sauce (if you don't like spicy, this isn't for you).  I also ordered the Xiao Long Bao. 

Xiao Long Bao were average. Which is fine. I enjoyed them and would order them again. I do love Xiao Long Bao.

But the noodles. Wow, never had a noodle like that in my life. It was a beautiful thing. The guy making the noodles is an artist. Amazing texture and so so fresh. I've never had any noodle like that and I LOVE noodles. I wish I could find something like that here in my home town of Chicago. If you like spicy food, I would recommend the cold noodles. A thing of beauty. Really. I loved it."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Service, ehh. But the food was pretty good. We actually had to come back because they only serve hand pulled noodles after 11 am. They really should have advised us of that before we were seated. We left and came back. Upon our return we were advised that they could seat us but we would need to be done eating by a certain time because they had a large party coming in. We quickly placed our orders. The soup dumplings were ok. The beef brisket with hand pulled noodles was delicious. The Beijing wontons in chicken broth was a little on the bland side. The chow mein was also very good. We ordered a few other dishes, I can't remember but they didn't stand out. Overall not a bad place. Quite satisfying, especially if your in the mood for some decent chinese food without venturing off the strip into Chinatown. Prices are what can be expected in a casino in las vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of all noodles, dumplings and baos and after hearings our friend's positive reviews, whom is originally from Beijing, I had to try their hand-pulled noodles...   

We arrived at 4:30pm this past Sunday with only a 2 people party in front of us.  The hostess took my name down and said it'll be a 10 minute wait.  However, the restaurant was half empty with plenty of wait staff walking around and casually cleaning up.  While we are wondering why we needed to wait, our hostess was chatting it up with another hostess playing with their purses on the podium/table right in front of us.  After 15 minutes, we were finally walked to our table.  We ordered Dandan noodles, pan fried pork buns and mango pomelo sago.  The food arrived relatively quick.  The pork buns were nice and hot and was great with vinegar; the noodles were just average with minimal sauce but the dessert was quite poor with powdery tapioca.  

Overall, the food was just ok especially at their prices.  We definitely will not come back nor would we recommend this place to our friends because of their poor customer service.  None of the staff gave us a smile and we really don't like establishments that try to make themselves look busy when they aren't.   I have to say  it's a good change of pace from the other restaurants inside Casears Palace and a good back up for Bacchanal's crazy long lines but if you don't make your guests feel welcomed, it doesn't matter how \"authentic\" your food is."}
{"text":"Is this the *real* Caesar's palace?

2.5 stars for Beijing Noodle No. 9.  We had a later (2pm? 2:30?) lunch on Sunday while making our way from the Venetian back to Mandalay Bay.  My BF had been putting up with my its-my-first-time-in-vegas-i-need-to-eat-only-the-best phase (sorry, honey!) and woke up Sunday morning with a taste for peanut noodles.  This man LOVES peanut sauce.  And when he craves it, it's like my bad sushi cravings, I want to get this man some peanut noodles!!!

So, I find Beijing Noodle whatever in the Vegas TO GO book and we decide we will stop there for lunch.  I should've tried to find a menu first.  

When we finally got there, we opted to sit at the noodle bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table, because we were both starving by that point.  It was fun to watch the chef hand stretch the noodles, and I told my BF, look! they're hand stretched, they're going to be so delicious!!

Plusses
+ Hand stretched noodles were indeed delish.  I had the mushroom/pork sauce.  It should've been called mushroom/egg sauce with hints of pork, and I had to add chili sauce (available at the bar, assumingly for a reason :P) but the noodles had good texture.

Minuses
- no peanut noodles.  the BF had chow mein, which he said he enjoyed, but was sad there was no option for him to have hand-stretched.
- service was sluggish and disinterested.

Next time we are in Vegas, we'll try one of the other casual places to find my man some peanut noodles!"}
{"text":"Despite all the negative reviews listed on here, the food is actually very fresh and tasty. This is my fourth visit to Beijing Noodle, and I was very pleased. 

We ordered the BBQ Pork, Beef Chow Fun, Pea Leaves with Garlic, and the Salt and Pepper Prawns. The prawns were outstanding, large, crispy, and flavorful. Everything else was also spot on. 

The manager seemed eager to please us, perhaps because we had to wait way longer than he had quoted us (hence the 1 star dock), and made sure to bring us drinks very quickly. 

All-in-all, the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"So we ended up here after realizing the buffet next door wasn't seating anyone anymore. They quoted us a 2 hour wait for a party of 10, which seemed a little much, but since we were playing anyway, we didn't mind much. The only downside is, that since we had gone to eat a family dinner at the buffet, my sister was there with her 2 babies. There wasn't really anywhere for her to wait with the kids near the restaurants, and anywhere she tried to sit, the security would tell her she couldn't be doing that.

When we were seated, we sat to the side of the goldfish. Ordered a few of the dim sum items, appetizers, noodles, and a dish with lobster that I can't remember. Everything tasted alright. I was a little disappointed with the soup dumpling, since the soup seemed a little bland, but it wasn't bad. The pork belly appetizer that I was excited for was served cold, which we weren't expecting. It was a little weird, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.

Our waiter was awesome though! He was fun and addressed any issues we had right away, even offered to take back the pork belly, but we kept it since my sister was into it. Not sure if I would come back here, since I think we ended up spending around the same amount t we would've at the buffet."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" pretty much says it all. And not even a cheap \"meh\" at that. Kinda cool atmosphere, high prices, unexceptional food and passable service. Why bother?"}
{"text":"We came with four people and got many dishes to share. Noodle bowls were sub par. I mean... We expected much more for a swanky place. Definitely over priced. The pork WAS flavorful and tender but the noodles were a bad undercooked texture, the pork buns were obviously left in a proofer because they were soggy outside, and the fried rice was bland. The beef pancake WAS good, but not good enough for a better rating. Interior is cool and takes you away from the casino. Service was on par."}
{"text":"It's so rare after the age of 15 to find something you would genuinely define as a fascinating flavor.  The Dan Dan Noodles with Numbing Spicy Sauce at Beijing Noodle No.9 is exactly that.  It's not numbing in the way that you would expect from some Dave's Insanity Sauce crap.  It makes your tongue tingle in a fantastic, citrus-y kind of way.  It's a completely new flavor, which, for somebody who's been eating for 40 years, is a treat.  Soup dumplings and shrimp siu mai, and mochi are also delicious.  Not too pricey either."}
{"text":"Review # 36/100 yelp challenge

* Price: expensive but big portion. $16 for a bowl of soup, $18 for fried rice. 3 star.
* Ambiance: nice decor but casual. 3 star.
* Location: Casear Palace Casino. Easy to access and free parking in Colisseum way. 4 star.
* Meals: not bad. The flavor is more mild than Chinese dishes in chinatown but presentation is lacking. 3 star.
* Service: pleasant; food coming out very fast. 3+ star.

Averaged to about 3 star.

After a long night, we just wanted to have a bowl of soup! We came here even though they have many bad reviews but they also have good reviews from the yelp elite folks... So we tried it out.
We got seated right away. The severs came to get our order right away, drinks and meals coming at fast pace. 
We ordered Lanzhou beef soup, beef brisket soup and shrimp fried rice.
- Lanzhou beef soup with hand pulled noodle: thick-base broth with anise, peppercorn and cinnamon. The noodle is hand-pulled so it maybe chewy. Overall, it is tasty but not spicy as traditional Lanzhou noodles.
- beef brisket soup: pretty good. It is spicy, thick stew beef stock. 
- fried rice: light flavor, perfectly cooked fried rice.

Overall, food is decent (not comparing to restaurants in LA, SF or NY Chinatowns) but pricey! Food presentation is lacking. However, it opens 24/7 and offers decent comfort food, we just have to bite the bullet!"}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed in the food! ...and the amount of food provided for the price.  We barely had enough food to get over being hungry.  We took our food as take-out and also had a good portion of our food missing.  I would NOT go here if you have other options."}
{"text":"Wow oh wow, how in the world is this place still around. Aside from checking out the gorgeous interior and the beautiful tanks full of goldfish, this place should be avoided completely. 

I seriously wish I checked Yelp before coming here to see how bad this place was. Granted, I didn't order any of the noodles (which this place is named after), I thought I would try some of the meat dishes.

Kung Pao chicken (something like $16) - wow a horrible dish. Chicken wasn't flavorful even with the sauce, there were barely any peanuts or any other vegetables in the dish. Quite bland (aren't there Asians cooking this stuff in the back??)

Beef with vegetables - This was the better of the two. Beef was tender and I got to eat veggies, but the sauce was quite bland too. 

White Rice - FOUR DOLLARS!!??!?!? Are you kidding me?? I know Vegas is overpriced, but come on!

Juicy Pork Dumplings - Quite bland, but it was juicy.

Stay away from this place!! I wish they would put some MSG in the food or something. Gosh"}
{"text":"This teview is based on a visit at 10:15 PM on 7/1/2009.  I went there expecting to see the noodle being pulled and made, since it is a noodle shop, but unfortunately the bar by the noodle maker was closed.  As a noodle lover and homemade noodle creator, it would have been awesome to see how they made it.  As the name of the place implies, Beijing Noodle No. 9.  You should only go for noodles here.  Handmade noodles goes best with beef stew (usually hong sao.)  But the broth here was different.  It was not spicy, not too salty, lightly sprinkled with cilantros and scallions.  The noodles were excellent and worth the taste experience.  As i mentioned before homemade noodles goes best with beef broth and the flavor and amount was perfect.  Everything else at this place, I skipped because of my own built in homemade noodle bias."}
{"text":"While the layout and design is fantastic, the food is quite bland, portions are very small and the service was terrible."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't read a review that mentions that the ceiling cut-outs are completely nauseating! We actually had to stare at the table to keep from getting sick! Also, the tanks of goldfish kind of put me off my meal... Usually a restaurant that has tanks actually stocks fish it serves in said tanks. As we entered, I immediately thought, \"Please don't tell me they serve goldfish here.\" The food was okay. It was fine. Not worth the price tag and there certainly wasn't anything about the ambiance that would bring me back. Save your time and money, oh, and your stomach."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch since nothing else seemed appealing. I had the beef soup with handstretched noodles while my boyfriend got the jia jia mien. Honestly, the food was just okay. Not worth the 15 bucks when I can get the same thing for half the price. The only reason I gave this place a 3 star rating is because of the decor of the restaurant. Gold fishes are everywhere here! I felt like i was in a fish tank **bloop bloop**.  Would I come here again? Nahh."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner here because it was quick and convenient.  The food is decent and it is possible to get in and out with few hassles."}

{"text":"It's exactly like the review of Yelp....2 stars...mini portion and expensive.....I understand expensive cause in the casino....but the portion was too too small......the taste is not authentic Chinese food.....service was ok....."}
{"text":"Come on yelpers if there is a better place to eat then you need to tell me about it. The decor of the place  was so cool and different. Unlike anything I saw on the strip. The wait was a little long, but it gave me time to shop in the meantime (30 minutes). Take cool pics with the gold fish.  

We ordered the Sweet and Sour Shrimp soup, Honey BBQ Pork, and Fzhou Fried Rice.  Everything was superb on taste. Nice flavors and seasoning.  The wait staff didn't hover but were always available.  Definitely coming back to try the hand tossed noodles next time.

A cool think to catch while you wait is the cook in the window making noodles by hand tossing and twisting the dough in the air.  I was very happy with the whole experience!"}
{"text":"The place has so much stuff going on! Aquariums, goldfish, crazy ceilings, etc. But when it comes to hand pulled noodles they're high in my charts.

I had the chicken and mushroom sauced hand pulled noodle and it was so flavorful and the noodles were chewy and cooked to perfection. I loved everything about it, reminded me of korean jjajangmyun but more of a american gravy taste twist to it.

My friends had the chicken soup noodle dish and I can't remember if that was the correct name but it was so good!!!!!!! If you're hung over that is the ultimate soup!!! Just be ready for a nap afterwards!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch. It was not busy but the hostess was not at her post. I had to wait around, wondering where she was. Finally she came to get me and seated me next to a very rowdy Chinese family. 

I received a glass of water and I placed my order. I ordered the chicken and seasonal vegetables. She brought me over a fork and set it down without a word. I tend to get a little irritated at that, because I'm a white person, I'm an ignorant who can't use chopsticks? 

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks. On top of that, I never actually got a plate. I just ate off the serving dish because no one bothered to give me one or check on me."}
{"text":"first time i tried it was for take out. Got the salt and pepper chicken. was very good. also got black bean spare ribs from the dim sum menu. also steam bbq pork bun. too sweet. 2nd time i ate in with the gf. service was slow on the dim sum. a small bowl of soup for 9.99 is outrageous. i mean i understand its Vegas but the portion was size for a toddler. Anyways price overall is a little cheaper then other chinese spots in vegas. Overall if you are at Caesars Palace and need some chinese food late at night  that includes some dim sum dishes, this place to go."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao are LEGIT but pricey at $13.99 for 6. And iced tea for $5.99?! Wtf?! Service sux with slow and unfriendly staff. Go only if you have resort credit and don't have a car to venture into Chinatown for soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"Let's just say this was not my favorite but it was ok.  The sauce was just ok, the noodles were ok but the brisket was more than half fat...we basically ate noodles with broth.   The spring rolls were mushy but Flavor was ok ...

Literally ok is th best word I can come up with ...but the service and food was quick... not sure I would be back but it was quick and open 24 hrs ...all good in vegas !!"}
{"text":"Right in the casino action you wouldn't think this place would be very good, but it IS!
Clean, creative and busy this restaurant is stepping right into authentic cultural cuisine. We had the eggplant with green beans ; best eggplant I ever ate! We accompanied that with a curry vermicelli noodle with shrimp. The curry was mild and not over powering.a glass of Tsing Tsao beer made this a meal to repeat!
Fantastic restaurant"}
{"text":"Great service and food is a lot more authentic Chinese compared to Noodle at Bellagio. Some homecook style dishes here as well. Eggplant with fish sauce is good, chicken Wantan noodle soup is great, the pork tenderloin with cilantro is good. The ?The best? The dim sum pau with eggyolk is unbelievable tasty! ???is spicy and tasty as well with meat is tender and not overcook :)

Not sure about all the other average review but the feedback should compare with other similar price range chinese noodle house in the casinos..."}
{"text":"Video at entrance shows chefs hand pulling noodles, but we went on a Saturday afternoon and didn't see anyone doing it live. So, not sure if they hand pull noodles at the restaurant, or they just purchase from a company.

Dishes are really expensive. Most noodle dishes were $17-$19. Portion was small. 

We had the Zha Jiang Mien with hand pulled noodles - not much meat and the sauce was very salty. Noodles were tasty, perfect texture. But, the portion size was small.

The Wok Fried Beef Noodles with flat, rice noodles (not hand pulled) was also small in portion. Just a few, large pieces of beef. Such large pieces are tough to eat - usually beef is sliced into bite-sized pieces. Beef was marinated so that it was butter soft, but almost spongy. Didn't taste like beef, and the texture was too soft. Also hard to share this dish - not enough meat to share. Dish was also really greasy, too much oil used. 

Soup Dumplings - divine. Served with vinegar and ginger. 

Service - eh. Was ignored most of the meal. Asked for soup spoons for the dumplings three times before someone actually brought them over. Water refills seemed like a bother."}
{"text":"I love this place.

After the worst dining experience on the other side of Caesars at Michel Richard, my buddy and I sat down at the noodle counter and waited for it to open.

I watched my noodles get made, cooked and prepared by the master noodle maker (i'm sure there is a Chinese word for this) and had the best bowl of Pork, Mushrooms and Noodles.

I think my wife is still mad at me for not bringing her along.  Next time..."}
{"text":"Worse chinese place ever!! Service sucks .. Sat down waited 30 mins just for someone to come over and place couple plates.. Then had to wait 20 more mins to hunt down someone to take our order.. Now i would understand if they were bzy but they are not!! Then ano 30 mins later our food came out and it was cold.."}
{"text":"If you are on the Strip and looking for a reasonably-priced sit-down restaurant, this is it.  The tanks of goldfish and all-white decor are kitschy in a good way.  Seating is white faux leather and is starting to show its age.  Service is adequate.

The noodles are hand-pulled here.  My favorite is the Beijing Zhajiang ($19) but the Sichuan lamb noodle is good too.  The mini Sichuan wontons (spicy) are great for two to share -- flavor-packed yet wonderfully light.  The fried onion pancakes are a solid choice if dining alone.

RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Nothing special here!  There are several large fish tanks full of gold fish as you walk in.  I thought their specialty was gold fish.  The food was okay and not worth the prices.  We ordered the walnut shrimp, pork spare ribs, shrimp fried rice, beef chow fun, and the seafood wonton.  The best dish by far was the pork spare ribs.  Despite all the bad reviews for service, we actually had good service.  The food is better than what I can get in Tucson for Chinese food.  I give this place 3 stars because my standards and expectations are higher for Vegas.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ever since I was a yay-little boy coming to yearly Vegas trips with my family I have watched the chef toss and craft-fully make symmetrical noodles in awe. This is where my father comes out of nowhere to tell me grand story of how authentic \"la mian\" was made back in the day when there was no machines or fancy devices. To my surprise, this was one of the stories that I was legit fascinated by because of how even these noodles looked being twirled in the chef's hands. 

Fast forward 20 years and I watched the Netflix documentary Ugly Delicious, which features this restaurant as one of the authentic joints catered towards the Chinese community. I finally come to Vegas to give this place a shot and I was pretty disappointed. Prices were of course hiked up but the flavors were pretty bland and not that authentic. Seemed to be catered to non-Chinese customers rather than being ultra-authentic like Ugly Delicious suggested. I got the la-mian noodles of course but with the Dan Dan flavor. This is typically an extremely bold dish with flavor but even this dish didn't seem to pack the punch that I desired. 

If you want good asian food, head to Spring Mountain. There are way better options out there such as Noodle Pot for beef stew noodles. Oh yeah I got that too and the flavors were not on point."}
{"text":"they advertise hand made noodles but they need to advertise it more. the place was a little dirty to be honest and caesars mgmt needs to devote more attention to this place. the decor is cool as hell but the menu and execution sucks. they have the tools to do a lot more with the place but may be relying on the decor to do all the work.

i also asked for 2 desserts, one after the other was not available, and both were not available. 

if you go to a buffet you can probably find most of the stuff and in better quality

JEANS: OK by far
ORDER: waitress"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! 

My rating is solely on the FOOD and not the service. I wish Yelp created a different feature so you can rate topics individually. 

As far as the food, it was very delicious. So many things to choose from. We ordered the vegetable noodle soup, chicken chow mein, Mongolian beef and the cucumber garlic appetizer. Everything was tasty. 

Now as far as the SERVICE, it sucked! couldn't get any worse. The female hostess have no interest in helping you and there is a big sign in the front that says \"allow the hostess to sit or check you in\". Something of that sort. However, there is no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Maybe it's a cultural thing............maybe not since I'm familiar with the culture and it's nothing like how we saw. We finally sat and was greeted by a nice gentleman. Sure he was nice, and took our order but after that, we never saw him again. Literally.......No one ever came to refill our drinks, ask us how our meal was, bring us napkins, straw, our bill? We had to track down everyone for things...

All the negative reviews of this place say the same thing. The level of service is awful. Caesars Palace needs to do something about it. 

Think about it.............."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from.  I think they must be high maintenance customers!  We ate there for the first time last week and ordered dim sum for appetizers and then two entrees.  We had the soup dumplings (perfect) and the BBQ pork buns (amazing).  We had pork fried rice and a chicken and vegetable dish (delicious).  The vegetables included a generous portion of fresh asparagus, zucchini and bok choy (I think).  It was all delicious.  The service was impeccable!  We never had to ask for a drink refill and the servers kept an eye on us in case we needed anything else.  The food was piping hot when it was served.   It was fun watching the chef in the front make the fresh dough for the dumplings.  Quite a process!   We would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"While I only tried a small selection of what they had I was amazed by the taste. One of my favorite dim sum standards is the bbq pork buns which I believe they did amazing well. The reason I went was roasted duck sounded realllly good with my drinks in the room. Took some roast duck to go and believe me even after I finished I was still sucking the bones. So amazingly good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely expensive, but I guess management somehow has to pay the rent inside Caesar's Palace. My relatives arrived from China in the United States for the first time and I decided to take them to Beijing Noodle #9 because they said they were craving Chinese food. 

Despite the high price tag attached to all the items on the menu, the food quality was not bad. I myself had the roast duck noodle soup ($18.99). There were four big prime pieces of duck in my soup, lots of flesh and little bone. I was very pleased with this and the soup broth was not very salty, thus drinkable. Only thing the noodle soup could have improved on was the choy sum. The chef staff could afford to put a few more pieces of choy sum into the soup, I know choy sum isn't that expensive. There were only three little pieces of greens that accompanied the duck and the noodles. The beef chow fun ($19.99) was very authentic and terrific too. The portion size was enough for 3-4 people to share. But paying $19.99 for a beef chow fun in Las Vegas definitely angers my wallet a little bit too! Even a pot of Jasmine tea costs $4.99. 

Service staff was friendly here. They speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin here. They came around and checked up on us once after all the food had arrived at our table. Waters were refilled once too. Not the best customer service here, but it satisfied our table needs. 

Being the Vegas fanatic I am, I don't know if I would come back again. The menu prices are kind of baffling. I might instead take an Uber and head to Chinatown for a cheaper meal!"}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodles are the BOMB.  HOLY CRAP, they have a guy who just stands there and pulls fresh noodles all damn day.  If he's going to all that effort, you have to eat those noodles.  

They were honestly delicious.  I ate at this place twice while in Vegas, that's how good it was.  I got the dan dan noodles the first time, my boyfriend got the wonton ramen, both were delicious.  we got the soup dumplings, too, which were not as good as the ones we can get in LA, but still good.  the next time, i got the spicy beef with the hand pulled noodles, and one of the best soup noodle dishes i've ever had.  

service was great.  yes, it was pricey, but reasonable since all food in vegas hotels is pricey."}
{"text":"Well from other reviews it seems you either love or hate this place.  my friends and I loved it.  the pepper crab was one of the most delicious things ever.  yes its expensive, but so is everything else in this neck of the woods, so suck it up.  make up for it in free drinks at the tables, that's what we always do!"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp chow mein (don't recommend, average) and the pork wonton soup w knife cut noodle (recommend- noodles really made the dish). Service was initially great then restaurant got busy and we didn't see waitress for a long time. But we loved the Beijing bellinis- HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed all the dishes I ordered, and enjoyed the restaurant architecture and design, ambiance, and whole feel.  The gold fishes in the tank are beautiful.  Just like any other Asian restaurant on the strip, expect to pay a lot more than what you normally would back home. When it's busy, service is a little slow.  Use the down time to take pictures of the unique design."}
{"text":"Stayed at Caesar's Palace for a conference and ate twice here. First meal was beef shank noodle - good.  Went back and ordered seafood tofu casserole in claypot - terrible, bland and tasteless.  With tea, rice and tips, ended up $41.00.  Crapshoot what you get."}
{"text":"The food is good however the price is ridiculous.  When the bill came I nearly fell out of my seat.  Will come back when I hit the jackpot.

Pork and mushroom sauce with noodle is good.  So was the wonton noodle soup.

Very unique setup."}
{"text":"If your tastebuds are accustomed to a more savory/rich type of dish, then Stay away from this restaurant, and save your money. That is why I'm simply giving this place - 3 shallow stars . This place lacks flavor, seasoning, and awesomeness. But if you're a healthy eater then by all means Dine Here. And indulge in salt free , tasteless dishes. 

Lol Let me just recommend a  restaurant called Ping Pong Pang @ GoldCoast Casino. - Best Chinese cuisine ! You have to try their coconut shrimps & walnut dish! Better than Panda Express. Anyways, just find out for yourself then...."}
{"text":"Really really Americanized Chinese food. The portions are really large though, you can definitely share with someone. I was really surprised at the quality and taste for a restaurant at Cesar's. I would think that there are so many Asians at Las Vegas now that they would go for a more authentic taste. 

The decor is also really trippy and confused me whenever I looked around. It was too detailed to the point of looking really tacky."}
{"text":"A little pricey even for Vegas but their noodles and dumplings are made fresh so that kind of made up for it a little. We ordered the xiao long bao and dan dan noodles. The xiao long bao were juicy and fresh. Flavor was right. The dan dan noodles were fresh as well but not enough meat in my opinion. Loaded with chili oil. Pretty average dishes.

Wait was pretty long for 2 people during mid afternoon. They couldn't estimate any time and there was no where to wait. I waited around the slot machines but had to keep checking because I wasn't sure if they'd take the effort to look around for me when a table opened up. Decor is beautiful. Lots of fish at the entrance. Service was pretty boring. Hardly came around and when we asked for something, she just gave it to us and walked away."}
{"text":"The restaurant asked me to queue for 30 mins. When I came in there are few empty tables. When I make the order, they told me that the kitchen is busy although I saw that most the tables already have their food and I have to wait for another 15 -30 mins for the food to come

The food is okay but definitely not worth my time to queue"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved anything we ordered. Authentic Chinese food that reminds me of grandma's cooking. The liang mien, beef noodle soup, dumplings, pork belly hot pot, and cold platter were all delicious."}
{"text":"We went during lunch/dinner there were not that many people in there... the waiter was very nice! We ordered Sichuan dan dan mein... it was AWESOME! with the had stretched noodles!"}
{"text":"Food was very authentic, service was great.  The ambience was also fantastic. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was reasonably tasty. Poor service. Server disappeared; later found out he went on break (through our entire meal!). We were left with bussers and anyone else we could 'flag' down.  Manager was not helpful, just apologized and told me he was on break. Duh. I wonder how Beijing Noodle No's 1 thru 8 are doing!?"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you walk between a series of tall aquariums filled with goldfish.  Kind of gimmicky, but still cool.  The design of the restaurant is modern.  The seating layout was not my favorite.  A long community bench seat that had me sitting pretty close to the next group.  The floor beneath and besides my table was covered in scattered rice.  Perhaps a child was eating here before me?  Perhaps they just hadn't swept all day?  I'll give them a pass on that one though.

I started with the hot and sour soup.  This was my favorite dish of the meal.  Mushroom, tofu, and shrimp in broth.  For my main course I had the beef with asparagus.  This was alright.  The beef was tender.  The asparagus was large, fresh, and crisp.  I had a side of pork pot stickers.  These were oily and bland.  Not my favorite.  I had some hot tea with the meal also.  Jasmine I believe.  I had tried the dragon berry cocktail.  It was a mojito-esque drink with a Sprite base and muddle mint leaves, lime, and blackberries.  I would recommend.

My waiter was very friendly and attentive.  I am not sure if I would eat here again with the variety of noodle shops in Vegas, but Beijing Noodle No. 9 was not so bad."}
{"text":"A lot of people on Yelp who reviewed have a problem with the service and for some reason, the food here.  I've been a fan of this place for awhile and absolutely love eating here when I'm craving salt & pepper chicken, shumai and house noodles.

I lived on Guam all my life, and I hoped to find more than a handful of places to eat really authentic Asian food. Most of them are Americanized to fit the pallets here, but I think this place keeps it as close as you can get to what I'd eat back home.  The dishes I mentioned earlier are definitely something to try when you go here.  They're all I order because it's that good.  I love the extreme saltiness, sour, and sweetness you get from their sauces and spices.  That's what it's all about.

As for the service, it's normal to me.  I'm used to them not smiling and kissing my ass because that's not how it's done in any restaurant I visited throughout Asia or back home.  If you want them to cater to you hand and foot, visit a five star restaurant.  Despite their \"attitudes\", they serve quickly, clear the table as you eat, and drink refills come quick, too.  

Give it a try and order salt & pepper chicken, their shumai, and their sauteed house noodles (beef and mushroom are good).  I hope that you like it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Food: It was okay; better than most Chinese food, but nothing to write home about! If you are starving for food, like we were, then this will suffice. 
Service: Horrible! Did not refill water glasses; male servers were not attentive in any manner whatsoever! 
Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you are drunk and don't know where you are walking! We weren't drunk, but did not check Yelp before going in! 
Plenty of other places within Caesars that you can get better food and better service."}
{"text":"Just an update... Mr. Jason Ming General Manager replied to my yelp review saying they take reviews seriously and he'd reach out offline... Complete BS. Never reached out. 
So sad. They practically have a monopoly being the only noodle place and they just dissapoint in every way. 

Even other guests at the hotel I met ragged on the place."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants in my life but I've never seen a place that made their own noddles...until now.  The sight of a smiling chef expertly massaging the dough and then twisting and braiding it into long, rich noodles was something that I had to try.  Not to mention the funky Clockwork Orange meets James Bond interior and Beijing Noodle #9 made an excellent first impression on me.  

Once my party was seated an investigation into the menu showed some tried and true favorites along with some more authentic style Chinese dishes that you wont find at your local Chinese joint.  But coming to this place and not getting the noodles would be a sin....Chairman Mao himself would roll in his grave.   So we went safe and got a plate of Chow Mein noodles with Chicken and supplemented it with Kung Pao Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Chicken and Yangzhou Fried Rice.  If the other three dishes were Mercedes Benz's, the Chow Mein noodles were a Rolls Royce.  They were incredible.  Al dente and full of flavor, you know immediately you didnt just put Panda Express in your mouth.   The Kung Pao shrimp had 8-10 huge shrimps in rich sauce with nice spice that wasn't overwhelming.  The salt & pepper chicken was phenomenal with a very light & subtle breading that captured the simpleness of the seasoning.  The fried rice was good but in reality one can't really reinvent the wheel and fried rice tends to fried rice.  A nice touch however is that the rice was blended with vermicelli that gave it a unique consistency.  

Overall, the food was excellent and a big step up from run of the mill chinese places.  The fresh, handmade noodles are otherworldly and might be worth the trip alone.  Service is inconsistent but friendly and prices are reasonable, especially given that its in a luxury property on the strip.  

I felt like Marco Polo discovering what a noodle was for the very first time...."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure who their demographic is, but I think they've targeted the character's from Nemo and The Little Mermaid. 

When you walk in, precariously positioned into forming an aisle, are several fish tanks of small goldfish. 
Lots of goldfish. As in thousands of goldfish and nothing else. 
No little underwater scuba diver figurine blowing bubbles. 
Or rocks to dart in and out of. Or plastic weeds.
Just thousands upon thousands of goldfish. 

Then there was the hostess...dressed in orange.
The walls and ceiling resembling an aquarium.
And the lighting, making it seem you were part of the whole goldfish spectacle.

While you're looking around, scouring your memory banks to recall if you've ever seen anything this weird without having first ingested a generous quantity of  LSD, a waiter dressed with orange fish buttons will appear.

He'll suggest ordering their hand-stretched noodles, but don't.
Eating these flavorless 'things' will only dredge up bad memories of when you were in college, eating ramen like it was your job.
Now you're curious. 
This whole thing is too weird..it has to be a setup...a camera crew about to come running out of the kitchen to inform you how you've just been punk'd.

But sadly, there's no producer...or crew. 
Just your fish-buttoned waiter, the orange hostess, and your date, who's incessantly jabbering about how cool this place is. 
What does she know? 
She ordered the rice cakes and green tea. 

If you do get suckered into this place by the Chinese guy in the window hand stretching the noodles, you're in for a good sized check and a disappointed palette. 
On your way out, stop and check-out the goldfish tank for any tits-up floaters. 
The orange hostess will look at you like your crazy.
Screw her. 
She's the one dressed in orange."}
{"text":"Thought this place was pretty good but I have had better.  My friend ordered the brisket noodle dish and felt that all the meat was fatty and didn't it any of if.  However, the broth and noodles were tasty.  I did enjoy the steamed shrimp dumplings...they were very good."}
{"text":"Super expensive for what it is. Mediocre Chinese food. But because it's in Caesars Palace, there is a markup. An incredible markup.  Go to Chinatown if you can.

It's basically the 2nd choice if the Buffet is too crowded. Waiting in a long line for the buffet is much better than wasting your time here."}
{"text":"We settled for this restaurant in caesar's palace because the parents were too tired to go elsewhere

I feel like their hand pulled noodles might lure customers in but these were pretty OVERcooked & served in BLAND beef soup.

I'm actually glad I went with the Singapore noodles instead, although in terms of flavor they weren't TOO much better

Overpriced underwhelming Chinese food

NOTE they offer takeout but if the kitchen is too busy they say it can take up to an hour ?! SKIPpppp"}
{"text":"The noodle is good, maybe one of the best on the strip.  however, all their servers have poker faces and terrible services. Definitely not worth the price we paid."}
{"text":"So watching them make the noodles is very cool. And makes you want to try it.   

So we were there at 9pm and it was not busy but for some reason we and other people waited for 20 min.  Probably was understaffed but I counted 5 servers serving on 7 tables. Probably could do more but hey I don't run it. 

Beef noodle soup was the highlight they were great. Wish the fresh made noodle Had tapioca in it to make chewier.  

The Dan Dan.   Sucked.  I mean take noodles had spicey sesame oil and there you go.   Oh wait forgot there was a tiny bit of meat.  

Other dishes we got were not memorable so 

Would go back for beef noodle assuming I won at the tables. Haahaa"}
{"text":"When ordering our entrees, they asked \"would you like rice with that?\". Both me and my husband answered yes. We were shocked when we received the bill and each tiny bowl of white rice was $7 - apparently, rice is charged a la carte. After ordering, receiving your food takes an unexpectedly long time. The service was great, though.

For $18, the portion size of the the General Tso's was insultingly small and looked/tasted like they just dumped hoisin sauce on it. However, The Mongolian Beef ($23.99) was delicious. Robust and flavorful with tender slices of beef and a portion size worthy of the price. 

Overall, a decent experience, but nothing to write home about. WAY more expensive than I would have liked. Could have eaten at the famous all you can eat Bachannal Buffet right next door for the very same cost, if only I'd had the patience to wait in line for an hour."}
{"text":"Service was so bad we had to beg them to take the check to pay.

If u want to learn how not to run your restaurant, take a seat here and order water. Itll take 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade noodles. Very authentic dishes at reasonable prices. You can get a discount with your player's card too! The servers are knowledgeable and prompt. What a fabulous-looking room. I didn't want to leave. I can't recommend this place enough. Order the knife-cut noodles, you won't be sorry! We had a wonderful experience here despite at first being ignored by the hostesses. The food more than made up for it!"}
{"text":"I thought Beijing Noodle was pretty good. If there wasn't so much to try in Vegas, I probably would have gone back a couple more times. 

I don't know how exactly to classify this because the food they were serving would be like a fraction of the price in Chinatown, Anywhere USA, but here in Vegas, it was ridiculously expensive.

Yes, the flavors are cleaner, the noodles are fresher, and overall relatively cheaper compared to other restaurants in Vegas, but it's still like double digits for a bowl of wonton noodle soup with shrimp. So I guess that's something to keep in mind.

If you factor in convenience, gorgeous decor ( I could stare at those goldfish tanks for hours...), and very clean, delicious chinese food, then this place will be just the ticket.

My recommendations - beef noodle soup ( delicious collagen broth and hand pulled noodles) and dao miu ( pea tips steamed and stir fried in Garlic)."}
{"text":"Beijing Noodle was literally right next to the elevators to my tower at Caesar's. Debated for a while eating there due to the bad Yelp reviews but ultimately ended up eating here three times in two days.

I can see two reasons for the 2 star rating: (1) hostesses are terrible and really slow to seat people despite the large amount of tables available; (2) restaurant is not super clean.

That being said, this place is pretty authentic. My boyfriend is Chinese and we live in San Francisco so I am a pretty good judge of Chinese food. Ordered a couple of the noodle dishes, mapo tofu, and the green onion pancake. All were really tasty! Waiters were all very polite and the food came out quickly.

Yes, this place is 'overpriced' but so is everywhere else in Vegas. In general a good spot and they are open for 24 hours."}
{"text":"Well, I highly agree with most of the reviews... overpriced, awful food, and terrible service!  The food was disappointing, so I didn't care if the portions were small.

On my first visit, I decided to take the food to the hotel room and asked for an extra condiment.  Surprisingly, they were reluctant to give it to me.  I even spoke with two people because the host got distracted.

On another occasion, they forgot to include the utensils, chopsticks, and soy sauce.  My friend had to go downstairs again to pick them up.

Unfortunately, the service dining in wasn't any better.  From the start, the restaurant was more than half empty, but there were a lot of people waiting to be seated.  We all didn't see a reason for it because the tables were cleared and cleaned.

After eating here several times, I expected an improvement after every visit - especially since they're located at Caesars Palace.  I really wanted to give this place a chance, but never again for me.  The decor is quite nice, though.

Now that the food court is open after the renovations, there are more options for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"2.5 stars is more like it.  The woman wanted asian cuisine and we were staying at Caesar's.  She ordered dim sum and soup.  The dim sum and soup was just okay at best.  Why my woman would want to eat asian cuisine even though she knows its not good is beyond me.  We've eaten here before with the same results."}
{"text":"The worst chinese restaurant ever. Also unnecessary expensive. The noodle is tastless and dumplings are too thick and feels like frozen before.  The service was ok."}
{"text":"Awful restaurant.  The server Helen tried to talk me out of ordering the daily special because I wasn't Chinese enough to appreciate it (bigotry from a food server, really?) and then one of our meals never came until we reminded her twice.  By the time it came everyone else was done eating.  The food was okay, nothing particularly good, and thus seriously overpriced.  I can't believe the management of Caesar's Palace let's a place like this set up shop on their premises."}
{"text":"So I was in the mood for Asian food and after countless research on yelp and Google, this place looked like it would deliver. Boy how wrong I was. The service was terrible. The server tried to get my friend to order two separate entrees when she just wanted a side of rice to go with her general tsos chicken. After we got our meals he disappeared and didn't return until about 15 minutes after we were done eating. My friend ordered the general tso chicken. It was bland and more breading than chicken. I ordered the chicken and mushroom noodles. The hand pulled noodles were slightly undercooked but still really good. The chicken was horrible and didn't even seem as if it was chicken. The texture was more of the organs than the meat. Needless to say it was very questionable. The experience all together was crappy but our server put the cherry on top when he took the bill and never returned with the change. Normally I tip 20% or above but he seemed ok with his 10%. I won't be going back there, I would have been more satisfied with panda express."}
{"text":"I am very surprised by the number of poor reviews for Beijing Noodle. This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant and there are no P.F. Changish dishes going on here so maybe that's part of the problem. I am only knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars because the service( even for a Chinese place) is challenging and in true fashion it's hard to get away from the MSG here. 
 Some general notes-observations that may help:
To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the \"Palace\" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable. 
If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.   
Beef with Hand Pull Noodle -sensational and complex beef flavor.Not all that spicy a advertised.

The XO sauce works well with the velvety noodles but the MSG is a bummer for me.

Asparagus and Scallop in XO sauce- well executed by not my favorite of the lot. 
The scallops were a tad sandy and that is always a no-no.

The pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best noodles I've ever had! I've come here a few times over the past year and a half whenever I'm in Vegas and it is simply delicious. I recommend the hand-pulled noodles with eggplant sauce (my favorite!)."}
{"text":"When you look on Yelp, this restaurant might seem more affordable and good, but save yourself the trouble and check out another restaurant! All the dishes cost way more than they're worth. My family ordered the shrimp fried rice, kung pao chicken and shrimp dumplings. Everything was presented poorly and did not look appetizing at all. Just like its visuals, the taste itself matched it. The shrimp fried rice was mediocre, but was the better dish out of the three. The kung pao chicken is NOT recommended. The meat was but into small baby bites and didn't taste authentic at all. The sauce was very watery and didn't hold much flavor and the dish itself was very plan. Just chicken and peanuts here and there. Out of all the kung pao dishes we've had at Chinese restaurants, this has got to be the worst we've ever ordered. The shrimp dumplings came very late -- after we finished both the shrimp fried rice and kung pao chicken. The dumplings looked very dry as if it was sitting out the whole time and it was very salty. Again, save yourself the trouble. If you're looking for a cheaper restaurant, there are more places on the strip!"}
{"text":"Gross. Overpriced and underwhelming. Noodles were worse than top Ramon. There way too many restaurants in las Vegas for you to choose this place."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner once and will never return. The food was overpriced for the quality but even more concerning was the service which set a new low. Threes tables sat beside each other. Me and my friend ordered second, and the table to our left last, but they were served first. When my friend was served, it took flagging down the waitress, asking where my meal was, for her to come back five minutes later, claiming there was a delay in the kitchen due to high volume, when over half the restaurant had cleared out since we entered. She also tried to claim that my dish, a Combo Chow Mein, took a long time to prepare, when the man sitting next to me ordered the EXACT same thing after, ate, and left before I even saw my food. The man on the table to my right experienced the same issue.

At no point were either of us issued an apology, only excuses. Avoid this place like a duck shaped scar on the earth swimming in a broth that tastes oddly like fish."}
{"text":"Super slow service but their noodle dishes are insanely good. Don't try anything else besides that. It's just another Chinese restaurant, other dishes are decent."}
{"text":"Not authentic Beijing cuisine, but also insects in vegetables, and even ice water is not good"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that restaurants have a Las Vegas surcharge, and this place is no exception.  Despite the slightly creepy fish tanks lining the entry to the restaurant, my partner and I decided to try out Beijing Noodle No. 9 if for no other reason that we didn't have to wait for a table.

We started off with the scallion pancake, which was very good but definitely not worth $9.  Next, we ate the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg, and the sizzling tofu with black bean sauce.  My partner just returned from Beijing a week earlier, and I almost fell out of my chair when he said he ate the same tomato, egg, and noodle dish every week for only $1.  At Beijing Noodle No. 9, it was $12.  The sizzling tofu was wonderful, and the sauce was so good, I ate it up with a spoon.  Yeah, I'm not ashamed to admit that.  You'd do it too if cost you $18.     

All in all, the food was pretty good, but like anything in Vegas, it was overpriced."}
{"text":"Beijing Noodle Number 9 is an adequate Chinese restaurant in Caesar's Palace. Decor is somewhat novel, large tanks of goldfish decorate one side of the restaurant. The interior is brightly lit and has hard surfaces making the place somewhat noisy.
Service was good. Food was nothing special, we sampled some dim sum appetizers and a variety of noodle dishes, fried rice and Chinese stir fried vegetables. All were OK. Hand made noodles didn't look or taste handmade. Portions were on the small side."}
{"text":"$30 for 2 wontons, shrimp and scallops and their hand pull noodles. Flavorless and not worth it at all. I also try their tan tan noodle and it has the most weirdest after taste. The whole bowl of noodle was cover in chili oil. Which I expect already since it's tan tan noodle but the meat was little to none, the noodle was suppose to be their hand pull noodle as well but I would rather they serve us the generic one for half the cost. Overall it's pricy not worth it! I could have spend less at McDonald's and actually gotten full."}
{"text":"We were there this past weekend.  When I first tried the Braised beef noodle, it was actually OK.  My wife and I decided to go back for lunch the next day.  I ordered the same noodle - was disappointed because they made such a big deal about my request for egg noodle (which is what I ordered the day before).  They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.  To top it off, they were not consistent with the flavor.  Should have gone to Noodles at Bellagio."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing experience during my stay in Vegas.  We walked through Caesars Palace on Saturday night and saw them making fresh dumplings and noodles.  The fresh noodles enticed us to make a reservation for Sunday lunch.  We spent the rest of the night looking forward it.  We arrived on Sunday for lunch and ordered dumplings and handmade noodles.  The server came back and said that they will not be making handmade noodles today.  This was majorly disappointing, the whole reason we went was for the handmade noodles.

The dumplings, although fresh, lacked flavor and were not as good as I would have expected.  The flavors were bland and we found ourselves relying on the dipping sauce and soy sauce.  If the dumplings had been good, the lack of fresh noodles could have been forgiven.   

It would have also been nice to know that they were not having handmade noodles on Sunday.  This would have allowed us to eat somewhere else.  There are many, better, options on the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.

I went here last week AT 9-10PM and spent $20 on a bowl of noodles that weren't even that great. Upon walking in, I look down at the floor and it's littered with dirt, spoons, forks and even PENS! Wtf?! 

The hostesses were either bimbos or just downright rude. We asked if we could be seated at the bar, and the hostess smiled and mumbled something. I asked her to clarify, and she said, \"Well, if you don't mind that it needs to be bused.\"

So you just proposed that a guest would want to eat with dirty dishes sitting in front of them?

After I ate their noodles, I got severe food poisoning. Less than three hours after eating here, I had the worst food poisoning I had ever gotten in the past five years. I'm talking sweating, almost fainting, seeing dots and a crippling pain in my stomach. This is what happened."}
{"text":"Holy yum!! Came here on the 21st of October about a 1/2 hour before doors for Elton John opened. I was worried we weren't going to get a table. We were seated immediately. Then I wasn't sure how long the food would take. We were served within 10 minutes. The food was fantastic, reasonably priced, and so fast! Service was exceptional as well. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the most important fact - all the noodles here are hand made, hand rolled. Nothing tastes better than freshly made noodles. We never bother getting a table. Sitting at the noodle \"bar\" transports you out of Las Vegas to another place. 

OK, let me be very clear. Soup dumplings. The best I have ever eaten.  These are perfectly super hot - you better know how to properly enjoy Xiao long bao or you will undoubtedly burn your mouth.  These are so, so hot and tasty! 10+. The crispy duck appetizer, while pricy, rates another 10. Crispy, so tasty. Get your hands dirty. (Do wash your hands after gambling and before eating please. The casino experience is so germy.) 

My wife was already full when I had to have a bowl of killer Dan Dan noodles. So spicy hot, I cannot properly them. Look them up on Wiki.  You better be prepared with a cold Chinese beer.

Do not listen to the negative Yelpers?  As a Chinese food devotee I rate this experience a 10 plus, borderline 11, but it is not cheap. C'mon, you are at Caesers Palace in Las Vegas! Live it up."}
{"text":"Food here is ok.  I have had better though. I will not be coming back especially with all the bomb places to eat from in vegas."}
{"text":"Well tasted good but I got food poisoning.  Positive it was there, only thing I ate and the timing was right.  Im a hotel guest, very disappointing!!  Hope I feel better soon!"}
{"text":"Yes, you got a cool goldfish tank display. 

Too bad your food isn't as interesting or fresh as those fishes.

Sub-par Chinese food. I know I could get better from my local holes in the wall. The wait and service was kinda redonk. There were so many open tables and yet...we had a 20 minute wait? Huh??? Turnover folks! My super impatient, Chinese parents muttering under their not so thinly veiled irritation said it all:  \"These people don't know what they're doing. It'll be faster if I went back there, made my own noodles and cooked it myself. If I were running this place....\" Of course everywhere else nearby had too long a wait too so we waited. And then we ate. And it was unexciting. Noodles were nothing to phone home about. Veggies were kinda fibrously (i.e. not fresh). Fried dumplings were doughy. The chicken rice was bone, skin and rice. I do appreciate a little chicken meat now and again.

Lesson of the day: take a picture with the giant overpopulated fishtank and call it a day."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken with mushroom hand pull noodles & braised sea bass. Both dishes are so salty and horrible. Won't ever come back. I didn't check out yelp review before eating, otherwise I wouldn't have gone there."}
{"text":"horrible! no taste very expensive and staff just don't care!! If you want to see the \"Gold Fish\" just google it or go near by but do not enter!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Very stimulating and intricate interior design, delicious noodles, friendly service.

Cons: Soup dumplings weren't really soupy, service was a bit slow, overpriced.

I haven't really tried any other menu items to give an accurate review, but  I hope to go back one of these days to give it another try."}
{"text":"Just had this for lunch.  The waitress was texting when we can in.  She threw her phone down with an attitude and worked us to our table.  We order two bowls of noodle, the beef stripe and mini wonton.  The food was tasteless and bland.  I had to add soy sauce, which I usually don't do.  No vegetable in either bowls.  
You get discount for being a total reward member.   When we paid, the waitress told us that the manager was not in so she can't overwrite for us to get the discount.  We asked when will he back, she doesn't know.  She didn't bother to wait.  What kind of service at a 5 stars hotel.
Overall it was a bad experience in food and service."}
{"text":"The noodles are freshly made and you can see the chef make it through the window. That made me want to eat here. And the pictures online made it seem really cool. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to my expectations. The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it. The noodle, however, was really good. The texture and freshness was great. 
I probably will not be going here again. Just doesn't seem worth it when you have so many choices in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our dinner here!

We intended to go to the buffet at Ceasar's but my buffet paranoia (not being able to stop eating) kicked in and we stopped at this noodle shop. We were seated immediately--next to Jesse James and new wife, and no, I didn't say \"HOW could you cheat on the beautiful and talented Sandra Bullock?!?!?\"--and the server was really great. He was patient as we asked about every type of tea, gave us time, checked in, and seemed genuinely interested in our having a good meal. 

We ordered the seasonal veggies for an appetizer--holy Jesus, I could eat those every day. Perfectly cooked (ie, crisp and tender) asparagus, Chinese broccoli, and baby bok choy in a DELISH sauce. Heavenly. 

My lychee martini was strong, yum, with two lychee so hubs could have one-- find that in any other city! 

Entree time--we asked what the dish is that people come back for and the server said the chow mein. Ok, serve it up! I was a little disappointed that it meant not picking my noodle, but I survived. I ordered the beef, hubs the combo. When they brought hubs the chicken and we said, \"No, the combo,\" there were no faces or general poopiness, they just got him a new dinner (which took an appropriate amount of time, so some thought went into it for sure. You want it to take a bit when you send something back!).

My beef was good, maybe a little chewy, but I'm not much of a beef eater so I don't know. Hubs said his was delish. The noodles were super yummy--no complaints there.  The sauce was great. Our waters were always refilled. The server was really attentive, but not over the top. And I thought it was Vanilla Ice sitting at the table next to us. I wonder how Jesse James would feel about that. 

Here's the part that makes me say I really, really like the service and food here. We asked for those dessert rice balls because I've never tried them. They didn't have any. The server offered ice cream balls. I didn't want that, so we said we were all set. The server then came over with 4 cookies on a plate and apologized for not having the dessert we wanted and made the cutest joke: Yes, I made those cookies for you just now!  

I'm a baker, so I know me some cookies. Those were some of the best (ok, wait, the friggin' best) almond cookies I have EVER had, complete with a honey glaze and a few whole almonds on top, with the tiniest, I mean tiniest, hint of salt. Perfecto. 

So, I'll be back. Not sure why the negative reviews; I think this is a hidden gem for every day food. 

PS--the interior is amazing!"}
{"text":"It was Saturday at 11:15. We had just been turned away from one of our favorite Vegas restaurants because the kitchen had just had a fire and they were closing the restaurant.  Disappointed, we checked Yelp and found Beijing 9. 

B9 is in Caesar's Palace.  So, I made a quick stop to get my Caesar's club card so I could get a discount. (Club members get a dollar or so off each entree).

We ordered the Marinated beef shank as a starter. Very interesting. It wasn't a jerky but it wasn't really moist either. You could taste the five spice and other interesting flavors. A nice start. 

Next, the Szechwan Fish. Delicious fresh perfectly cooked flaky fish in a wonderful spicy red broth. This dish was spicy hot. Wow. Great spice that just kept on going. With one complaint, I had to ask for rice as that is extra, I was in heaven.

Next, egg noodles with the eggplant and garlic sauce. The eggplant had such fantastic depth and flavor. The noodles fresh, cooked appropriately and providing fantastic flavor. 

At about $70 for two of us for lunch, it was expensive. But when the pub with the famous chef's name on it next door is serving $20 burgers, this place was certainly appropriate, if not less expensive, than it's neighbors.  (That said, I will pass on ordering two $3.50 ice teas and stick with water next time.)

Overall, fresh, cooked as it should be and very good flavors. Yes. I am a fan and hope to be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant anywhere ever. I love coming here.  However, it is pricy so be prepared... it is the strip.  But so worth it for the occasional splurge... knife cut noodles are my favorite.  I also like the dan dan mien.  Eggplant and green beans are awesome, as is the Szechwan fish. Lamb or pork pancakes are another winner, and they have soup dumplings! I'm hungry all over again... yum.  They did change the menu recently so the salt and pepper shrimp isn't as good as previously, but still worth a taste.  Also, no more crispy beef or Beijing pork -- two of my favorites.  Overall though, a must try! :)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my meal here. It is WAY overpriced, even by Vegas standards.

I had the Black Pepper chicken. It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor. 

Others in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.

We had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid. 

I would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.

If you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot."}
{"text":"Beijing Noodle No. 9 is all sizzle and no substance.  The atmosphere itself is amazing--starting with the shockingly white decor, attractive hostesses, huge goldfish tanks, and even the very walls of the restaurant (white panels with cut out shapes set in front of the actual walls).

And that's where the magic stops.  Things didn't start well when the hostess (as attractive as she may be) made me wait for a table even though the restaurant was barely a quarter full.  They may have been severely understaffed, but that excuse is probably giving BNN9 way too much credit.  On my way out of the restaurant, she pulled the same routine with another diner.  Unsurprisingly, the poor service (which was neither fast nor friendly) continued inside the restaurant--sending the clear message that BNN9 neither cared about nor desired your patronage.

The Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns) was okay, with the nice soft doughy exterior as expected, but the barbecue pork filling seemed to be a little short on flavoring (at least for a what should be a high quality bun).  The Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup was enjoyable, with the seaweed and dried baby shrimp providing unique taste accents.  Finally, while I'm a fan of auspiciousness, $7.09 for a bottle of Tsing Tao borders on insanity.

All in all, you'll get better food and substantially better service (though without the cool decor) at Noodles in Bellagio."}
{"text":"Sure the place is expensive for Chinese food, but what a good experience we enjoyed.  The hand-stretched noodles were not only fun to watch when they were made but tasted great too.  All of the dishes were on the smaller and somewhat expensive side, but all were freshly made, quickly delivered, and so good we were literally finishing the sauce by swiping our fingers across the plate.  OK, that's an exaggeration... we're much more polite than that... but it was tempting!  The menu is very large and here is enough to make any one, even the pickiest eater, satisfied.  We wish we could have sampled more of the dishes offered!  Service, BTW, was fantastic.  Why not five stars, one might ask -- the price, that's all.  But considering that it is Las Vegas and inside a major hotel that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Liked it, didn't love it. Room is cool, with giant fish tanks and contemporary decor. Service was efficient, not friendly. Food was tasty but nothing special. And it was expensive. I ordered tea, sparkling water, Shu Mai and Kung Po chicken. 50 bucks with tip."}
{"text":"If you've ever reasonably good dim sum, don't bother going here. It is nothing special and really overpriced for what you get.  Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm Chinese, and I'm carbophobic. No, I don't really like rice or noodle, so why do I come here when I come to Vegas? I love the Lan Zhou hand pulled noodle, specifically the broth, beef, and veggie in the noodle soup. I love the fact that they always accomodate my request for less noodle but more veggie with extra cilantro and green onions. The broth is so yummy, light yet flavorful. 

I also like their black pepper filet migon cubes (very tender!), yangzhou style fried rice with shrimp and beef (suprisingly not greasy at all), and dim sum dishes.  

I've come here with non-Asian friends (white, Indian, and Jewish), and none of them has ever complained about the quality or service or flavor of the food here. 

I agree it is quite pricey, but again you are in Vegas! Also I'm sure those stunning-looking fish cost a fortune."}
{"text":"I come from China, I ordered Moo shu pork, duck noodle. I must say, this is totally what I eat in China. Very traditional and authentic flavor, which remind me of my family cuisine style. Best Chinese food I eat in U.S. Ever"}
{"text":"A lot to offer and very delicious.  

Order the noodle soup or pork fried rice.  

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ah the rare case of me randomly going to a restaurant with someone and checking Yelp only afterwards to discover that it's 2 stars!
The service was a little weird. First of all, the 2 of us had no idea what the host was saying at all. Later, my lunch companion got his soup at least 10 min before I got mine. He seemed to like his. I got the duck meat soup with rice noodles. I don't think the noodles were fully cooked. The broth was good, the duck meat that I fished out was good. There was questionable green stuff floating in my soup which was really salty and might have been seaweed or something.
Obviously, the place wasn't cheap (Caesar's Palace!). Walk out of the hotel and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Why oh why didn't I check the yelp reviews first?  Oh that's right, because I didn't dare risk using anything wireless during hacker conferences.  I hope you don't either.

But I digress.  Definitely watch the flashy handmade noodle show, both stretched and sliced off of a big brick of dough.  They looked appealing but tasted super bland, no matter what sauce or soup they put it in (we tried the beijing pork and black bean sauce specialty and the wonton noodle soup.)  I also got the taro boba (tapioca drink) and it had huge chunks of ice and was more vanilla tasting than taro.

I'm not hating on this place because it's \"Americanized,\" I couldn't care less if it's not what people in Beijing eat.  All I care about is it TASTING GOOD.  Bleh."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more so that is why I can only give Beijing Noodle No. 9 two stars.... part of me wants to give it three, but I know better and I need to rate this as I would anywhere else.  

The sleek white modern bright decor is fabulous... looks great, but after sitting there it was too bright.  Service was awesome.  Food was at best MEH (hence the two).  The one redeeming item was the corn and chicken soup (I think that is what it was).  

Also... when you are not busy, please do not seat the screaming kid next to two of the only diners... they did this and it was incredibly frustrating.  I was with my boss so it was not as bad as it could have been had I been on a romantic date with my husband."}
{"text":"The food here is actually good.  I'm not going to defend the service standard here. It's bad. Really bad.  Starting at the hosts all the way to the servers. But the food is good enough to make up some of the bad vibes.  Most any of the noodle dishes are good. The wait is long so if you can't deal with it go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bland and don't like how everything comes with no sauces! No sushi either would been happier to loose my money on one spin at the roulette table.."}
{"text":"LOVE the decor.  Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by huge tanks of goldfishes and the amazing thing is the water is really clean. If you ever had any kind of aquarium, you know its hard to keep the water clean and theirs is squeeky clean. The inside is all white and the ceiling is spectacular.  The kitchen is open and you can see the chefs prepare the dishes.  The decoration by the kitchen is very colorful, containers filled with many different spices. The burst of color by the kitchen is the  the only color you will find in this restaurant, except for the goldfishes. The servers are courteous and attentive.  The menu seemed pricey, dumplings being around $10 for 4 pieces.  To get our money's worth we ordered main entrees (15-25 depending on serving size), wanting to try the famous hand pulled noodles that are made fresh (you can watch someone make the noodles near the entrance of the restaurant). We ordered the Chef's handmade noodle with sliced pork and mushrooms, sauteed diced beef and fried rice.  We liked the noodles so much that we ordered a second one.  I thought the food was good but the noodle was the best of the bunch.  We loved the ambiance, the experience and the noodles.  For the price of the food and because of the smaller portions, i don't think we will come back.  I think it is a must try at least once and if I am hankering for fresh hand-made pulled noodles, and I have extra money in my pocket, this wil be the place to go."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical to go to Beijing No. 9 during my stay at Caesar's Palace because of some of the questionable reviews here on yelp, but after having lunch there, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the food was absolutely delicious and the service was exceptional. Everything was well seasoned and the portion sizes were great. The lunch menu options were a really great value, spending less than $40 for two people. My friend is a vegetarian and they had great options for her. I'll definitely eat  there again."}
{"text":"Totally indifferent food. Way too sweet and mostly little flavor. Poured wine way to much to pas check"}
{"text":"Service was rushed when it came to ordering. Server couldn't give us any recommendation when we asked. He pretty much just read the menu back to us. When the food came out, the server called out the dish differently than what it was on the menu. So of course we looked confused. We also ordered spicy salted shrimp and got Kong Pao shrimp. By that time, we just wanted to finish our meal and get out. The food was salty and not as satisfying as expected. Our waters were not filled until after we \"asked\" for our checks and did I mention the food were overly salty? so yes our water were gone quick. And we waited for a good 10 minutes before signaling someone down for the check. We went there purposely to get the hand pulled noodles and expected a show but instead it was pre pulled; Which we understand how much of a hassle it would be to pull noodle per order. Other than that the gold fish were beautiful! I hope they read their reviews and change things up a little bit."}
{"text":"Pro-Tip: If you are staying at Caesars Palace, do not be lazy and order from room service from here. Just get up and get take out! It is not worth 3X the price! 
We had just gotten back to our hotel from our day trip to the Grand Canyon and driving all day when we decided to look through the Caesars room service. There was a tab for late night bites which included menu from Beijing Noodle No. 9. We started looking at the entrees and the price and decided to look at the menus posted on Yelp to compare prices. Oh myyyyy when we saw that they were 1/3 of how much we were going to spend on room service, I decided putting on my pants and walking five minutes with no makeup on and tired eyes was worth it.
The restaurant is famous for its massive gold fish tanks that you walk through into the restaurant. 
Now the food...this was probably my least favorite meal of our trip to Vegas but it wasn't bad. The food was good though, the tso's and Thai tea tasted pretty good and I would give them a 4 stars otherwise. The steamed dim sum is the only item I wouldn't recommend.
We ordered Steamed BBQ pork buns($14),two Thai teas($7 each), and two orders of General Tso's($17 each) and I thought the rice was free but actually they were $4 per cup.... like i know Vegas is expensive and all but $70 for what we can get at home for $25 is crazy! 
This was us NOT getting the room service prices either...I can't even imagine... Good food when you're tired and don't care about price."}

I will come back for the noodles"}

Super cool goldfish tanks as a centerpiece to the entry.  Wall and ceiling decorations made you feel like YOU were in a fishbowl.

The decor is very chic. There's an aisle way of fish tanks for you to walk through in your way into the restaurant, and the back half of the place showcases 300 different types of teas.
The pan fried pork dumpling is juicy, but the vinegar sauce that came with it was too vinegarry for me.
The Cantonese Roast Duck with skin on and plum sauce was fabulous! My only complaint is the small portion.
Very efficient service and no delays."}
{"text":"Beijing Noodle No. 9

*sigh*

Where should I start? Well I'll start with the one thing that wasn't bad with this place, the interior design. Pretty unique and different than your average noodle house. It's Vegas though, they have to impress. I'll say that it was the only thing that had me impressed.

Now with that out of the way, let's get on with the 1 Star reasons. First and foremost, the service was horrible. Our waiter took a ridiculously long time to actually get to our table and provide any kind of service. He took forever to come and take our order, bring out water, provide a fork for my girlfriend who can't use chopsticks, bring out our food, refill our drinks and bring out the check! To top that off, he had such an amazing attitude. Not! He was pretty rude, not going to lie. The food took awhile for it to make it on our table. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and we only ordered noodles and dumplings. Really?

On to the food now. Absolutely overpriced for the quality and quantity. Ordered the Chef's Handmade Noodles with Sliced Pork and Mushrooms. Barely any presence of sauce, pork or mushrooms on this tasteless noodle concoction. Plus, there weren't many noodles to begin with for paying $15.09. Yeah $15.09, because all there items are priced with .09 cents at the end. Hence the restaurant name. Laaaame. Oh, did I mention that paying $15.09 was a preposterous amount to spend on a tiny bowl of noodles that didn't taste good? I know it's located in Caesar's Palace in good ol' Las Vegas but come on! My goodness. I honestly could have enjoyed a \"Cup 'o' Noodles\" more. The pan fried beef dumplings that we ordered were ok. I've had better tasting dumplings for a cheaper price. Good grief.

Well I am completely 110% sure that I will not be visiting this restaurant ever again the next time I'm in Vegas. Such a shame that there were so many other choices out there that we ended up choosing this one. Wish I had my laptop with me so I could have checked the reviews on this place."}

{"text":"Service is EXTREMELY terrible. I got food poisoning from the cod they brought me. And the fish tanks did not look clean at all, filthy. The tofu didn't even taste like tofu. It tasted like the rotten cheese you find under your bed. I'm sad your not able to do 1/10 of a star review."}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas not in Chinatown.  Being a Chinatown boy-- this place is a little hard for me to accept.  The food was expensive as hell.  Wonton noodle soup cost $18.. Dumplings $15... the list goes on!  I kept doing the math in my head... I could've bought 6 wonton noodle soups back home for the price of this one lousy bowl of noodles... 75 dumplings for this one plate of dumplings, etc etc.    Ok ok ok-- the noodles weren't lousy, in fact it was decent considering there weren't many authentic Chinese options in the area.  I actually even liked the decor!  They lined the entrance with huge goldfish tanks, all white interior and even a petite Chinese girl in a short skirt  at the front (I swear she's decor because she didn't speak much English).  

I'll give this place 3 stars only because it did satisfy my craving but I can't say I'm ever coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the Chef's Handmade Noodle with Sliced Pork and Mushroom.  My gf had noodles with egg and tomato.  Mine was pretty decent, and so was my gf's, but neither one was anything special.  The egg and tomato is something I make myself..  albeit with rice, but still, it ain't no thang, and they charge like 12 or 13 bucks for it.

The decor was a little off putting, I think.  I mean, it was \"neat\"..  but, just too busy..  or something.  Like snazzy contemporary, but no soul.  I dunno, I can't put my finger on it.

Service was aight.  Took forever to get our bill.

Overall, it's one of those places that are eh, not bad..  but nothing to get that enthused about."}
{"text":"Food was worse than cheap Chinese takeout... And the price is around 15-30 a dish.   I felt cheated after eating tasteless, salty food and dropping 100 that should have costed us 20 tops with better food.  Service... We had to ask like 5 times before they came to take order.  Nobody came to ask if we needed water until our first order came like 10 mins before everybody else's order and appetizer came with rest of other others..."}
{"text":"Yesssss! 

This place is amazing! Our server Robert was great very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. 

I was super interested in trying the marinated jellyfish so Robert gave us a complementary little portion for the table to try. IT WAS DELICIOUS! (texture like seaweed salad almost) We also got some steamed buns, lamb rolls, shrimp and pork dumplings and the BBQ duck. Everything was very good. The duck (Robert did let us know) was very boney, it was a lot of work. 

Overall I had an amazing time and the restaurant itself, I felt like I was outer space or something it was so crazy!"}
{"text":"The white rice is hard, and if the white rice isn't good what does that say about the entrées.

Honestly just save your money and don't do it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here when we're at Vegas a few months back and I got to say it was delish! Great service and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Ok.  I don't think this place is 5 star, but I also think the 2 star and 1 star reviews are harsh.  Is it overpriced chinese food.  Absolutely, but you've also got to expect that from the STRIP.  Also,  you can tell the experience of the chefs because the food is more delicate than your typical hole in the wall chinese that they're being compared to.  

That being said,  we arrived on 930pm when they close at 1030pm.  Important to get there earlier as they stop taking people around this time.  We made it just in time.  I saw the hostess turn people away at 10pm.  Anyway,  we had the shanghai soup dumplings,  sautéed pea tips, dan dan mian, chicken broth with hand pulled noodles, chinese pancake with beef, jellyfish salad, hot sour soup and pot stickers.  

Warning, the dan dan noodles are super spicy and salty, so just know this before you order.  None of the food was bad.  It was tasty, but not the best chinese I've ever had. But will satisfy the chinese craving.  The sauteed veggies were well done and not overcooked.  

Hand pulled noodles were chewy and delish.  The soup dumplings were very good, so we had to add another order.  All in all,  if I wanted noodles or chinese and didn't want to leave the hotel,  I would eat here.  The service was fine.  Typically I have fairly low standards for service at asian establishments.  You know you're doing for food,  not the service.  Have that expectation in mind and you won't leave angry at any asian establishment.  Just a tip."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Noisy but with an energetic and happy vibe.   Great food.  Flavor was deep and complex.    Spicy chicken cubes - wow!  The name written in English does not do the dish justice!  Hot with red hot peppers but the depth of spice and levels of flavor came also from cumin and other flavors.  Possibly turmeric.   Hand tossed noodles perfectly perfect.  Sriracha oil wontons  amazing - hot but just the right hot.  Bejing noodles in sauce were sweet almost but savory with a hint of a mushroom sauce.  I can't say enough good.  Make a reservation!!  There were 4 of us and one of us had 3 beers.   We had 2 Thai teas and 1 jasmine tea.  180 was total.  Value was a perfect 10+!!!"}
{"text":"Located inside Caesar Palace. I like the ambiance with white steel carved white decor and huge tank of gold fish. I am surprised to find the meal pretty appetizing despite the bad reviews. I can understand the price is pretty high and the service is not the best but I liked what we ordered. We had 
- Beijing pancake that consists of honey BBQ pork pancake;
Clay pot beef tendon and 
Chicken mushroom with hand pulled noodle which was tasty. They charged $5 each for hot tea and also $4 for a bowl of rice.. They should have that free accompanied the meal. I may be back."}
{"text":"Definitely no service.  Very American Chinese food and super salty.  Coming here for whatever meal is ok.  But expect a good sit down meal, definitely so not recommend."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with those who have said that Beijing is great, but overpriced Chinese food. I really like that the food tastes fresh and is not loaded with oil or sauce. I did think it was a bit overpriced, but that seems to be the norm for Vegas. The decor is beautiful and it's really fun to eat in such a unique environment. 

My only complaint would be that the service was not at all impressive. We had to wait to be seated when there were only 2 other customers and none of our servers (yes, there were multiple), nor the hostess went out of their way to be friendly. 

But the food was yummy and I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Before ordering, I looked at all the reviews and I was doubtful. My friends and I decided \"what the hell, it can't be that bad\". I'm glad we went against the grain here... 

Everything we ordered was great! Presentation might have not been the greatest but the food definitely had flavor. Fried rice, shrimp broccoli, spicy fried chicken, duck plate, noodles. 

What made everything better was the fact that we could use our Caesar's comps. 

Our server was also nice."}
{"text":"I spent a week at Caesars Palace attending training and a convention so i had plenty of opportunities to dine at many different restaurants within the property. Beijing Noodle No. 9 was good, I dined there twice. There is a lot of variety on the menu, some of the items i had to ask about. While the food was good, service was very inconsistent. The restaurant is stunning to look at. It's very relaxing and beautiful."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!

I came here with my parents (Jan 2011) as I was craving some Asian food, and this place sounded like they had some great noodles. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The price was high the service was below average, the wait was long, and the food was just okay.

I was hoping for some good Chinese Green Tea as is complimentary at most Chinese Restaurants, however they charged by the person, so I skipped that.

What we ordered: 

Singapore Style Rice Noodles ($16.99): The menu had no description, so my family assumed it would be vegetarian. When these noodles came out, they had pork and shrimp. We don't eat pork, so we told our server that we couldn't eat the noodles. He started blaming us for ordering the food, and disappointment sank in. We asked if there was anything that could be done, and he said that he would ask them to make it with just shrimp. We waited for at least 10-15 minutes nibbling on the 'Crispy Chicken' and getting more frustrated as others were being attended to nicely. When the food finally arrived, there was no meat and no flavor. A complete waste of money.

Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon 
Noodle Soup ($16.99): The best dish we ordered. Tasted like a beef stew with noodles. Not amazing, but not bad. The beef was nicely cooked and the noodles were pretty good too.

Har Gow, Shrimp Dumplings (4) ($10.99): The dumpling wrapper was too thick in my opinion and it broke easily, holding a small piece of shrimp. Nothing special.

Crispy Chicken in Szechuan Garlic Sauce ($19.99): A small plate of 'crispy chicken' (dry chicken, very thin pieces), with 'garlic sauce' on the side. This was pretty much like Chicken Katsu, and I was not impressed with the Szechuan garlic sauce. Not worth it at all.

At the end, I was hoping to order a boba drink to go, but our server came by with our check before asking if we wanted any desserts or anything else, so I told my parents not to mention it."}
{"text":"An utter disappointment. 

Positives:
1) Server was prompt and good at her job.
2) We were sat almost immediately, surprising for a Friday night at 6pm.
3) My shredded pork entree had a nice spice to it.

Negatives:
1) Sat us at the bar right in front of the restaurant, area hadn't been properly cleaned, water glass still remaining and bar top needed wiped. Server cleaned this with a dry paper towel - should have left then.
2) Wife ordered beef n broccoli. Both meals came out quickly, however she found various uncooked beef gelatin in hers, as well as parts still being cold.
3) We both ordered brown instead of white rice - not knowing it would be an additional $10 each for roughly a cup of rice until we received our bill.
4) Most importantly, including our area, the bar/kitchen was in need of cleaning. The ceiling over where they make the pasta (including ceiling lights and camera) were filthy, with large visible dust accumulation. Also, the divider between bar and kitchen visibly hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in quite some time.

We debated between this and Searsucker, and boy, lots of regret on our part - sorry Caesar's, do better."}
{"text":"Delicious 24 hour spot. I recommend the bbq pork steamed bun. The decor is very fun. A must try when you're hungry after hours!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food in Las Vegas? Hell yeah!

Rule of thumb, a Chinese restaurant isn't authentic if the service is great, and even the service here is pretty authentically bad! Still above average for a Chinese restaurant though! Also, I was also pretty excited about my visit to Bejing Noodle No. 9 because your typical authentic Chinese restaurant resembles a hole in the wall, but this place is really REALLY nice inside! Of course its the strip on Las Vegas, everything is nice inside!

I couldn't believe that my girlfriend, a Chinese native, when on vacation from our San Francisco suburb where most of the good food is Asian to come to Las Vegas to eat MORE CHINESE FOOD. The prices aren't great but then again, that's a recurring theme if eating on the Las Vegas strip. These prices would never be acceptable if you found this restaurant outside of Las Vegas, but it works here on the strip. 

As far as the food goes, it's pretty fucking good! Any place that serves hand pressed noodles, barring any major setbacks is automatically four stars in my book. To take this even further they even have a prep chef you can see from outside the restaurant through a window hand pressing the noodles like some sort of culinary show.

My girlfriend ordered beef noodle soup and Xiao Long Bao and it was pretty bomb, I really didn't expect to find such good Chinese food in Las Vegas. I splurged and went for the $30 duck meat fried rice, which was the best fried rice I've ever had. And for $30 it better damn well be. I also ordered the Shu Mai which was actually pretty average by San Francisco standards, but still hit the spot. Also, this place gets bonus points for using real tea leaves in their tea. We ordered the Pu'er tea and drank all of it!

If your comfort food is xiao long bao, xiao mai and beef noodle soup and you're in Vegas you should check this place out. If the extent of your Chinese food experience is Panda Express and kung pao chicken you should also check this place out so you can get a glimpse of authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews.  I've eaten here at least 6 times and have not had a bad experience.  I always sit at the bar area where they make the hand pulled noodles.  Usually never a wait and food always comes out quick.  Maybe it's different in the regular dining area?

Here is a tip - they make hand pulled noodles right there.  The name of the restaurant is Bejing Noodle.  Order something with fresh noodles.  Why would you order anything else?

Good spot for a quick bite.  You can get a noodle dish or noodle soup for under $20.  Nice for lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere of this place is awesome and that's what initially attracted me to in while staying in Caesar's. Cool fish tank, nice decor. Everyone is dressed in all white and the entire restaurant is decorated in white. I tried a beef and noodle dish which was just okay, lacking any real flavor. I was really hoping for more and since it's Vegas it was pricey. I think my bill was somewhere about $35 for my meal and a beer."}
{"text":"The food failed to live up to the promise of hand-made noodles.

The two noodle dishes I tried here were very light on the meat and vegetables, the flavors completely uninspired, and despite being hand-made, the noodles tasted completely ordinary.  It could have been $3 delivery Chinese food.

Watch them make the noodles through the window (which is pretty amazing), but don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant for some great food. My favorite is the Dan Dan Noodles! I also love the lamb cumin dish, it was very good. The place is great little place for lunch or a simple dinner."}
{"text":"For the price premium I paid. I was expecting a above average quality. However, the food tasted average and the portion is significantly downsized. The average price of noodles and some other dishes are twice the price and half the portion compared to your typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Cloud 9.  

When you are inside, you literally feel like you're in the sky.  The interior decor is gorgeous!  I love the white metal artsy walls.  It is definitely very unique!  The only thing I don't like is the gold fishes.  When I first saw this place, the gold fishes freaked me out because there were too many.  I honestly would never had came in here if it wasn't for my fiance.  I'm sure glad that we made reservations here because the interior decor alone was all worth just being in there.  So, 1 star goes to the interior

So, we came here for a family dinner on Christmas day.  There were 18 of us.  They split the group into two.  We had no trouble with getting seated.  They have plenty of tables to accommodate to anyone.

The second star goes to some of the food that I ate.  

The food was not as impressive and was a little bland.  I also expected the food to be better since it is in the Caesar's Hotel.  My family ordered 1 small and 1 large Pork Noodle Bowls, 2 plates of Duck, 1 Braised Beef, 3 plates of dumplings, Fried Rice, Chinese Broccoli, and some other cold dishes.  The total all came out to be over $250.   All the dishes range from $15-30 dollars.  Again, nothing really wowed me, especially considering the price of each dish.  I was super excited to try the Pork Noodles Bowl because I heard that they Handmade their noodles, but I was disappointed.  The noodles were good, but the flavor was bland.  However, the only thing I really liked out of all the dishes was the Pork Noodle Bowl (small $15, Large $25), which says a lot.  The dumplings were okay too, not the best that I have ever tried.  I was especially sad when I ate the duck.  Duck is my favorite meat and it just tasted too clean.  Normally, chinese duck is full of yummilicious oily greasy flavor, but not this one.   

The portion for each dish is small, so we had to order multiples of each dish to feed a family of 9.

The service was decent.  Our waiter was really nice, but put down the Small for our dishes even though we explicitly told him that we were eating family style.  Due to this mishap, our family had to order more and the large dishes of all the small dishes that we got, which came out to more $$.  

Overall, sadly to say.. I would not come here again for chinese food, especially when considering the price, portion, and flavor.  Not the best that I have tried."}
{"text":"Now open 24 hours next to the buffet. They do pull asian noodles with meats as there entree. The service is relatively decent. The noodle taste of course isn't quite to par with other places that I've been too but if your looking for a midnight craving then it will do."}
{"text":"I just read some reviews that completely match my experience of Beijing Noodle # 9--great service, great decore, but very average food, and insanely inflated prices. This may be why we had no wait for a table, at all. The Beijing style hand pulled noodle with beef was fine but really it did not possess much depth of flavor. I loved the Spicy fish the waiter recommended, and I also liked Buddha beer, which I hadn't tried before, but neither was different from what I'd find elsewhere for half the price.  So, if you're here and you really want this food and you can't just drive over to Spring Mountain, i guess go here, but be warned."}
{"text":"Really good food not your typical run of the mill garbage Chinese fast food. This is great authentic flavors and something that I typically can't find especially in touristy locations. Usually have to be in china town in San Francisco or NY to get these flavors. The restaurant is very nice and has really cool fish tanks towards the front. Tons of different gold fish a cool visual 

Got the spring rolls and the shrimp chow main. Good stuff. I also ordered a bowl of the seafood hot and sour soup which we split."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant lured the customers for their fish tank. I would not recommend this place even if you are hungry.I ordered seafood noodle soup, it was lukewarm, 3 shrimps in a bowl and  tasteless. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite.  Caesars is nice, and I thought they held everything to a high standard, but Beijing Noodle 9 definitely disappointed.  A bowl of beef noodle stew will run you sixteen dollars.  I ended up paying a grip for a simple noodle stew, some scallion pancakes, and some braised beef.  The broth was definitely weak in flavor, and the noodles were only acceptable.  Definitely come here only if you have some comp points to spare.  Hate to sound like a degenerate gambler but the only advantage is that its quick so you can get back to the tables ASAP.  Besides that, it is incredibly overpriced, and falls way short in quality.  Don't come here expecting anything close to traditional taiwanese noodle foods!"}
{"text":"One of our orders were pineaple fried rice with ham and shrimp and it was good.  The jellyfish we ordered isnt as good as Diamond Chinas or KJ Kitchen (if you've been there) so dont expect too much.  Its not fine dining so I wasnt sure why their portions were small and extremely over priced. Would I go back if I was on property? No..... I would rather drive to China Town."}
{"text":"If I didn't fast all day to go to Bacchanal buffet as soon as I arrive in LV, and found out the waiting is for 5 hours, I would hate myself even accidentally dining in here. 

Even this place, I had to be in line for more than 30 minutes to sit at the bar. I ordered a shrimp chow mein and salt and pepper chicken because I didn't want to read the thick booklet menu. I chose panda express style items and expected the taste as panda's as well. I was starving enough to appreciate if the food was editable.

While i was waiting for my food, i was watching the noodle soup open kitchen. An old man was non stop making hot noodle soup. The way he cuts the noodle with his long finger nails, the way he dips his thumb in the soup, the way he touches order paper, wet towel, and food back and forth, I was loosing my appetite already.

I finally got my food, the cold bread crumb sized fried chicken pieces tossed in sodium spice. Seriously, garnished green onion pieces were bigger than the chicken pieces. Also the chow mein was served cold, soaked in oil. 

It has been a great while, having this nasty chinese food since I was in college. 
And later that night, I had a stomache, and I threw up. Oh wow, thinking about this place makes me feel like throwing up again..."}
{"text":"Lets be real. Most of us go to this restaurant only because Bacchanal is full. But the wait time at this noodle place isnt too much better--we waited for half an hour outside and another half an hour for our order, while the restaurant was half full the whole time. There were waiters and waitresses just idling around. And they didnt let us order when we were waiting outside even though the restaurant does take-out. So inflexible. 
In terms of the food, the beef noodle and the dandan noodle were average, kung pao chicken was horrible. The prices almost double the usual prices at normal Chinese restaurants. We later found that Bally's had a Chinese noodle restaurant as well, much better prices. 
While we were eating, the restaurant was only half full too but still made people wait outside. Just because you have a good location does not mean you can treat customers like this. If people werent starving, why would they come to an obviously overpriced Chinese restaurant in Vegas? Btw, what kind of expensive Chinese restaurant does not offer tea?"}
{"text":"The staff rushed us to make an order telling us \" Kitchen is closing\" - this was at 10:10 pm and the sign says that they are open till 10:30. The waiter brought out each item as it was prepared leaving several persons at the table uncomfortably  eating as others waited for their food. Several item that we ordered did not show up and  when we questioned out waiter we were told that kitchen is closed in a  VERY RUDE manner.  The food ( what we got ) was good but this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had...."}
{"text":"Very poor service and sub par food. The hand pulled noodles is what lured me into this noodle shop but after having the real deal in Beijing, was very disappointed here. 
This is basically a noodle spot open 24/7 that caters to the tourists and overly toasted Vegas clientele. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because of atmosphere and location.   If it was based on how much I enjoyed the food, it would be one star.   I have had better food from the noodle bowl places in strip malls.   Panda Express would be rated higher than this."}
{"text":"If you love noodles definitely check this place out! It was hard to decide which dish to go with. I narrowed it down to two. The dumplings are amazing and the noodles are to die for."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed in this place.  Quite.

We read that this restaurant was one of the 50 Essential Restaurants to eat at in Las Vegas, so we checked it out for lunch today.  After our experience, I'm not sure why it made the book.

They do have a nice decor going on.  The fish tanks and swirly, all-encompassing walls/ceiling are pretty cool.  You also get to see them making the noodles, which was fascinating.

But I didn't go there to look at the place, I went there to eat.  At first glance of the menu, I was blown away by the prices.  Super duper expensive for noodles.  We settled on a large order of noodles with pork and mushrooms (which cost $26).  

When the bowl came, we were dismayed to see there were only 2 pieces of pork in the entire dish, both about the size of a domino.  The noodles were literally about 2 feet long and almost impossible to get out of the bowl and eat.  I will say that the dish was tasty, but spending almost $30 to get a bowl of ridiculously hard to eat noodles and 2 pieces of meat was infuriating.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not good at all!!!!  It's beautiful, but don't be fooled by that.  Nothing was that good there, it was edible, but nothing great."}
{"text":"The food here is not bad I would give it three and half to four star on the food. The service however is horrible probably one star. I still eat here quite a bit because I play at Caesars. Some of my favorite is the duck shredded noodle soup and the Shanghai steamed dumplings."}
{"text":"Pros:  great service

Cons: extremely expensive ($99 for kobe beef noodle soup... Seriously!?), super salty, decor made me dizzy

I would not come back here again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were hesitant about going here after reading the reviews on the customer service. However, the hostesses and waiters were all friendly.

Also, the food was super good. You could tell the noodles were made fresh right there. We sat at the bar, so it was fun watching them manipulate the noodle dough.

The only thing is if you sit there, you will be close to the banging of the dough on the counter. The noise can get piercing, but it's worth watching."}
{"text":"I couldn't even wait for the check to come, I ran out halfway through the meal and puked my soul out. Sorry Caesar's Palace bathroom."}
{"text":"Very cool interior BUT the food's gotta go.

It's bad.  Bad & expensive = a big NO NO.

We got the beef noodle bowl.  Big mistake.  The flavorless broth desperately needed some salt, or something.  Chow mein noodles and tiny slivers of beef are the only other ingredients.   Never again.

Braised tofu and veggies was $14.  I guess that's what you can expect to pay at a chinese joint inside the Caesars.  The portion was really small and the sauce wasn't very good.  Never again.

The only 'okay' dish was the cold beef appetizer.  Basically it's a marinated shank that's been boiled, then chilled, then sliced thinly with some cilantros thrown on top.  The portion was surprisingly generous and it tasted ok.  

Overall, this place is a disappointment.  The noodle joint at the Bellagio is WAY better.  2 stars for the appetizer and the trippy decor."}
{"text":"If you are craving for Chinese food at Caesars, this one fits the need. The ambience is very impressive. White, light elite background with gold fish tanks  give it a very soothing effect. You can sit next to the chef and see how the Dim Sums are prepared. The staff is warm and friendly. The food is good. The General Tao chicken is very tasty - I'd recommended that. I guess they add something to the sauce that makes it very tasty. I ate here for three consecutive days as I was addicted to it. The serving size could be increased a bit more given than its an expensive place. Overall, a nice restaurant which will not disappoint you. Definitely, a better option if you are waiting for more than 45 minutes for the Buffet."}
{"text":"Is it worth the long wait: NOT AT ALL

So disappointed with this place. Really expensive and the flavors are very bland. We got the Beijing zha jiang noodles, eggplant noodles, and beef noodles. None of them were good or worth the money. The soup dumplings were better but still mediocre. The Panda Express across the street even tasted better. 

I will not be coming back or recommending this place to others."}
{"text":"Visiting Beijing Noodle No. 9 was a little bit of a homecoming for me because it's at the same space where I had my first Vegas fine dining experience 15 years ago when it was known as 808, a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant.  Well, Beijing Noodle isn't exactly same restaurant but I had a decent experience here.

I don't see how this place can get less than 3 stars.  It's a very clean and hip looking spot.  The decor with the fish tanks is very eye-popping for a noodle house (http://bit.ly/1FsSJd0).  How can you not want to go inside and check it out?  Plus its got an open noodle kitchen which was genius for them to put out in the front so you can see the chefs show off their noodle pulling skills which is almost like a Vegas show in itself (http://bit.ly/1MU6Sp7).  It was a total no-brainer for me to sit at the noodle bar to see them work on the noodles from start to finish (http://bit.ly/1H4K5IY).

On to the food.  So obviously I came here because I woke up with a craving for noodles.  I opted for the Pork Wonton Noodle Soup with Knife-shaved noodles and ordered a Thai Iced Tea for my drink.

Thai Iced Tea -- http://bit.ly/1BtOnqQ
It's pretty much your basic Thai Iced Tea.  Nothing too fancy or subtle about it.  But it was a little pricey though at $7.

Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Broth with Knife-Shaved Noodles -- http://bit.ly/1GxRP31
Even though I was impressed with the chefs making the handpulled noodles, I settled with the Knife-shaved noodles with the Pork Wonton soup.  And just was entertaining as the handpulled noodles were, I was just was impressed seeing the chef shaving off the noodles from a huge hunk of noodle dough into the cooker.  So they were definitely fresh as well.  Overall, the Pork Wontons and Noodles were great.  My issue was that the broth really had no flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything so I had to add extra soy and chili sauce to give it a little kick.

So overall Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a decent casino noodle house.  I came here to satisfy my noodle craving and it did just that with some professional noodle-pulling showmanship as a plus.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes.  It is pricey though but convenient if you have a craving for noodles on the Strip and don't want to take a bus or cab ride to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I hate giving one stars but I really can't give my meal more than that. I got the Beef Brisket noodle soup and it was really bad. Noodles seemed a bit undercooked but the brisket was where this soup truly failed. I am not a fan of gelatinous masses with slight hints of stringy beef. It could possibly be that I am just completely uncultured and this is what the beef is supposed to be (I am white so that is quite possible) but my husband is Japanese and he took a bite of the beef from my soup and immediately spit it right out. Yes, it was that bad for both of us. Service was a C - no refills and we had to wait a bit but have definitely had worse service. Other dishes might be good but this review is based solely on my dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   The noodle dishes are amazing.   Never have we had what looked like simple noodles taste so delicious.   A simple dish of just vegetables were one of a kind.  Walking through a sea of goldfish upon entering the dining room is a treat in itself.   I must go every time I'm  in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Im sorry for those folks who wait for over one hour to dine at the creepiest place ever... In one of the fanciest casinos in Las Vegas. Food was tasteless and service was descriminate."}
{"text":"Before you read too far, you should know that I didn't even get to eat here. I signed up with the hostess for a party of two. She told me it would be a 15 minute wait and that they would text me. An hour later, I'm sitting at another Asian restaurant having a delicious late lunch...and I'm still waiting on that text.
The hostess was rude, and there's no room for that here in Vegas. 
There are literally a million choices on where you can eat, and as patrons, we control who we give our money to. Poor service is intolerable in the food and service industry.

I'd be surprised if you could walk by this place in Caesars and not notice the huge fish tanks filled with hundreds of goldfish, it's unreal.  People stop just to take pictures of the tanks.

We came in to grab some dinner and I have to say I honestly wasn't expecting much based on the yelps I read.  My experience was nothing like everyone else.  Our server was nice and friendly, the menu was big, the atmosphere was ultra cool, and the food rocked.

The one downside was that the food did take a few minutes longer than I expected, but when it did finally come, boy was it worth the wait!

Would I go here again?  If I ever stay at Caesars again, sure.

Should you go here?  Yes, it's pretty darn good Chinese.

{"text":"Food was really good, and fresh.
Surprisingly fast, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"OMG, the reviews of this establishment are DEAD WRONG. This awesome spot is open 24 hours a day right smack dab in the middle of the amazing Caesars Palace. Not too big and not to small, we came in late night for a bite. In all honesty, I was a bit hungover from the night before. I ordered the dumplings, they are made to order, by hand and took a little longer to hit the table. My family ordered two beef stew, Kung Pao Chicken (no peanuts) and a pancake wrap. Excuse me that I don't remember the fine details. It's Vegas, I had a bit too much fun the night before and I really wanted to crawl back into bed. 
When our food came, literally- the heavens opened and the choir of angels sang. My dumplings were amazing little purses of flavor. My sister was able to share a slice of this pancake that immediately made me regret my choice as well. The stew, with it's hand pulled noodles, rich beefy broth soothed me. And my dad, his Kung Pao chicken.. to die for. I came to life. Suddenly, I was okay and thought to myself, this is a bit of heaven. I wish I had ordered more. 
After getting home, I found a few celebrity/ food network shows that had visited and sang praises to this place. They were right on the money. If you want, authentic Chinese cuisine- go here and take a chance. They take pride in making food that pleases your soul. No, it's not American-ized. It's good Northern Chinese food, done right and good in a small, but delicious space. The staff is super friendly (my sister had fun taking photos of the girls making noodles) and willing to help you choose something you will like. No shortcuts. Seriously good food made from scratch, authentic and they don't mind if you want a few tweaks to fit your taste. Relax, good food takes a little more time so use those extra minutes to smile, talk to your friends and just breathe. Vegas is so fast pace... this place is certainly a \"stop and smell the roses/ dumplings\" place. Nearly impossible to leave unhappy."}
{"text":"Food was very good and tasty. No complaints at all about the quality or flavors of the food.
 The only reason why it was not a 5 star is because of the servers. They where not very nice or attentive to your needs. We had to wait a good 10 mins after we where done with our meal for a server to just walk by close enough for us to get his attention to ask for our check. Even then it took another good 5 mins just for us to get them. The restaurant was not busy at all by any means so they couldn't use that as an excuse.  
The decor of the restaurant was very nice and different. I loved the restaurants atmosphere and food. Would probably consider coming back next time I'm in vegas. But not my favorite spot in vegas for noodles."}
{"text":"Whenever I would wait for the Bacchanal Buffet, I would come admire the goldfish tanks or stare in awe at the noodle chef. Finally I said NO to the buffet and tried out the food here. I love the interior decor. Makes me feel like I'm eating noodles in a futuristic world. 

The service is the same kind of service you would get in an Asian restaurant. The waiters could use a smile on their face, but that doesn't bother me. My order was taken quickly and my food arrived moments later. 

I simply ordered the wonton noodle soup. There were plenty of wontons in my portion and they were flavorful. The noodles were made perfectly and the broth was the right temperature. I really liked my dish. I wouldn't mind coming here again if I wasn't in the mood for buffet."}
{"text":"The food is just bland, and this is not ok when you sell $20 plates of noodles. Absolutely no reason to go to this place, even if you feel like chinese food."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is its open 24/7 and it's pretty and clean but other than that the food is okay and way too over priced. Most of the food taste bland and greasy. My friend ordered \"crispy chicken\" when it came out it was basically a 30 dollar chicken Katsu pretty funny. We also ordered shrimp and egg fried rice the portion was so small. Maybe they assumed that we won't eat that much because it's two tiny asian girls and they didn't want to waste food. lol we were better off going to Panda Express or pho Kim long. I would say the salt and pepper shrimp is pretty good though."}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. The mongolian beef entree was so delicious, maybe the best I have ever had. Try the margarita with pineaplle and cranberry, so delicious. Attentive staff and friendly. I would go back"}
{"text":"The beef noodle is terrible. It is fake beef noodle. The soup of beef noodle taste like adding too much water."}
{"text":"BEST. HOT AND SOUR SOUP. EVER 

Ate this place 3 days straight because of their hot and sour soup!!!! I never ever in my life had a seafood hot and sour soup and it was so delicious. I couldn't get brought of it!! Their general tso was good as well but I think you can only get that via room service...unless I didn't see it in the menu at the restaurant. I think I literally tried everything on the menu and nothing really impressed me except the hot and sour soup. All the other foods just tasted like typical Chinese food...except it's expensive (for a Chinese food) 

The interior is odd but unique. The front entrance pathway is filled with a goldfish tanks and the whole restaurant is white. When I dined in at the restaurant, I didn't think the food was as good as when I got room service. Maybe it was because a different chef?! But if your ever in Vegas, they their Hot and Sour soup. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Disappointed they have completely removed the knife-shaved noodle from their menus. That was literally the best thing they had on their menu and the reason why I even went to this restaurant! Horrible idea to do this!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Caesar's Palace and is fairly close to the main hotel check-in area. The decor is pretty cool and not atypical of Chinese restaurants.  The service and food were both excellent. Prices are expensive but inline with Vegas. We had wonton noodle soup, sliced beef/turnip with hand pulled noodle soup, roast duck, shrimp dumplings, chicken fried rice and spare ribs with black bean sauce.  The only thing we didn't like were the ribs. If you are looking for good Chinese food in a casual setting, this is probably one of the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.

This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.

For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.

For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. 

The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.

Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.

This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown."}
{"text":"When reminiscing upon my experience at Beijing Noodle No. 9, one of my standard catchphrases comes to mind - UGH.  My friends had chosen it based on convenience, since we were staying in the hotel and were already in need of a nap.  My foodie alarm definitely sounded at this appalling selection. 

The service here was very straightforward and certainly not accompanied by a smile.  The food was pretty terrible as well, with most items doused in salt.  The Sweet Red Bean Buns were perfectly moist and stuffed with the dessert-like paste.  This was the sole highlight of the meal.  The Hand-Pulled Noodles were mediocre at best and rather mushy, in actuality.  The Diced Eggplant Sauce that covered the noodles was so salty that no amount of water managed to rehydrate us.  The Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice was unmemorable and similarly salty.  The main feature that this dining establishment has going for it is the futuristic, white decor that makes you feel as if you are in a spaceship.  The beautiful fish tank also enhances the atmosphere.  However, with so many great restaurants in town, Beijing Noodle No. 9 is not worth your time...or even this rhyme!"}
{"text":"Had the noodles that are all hand made in house. We ate at the bar so didn't expect much with service but it was good and the food was great."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.
That pretty much sums it up.. Everything was okay, not great, and I don't usually have noodles with so little.. everything else, although I realize that the addition of a ton of meat is part of the Americanization of Asian food.
The dumplings were good, but I love dumplings almost all the time anyway. It was all overpriced - again, glad I didn't have to pay this time."}
{"text":"We prefer Asian and were not disappointed! The sirloin and green bean was tender and flavorful. The kung pao chicken cooked to medium and really good, even I could eat all it, not too hot. The drinks were $10 and really good!  

Prices were around $23 for a meal! We will be back! 
Asian is the only way that I can get Neal to eat his vegetables."}
{"text":"Expensive for chinese food that's just mediocre. It's in Ceasars palace and that's probably why it's so expensive. The mini wonton in chilli oil was spicy but the red chilli oil just wasn't fragrant. The noodles were bland. Texture of the noodles were good. We also had a rice porridge which was pretty good (for rice porridge). Overall, not worth the price."}
{"text":"Just so-so. When I was eating there, there was a long line and the food is not worth the waiting. I live in Beijing for 5 years and compare to all those I have, it's 3/5, maybe too harsh."}
{"text":"You can taste the quality of the food. It feels like there is some good attention to detail when it comes to preparation and cooking. This place has a great ambience and the staff is extremely attentive. The downside is that for the price you pay, the portions feel a little small. It's definitely very expensive to dine here and I probably wouldn't eat here again unless they offered larger portions."}
{"text":"This place was a welcome surprise! The decor is amazing, really beautiful and the food was delicious! I highly recommend the beef brisket noodle soup - tons of flavor in the broth and brisket that was just falling apart good."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Completely over priced the service was so aweful I was so disgusted with everything. The floors were dirty. I mean really, we went at 10:45pm and we're sorely disappointed. Food was cold , rice cost extra , the crispy chicken is a joke - I mean it was really bad.  and I have had better chowmein at the mall in the food court. PLEASE DONT EAT HERE IF YOU DO REMEMBER THIS POST. I TRIED TO WARN YOU! I travel a lot. I don't think I have given a 1 star before but this place should be a negative. If they had -5 I would rate it that. Stay away."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas and I go several times a year. It is the restaurant I recommend the most to my friends when they visit. But here's the thing, I hesitate writing this review because this place is a best kept secret. I'm so afraid that the word will get out and I will have to wait longer to get a table. Sigh. However, the good people of the world deserve to bite into the amazing roasted pork pancakes with cilantro (life changing) and the hand pulled noodles. It's been featured on multiple food shows because their food is authentic Chinese, not Americanized Chinese food like so many of us are used to. The service is below par but the food is out of this world. Go here when you have time to wait and be patient. The poor reviews here are because people don't want to wait 15 minutes for a table and another 5 minutes to get a drink. This place will give you an amazing food experience so show up without any expectations except that you will eat amazing food. On our last trip we tried several other noodle restaurants around Vegas, at Bellagio and Wynn, and none of them come close to the quality of Beijing Noodle No. 9. Make reservations and you will not wait as long. Come for lunch or early dinner and the service will be better."}
{"text":"Just came in for a quick dim sum snack. The pork and chive dimplings were really good. A bit fishy, but the sauce helped balance the flavors. The red bean buns were just ok. The bean paste was really dry and thick and sticky. (Reminded me of peanut butter consistency.) It may just be a personal preference, but I prefer red bean paste to have a lighter softer consistency. The bun part was good though."}
{"text":"Bad service, overpriced food, just don't come again. I ordered a duck and pasta, it just came with 3 pieces of duck and a bit of pasta. Terrible 

Not Satisfying, I do not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Yes, super over priced! Like most people, the buffet line was too long so had to eat here. The place is nice, but the food and service sucks.

The hostess skirt is so short that just standing I can almost see something I don't need to see.

The noodles were oily, the XLB were disgusting, most items lacked flavor. The one decent thing was the beef pancake.

Also our waitress tried to be nice, but she was up in our face. She would come to our table and stand there for a few seconds, stare at us then say something. I really wanted green onion pancake. It took forever to come. I asked twice where is my green onion pancake. The people there kept saying it's coming. Finally everyone was done eating and still no green onion pancake. I complained and the stupid lady goes \"oh you ordered that?\" I was so mad, she can see the red in my eyes and then she switced to nice mode saying how sorry she is and she will put in the order now. I said no, I want the check so I can leave. She kept saying it will be ready. I'm like NO! 

Bad service! A little too late to fix anything."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for so long, but every time I go to Vegas, I end up going to the buffet next door haha! But on my most recent Vegas trip, my friend and I got dinner here on our last night in Vegas and were pretty disappointed. The beef noodle soup was super salty, the shrimp dumplings were all mushy and had no flavor, and the fried rice... I could have made better fried rice than that! Super disappointed... I'll be going back to the buffet for now."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Vegas every 2 to 3 months for the past last 15 years.. Yet I've never felt like I'd lost in Vegas. If you ever feel like throwing your money away and you want to feel like a loser then go to this noodle place. Worst service worst tasting food and over-exaggerated prices. I ordered honey pork it came with some dry rice on the side and it cost me $28.99.
The wife got a seafood noodle dish that also cost $28.99 it had 4 pieces of cocktail shrimp two dumplings two tiny scallops and some fish cake. Very thin noodles which were semi cooked. In its entirety the whole dish tasted like fermented fish. Not so appetizing if you ask me. 

Don't get me wrong I just prices we still manage to Force this food down but we did it with no pleasure.

Like I said if you ever want to feel like you wasted money in Vegas come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't let the pretty goldfish entrance lure you in..
Chinese food should not be this expensive!! $45 for a hot pot and $20 for a 8 piece pork rib sweet vinegar sauce! AND it was NOT tasty... 
Small portion
High price
Unsatisfying taste"}
{"text":"Pros: good atmosphere. I like the fish tank decor. very modern looking/hip decor. All white walls/floor/ceiling/etc.

Cons: expensive for what it is. food tasted bland. nothing special."}
{"text":"Ate there twice on my trip to vegas, but only had noodles (once with sauce, once in a soup).
Although it's a bit pricy for chinese food, I think the prices were still ok, based on the rent they might have to pay inside Caesars Palace.
Their freshly made noodles, especially the hand stretched ones, were really yummy. And to compensate all the bad food and drinks in vegas, I recommend a healthy stay at this place."}
{"text":"Should have looked at the reviews first, but were walking from the pool and it sounded good.  We were wrong!  I sent my crispy chicken in tasteless sauce back.  The chicken was either over cooked or frozen, depending on piece.  Chicken chow mein and general tso's chicken were both awful!  Portions are tiny and price is way too high.  We all left feeling very unsatisfied and maybe a bit sick.  There are plenty of really good Chinese and Thai places that will deliver to Caesars, which cost much less and have better food.  Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"So I came to Vegas on an all girls trip and probably should have thought better than trying the Asian food. I got sucked into the beautiful interior. A huge tank full of gold fish. It was almost too much like the didn't have any room to swim.

It's well lit and wasn't busy, another red flag. There was an over abundance of waitstaff and the majority of them spoke English poorly. Took a lot time to order and get the food even though it wasn't busy.

We ordered the Hainan chicken, sautéed noodles seafood with abalone sauce, and sautéed snow pea leaves with garlic. The food definitely did not seem authentic and the portions are small. The dishes were exactly what was ordered nothing fancy, nothing more or less.

The only thing I felt was comparable to something worth ordering was the Thai iced tea but even that was overpriced.

I think we ended up spending over $60 dollars on all the above. I know its Vegas but that's just ridiculous. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night without reservations and was seated immediately. (4 adults & a baby). Ordered spring rolls for appetizers and they came out super fast! The spring rolls did not taste fresh at all. Tasted as if they were from a frozen pack.. YUCK. Our entree's came out shortly after and we were almost immediately disappointed. The \"chicken fried rice\" looked and tasted so plain... the \"Kung pao shrimp\" arrived burnt.. defiantly not worth the price at this restaurant. Not at all happy about it. 

2 stars for fast service but terrible food"}
{"text":"This is literally the worst restaurant i have ever been to.... its overpriced and tastes like garbage. It's not worth your money, trust me."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, even though it's a bit pricey. But if you order the sichuan dan dan noodles or beef noodle soup are both pretty tasty. It's quick and easy if you are on the go with things to do!"}
{"text":"My last review...

Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.  

But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.

We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.

The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....

Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice. 

I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.

Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.  

Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.  

Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business..."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place has gotten such low rating!

I can't speak for every dish but I tried their dumplings and hand-pulled mushroom noodles! The dumplings were ok but the noodles were AMAZING!!! They have a world class noodle chef! He pulls noodles competitively which probably explains why they are so delicious. Pulling noodles is an art! Just like making sushi! Good noodles are so hard to find these days... and  Beijing Noodle No. 9 hit the spot! 

Other fun fact - the interior deco of the restaurant was supposedly designed by the same guy who did the \"bird nest\" National Stadium in Beijing."}
{"text":"MUST HAVE: One of the gold fishes in the tanks because there are way to many in them for it not to be cruel!!!! 

honestly if you gave this place more than 2 stars you need to get yourself down to chinatown on spring mountain and valley view and get yourself some WONTON NOODLES @ sam woo there because mannnnn are you missing out!!!! 

first off i understand the inflated prices but $16.50 (yes, SIXTEEN FIFTY) for what taste like water with the essence of chicken broth and noodles (which ok are decent). 

honestly this place is ridiculous!!! the design of the place is cool, but the food is what you are sitting down and paying for is not even close to being worth it, save yourself $16.50 and get a box of SHIN RAMEN."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!!!! First off, Great service!!! From the time we walked in to the time we finished and left, the staff was so polite and friendly. Started off the night with beef pancake, shrimp dumplings and and beef dumplings. OMG! The beef dumpling was so juicy! It was filled with this broth and so good. Not sure witch was my fav, to hard to choose. Next came Szechuan fish, fried rice, and this fried pork with a bunch of veggies. Ok, if you like spicy food, MUST MUST MUST try the Szechuan fish!!! It was so damn good!!! I ate so much of it!!!! It really was amazing. One of the best things I've eaten in a long time. If you are looking for really good food, I would defiantly recommend Beijing Noodle No. 9. I am so full, but still want some more of that fish! LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the vegetable chow mein, Kung pao chicken, and the Beijing pork wonton in chicken broth (with hand pulled noodles). Nothing was tasty or enjoyable, the chicken was simply disgusting and tasted old. The chow mein had a smell of bad oil and the soup was even worse. The soup was bland and the dumplings were average. I've tried many soup dumplings and all exceeded these pork dumplings. The people that you see in the restaurant are tourists and I guarantee it's their first time there. It was expensive and truly a waste of money. My friend and I had an extremely unpleasant experience and won't be returning. You're better off at the Caesar's food court!"}
{"text":"So ridiculous. They have me wait over 1 1/2 hours to start. When I come to see how much longer I need to wait, hostess now decides to let me know they can seat me right away if I'm ok with just dim sum or noodles. If I want anything else, I will not be able to be seated. What is so hard about letting me know this from the start? Or give me a courtesy phone call to let me know the situation?
To top it all off, hostess is not even apologetic about the situation. They need to up their customer service. Took me over 20minutes to get her name. Minzy. If that's even her real name. Manager Lucy came out to apologize but Minzy kept trying to flame the situation by telling her she didn't do anything wrong. 
Lucy was very sweet however. Might come back just to see her. 
I would give them -5 stars if yelp allowed. Didn't even get to eat and now too pissed off to"}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
 I really like the food here and it's a frequent visit per trip, especially when I come here with my folks. They offer a variety of authentic dishes from all over China. Their \"pancakes\" are pretty decent but their best dishes are their noodles. Their hand pulled noodles are super fresh and their broth offerings are straight out of China. Definitely one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants on the strip! Also, it's rumored that their new (head, possibly not) chef is from Malaysia which specializes in Hainan chicken, so if if you see this, definitely order it. 
Service: 7/10
 Pretty standard service, nothing out of the ordinary. Very attentive and helpful when you need it!
Overall: 7/10
Additional Notes: Great place to come when you're looking for some authentic Chinese flavor. Also open 24/7 which is equally important in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here since they make their noodles in house as well as their dim sum. Sat down at the noodle bar and was instantly asked what I wanted. I told the server I just sat down and wanted to browse the menu a little. The guy told me he wanted to know what I was going to eat. Again I told him I wanted some time to look over the menu. He left for less than 30 seconds, returned with my water and iced tea and was very pushy with asking what I wanted to eat. I ordered beef chow mein. He brought it to me in less than 5 minutes. 

It was not very exciting. It came on a small plate and the portion was tiny. I usually don't need to add any soy sauce to my food when I eat out, but I had to add a lot. Not much flavor at all! The beef was tender, but the noodles were mushy. My server never returned to refill my beverage ($5 for iced tea) or my luke warm water. 

*$18 for chow mein- was excepting great things at that price since a mile down the road in China Town I can get hand pulled fresh made noodles for less than $10. 
*$5 for iced tea- which should have been refilled but he didn't come around to refill me.
*Waited 15 min after emptying my plate for my bill. 
*I was still really hungry!! :(

Yes they make all things in house, but so do many other Chinese places in town. Their menu is over priced for what you get (shumai is $10 for 4 small pieces). 

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Beijing noodle another try after the manager reached out to me and I'm really glad I did. Lucy the assistant manager apologized for the service and made sure that I got 5 star treatment when I went back. She went above and beyond to make sure that our meal was wonderful and it was. 

We were recommended to try some of their other dishes and they turned out to be great. So great, that we came back again the same night to order the same entrees! 

Now for the entrees: 

Beef noodle soup- I loved this. Braised Beef was tender, noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was super flavorful as well

Salt and pepper shrimp- this was an excellent dish because they used huge giant prawns that were delicious. Really good flavor 

Chilean sea bass and tofu clay pot. This was good too. Had a ton of flavor and I love Chilean sea bass, so this goes excellent white rice

Black pepper beef with asparagus- good flavor 

Overall, the service and the food was excellent the second time around. Make sure u order the dishes that I recommended and you won't be disappointed. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This the second time in two years that I've been to Beijing 9 and both times were horrible.  The foods not bad, what's horrible is that if you are with a group of people then food is served sporadically.  There was a twenty minute variant from when the first people received their order to when I got mine (and that's after complaining to the management)."}
{"text":"This review pretty much applies to all the noodle cafes in the Strip luxury resort-casinos because they're pretty much all the same experience.   Incidentally, this Anglo is a former long-time and informed habitue of Silicon Valley noodle places, a frequent Vegas visitor, know my way around Vegas Chinatown, always have a car to get there and know how to get there with vehicle and sanity in one piece.

You can expect luxe decor and I've always found the flavors and food quality quite adequate.   HOWEVER, the prices will be double, there can be a significant wait on weekends at any normal meal time, and the service will be the same authentically haphazard affair as at \"authentic\"  places everywhere else .    I suspect these latter considerations prime many reviewers to be more sour on the food itself than it deserves.   

There are some very nice noodle experiences in Chinatown but getting there and back  from your major strip hotel can be an experience for Vegas virgins on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"\"weigH\" overpriced and the food was mediocre at best...not much more to say...saw what appeared to be a comparable place at the Venetian - prices were 50% to 33% less than this place and looked good...will try that next time because this place sucked with a capital \"S\" and that doesn't stand for Super(man) either."}
{"text":"Fake Peking noodle, bad taste, too expensive!"}
{"text":"Physically, this place is beautiful. Im obsessed with the ceilings. The food was ok.

I go to the SGV for chinese food fairly often so of course that was my comparison. 

We ordered the soup dumplings here and that was it for me. Once i tried those, i knew the other food wouldn't be great. In all honesty, i don't remember what else we had. 

I'd save your meal for another spot in Las Vegas. There are a lot of other spots to try."}
{"text":"This place would for sure be 5 stars were it not for the prices. I understand that it is in Caesar's so you'll pay a premium, but still. Make up for it with bigger portions. We ordered the hot and sour soup. Flavor was great, but it was a little thinner than I like. More corn starch please. The spicy beef noodle soup was perfect. Literally perfect. Sit at the counter so you can watch them cook and make friends with the people back there. There was one tall dude that was really cool. He scrounged around to get me a free dessert (mango tapioca) because it was my birthday. :)"}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is inside a hotel so yes, the price will be much higher than a normal Chinese restaurant. But since we had some vouchers to use, I focused on the quality of the food. To our surprise the xiao long bao had a good amount of soup inside each one. They were served in individual tin pans so I just poured the soup into them before eating. The noodles were chewy and very tasty. The spicy noodles were very much like the Szechuan flavours.  Yum! But yes, $14 for 6 pork dumpings is more than double of what I normally pay for ......"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place the last few times we have visited Las Vegas and we finally made it.

 We were seated quickly and our server was attentive and helpful in explaining some of the menu items. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodle with hand pulled noodles and my wife ordered a veggie/tofu noodle dish as she does not eat meat. We also had vegetable egg rolls as an appetizer. All three things were very good. The egg rolls really stood out to me and they usually do not. Fried perfectly and very flavorful. Quite a suprise. 

My wife was thrilled to get a big bowl of noodles with tasty tofu and lots of vegetables. Again the waiter steered her toward this and was quite helpful. Bam, two great things she can eat without worry. This is harder to find than a carnivore may imagine. 

So this was my first time having Dan Dan Noddles, but not my last. I am a bit obsessed with them because of Beijing Noodle No. 9. I have been trying them all around San Diego since then. These are still my favorite. A bit more of a broth than most places. Spicy seasame goodness with pork and spinach. I told our server how much I enjoyed them and he brought some of the sauce without the ground pork in it so my wife could try it. Good Service.

I try to avoid commenting on price because the way I see it is that the price is there for you to see before you order. If you feel it is too expensive, don't get it. Go somewhere where you are more comfortable with the prices. I agree that the noodles I get on Convoy St. in San Diego are way cheaper than these but if you are not considering the fact that you are on the Las Vegas strip let alone, in Ceasar's Palace, well you are missing something.

We had a great time here. I discovered a dish that I now love and we will be returning here in a few days to eat there again and I cannot wait."}
{"text":"We came here as soon as we got to Vegas. We were staying at the Caesar's so figured it was the easiest way to go as we were waiting on others to arrive. The ambiance was cool, very trendy. What the wait staff was wearing did not go with that. Still can't figure out what that was. The service was decent. It took a while for us to realize that she wasn't yelling at us, she just talked that way to everyone so kind of made us feel better.
I ordered the Fried Rice. I wanted tofu in place of chicken and the waitress initially said no but when I asked her why she couldn't do it, she caved. My friends ordered a lot of dumplings which they loved. My rice was OK, it wasn't horrible but nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"I have passed by this little hole in the wall a hundred times. I thought it was a sushi joint (I was thrown off by the massive tanks full of goldfish. 

A friend talked me into trying this little gem out. We tried a variety of appetizers. The salted edamame was a clean way to start. The dumplings were bland, nothing more than you'd get at any chain Chinese restaurant. The spring rolls had a light flakey crust and had a decent flavor. 

The main dishes were larger than I expected. Each was a full plate full of food. The General Tso's Chicken was a little sweet. The sauce had a nice texture. Don't expect it to be hot, it was flavorful, but not a burner. The Kung Pow Chicken with peanuts was a nice light dinner. The peanuts added a great crunchy texture to the chicken. If you want some burn, eat the peppers. 

The hot tea was sooo smooth and light. After a hard night of drinking, it will help settle your stomach.

If you are wondering how to get here, follow the signs to the Julius Tower. It is right outside the elevator lobby."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in America. The real thing. extra bonus is they take both Chinese digital payment, WeChat Pay and Ali Pay:)"}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant. Did not have to wait long to be seated on Saturday night.  Fried rice did not have much flavour."}
{"text":"Im not going to lie this is one of the most expensive asian resturants ive been too.
but it was something different from the fast food, americam and buffet we were having in vegas. i loved the design of the resturant! very different compared to lots of other asian resturant you'll go too. expect to put out about 18-22 dollars for each plate or so for a small portion. Food was served out fast but tasted okay! serving was great!"}
{"text":"This was quite the SURPRISE. Prior to settling with eating here, my sister read the reviews to me and it appeared to be ranked at a terrible rating. In fact, they were making me kind of nervous on trying this place out. We were extremely hungry and it was getting pretty late, and my mom wanted Asian food, so we said let's do it. I AM SO GLAD WE DID. I am not a huge fan of Asian food but WOW. Everything that we ordered was DELICIOUS. Although a little over priced, everything here is way above than any Chinese Takee Outee. I ordered the Beijing Honey BBQ Pancakes and I cannot begin to describe the delightful flavors that I was experiencing. I have never tasted anything like this and it was amazing! My sister ordered dumplings and my father ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, and even though those are simple common Asian fares, THIS PLACE MADE THEM THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER HAD (Other than my mom of course haha.) GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY, You'll pay more here for what you are getting, but IT'S WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Terrible service matched by equally terrible tasting food. One person in our group received their meal 30 minutes after the rest of the group. My meal was bland and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Tbh, I came here for brunch with my family since the wait for Bacchanal was over 7 hours long on Christmas. We waited over two hours to get in hoping the food is going to be good since this place was beautifully decorated. I was SOOOOOO wrong. After we got in, we ordered hand-pulled noodles soup thinking that it was this restaurants specialty, the soup noodles (3 beef brisket/ $16 for each + chicken soup noodles) came out cold and we had to finish it bc we were extremely hungry n we were no longer have the energy to wait after the whole day traveling from California to Vegas. The bill came out $75 and it was a waste of time, money and energy. I highly not recommended this place."}
{"text":"The past 2 times ive stayed at Caesars i have ate here. There is a line...and it is long. So if you're going to go for it i suggest u bring patience. If you have a Diamond Total Rewards card you go right to the front of a seperate line. Worked out for me. Im assuming a lot of bad reviews were influenced by the wait in line. The chef makes the food fresh and for all to see that wish to. Its pretty cool. They seem a little understaffed which leaves u with longer waitress waits. They food is great though! Nice variety with fair pricing. I had the seafood lo mein and would definitely have it again. I'll be back there soon and will most likely stop in!"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat buffet but with two toddlers, there was no way. We settled for lunch next door. The place was able to seat us after a few minutes and we dined on eggplant stir fry, onion pancake, fried rice with picked daikon and a few dishes I can't remember. We ate well, flavors better than we expected but the price was outrageous. The onion pancakes were only a few slices and not even a full circle! Would've been the same dining at the buffet if we didn't have to wait. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Overpriced . Small portions . Very Americanized chinese food . One star for the white decor and another star for the goldfish aquarium ."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Had to wait 20 minutes on a Saturday but worth it!! Now service was fair they kind of take their sweet time but made up for it with the food!! 

  This place is soo cool!! All white it is decorated as if inside a bird's nest. There
The front if the restaurant is for the I guess I'll call regular eating. Then the back is for the Hot Pot at the table. Kind if like shabu shabu.  

 Now the food part. Appetizer Beijing Soup Dumplings and Beef and Honey BBQ Pork pancake. Like the pancake more. Then entree I had Beef Brisket Soup with hand noodles and Husband had Stir Fry Lamb with cumin and brown rice. My son had steamed BBQ Pork buns 2 orders he loved it. 

So, overall casual place with great food!!  So, come in and  enjoy.  Also,  noodles are hand tossed. Amazing to watch while you wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I don't understand why some people bitching about pricy fried rice, lo mein or general tao chicken. Especially the Asians.  I would slap you silly if you order these fake and cheap Chinese food at a hand pulled noodle restaurant. Yes, the food is pricy. Hello! you are at Vegas and in the Caeser Palace. So suck it up! Got to make those dollars rain in Vegas.  I might want to complain about my $7 Thai Iced Tea but I am just going to suck it up because it is Vegas. 

Long waiting....I do recommend to make a reservation before you eat here! 

I just love the atmosphere here! The decoration is absolutely chic.  

Definitely order hand pulled noodles here! I am still craving it till this day. I really hope Utah would have a hand pulled noodles restaurant soon. One thing, the noodle portion was not enough. We had to order extra noodle to fill up our stomachs. 

Service was ok. Long as server check on us when they are busy, we are fine. 

I'll be back! ::Imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger::"}
{"text":"This place is awful and I can't even believe Caesars palace allows this place to stay in business. When I think of quality I think of Caesars and this was not it. 
I have been there before and it wasn't that good so i thought maybe they were having an off day but it seems that's standard operating procedure. 
We had the beef brisket noodle soup and it was awful. The beef was 3 chunks of boney fatty I don't even want to call it beef that would be an insult to the cow.
The soup was cold! It's a noodle company according to the name and they can't even warm up the soup?! 
For $16 I could of eaten an entire smorgasbord in Chinatown for that price.
I also had the red bean bun and it was the worst red bean bun I have ever had. 
You can go into Chinatown and have dim sum and get the best red bean buns at Orchid Garden. 
If I was from Beijing I would be insulted that they were trying to pass this off as something from there. 
It was very disappointing. 
I guess I'm gonna have to go to Chinatown to get a descent bowl of noodles and hand made red bean buns."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Ignore the haters. Most of their complaints are about service at midnight. What do you expect at late night eat in Vegas?? Seriously, beggars cannot be choosers. 

First off, I came here with my family are normal dining hours. The food is legit. It's high quality Szechwan style cuisine with hand cut noodles. For my Asian food lovers, you will not be disappointed. They use real Szechwan spices. If you traveled to Beijing and Shanghai, you could appreciate these flavors. 

Yes, it is a little pricey... but what do you expect when you come to Caesar and order Chinese food. Imagine what their rent is!! 

Get the dan dan noodles, Zha Jang noodles, eggplant w/ green beans, shrimp dumplings, and salt and pepper shrimp. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oooo, lawd! I don't know what the hell all these people giving negative reviews are talking about. The prices are too high! Wait, really? You mean, this restaurant in Caesar's Palace that handmakes noodles is NOT CHEAP? Get over it. It's not pricey, either, Homeslice. I found the portions to be exactly what is expected for the amount paid. Especially considering the super cool fish tanks and decor. Oh, and that whole handmade noodle thing. 

I had a noodle soup with sliced beef that was just wonderful, all-around. The taste was surprisingly perfect...I don't normally get that in noodles. But, the broth had a distinct seasoning that I really enjoyed. I also had a pot of hot jasmine floral tea that went nicely with the rest of the meal.

I would disregard the Yelpers before (no offense...). Had I not, I would've missed out on one of the better meals I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I forgot how expensive food in Vegas can be until I looked at this place's menu. 

When you're serving average Chinese food (a shade better than Panda Express) and each dish is around $20 a pop, you know you're in Vegas.

The only reason we justified eating here was because a relative had it comp'ed."}
{"text":"The webpage for this restaurant has a splash photo that depicts two Asian women sitting in front of the chef's counter, toasting their drinks with merriment to what is ostensibly the start of a night filled with mega turnt #selfies in \"Vegas, bitches!\"

Then you notice some shit.

You notice the presence of the uncanny valley, eerily tucked into the botox-frozen veneers of the two silicone enhanced, Bebe-minidress-bedecked Chinese fembots. You notice that for some reason these Stepford wifeys have five neon-colored drinks set out for just two neon-colored people. You notice the chef, with his dead mackerel eyes and creepy, all-upper-teeth grin looks EXACTLY LIKE THE DUDE LO PAN FROM \"BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA\" and is pulling apart what are supposed to be some tasty noodles but are CLEARLY the pearly white remnants of an immigrant culture's broken dreams.

BUT broken dreams are what Vegas is made of, amirite? Our server said to us, \"people come here because they like the experience of a real Hong Kong style restaurant\" and I was like NAH YO I checked that privilege at the door when I saw the Chun Li waitress costumes and $20 price tag for a bowl of congee. Fuckouttahere with that. BUT when you're eyeballs-deep in a hangover after one too many mega turnt #selfies from the night before, that congee and a pot of jasmine tea is a godsend, even if you're getting price gouged in a tweaker's funhouse version of a real Chinese restaurant. Vegas, bitches!"}
{"text":"Very reasonable food for a quick meal during a crowded conference and event. Prices are normal and service is relatively good."}
{"text":"Don't be lured in by the trippy decor and fish in walls. It's a trap.

This experience was one of the strangest I've encountered. I don't think anyone spoke full English, the service was so bad it was funny, overpriced takeout...my food came out at least 15 mins after the rest of my party--no apologies or real acknowledgement of the situation.

I am pretty laid back but I honestly can't find a good think to say about this place except the fabulous decor.

Sorry guys, step up your game!"}
{"text":"Cool decor (as you would expect in Vegas). I had the beef chow fun and the noodles themselves were good but the dish overall was pretty bland. All of the other food that was put out on tables next to me didn't look too impressive either. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is a casual resturant with moderate prices. The decor is bright and modern, but may not appeal to everyone. Also, the tables for two are very small, and you may feel a little cramped when the food comes out. The food was overall tasty, and the portions were good. The shumai appitizer was very good, but the General Tso's chicken had no chillie peppers, so it lacked the usual hot spicy taste. I noticed other tables ordered some dishes that looked very good. So maybe if you order the right dish, you will enjoy it more than I did. Overall, I would say this place is ok for lunch, if your at Caesars. But I would not make a special trip if your not at the hotel."}
{"text":"The food is edible, the fish tanks are great, the noodle tossing and making show was not bad either.  But if you love to eat, I'd not go here.  It's sad, but it's true.  The buns and noodles are too mushy.  It is not Caesars Palace standard. :("}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a quick bite if you are craving some noodle soup or sake/beer. Especially if you are staying at Ceasar's, since it's right in the lobby of the casino. The decor is unique, but do not  come here hungover as the bright lights, white decor and double layered 3-d style walls/ceiling will make you dizzy. Not to mention the thousands of goldfish swimming around int he gigantic tanks. The noodles are good, especially with a good amount of the chili sauce to spice it up. The dumplings are ok, nothing to rave about. Again, great for a stop-by if you are staying here, but I wouldn't go out of my way or make reservations or anything. If you can spare the extra time, go find some real good food in the forum shop restaurants instead."}
{"text":"Ordered the duck fried rice for $30 and there was hardly any duck. Also asked what was in the beef shank noodle soup and the server said it was only beef and noodles. Came topped with cilantro and green onion and was not told. Also ordered soup dumplings and was not told how hot they would be and burned my entire mouth. Didn't come with chili oil as I asked, and only came with 6 dumplings for almost 20 bucks. Would pick any other restaurant in Caesars Palace besides this one and we should have just went to the Ramen place in the food court."}
{"text":"Let me start with the decor - It is modern. It is attractive. It is bright inside. It is goldfishy. Some of the fishes are upside down (they look dead, really!) but still breathing. Umm, is it just me that think that is cruel?

Mr. Chang our server and waiter was great. He was welcoming and attentive. He was not too pushy and definitely had a sense of humor. The food is alright. Not the best, but not the worst. Come here on an empty stomach or drunk and the food will be delicious. I can't remember all the dishes we ordered, but I left satisfied nonetheless.

The chow mien noodle dishes and fried rice are decent, not bland and not oily like other Chinese restaurants in Vegas. The Ma Po Tofu and Kung Pao Chicken dish are good with just the right amount of spices. The Sauteed Seasoned Vegetable are also good, not oily at all. The Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs are ok, not dry and easy to chew. 

For a party of 12 we ate family style and each paid $20. We didn't order a lot, so expect to pay more to be full if your eating family style."}
{"text":"The environment was very modern deco. The goldfish aquariums lining the entrance was very cool. I wish we would have came for dinner just to see the lights on the goldfish.

We ordered the chef special noodle to share between my wife and I and about 3 dim sum dishes. For dim sum, the dishes were EXPENSIVE (roughly $7-$9 per dish) but what can you expect in Vegas? These dishes would normally cost an avg of perhaps $2-$5 in a normal dim sum joint.

Nothing extremely fancy nor super tasty, but good enough to satisfy the dim sum urge without leaving the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Dim sum was great ... Hand tossed noodles were good but not with the chicken and mushrooms as the mushrooms over powered everything else"}
{"text":"I really like the decor. White swirls cover the entire ceiling and walls and create rounded corners. Several large goldfish tanks add motion and orange colors to the white surroundings. The orange and white is mirrored in the polka dots of the glasses. The orange is also found on the hostess and in the uniforms of the waiters.

The prices are higher than an average Chinese restaurant but you are in Vegas. This was one of the cheapest satisfying meals that we found all weekend. For the same price as one crepe at Payard, you can have a full meal.

Note that there is the bar up front, small tables in the back, and large round tables for groups.

GOOD: We had the pork wontons in chicken soup. The wontons tasted very fresh, as did the bokchoy. It was around $10 and is easily a full meal for one person.  

GOOD: seafood dumplings with soup inside"}
{"text":"First time trying pulled noodle. It was nice and chewy. The food was ok nothing spectacular. I do love their green onion pancake. Definitely try the Beijing pulled noodles."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, food was ok but I will not go back due to having to flag down someone and begged for service every time we needed something. I was amazed and appalled to have to do this at such a nice place inside a nice hotel."}
{"text":"I've never had to wait long here but that being said expect to wait at any decent restaurant on the strip on a weekend. 

I have been a few times and had a variety of things but since this is a noodle place with hand pulled noodles I always get a noodle dish.

I've had the cold appetizer platter, green onion pancake,  tomato and egg noodles,  cold noodles, seafood noodle soup all very good.

The only thing I didn't love were the soup dumplings and I normally like those.

The service can be a bit slow at times but overall the food is very good.  Plus they get bonus points from me for the great green onion pancakes."}
{"text":"Why a 3 you ask? 

Well the food is really quite good as long as you don't go to Panda Express or PF Changs' expecting authentic home-cooked Chinese food. The noodles here are fresh and you can see them making the noodles by hand in the front window all day long. As you would expect in a place like this... the noodle dishes come out lightening quick and the food is above average. 

The downside is the high (even for vegas standards) prices. What more would you expect for a restaurant situated in Caesars (smack dab in the middle of the strip). The decorations and ambiance is quite different than most Chinese places as it is quite bright and feels spacious. 

So when you are rolling big in Vegas... or a getting comped... or really in the mood for some authentic Chinese food... make your way into Beijing Noodle No. 9!"}
{"text":"I did not go here by choice.  In fact I was completely opposed to going here and was on my way to another establishment, but I was semi-forced to go here by the group I was with.  Big mistake on both fronts, especially since I already saw the yelp reviews...

Overpriced, even for Vegas.  Most dishes were in the $18-$20 range and were nothing special.  My chicken mushroom noodles were actually decent noodles, but everything else was bland and sort of greasy.  How do they have all that grease/oil and not much flavor?

The service was decent, but not great (I realize sometimes you are paying for service at places like this, but the service wasn't very good, not rude or dismissive or anything like that, just not great).

The interior is pretty nice I guess, so at least there is something to look at.  I tried another dish and it was also bad.  It was really fishy and even the shrimp wasn't good.  It was some seafood wonton soup.  The wontons were pretty good, but the rest of the dish including the noodles and the brother were yuck!

I will never return, but I will return to Cesars in Las Vegas.  Even if I am with a group who wants to go here, I will make up an excuse to go gamble and not attend.

I don't mean for this review to be hateful in any way.  I just don't think this restaurant tries very hard and there is no excuse for the prices being so high.  Do yourself a favor and head next door to Earl of Sandwich or venture into the forums shops and go to cheesecake factory.  I heard Gordon Ramsay's isn't bad and they have a great selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was dicey.  The waiters would congregate behind a service counter to debate. You had to get their attention by staring at them or making some sort of hand sweep. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars, but it won't let me.  Horrible service and servers who couldn't recommend anything more than what was the most expensive item on the menu. Then we  have the below sub oar food. Panda express is better than this. Don't waste your time and  money."}
{"text":"Service needs a major overhaul, however the food was pretty good.

The pancake with honey BBQ pork was really tasty, though a bit difficult to eat. 

The sauteed shrimp appetizer was so delicious -- my favorite!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Szechuan cuisine in a great funky atmosphere! Not a single dissappointment of the 8 diashes we ordered. Our server was super friendly and helped guide us through the extensive menu of one of a kind dishes."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck there are places in Chinatown, the Rio and Gold Coast that would provide a similar quality dish at a more reasonable price. 

The ambiance is definitely trendy and the food comes out freakishly fast and freakishly out of order. We placed an order for two items only since we happen on this by chance and it was a late brunch tie-me-over than a proper meal. The items ordered were Steam BBQ pork buns and a Kung Pow Chicken.

Kung Pow Chicken came within 7 minutes if ordering. Freakishly fast. While the BBQ Pork buns.... I am still waiting for them as I write this review with an empty plate in front of me from the chicken."}
{"text":"This place is not only one of the coolest looking restaurants in Las Vegas the food is fantastic too!!  A great experience.  The Soup Dumplings are out of this world and noodles are hand made and delicious too!!"}
{"text":"We ordered their Stir-Fried Vegetables which should've included Asparagus, Baby Bok Choy, Chinese Broccoli AND Choy Sum. But this is what we received (see photo). I did not see 'OR' anywhere on the menu. This looked like a horrible side dish. First time here. Last time here. Decor matches their food. What made things worse was that they stereo typed us and gave us forks without asking. The next table was an Oriental family and they gave them chopsticks.  
I should've known to pass this place when there were a lot of empty seating.
With all the Noodle/Asian options here in Vegas, don't even bother with this one."}
{"text":"Happy to find a place serving dim sum. Turned out Beijing Noodle No. 9 wasn't half bad. BBQ pork buns were very good, soup dumplings were good but lacked a flavor, and the egg rolls were mushy. Service was okay having had to track down the waiter a couple of times. Would love to try some of the noodles. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Overpriced. Ordered the beef brisket and beef tendon soup. Broth was bland. My soup had a tiny piece of beef brisket and the rest was tendon. My buddy chewed a piece of tendon for 5 minutes, surprised he didn't get lock jaw"}
{"text":"Was at Caesar's in Las Vegas for a conference and kept walking by this place.  You can see the chef making hand-pulled noodles right in the front of the restaurant when you walk by.  Since I love hand-pulled noodles, I had to try it.  My colleague and I ordered a few dishes to share.  We tried the beef shank and cilantro roll, pork won-tons in numbing oil, and wok-fried hand-pulled noodles with shrimp.  The beef shank was a bit dry but tasted pretty good - the pancake was thin and rolled up nicely.  The won-tons were plenty numbing from the Szechuan peppercorn oil but the dumplings themselves were tiny and had very little filling.  The shrimp noodles contained a fair number of medium-sized shrimp but that was the only good thing about the dish which was otherwise bland tasting and bland looking, with over-cooked (too soft) noodles.  This place is expensive too - I guess it's not to surprising given its location next to the conference center at Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"A hand pulled Chinese noodle shop in a Las Vegas hotel?  Gotta be a fake, right?  Wrong - this is actually pretty authentic stuff.

We tried a few of their noodle dishes - all thick round wheat noodles.  In the beef broth, as well as panfried, and with the eggplant sauce.  I have to say the dishes are solid.

Good selection and good price range, although the noodle dishes are VERY LIGHT on the protein quotient.  So if you order the beef broth noodles, do not expect anything more than 1 serving of beef.  Well, the noodles should fill you up though.

Wait staff is ok, but the hostess is SNOTTY.  One of those pretty skinny dolled up Asian girls with enormous attitude.  Your basic nightmare.  Go for the food (if you're stuck on the strip), oogle the goldfish, and ignore the hostess.  That's my recommendation."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! They are so unbelievably rude. I've honestly never experienced and witnessed such an unhappy pissed off restaurant staff in my life. I didn't even feel they deserved a tip, and I've never felt that way ever before. Although I admit the food was very good, the service and overpriced dishes will keep me from ever returning. When I'm craving Asian food, I will stick with Wazuzu at Encore."}
{"text":"It was so promising.  I love noodles!  I had the beef and tendon soup, it was incredibly lacking in tendon.  It had about 5 chunks of tender, well seasoned beef in a decent broth, but where is the tendon?  I was craving gooey, gelatinous blocks of tendon, I got nothing.  The noodles were mealy and undercooked.  At a noodle house, I would expect the noodles to be cooked well.  These were awful.  The gai lan was delicious, with buttery garlic sauce.  I tried some other dishes, kung pao chicken was ok, the general tsao chicken was a fried, mushy bland mess.  Eh, I wasn't impressed.  The decor is awesome, service was nice, the food just isn't great."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a whim and it was very good especially the hand pull noodles which is a dying art. But the type of food they are serving was/is Street Food and should be on the cheap about a half the price for what you are paying ( WTH!!! $9.09 for 4 pcs of Haw Gow Shrimp dumplings) I guess the rents gotta be paid! Service speed was terrible after the foods been delivered, took a long time to get a refill. The decor was interesting and sparse, it reminded me Wong Kar Wai's movie 2046. It would be a better value if it was not so expensive."}
{"text":"Honestly,  I've never been so disgusted.  But,  first...
We ordered 3 things:  hand-cut jah jeing noodle,  bbq pork pancake,  and shrimp and pork dumpling.  The noodles were ok, though I've had much better (tastier and cheaper) in LA. The pancake was on the salty side,  but plenty of meat.  And,  lastly,  well,  the dumpling were very heavy and hard. 

However,  the most disturbing part was watching a server clear a table to our left.  3 minutes later she must have realized that they weren't finished and she went BACK IN THE TRASH (bus bin) to take out the food and put it back on the table.  As she was doing it another server came by and chatted,  knowing what was happening,  and gave direction about what to do.  I was dumbfounded.  Seriously... makes me worry about the ethics ood the rest of the establishment.  Sorry but this is a definite SKIP it!"}
{"text":"Replace the cook. Pretty bad service (\"we don't have fried vegetables as a side order\"). Crispy duck was fatty, bony and raw (waitress exchanged it with spicy chicken which was oversalted). It is also unreasonably expensive. In one word: avoid."}
{"text":"My wife and I needed a quick bite one evening after arriving at Caesars 
We ordered a noodle soup and vegetable dumplings 
After 5 minutes of enjoying our meal the waiter brings over a plate of noodles with shrimp and tells me I ordered it 
No way did I order it 
He argues with me and takes it away
I see him talking to another waiter who turns around and looks at me 
When the check comes 
He changed the price of my soup to cover his mistake 
Making the bill significantly higher 
I tell a manager who adjusts the bill and apologizes 


Terrible service 
Dirty floor --- this restaurant needs someone to clean up food droppings  off the floor 
I will only eat there when there are few or no other choices 

Food is tasty 
Fresh ingredients 
Nice spicing"}
{"text":"The place has a great look or decor.  It was the first thing we noticed about the place.  It wasn't that busy. There were many tables open, but it took about 10 minutes for me and my family to get seated. We ordered two different dim sum dishes and two dishes from the regular menu.  The dim sum dishes were wonderful (steamed bbq pork buns and shrimp dim sum), the regular dishes we ordered (fried rice and chow main), were okay.  The food was overpriced, for the quantity and the quality of dishes we received.  We only had water to drink, and one of my daughters had a Thai iced tea. The $96 bill was not worth it.  I can get better Chinese food elsewhere for about $40."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times. The food was acceptable, better than standard American Chinese food. Don't be fooled by the hand stretch noodle commercial they put on 24 hours, not that great. And you have to pay triple the price. If you are into real Chinese food, drive a couple minutes to China town. This place is a place for desperate suckers like me and my family stuck at Caesar's palace, in the middle of the night. Well, then you are really out of choice. 
The service here seems pretty slow, maybe depends on what you ordered. I remember there was one time we ate here, the food came pretty slow we were almost late for the Celine Dion concert. 
Again, this place should be the last option for Asian food."}
{"text":"The decor reminded me of being inside a refridgerator.  Or an asylum.
It's disorientating and unsettling   The noodles weren't hot enough,  temperature-wise and they were greasey and tasteless.  The buns were semi-warm too.   If they're going to charge $15.09 for a bowl of semi-warm food noodles they should at least season and reheat before serving."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend that you visit this great handmade noodle house. Extremely thin and light is the result of all the beautiful homemade noodles. Wontons in numbing chili oil.  All of the  noodle soup dishes were spectacular. My only negative remark is that they're plain noodle dishes were very lacking lackluster and poorly comprised. The Dan Dan noodle was the only one that's halfway decent. The few others were extremely oversalted with no balance. On top of these beautiful light and airy and wonderful noodles they put a clump of some very dense and assertive preparation. My suggestion is that they put together a pork or chicken or any protein with any number of simple seasoning's."}
{"text":"The food was just OK but too overpriced, not to mention the customer service."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles are yummy. The layout is nice and room for larger parties in the back"}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese food and decided to visit this place inside Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino for convenience since we stayed there. The staff was very friendly and we were seated within minutes. Loved the decor and the goldfish tanks. We ordered a few mouth watering items. I always go crazy and sometimes over do it. Everything taste great,  but the downside is that each item is pretty pricey. Then again you are dining inside Caesars, so expect it and use common sense. It's gonna be expensive. Don't complain. If you want cheap go out in town."}
{"text":"This is how I imagine a trendy Chinese restaurant in Helsinki.  White space with massive fish tanks holding hundreds of goldfish (how the hell do they keep the water so clean?) and minimalist touches throughout.  Food however, not so authentic.  The pork buns are better in Beijing (imagine that!); the flat noodle with eggs is tasty, but gooey; and the kung pao chicken is marked as \"spicy\" on the menu but really isn't.  Thai iced tea is gross in my book, but others love it.  

$60 for 2 ppl.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Four stars mainly for the fabulous decor. From the beautiful aquariums filled with goldfish to the intricate white lace design of the wall and ceilings, this is a very impressive looking restaurant.

The food was good. Nothing out-of-this-world but still good.

I only wish the prices were a bit lower."}
{"text":"Ambience and look of the restaurant is awesome with large tanks of gold fishes. I ordered for soup dumplings. It was bad. I didn't like it at all. My hubby order for a vegetable rice. It just had carrots and peas. And was a small plate. Not filling."}
{"text":"Too pricy with poor food quality. Waited 35 mins to receive my simple roasted duck rice. Then the rice was hard and the duck was super salty and not much of meat just the fat layer of skin. We also ordered something else and it was super bad quality. I am a Chinese myself and this was the first worst Chinese food I ever had."}
{"text":"Trust me, I like to be honest with my ratings (generous too) but Beijing Noodle No. 9 just didn't float my boat. And I won't wait to drop the bomb here. Take heed. This restaurant is way too overpriced for your own good. If all you're looking for is an affordable place to grab some food, turn around and head for the foodcourt. My friend and I ended up paying more than $50 for a small order of spicy wonton, small fried rice and beef noodles. Now if that $50 was in Hong Kong currency, I wouldn't complain but for a meal that could've cost me less than $20 at Chinatown, I ended up paying more than double its value. And sure, it tasted authentic. Even the service was authentic in such a way that the waiters didn't even really understand what we wanted so we resorted to explaining our orders in Chinese. 

The whole concept of Chinese & Western decorative fusion looked pretty interesting at first, but that hype quickly faded as we seated ourselves and witnessed the staff's cold shoulders. Midway through our meal, one of the waiters abruptly came over and asked 'Finish?' Before my friend could even reply no, the waiter was gone and we were left staring at each other. I didn't really know how to feel about the fishtanks that lined up the entrance to the restaurant and allow me to drop in a quick recommendation as an alternative. The new Bachannal Buffet is not a far walk from here. Walk over there and get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Las Vegas I learned a few things about customer service and how people are treated so I like to exclude that when rating a restaurant. But yes it is bad here and unless you are at a high end steakhouse/other fine dining on the strip then usually service isn't the best. Some reviews have stated this is expensive, and I agree and disagree. This is expensive for Chinese food but cheap for Caesars Palace. My meal was $17... at Gordon Ramsey Pub you will be getting two deviled eggs for that price and at Nobu you will be getting hot tea for that price. You are paying for location and a unique food option as the other popular/decent Asian restaurants turn into nightclubs halfway through dinner (Tao and Hakkasan) which is just annoying. SIDE NOTE: if you're looking to get into Tao or Hakkasan nightclub you can skip the line by eating there first and they take you up the back way after dinner. Anyway back to the food, it's ok and worth a try if you keep in mind that it's normal to pay $25 for beef and broccoli because you're inside Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile I'm disappointed in my fellow yelpers.  This is one of those cases.  How can you give this place fewer than 3 stars?

Beijing Noodle is a good restaurant with very good (but overpriced) chinese food.  I ate there three times while in Vegas on busienss and not once did I have a bad experience.  Singapore noodles with curry was the perfect mix of curry, vegetables, and sweetness.  Just like I got in Singapore. Though they should say it has shrimp in it on the menu - so folks with allergies like me don't need to send it back.

Next visit I had the beef wontons with handpulled noodles.  Very flavorful broth, tasty wontons, and chewy fresh tasting noodles.  Great dish!

Last visit I just had to order the beijing beef pancake.  I mean, on name alone!  But they were aweseome - remind me of \"chicken in foil\" I used to get back home in Brooklyn chinese restaruants.  Also had the beef in chili oil which was just like your classic spicy szechuan dish and the chicken in clay pot which reminded me of a fried version philipino chicken adobo.

The decor is a bit off for me - I'm not a huge fan of the ultra modern look.  Pretty funny thought that they have to put a sign on the goldfish tank that says \"Not for human consumption.\"  I'd love to hear the genesis of that sign!"}
{"text":"Average. Nothing special here. It's a bit pricey and the serving portions are not worth the asking price. 

We came here with some family and friends, so we had a rather large group. Dishes we ordered, prime sirloin with string beans, beef chow mien, yang chow fried rice, shrimp FR, fried tofu, corn and chicken soup, honey walnut shrimp and a few more that I can't remember. One word to sum the taste, bland. It really was.  

The line was incredibly long and is definitely not worth the wait. There are so many other Chinese/noodles places in Vegas, I suggest you not waste your time here. Two stars."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to eat here.  The place looks amazing, clean and bright.  You watch them make the noodles, but the service and food?  Meh, much much better.
First, they charge you $5 for rice--give me a break.  stinky little dishes and no rice?  Then, the waitress was so scattered and kooky.  Some of the dishes were really good, General Tso, but the veggie plate was strange, tasteless and so expensive.  Avoid this place there is much better in the hotel and around the strip--that include rice."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. Got an order of Chinese onion pancake and a beef wrap. They were pretty good. The onion pancakes could be crispier, but not bad at all, pretty authentic. I felt like I was taking chances here with other reviews, but their wraps were tasty and worth coming back for! Although I have to admit, there is so much food to explore and try in Vegas at all price points, I only came here because I was hungry and needed something right then and there. I lucked out!"}
{"text":"So, as soon as we sat down, the guys next to us told us to run while we still can, and that the food was like Panda Express, only more expensive.

But, we stayed because we had always wanted to try it out. Actually, my boyfriend wanted to try it out, because he loves noodles. I just was super hungry from the drive to Vegas.

Anyways, he ordered the seafood noodle with hand stretched noodles, and I had the pork belly and mushroom sauce with hand stretched noodles. Both dishes were really good, although my sauce was a little bit too salty for me. Easily fixed with a little bit of broth from my boyfriend's dish. I loved eating the noodles overall.

I'm not sure if it's just me though, but I feel like if you are Asian you get better service. There was a white couple sitting next to us who ordered at the same time and was actually there before us. They ordered similar dishes, but for some reason ours came out faster, our water was always filled, and I dunno... our service was just a little bit better. 

This was the most expensive Chinese food I had to date. I'm not sure how I feel about that yet, but at least I don't feel much regret. I just know that I probably won't eat here again anytime soon because I want to try a less salty and less expensive noodle place. 

Maybe I have eaten at too many noodle places in my life, because this place is just okay to me. I don't feel like the price justified the food. You're really paying for the privilege of eating inside Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"Wish I could have Yelp this place before taking my fiance here for a quick dinner. Lured by the giant golden fish tank, I was hopping this place will at least have a decent modern Chinese cuisine that equally match with its contemporary design. WRONG WRONG WRONG, The food is TASTELESS, OVERPRICED even though the service is the only one thing that is acceptable. I had the most Yucky Singapore style noodles and wonton soup in my life. SERIOUSLY, how could you go wrong with wonton noodles? This place seriously needs A NEW CHEF!"}
{"text":"The decor is modern and sleek, not that it matters much for me.  But maybe in Las Vegas it matters a bit more.  A guy is standing near the front doing the Chinese style hand made noodle thing.  It grabbed my attention as I like Chinese noodles.

I got the fish fillet with black bean sauce as suggested by the waiter.  It normally comes with rice but I got it with the hand made noodles.  The noodles were fantastic - exactly as I hoped they would taste.  If you prefer noodles from a box, don't get them.  These are real homemade fresh noodles and taste nothing like something out of a box.

The food came out very fast but I got the fish then the noodles a while later.  In Vegas I would expect the food at the table all at once, but not that big of a deal.

As with many asian restaurants, the servers seemed to dislike their jobs and life in general.  I guess it's all about the food, which was at least average here.  Another down side was the insane prices.  I could get equal or better quality in L.A. for 1/2 the price at one of my local over-priced restaurants.  I understand it is vegas, but I can almost eat at a decent steak restaurant for the same price!  I was over $40 for some noodles and stir fried fish."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed in the noodle soup!!!  They tell you they make the noodles to order fresh but my seafood noodle soup can out in just a couple minutes .. bland broth and starchy noodles... spring rolls had that mushy texture inside caused by freezing them!!!!  DONT LIE TO ME AND SAY ITS MADE TO ORDER.... And To top it off $4.99. For iced fricken Tea... WOW"}
{"text":"There is only 1 good thing about this place. The decoration of the place was very artsy. It made me felt like I was in a fish bowl or something, I felt I was trapped in some sort of container. It was weird, but very interesting at the same time. 

The food was not as good as I thought it was going to be. As you enter the restaurant, you would notice a few chefs working at the bar making fresh noodles or some dim sum. However, after ordering a bowl of braised beef noodle soup, I wasn't able to tell the difference between package noodles and the fresh hand made ones. The soup base was a very plain beef soup, nothing special about it. The braised beef was juicy, (probably from sitting in the soup for so long) but it was flavorless and there were no sauce that accompany my order to improve the taste.

The price was extremely over price, especially for the quality of our food. My noodle soup was a small size and it was about $16. If the food was a lot better and if the waiters pay more attention to us, it would of POSSIBLY been worth the money. 

I also ordered a cocktail, (Shang Hai Wave) it was very delicious, but it was about $12. It had a strong lychee flavor which was delicious and it has a sweet finish.

DON'T EAT HERE.

Reasons why:
- Food was way over priced
- Service was not extraordinary
- Quality of food was deceiving"}
{"text":"Over priced and dreadful Chinese food tucked in to a corner of Ceasar's Palace.  Wish I could have that meal and my money back.

By far the worse experienced I have had in Las Vegas.  I would have complained had there been one person there who seemed remotely interested in my experience.

Run, run, run the other way."}
{"text":"Horrible jiajiangmyun and Singapore noodles- too salty. On the flip side, the food came out very quickly. The Thai iced tea was decent, too. But I wouldn't come here again. (Also, everything was overpriced for the quality that was served.)"}
{"text":"Delicious! It's open 24/7 so you can get your fill any time. The atmosphere is really neat. The bee brisket was amazing and their hand pulled noodles are fantastic! Made fresh daily and you can watch while they make them."}
{"text":"I guess 2.5 star is how Americans thought about the most traditional Chinese noodle (handmade). That's fine- my wife and me tried Lanzhou style beef noodle soup and normal beef noodle soup. I would say that's exactly what it tastes like at China street, amazing."}
{"text":"Nancy, the general manager here is super sweet. Very attentive! When I ate here last time, she kept making sure I was happy with the dishes I chose and my cup was always filled with tea. Wonderful service and management. Did I mention they have the best fried rice? Lol"}
{"text":"Coming with 4 people. Been charged 18% gratuity! Order a dish which doesn't come with any rice and ask 2 steamed rice been charged $3.99/each.... Taste was fine but the attitude and charges....... Bullshyt~ later the cashier coming and say oh I Didt know who charged your gratuity?! Yea who gave me the receipt to sign on then...... I almost signed another 15% based on this receipt.... Luck me~ I took second look."}
{"text":"Looking for a Chinese place to quench your hunger, this is a pretty decent place. A little pricey for Chinese food, but had good food. We order the short ribs, was surprisingly good, could have been more tender so it's not the fall of the bone type tender. But the flavor were really good. We also order the clay pot soup, good flavor as well and then a eggplant and strong bean dish. That was alright. Over all pretty good food, but I would only go if I crave Chinese food and my cousin in law was."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good few years ago. It used to be.

We ordered the beef brisket noodle, fried rice, and the cung pao shrimp with peanuts. The fried rice was not completely  mixed with the sauce. There was still some chunk of white rice. The cungpao shrimp was too salty, and the noodle was not cooked enough.  

Waste of money. No wonder the restaurant is empty at 6:30 dinner time."}
{"text":"Despite of low rate review we still came Here to try the food today. After our experienced,, please don't come to this place at all!!!!!! Bad food,, bad service!!!! Ordered beef brisket noodle soup and sea food noodle soup. 1 soup came after 25 mins and it's just warm instead of hot noodle soup... Waiting for 2nd soup for another 15 more minutes,,, asked the waitress ,,, 2nd soup still not ready. That's 40mins total of waiting for the 2nd soup. Really? Price is crazy expensive for crappy food and bad service!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful...i went with a large group n found the service excellent. The food was delicious...especially the 1000 year old egg..."}
{"text":"So far my experiences at this restaurant have been very good.  I can understand that the decor is a hit or miss situation.  Those fish I tend to focus more on the food though, and this place did very well in my book.   I love their Shiu-Mai and the Salt & Pepper Fried Chicken.  I have also tried a few of the Noodle dishes, braised beef, soya chicken, roast duck and a few of the fried rice dishes ( regular, beef, seafood).  Mostly good dishes, nothing really as pleasing to my palate as the Shiu-Mai and Fried Chicken that I favor.  

Service has been very good mostly.  I still have not had a bad experience with service so far.  Every now and then you get the emotionally closed off server who seems just a little too professional and exhibits little personality, but I find that in most cases a little bit of friendliness on my part goes a long way to fixing that problem.

Portions are a little on the small side.  The one thing I can't get over is that charge for a small bowl of steamed rice. /sadface  But if you're not a big rice eater like me then you should have no problem there."}
{"text":"The only reason you go there is because the buffet line is too long and this place is right next door. Food is astonishingly expensive for subpar quality."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while waiting to get into the Bacchanal Buffet. The hostess took us to a table and said someone would be with us shortly. Weird ceiling and walls. After waiting for 45 minutes, no one had come to our table to take our order. We searched the menu and walls for any instructions that we weren't aware of, but there was nothing to indicate that we were to do anything but wait for someone to come to our table and take our order. We poured over the menu over and over, they seemed to have some exceptional and expensive dishes ($161.00 for some Kobe Beef), but no one came, so after 45 minute of waiting, we left and went to an ice cream place."}
{"text":"This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!

They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.  

The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.  

Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!"}
{"text":"I don't like the ceiling and walls, make me feel so cold like in a ice cube.
food is okay, just okay. 
wait time for hot and sour soup is so long. the soup not even hot enough when i got it."}
{"text":"Portions are a lil small, food is decent. The highlights are the roast duck, soup dumplings, the ribs, the hand made noodles are good but I am not crazy about the Beijing sauce. You can watch them make the noodles in the front. I love the decor and service was fine."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas and stayed at Caesar's Palace. Had seen this restaurant on Food Paradise and wanted to give it a try. Had the Chicken and Mushroom Noodle Bowl. It was excellent! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food with little to no spices. 12$ for 4 steam dumplings that tasted bleh.   Great atmosphere ok customer service but out of three dishes ordered none was good. Total disappointment. The asian food was better at planet hollywoods buffet. Big disappointment. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only 2.5 stars. The food is great and the service is always good, been here many times. Perhaps people are upset with the wait or the fact they don't do same day reservations? Yes it is also very loud and they need to do something about that but the food is delicious and the house made noodles are awesome :)"}
{"text":"This place is quite tasty, good portions and reasonably priced for Vegas! I ordered the beef chow fun and it was quite yummy. I really like the decor and the food came out in about 5 minutes.  If you can't wait for the buffet I would try this place. Lots of Asians eating here so must be good!"}
{"text":"We started with the hot and sour soup. It was okay. Not sure what the rage was. Then we ordered the general Tao chicken the shrimp Chowmein and the chicken fried rice. The general tso chicken was the best out of all of it. It was lightly fried but not overly sauced. The fried rice was bland it actually needed salt. The chowmein was just average. For a noodle place I expected more. It was expensive. They had Brooklyn sorachi ace in a bottle which was totally awesome."}
{"text":"The hostess was a bit off, but my waitress was excellent. A really unique interior - the latticework walls are beautiful as well as the 'not for human consumption' Goldfish tanks.   The dancing Boy-band videos are a wee much when munching away. I came here in the afternoon when the traffic was pretty light. 
The noodles are definitely fresh - I don't know who makes 'em, but dang tasty!!! Ordered their Beijing 9 Won Ton and I liked it - authentic and flavorful. In fact, quite s few people around me ordered the same thing. The Soup Master is awesome here!
I think it's like most restaurants in Vegas - if it's crowded-best bet is to move on. But if the foot traffic is light - definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the money.  I have had much better Chinese food for much less and the service was a huge let down considering it was in the Caesar Palace hotel."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Food extra yummy. Service was incredibly prompt and courteous. The waitress was very helpful in choosing food, and with advice on how to eat it most appropriately.  I had the duck noodle soup which was incredible. My friend had lamb \"pancakes\" which were just amazing."}
{"text":"We were sick of the buffet so tried this place.  Ordered Malan noodle, its hand made noodle from northern China.  Then saw the chef really hand made in the front of store behind the glass. They were really good and authentic!  We were pleasantly surprised.  The price of $16.99 is kind of high for a bowl of beef noodle, but for freshly hand made to order is worth it."}
{"text":"Started off great, then service became non existent.  Food came out at terrible intervals, each person at table was done eating before the next was served.

$20+ for the thinnest strip of chicken breast you can imagine, no sides.  Food was \"ok\" at best, wouldn't recommend at all with hundreds of better choices around.

Atmosphere was perfect, will take more than that to get repeat business though."}
{"text":"This place is OK...not great.  If you're looking for great Chinese food, this is not it.  If you're in a rush and have no great alternatives, it's certainly not bad."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely terrible. My boyfriend and I ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and  Century Egg and Shredded Pork Congee. I could make a better meal at home. Terrible first meal during a Vegas trip. 
1) Beef Brisket Noodle Soup - Brisket could have been cooked longer. The meat had a very tough and chewy consistency. Broth flavor was too light. Noodles were also overcooked.
2) Congee - TERRIBLE. Came out luke warm and not reheated long enough. Porridge base was definitely old and lacked flavor. No salt, no soy sauce, no seasoning whatsoever. Zero taste. They just add the toppings and mix with plain porridge so don't expect anything fancy. Texture of the rice was also off. If you are expecting something comforting, this is not the dish for you.
Absolutely ridiculous for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"I love noodles, all kinds of noodles and have eaten oodles of handmade noodles (in China  too).  Take a pass.  The noodles were okay, but the broth and sauces were bland and lacked flavor.  And for the prices they charge here, you're better off going somewhere else.  I was clearly suckered in by the word \"Beijing\" and the prop noodles in the display case.  Don't be tricked by the random 4 - 5 star review...it's just more props.  

The only plus, the scenery is super pretty and I suspect what you're actually paying for is the pretty goldfish in the tanks."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE hostess, Stopped by for dinner.  It was a pretty busy evening and I was told it'd be around 30min for a table for 1.  Fine, hostess took my cel # and told me I would be msg'd when table ready.  Took a walk around the stores and came back to the restaurant 30min later.  There were plenty of tables for 1-2 people available at this time.  

I stood there by the entrance, no msg on my phone and the same hostess didn't bother to acknowledge my existence.  I waited for 5-10min when I finally asked when my table would be ready. Same hostess that took my number earlier asked me for my number again even though she had already taken my number AND tables were available.  I told her that she had already taken my  number over 30min ago.  She just gave me a blank look then grabbed a menu and took me to one of the many available seats.

Lucky that the food is decent otherwise I'd rate this a one star and never return.  The waiter that I had was friendly and the rest of my meal was uneventful.

If I was the manager, I'd get rid of that hostess.  But maybe in Vegas they get enough one time customers that they don't worry about customer service or satisfaction."}
{"text":"Attentive service, but the food isn't that great. The noodles were good though so if you go here get those. The springrolls were average and the dumplings were a little above average.  Much better restaurants within Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Worse Chinese food I ever had in my life! So pricey for what you eat. All the food had literally no taste. Its funny because those were what waiter recommended. Please go somewhere else. Seriously!"}
{"text":"The food?!  Really bad!  The brisket soup noodle had meat so tough and had more gristle than meat. I sent it back. No kidding i can't remember the last time I sent something back. 

Whatever you do, skip this restaurant!  It really is that bad!!!!!"}
{"text":"If YOU Don't have a SEVEN STARS or a DIAMOND CARD. Expect a Very Long Wait..!! They DO NOT Cater and are NOT Welcoming to People who are trying the Establishment for the First Time. LUCY, who I believe might be the manager (hostess) kept telling us different things. We were a party of 12. One minute we have a Table and next minute, We DON'T..!! Our Tables were taken by a Seven Stars or Diamond Card Holder.. 
THE FOOD WAS NOT WORTH IT..!!!!!
The Wait or the Lies Left a Bad Taste in My Mouth..!! 
I Don't Think I Will Be Coming Back... :("}
{"text":"We stayed at Caesars Palace for 2 nights ( we are locals), so decided to try this place. Since we were relaxing in our room, we ordered fried rice to go. I was shocked my husband brought this, it was small, only 5 shrimps, not much vegetables. And moreover, it was $26 plus tax so over $28 for just one fried rice. It's wayyyyyy over price. Sorry but probably we won't come back! We can go Chinatown or other local Chinese restaurants for more tasty foods."}
{"text":"Came in at 2am for the pork soup and eventually also the beef chow fun. The food was good. Service was okay. And for a 2-item tab almost $60, there was definitely something missing... 
Maybe the high price or the food itself in amount or quality? One thing's for sure; its one of the handful of options for a 2am munchie fix.."}
{"text":"What's not to love? The decor is beautiful, the food is delectable and satisfying, and the service is friendly, prompt, and accommodating. They're willing to customize any dish to suit almost any conceivable palate, carnivore, carbo-phobic, or otherwise. You get what you pay for, and what you get at Beijing Noodle is worth it."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by the number of bad reviews but I went here with my mom, and it was great! Service was very good, always come to check on us, and good was very delicious. We ordered the egg and tomato noodle, raost duck noodle, the onion pancakes, and Shanghai Xiaolongbao. Food was a bit pricey but hey its inside Cesaer Palace. My mom and I had a great meal here! filled our stomaches up really well!"}
{"text":"Awful food.  Shared mongolian beef with wife.
Cheapest cut of meat I have ever had.  Chewed like a rubber tire.  For $24 they really failed miserably and then added insult to injury with a portion of rice that was in a mini bowl the size of a cup.  Shame shame to the tightwad owners"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent Vegas visitor since I was 24. I consider Caesar's my home away from home. I love the smell (I know -- kinda twisted and weird) and most everything about it. 

Considering how many times I have stayed at Caesar's, it's a surprise that I had never eaten at Beijing Noodle before. My friend and I were in Vegas two weeks ago to run the Rock N Roll 1/2 Marathon and decided to continue our carb loading by eating here a few hours before the run. In hindsight it was a pretty stupid idea... 

I ordered the combination chow mein and my friend Kim ordered the beef chow fun. The food: very greasy, bland (we had to ask for chili oil for flavor) and not very authentic Chinese. I was debating between the chow mein and the noodle soup (which, by looking at the other diners' bowls, looked more authentic and probably what I SHOULD have eaten before a run) and regretted my decision immediately. 

I presume the reason the place stays busy is because a lot of the Asian gamblers are hesitant to try the other cuisines offered in the casino (that or don't want to wait in line for Bacchanal Buffet). I only hope the noodle soup tastes a lot better than what we ordered...

The menu was decently large though. They even have soup dumplings (xlb) but they are like $12 an order... No thanks. I doubt I'll ever come back to eat here...unless I had no other option... 

On the way out, a noodle maker was pulling and stretching out housemade noodles!! Whyyyyy did I not order something fresh and instead got the processed noodles? Cry.... 2 stars for the food, an extra for the atmosphere (fish tanks)....though they could probably do without the plastic chairs."}
{"text":"Shanghai Soup Dumplings with Pork ($15): I've eaten Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings in China).   The dumplings here are not the same. First, they stick to the small metal tins and causes the dumplings got pierce and release the soup.  Second( the soup is bland.  However, it's a good attempt, and if you haven't had the real thing, these dumplings are a good appetizer (6 dumplings for $15).

Seated Scallops with Asparagus ($27).   A generous portion of scallops and asparagus. The seasoning is light, but would satisfy most palates. 

Drink: Large hot Sake ($15).   More pricey than other places, but the Sake is smooth without any aftertaste.  

Service: Excellent. 

Ambiance: The Restaurant is open, so it invites a lot of ambient noise.  It can be a little overwhelming, but this is not an intimate place. 

Decor: Stark white patterns with mosaic design is unique.  Goldfish is acrylic tanks line the entryway.  

Overall: The meal was okay, but lower prices would make the experience better. I've eaten better Chinese offerings, but this place is open 24 hours.  A definite plus when you're staying at Caesars Palace and crave something better than a sandwich."}
{"text":"Overpriced!!!
Bad service!!!
The MOST important thing is the food taste REALLY BAD!!!"}
{"text":"The environment is uniquely beautiful. I just feel relaxed when I am in there. I love the noodle soup there, but the rest is off my list. It's fresh and light!!!! Unfortunately, I could not take a picture of the noodle soup because I was so hungry at that time after a-few-hour-waiting. 
I will definitely go there again for the noodle, but the rest ... Ehhhh ??"}
{"text":"Although visually appealing, the goldfish tanks they have are cruel.  There was nothing in it but packs of goldfish - no rocks or plants or anything.

I had zha jiang mian and the xiao long baos, and they were both okay but not amazing.  Overall they were a little bit bland, and I've definitely had much better.  But at the same time they did kind of satisfy my craving when I was wanting zha jiang mian at the time!"}
{"text":"From the outside, the restaurant looked cool but once I walked through several large fish tanks full of gold fishes and into the white dining area, it felt like I just stepped into an insane asylum. Maybe I was insane for trying such a pretentious restaurant that I know will serve average food I can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. Oh well, it was too late to turn back and we wanted something light before hitting the road. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised. 

Nope, as expected the food was average. We ordered braised beef brisket ($16.00) with handmade noodle and steamed pork buns ($9.00). 

Braised beef noodle - The soup was actually good but the noodle was average. With the word \"noodle\" in the name of the restaurant, the noodle was a big disappointment. Also, the beef had a wet towel smell to it. 

Steam pork bun - a disappointment as well. The texture of the bun was not firm and was a bit mushy and the pork had no flavor. At $9 for 3 little buns, we were expecting more. 

Service was good if this was a hole in the wall joint but when you are charging $16 for noodle soup, the service needs to be stepped up a notch or two. 

Everything about this restaurant is pretentious even for LV standards, from the ridiculous gold fish tanks, to the cold decor to the hostess in miniskirt (not complaining here). Noodle is comfort food so it would be nice if the restaurant could have a warmer feel to it. 

Recommendation: Don't come here for the food but if you like to look at gold fish, this is the place for you. Also, if you like all white decor, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Eh, it was fine. Average at best. I didn't think it was notably better than your average Chinese takeout place. It was less greasy though. But for the price of $15-30 dishes, you could do better."}
{"text":"Look, you go to Vegas, you have to expend a premium on pricing.  I was a bit appalled to see that my $9 bowl of cabbage and beef cubes in broth was so small, but found it really quite good.

It wasn't terrible, it just seems overpriced is all."}
{"text":"High prices don't match average tasting dishes.  Service was adequate but food came at staggered intervals.  Best dish was perhaps the Chicken Curry, which tasted much like the curry my mom makes."}
{"text":"Gross! You'd think a place that looks as fancy as this one would serve it up a notch. But, nooo! Their noodles are nothing special. So what if they're hand made right on the spot? It's part of the show. And it's part of that huge bill you'll be paying afterwards.   

Their dumplings were dry and their meats were rubbery, like meats served in airplane meals or hospital meals. Panda Express serves even better meats. What a shame. Lesson learned.  You don't have to spend a fortune to enjoy dim sum and noodles. I'll stick to my Chinatown favorites, thank you."}
{"text":"This place offers hand pulled noodles. It's quite a show, a guy behind the front counter stretches, twirls, twists, and bangs the dough to prepare your dish. Too, too fun! Besides that, it's got unique and lovely decor, very light, bright. It was clean, open kitchens. The service was good, I had lots of questions, and our server (Daniel?) was very patient and gave great input. I had a Lychee-tini, very refreshing and not too sweet. We had BBQ steamed buns as an appetizer, and they were nicely done, fluffy and a little bit sweet. Hubby chose chicken chow mein, and liked it a lot. Good portion sizes. I had hand pulled noodles (my food was the show getting tossed around up front) with chicken and mushrooms-sauce on the bottom, quite tasty. Lots of refills as needed on the water. I would dine there again (next trip to Vegas?), and seriously thought about asking my fave local Chinese restaurant if they'd consider adding hand pulled noodles to their menu. I think it would be a hit!"}
{"text":"Mehhhhh....

My dad wanted to come here because he saw the hand pulled noodles.  I must say I was excited initially because I feel like hand pulled noodles are kind of being forgotten and seldom used by restaurants.

I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.

My parents both got the seafood noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  I got the Zha Jiang Mein noodles with hand pulled noodles as well.  So I'll start with the semi positive, the broth was nice, clean, tasty.  Oh and the vegetables in my noodles were tasty too.  
Now the bad, the huge shrimps and scallops were nice to see, but they were overcooked, a bit rubbery.  I mean they weren't super overcooked, but a bit over.  And paying what, like $16 bucks for it, the seafood better be cooked well, dang it! The Zha Jiang Mein noodles were SUPER SALTY, gah, I could barely eat it so I took a bit of the seafood broth in the noodles. Ahh, much better.

It is WAY too expensive, WAY too expensive, but then again, it is Vegas.  But I just feel like Asian food should between $5-15  ($15 is on the expensive side and I'm NOT talking about Panda Express) Sighh...I was just disappointed, verryy disappointed.

I don't recommend you come here, don't LET the hand pulled noodles DRAW you in, IT'S A TRAP!"}
{"text":"We came to Beijing Noodle No.9 on a recommendation from friends. We queued from around 20 minutes before we were seated and then served fairly quickly. The restaurant has a very bright arty white theme going on so it is not a place to visit with a headache. 

The food was very good albeit slightly overpriced ($18 for a chow mein) but I would happily recommend it to anyone seeking good Asian food in Caesar's Palace."}
{"text":"Our rooms came with a free $20 food credit everyday. So one night, I decided to order to go from here. 

We ordered a beef chow fun (so thick noodles). It came in a rather small container, with enough oil to fry french fries, but it was still tasty. I probably wouldn't get it at normal price (it literally was $23 including tax/tip for the single entree). I couldn't eat much due to the amount of oil in the dish."}
{"text":"A negative experience was that we came by and the restaurant was 50% full, so the hostess tells us that is a 25 minute wait until I complained and she accepted to give us the table... happened to two other white couples, because we are not Asian... we felt like racist and this is a free country, must fix that ASAP. 
As a noodle lover I really recommend this restaurant, their variety of noodles is great and their beef brisket is awesome."}
{"text":"This noodle house gets 4 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food.  The noodles are freshly made at the restaurant by a chef from China.  We especially liked the Dan Dan noodles which were mouth watering and mouth numbing at the same time.  They also serve a great won ton soup with mini won tons, however I wish it was all won tons instead of a combo of won tons and noodles.  The duck fried rice was another house special which was also very good, although it was way too pricey.  Two things brought the rating down from 5 stars.  This place is not big and we wait 35 minutes to get a table for 4 and another 25 minutes to get any food served.  We got there around 11:30.  The hostesses were nice and friendly but often left the front unattended walking back and forth into the restaurant or kitchen for some reason.  The waitress however were not that friendly, and the kitchen seems too small for the amount of seats in the restaurant.  This was evident by the slow arrival of our food and the waitress stating they would not be able to serve a dessert dumpling dish listed on the menu because the kitchen was too busy cooking regular lunch dishes to make any dessert dish.  So why even have it on the menu? Also although all of the back counter seats were empty our order still took 25 minutes for any food to hit the table. When we asked the waitress she said she was holding or main dishes until the appetizer (juicy buns) were prepared and served first.  After we told her we would be happy any food she brought out the other dishes first.  During the wait for our food we tried to get the attention of the manager but he was preoccupied filling what looked like a number of large take out or special orders so he pretty much ignored the in house customers and avoid any contact with them.  So 5 stars for food, 2 stars for service.  Overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, we are here for lunch and first the service was so slow. It took over an hr to get our entrees and then had to rush to eat. The chicken dish was disgusting, the chicken I questioned to be chicken it was so rubbery. I actually didn't even eat it.. Only the rice. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Avoid the buffet madness at Caesar's Palace and have some noodles instead. Seriously, check out the long line (with security) at Bacchanal and, if you're anything like me, you'll run the other way! Luckily, Beijing Noodle is right around the corner, tucked away from the all-you-can-eat crowd.

Rather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork. 

Two of us split a duo of dishes, the Tomato and Egg Sauce noodles alongside Sautéed Eggplant with Sichuan Garlic Sauce. We *almost* had the Green Onion Pancake, but didn't want to overdo it. This was lunch and we didn't want a gut-busting meal! Would never have though to put fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce with egg on fresh noodles, but somehow it worked! And normally I don't seek out vegetarian dishes at restaurants, but eggplant is one of those foods I have yet to master at home. It was cooked perfectly and had plenty of sauce on top. 

As many have already indicated, the decor is quite interesting. Glad that we sat off to the side since the whole experience is a bit off kilter. This is coming from someone who gets nauseous at the though of a roller coaster or takeoff in an airplane, so take that note with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"It's stupendous for all day dim sum, noodles, and so much more! Manager Chris was very accommodating.  I often dine alone and prefer to sit at a bar when available. Unfortunately, the bar server had gone home so the bar was closed but the manager made an exception for me and gave me 1st choice.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place seems to get mediocre ratings for the $$$, but we thought it was really good regardless...i guess i'm in Vegas not to penny pinch, otherwise we'd go eat off the strip.  

The hand pulled noodles were perfect, in a soy based sauce with pork and vegetables.  Soup dumplings, fun challenge to eat and drink at the same time, very good.  Green onion cakes make a good starter, crispy green beans and eggplant yummy.  We also had the pork ribs, in a really good sauce, fall off the bone tender.  For us, it all added up to cleaned plates and satisfying lunch.  Definitely go back if wanting Chinese and in or nearby Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Today's service by Carol W was stellar.  The  soda machine was down and she offered to go to the bar, twice and she checked on us to ensure everything was good. She was sweet, nice and extremely efficient. Aside from the amazing food I'd come back because of Carol."}
{"text":"The menu items try to come across more authentic, but the food did not actually taste that way and prepared by Asians!.  It is Vegas and in a hotel, but it's hard to pay this much for the kind of dishes on the menu.  Noodle soups and even the salt & pepper squid didn't quite have the full flavors they should and felt \"Americanized\"."}
{"text":"the only cool part of this place is the gold fish tanks and the interior of the restaurant. the decor is the only reason this place gets stars.. 

the food: gross... i mean seriously. they make only one type of noodle here and there is no way to have it any other way then the way it is on the menu. the portions are pretty small, so if you like noodles its going to suck for you, I love noodles and it was quite sad for me. the hainan chicken rice was decent. the dim sum shrimp \"har gow\" was good and very shrimpy. but for 9 bucks you better hope so.  the soy milk was okay a little bland, the watermelon juice was good. o the vietnamese coffee, dont get it. its not good at all... 

overall the noodles are good. i just wish it was flavored better. the tomato based sauce noodles was good and the mushroom one was kinda too grocery store frozen food for my taste. o yea.. the dumplings both fried and steamed sucked so do without those. 

haha.. good thing i didnt pay for anything. LOL i would have been annoyed even more."}
{"text":"Decor: Amazing decor. Modern and great lighting.

How it relates to Chinese food? Not sure. But I like how it doesn't go for \"Orientalism\" design that establishments can easily fall into. That's why I gave it a second star.

Food: If it wasn't for the Interior Decoration, this place would have gotten a 1-Star.

We ordered Jelly Fish, Yang Chow Fried Rice, Salt & Peppered Shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles, and Hot Tea.

1) Portions were small. I'm not sure if it's because they consider themselves a Gourmet Restaurant, if that's the case, then I should deduct points for presentation. 

Presentation? There is none... it's just served on a plate like a regular Chinese Restaurant.

2) Taste. None to Bland. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I only enjoyed the Salt & Peppered Shrimp. It was crispy, not too greasy, not really spicy.

3) Service was bad. Servers are as attentive and personable as a regular Chinese Restaurant. Which I don't mind, when I'm eating at family owned Chinese Restaurants. But I expect better service when I'm ordering plates that are $16 - $20 at the lowest.

- The Host was a young woman who didn't smile or didn't make us welcome... That's your job as a host!!! 

4) Price. Crazy!
I don't understand how they justify charging people for this place. The Thai Iced Tea is $6.99..... Yup, you read that right. 

I would seriously question the pallet of any person that gave this place more than 3 stars. My advice, just go to Chinatown and find yourself a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"All the people who left the place disappointed, honestly what do you expect from a noodle restaurant inside a hotel on the Strip? You're obviously in for some overpriced, bland noodles. Not the SGV cheap/ goodness. Going in with this mindset, I was actually surprised to find the food pretty decent. At least you know the noodes are handmade. The servings were definitely small though.

What gives this place its wow factor is the deco. The huge fish tanks that take up the length of the entire restaurant filled with swarming goldfishes as well as walls and ceilings carved out in a pattern reminiscent of the activity inside these tanks made for quite a spectacle. That's what this whole place is about - the show, fitting for Vegas dontcha think? 

The waiter was super nice and serviceable. When I asked him to take a picture of us he kept on directing us where to stand and how to pose and clearly was having fun doing it. Loved that. In the end, got a pretty cool picture of us standing behind the aquarium with fishes all around."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. The decor was pretty cool, although I thought there were too many fish in the aquarium (on one of the press clippings outside the restaurant it said you could choose your own fish to eat - I hope they weren't talking about these cute little gold fish). As for the food we shared a small bowl of noodles with pork and mushrooms ($15), steamed pork buns ($10) and Vietnamese iced coffee ($6). The noodles were I guess hand made and actually quite tasty, but there was barely anything else in the bowl....just some sweet sauce, 2-3 slices of mushroom and 2-3 pieces of shredded pork/dried bacon. The buns were average - edible but nothing special. The coffee was good. The most exciting part of the meal was the fire...so midway through our lunch fire alarm went off. At first we thought it was just a test so we did not pay much attention to it and neither did anyone else (we experienced fire alarm test at Harrah's the day before). But then we heard overhead announcement saying \"please evacuate the building\" so we asked the waitress what was going on and she said \"don't worry, this happens all the time\". What, they have daily evacuations!? I don't think she understood the announcement so we asked her to please go outside and check it out (we were somewhat concerned, but apparently not so motivated to check it out ourselves). She came back reporting that everything was ok, but that we were free to leave if we wanted. No one else budged from their seats and so comforted by the crowd mentality we stayed. A few minutes later there was another announcement saying that fire had been contained and to return to our normal activity. So much for fire alarms."}
{"text":"Dinner was served family style. We all enjoyed ourselves. I had some of their green tea and it was amazingly good. We had some crabs with a ginger garlic sauce that had me smiling from its great taste. The beef and asparagus was well cooked and seasoned and I'm not one known for eating asparagus. Lol. The scallion pancakes was so good, I could have just eaten that. The table loves the dinner and then it was off to the club."}
{"text":"Wow. I have no clue what most of these reviewers are griping about. We had an amazing time and dinner. Clearly a Tuesday  night in January isn't likely to have a wait so we were seated immediately. I was worried that the white room would feel too bright and cold to me (I'm weird like that) but it was really lovely. Immediate service by our first waiter..Chung. .friendly quick and knew the menu inside out. We had never been to a Chinese noodle restaurant  and we're pretty clueless. He explained every noodle  style to us and seemed  pretty excited about them all. The pork pancake wrap was amazing. Brisket soup noodles was also a big hit. Second waiter Eric took over seamlessly. Great martinis as well. One dish came out with a different noodle than expected and he whisked it away to be changed. All in all an amazing visit. I'm going back for sure"}
{"text":"It seems like this place gets a bad rap, and perhaps it is for the right reasons, but I can only speak to an amazing noodle bowl I had while I was there.  It had some sort of round noodle, egg and tomato, with some light herbs and spices and a light sauce.  I was amazing.  If this place has take out I might go back there just for another bowl of that amazingness.  It's kinda tucked away in Caesar's, and the prices are a little high for what you get.  The service was rather slow and not very courteous.  I'll have to hit up this place again for a follow-up review."}
{"text":"If you know anything about Chinese food, DON'T EAT HERE. 

Actually, if you know anything about food, DON'T EAT HERE. 

We were walking around Caesars Palace completely lost (That place is a maze I swear!! That's how they trap you so you will gamble endlessly since there's no way out!).. anyways, walking around, starving.. my stomach was digesting itself..

suddenly.. i see FISH.. lots and lots of them..  ohhhh pretty fish tank, let's eat here! 

Sat down.. kinda dig the decor, very avant garde, I like it!

when I got my food, I immediately regret being lured in by goldfish... 

We ordered the seafood dumplings and some kind of chow fun soup noodle. My dumplings were the worst dumplings I ever had. I'll admit, I am a dumpling snob. Growing up we made dumplings every sunday. It's in my blood I can make it with my eyes closed. But these are just really, really bad, almost inedible food! The meat filling was mushy and disgusting.. the skin was thick and undercooked and overcooked at the same time. (still uncooked inside but the outside was mush). Noodles were bland and boring.. 

PLEASE don't eat here.. I don't want anyone else to endure the same pain I did.. 

Chinatown is only about 10 minutes car ride away, the restaurant upstairs has good dumpling! Or.. if anything.. go to Panda Express... 

pure bad food :\"}
{"text":"How do you mess up fried rice? It was cold. The portion was small for the price. Why are they still open? Good Chinese food is not hard. If you're going to charge that much money, at least try."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Beijing Noodle No. 9. I bordered on a 2 or 3 rating but stuck with the 3. We were greeted and sat near the Kitchen where we could see the staff hard at work. We waited about 10 minutes to get someone to recognize that we were actual customers who just got seated. Ten Minutes already in negative status. Finally got our drink order and an appetizer ordered. Steamed BBQ pork Buns. Bland and sticky. Not what i have ever experienced in past Noodle houses. We then ordered Shrimp fried rice Hand pulled soup noodle with Chicken. The decor here is all white almost 3D in its appearance to the eye. Floors were very dirty and ambiance was very loud. As we waited for our food a large table was sat order taken in a language I did not speak and not soon after and before our food arrived they were receiving dishes. Thought that to be odd. Our food finally arrived. I can't speak to the goodness of the food as it was bland. We were going to a show so it seemed like an easy stop on the way. Too many good or excellent noodle shops in this town to put this even on a list. 
Thank you for dining at Beijing Noodle No. 9. I can't say I will go here again. They will not miss my business. Not sure they really even wanted it to begin with. If you are a tourist in Caesars and are looking for an almost quick bite before a show at a reasonable price I guess you could try it. But if you are a local, I can suggest dozens more noodle shops worth the visit."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would have preferred Ramen noodles.  My wife and I were intrigued by the hand twisted noodles, but as far as taste goes there was nothing special.  Food was plain and boring.  I had been meaning to go to this place every time I was in Vegas because I love the restaurants in Caesar's.  Needless to say I was highly disappointed by this one.  Service was ok, but they took forever to bring us our rice, which we ended up canceling because of the noodles.  Great concept, poor result."}
{"text":"Out of the week that we were in Las Vegas, this was by a landslide the WORST restaurant we went to. After a night at Omnia, we decided to head back to the room early and stumbled upon Beijing Noodle which was still open! We thought, after a night out what a Win that we would be able to enjoy some Chinese cuisine. Going online to find the menu, I seem to not be able to find it as the selection of choices that I was given is not what is listed as the \"overnight menu\" which looks much better than our choices. I ordered a beef noodle dish and a side of pork buns. The pork buns were decent, barely filled with pork. If I'm being honest, the frozen pork buns I buy from Trader Joes are significantly better than these. 

The beef noodle dish, looked and tasted horrible. It was honestly like eating a pile of mushy grease. I took a few bites and couldn't eat more. It made me so sick the next day, I could not recommend this place to anyone! The worst part was just for those two dishes, I ended up spending around $60. Worst money I have ever spent..."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! I don't make a trip to LV without going! Great ambiance...it's not cheap, but I've even been with people who don't like chinese food and like it. (Those people should get salt&pepper chicken or shrimp...I think it's called...fantastic) It's amazing! Must try! --Kansas City Foodie"}
{"text":"From the moment I saw this place I knew I wanted to try it. I'm a big fan of noodles so I needed to try it out. This place was nicely decorated with fish tanks and an elaborate wall design. It looked clean and modern. But, the wait time was unbearable. If I knew I'd be waiting almost an hour to get seated I would have made reservations. But other than that, the food was good. Nothing really spectacular about the flavors. We ordered the spicy chicken cubes, honey BBQ pork bejing pancake wrap with cilantro and chicken and mushroom with hand pull noodle. Everything we tried had standard Chinese sauces except for the pancake wrap. The honey BBQ pork bejing pancake wrap was my favorite of the bunch. It had nice a nice mix of flavors with the sweetness of the BBQ pork with the herby freshness from the cilantro."}
{"text":"The beef brisket soup noodles were very good, I could tell the noodles were fresh. The pork soup dumplings were excellent as well. Open 24/7, so a great late night option."}
{"text":"HOLY cow...Was in Vegas for a conference. I had 2 meals there in one day & then went back twice in 2 days. Dim sum is pretty good. Stir fried Lobster is pretty yummy. My FAV thing on the menu is the XO Hand pull Noodle. Being part Asian, this stuff is done perfectly. 
Nothing is to 'Americanized'
Wish they had one in the Bay area."}
{"text":"This is the WORST RESTAURANT IN VEGAS.  Stay away from this place.  Do not get lured in by the overcrowded fish tanks and hand tossed noodles.  Open the menu first and you will be in for sticker shock.  Chinese noodles for $20 bucks?  \"Kobe\" (notice the quotation marks)  Beef Noodles for $99?!   This place is one sick joke after another.

WARNING:  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!  It's not as upscale as you might think.  It's a tourist trap... I mean it!

We are seated by a deceptively hot waitress only to be served by an extremely mean spirited chinese lady who ... CANNOT SPEAK ENGLISH?!  I politely ask her to get someone that can take our order.  She keeps talking in Mandarin hammering it over and over and over and over my poor little brain.  The constant yapping in a foreign language... maybe she thought i would get it?!

If your selling an upscale product to affluent customers, at LEAST speak in a polite manner and don't toss the menu's at your patrons.  SERIOUSLY
I get that service in Chinatown all the time but not at a $20 a pop wannabe-upscale-noodle place

So after the nightmare, we try the noodles.  To my surprise ... it TOTALLY SUCKS.  I've been to Hong Kong and Shanghai and trust me they are ripping you off BIG TIME!

Did I mention this is THE WORST RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS???"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise as a late night option after coming in from a night of gambling.

*** Food was super fresh and real hot.
*** Can be ordered though the room, although we got it To Go on our way back in from the casinos.
*** Ordered the 'chicken cube' which has the mildly numbing peppercorns. Was very good although wished they would have given us extra sauce on the side since we ordered To Go and didn't want to walk back down to the restaurant. 
*** Shrimp pancakes were good too. 
*** They gave us a LOT of rice.

Would go back for sure. Loved having this as an option for room service late night and not just the typical stuff they normally have on the room service menu."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer: I absolutely hate leaving a bad review but this one deserved it...we've dined here once before.

Food (& ratings):
- Beef chow fun (2):  I'm giving this dish a 2 though the previous year's experience merited a 4.5.  The beef dish is the only one I am rating b/c it is the only one that all other facets of this bad dining experience stemmed from.   

We were about 1/3 through this dish when I noticed that several slices of the beef was RED amidst the noodles.  Ok I enjoy my steak medium rare but not when it comes to something that is supposed to be a stir-fried dish!  Asked waiter, Jimmy (who had an EH attitude all night) to take a look.  Without one word (no apologies on behalf of restaurant) he walked away with dish.  

Ten minutes later, he dropped a new dish somewhat resembling beef chow fun onto the table:  beef was in fact cooked but the noodles blended together in a soggy mess.  Most noodles were still stuck together.  Disaster.  

Worst part of night?  Besides the terrible attitude, Jimmy charged an EXTRA dish that was not ordered.   Had to send the bill back also.  Inept AND careless?  Oh my, what a horrible dinner.

When:
- Christmas 2011

Crowd:
- Any within Caesar's hungry enough to venture forth

Interiors & Service:
- Interiors (4.5): always liked it - double layered walls & ceiling designed in such a way as to instill underwater feel.  Full goldfish tanks link the entry.
- Service (0):  yes, a zero.  Jimmy was terrible, terrible, terrible.  

Overall:
- Not ever going back"}
{"text":"The guy who makes hand pulled noodles lacks some serious techniques. His pulls were not strong enough. Flimsy grips. Slow swings. It made the noodles too soft.

Would have given this place 1 star for the overpriced noodle but the interior decoration was lovely and the hostess was very nice which earns them a second star."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, and I can say that the food is great, but the service is consistently lacking. If you don't mind waiting for your food or having plates/drinks forgotten, then this is the place... but I don't mean to make it sound horrible because the food is actually very, very good. I recommend the Singapore noodles, dim sum dishes, and shrimp fried rice. 

If not for the service, this place is a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food just OK, which was surprising since it got rave reviews in the Denver Post.  Should have checked Yelp.  My mistake.

Well, the decor was VERY cool, but it went downhill from there.

There seemed to be a serious communication problem with the waitress.  She told use the portions were very small and that we need to order more.  So, we ordered the amount she recommended for the four of us.  Well, we got enough food for 6-8 people, which is silly since we were obviously tourists and couldn't take the leftovers with us.

Also, I explained that my wife was a vegetarian.  But, we only got one true vegi dish.  Everything else had pork in it, which meant my wife couldn't eat it, which meant there was even more leftover food.  And, those other pork were greasy and just ok.

If you're in Caesars Palace, see the cool decor here and then eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fresh, handmade noodles served in a very ritzy atmosphere that charges a fortune. The fambam and I came here for dinner just before my return flight to the Bay Area. The decor of the restaurant was very white, and there are A LOT of goldfishes in about six fish tanks standing guard in front of the restaurant.

I ordered a Beijing Style Noodle w/ beef and mushroom in special sauce. It was fifteen bucks for a small single serving of noodles. It would fill up an average person just fine, but my 6\"2' stature was unsatisfied with how little I ate and I devoured copious amounts of chocolate chip cookies at the airport.

Our server Kwok was kind and prompt with our requests. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good recommendations. Some of the staff however was flat out rude and incompetent. They'd simply set down the dish or cups with a loud clatter and grumpily stalk away. 

Nonetheless the small serving of Beijing noodles I got to eat were delicious. Because the restaurant is located inside the Caeser's Palace it must have been absolutely necessary for the prices to go through the roof, but save your money and go else where. If you have a car, drive up Spring Mountain for some good pho houses. There's a couple of Korean BBQ and tofu restaurants that will give you a rich dining experience. You can contribute the money you save for the blackjack tables back at the casinos."}
{"text":"$14 for a glass of wine and $20 for walnut shrimp covered in sugar sauce.  I hope this place gets new managent soon.  I know it is Vegas, but really, please prepare the dish as it is described on the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the potstickers. They were doughy & uncooked on one side. Sent them back explaining how they were underdone. Was asked if we wanted them refried & as an afterthought if we wanted a new order. My bad, I said cook again. Still doughy and extremely greasy. And needed salt. 2 other dishes were okay (shrimp & cabbage dumpling & cold shredded chicken w/house dressing - watch out for tiny bones).   Perhaps noodle dishes would be better."}
{"text":"Needed a bite to eat before the night of drinking officially began lol. We were seated pretty quickly and immediately helped. They gave us these yummy yet salty little bowl of peanuts. I ordered chicken chow mein and my friend ordered kung pao chicken. She liked hers. I liked mine without the chicken. It just tasted off. Everything they had there looks so good though so I can't wait to go back and try more! They are a bit pricey if you order an entree on it's own but they have a special for $30 that has soup, an entree, dessert, and an appetizer. I'd recommend that because it just seems like more bang for your buck. The atmosphere was very modern. Everything was white."}
{"text":"really bad food?i am a chinese?i can tell you THIS IS NOT CHINESE NOODLE, food is disgusting and servoce impatient."}
{"text":"Food is good, they make food on order, the best item I liked was the chicken chow mein, tired beef noodle soup, didn't care of that dish too much. Super fast service and friendly waiters."}
{"text":"For what you pay, the value isn't there: better to eat elsewhere.  The service is spotty (may forget about you for a while), the menus are a bit tattered, the place could be cleaner, and the food is not remotely on par with the price, although not bad.  I don't really recommend the seafood chow menu, but the tea seems decent (at lest not flat or bad).  Main perk is that it's open 24/7 and that the service is not terrible. Also, they're unable to split the bill between a hotel bill credit for food and any amount you might want to charge to credit (rather than room)."}
{"text":"Anyone who rated this joint anything less than 4 stars is a lying liar... or probably a pretentious non-Chinese person pretending to understand Asian food. Handmade noodles, legit dumplings and tasty side dishes. Best Asian food on the Strip, and best of all, open 24/7 for all you degenerate alcoholics leaving the club looking for a hangover cure. Get the beef noodle soup and pickled wood ear mushrooms."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  I was enticed by hand-pulled noodles.  In fact, walking by, you will usually see someone actually cutting and pulling noodles and a small crowd forming to observe.  Once you order, they take the fresh noodles and cook then for you.  But here's the downside: the price!  Because they are located in Caesar's Palace, this place is incredibly expensive.  On my own I probably wouldn't have eaten here, (thank you work for my meal per diem.)  The noodles were ok and the dish I ordered came with some beef (which was rubbery and bland) in some broth.  The noodles themselves ended up being kind of bland, since the overall dish didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered some pork buns which were really good.  They took a while to come out because they are steamed fresh when you order them.  I'll say though for hand pulled noodles, you can probably do better off the strip in Vegas in a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  But if you've got some extra cash and looking to try something  different, check out this place.  Their goldfish tank is way cool - but note the signs that say the fish aren't for human consumption."}
{"text":"My sister and I LOVED this place! We came back twice during our 5 day stay. A friend that was recently in Vegas posted about it, so we tried it out. Yes the giant tanks of goldfish are amazing. I took *so* many photographs. Beautiful.
We ordered the red bean puffs and loved them. The spring rolls were also good. Both times I ordered the crispy tofu and loved it. My sister ordered scallops both times, too. :)
Service was a bit slow during our 2nd visit, but as soon as we alerted a server that we wanted the check, they brought it over quickly."}
{"text":"I went for the price fix lunch which was $30 and the pork was too dry and inedible. The potstickers were also a mess... inedible. 
The rice was excellent but it was a tiny portion.
The hot and sour soup was typical nothing special.
Atmosphere is clean and is incredible.
If only they changed their menu to accommodate that would be the smartest move they could make. 
The Duck noodle dish looked great.

I hope to return in an effort to improve this rating. 

Currently I feel it's overpriced and under delivered.

The staff are amazing.... The food just lacks passion."}
{"text":"We searched for this place for hours and unfortunately it wasn't worth the search. We waited 20 minutes and were seated in the middle of an intensely bright white room. The television was on a novela with no sound, I'm sure it was earlier on a World Cup game but still weird. We ordered pot stickers, mushu pork, and chicken fried rice. Pot stickers took forever, we were warned about that but still. They were ok, nothing special or great. Mushu pork and rice was gross, I only ate it because I was starving. The meat was just blah. I'm ok with different, which is was from Chinese food I've ate before, but this didn't even taste good at all. The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. Don't waste time going here."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I had to write.  Eating at this restaurant was an amazing experience!  We were staying at the Wynn, but actually came back a second day for the noodles!  Our servers were wonderful... Jimmy and Kay.  They definately added to the experience.  They also recommended dishes.  When I asked about some of the dishes, they directed me away from those that they didn't think we'd appreciate.  The hand made noodles were WONDERFUL!!! Was it pricey? Yes a little, but again it's Vegas!  $40 for lunch isn't terrible."}
{"text":"I did not have the opportunity to try the food and thank God! When we requested to have a untaken table, full of left over food and dirty dishes, we do not mind waiting, the Chinese hostess told us to wait outside and she cannot be bothered to get someone to clear that table! By the sight of tables full of left over food and dirty dishes really turn me off. If there's a half star, this place definitely deserved it!"}
{"text":"Come here because you're stone, drunk or both....come here for the novetly and not for the taste; and if you're like me, dont come here to watch communist parade videos NOT COOL....and as an american business in LAS VEGAS one would think you can show some appropriate videos that reflect the opportunity that was given to you to conduct business in the USA. Otherwise, just another over priced restaurant with very little thought for taste and to showcase originality. The upside, open late, pretty skinny Chinese Hostess, nice gold fish tanks....other than that, 1 star."}
{"text":"Best pulled noodles ever! that was sooo delicious - texture, consistency and cooked just right.  The fried rick was also fantastic - surprisingly (I mean, I am after all Asian and I always go to chinese restaurants and have had a multitude of variety of fried rice).  We also had the pork belly with the clear noodles - the meat was tender and the sauce was simple and understated but complemented the dish very well.  The pancakes were also tasty.  Staff was friendly and accommodating. Would come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before coming here. Not only was the food overpriced (which was expected), the food was actually pretty much inedible. We got the standard chow mein and the zha jian noodle (black bean sauce noodle). The chow mein tasted like Panda Express chow mein: oily, salty, and probably loaded with MSG. But the zha jian noodle was far worse: the noodles were so mushy there were actually hunks of smashed together starchy mush that bore no resemblance to having previously been noodles, and the tiny tidbits of meat they used were so fermented they actually tasted spoiled. We barely finished to chow mein, and chose to leave the other one unfinished. I don't always let bad reviews of places stop me, but definitely steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"What a rip off! Crappy food at ridiculous prices.

I ordered soup and kung pao chicken - neither were very good - and was charged $9 for the soup, $20 for the entree and $5 extra if I wanted noodles. And that was for lunch. The quality was below a Pei Wei or Panda Express. Really!

The wait staff had absolutely no personality and seemed like they couldn't care less about anything other than taking your order and slinging it out."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I am in Vegas for the noodles. They are delicious. Don't expect great service, however, they are often slow and sometimes impolite. The environment is also a little loud and garish, so I prefer to sit at the bar near where the noodles are. It's a bit quieter there. Despite that, the hand crafted noodles are worth the trip."}
{"text":"The decor of Beijing Noodle No. 9 is awesome but like most Vegas' places that's all there is to it for what they charge... eh-hem overpriced meals. I came here for a work lunch as everywhere else had a 30 minute wait. Ordered an ice tea, not bad, and then the beef chow fun. The beef chow fun was not bad, kind of greasy and the beef was overcooked. Noodles are made fresh in house so thumbs up. Service left little to be desired and even though I did not pay for the meal I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here on 12-29-2011. The place was jumping, and we had to wait a few minutes. While waiting, we watched one of the chefs expertly making hand-made noodles. We were excited to eat hand-made noodles.

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the anticipation. The noodles were overpriced and small in portion, compared to what you would get in Chinatown.  I had the Lan Zhou noodle. I lived in Monterey Park, CA, for a number of years and was used to high quality Chinese noodle dishes. The handmade noodle at Beijing No. 9 tasted good and was properly cooked. However, the broth it was swimming in was weak and lacked punch, and perhaps cooked to appeal to broader tastes. 

My partner had a noodle salad dish that was overpowered by Hoisin sauce and ruined by tough tiny chunks of beef that resembled cat food. The Lan Zhou noodle came with thin meager slices of beef that was quite flavorful. We shared the Hainanese chicken dish. I've had this dish in Southeast Asia, and it is one of my favorite chicken and rice dishes. At Beijing No. 9, the rice was dry, the chicken slices were pathetically nonexistent and bony (and did not include the breast meat with skin), and they did not serve the dish with a side of chicken broth like other restaurants do. Awful dish for about twenty dollars.

We went to this restaurant because it was highly recommended and they received rave reviews from Bon Appetit. We would not have minded paying the higher prices if the dishes had been remotely good. However, only go here if you're trapped at Caesar's and can't get to Chinatown. If you can get off the strip, go to the myriad noodle places and Chinese restaurants in Chinatown for superb noodles at less than half the price they charge at Caesar's. 

Finally, I'm wondering how wise it is to put so many goldfish in the tanks; they seemed to have no space to move around. There's no reason to subject the goldfish to such overcrowding."}
{"text":"Stunning!

Excellent food (thumbs up for the scallion pancake) and efficient service in one of the most striking rooms you'll ever dine in - it's something of a clean-modern-paper-cut motif - just beautiful. 

Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

Okay, so I understand this place isn't going compare to any of he excellent Northern Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley. But, I was hopeful after speaking to the staff, many of which were from China. They described the food as being excellent.

The first problem with the place were the prices. I expected it to be overpriced, but this was ridiculous. I guess the lease in Caesars Palace doesn't help, nor does the beautifully decorated interior. All that being said, I expected the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of each dish to be much better. 

We ordered the Pad Fried Dumplings(Gyoza), Braised Baby Bok Choy, Mapo Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup and Pan Fried Pork Pancakes. None of these dishes were spectacular. The Bok Choy was okay, the gyoza were very small and the quantity was pitiful. The highlight was the Beef Noodle soup, it was good and the chunks of beef were nicely braised. The mapo tofu was terrible, nothing like what it's supposed to be. 

The service was good and they have some interesting beverages, but this place definitely caters to the American tourist. Like many of the other reviews you can get all of the dishes served here for half the price in any Chinatown."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours butt there could be a wait.  A lot of Asian diners, good sign.  Known for the noodle soup $28, i ordered the seafood hot and sour soup $15.  Usually you can buy this for $4 at most Chinese restaurants. I had the munchies and was craving soup but i wouldn't dine here again.  Service was ok.  Asthetically, the restaurant is really clean and art deco with tanks of gold fish."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday during lunch- NO WAIT!

Anyway, would've preferred a different interior- the walls sort of just made me feel like I was going crazy. Also the goldfish tanks were cool, but my friend and I came up with a theory that they had that many goldfish in each tanks so you couldn't see when one died. 

The food was great! It was quite filing, and didn't take long to come out. We split a dumpling and a noodle plate, and it was just filling enough- portions are not big. The service, on the other hand, was crap. 

I'm a noodle whore, so I enjoyed it. Will probably go back if I'm near."}
{"text":"Good food but you guys need to fire that hostess Chu. Her service is terrible. If she hates her job that much tell her to quit. She killed this experience and unfortunately we won't be back. A simple request for a menu and she has the nerve to say you can ask your server if you need something. Really? Good luck with anyone else that has to deal with her."}
{"text":"The price is really expensive for a MEHH chinese restaurant. Maybe it is because it located inside the caesar palace.
I tried their noodle dishes which is just OKAY nothing special.
Uhh.. I don't have anything else to say about this restaurant except for the high price and just okay food that is not worth it. That's the only memorable things about this restaurant haha :P
OHH! they have lots of gold fish in the aquarium in front of the restaurant haha :)"}
{"text":"Given that it's located in Caesars Palace, I didn't expect this place to be cheap, even if it is Chinese food. However, I thought that the pricing was way off of what it should have been. Don't get me wrong; the food is good. We had the braised beef brisket hand pulled noodle soup, xiao long bao, and Beijing beef pancake wrap. All three were good, just not great. And for what it was, it simply wasn't worth the money.

Some problems I had with the place: the hostesses were unfriendly, the service was a little slow, and they didn't have a bunch of the desserts listed on their menu."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  By far one of my favorite spots in Caesers.  I don't even care that people gave them low reviews.  

I went here twice over Memorial weekend and both times i ordered the Beijing Noodles with Eggplant.  DELICIOUS.  It leaves me craving more.  The noodles, the sauce, the eggplant chunks.  

I'm actually wondering if i can recreate this dish at home?? Hmm...."}
{"text":"people who complain abou the prices...dude. it's SOOO much cleaner than other chinese restaurants. if u want cheap stuff, don't go to a restaurant in a las vegas hotel. go order take out. the food is pretty good...it's beijing style so pretty light but i thought it was good. i can understand people who think it doesn't taste good because it's not loaded with MSG and soy sauce like other places. in that case go order out from some americanized chinese place
I think people who like real Chinese good made like the stuff from china will enjoy it. the handmade noodles were great. my 80 year old grandparents said it's been such a long time since they had this authentic beijing food and homemade noodles...the fried rice is light and buttery like GOOD fried rice. not the 4 dollar kind u order from every other place that is mixed with a bunch of soy sauce and other chemicals which = kidney stones or arteries clogging. it's all light and healthy. people who give it a bad review just don't understand real chinese food. they just like the bad shitty kind u get everywhere else. 
the prices aren't great but what do you expect...every food joint in the big hotels on the strip try to rip u off."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times being that our big tradeshow of the year is at Caesar's and there are limited lunch options. They do take reservations now (during the tradeshow times at least) because it can get EXTREMELY packed. The lines at lunch can be up to an hour wait so I would recommend making reservations by calling or through opentable. 

The food here is as decent as I would expect it to be. The dumplings (pork, shrimp, steamed, fried) are all done well and fairly tasty. Both the dry and soup noodles are not impressive by any means, but not terrible. My boss is Chinese and she loves it so as far as authenticity goes, it can't be terrible. 

The service is where they lack the most. The food comes out terribly slowly and the waitresses/waiters lack much grace or manners. Even the managers tend to be somewhat rude and abrupt, but again, I manage my expectations. The bill won't be cheap, however this is Vegas and what meal other than McDonald's is really low budget?

Overall, it isn't terrible and you could certainly find better options, but during a Caesar's tradeshow or event, good luck finding a table anywhere for lunch. Beijing gets the job done and that's all I can really ask for."}
{"text":"My first experience was fantastic. I went for lunch on a Friday. There was no wait and service was excellent. We ordered chicken dish and the noodle soup with wontons. I would give that experience a 4 star. The second time we went, it was on a Sunday night at 9 pm and there was a 30 minute wait. The service was terrible and the food was not the best. I don't recommend anyone order the coconut curry or the chicken chow mein. Save a trip to a Thai restaurant for coconut curry and walk down and across the street to PF Changs( not kidding you- and I hate chains!) for the chow mein.  Not only will it save you lots of money but it will taste better and you'll get better service."}
{"text":"Although not as good as when it first opened a few years ago it's still worth it as it's authentic Chinese food. The big dissapointment is that it's way too expensive for a Chinese noodle and dumpling restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a great place to  visit  when we  come  home  to  Vegas. The  pot stickers are  very  flavorful. The  won ton soup  full  of  noodles and won tons. The  shrimp  fried rice is amazing. Don't  let  the  white  color  fool  you. It's  full  of  flavor. The  Singapore noodles are  perfect not too spicy. Everything  we  have  tried  is  fabulous."}
{"text":"************* REVIEW 94 ****************

Beautiful entrance with gigantic fishtanks into a casual Chinese noodle joint inside the Caesars Palace Hotel & Casino. 

Beijing Noodle No.9 offers selections of soup, dim sum, noodle and rice dishes and chef's specialties. Unfortunate, I ordered the dumpling and wonton noodle soup, basic dishes & my business associates ordered brisket beef noodle soup. All dishes were not flavorful. Especially my broth was plain. The dumpling was really dry inside. 

Wish we could have gone to to Noodle @ the Bellagio or RED8 @ the Wynn. 

Service was attentive and on point. Love the gigantic fish tanks!"}
{"text":"Other than the beautiful decor, there is really not a whole lot to this place.  If you have a craving that just cannot wait and you are at Caesar's then you don't have much choice.  The garlic pepper crab was not too bad and was probably the best dish we had.  But most of the other dishes are extremely salty because it is Beijing style, but the chef has a particularly high salt palate, even then.  The waitress admitted that they get a lot of complaints about the saltiness of the food, but there is nothing they can do about it.

Service is an atrocity - textbook for what you should NOT do.  We were seated at a table that was filthy underneath.  When I pointed this out to the hostess, she told me to just change seats.  They refused to clean it up.  She has to be one of the laziest people I have met in my life.  I was going to complain to the manager, but even she is a piece of work.  We sat next to the kitchen, and I guess one of the other tables sent back a dish because it was too salty.  Then she and the staff started to bad mouth the customer right in front of us.  Of course, it was in Chinese, but we still understood.  She used the entire gamut of expletives to describe the customer and started to give them a dirty look every time she walked by their table. Loosely translated, it went something like - eff them, they don't know s**t, nit picking.

WOW.

This place will never again have my business.  With an attitude like that and such disregard for customer respect, I cannot trust what they will do to my food if I ever made even a slight complaint.

So I know what the 9 in restaurant name stands for. Nine reasons why should not eat here"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype about this restaurant besides the dramatic entrance of the giant fish tanks. I've ordered their braised pork belly, salt and pepper chicken, Beijing Pancake that was all so, so.  Nothing to brag about. I must say that the fresh noodle dishes are good because they make the noodles from scratch."}
{"text":"Horrible Asian food! We walked by and saw the soups with \"fresh noodles\"! This place is nasty and over priced!  If you walk by the smell of the food and soup dishes does draw your attention but keep walking.. You are better off going to china town for some Pho Kim Long"}
{"text":"Pretty? Yes.
Good food? As Yelp says with a 2-star review... MEH.

After eating a few days of even very good French or American food, I tend to crave something Asian, and instead of doing some research to find something off the strip, I got lazy and decided to try this place.  

And of course, in Las Vegas Strip fashion, it was way overpriced for what it was.  We tried the dan dan noodles, 3 different types of dim sum, and rice... the price: over $50.  Umm.. not cool.   The food was okay, but nothing spectacular and definitely nothing worth the amount we paid."}
{"text":"Very pretty restaurant. Food is good as well. I had the soup dumplings and they were tasty. The reason it's only a 4 star because of the horrible service. Not many patrons in the store and there was enough staff but they kept ignoring us and everything took forever including getting the bill."}
{"text":"Food is terrible and service is mediocre.  Only reason I ate here is because it's the only choice if your craving noodle soup and I didn't have time to go off strip to China Town.   Also, other than the noodles all the floured items like dumping and flat noodles is all pre-made frozen processed.  Stay away unless you're  desperate."}
{"text":"Went there late, about midnight (they are open  24/7). There were only four tables with people at them so slow.  
Yet....
-HORRIBLE service. 
-Overly bright lights and ultra white decor made it feel like an operating room.
-It took them an hour to make two dishes on this slow night.
-After ordering drinks, we were totally ignored until the food arrived an hour later.
-Had to go and ask for water.
-The two dishes we had were excellent. (Then again I was ravenous by the time it arrived!)
-Vegetarian dish was $26. It was outstanding.
-Noodles with beef dish was $29. It was very good.

Will not return, food may have been awesome but the service simply sucked.

FYI - Floors are slippery so anyone in heels beware."}
{"text":"The restaurant should've called itself shanghai 9 or something bc the food is not at all Beijing-ish. The noodles were good, and that was the only reason i'm giving a star. Plus Yelp won't let me give a zero."}
{"text":"I lived in SF for three years, so I'm a bit spoiled in terms of dim sum. Went here for dinner with my family for some dim sum. We ordered one of everything of the dumplings. They didn't seem super fresh (frozen?) and were just ok. The dumplings were a bit on the small side and overpriced for sure. Maybe next time we'll just do regular Americanized Chinese food. 

Service was fast and friendly - teapot refilled several times, water glasses never empty for long. The decor is trippy, but fun and different. Overall, pricey.... And I don't like it when restaurants have fish tanks and you can see dead fish. I was looking for them, so maybe that's not fair, but still."}
{"text":"Have been here before, but did not write a review.  The decor is beautiful, it makes you feel as if you were under the water.  The wait/host staff are a little austere but efficient.  The food is the star.  The DanDan Mien is flavorful with just the right amount of spice, the BBQ platter was cooked perfectly - pork, duck and chicken all juicy and delicious.  We also ordered the eggplant and string beans which were tender and succulent (not soggy in the sauce at all)!  An incredible meal and great cocktails!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to go to Chinese restaurants inside fancy hotels, but since I was already staying here and I was feeling a bit under the weather with a bit of a throat problem (non-contagious!), I thought since all the other restaurants in the hotel had pretty rich and spicy dishes on their menus, that a simple bowl of fish congee or soup noodles would be perfect. I went for the seafood and dumpling egg noodle soup. Since they seemed to be displaying the noodle station at the front of window of the restaurant, I figured this must be one of their specialties.

Oh boy. The soup was kind of tasteless, the noodles were ok, but a very small portion, the 2 shrimp and 2 scallop were large and fresh, but the dumpling......what the....?!?!? I think it was supposed to be some kind of wonton dumpling, but I took one bite and noticed a really dark stuffing in it....not sure what was inside, but it was cold! I was too hungry to complain and send it back, so I just left the dumplings til the end hoping that the warm (not hot) soup would warm it them up a bit.

And this for $20+?! Yikes.....I guess if I had taken a cab to Chinatown for the same bowl of noodles, the cab fare, bowl of noodles, tax and tip would have likely come to the same amount. The quality definitely wasn't worth that much, but I guess the rent must be pretty high.

I was thinking of going back at dinner time to try the fish congee, but then changed my mind after some thought. Ok, so it's probably a bit unfair to judge a restaurant based on a bowl of noodles....but then again, I don't think I want to press my luck a second time. If you're truly desperate for something to eat and can't think of any other decent place, then ok, it's probably edible quality. However, I would have preferred to take a cab to Chinatown....or even Panda Express across the road.

The service wasn't bad, but pretty much typical of any Chinese restaurant. Nice decor though....I'll give them that. I had a bad experience staying at this hotel so I will likely not come back here again."}
{"text":"Ate here with my girlfriend and the entire experience was amazing.  From getting seated right away, to the service, and of course, the delicious food, Beijing Noodle No. 9 was a great place to eat.

For drinks, I ordered the Thai Iced Tea and it's pretty much the best Thai Iced Tea I've drank in a long time.  It tasted authentic and was reasonably priced.  For entrees, we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, Walnut Prawns, the Pan-Fried Pork and Chive Dumplings, and steamed white rice.

All dishes were extremely delicious, but the Walnut Prawns were what stood out for me.  They were very succulent, tasty, and provided more than enough for me to finish (but I did anyway).

All in all, a great restaurant to eat at and definitely recommended.  I would come back to Beijing Noodle No. 9 - I'm sure the other items on the menu are just as good as the dishes I tried there, or even better."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRE AT BEST. This place has \"chinese food\". If you are looking for real authentic chinese food you SHOULD NOT come here. Its like a glorified Panda Express."}
{"text":"I'd really give this a 2.5 star rating, but it lucks out and gets the extra half star...

This place is pretty new in Caesar's (within the past year or so since my last stay here).  One night I didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so decided to try the Beijing Noodle No. 9 with two friends.  The entrance is really cool, with lots of goldfish swimming in tanks along the entryway.  

The hostess seated us, and our old waiter came over to us.  He was so not friendly, we had to laugh a few times at him.  He literally acted like he hated us and we were bothering him by sitting at his table.  Then again, he was an old Chinese man, so maybe that's how they do it in Beijing??  I don't know...but he was pretty gruff.

The food was decent, and probably the cheapest meal you can get in Vegas besides Battista's Hole in the Wall.  They do the hand stretched noodles and it's pretty cool to see the guys doing it in the kitchen, which you can see from the dining room.  Our waiter did grace us with his presence long enough for us to ask a few questions about things, but we didn't really get much in the way of answers from his responses.  We sort of just had to guess because he really didn't explain anything we asked about.  We did okay though.  We shared three different noodle dishes, and they were all good.  We also started off with some pork buns, which weren't that great, and the vegetarian fried spring rolls, which were pretty good.  Nothing stood out at all, so the food was just okay.  

The next night I was sick and didn't want to even leave my room, so I ordered take out.  This night was much better.  The hostess was super nice and helped me with my order without being a strange old man about it.  I got the small seafood hand streched noodle soup, the seaweed salad, and the shrimp & pork dumplings.  This was the perfect amount of food: two small appetizers and a small soup.  I got it up to my room and it was much better than the night before.  The seaweed salad was really quite tasty, and had yummy shaved cucumbers in it.  The dumplings weren't as successful because the filling had an odd texture and odd taste.  I only ate 2 of the 4...not so great.  The soup was pretty much what I needed for a sick night in.  Shrimp were tasty, noodles were good, and the broth was nice and light.

This place is definitely not great...but it's adequate.  sometimes adequate is all you need."}
{"text":"Service was nice and expedient. I ordered the green onion pancake and the beef brisket noodle soup. The food was decent, nothing particularly extraordinary. The atmosphere does really draw you in with the decor, kitchen design, fish tank and lighting. To be all the way honest you could probably get the same quality off the strip for half the cost. The meat was tender and delicious and the food seasoned just enough."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for late-night Chinese food! They are opened 24hrs; food is quick and delicious. My favorite menu item, eggplant and green bean stir-fry, is off the menu since their menu recently changed, but I am happy that I can order it every time! Black pepper sirloin and asparagus is another favorite of mine. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the service isn't always great and it's a bit of a hassle to get to because it's inside of Ceasars. This is mostly a good and casual place to go to when you're hungry and it's late."}
{"text":"I had a conference in Caesars Palace for a little over a week and I would sneak down to Beijing Noodle No. 9 for lunch every chance I got.

Initially, all I could think about was the cool decorations.  There are columns and sections of wall filled with water and real goldfish.  The ceiling and the floor matched the contemporary, watery-fish decoration so it's almost like sitting in a room that Michael Jackson considers his \"fishy room.\"  A little off-putting but still very cool.

The food itself was excellent.  I cannot rave enough about the Kung Pao Chicken which is easily the best item on the menu.  That dish contains all white meat and hardly any fat.    I feel like a perverse old man describing an Olsen twin but oh well.

My co-workers ordered several other somewhat mainstream Chinese dishes and they were solid.  The restaurant also offers sushi but it was mediocre at best.

Beijing Noodle is expensive but it's Vegas and I challenge you to find a cheaper on-strip restaurant.

The wait staff was very nice and responsive, I don't think I had to ask for more water once in my 5 or 6 visits.  But because it's so easily accessible to Caesars Palace patrons, it can get pretty busy at times so make a reservation or else you'll be waiting a few minutes for a table."}
{"text":"If you don't have a car to leave the strip for Chinese food, then I guess this is the place to go to.  Located in Caesar's Palace, my wife and I checked out the menu and decided to give it a try.

The decor is great and modern.  But we waited awhile for the food we ordered.  We only ordered 2 dishes.  We ordered salt and pepper chicken and beef chow fun.  Both dishes were great.  

This place is expensive though.  And the service was just ok.  So if you have a lot of money to spare for food you can get for half the price off the strip, eat here."}

Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected. 

My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)

The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited. 

Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out. 

The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl. 

The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl. 

Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express."}
{"text":"I stopped by at 6 today (Feb 6, 2017) asking the hostess questions about my reservation. Surprisingly, she doesn't understand what I'm talking about and tried to explain in Chinese. I mean I understand it's a Chinese restaurant, but shouldn't a hostess know at least how to speak in English? I told her I can't speak Chinese and she just use her \"English\" and try to explain to me. I mean I just don't understand. I think the manager should be aware of what kind of people they are hiring."}
{"text":"Food -overpriced , congee with no flavor at all (Malaysia chow mien is the only one I like
)
Service- waiter looked super tired, maybe they should have a better shift arrangement 

P.s. the spoons and plates are a bit dirty, a big NO for a restaurant 

Would not recommend at all, go to Aria for Lemongrass and Bellagio for Noodles
These two are the best Asian food restaurants here"}
{"text":"To be fair, most waiting in line here are pissed, grouchy, and hungry who refuse to wait 2+ hours for the Bacchanal buffet. Let's be humbly uber real. 

We naively thought the buffet line would be reasonable during the weekend. Oops... 0_0

These poor folks are the closest restaurant that will do during lunch or early dinner (as I call \"linner\"). 

They're scrutinized big time since we cannot enter the Bacchanal. Because of that I chose to review them much later. 

Now w/all that being said, I think it's par to give them 3 stars.

I agree w/most concerning the prices. There's nothing special about their food except for their convenience. 

The food was edible but if you're starving, anything dead will do. My beef chow foon (same as drunken noodle) tasted as it should and his kung pao chicken was flavored properly. We looked at each other and said \"3 stars\". 

Memorable bites were from the green onion pancakes but I'm partial to fried carbs. 

Finally we give kudos to the line hostess. She asked each small group if they'd like to sit at the front bar stool section when any opened up. We took the offer to jump the line. 

Lesson learned regarding the wait time for the famous Bacchanal buffet."}
{"text":"Despite observing numerous negative Yelp reviews--often railing about lacking value for a high monetary outlay--I had long wanted to dine here to see for myself.  Since Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a Strip restaurant, the high prices should not be surprising.  And, noting that ratings for food had recently risen, I at last ventured out to see for myself.  And I'm glad I did.  Because food and service were mostly excellent, including perhaps the best Shrimp Chow Mein I have experienced.   

We began with Har Gow Shrimp Dumplings, which arrived in a bamboo basket.  With a slightly sticky and jiggly exterior when touched, and a delicious hot shrimp center, this was a filling and satisfying starter.

Next up was a bowl of Seafood Hot & Sour Soup.  It was heat hot and very good, but with clusters of Black Trumpet Mushrooms and cut up scallops, somewhat unusual.  The portion supplied was that of a small bowl but adequate.  Because the soup was not too spicy, the flavors came through nicely.

Honey Walnut Prawns were superlative, with a mayonnaisey dressing that was amply applied and sweet, but not cloyingly so.  And the eight crustaceans were clearly large prawns--not mere shrimps.  It was amazing that Diane was able to consume the entire entree in one sitting.

I also barely finished all of my Shrimp Chow Mein which was studded with medium-sized shrimps embedded in delicious swirls of homemade noodles.  From habit I reached for the Soy Sauce, but then withdrew it as I began tasting Chow Mein Noodles that were already perfectly oiled in soy.  Once all noodles and shrimp had disappeared in my gullet, I finished with an ice cold Mochi Sampler: a tasty trio of Mango, Strawberry, and Green Tea Ice Cream.

The overworked hostess was all business but very professional.  I observed that she had to reset tables besides entertain reservations and seat hungry diners.  We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, and were seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  

Service, too, was excellent.  Dishes came out quickly and accurately, and water glasses and a pot of hot and fragrant Jasmine Tea were refilled without request.  While the feel of the restaurant is cool rather than warm, with a scalloped cut out ceiling and walls, and sleek but contemporary tables and chairs, this ambiance fits well with the watery environment of the goldfish-filled aquariums that lead into the dining room.

Calling it as I experienced my single outing, XXXX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"This is a place of extremes, the is the result of a bunch of 5s on the plus side and a bunch of 1s on the minus:

On the plus side
- Beautiful decor
- Wonderful fish tanks
- Server uniforms that match the orange of the goldfish (cool)
- High quality food; this is gourmet caliber noodles

On the negative side
- Ridiculous expensive / small portions of the price
- Slow service, even when it's not full.  Chronically understaffed.
- Often a line to get in.  Even when it's not full.  And then you get cut-off by the Seven Stars / Diamond members, adding to your wait.

Things we loved
- Seabass
- Shu mai
- Potstickers (disguised as pork and chive pan-fried dumplings)
- Wor won ton soup"}
{"text":"I really love seafood.
Seafood Noodle Soup, hand stretched noodles, perfect!"}
{"text":"I was definitely expecting better food quality. I'm from Beijing, so it was bugging me when the menu looked like the chef came from Hong Kong. The tomato and egg noodle did not taste like home. It was missing quite a few ingredients and tasted sweet."}
{"text":"When you walk by this place in Caesars, you are automatically intrigued by the bright lighting, modern decor, fish tanks, and live demonstration of handmade noodles, but looks are deceiving when it comes to Noodle No. 9. Where to start...

Service was horrible and slow. There are slight communication barriers as well, which do not help the experience. Waitresses were running around aimlessly like a chicken with its head cut off, so I suggest having all orders ready when attended to because who knows when you will be again. Although you may be even ready with your order because it takes them forever to get to you in the first place. 

Don't expect much from the food too. Noodle soups and dishes were amazingly bland and tasteless. Food came in reasonable large portions, but when you factor in the taste, you pay too high a price for below average Chinese food. I did enjoy my shui mai appetizer, whether they were freshly made or not, they were pretty good... and huge too, it was shui mai on steroids!

They also have a good selection of teas. We got the Thai iced tea, and although it is known for its sweetness, this tea was over the top way too sweet. We also ordered one of the Jasmine iced teas with boba. Their iced teas are refreshingly sweet, a cup of that to go while you are walking in the 100 degree desert weather isn't such a bad idea. 

Overall, try this place at your own risk, but you have been forewarned and have a high chance of walking out disappointed."}

When your hungover as F*#K and in caesars palace this is the place to go to get some hot soup to cure that hangover! been here many times cause im way to hung over to go anywhere and room service doesn't have what you need. soup, noodles everywhere, if your looking for it they probably have it, chinese noodles and soup and chinese food only though (THEY NEED TO SERVE PHO) but anyways i always start with the chinese breadsticks or donut?! than won ton soup with egg noodles cant go wrong, they def use out of the packet egg noodle but its still good, i haven't had any problems with food here but the service is pretty bad; you order, get your food and thats it you will not see your server till your ready to pay? weird or coincidence? Anyways i only go here when im hungover so i cant really give the best rating but so far ive had a decent experience so nothing bad to say here"}
{"text":"2/16/18- Chinese New Year!!!
Ate a late dinner after the Elton John concert. The hostess was very rude and unacomodating, many minutes passes before she would be forced to acknowledge us. At this point we are tired and against our better judgement stayed to be seated. Once seated service was poor and slow. My husband's meal, seafood wonton soup was served 12 minutes before my meal came out. I ordered pan fried noodles and beef and they served me beef chow mein. At this point we just wanted out. Very disappointed!  
Sorry, we didn't speak Chinese like many of the other guests. We were literally ignored.

Let's clarify. The pan fried noodles with steak appear separately on the menu, when ordering I even asked to clarify. I didn't want the very soft mushy noodle that was served. EVEN when she placed the entree she said chow mein, again at now close to midnight and waiting, we just wanted to eat something and be out.

Your food was not great that night."}
{"text":"agree with most reviewers - the only cool thing about this place is the decor (the goldfish tanks and the use of white).  we ordered 2 noodle dishes, 2 apps, and an entree.  The two noodle dishes were ok - a bit overpriced but it's a vegas hotel restaurant so i accepted it.  The two apps we got were soup dumplings and some beef patty bun thing.  Both were horrible.  The soup dumplings didn't have any soup.  The beef patty buns were tasteless.  But the worst dish was the entree.  We got the Spicy chicken dish (the one that comes with peanuts).  AWFUL!  The chicken was DRY and overall, the dish was very bland in flavor.  I suggest just trying the noodle if you really want to stop in.  There are better places to eat on the strip for the price!"}
{"text":"I won't enter this place. Mediocre food l, nothing is really tasty ;( and the service is ok at best.
We tried the shrimp dumplings that were not tasty. The seafood soup was ok, the beef soup was also ok. We took one dish that was so horrible that we replaced it. To top it all this place is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Was in vegas this past weekend to celebrate my fiancé's birthday. We decided to give this place a try because we didn't want to wait inline for the Sunday brunch buffet.

We were seated almost immediately. Our server came over and took our drink orders. Surprisingly they didn't have just regular coffee.  But not an issue. We took awhile to figure out what we all wanted and the server was super nice about it. She kept coming back to check on us and finally took our orders.

Not sure what took so long, but our food didn't come out as quick as we expected given that we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. 

I ordered roasted duck and bok choy with egg noodle soup and my fiancé ordered roast pork and egg noodle soup. There were a couple of others that ordered other noodle soups, but I didn't try any of theirs.

Both soups were a little salty. The broth would have been great if there was just a little less salt in them. I realized that almost everything I ate that weekend was a little salty. Not sure if that's something that vegas does to help with hang overs or what, but too salty for my taste.

Otherwise food was ok. Service was great."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special. I had the chicken and mushrooms with hand pull noodle and it was overly salty and the noodles were not as dense as I would have expected. Almost a little mushy. Service was fine, but for a specialty noodle  place you better get the noodles right."}
{"text":"The fried rice is supposed to have shredded pork, beef, chicken and shrimp. I only found 3 pieces of chicken. The chicken and mushroom with hand pull noodle only had 1 mushroom and no chicken. There was something hard the size of a dime that was so dark and hard that might have been a piece of chicken. The beef with hand pull noodle tasted delicious, but there was no beef only gristle. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I have ever had. 45 minute wait time and exorbitant prices to have food that have no salt or spice."}
{"text":"There was no line and no wait here on a Saturday evening. After dining here, I know why. The wait staff was not too friendly. We were seated quickly but received our first trickle of ice water about 10 minutes later. Our cucumber salad with garlic had enough garlic to season a month's worth of salad. Yikes! Hand-stretched noodles seemed a good choice for the Shanghai Pork/Veggie Mein but it was soo salty with an almost burnt bean taste. We also ordered the vegetable spring rolls and they were fried on the outside but mealy and un-done on the inside. Ick.  If it were up to me, I'd tell you to skip it and find something better."}
{"text":"I loved the hand-pulled noodles here. The prices are as reasonable as you're going to find on the strip, and the restaurant itself is very beautiful and inviting. The menu is a bit more adventurous than you usually find in a Chinese restaurant. I was really happy I ate here."}
{"text":"This place sucks, the food was gross and tasted like grease. I will never go here. Again. EVER.... sure the entrance looks cool and the waiters can be very nice but the food simply is gross. tasted like cheap 99cent food. do not go here. the food shot out of me quicker then it went in."}
{"text":"From when I first walked into the restaurant, I had some bad vibes with it. As I looked through the menu, I was stunned on how much everything cost. I was really hoping for some real quality food, but I was wrong. I even had a waiter who did not serve us with respect and did not even refill our drinks. We ordered the combo fried rice. The dish was over powered by a buttery taste and the shrimp obviously tasted frozen and not fresh. Totally not worth $30. We also ordered a simple dish like General Tso, which to my surprise, was the only thing that tasted good for its price ($17). Ordered different noodles, like their signature black bean noodle. Was not surprised that it did not please me. Overall, I was dissatisfied with the quality of food, their customer service, and the pricing and portions of their food. Sure, it has to have competative prices, but at least have some good quality food. I could have gotten way better Chinese food at a take out place for a quarter of the price and twice the amount of food. 10/10 would not visit again."}
{"text":"The price is way too high for the food. The food is decent but you can find the same food on Spring Mountain road for 1/3 the price. I had the Shichuan Dan Dan Mein and Stir-fry Lamb with Cumin. Both were ok. The portions were on the small side. The service is zombie-like and the decor is plasticky. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I don't care what other people say, they cant talk me out of it, I am determined!
I want this food!
I love the chow mein and everything else here.
I don't care I even love this chow mein for breakfast.
Service is top notch superior quality they are always there for your wants and needs!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.. Love the decor, the steamed BBQ pork buns, I got BBQ platter with duck, pork, and chicken..."}
{"text":"One of the many restaurants in Caesars Palace. We order: braised pork ribs in caramelized vinegar, braised egg plant with spicy garlic sauce, brown rice, and jasmine tea. One thing, I am fairly good at is knowing my foods. The waiter brought us oolong tea, but he persisted in telling me this awkward tale of how the same teas can differ in taste. I could tell it was oolong tea looking at it and the aroma. I was ok with the tea. The meal was really great and plentiful. First time having ribs with caramelized vinegar and I look forward to finding them again somewhere when I am not in Las Vegas. The eggplant, and needless to say me and my family will devour eggplant if it is on the table. Small problem with the eggplant, the bottom of the plate was full of oil. After the meal, I had a great conversation with our waiter, and then he agreed the tea was not jasmine tea, and that Americans, in general, do not like their food swimming in oil. Bejing #9 and the rest of the Bejing chain, can easily be 4 star restaurants if they care for their customer a tiny bit more and pay attention to food prep before it goes to the table. I will, no doubt, find another Bejing Restaurant the next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical about Noodle places, being spoiled by a local place in San Diego called OB Noodle House, I was hungry so I decided to just walk in and try this place, I could not find something that I craved so I asked for a custom BBQ Pork Chow Mein and they said they can do it, when they brought that thing over it smelled like noodle heaven, so I took a bite, it was delicious, the portion was huge! I finished all of it and was more than satisfied, needless to say the experience was the best, group that meal with unsweetened tea and its a complete meal!"}
{"text":"This would have been a 2 star rating based on the quality of food and the service.  But I had to drop it down to a 1 given the price.  $37 for sauteed chicken and vegetable fried rice?  Get out of here.  Especially when you expect things to be GOOD at a Casino of this caliber.  The food, the chicken... tasted like soggy water.  The vegetables were bland, as if all the flavor was cooked out of them.  Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  If you're in the mood for some Chinese food... find another place, or get some different food, or better yet, save your money and buy a Snickers bar or something at a gas station because you'd be much better off than spending your money at this place."}
{"text":"So, I was really excited.  Cause Dao Xiao Mian is possibly my favorite food, EVER.  Which is maybe why I was so disappointed.  I just saw the window, with dao xiao mian and dragged my friends in right away.  I was starving too.  I was born in Beijing, and coming from San Francisco which is dominated by sichuan and cantonese style Chinese food, I was really excited to eat northern chinese food again(yes, I know dao xiao mian is not only served in Northern China but that's where I've had the best mian.)

The mian was alright, it wasn't great, but the large price tag(only tomatoes and eggs!), and the knowledge of how much it costs in China, just didn't sit well with me.  The dumplings are just average, and they had the premade frozen taste to them.  They taste like what I make and really, that's not good for a restaurant with real chefs.  The Xiao long bao was just average, again though, I'm probably spoiled as I'm used to the crab meat and roe ones from Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao.

To be completely fair though, I was comparing the prices to what I'd get in Beijing, for a little bit of homesickness, it was disappointing nonetheless.

Also, fish tanks were kinda weird for me.  Dead fish floating in there...."}
{"text":"THE ORDER: 
Pork Pancakes (OMG good) 
Won ton Soup (Bland & Boring) 
Shrimp Fried Rice (Bland & Boring) 
Beef w Hand Made Noodles (OK) 


YIPPEEE: 
Amazing Pork Pancakes. 
      Crunchy outside / hot & steamy middles. 
      Intense rich fresh pork & green onion flavor. 
      Wish i had 1 right now. Yummy!!! 

The restaurant is visually stunning. 
      Done in a white on white motif 
      The only color added by the goldfish tanks pops of golden orange. 

BOOO: 
OVER-PRICED!!! 
     I don't mind spending the money if it provides a mouth orgasm. 
     Sadly only the pancakes provided any kind of excitement. 

Hand made noodles:
     Seems special but are a let down. 
     Texture above average. 
           Nice firm tooth appeal 
     Beef and sauce it was in just OK.

{"text":"Wow Wow Wow...what a simplistic spectacle!  This pure white restaurant greets you with girls in orange dresses and tanks of large orange goldfish.  The contrast of these colors is magnificent and definitely something you don't get to see everyday.  Very cool. 

The food on the other hand....eh...kinda standard.  The chef stationed right in front of the restaurant is pulling noodles for all to see like he was some sort of zoo animal.  Hand pulled noodles are all the rage right now so you just have to let it be.  Given that, we ordered Noodles with Thin Sliced Beef and a Singapore Noodle dish with Curry.  Both dishes eatable and decent...neither dish worth going back for.  Prices were too high but since this is Las Vegas, anything goes I suppose (yes that rhymed.)

{"text":"Reading over the many reviews for this place, seems there are some hits and misses, could be who was cooking that day, who was serving, etc.  We had a good visit.  Staying at Caesars for a conference, we wanted a quick lunch and popped into this place.  Friendly hostess, very friendly server and very attentive staff (barely got a couple of sips on my water before someone was standing there refilling it to the brim).  I had the BBQ pork with noodles and it was VERY good.  Not bad on the check either, we were out of there after tax and tip for under $50 for a couple of entrees and tea.  Knowing how most restaurants inside the Caesars complex really jack up the prices (and to be honest, the quality of product and service doesn't justify it, they just do it because the can), the place was downright reasonable with great food and great service!  Enjoy!"}
