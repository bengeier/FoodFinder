{"text":"Have eaten at The Boot a few times they have really good pizzas and pastas and everything is really good same owners as Gingerman really good staff and a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. The atmosphere is unique with inspiration of a traditional pizzeria with a twist of English pub. The food is just ok. The pizza crust is razor thin and very crispy if you enjoy that style of pizza. The other options we tried were the pasta and meatball hoagie. The only downside of the restaurant is the entrance as it is almost a part of the main dining room. Everytime new customers walk in they seem to be right beside you while they are waiting for thier table. Also with the weather in Canada the cold draft everytime the door opened really put a \"chill\" in our experience at this restaurant- try eatting spaghetti with your winter parka on.. I would almost suggest to build an entry doorway outside of the building for people to wait and or break the draft when is cold or stormy. I would go back only in the summer though. Price is a bit steep for what you get. I did notice promotions though which is always awesome."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant on Kerr Street. Got the Fun Guy thin crust pizza, and it was delicious! It's not like the pizza you would get at Pizza Pizza or Domino's. It's more like gourmet pizza. Don't go expecting an overload of cheese or be surprised by the super thin crust.  Service was very quick, and the servers are super friendly."}
{"text":"Great little spot for fresh homemade plates. The pizza and panzerottis are above average. We had amazing homemade mozzarella sticks. Service is great!  Small spot so hard to get a table on a Friday or Saturday evening and if you do you'll be dining with strangers closely sitting next to you crammed in."}
{"text":"Things I have tried on their menu so far, all on point. A nice gem for a casual social over a drink or dinner. The patio area in the summer is my fav spot for officing. ;)"}
{"text":"Pizza like being back in Queens. Had the Italian Stallion w/peppers and a cold beer. Good service. Will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner, we both had high expectations as we had heard good things about the place. Firstly we thought we were going to an italian restaurant, but when we walked in and saw the TVs and the bar, we realized that it is a sports bar that has a pizza oven. We ordered a couple of pizzas, they were okay, a bit lacking in flavour, but seemed fresh. Place was extremely clean, staff was great and we were pleased with the customer service.  I personally wont be back because of the \"sports bar\" atmosphere, but if you like that sort of thing, it is nice to have a new place to try."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch today at The Boot Social Pizzeria.  It's in a strip mall.  It was such a nice day so I sat on the patio.  I love love love pizza and ordered a Mangiacake pizza (salami and mozza cheese) with speziato (spicy) sauce.  It was a good pizza.  The sauce did have some kick to it but it was okay.  The crust was thin and crispy."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great! It felt cozy and reminded me of a pub.   Service: Attentive and helpful. I was also super impressed with the service at the bar - when I asked about Italian wines he ended up giving me a tasting of 5 wines and a lesson about wine to boot!  Food: Just so-so. The pizza has a very thin, crispy crust and I thought it tasted dry. Some people at my table liked the pizza though so I think it's just a matter of opinion. I also wasn't a fan of the caponata - the onions in it were raw and I didn't like finding out there were raisins in it after I ordered it. The lemon cheesecake was delicious though!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Just ordered a plate of \"bad boys\" (grilled lamb skewers) and a pizza to share. The lamb skewers were small but really flavourful. I could eat them all day. The pizza on the other hand, was below average.  Given that this place is actually a pizzeria, shouldn't it be the other way around??  Anyway, the decor is nice and the black leather chairs are really comfy!"}
