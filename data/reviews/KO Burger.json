{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there on A Thursday afternoon and we received TERRIBLE customer service   - the cashier barely spoke to us, kinda just grunted and pointed at things, extremely rude  - several items listed on the menu were not available   - Stacks of filthy dishes right on the counter in front of register   - mediocre food but severely over priced (buffalo sauce was so \"vinegary\" we couldn't eat it)   - all of our food was stuffed in one paper bag that was ripped apart by the time we got home  - and lastly the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was very poor!"}
{"text":"I actually got yelp because of my experience here. Went there last night and it will be the last time.  To be honest I could of went to McDonald's and been more satisfied with my meal. The service was sub part to put it nicely the burger was dry( I got the flaming ko), the toppings were non-existent (I would of thought they mixed up order but the place was empty) onion rings were too greasy. Extreme burger is 10 times better!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews for restaurants but I feel like anybody wanting to go here should get a fair warning.  After passing by ko burger multiple times on my way home my girlfriend and I decided to try this place one day.   I wanted a chocolate milkshake and ended up getting what tasted like water mixed with chocolate milk. One sip and I wanted to throw the thing in the garbage.   The burger was chewy and bland and didn't taste quite right. We didn't even finish the food.   I was completely unimpressed with this place and suggest people thinking about trying it to save your money and go around the corner to the mcdonalds. Even one of their dollar menu burgers taste better than this crap.   I think it's pretty obvious but I will not be returning to this place! If I could give it a negative star review I would."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend because I saw it on a show a year back or so and it was a let down. The guy at the counter was uninterested in serving customers and he didn't even clean the table until I asked for cleaning supplies.   The food was bland at best. They don't use fresh ingredients and the milkshake was a joke. The chocolate milkshake consists of NESQUICK and MILK....so why did I pay $5 for it????? The pineapple on my burger was canned!!!  My friend ordered the Sloppy KO and it was not sloppy at all !!! I was I didn't come here NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Only gets one star because there isn't a no-star option. Ordered delivery from these guys and the driver was an hour and a half late, with nothing to say for himself but \"it was busy\". All the food was stone cold. When I called the restaurant to tell them what happened, they offered me a discount for my next order, which I guess seemed reasonable to them but WHY WOULD I ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN? Even if the food was hot, it would be mediocre at best. Never giving this place my custom again."}
{"text":"When FatCat buy something from dollar store and it breakdown, FatCat thinking \"no problem, FatCat only pay one dollar and expect cheap thing to break soon.\"  But when FatCat pay premium for burger, FatCat expect some quality. Unfortunately for FatCat he not get what he pay for at KO burger.  Things FatCat like  - Some unique combinations of toppings you not get anywhere else (doritos on burger - not too big deal, but something nice).  Things FatCat not like  - Quality of beef - FatCat thinking K.O using frozen beef patties for meat?  Not sure, but that's what it taste like to FatCat."}
{"text":"I liked my experience here.  This is a random, divey burger joint, so one shouldn't expect much in the way of decor or ambiance. I was here to satisfy a sudden burger craving, nothing more.  I was served by an Asian gentleman, who may have been the person referenced by another reviewer. In any event, my veggie burger was delicious and I was happy with the price.  I'll be back, and I'll likely try the Hawaiian."}
{"text":"New Owner ???? If it ain't broke don't try to fix it You had perfect recipes but you have chosen not to use them This is the worst delivery meal I've ever encountered.  I live 5 minutes up the road. The fries were 2 hours old and cold. The Burgers I think we're from lunch also stone cold and rubbery . I wouldn't even give my dogs left overs because I don't know as of yet if I'm going to get food poisening but I am going to put a sample in the fridge just in case Be prepared for a health department visit  One Star is over rated"}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken wings, which I've done many times before. Except this time they served me chicken wings that were raw inside. Not just one won't, like 8 out of my 20 were pink and raw inside.    Not acceptable. That's food poisoning just waiting to happen.   Never going ever again.    Steer clear."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burger joint in the city. The burger's texture is like rubber. It is VERY expensive for such bad quality. Customer service was god awful, and the wait time was ridiculously long. They were playing some good music and the graffiti logo on the wall is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Life lesson!!!!! Don't order lunch from someone who looks like they just rolled out of bed.  Atmosphere, place has a moldy smell when you walk in.  Service, there isn't any. Food, I couldn't even finish my burger. Attendant, slow and lost in his own world.  What else can I say......don't bother."}
{"text":"I went here because a friend hyped the place. It was buy one get one for $1.00 special so I picked up a couple 9 oz burgers for my roommate and I. There was literally nothing special about it. It was no different than what I make myself at home in a frying pan. The spicy garlic mayo didn't taste spicy or like garlic. The fried onions were pretty much raw. It was average-ish. Three stars because the worker was friendly and chatty, the food was edible, and the special was a good value. I probably won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a real disappointment, which is a let down because they are open late which is desperately what this area needs!. Besides the burgers being dry the unique burger orders are made with cheap ingredients and doused in Saracha if you order something spicy.   The chocolate milk shake I ordered was made with nesquick.....  Not to mention you are spending over 10$ per burger. I desperately wish this place was something worth going to"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers very often (like once a year at most), but when that annual burger time comes KO would be my pick.  It's not a place you go if you're in a rush, or looking for sterile professionalism and the finest ingredients, etc. There's a Hawaiian influence, but it's not a Hawaiian themed place. But there's definitely this laid back, let's have a good time, vibe that's super rare in the GTA.   TLDR: The regulars and staff are super fun."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while en route to the Chester Hill lookout. Menu is quite large however there are no ''combos'' (ie burger fries and drink) you have to pay separately for everything which can end up being pricey. Service was slow, but with only one person working at a time, it's not surprising. If you choose to build your own burger instead of buying one of the pre designed burgers you have to pay 50 cents for each topping.. which is CRAZY. Food was subpar, fries were good, but burger was very dry. Probably wouldn't visit again unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"After getting turned away from Square Boy - because I tried to pay with my debit card and they're cash only...who knew? - by the time I got to Broadview Stn. I was starving so I thought I'd try this place, since it's been in my hood for years now and I've never been.  While the price impressed me, the food didn't. I got a burger, sm fries and sm onion rings. The burger was, as many others have pointed out, DRY and there isn't much to it. If you're looking for one of those big, fat, voluptuous home burgers, don't look here because you'd be out of luck. It was not only dry, but it was small, rather tasteless and FLAT. Yep. Flat! Like someone took a burger and dropped a ten-pound weight on it.  While the fries and rings get points for not being greasy, they could have used a little more flavor.   Square Boy wanted to charge me $12.00 for what I got at Ko Burger which was only $7.00 but the big difference? Square Boy's food is better....a lot better!!  Next time I'll make sure I've got cash."}
{"text":"Great $5 lunch special however cleanliness is evidently not on managements top priority. Place honestly smelt like a bathroom but the burger was good. I'd suggest take out."}
{"text":"went here as i was just passing by en route to chester hill lookout.  they have a huge selection of meats to cook, from beef, to chicken, to lamb, to veggie.  a couple of issues, you can either do a \"pre\" set up burger(toppings, sauces, etc)  or you can make your own( which the first sauce is free, and then a 50 cent surcharge after each sauce is added) so far as toppings, im not sure if it is per topping.  where i was really surprised was with the burger and the poutine, not being a beef eater, i opted out for lamb, combined with the devils 66 toppings, the waitress/order taker/cook told me this would be the hottest thing that they have. BOY was i in for a shock, i literally had to take the maranated peppers off of my burger, it was so hot i was in tears and my nose instintly opened up. as well the poutine was delish! my only \"bitch\" the price was a bit expensive as there is no combo system, so you pay for everything seperatly. i had a milkshake for dessert which was very good as well really good flavor and qualitity.  small place, and small bathrooms though lol"}
