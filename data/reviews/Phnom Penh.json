{"text":"This food gets into your head...into your blood...into your soul!!!!    We've been eating at Phnom Penh for years.  My husband and I have cravings and we have to go there immediately.  There is nothing else in the world like it!  Sometimes I dream about the Beef Hue Soup and I have to go there the next day.  We love the pork pad thai, extra HOT.  Actually, we order just about everything extra hot that is supposed to be hot.  Sometimes we'll order pork Mi Koutang (excuse the spelling) but it's a flat noodle and vegetable dish with a sweet sauce.  It's the perfect thing to balance out screaming hot pad thai, hot hue soup and hot Cha Kra Mas Prat (again excuse the spelling).  All that I can say is YUMMO and guess where we're going for dinner tonight? Ha!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty mediocre, especially for the price. I would recommend looking for other SE Asian restaurants nearby. I got the Phnom Penh salad, which was mostly cabbage.... and for being almost $6--not worth it. The noodles, although they were only about $7, they were lacking all kinda of veggies or anything that are found in pho."}
{"text":"I was not happy with Phnom Penh.  Which is not to say it's bad, but that I had perhaps unreasonable expectations.  I've heard such rave reviews.  And I'm still searching for a good Thai take-out place right downtown for dreary winter nights.  But I should not have been fooled.  This place is Cambodian.  The food tastes Cambodian.  I don't like Cambodian food.  I should have known better.  But since I've had delicious Thai food in Cambodia, I thought maybe they would manage to pull it off.  I just got take-out.  Fried spring rolls were disappointing.  Just greasy and flavorless.  I'm always disappointed when fried food isn't good.  The Pad Thai was not good.  Not sweet at all, sort of sour and shockingly red, which was disturbing.  I also ordered the Cambodian curry, thinking that would be something they probably do well.  It just sort of left a salty astringent taste in my mouth.  Cambodian food just doesn't have the mellow sweetness Thai food mixes in with sour and hot.  But the prices are great, the location is clutch, and the number of dishes available is impressive.  Just know you're getting Cambodian food, not any sort of pan-East Asian."}
{"text":"This first picture on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/phnom-penh-cambodian-khmer-food-in-ohio.html) is of the Na Ting, which is an appetizer you have to get. My friend and I split it and it was absolutely delicious. You get little squares of fried, crisped rice and this savory soup mixture to go on top.   The menu is a small novel, so there's an awful lot of choices in what to get.  The flavors in the dishes were very complex, each of them like a unique symphony of tastes all going together!  The iced coffee was also very strong and very good. I would definitely go back!  Note well: They don't accept credit cards (Although I hear a rumor that they secretly do; the minimum is $15 so be sure to bring enough cash!)   They are located right next to the West Side Market so you can just park in the market parking lot, go out to eat, and then shop at the market afterwards!"}
{"text":"Been here various times.. They are so helpful and friendly and the food is affordable and delicious!  The portions could be a bit bigger.. I do leave still feeling hungry at times but I love it anyway, I just get a desert at the west side market!"}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for drinks and 1.5 hrs for food that was not good.  The chicken pad thai was colored bright red and stained my lips and tongue.   Much, much better dining options just steps away."}
{"text":"I have eaten here/gotten take out from them a couple dozen times in the last few years, I wish I lived/worked closer. I adore the egg rolls and the spring rolls, and the beef khmer noodles are my favorite.  Almost everything I have tried has been very tasty, but I have found I am not a fish cake person. Hey, you never know unless you try!"}
{"text":"Not a pho place. You are on your own if you order something else. Very quite and doesn't seem there are many people interested in dinning in?!"}
{"text":"Good prices, excellent Cambodian food."}
{"text":"I think I've found my new favorite asian restaurant. The food is absolutely unique and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm constantly on the lookout for good Asian food. I really can't express how much I enjoy this place as the prices are reasonable and the dishes are unique. You're not going to find this type of food much anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch with my boyfriend and had some delicious pad Thai! The service was fine and atmosphere was mediocre, but food was great. We were here for lunch so didn't drink but I like that it's BYOB, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch periodically. The food is excellent. The decor is very nice, but a little dark. The Hue Beef Soup is delicious, but can be spicy. Warning: cash only."}
{"text":"Best place for gaysians, for real food in Cleveland. Better mee katang than in Providence, loc lac was bomb, beef salad was ok, appetizer platter was so good. Waitress was the best, she was so friendly. Worst place for breakups."}
{"text":"I got take out chicken curry and a rice noodle dish very similar to pad thai.  The curry was more like what would be considered malay curry at Mint Cafe, which is definitely fine with me.   I think the food is better than average. I've had apps and entrees there. The heat level is inconsistent - I've had blisteringly hot and I've had pretty tame heat on the same dish on different occasions.  The service is good, the decor is cool. I'm glad to see the Irish bar and Middle Eastern food stranglehold on W. 25th be broken."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not spectacular.   Lived in Asia and ate in Phnom Penh several times and food does not compare.   Prices are high for food you get.  Lastly service is bad.   We were only ones in restaurant and server did not give us the time of day.  This was our second and last visit.  12/12/17 update - I just received my credit card bill and Phnom Penh increased the amount I authorized on my credit card (appears they took the liberty to give themselves a tip) and charged me more than I specified on my receipt.  I am appealing to my credit card company.  I have never had a merchant do this ever!  I absolutely will NEVER step foot in this establishment again. As such, I dropped my review from two to one star - I would review zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure how this place got so many stars. I usually don't rate restaurants but this one definitely got my attention to start a Yelp account. My husband was very upset about the food and service and I was not pleased either.  My husband and I just moved into Fairview Park and I had a crazy crave for pho at 3pm. Instead of going to the busy downtown area for my usual pho spots, I googled pho places in the area and Phnom Penh came up. I'm usually open to trying new restaurants so I thought why not. And plus, Yelp gave it a 4/5 rating. Pretty good, right?  My first impression? Well, the place on the inside looked beautiful! And when my husband didn't know what to order, the server gave us a book of beautiful pictures of their food. The prices were pretty low as well. This placed looked promising so far, although we did not get our drinks yet until later when we received our food.  My husband asked if there were noodles, meat, and vegetables in the spring rolls. The server said yes so we ordered two of those. Then I went for the large pho ($8, which was a pretty average price for a large pho compared to downtown Cleveland) and my husband ordered the Mi Chha.  My husband wasn't happy when we received the spring rolls. There weren't any meat inside, just little chopped up pieces of shrimp. I wanted to keep an open mind though, hoping my pho would compensate for the less-than-filling spring roll.   I think my husband had enough of this place when I received my bowl of pho. Literally, my pho was like the size of the Maruchan instant ramen noodles in a small bowl. My husband clarified with the server \"this is a large?\" The server said yes. He then asked how the small looked like. She said \"the small is what it looks like in the picture.\" She brought back out her book of pictures and pointed to two different pictures. She said one picture was the large and one picture was the small. Honestly though, the pictures were CLOSE UP of all the foods. With close-up pictures, all dishes looked the same size. I couldn't help but laugh while I saw my husband's eyes fire up. He just said OK and the server left our table.   At this point, my husband didn't even want to eat anymore. He only finished half his plate (which he said tasted like instant noodle stir-fried) while I only took probably two minutes to eat my sad little bowl of the $8 pho. He paid for our food and we left.  Usually I like to give other places a second chance and I do feel bad giving a family business such a bad rating, but the pho was definitely not worth what we paid for. And also, I haven't seen my husband so angry at a restaurant before. I think for now, we'll just stick to our usual spots."}
{"text":"We. Love. This. Place. Really good food. Kind of a cross between Thai, India, Chinese food- Ali though that doesn't do it justice. Our kids who are adventurous eater love it too. We often ask the staff to pick menu items for us; it's a huge menu and hard to narrow down the choices. Simple atmosphere. It great food."}
{"text":"I visit often. The staff and owners are super nice.  The place is spotless.  And the food is delicious.  I like to order the pad thai, beef pho, and bun Khmer."}
{"text":"This may be one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  Whenever we are in town we make time to eat at Phnom Penh because it seems as though you can't go wrong.  I love the variety of noodles available and the spices/sauces are so incredibly delicious.  Also, I love that the spicy meals are actually spicy.  Also perfect for our vegetarian friends who have plenty of options here."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good and one of my favorite restaurants of all time. It's unfortunate that I won't often get to eat here anymore, as I'm no longer in the area.  All of their noodle dishes are amazing, and I really like their house special beef hue soup. The spiciness that they prepare their dishes with really adds flavor, and it's not just \"spiciness for the sake of spiciness\" -- it really enhances everything. That comes hand-in-hand with a warning though: the spiciness levels are far hotter than what you'd see in an Americanized place; a \"medium\" here might be off-the-scale spiciness at a more tame place. If you're adventurous, you can ask them to go off-the-scale here too (\"extra\" or \"dragon\" hot), but I only recommend this if you're very seasoned to spiciness. Just the normal \"hot\" satisfies this happy customer, who normally orders \"15\" on a scale of \"10.\"  Bonus: their spring rolls are also prepared very well, with excellent crisp and stuffing.  If I'm ever in the Cleveland area, I plan to take a special trip to this place."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on a Friday night.  Spending most of our time in Ohio City and being from around the neighborhood we've always wanted to give this place a go and I'll say this right now - not impressed.    I'm not going to talk about the decor or the ambiance - that has nothing to do with my review.  It was strictly a lack of good service and terrible food that weighed in on this review and as much as I wanted to like it, I just couldn't.  We tried the Natin (coconut ground pork w. crispy rice) - not too bad but not something I think I would order again.  For my meal I had the khmer bunn and again, not impressed.  To be frank, the flavors of this dish were not pleasing to my palette and in all honesty, I can't really even remember specific details about what it was I didn't like - it left that little impression on me.  The bf ordered something with beef and asked for hot, and hot he got.  So hot, in fact, that he was having a hard time eating it and this is not a guy who can't handle spicy foods.  The flavor of this dish far surpassed mine but you couldn't enjoy it because the heat was just way too overpowering.  So beware - you want hot, your mouth will get it.   I really want to give this place another shot - I feel like it has a lot of potential and maybe I just need to find that one dish that blows my socks off.  But until I do, I'm stuck at 2 stars.  P.S. on the plus side, this place is BYOB so you can at least wash down your food with some of your favorite adult bevies."}
{"text":"Glad someone knows how to make something hot when you ask for it hot. Great job. The lady at the front desk was extremely kind. Place is very nice inside (though my food was to go) looks recently redone and updated. I'll be back."}
{"text":"An overwhelmingly large menu to put it simply. You must just go with the BAYON. I'm a vegetarian and I can never, NOT get the Bayon. It's mind-blowingly mouthwatering. The tofu is homemade and almost a confit of flavor that just bursts into your mouth with every bite. The MED spiciness is perfect. I have never gotten anything on the menu--I crave the BAYON on a daily basis. One complaint I ahve about this resaturant are the male servers... seriously, what. The. F%#$&k. No personalities, don't want to be there, take no pride in their positions. All the female servers are a pleasure, if you are lucky enough to get the female Cambodian girl, ask her about the names of the dishes, she will give you an awesome history lesson. Super rad."}
{"text":"So very disappointed on our last visit. One person ordered Pad Thai - it was PINK. It did not look appetizing. The person who ordered it tried it, and did not like it. We all had \"tastes\" and agreed this is NOT the flavor of ANY Pad Thai we've ever had. I told the waiter the dish was not to our liking. He said, \"No problem. Can I get you something else?\" We ordered another dish. He offered us the Pad Thai to take home, and I replied we truly didn't care for it and would not be interested in eating it later either.   Check comes - Pad Thai is on the bill as well as the replacement dish. I discreetly went to the waiter and told him the Pad Thai was still on the bill and we were not happy w it. He said there was nothing he could do. I shard my perspective. He called backed to the kitchen. The kitchen responded and he translated: Best we can do is 1/2 off. We serve Pad Thai all the time. No one complains. Nothing is wrong w Pad Thai. If you don't like it, that has nothing to do w the food.   I said OK. I paid my bill in full (after the Pad Thai price was reduced to 1/2.) I did not lower his tip. My tip reflected his good service and the amount of the bill. I realize he was only doing as he was told. He seemed very uncomfortable. I felt bad for the situation he was in. The PRINCIPLE of the matter has left me w a bitter feeling towards Phnom Penh. I just don't know if I'll go back.  Additionally, it is yet another reminder to order the cuisine of the establishment - this is a Cambodian and Vietnamese restaurant, NOT Thai!"}
{"text":"The pho is delicious.  I was very happy today that they were open earlier than their advertised time.  Having a couple of appetizers as well as the pho.  My son and I love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pho I've ever had in my life!  Extremely small portion for $8 and was completely bland.  I asked to return it politely and was treated very rudely."}
{"text":"We went to this place to try some Cambodian and Thai food. The food was okey, but the portion was so small for the price. Although I ordered beef , the food was 75 percent onionn pepper. ...overall a very disappointing experiance."}
{"text":"The nicest owner, with real food made with sincerity and integrity.   They need to start having brown rice though."}
{"text":"If you like Pad Thai then try their #54 series.  I think it's better than Pad Thai.  Order the level Dragon Fire if you are into hotness.  #23 with beef is my most fav dish there.  #94 is good also."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Best Vietnamese Cambodian I've had in Cleveland. Need Hue soup is complex in taste and just wow. Noodle dishes are varied and very tasteful. Service is refreshing and helpful."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...... It's just ok.  I LOVE pho! We were in this part of Cleveland today and I was craving some delicious noodle soup! This place has decent reviews, so we thought we'd give it a try....I wouldn't label this as pho. I'm not 100% sure, but I'd say 95% sure the broth was chicken stock. It was definitely not that distinct pho flavor that you get with every amazing bowl. It also had to of been the absolute smallest bowl of pho I've ever seen in my life! I'm talking small. I left hungry, I've never let a pho restaurant hungry. The \"mini egg rolls\" we're about 2\" long...maybe. So if you're thinking, like me, the typical small spring roll...nope. And I can't tell you 1 thing that was in that \"egg roll\". It was 99% dough.   The smoothie was good. That is all I would say was actually good.  Maybe their other food is good, but don't come here for pho, you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't go to restaurants a lot, let alone make a review. But this one is my favorite. Great restaurant and awesome food. This place has been open for dining since December 2011. The menu has many items so be sure to check out their facebook page, where they have pictures of every food on the menu. The food goes by numbers so under every picture on facebook they have the number that it corresponds to on the menu. Many people I know love this place, since there's not many reviews here yet, I'll post this in hopes it might help. In any case, make sure that you don't get thrown off by the countless food items or unhappy people that have seen ONE thing out of 100. There is bound to be something that suits your needs. Just make sure that you check out their facebook for pictures in case you're wondering how something looks or what it is for the price. I've seen another review here where the person was angry because of the size of their food. Unless you eat 2 bowls of soup every day for lunch or whatever, one bowl should be perfectly fine.  Furthermore, this place has quite a nice atmosphere to it, suitable for any occasion. They do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own. Service is great and they treat you very nice. I enjoy having a meal here on occasion. Very happy with this place. It's probably the only place I feel inclined to coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try in part because of Michael H.'s review and I must say that this restaurant lives up to the hype. It is that good. I had the (S1) Kuy Teav Chha Kreoung Tek Trey Phem with chicken and it was the perfect combination of sweet and salty, and there was enough food to bring a box home. The chopped spring roll on top is the greatest thing ever."}
{"text":"Pro tip: ask for the vegan menu! The spring rolls are excellent, and the noodle dishes, from what I've tried, are great. One of the noodle dishes didn't have mushrooms as advertised, but that's not a big deal. The portion sizes are not huge, but I also have a large appetite."}
{"text":"No idea why this is listed as Thai, because its definitely Cambodian.  Went with a friend last night for the first time since moving back to Cleveland. Huge menu, I didn't even know where to start (which I guess means I'll be back.) I had the veg. spring roll which was pretty good, not mind blowing, and the veg pad thai with tofu.  Damn, is that pad thai orange. The pickled cabbage on top is so good, I could eat a bowl of that alone, but the pad thai itself is good and inexpensive.   Super polite and attentive service, and like i said HUGE menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and service. Pad Thai was fresh and wonderful. Tried my first Cambodian dish and I am in love! Great prices"}
{"text":"I just checked out Phnom Penh with my hubby and a few friends last night - I absolutely loved it! I believe the name of the dish I ordered was Banh Sougnh.. It had rice noodles, chicken, cut up pieces of egg rolls, and a peanutty-coconut milk sauce. I asked for mild, and it had very little spiciness - I might ask for medium next time. I also ordered the jackfruit and coconut blended drink and it was delicious - kind of melon-like, with the sweetness of a banana. Wow! I would definitely go back and take some friends or family. The restaurant is fairly big with some fun southeast asian decorations, and although it's not fancy by any means (and it's totally affordable), it would be a good place to take out-of-towners or to go for an affordable and fun date night."}
{"text":"Went to the one in North Olmsted. Noodle bowls = amazing. Atmosphere = lacking. But the food more than made up for it!"}
{"text":"The food is great...very fresh, fast, and reasonably priced. Not much ambiance, but a clean friendly place with excellent food with awesome flavor."}
{"text":"I've been twice, and both times it's been deserted. I don't understand why-- the service is great (not awkward, even if you are the only table) and so is the food. I've had the Chha Kreoung and Mee Khmer. Both dishes were flavorful and everything you'd expect. Prices are less expensive than average for the area. If you like spicy food, make sure to ask for the spicy; \"medium\" didn't have much of a kick."}
{"text":"So my daughter and I were YELPING our way over to Mexican place when we passed Phnom Penh. I a whim we decide to try it. Passed it s 100 times. Always said it looked interesting. Turns out it was great. I couldn't tell you what authentic Cambodian tastes like. So I can't speak to that. Taste however I know. This was AWESOME! Everything we tried was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What happen to this place?  Been there a few times lately and its getting worst.  The Phnom Penh at West 25th is WAY better.  Minh Ah is also much better.  Service is SUPER slow and they are getting cheaper with the food.  The Pho (#6 on the menu) is pretty much just broth, noodle and overcooked beef, where are all the other ingredients?  Save your money and go to another place or the one on E30th and Superior if you are on the Eastside."}
{"text":"For those of you who love pho, you must try this Cambodian noodle at Phnom Penh. It uses the same noodle but broth is very different. It is a clearer soup simmered with an abundance of pork bones making it very flavorful. You can either order the meal with soup or soup on the side. With soup on the side, noodles are mixed with a soya sauce and it is really good and you'll to taste the original flavor of the broth."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by my last visit. I have a feeling this place is having a hard time competing with the other restaurants for customers. But I would think if that were the case your food would still be spot on!   My table was only 1 of 3 and the service was not good at all. We had to track down our server to order our food as well as later on to get our bill then again for him to take our credit card to pay. The food was also lacking in spice. I used to be able to come here and a 2 or 3 was just the right amount of spice for me and this time I couldn't taste any spiciness. My food also lacked flavor which depresses me because I used to love coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"Same entree was as good as ever.  The drier beef curry was fantastic! (Son's entree)  Celebrating my eldest son's birthday and MLK Day. This place was his top pick. We have raised him well methinks."}
{"text":"We stopped in the 2nd time because we thought the food was pretty good. I was surprised when we were at our table (after we ordered) to hear someone in the kitchen coughing/hacking away in the back. I know its flu season, but if its so bad we can hear it in the dining room, stay home. After 10 mins of coughing in the back we canceled our order and left...not a good way to do business."}
{"text":"Call in your order, park in the back, walk in, grab your food, go home, eat. I really don't know what's not to like. Friendly service, excellent food and great value, all in one. They are the only Vietnamese restaurant in the area open before 3 on the weekends, well worth the extra few minutes it takes to get here compared to my other favorite Vietnamese restaurant close by.  They have all the staples, pho, pad thai, curry, basil fried rice, rice plates and the list goes on and on. So many menu items it's really hard to decide what to order. Good thing is, their prices are low so you can order several items for the cheap. I like everything I have ever had here so much, I could literally eat here everyday. The portions are really large, the food quality is surprisingly to my liking (considering the low pricing).   Heads up, when you say spicy, they really give it to you and their closed Mondays. They are so fast, definitely authentic, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was quite pleased. The menu was a little daunting as I wasn't quite sure what I wanted and wasn't familiar with the cuisine. The mini spring rolls were very tasty although a little overcooked for my taste so I really didn't get the full benefit of the fillings. My chicken Mi Chha was flavorful with crunchy veggies. An adequate portion for lunch. I do wish that there had been a designated lunch menu which might have made the menu less overwhelming. Great clean space and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not sure there is better Vietnamese / Cambodian food in the city.  We usually hit this place as a lunch spot and have never had a bad meal.  My favorite is the Pad Thai (which you can get at whatever \"heat\" level you want), but their noodle bowls are also good.  As an appetizer, be sure not to miss their paper rice rolls...truly outstanding and fresh with a great dipping sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, flavorful, authentic, good service, and family owned. What more do you need?   I got combination soup 17 and it was great. Curry soup my fiancé got was good but mine was better. I posted a picture."}
{"text":"After a star studded review of this place from a co-worker, I popped in for takeout - did the mini spring rolls and the Original Khmer Stirred Pan Noodels with Seafood (54F).  Yes, the menu is that extensive that they just ask for the number/letter reference.  I did order the noodles extra hot with no onions.  I do not have luck with any oriental establishment in northeast Ohio making a dish extra spicy for me - even after I say that I would like it \"Thai hot\" or 11 on a scale of 1 - 10.  Many times I tell them that I can handle the heat and would really like it prepared very, very hot. Almost all times I receive the product with zero heat or spice to it (for me, at least).  Well, my noodle dish came, as requested - no onions and it was extra spicy hot. Fantastic job. The dish was great tasting with a very nice amount of mixed seafood (shrimp, squid and scallops) in the dish.  To me the mini spring rolls are very mini - almost cigarette sized, cut in half - yes, that small.  I will pass on these next time.  However I feel that it is well worth exploring this extensive menu and I will recommend this place to others.  Near the corner of Dover and Lorain, in North Olmsted (right next to the \"Toys are Us\"."}
{"text":"\"Phom Phlegm\"  Went on a weekend.  Service was nice and the lady there was polite and friendly.  The food was good.  It was hard to enjoy because we kept hearing the sound of someone loudly blowing their nose and clearing their throat with that disgusting sound you make before you are about to spit something nasty.  It wasn't an inconsiderate customer.  This sound was coming from the kitchen!  If you are running a restaurant and your employee comes in so sick they have to gross out your customers with that obnoxious sound you should send them home.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"The Loraine Road location  is convenient from  CLE . Everything we tried there was full of flavor. The restaurant translated my request for Mild to Medium spice level as Mild+. It was perfect. We look forward to try this location. In the near future."}
{"text":"The best H Tíu you can find in Montreal. The taste is very close to the street food in Saigon."}
{"text":"Always great, my go to spot for a solo lunch.  I love the House Special Spicey Hue Beef Soup, a Pho-type entree sized soup, though I don't think Cambodians actually call it Pho. Tender slices of beef, delicious noodles.  Not really all that spicey.  There is Sriracha on the table.  I usually add a little of that and some soy sauce.    To go with that I either get the egg rolls, slim and crispy, or the Cambodian Chicken Salad - which I love.  Moist shredded chicken on a bed of finely shredded cabbage and carrots in a sweet, vinegary sauce I could almost drink.  And there has got to be some fish sauce in there.  At $2.65 it's the best side for the money in Cleveland.  The décor is a little stark, although there are some beautiful enormous wood carvings on the walls.  Lighting is always full up, typical of Asian restaurants, and the tables and chairs, well they look like they belong in an office building cafeteria.  Phnom Penh is always sparklingly clean, and the service (I think by the owners) is always very friendly, very attentive, and very fast.    Go!  I'll be the guy sitting alone, staring at his phone (free Wi-Fi) and trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to slurp noodles with chop sticks.  Say hi!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, mostly for the pad thai, but the service has always been good too. My wife loves the spring rolls and their coconut drink, so those things always have her wanting to go back. Last time I was at this location it was cash only, but been to the North Olmsted place more recently and they take credit. I generally don't like most Asian food, but this place is great."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot for eating in or taking out. Reasonably priced with a wide selection and flavorful, authentic food. The woman at the front is very kind and they are quick to order, quick to serve! I love their pad Thai and spring rolls"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Thai spot. Service is great -friendly and helpful. The food is spicy...when they say \"Thai\" spice, they mean it. It's also BYOB which is nice with so many great breweries around. With a shot if you're not looking for anything too fancy or high end."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since the prior location, probably close to 20 years! You can count on great food and service. My personal favorites are Bangh Souhn and the sticky rice. My hubby swears by S1. We are both vegetarian so we love the many options!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan on this restaurant....My husband & I always get the same dish: Chicken Pad Thai & spring rolls.   Lately, this place has not been consistent with their food at all.  There is less & less chicken in the dish.  Sometimes we will order the dish medium & it has no spice at all  & other times it is super hot. Because the customer service level sucks, we decided we will only be ordering take out at this place.  We have been in the restaurant before & they had a play area in the back of the restaurant for one of the waitress's toddler.  You will see the waiters sitting at the table on their ipods or computers eating & not paying attention to their customers.   I have also seen them wearing flip flops--I am not sure but I think this is a health code violation..if it isn't, it should be. When I really think about the place (if you enter through the back, you pass by the kitchen) I don't really know how clean it is which makes me sick to my stomach.  They opened a new one in North Olmsted  that I am willing to try.  Maybe the customer service & food are better than the W 25th location."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The food here is really tasty and super inexpensive for the quality and quanity.  If you'll not be shy then the staff can share their favorite dishes or the most traditional or what other diners rave about.  I have had the pad thai and some other noodle dishes that were good but the item I get most often is a very traditionals Cambodian bowl of noodles and it has a spring roll chopped up on top.  Give them that description and they'll be able to point it out to you.  The menu is huge so take your time and then point to something on the menu and press 'go'!  The environment is very, very basic so don't go there to have a great ambiance or comfy seats to sit and gab with friends or  family.  Oh, and most important is to check out their hours because more than one we've arrived to a closed door.  The other need to know factoid is that this is a cash only operation so to be sure you don't spend the evening washing dishes to earn your meal."}
{"text":"Holy mother of mary, jesus, and any other gods you can think of, the food is hot!! But then, I should have known better than order it extra spicy. My other two dining mates knew better and ordered their food medium. But, being the snob that I am (kidding, I am a very pleasant person in real life, this is all a persona), I had to say \"make mine spicy, extra spicy\".....oh, and they did. I can hear the conversation going on in the kitchen:  Waiter: two mild, one extra spicy.   Chef: Extra spicy? for real? nobody orders regular spicy and this one wants it extra spicy?  Waiter: Yep, the Indian ova there probably thinks he is da sh*t. He thinks he can handle our spices just because he is Indian.   Chef: oh hell no!!  Waiter: Let's show him some Cambodian love, with extra spices  Chef: I've got it covered. Just make sure he doesn't start screaming after the first bite.   Waiter: I've got the fire extinguisher ready    So, our food arrives. I ordered the Taprom: sweet and sour flavored Cambodian dish with fresh mushrooms, onions, scallions, napa, green peppers, in a light lemongrass sauce, and tamarind, with chicken....extra spicy. The dish looked RED. I tells ya, it looked like fire.  And then I took the first bite with some rice. mmmm, tasty. Took few more bites. Mmmm, chomp, chomp...nice....wussies, they were trying to scare me with their spice factor.   That is when the fire hit. First my lips started burning, then my tongue, then my throat, I felt like my insides were on fire. Damn, that felt good!! I haven't felt that good since I ate in the motherland. This is what real heat feels like and I am glad I ordered it. Needless to say, I finished the entire dish. It was incredible.  My friends got the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt. I know, right?!?! Let me explain it to you. It is an exotic flavor, mixture of lime leaves, garlic, turmeric root, galanga root, coconut whip, Mass Rass Prowh (a special vegetable from Asia), and lemon grass; stirred with onion, green or red pepper, chunky chopped roasted peanuts with chicken and served with rice. They ordered it mild...wussies!   That's right people, the food is not only good, it is complicated!!  Let's just say the dish with complicated name was incredible. The flavors blended quite well giving it an indescribable taste. It was phenomenal. The chunky roasted peanuts drizzled on top made it extra special.   Overall, an out-of-this world dining experience in a very unpretentious setting. Love the simple and beautiful decor. Service is impeccable, they came often to check on us. In fact, for a second, our waiter got worried when i started to sweat. I had to assure him I am OK.  One last bonus point: it is BYOB.   Totally worth setting your insides on fire!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, there was only one guy working. I don't mean one waiter, I mean, there was the waiter, who was also the busboy, who was also the chef. I love restaurants like that actually. It feels homey.   I've never had Cambodian food and so we asked the owner to give us some recommendations. He suggested we try the pan fried noodles. We got the pan fried beef noodles, Cambodian spicy. I almost died.   The spice is not the kind of spice that just tickles your mouth. This is the kind of spice that rocks your world and then stays. It's the fact that it stays that really overwhelms your mouth. So I had to get one of their fresh smoothies to help cool down my mouth. I got the guanabana, which I had never had before. I always like to order things that are different and new, but when I don't like them, I tend to hand it over to my boyfriend. I wasn't a huge fan of the guanabana. It is very light, barely sweet, but has this strange after taste. I described it as fishy, but my boyfriend says he couldn't taste it. I guess it's a matter of taste.   Overall, the experience was okay. I liked the food, but the smoothies weren't really my thing. Also, I think because I didn't drink it and my boyfriend did, he ended up getting sick. I don't think it was anything wrong with the food, but the guanabana is some crazy beast. Drink at your own risk.   But despite that, I'd still definitely come back. The food was good. I'll just know what to avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, affordable. The owner, I think, was our server, and he recommended meals according to our preferences. This is a very family-run, dive-type place with an unassuming facade that could easily go unnoticed on trendy W 25th--don't let it! The food is authentic, the service sincere, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing bland food. One dish was sent back because it had no flavor and the waitress argued that we had to pay for it. The lights were off in the right side of the restaurant so it was very dark and awkward. The service was very rushed. My husband loves Cambodian food but he will never go back there"}
{"text":"I have now gone to Phnom Penh Twice. The first time was the most intense dinner of my entire life (explained later) and the second made me realize how wonderful having a resturant this true to its origin is.   I went to Phnom Penh the first time because i love, crave, and miss thai food. Its just a type of favor, spice and type of food that once you eat for an extended period, you miss all the time. So we went. And i did not read the reviews on this site (or i would have know), but i asked for advice and ordered what the very wonderful server suggested (i have never had cambodian food-wanted to try that).  AND because i have now been to several thai rest. in america since i got back, i was a bit arrogent. I know that even at Thai rest. that if you order \"really spicey\" They still don't give you thai medium. So i ordered and said \"make it as spicey as you can\".  HAHAHAHAH- i laugh no because i finaly have regained feeling in my mouth- three months later.  I almost died and was convinced for about an hour that i should be rusted to the hospital and treated for spicy death syndrum.  i ate a total of 3 bites. I was so embarressed, i swore never to return, got a to go bag of my entire meal and left.   Of course i went back. BEACUSE, even under all that spicy, there was something really good about the food, i kenw it. Especially since they know how to ACTUALLY spice their food, they must know how to ACTUALLY cook thai/cambo. Food.  The second time i got the veggie spring rolls (AMAZING) and spicy beef soup (AMAZING AMAZING- An entire meal).  I am SO SO SO happy i have given them another chance and i have SO MUCH MORE FOOD TO TRY!   My husband had a dish that had nuts and peanut sauce over chicken and TONS of veggies. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD!   i love the food and happy with my lesson learned. They have good food, clean environment, and i actually have been to the wood village that the carvings on the wall are from. Its an amazing place.  They hold VERY true to customs and traditions in the cooking."}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like much. But the food is great and the menu has a wide range of delicious dishes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First of all their parking is confusing. Secondly we ordered Pad Thai noodles with chicken and other with shrimp. We didnt like our entrees. There was too much color to the extent my chicken looks all pinkish red. Shrimp was not good either.  Veg spring rolls - very oily Rice paper roll - even though my husband liked it, I didnt.   I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently for a friends birthday. Their menu is huge and greatly confusing. So many dishes were nearly identical except for one or two ingredients. In the end, I honestly had no idea what I actually ordered. The top half was actually quite tasty, but unfortunately everything underneath was not--very bland and the thick translucent noodles turned me off greatly. My husband got the pad Thai and that was actually pretty good. Perhaps if we ever do go there again, I just might get that instead."}
{"text":"I just went with the bf and we liked this Cambodian restaurant! We'll be back to try it again.  What we ordered:  Appetizer - Na-ting (thanks to the yelp reviews). Rice crackers & pork in coconut milk. The sauce was very savory and the flavors were really good.  Amok - Different than the steamed amok that I tried in CA (flavorful steamed catfish & garlic wrapped in bamboo leaves) with catfish, squid, and shrimp in red curry, but I still enjoyed eating it. I think I'll try it a little spicier next time to accentuate the flavor.  Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt (chicken) - green curry that is delicious! This was definitely our favorite.  Notes: - cash only - the menu is very long! - very nice and hospitable owners  - it was really quiet with very few customers on a monday night - can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow!"}
{"text":"By far the WORST restaurant experience of our lives! My mother is in town from FL and loves Cambodian food. I live in OH City so I figured we would try this restaurant. We show up for lunch and are the ONLY customers in the entire place. Immediately I wonder why this place isn't busy being in the heart of W25 during a weekday lunch hour? I ordered spring rolls and chicken sticks as an appetizer, the spring rolls were frozen then deep friend...they tasted like deep fried goldfish food (tasted like the scent). The chicken sticks were boiled fatty chicken dipped in a terrible sauce that tasted like bad lemon juice. We the received our entrée's. We ordered pad thai (chicken), on the entire dish maybe 5-6 small dry pieces of chicken, extremely bland flavor, no vegetables and room temperature. AWFUL! Then I ordered a beef curry lunch...the sauce tasted like a bathroom cleaner and the beef texture was rubbery/fatty (terrible quality meet). I took one bite and pushed the plate aside...It was so bad I couldn't even give the dish the benefit of the doubt for a second tasting.   Our waitress comes over and I very politely explain to her that the dish doesn't taste right and that I would like to try something else. She then tells me \"you can order a new meal but you have to pay for this one, it's right here on the front of the menu that all sales are final and you CANNOT send food back\" ARE YOU KIDDING? That was an immediate red flag on how bad the food is at this place! If your food is so bad that your menu needs disclosures you have no business serving the public food? She then continues to argue with my mother and I. Getting annoyed I give in and say \"fine charge me for the fowl dish you served me...I will try the basil chicken\" Almost 20 minutes later she brings out the meal and basically tosses it at me. At this point I am hesitant to even try it because God knows what happened to my food in that noisy kitchen. I ask for the check...she charged us for all dinners and for every item! We asked for lunches and that clearly didn't happen. I asked her why we were charged for dinners and she told me we asked for them ( we didn't). At that point I just wanted to escape! We paid the check and ran for the door! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This location is currently only offering take-out, but they are serving up the same delicious yumminess as their main location in Ohio City.  The owner did tell me that he has applied with the city to expand into the adjacent store front to provide seating for diners.  Even as a take-out only spot it is still offering up some amazing dishes on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Had time for a quick bite and decided to try here. Handy back entrance from parking lot, friendly host and server, and the food was great! I especially liked the homemade fried tofu, and the pad Thai was delicious! Reasonably priced too. Looking forward to going back the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how good this place is.  The vegetarian options are plentiful (ask for no fish sauce and they will accommodate). I got a noodle dish with tofu -- I forget the name but I think it was S1 -- and it was incredible.  The serving was huge, and the tofu out of this world.  The place isn't much to look at, but the service is extremely friendly and speedy.  For an authentic experience you can't get better than this."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Ohio city possibly Cleveland.  I lived in NYC and had Vietnamese/Cambodian food everywhere.  I'll put this place against any restaurant. Try the extra spicy pad Thai and Thai tea.  The tea is fantastic"}
{"text":"A plain restaurant but it's worthwhile if you want soup. The roast chicken is a good alternative if you're with someone that doesn't want soup. Coffee is still strong even if you refill the filter until the cup is full."}
{"text":"Since moving away from Montreal and even having family members from Ontario try the dry ka tieu (kuy teav, kuy teiv) everyone still talks and raves about how delicious the dish from this establishment is to this day and I have a very large family. Everything from the savoury broth to the Chinese fried donuts on the side, I'm drooling typing this review! I now reside in Ontario and have not found anything close to this not even in Toronto's Chinatown! Everything has been a sad disappointment, mediocre copy with a pho broth. As a ex inhabitant of the city with my grandma still residing around cote des neige area this place is a must try if you love South East Asian cooking specifically Khmer food. If I'm in Montreal I make sure this is a priority stop along with the big orange and dic anns. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The server I had here was horrible. Really. I went here for lunch with a party of 6. Every single things took forever. And he wasn't even trying. He spoke in a very monotone voice and never brought us anything we didn't have to go get him and ask for. The food was pretty good but still all of us left talking about what was up with the service and it's hard to enjoy your meal when you don't have anything to drink and there are plates crowding the table that he never took away."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite local restaurants. I've never had anything I didn't enjoy and I find everything very reasonable. The North Olmsted location is conveniently close to where I live and though getting to the parking lot is a little tricky, it's worth it. I especially enjoy the A4 appetizer and the hue beef. Or pad Thai or Khmer bun or the seafood soup. I really can't go wrong with the menu."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that in a deserted street at 4 pm in Cleveland, OH Susan N. and I would find the best Cambodian food we've ever had.  I'm a huge fan of South East Asian cuisine - it's my favorite \"foreign\" food. The blend of sweet, spicy, tangy and salt seem to pop in this region's cuisine, naturally each area focusing on one of the four more than another.  In any case, we were really hungry since we didn't eat anything other than some toast before driving down here from Niagara Falls, so hunger might have spiced our dish a little more flavorful. But I think not.  We ordered the Salad Phnom Penh to start, and it was light, fresh and flavorful. Just the right thing to whet our already straining appetites. We then decided to share the Banh Sougnh with chicken and the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt (with chicken). Needless to say we ate everything, only speaking to pass off one bowl of  food to another.   The waiter came by to ask us if everything was good and the query died on his lips when he saw the nearly empty bowls of noodles, chicken and Cambodian goodness.  The above coupled with Thai Iced Coffee was one of the best meals I had on this trip and the best Cambodian I've ever had. So if you come here, I suggest you be adventurous and try the Cambodian fare versus the Vietnamese - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have always been nervous to go in here but saw it featured in the Cleveland Hopkins magazine and had to try it.  Loved the Jasmine tea and tried one of the \"stir fry\" (very American here) type of dishes and it was excellent!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow - been months since I've tried Phnom Penh. Why didn't I review it when it was fresh in my mind?  I remember it being quite tasty. Service good for a quick lunch. Will have to go back."}
{"text":"I've driven past the North Olmsted location a thousand times and had always been curious about it. I finally gave it a try today and wish I would've tried it sooner!  Parking is in the back. The driveway is a little confusing. It's not the lot to the carwash, but the lot directly next to the carwash. It's a single-lane entrance / exit and easy to miss.   I ordered carryout for 3 people. We got # 54a, 68, and 94. We all agreed that it was really good! Mine was #94 with the medium level of spiciness. I was expecting it would be too mild, but it turned out to be perfect level of spiciness. My fiance really liked mine and kept stealing bites. My son said his #68 was really good, but a little on the salty side. #54a was a smaller serving; it might have been the lunch size. Overall, everything was better than expected and I'll definitely go back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I think Cuisine du Cambodge has a slight edge on this place as far as food quality is concerned, but my dinner tonight was very good and probably worthy of an additional half star. The menu here is impressive in its size, and I appreciated that everything was explained well, as I'm not  overly familiar with Cambodian food. Doug and I shared a couple of entrees, the bahn soughn, which consists of round noodles tossed in light-as-air whipped coconut milk with fresh veggies (cuke, basil, sprouts and scallions), and topped with meat of your choice, spring rolls and chopped peanuts. I like this dish. The flavors are pleasing, if quite mild, and the consistency difference between the soft noodles, the spring rolls, the fresh veggies and the coconut milk keeps it interesting. We also ordered cha kreoung, which had considerably more flavor than the bahn, with lots of lemongrass, galanga and lime leaves keeping it zippy. We asked for it medium spicy, which was the perfect amount of heat. Overall, very good, but I've had both dishes at Cuisine du Cambodge and thought they were better there."}
{"text":"Had the spicy pad Thai, one of the best I've had in my whole life. If you want a quick and cheap lunch that's also super good I definitely recommend stopping in, their menu is gigantic!"}
{"text":"So I've been getting take out from this place ever since they opened the North Olmsted branch. I never reviewed because I kept thinking I'll wait for the day I dine in so that I can have a more comprehensive review. Today, as I went to pick up yet another take out meal, I realized I'll probably never dine in. Nothing personal against the place, it is just that it is only 5 min away from me, and so I'd rather pick up and enjoy at home on a sofa in my PJs :).   So what's good? Chha Kreoung and Khmer Bunn are my staples. They're both fantastic and are different styles thus providing good variety. I love the flavor and style of Chha Kreoung and the crunch of the Khmer Bunn (the broken spring rolls in the dish is a lovely addition).   I once ordered Bunn Ga Xao by mistake when I meant to get the Khmer Bunn (was in a hurry and didn't pay attention...the names are foreign to me!). I like my food spicy and full of flavor and the Bunn Ga Xao failed in both those aspects...it is rather bland, dry and apparently is a dish they cannot spice up for you (they will provide a hot sauce on the side instead if you ask, but that sauce wasn't good enough to liven up this dish). That said, the Bunn Ga Xao is probably perfect for those that are new to ethnic cuisine (as in if this is the first time you're eating something that isn't served on a bun with fries on the side).   I also find the place to be rather affordable. So since it is the only Cambodian place in the area (assuming you don't want to make the trip to the lovely Cambodge) and it is spectacularly close to me.....I can't get enough of the place! Seriously, never been disappointed, and I'm pretty critical of my food. My only complaint, if I had to make one, would be the parking situation is annoying. I never try to park in the tiny lot behind the restaurant. It is one small lane for both entering and exiting and is an accident waiting to happen! So I always park in the back of the Toys R Us parking lot and make the not so lady like jump over the hedge to get to the back door of the restaurant (you want to use the back door if you are doing takeout).  For those wanting to dine in, I've never had the experience - but from what I observe while waiting in the lobby, they desperately need a higher dine in business. The ambience is nothing to rave out, the tables have plastic covers - hopefully as their business improves, they can make better interior improvements.   Love this place, GO GET SOME DELISH FOOD RIGHT NOW!!!"}
{"text":"OK food, fair service. Empty at lunchtime is a red flag."}
{"text":"This place is SO delicious. I love the pan fried noodle and spring rolls. Craving some right now. Really great service every time."}
{"text":"I usually like to try new dishes when I make a return visit to a restaurant, but I haven't done that at Phnom Penh - I order the cambodian chicken salad everytime (yes, yes, believe it or not its a salad of chicken + raw vegetables without globs of mayo).  It's light, refreshing, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. Not much ambiance and the service is pretty mediocre, but I don't really mind because the food is great. There are a ton of options, some of them seem really similar save for a few ingredients, but its better to haveto many options than not enough.  I got the Chicken Lemongrass for lunch which was served over steamed rice, medium+ spiciness. It was delicious. I would eat that at least once a week if I could. The spice level was perfect. The lunch portion was a pretty god size, enough for me to finish but be full.  I'm looking forward to going again and trying some of the other offerings. I heard is BYOB so I'm definitely going to consider bringing some beer or wine along with me."}
{"text":"Twice I went here with family, twice we basically asked the owner to order our food for us, we took all of her recommendations, twice we were blown away.  Everything was delicious.  There wasn't a single dish served either time that someone didn't love.  I've been to many Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Indian restaurants and what we had here tasted totally unique to me.  It was like the feeling the first time I ate at a good Indian restaurant and the tastes were so far outside my typical palette, everything tasted \"out of this world\".  That's how I feel about Phnom Penh right now.  Maybe that will wear off as I get more accustomed to Cambodian food, maybe we were getting spoiled and unknowingly eating the choicest items from the menu, but I fully intend on going back as often as possible to find out."}
{"text":"Disappointing, lacking. Had the beef pho and it tasted like chicken broth with lemon grass and the beef was tough. It's a good thing my wife still has her own teeth because the fish cakes were tough. The only good item out of 4 orders with apps was the spring rolls."}
{"text":"My understanding was that this restaurant was originally owned by the same people who used to own Cuisine du Cambodge, which has since splintered off on its own.  The menu is VERY similar, even to the numbers associated with the entrées, so I think this is probably the case.  Throughout most of the latter nineties, I'd heard this place was take-out only, so we never tried it.  But earlier this month we were passing by and it certainly looked like a full-service place, so we gave it a try.  We're happy we did.  The decor is fresh and the layout of the place relaxed.  The interior is actually quite large, so you're not bumping elbows with people at the next table over.  There's the obligatory Asian ting ting music, which either adds to the experience or drives you nuts, depending on who you are.  The service was excellent, as attentive as you'd want without anything more.  All three times we've been here the restaurant was basically empty, however.  Twice at dinnertime during the week, once on a weekend, late afternoon.  The food is outstanding.  The Asian Basil Fried Rice (with your choice of meat) is perfect AND they were willing to make it as spicy as I wanted, something I always struggle with here in Cleveland.    For those who, like me, prefer things ridiculously hot, there seem to be some 'code words' required at this establishment.  \"Thai hot\" is the top of the 'normal' curve, but then there's \"Extra hot\" and finally \"Dragon hot\".  I got Dragon hot my first time in, and it was everything I could've wanted (for calibration, I can actually eat a Trinidad scorpion pepper raw.  I pay for it, but I can do it).   Most places, when I ask for maximum heat, I get food with all the zip of Dentyne gum.  Phnom Penh delivers.  And best of all, the #8 soup.  Long a favorite of ours at Cuisine du Cambodge, in recent months the flavor has changed for the worse, which was HUGELY disappointing to us.  The waitress at Cuisine du Cambodge told us the local Asian groceries stopped carrying a vital ingredient and that's why the flavor changed.  Well, apparently Phnom Penh knows where to get that ingredient.  It's AWESOME here.  Exactly like we remembered it. This soup is SO GOOD, with a flavor that defies description, and it's what keeps bringing us back.  We'll be driving down the road and then a craving for that flavor strikes us and the car seems to drive itself right to the restaurant...  So those are the plusses.  The minuses?  Pretty minor, really.  The parking is behind the building and, while plentiful, is difficult to get to from Lorain, which is extremely busy here.  And getting out can be a real nightmare if you're trying to go east on Lorain.  The prices are high compared to Cuisine du Cambodge, and the portions smaller.  We generally get two meals out of an entrée, but there's none of that here.  On the other hand, you *could* look at this as a plus....at Cuisine du Cambodge, we always have to rely on our own self-restraint not to wolf down the entire meal, while here it's guilt-free eating, as long as you don't mind the lack of frugality."}
{"text":"I agree with Ryan's review -\"Put it in your mouth!\"...pretty much sums Phnom Penh up. Best Cambodian- good & CHEAP! I think its still cash only... which stinks sometimes... But its BYOB. Clean, and right next to the West Side Market."}
{"text":"Second time back and still amazing!  The basil fried rice is great but don't get it unless you like to feel the burn!  Special Bun number 24 is great and so is the kmer noodles!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner with a friend before hitting up the night scene in Ohio city. Despite being one of the few seated tables at the restaurant, it took a good fifteen minutes or so before we were approached by a waitress. Although once we did manage to order and have our food served (which did not take as long); the experience was much better. The pad thai I ordered was fairly good, but I have a tremendously high bar for Asian cuisine in Cleveland after encountering so many good Asian restaurants in the city and surrounding suburbs. That being said, I felt that there were a few other places I would rather go to for something similar, but the location of this restaurant is a bit of an advantage."}
{"text":"I only came back here because the Cambodian place down the street has closed. That may be one of the saddest thing to have happened to Cleveland. So it is with bittersweet emotion that i write this update.  One day R and I were mourning the passing of the other Cambodian restaurant while we were deciding what to have for lunch. I mentioned, oh isn't there that other restaurant still? So off we went the Phnom Penh. I still don't know how to pronounce the P's in Thai. I guess I'll ask them next I go.  I got the vegetable tofu curry noodle soup, and R got the original khmer stirred pan noodles with pork. Omg delicious! So much flavor, so much tofu. Fresh vegetables. The spicy is SPICY!  We will certainly be back here quite a bit now.  I will say though, they really need to update their interior and their lighting situation. It's really hard overhead lighting and not a cozy dinner date spot. You're on W 25! Get your act together, make some investments, and you could have some serious business."}
{"text":"Phnom Penh is honestly as good as it gets. I have tried MANY things on the menu and have loved every one of them. I've had everything from the vegetarian egg rolls to the pho to stirred pan noodles (number 54D which is my FAVORITE). This place remains one of my go to places and it will stay that way!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. As we drove by, I noticed that the neon \"Open\" sign outside was not lit. Had to call to verify if the restaurant was in fact open for business.  As we entered, we saw that the restaurant was dark and completely empty of patrons. We were directed to a table and handed menus. We ordered relatively quickly because the menu features pretty standard fare.  Overall: Staff was polite although service was minimal (as expected). Prices were reasonable, and the food (Mee Khmer; Fried Tofu; Pad Thai) was decent. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap alternative to the pricey beer places in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor is funny, cafeteria like tables and chairs, with some asian flair. I love the little guy outside by the sign. The food was exactly what I wanted! Spicy and perfect.  The spring rolls were tasty, very fresh and the sauce they came with was great.   I went on a rainy day, had a glass of wine(byob) with some spicy food and a funny boy before we headed to the airport for what ended up being quite a journey.   My narcissistic self was a bit distracted by the whole mirror wall, but well, I guess that is my issue.."}
{"text":"I cannot say I am a Cambodian food aficionado. In fact, until I ate here, I hadn't given it a second thought! I had passed this location hundreds of times over the years. Something about the idea of trying Cambodian food seemed intimidating. All I could picture was some fat dude half dressed acting as the Cambodian bouncer forcing me to eat cow eyes or something.  Dude, nothing could be further from the truth. The small little smiley Asian lady at the front counter was gracious and willing to help a clueless white dude. I also saw not a single cow eye on the menu. But to be fair, I can't pronounce anything on the menu....  I couldn't even tell you the name of what we got. But it was a fantastic rice noodle dish with chicken and veggies. The flavor? It was like Thai flavors married Indian flavors and had a Cambodian child. Flavors of curry, peanut, cilantro and garlic all came together for an amazing dish.   The spring rolls we ate were super fresh, had an interesting texture and came with this super sweet, yet tangy, dipping sauce. A rice wrapped veggie plethora of goodness I call them! The rice wrap was slightly chewy, but in a good way!   A simple bowl of beef Pho is something else we ordered. Fantastic flavor and literally piping hot! It took about 30 minutes to be able to eat that bad boy.   Overall, I was really pleased with the experience. Now that I know what I am getting into, I will come back with an open mind and some patience to read the menu."}
{"text":"We loved the food here: it reminded us of our time in Cambodia. I had the Bayon vegetable curry, which was crisp and delicious. I ordered it \"Medium,\" which was only a little spicy, in my opinion. My husband had the rice paper spring rolls and the seafood/chicken/rice soup. Everything was fresh, and the service was friendly. We would return!"}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy my most recent meal at Phnom Penh.  We ordered the Nating to start with folowed by the S1 dish with chicken (vermicelli noodles, chicken onions, lemon grass) and the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt seafood green curry thing that everyone else raves about in their reviews.  To start the Nating was really salty, nothing special. Just a bunch of minced pork in salty tomato broth with the rice crackers.   As for the entrees they were average.  Again, very salty.  Both tasted very similar.  The chicken in the S1 had a strange taste to it.  Almost kind of burnt, or gamey, or old? I\"m not sure, but it was very unappetizing.    After this experience, I'm not really that interested in going back.  I'm sure there are some good dishes somewhere in the menu (the menu is huge) but the dishes I tried were very mediocure and overpriced.  I think giving 2 stars is a little to harsh, but I don't really consider this place \"A-OK\" either."}
{"text":"This far west side location opened around summer on 2011 initially offering only carry-out.  Last month they opened a dining space as well.  Now this location of Phnom Penh can be dubbed a full service restaurant.   The food quality, preparation is at par with their W25th St location.  Their menu is just as expansive offering a wide variety of Vietnamese and Cambodian dishes.  If you have not been to Phnom Penh before, keep in mind it is not a Chinese joint.  However, the far east cuisine it offers is a must try for any new patrons and repeat try for others.  They offer Noodle Soup Dishes, Rice Dishes, Rice Noodle Dishes, as well as variety of Appetizers and Dessert.  The quantity of each dish is very generous and I always find the amount suitable for more than one person.  Using variety of spice, aromatic mixes, Phnom Penh always manages to produce delicious tasting curries, broth, and taste in their items.  My favorite here are their numerous Noodle Soup Dishes of beef, vegetables, seafood, pork and any combination and you can also customize the heat of the dish.  I always appreciate their menu using the traditional names for dishes and explaining in a simple fashion what's in the item.  Every time I order an item from their menu, I find myself learning a new name of a dish.  As this location gets started with dining in,  they have some room to grow around table-side service.  They still seem a little in disarray around order placement and getting everything just right while balancing accurate serving of the right dishes to the right tables.  All of these are easily resolved and I'm sure over time they will get the table side service rolling smoothly."}
{"text":"Quick and pretty good Asian dishes here. Had several of their pad thai and fried rice variations. Dishes are fairly inexpensive and portions are just right for one meal. The flavors in their dishes are familiar but it is a bit more spicy than other places. The spiciness definitely lingers longer here. Mild is what I've stuck with here and I love spicy foods. Anyhow, the dishes that I've had so far were all \"red\". It looks a bit unappealing since its so \"bright\" but once you start eating you really forget about its color... maybe there's an option for no food coloring?"}
{"text":"I should have left when I read \"food is nonreturnable\" on the menu. Silly me, I took that to mean the restaurant would not take something back if the customer ordered it to spicy.  I didn't realize it meant if the waitress brought you the wrong dish she wouldn't take it back! I ordered a rice dish for my son. She brought out some type of chicken broccoli & what might have been eggplant smothered in brown spicy sauce. When I said this was not what I ordered she argued with me that it was. She never did say what it was. The dish was nonreturnable, but I could place another order for something else if I wanted. Why should I be expected to pay for a dish I did not order?!?  The Pad Thai that I received tasted more like over cooked linguini with ketchup. Someone else at the table ordered the same thing, but it tasted completely different. Still bad, but at least edible. When I 1st asked she said it was the same. A few minutes later she said the cook made mine with no spices. Again, not how I ordered it. Once again the dish was nonreturnable. At least this time, the cook offered to throw some spice on top. Really? I understand a restaurant shouldn't be held responsible if you order a dish extra spicy & don't like spice, but if the food brought out is not what was ordered it should be replaced for the correct one! Any decent place would unordered uneaten food off the bill!"}
{"text":"Phnom Penh is probably Côtes-des-Neiges' best kept secret and has been open for over 20 years. Having lived in Toronto and Seattle, I make a point to come to Phnom Penh anytime I'm back in Montreal, haven't found any other restaurant like it in other cities!   The go-to for me is definitely the white noodle Phnom Penh soup served as 'kho', which is served with noodles and broth separate with some great garnishes and sauce on the noodles. It's delicious! Coupled with fried chinese bread to dip in the broth, you're in for a treat, get the spring rolls if you're real hungry as well, they're excellent.   One bonus is that despite their restricted hours, they're usually always open on holidays, I've gone numerous times for lunch on Christmas eves and thanksgivings. Oh, and make sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  I've been to almost all the Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland and some Cambodian ones too. Not to mention that I've eaten Khmer food in Cambodia.  This place, which bills itself as a Cambodian and Vietnamese restaurant does not deliver on either point.    So, I got there hungry which usually bodes well for a restaurant. Well, not in this case.  The pho bowl I ordered was so tiny that I sucked it down in one second and had to order another one.  Unfortunately, with the second bowl, I wasn't quite as hungry and therefore took the time to actually look at my food.  I was not impressed by what I found;  meat was limp, gray, and tasted old.  I had a napkin covering mouth moment....you know what i mean?  My husband also was not impressed with his bun.  I also ordered a Cambodian salad and it was mediocore.  I didn't order other Khmer dishes on the menu, and perhaps they do better at those (Judging by the music, and the conversation, I suspect the people who run the restaurant are ethnic Khmer).  In any case, I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Eating at Phnom Penh was a delicious and wonderful experience. Unless you're familiar with Cambodian food, you'll find yourself googling their various offerings. All the items we selected, perfect."}
{"text":"I'm always searching and go everywhere to try all kinds of Asian food. I must say this place is absolutely one of the best. Not many people know about this place but if you really want to enjoy real Cambodian/Vietnamese food, this place is it!! The server Daniel was so nice and friendly. He picked perfect food for us since I had no idea what to order. Go there and be surprised!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place the moment the food arrived. The soup was so flavorful. The fried dough just makes it better. Fresh and cold soursop drink!"}
{"text":"I don't know if the other people reviewing this place have ever had authentic Cambodian/Vietnams food but this is as real as it gets. I recommend them to everyone, food is amazing, selection is large, and the pricing is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Cuisine du Cambodge in Cleveland and finally decided to try Phnom Penh. It was pretty good, but not as good as Cambodge. The food was tasty, but portions were quite a bit smaller. I thought all of the vegetables were fresh and the service was great too. Would definitely recommend for a great meal in North Olmsted where it's mostly chains. This place is solid and authentic."}
{"text":"The meals were good but on the fairly small side. We were favorites and regulars of Cusine Du Cambodge and when it closed we were looking for a similar place. The pad thai was similar but was lacking a few key ingredients that I prefer in my pad Thai, none the less its not bad. I would suggest if you like us are looking for a similar establishment to Cusine du Cambodge. Still sad its gone!"}
{"text":"Please do yourselves a favor--a serious one.   Go to Phnom Pehn and order yourself some Original Khmer Stirred Pan Noodle, spicy with chicken. Yesssss. Well, I mean I guess you don't have to order it spicy if you don't want to. It's like their Pad Thai but way better, with more veggies and less redness (meaning it's not flaming red, which was always a little off-putting to me for some reason.)   And we almost always forget to bring a sipper with us, since it is BYOB. Next time I refuse to forget. And lets be real here--we all know that I'll be back soon. Too soon.   WARNING: When you order your dish \"hot,\" please expect hot. It's varied at times but has always been pretty seriously spicy. Just another thing I love about PP!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Happy Cow while looking for more vegan-friendly restaurants in the Tremont and Ohio City area. I felt like I had been to every place, but I can't believe I missed this one for so long!  I asked the server what he would recommend for vegans and he named two dishes right away. We both loved the two dishes we had ordered to share. They were flavorful and not too salty.  The proportions, quality, and price combined made for a solid value we were beyond happy to pay for how full and satisfied we were upon leaving. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot recall service that was this bad. The young man that waited on my family was on his cell phone the entire time we were there.  He was upset that we wanted to sit away from a large noisy table and never changed his attitude while we were there. TERRIBLE SERVICE!  The food was average at best.  The Pad Thai was flavorless and limp and other three dishes unremarkable/unmemorable.  There are better (much better) options for Asian food near Ohio City.  Such a fall from grace...when the namesake restaurant was on Madison, it was the best Asian food in Cleveland.  It moved to w130 and was still great, then a change of owners and now location and Phnom Penh has hit the bottom.  Do not waste you time, money or expectations...avoid"}
{"text":"My gf got sick from the mixed seafood. I thought I'd give this another chance because I do have good memories of eating here as a kid.  I had a chicken and noodles dish. You know that flavor of a really good bite of chicken say, from like a nice chicken breast? On the contrary, how about that rubbery, disgusting, chicken from a can chicken taste? That's the flavor I was getting from the chicken in their stir fry. It was pretty much unbearable, I had to mask it with siracha sauce to no avail.   I think the Phnom Penh experience is over for me guys."}
{"text":"Phnom Penh struck me as still more of a take-out place, but the decor in the dining room is decent enough, and the well-spaced tables (11 four-seat tables and 2 six-seat tables by the front) are basic but clean and relatively new.  Getting a nice pair of plastic chopsticks was a plus.  The food was below expectations, particularly for the price paid.  My spring roll was very dry on the inside and the accompanying sauce did nothing to make it any better.  For an entree, I went with the Mee Khmer with the assorted seafood  from the \"Cambodian Specials\" menu.  Nothing about the dish stood out from ordinary take-out fare, and I was disappointed with the amount of seafood included for a $15 plate of noodles.  There were a couple good-sized shrimp but then only slivers of imitation crab and squid and pea-sized pieces of scallops.  Service is minimal, due primarily to the fact that one guy does everything in the restaurant besides the cooking (covering tables, manning the phones, and handling take-out pickups).  Not that it was crowded--only two tables were occupied the entire time (including my table)--but things ended up getting dragged out."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was little.... Still one of the best bowl of noodles and brings back all the good childhood memories. I always get the dry Hu Tieu and Chinese donuts to dip in the soup that on the side. Everytime we are in Montreal we must come here at least once."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness! Prayers of thanks to the rice noodle god and his sidekick the eggroll! This will probably be my Asian (Cambodian and Vietnamese) take-out place going forward. I stopped in one afternoon for take-out (don't judge, y'all know by now I'm single and only get through life by comforting myself with a plate of food I didn't have to cook myself), and was greeted by this nice smiley-faced lady behind the counter. She showed me this amazing book filled with pictures of every dish they have! Ahhh I love that! Sometimes I go into a place and I have no idea what the heck something is so the pictures really helped in picking out what to eat.   I went with the... *A5 for $11.99 which is several different kinds of rolls: 2 Spring Rolls, 2 Egg Rolls, 2 Rice Paper Rolls, and 5 Mini Spring rolls. The mini rolls were my favorite, nice and crunchy. *88 for $9.99 which is Banh Sougnh: \"fresh round rice noodles, lettuce, cucumber, bean sprouts, home-made whipped coconut milk, scallions, topped with chopped spring rolls, Asian basil, ground peanuts and stirred lemon grass with our special sauce.\"To me it was like a really tasty curry with noodles.  *98 for $10.98 which is Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt: \"An exotic flavor, mixture of lime leaves, garlic, turmeric root, galanga root, coconut whip, Ma Rass Prowh (special vegetables from Asia) aromatic and fresh lemon grass. Stirred with onion, green or red pepper, chunky chopped roasted peanut with steamed rice and a choice of meat.\" This was like a typical rice dish amped up a couple notches.   For both entrees I got the combination meat (chicken, shrimp, and pork) and asked for mild spiciness. I liked #88 the best, but #98 was still pretty tasty and I am excited to go home and eat it for dinner tonight. Portion sizes are pretty generous/typical of Asian take-out so I got several meals out of my order. I would definitely recommend!   Only downside is that if you are inside for too long your clothes are going to have this smokey/greasy smell to them."}
{"text":"This place has returned to its former glory - please enjoy! The Cambodian food is amazing. Dishes 82 - 98 are truly sublime, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just amazing service. The rice paper rolls are great and the pat thai and thy ice tea and fried tofu delish the red sauce.is spicy but delish omg soooo good"}
{"text":"I ordered the Phnom Penh noodles and it was delicious!!! I live an hour away so I also ordered the salaw majew kroeung to go (for dinner).   I am definitely going to come back! If I could I would come back every day. Unfortunately, it might just be once a week.   Thank you for having a Cambodian restaurant in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday evening. It wasn't crowded at all. We were seated at a clean, comfortable table right away. Service was a little slow but the waitress, who spoke pretty good English, was very nice and helpful with suggestions. The bathroom was clean. Food was pretty good. Not very expensive. Most dinners ran around $9-$12. It was a nice experience but it didn't blow me away by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem right by the west side market.  The house special salad is incredible, the beef dish was light and flavorful, and the pad Thai is very unique.  Cambodian flavored fun and amazing.  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Phnom Penh, maybe it was the glowing reviews from other Yelpers or my partner's extremely enthusiastic recommendation, but I expected more from you.   First of all, we came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was EMPTY. There were tumbleweeds. It was apparently empty enough that the management only felt that the (already dim) lights had to be on for only 1/3 of the dining room. We squinted to read the menu and squinted some more to see each other and our food. The server was quiet and disinterested, which I understand; seeing as how there were only maybe 3 other occupied tables. Before we even had a bite of food, it was shaping up to be a not-so-good experience.   I love that they allow you to pick how spicy you want your meal! My partner comes here on her lunch break occasionally and gets pad thai with medium spiciness, so I felt safe ordering that. It came out bright red, and she said that she'd never seen it that colour before. I don't know if they were having an off day or the waiter took our order wrong, but it was definitely NOT medium spiciness. We only got through maybe a quarter of the pad thai before boxing it up. Which I enthusiastically gobbled up the next morning for breakfast, while my taste buds were still a little singed and sleepy. Despite the spiciness, the pad thai was excellent and very authentic.  Anyways, the food really was almost really good, but I left feeling very underwhelmed. If I ever do return, it'll be for takeout."}
{"text":"There's a good reason this place has been around for over 30 years on an absolutely desolate stretch of road at the corner of Cote-des-Neiges and Jean-Talon . . . it's DELICIOUS.  Phnom Penh serves up the best Cambodian soup in town. The restaurant is the definition of No Frills, but that makes it even more special.   Cash Only, Lunch Only - so go for a bike ride on a nice day or catch the 165 Bus and try a bowl of their classic soup."}
{"text":"Start off with the Salad Phnom Penh, get it spicy to set the stage for the next course, then order the Won Ton Soup to entice your entree selection!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Very few places still make their extra spicy well, extra spicy. Quality was great but they lose a star because their portions are smaller than competition and prices are higher.  There were a couple of interesting additions to their dishes I hadn't seen anywhere else. The bright red color of their Pad Thai with purple pickled cabbage was different. Green beans and corn in the chicken fried rice was also new to me but both worked well."}
{"text":"One star due to the fact the fish cakes were good. Everything else was just garbage.   The spicy soup. Just noodles and oil with a little bit of beef. This place sucks.  Got the 13 dollar dish that has only meat and seafood. It was like an appetizer portion. If I wasn't with my friend who owns a restaurant I would have sent it back.  Just a plain rip off.    The spring roll was just garbage. I asked for meat or shrimp, and they said no problem. Not, epic fail.  I know what tastes good.There are a bunch of  hipsters who say this place is great, I think they are  smoking crack. This place is owned by a bunch of cheap people who want to load you up on the cheap starches.   Do not order any dish above 7 dollars or you will just get screwed. These people are so cheap. I am embarrassed I brought my fiend who owns a successful Asian  restaurant here.   I have eaten a lot of ethic food do to the 7 yrs I spent in the business.  I got 2 free authentic meals a day.  Korean, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, from 18 to 27 years of age with stints of living in Mexico. I know my shit and can cook too.  This place garbage for serious foodies.  The food here as always been average, my 50 dollar bill for 2 people represented culinary garbage.  I hate to dis a mom and pop place but this was just bad food, no protein, and just a crappy experience and left with 50$ less in my pocket for one sub par lunch.  Bah humbug!"}
{"text":"Poor service, food was average at best. Ordered the Cambodian crepe and it was COLD! Will not go back, there are too many other choices"}
{"text":"We are going on 4 visits now to this wonderful little gem.  The ingredients always taste fresh.  S1 (under Cambodian specials) is the best and a safe bet for new diners.  The house salad is amazing and not what you expect with dressing that has no oil and is addicting.  The pad Thai was a little bit of a let down so don't be afraid to branch out.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but it is always spacious and usually only one or two other tables dining making it a fun date night adventure.  Parking is limited behind the building and you may have to go around the block to get into it.  They have TV screens running pictures of various dishes that help you choose.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of dining experience. Be sure to check their days and hours before you go."}
{"text":"I so wish there was a Cambodian restaurant in Cincinnati.  I didn't know what I was missing until a Cleveland friend suggested we meet here when I came to town.  I've only had one dish, and I don't even remember what it was called, but it was memorably good!  After eating here, I explained the food as a cross between Thai and Vietnamese - which I thought of before I thought of the geography, which makes perfect sense.  I can't find a menu for Phnom Penh online, but the dish had vermicelli noodles and chopped spring rolls and cucumbers and something akin to nuoc cham to pour on top.  My friend and I both ordered the same thing with beef and spicy, and it was just packed with flavor and texture.  The location is good - in a nice strip near the West Side Market, and it has a nice feel on the inside.  There is plenty of space, yet its well decorated and feels quite comfortable.  Hopefully I can update this at some point in the future when I've had a chance to read the menu again, write down some of the names, and most importantly - try more of the food!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing prices! Had multiple vegetarian entrees and appetizers here and have never been disappointed. The service has also always been fast and very friendly. Be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Just walked down the street to try Phnom Penh for the first time, and I'm already thinking about walking back down there to order more!!  It is definitely vegetarian and vegan friendly, just ask the standard questions and all will be good.  There are literally over 100 items on the menu, which is overwhelming but gives me over 100 reasons to go back!  I tried Chha Kreoung with vegetables and fried tofu and chose \"hot\" for level of spiciness. It's certainly spicy!! I can just imagine how wonderful that will be on some cold, snowy winter day. Anyway, it's spicy, but I love spice.  Although it is spicy, there's definitely a lot of other flavors going on in there. The description for this dish: \"an exotic flavor, mixture of lime leaves, garlic, turmeric root, galanga root and lemon grass... stirred with onion, green or red pepper, chunky chopped roasted peanuts with steamed rice.\"  I had hoped I would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but I'm beginning to doubt that!  P.S. They *do* take credit cards for orders $15 and up (although mine was $10 they still took my card) even though the menus say no credit cards."}
{"text":"Wow- this place had great food. I'm from California and we have dozens of Vietnamese restaurants in our area and this place tops them all. Fresh and interesting flavors, house special beef pho and the chicken Cambodian crepes where fantastic.  Service was good and fast.  Hidden Gem."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and it's like a roller coaster.  The first time I ate here with my wife it wasn't to bad as we ordered the pad thai with medium spice and it was fine. went there today and it was crazy hot and not mixed well as I almost coughed it was so spicy on some bites.   The portion size it seems to get smaller and smaller every time we go which is a shame.  Round rice noodle that is barely stir fried when the ratio to bean sprout should not be 60%noodle/40%beansprout.    For what you pay for I expect more.  Now I understand why there was hardly anyone there during the middle of dinner. There was one other table with people.  Which at 6pm should tell us something.  My family won't be back and it's a shame as this place is close to home.  Maybe if I get desperate I'll grab a eggroll here but never will I sit down as their portions on the plate suck.  The one pic of the pad thai in a take out box looked like twice the serving I had on a plate which is sad."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! When I told the waitress I was vegan she immediately handed me a special menu. The result? The best meal I've had in ages!!! See the pics... I'm in love! I'll be back next weekend!!!"}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant on multiple occasions and have never been impressed. (I should add that my guest/boyfriend and family were born in Cambodia) The portions are tiny, the food doesn't taste authentic, therefore the price is too much for what you get. The restaurant is always empty, I'm not sure how they're still in business...  We will stick to Thai Spice."}
{"text":"Run. Don't walk. The menu may be a little overwhelming at first but if you're familiar with Asian cuisine you find new dishes you will love. I wish I lived here because I'd be a regualr. No doubt."}
{"text":"They don't serve the typical pho you expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. What they do serve is possibly the very best bowl of noodles in the city.  Small, humble menu, served with heart, and at a ridiculously reasonable price.  My girlfriend and I come here every single week."}
{"text":"Stop in for TLC (Thai Lao Cambodian) new year. Pho noodles soup and so on portions are small.  I like the egg rolls. Far from Authentic and I am Lao. I think this place is scared to step out from their demographic but I keep coming back. It's my 3rd time here. Cleveland hardly has any good southeast Asian legit spots. Maybe it's my calling..."}
{"text":"So i got to pick for date night. It was a poor choice. We both started with the pork rice soup, that broth was excellent. The presentation of all the food was attractive, but that is it for me and my bf. I got the kuy teav chha kreoung tek trey phem and it was dry. I got the combination meat, shrimp beef and chicken. I needed sauce and fresher food, I did not each much although it looked beautiful when it came out. My bf got the preah vihear i believe, and the beef had a gravy that tasted like a packet mixed with water from giant eagle, and his meat was tough as well. My bf was concerned when we walked in and we were one of two tables there at 730pm on a thursday. It looks like fellow yelpers has reviewed this place well, but I just cannot see how, the experience was lacking for us."}
{"text":"Carry out from here several times this year.  Always top notch.  Great menu and great value from both locations.  We also go in Ohio City a lot.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for good prices.  Decor and service were eh. I had the Medium spiced basil fried rice with chicken which was good and bright, jarringly, red.  Very good though and couldn't complain about $7 dinner price.    Their spring roll was as expected, but the chicken skewer appetizer, while flavorful, was tiny.  Overall, not a bad little neighborhood spot for cambodian/Vietnamese food in a place otherwise devoid of nothing but those options.  Although, when you say Vietnamese on the outside, I just assume there would be pho on the inside, and in this case I was mistaken"}
{"text":"Decent Cambodian/Khmer food but more importantly they are cheap which makes this place a great value. Huge item selection on the menu. Phnom Penh also offers Thai and Vietnamese dishes but I wouldn't be all over them. Thai dishes were so-so. Pad Thai was meh and why was it red? Why use Paprika? Vietnamese dishes were average and there's better place in Cleveland. Khemer dishes were the only saving grace. Overall, the food tends to lean toward being overly sweet.  There is not much ambiance due to its gloomy and dreary interior. The service was good though. Maybe a good take-out place when nothing else is around."}
{"text":"Great Cambodian/Vietnamese food. No Pho but so much more to offer. Pages and pages of exotic dishes to try! And everything was very affordable. I settled on a coconut curry noodle tofu thing. Don't ask me what it was, but it was so delicious. The coconut milk was whipped and in a layer underneath some of the veggies and sauce on top, adding a warm creaminess to the dish. The waitress was attentive but not that helpful. With all these options I could have used some direction - however it was an adventure just choosing something and seeing how it came out. I would love to come back and try some more of these great dishes."}
{"text":"Wow, first time here will be back for sure food was fresh flavorful and Sevice was impeccable, and the greatest thing was on a Saturday night no wait.. plus you can bring in your own bottles of wine!!"}
{"text":"We loved it, We went for the first time yesterday,my husband and myself, ordered all vegetarian items  tofu soup, a salad and another spicy eggplant and zucchini plate that I can't remember their names, but they were so delicious and filling yet light and healthy. We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Cambodian food is a bit difficult to describe.  The food we ate seemed like it had a bit of Chinese and a bit of Thai influence (I mean, they even have pad thai here), and yet it was very.. much.. different.    We had an egg roll, which differed from your traditional egg roll in that it seemed to be filled with bbq pork. We also ordered a Khmer Stirred Pan Noodle, which tasted like a pad thai except significantly less sweet.  We also had a a Mi Kontaang, which tasted like a Chinese beef Ho Fun (flat rice noodles) except with a more... tangy flavor?  All in all I think this place is worth a try because.. it's different."}
{"text":"A great place for Cambodian food.  Originally this was just take-out, but they have now set up a dining room, and it is really nice-- spacious, and with Cambodian artworks on the wall, and they're open for lunch.  Most of the dishes have lunch-portions, which are slightly smaller than the full dinner portions. For drinks, they have an amazing selection of fruit drinks, with a lot of tropical fruits you don't see around here very much-- try some of these out.  They also have Thai ice tea, and a sweet milk/iced green-tea. Food is great, but then I like Cambodian food, and it's hard to find a place for it.  I had the fried home-made tofu appetizer, then the Cambodian crepe, of course, and a Chha Kreoung-- all of which were good. We ordered the Chha Kreoung medium spicy, by the way, and it was just the way I like it, hot enough that I can feel it but not too hot to taste.  I'm glad I didn't go for the \"hot\" option. The ubiquitous Sri Racha is on the table for those who want more. They have a very extensive menu, and I certainly haven't tried everything on it!  We did go here one time and my wife thought it was unexceptional, and the dish she ordered had more five-spice than she liked-- but I had no complaints, I guess we'll just order something else next time. Nice place.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I hear this place has gone through some management changes, but we were just there and it was great. One of the few places to get an early lunch on a Saturday in the area, there was no wait. There's an extensive menu of both Cambodian and Vietnamese options at an inexpensive price point. You can order your food in any hotness option you choose and they stay within that fairly well. I think I could have safely gone to spicy but went with medium, which cleared my sinuses just right! I found this Phnom Penh a great spot with quality food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Eh.... I'm kinda disappointed with the food. My expectations were high, coming from authentic Khmer cooking myself. I ordered the Salaw Machu Kreoung \"Fantasy Stew\" and Chicken Chaa Kreoung (every Khmer person has had their fair share of both dishes and can name the exact person who makes the best of those dishes) but what I ordered here lacked authenticity. I feel like the restaurant catered more to the 'American' tastebud than trying to showcase REAL KHMER FLAVORS. The stew should NOT be as sweet as it is, it should be more pungent and tangy. The chaa kreoung was also sweeter than what I've had. It lacked the \"kreoung\" flavor that I anticipated. The \"Kreoung\" is a paste that is used in a lot of dishes composed of lemongrass, turmeric, galanga, garlic, shallots etc. But overall... eh, from what I'm used to from my family's cooking. People's reviews on here made the food seem BOMB and it was really just okay."}
{"text":"The food is the same as the other Phnom Penh location, which is a very good thing indeed. It's in a strip mall and not particularly exciting to look at, but having access to that level of food in the fast-food desert of North Olmsted is very exciting. Service is usually done by the owners, who are some of the sweetest people in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"About a year ago I spend a few days in Cambodia and fell in love with the simple, filling, and delicious food. In Cleveland there are about three Cambodian restaurants and all of them are really delicious. Phnom Penh in Ohio City is a quiet and simple place with attentive service, comfortable seating, and wonderful flavors. I've been here three times now and it never disappoints. The only difficulty is the menu is large and the names are tongue twisters for most of us. Read the descriptions and you should be fine. PS the soups are declicious and tasty and very large."}
{"text":"I was privileged to travel through Cambodia about a year ago and fell in love with the simple and delicious cuisine. There are actually 3 Cambodian style restaurants in the Cleveland area and I've enjoyed eating at each.  This is the one in North Olmstead and in the most modern building. It's clean and well lit and it  looks like they sell a lot of carry out. The portions are good sized and the flavor is very similar to what I experienced on the other side of the planet. Service is quick and pleasant - these folks are hospitable and want you to enjoy the experience. They don't offer a lot in terms of ambience but lets face it - I don't come for that - I come for good food.  They have an extensive menu and with a little patience you can select your protein, sauce, and noodle or rice preference. It's exotic and fun and I truly don't think that you can make a bad choice here. It is my third favorite out of the three but still solid and worth the money."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty Reasonable prices Gigantic selection of dishes to choose from Everything I've had here has been good Smoothies are quite tasty too I think even if you turned to a random page, closed your eyes, and pointed to a dish, you'd still end up with something satisfying No credit cards accepted though, so bring cash"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 3 times now.  It was my first Vietnamese cuisine experience.  The first two times I had been there the meal I ordered was very good though the portions are definitely on the small side compare to the other Vietnamese restaurants I've now been to.  The pho is very lacking in the flavor department. The bowl is considerably smaller than any of the other restaurants we've visited in Cleveland and they give many less bean sprouts/basil.  The third time we went they had removed what I ordered from the menu, which wasn't a great surprise as it had only been on the in house menu and not on their take out menu since we had first visited (early 2014)  Restaurant has been nearly empty each time we visited, twice during dinner and once at lunch. Hard to get the attention of the hostess as she hasn't had many customers to take care of and hides behind the desk.  Tip: Their \"hot\" was underwhelming, the woman who seems to take all orders suggested I order \"dragon hot\" next time.  All in all, it's close to my work and if I needed a fix, I can get to it in a couple minutes, but have chosen not to go for the above reasons. I'll save my money for the weekend with my wife and go elsewhere.  Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland is Tay Do, my wife likes Superior Pho similarly for the pho.  Also tried Cuisine Du Cambodge and Thai Spice."}
{"text":"I haven't had a lot of Cambodian food but I eat Thai and Vietnamese a lot and feel like I have a pretty good feel for this cuisine.  We had a good meal here last night but weren't wowed either.  I had cha kreouong with chicken, lemongrass, galanga.  It was spicy and tasty.  The chicken breast was a little dry but I liked the flavors.  We also shared the bahn sohn.  Noodles, with whipped coconut milk, sprouts, scallions, cucumber, basil, chicken, spring rolls.  This was pretty good.  The chicken had some curry but I was a little bored somehow.  I think I wished there was more coconut.  This is good solid food and I would go back and try more dishes.  The menu is gigantic.  This was 3.5 stars and might be 4 if I hadn't had better at Cuisine du Cambodge."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp, so I hope all goes well!    Recently, I visited the West Side Market.  Not wanting to look through the market in a hungry state of mind, I decided to look for somewhere to eat.  I asked a few vendors for suggestions and many of them suggested Phnom Penh.    Upon walking into the restaurant, I could definitely smell the delicious flavors coming from the kitchen.  I was greeted at the front of the restaurant and taken to a table.  The furniture and decor is the restaurant is nothing fancy, but I was there to try some great Cambodian food.   I explained to the server that this was my first time to the restaurant and asked her for some appetizer suggestions.  She suggested that I try the Mini Spring Rolls and the Nating.  The Mini Spring Rolls were very good.  Perhaps a little overcooked, but still good. The sauce that was served wit the rolls exceeded my expectations.  It was delicious!  I could've enjoyed it alone!  There were 7 rolls served.  I easily ate them all myself, but would be a great appetizer to share.  I also tried the Nating.  Wow .... the flavors exploded in my mouth.  Nating is coconut ground pork with crispy rice cakes.  It is served in a bowl and resembles chili at first.  The flavor was amazing.  I wasn't really sure how to eat it so I asked my server.  She said that many people dip their rice cakes into the bowl or use a spoon and put the nating on the rice cake.  The Nating is a little spicy, but unbelievable.  If you go to Phnom Penh, you must try this!    For my main course, I asked the server to recommend something Cambodian.  She recommended the Kuy Teav Chha Kreoung Tek Trey Phem.  It sis Vermicelli served with home made Kreoung-south Asia exotic mixed ingredients and sauce, chopped spring roll, slided onion, lettuce, Asian basil, chopped peanut and coconut whit.  You can choose the other contents ... seafood, beef, chicken, vegetables, or combination of all.  I chose the beef.  It is served in a bowl and you can choose the level of spicy.  I was conservative and went with mild.  My server warned me that hot meant HOT!  The dish was delicious.  I especially enjoyed the freshness of the vegetables a the peanut/cocunut sauce on top.  Next time, I may ask for more peanuts and it was delicious.    The menu is extensive and perhaps intimadating.  I suggest asking the server for help and suggestions.  I went with all of her suggestions and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Cambodian food, and it seems a little unfair to be comparing it to Thai restaurants and food? It doesn't say it's a Thai restaurant, and the only thing on the menu that has the same name as a Thai dish is the Pad Thai, which I haven't tried, but I also don't order sushi at Chinese restaurants. So, all of the dishes I've tried have been really, really good, great spice and flavors, and it's a large menu, so I tend to get a different thing every time. My absolute favorite thing is the ground pork natin appetizer. It's a little oily, but slightly sweet with coconut milk, and spicy and savory at the same time, love it."}
{"text":"I always ask the server what to get and I'm always happy. The house special soup to begin things is the best way to start, the artwork is outstanding and the whole place is clean.  Will be back no doubt!!"}
{"text":"Great! Had the amok siem reap and it was very flavorful. The description said it had crawfish but i didnt see it at all in the curry. Crab was also just crabsticks. Spring rolls were good too."}
{"text":"I read great things and wanted great things, but i got things that lacked greatness.  First, off the service was amazing. Like out of the world, order in and food out in less than ten mins. But service, while it helps, doesnt make a place amazing.  Second, the food. It was somewhat cold and the taste profiles seemed to be lacking something. Mint Cafe and Lemon Grass beat them for pad thai, which saddened me to no end. (Well till the end of dinner).   Third, the ambiance is gorgeous woodcuttings on the wall and just a nice homely decor. It also has a great westside location. But this couldnt rescue an otherwise lacking experience."}
{"text":"For our first night on project in this city, our team came here looking for some authentic Malaysian food. Spurred by numerous Yelp reviews on specific dishes, we tried them all out.  PROS: + Na ting: I'm still thinking of the sound that coconut milk and spicy sauce made when it sizzled onto the pieces of rice cracker. If you don't get this as an appetizer to share, shame on you. + Fried tofu: interesting choice of tofu for making this app, sauce accompanying it was spot on. + Pad thai: although it didn't look appealing (it was bright pink) the taste and texture made up for my initial reservations.  CONS: - Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt: not as great as I thought it would be. For one thing, we asked for it to be very spicy and it turned out to not be so hot at all. Another thing was what little meat there was was hidden by the green peppers and other vegetables - Thai tea: worst thai tea I have ever had -- watered down tea taste and wayyy too much sugar. How unfortunate :[  Come here for a quick and casual dinner with friends and share the appetizers. The entrees are solid for the most part, but as always, try new things not necessarily vetted by the Yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Phnom Penh a few tries before writing a review.  I can now say with confidence this place is a solid choice for good Cambodian/Vietnamese food.    I have dined in and carried out here.  The dining room is nothing great but the food makes up for it.  Service is fast I have walked in, ordered and had my food in front of me in under 15 min.    Everything I have tried at Phnom Penh thus far has been great.  For an appetizer the Natin and the spring rolls were spot on.  For entrees the Cambodian Crepe (#27) and the Chha Kreeoung with Chicken (#89) have stood out as my favorites.  Their \"Blended Tropical\" drinks are also surprisingly good.  Phnom Penh is now my go-to for carry out after going here several times the Americanized fare from other like places in the area no longer cut it."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. Soothing atmosphere in the midst of a busy Lorain Road in North Olmsted. Food was excellent. Food was well prepared with a touch of elegance. The menu is filled with a wide variety. Would come again.. Don't be fooled by outside appearance. This place is great!!! Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what to compare Phnom Penh to seeing that this is the first time that I can remember trying Cambodian food.  So my 4 stars are taking in the assumption that this is what it SHOULD taste like and that is delicious, minus the white tea I drank, but that was my fault.    This past Saturday I had hit the West Side Market for some shopping and had brought my wife and our new work friend from India that some met at the Yelp party, Mridul.  We decided to come here because we wanted something unique, quick, and easy on the wallet.  I convinced them by showing Cara's review because the wife loves Pad Thai where I personally have never tried it.  Mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so PP (Ha) was right down his alley.  For the appetizer we tried the PP Spring Rolls (4) and we all thought those were fantastic.  The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken / veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  Although all dishes were great, we all decided that the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai was our favorites.  We also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.    What a great first time.  I will be back and also want to try Pad Thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  Very cute place, and really reasonable.  Be forewarned though, they only take cash."}
{"text":"I hit up the West Side Market and was craving pho and Phnom Penh was in the area. I was skeptical to try their pho so I decided to give it a shot. I was disappointed and happy at the same time when my bowl of pho came out. The pho tasted great for the Cleveland area and especially for a place that is primarily Cambodian cuisine but the bowl was so small. My friends also had some traditional Cambodian cuisine (I believe it was either the Beef Bayon or the Amok Siemreap) and they enjoyed it very much, as well as the Guanabana drink they had ordered.  I'll give this place another try and I will definitely try their Cambodian dishes."}
{"text":"A fabulous place to become initiated into the flavors of Southeast Asia. Eaten here several times and no complaints, except for the time the server gave my food to the wrong customer and that stupid rude customer ate my food knowing full well it was mine. Otherwise the service is fast and friendly and anything with Thai basil is delicious! Pricey considering the portions but I'm willing to pay."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Pho!!! Always great service too.  The vermicelli with fish cakes are perfection every time. It's a small cozy place with sweet family employees."}
{"text":"Real Khmer food! The menu has a wide selection, and the dishes are well done. They're a little on the sweet side compared to my grandma's cooking, but that's all down to a personal preference.  If you are unfamiliar with Khmer food and looking to explore dishes besides fried rice and pad Thai, give the Mi Bompoong a try - crispy fried noodles with a flavorful gravy.   Feel free to ask the waiter for a picture menu if you can't decide based on description alone."}
{"text":"I am looooooooong overdue on this review of perhaps some of the best Cambodian food you will find anywhere.  Hungry and tired, Ki G. and I stumbled on while on a road trip after finding that our first choice of restaurant was closed and the market nearby was closed. Peeping inside, not a soul was around, though it was 4 pm. We decided to chance it anyway and boy were we happy we did.  We started with the Phnom Penh salad, which was very tasty. It was devoured in under 5 minutes. We then ordered two chicken dishes - Banh Sougnh and Chha Kreoung. Each portion is certainly big enough for two people to share but as I said, we were super hungry and happily devoured every last bite.  The service was really nice, with the guy running the place coming to check on us several times without being annoying. He came by several minutes after the entree came out to ask how we were doing, only to look down mid-sentence and discover we were nearly done. Sure we were hungry but it was also that good.  Go go go and support this local business. You'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. The biggest issue is poor service. Went for dinner last night two of the waiters sat in the corner eating and on there laptops.This has always been an issue, which could explain the vacant dining room most of the time. if the staff is not on their Ipads  or laptops they are attending to their children  who have a playroom set up in the restaurant. Going forward it will only be take out in this dark gloomy restaurant."}
{"text":"Good prices for the portions. I thought the seasonings were a little different. The pho was average. The medium spice is decently spicy."}
{"text":"Been there twice and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Don't know what some of these nay sayers are talking about.  Service isn't lightening quick, but when you deal with fresh food it sometimes isn't.  Would suggest Phnom Penh to  everyone who likes good Asian food."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price.  Had a noodle dish which was great, service was fast and courteous, but given that the place was rather empty this was expected.  I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is a sort of hidden gem. Unbelievable menu we had shrimp rolls which were delicious. Instead of thick peanut sauce usually served at most restaurants the sauce was a light fish sauce mixed with peanuts. I had pad Thai again a lighter sauce than most places I've eaten. My husband had Chicken Basil and that was wonderful as well. With the large menu I'll be back there quite a bit to try everything."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for her birthday last night, a group of about 10.  Saturday night at 7:30pm.  Pretty standard dinner time.  We received the worst service I've experienced in a LONG time.  It took us 1 hour to get our appetizers.  1.5 hours to get water.  I'm not even exaggerating.  When the waiter came over, he said \"sorry, but we're really slammed right now.\"  I am not kidding at all when I say HALF of the tables were open.  It's saturday night, half the tables are open and you say you're \"really slammed?\"   It would have made more sense to say \"two of our servers didn't show up today\" or something.  I have no idea what their employment situation is like, but apparently they are severely lacking.  Hire someone else for saturday night, if you can't handle your restaurant at half capacity.  We would have walked out if it weren't my girlfriend's birthday.  The only reason to go to this restaurant is that they are BYOB, no extra charge.  If you are not bringing booze, I highly suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Summary - Appropriate for those who like ethnic food and want a new experience. Also appropriate for those who want filling but healthy and veggie-based meals. Great for groups who want a BYO option.  I had (and highly recommend) the following: - #A1: Veggie spring rolls - #94: Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt with tofu (traditional Cambodian dish with ma rass prowt Cambodian veggie!), eaten with medium-hot spicy chilies on the side - #D11: Bal domnerb song kyar Pros: - Majorly fresh food. Completely and utterly fresh-to-death. So great. - Amazing spices!! You can get extra spicy chilies on the side and they are deliciousss if you're a spice baller - One of the better service experiences I've had in recent memory. Wanted our server to be my best friend. - Extensive menu with great vegetarian options - Greattttt dessert - i loveeeeeeeeeeee sticky rice!!!!!! - Clean, comfortable spot with a calm atmosphere - BYO so you can bring your own alcohol of choice!!!! They brought us some pretty damn cool wine glasses (read: chalices) to drink our wine  Cons: - Nothing really jumps to mind....which is rare for me (as an intensely judge-y human)  Longer post - Went in on a Wednesday night with friends with no reservation. Got a table right away as the place wasn't too busy. One friend came late, but the server was very sweet and patient and didn't seem to mind. My friend wasn't in a great mood when we arrived and was less than bubbly to the server, but, to his credit, the server was so awesome that he won her over and put her in a good mood! We cheered for my friend's birthday when she arrived - An hour later, when the server brought our dessert out, he had put a birthday candle in it and sang to her, without us even ASKING! This personal touch and kindness was SO unique to us and we totally fell for it. The server gave us great recommendations for what to order, as we knew nothing about Cambodian food, and we all LOVED our meals. It was clear he truly loves Cambodian food - he told us which dishes he remembered eating back at home with a wistful smile - and was proud of all of their dishes.  The portions were large and well worth the prices. The vegetables were SO fresh - way fresher than at other local restaurants I've been to like Banana Blossom. The food came out VERY quickly! We stayed past 9pm and didn't know until I signed into Yelp to write this review, but the restaurant actually closes at 8pm - the server just let us sit and keep chatting without bothering us!! Unreal. So amazing. Overall, a GREAT experience and we will definitely be returning and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place has AMAZING food. I usually get the Banh Hoy dish, because I love the variety of flavors in the dish. I have also had some of their noodle dishes before, and would say they are pretty good as well. I never knew there was Cambodian/Vietnamese food places around here until I came here. I first ate at their Cleveland location, and when I saw they had a North Olmsted location (which is closer to where I live) I was glad. I definitely recommend the Banh Hoy for the first dish to try."}
{"text":"Phnom Penh is the only restaurant that has managed to make my pad thai spicy enough."}
{"text":"Personally I would give a 3.5 for this place but since I can't, I had to lower it to a 3.   The menu is fairly large and I had almost no idea what 90% of the dishes were so I was left dazed.   I ordered the Cha Kreuong Ma Rass Prowt with chicken by looking at the yelp reviews. The dish was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. It tasted good but it just seemed lackluster and honestly, something I could make at home. My girlfriend had the shrimp pad Thai and even though it tasted fine, it just didn't hit the spot. I also ordered \"hot\" in which the waiter replied, \"it's very spicy.. be careful..\", but I had no problem eating it.   This place is a nice for lunch with decent portions and price but it hasn't really captivated me yet."}
{"text":"Incredible Cambodian & Thai food. Prices are very reasonable ($7 for Pad Thai, $12 for their specials) and it's BYOB. Service is friendly and prompt.  The tables and chairs remind me of a cafeteria, but the wooden reliefs and other decorations on the walls make it more elegant. With a bottle of wine, it would make a nice date spot.  Make note: Medium spicy = hot enough to make you sniffle (and that's coming from an Indian)  Interesting thing about their dishes is that they all seem to be very well balanced in their spices and ingredients. For instance, Pad Thai is standard fare at Thai restaurants, but it isn't always outstanding: sometimes it's too peanutty, sometimes too oily, too saucy, etc. These guys have found the perfect balance and it's one of my favorite things on the menu (one of the cheapest, too). Their Cambodian soups are also very, very tasty. A large bowl of soup ($5-6) is enough for a light dinner. Everything is great!! (just take it easy on the spicyness level or you'll end up drowning your dish in water and rice)  I think this restaurant was chosen #1 or #2 by Zagat......"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I love the food, but Roath Bun, the manager/owner is the most rude individual. I dine in regularly at the North Olmsted location. I have gone to the Ohio City location a few times and have always been happy. I did take out with a coworker, and I was very disappointed. I always order the Pho and when I do it comes with the leaves, sprouts, and chopsticks. When I did the takeout order none of these things were included. How am I supposed to eat the food without utensils? I reach out to the restaurant to resolve the issue, which Roath answered and told me that on the menu it states I have to order each item individually. I accepted this response and hung up the phone. When I looked at the menu it does not state that information anywhere. I reached back out and talked to Roath again, he told me that there is no way I would get those items without asking. His only resolution for the situation was to come back to the restaurant to get the extra items, when I told him I was at work and unable to do so he told me that was the only thing he could offer. I requested a refund and was told that he will issue a refund if he has the soup returned. Roath was extremely rude and unhelpful. Instead of hanging the phone up or apologizing, Roath set the phone down and left me there while assisting other consumers and continuing. I hung up and called back, Roath again said there's nothing I can do and to file a complaint if I would like. I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN. I cannot believe the responses and the way I was treated as a recurring customer."}
{"text":"The pineapple and jackfruit blended tropical drink was delicious - not too sweet and very creamy.   I also ordered the Bunn Cha Gio (I think) and while it was good, there just wasn't enough flavor for me. I had to add quite a bit of sriracha. The egg roll in the noodles was a delicious surprise, though."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Never had a meal less than excellent.  Great Pho, perfect rice paper rolls, and you cant go wrong with any of the large number of entrees."}
{"text":"The food is high quality and excellent spices. I agree with the other dinners that the portions are small for the prices but would still highly recommend. I drove by the restaurant many times and finally decided to try it and I am glad I did!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much hype about this place, and was so excited to finally try it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Took about 20 minutes to finally have a server even come to our table. We both ordered bubble tea, which they were apparently out of, so we ended up with an iced green tea (which was good) and a Diet Coke (which was flat). Another 10-20 minutes someone finally came to take our food order. We got the roll platter, which was excellent and seemed promising. However, there was nothing good about our actual meal. My boyfriend got a tofu soup, which he said smelled like a men's restroom, and did taste very strange. He also got a noodle dish, which tasted like the seasoning from cool ranch Doritos. I got the pad Thai, which seemed like a safe bet. But it had very little taste to it, which was surprising given that it was bright red for some reason. We just wanted to get out of there, and then there was yet another wait to get our check taken care of. I officially do not understand all the awards this place has gotten. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I like to eat a lot of meatless meals, and I love my veggies.  I need to eat GF, and this place has tons of options for me.  They make their own soy sauce, which is gluten-free.  So many options for me!  I often will phone in a takeout order and enjoy it at home.  Yum!  I've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I was here with my aunt approx. 5 years ago and have always wanted to return.  It was that good.  My husband and I came in for a late lunch after walking through the Westside Market.  There were only 2 other tables and the lone man working was very nice.  They were out of Thai iced tea, but he offered iced coffee, which was just as good so my disappointment was very low.    Several people came in during our meal and he was quite busy, but we still got efficient service.  My husband had Pad Thai and I had Neak Poan with shrimp.  It was so good!  It's a Cambodian dish with rice, basil, bamboo, pineapple and coconut milk.  Maybe I'll make it back before another 5 years goes by."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try Phnom Penh because of some of the reviews and opinions of friends. My uncle came to town from Louisville about a year ago and I took him to Cuisine Du Cambodge on Lorain for some Cambodian. He was back in town a few weeks back and wanted to return since he enjoyed it so much. Unfortunately, Cuisine Du Cambodge is closed for business on Mondays. I thought Phnom Penh was a good restaurant. We started with the salad which is similar to a papaya salad but served with cabbage instead. The nating was an interesting little pork dish that you dip little crispy rice cakes into. The Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt was pretty good although I prefer the place on Lorain. I really enjoyed the Bayon. I asked for it very spicy. So glad I did not go with what the server called \"Dragon Hot\". He advised that the level I had was 2 scoops of the chilli spice. I think \"Dragon\" level is 8-10 scoops. I thought the level down from \"Dragon\" was perfect and did not detract from the flavor of the dish. If you feel like you are ready to Enter the Dragon, tell me how that goes."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this quiet place.  The Pat Tai was excellent, not too hot, but just the right amount of kick."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. I have eaten here many times, and have never had a poor experience. The staff members are wonderful,  and the food is delicious. And the prices are unbeatable. Cannot recommend enough!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and the food is full of flavor. Very clean restaurant. Traditional Cambodian cuisine. The prices are on the higher end and the portions are on the smaller size. The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE this place. Its a family owned restaurant and you feel like they are serving authentic food out of their own kitchen. I love looking at the beautiful giant carved wooden panels on the walls. The owners are so friendly and offer great food suggestions. Since I'm not really familiar with Cambodian food, I always ask for their recommendations and they have never steered me wrong.   I typically get the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt with tofu and vegetables. It has a rich peanut sauce and fresh vegetables that I devour in its entirety every time.  For dessert I love the Bai Domnerb Song Kyar. Its a very unique dessert with sticky rice and coconut that is just the right touch of sweet.  Bonus - this place is BYO!"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian food in Cleveland by far! I was absolutely amazed by how good it was! I got the Chha Kreoung Marass Prowt and it was one of the most amazing dishes I've had at any of the Asian restaurants I've been to! It's full of delicious flavors and spices."}
{"text":"PULL UP A CHAIR and EAT IN.  Not just for take-out, anymore.  Website incorrect.  \"As a new patient, please arrive 15 minutes before       your appointment in order to fill out forms.\"  What's typical for first-time visits to doctors and dentists---not restaurants---could also apply at Phnom Penh.  If you're the type who's thoughtful about what you plan to choose---and not one to pick out just anything---I'd suggest: 1.) allowing 10-20 minutes to review menu options        and have any questions answered by staff,  2.) having your server recommend dishes, or  3.) pulling up their site beforehand.  (Click link on        their page.)  At first glance, formidable-looking at about 12 full pages in length (but there's lots of white space)---yet---still nothing to scan over quickly.  About 20 different food course \"subjects\"---from appetizers to desserts---with helpful descriptions for most, then protein choices with pricing.  This novelette could easily be condensed to a more manageable, patron-friendly pamphlet size.  Having been forewarned about length---and never being one to speed-read through a menu --I looked at their site in advance.  Of note regarding site pricing: less than menu pricing, dinner prices not listed.  In need of updating and completion.  Use as guide to food choices only.  PAD THAI * * * 1/2 . . . Thai (Phnom Penh's version); pork option, rice noodles, scallions, bean sprouts, ground peanuts, sauteed carrot, and pickled cabbage; Unexpectedly, somewhat sweet...perfectly-prepared orange-colored noodles (naturally food-dyed, but not with paprika---as someone noted). Enjoyed, but I'd had a taste for something more savory--not sweet--and never thought to ask when I ordered.  Should be indicated on menu, or mentioned by server.  Used table Sriracha to add heat---much better, then.    CHHA KREOUNG * * * * . . . Cambodian; beef option, lime leaves, garlic, tumeric root, galanga (sic) root, lemongrass, onion, green (or red) pepper, chopped roasted peanuts, and steamed rice...Savory...very flavorful--rice-worthy--sauce.  All fresh-looking and tasting.  Mine appeared to have bok choy, too.   Very good.     What I would consider small-sized portions---   unlike the \"generous\" mentioned on an earlier    2012 post--and we were there for dinner.    (Could be what we ordered.)    Were never asked heat level we preferred, and    we forgot to tell them.  Was still okay, but added    to the Pad Thai ourselves.  Maybe safer, adding    Sriracha on your own.  Likely, *that*---or chili oil---   is what they use in their kitchen, anyway.  First time we had food in a restaurant served on/in melamine plates and bowls.  Surprising.  Don't like that.  Plastic--I suppose--is okay for the occasional fast food and truck visits--being single use, then disposed of--but not for sit-down dining and multiple uses.  Plus, the plates were under-sized--smallest we'd ever seen for a restaurant entree.  We had to be especially careful at first, so that nothing slipped off, and onto the table.  Disposable place mats should be considered.  I've never trusted the use of plastics for foods--particularly, if warm or hot.   Plus, scratching from silverware, and hot wash water, will only wear away the surface, which then leaches chemicals and plastic particles.  Some might say this is harmless, but I'll always prefer traditional, non-porous materials for foods I serve, or am being served.

{"text":"I did not have a good first time here.  I ordered a specialty dish that was minced pork/beef in a red sauce. It came with crispy rice cakes that looked a lot like rice crispies but not sweet and gooey. These I liked.   But I could not stomach the minced pork/beef. The sauce was sweet and greasy and my stomach could not take much of it.   I like the fact that there is a Cambodian place in Cleveland. And I like eating various types of food. But this was one of those times where I was too unfamiliar with the palate to tell if the item had turned or was supposed to be that way.   I boxed the rest of it for later, and kept it in my car. Kinda grew nauseous on the way home.  I like the interior though. Very red, and there was a dragon I kept looking at."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: We came here - completely sober - on St Patrick's Day. Weird? Yes. But, it was quiet, we were hungry, and it's not fun to be the only sober person in a crowd of drunks.   I haven't been to Phnom Penh in a couple years. One thing that hasn't changed: horrible service. They are so slow and unorganized! The wait staff rarely checks in on you. I've always thought this place was a little tacky in terms of decor... but the stark environment compared to the chaos outside probably made it even more obvious. Definitely not the place to go on a first date in terms of ambiance, but I am not usually scared off my hole-in-the wall types of settings.   Food: Nothing spectacular. I really wish I wouldn't have ordered anything with seafood because some of it was definitely imitation. The shrimp were the most miniature ever - and the scallops? Ew. To be fair - it didn't taste HORRIBLE, it was just \"ok\". The fact that I hadn't eaten all day probably made it taste better than it should have though.   Definitely not somewhere I will rush back to."}
{"text":"oh my! I loved it! We got the soup - #8, #9 - we couldnt really tell the difference but the nice server guy said it was spicy and would clear our sinuses - it did! The soup was so flavorful, warming, comforting, sinus-clearing and delicious. Except it had giant spaghetti looking noodles which were super awkward and I would rather not have had them but I am not one to think that ethnic food should be told that something is wrong! Besides the weirdo spaghetti there was really just the beef, broth, and herbs. Don't get me wrong! It's perfect. It's so nice. One herb got like stuck on the back of my throat and i made embarassing noises until the server came to check on me. The server guy was like so friendly and nice - I loved him! Hubs just got a large soup. I got a small soup and 2 entrees cause that's how I roll. But honestly.... the small soup and the large soup were a similar size.  At the server's suggestion I got Original Khmer Stirred Pan Noodle and also whatever this is - Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt. Both were good! Cambodian food has super interesting flavors so I struggle to describe exactly what it tasted like but I enjoyed both dishes. I wasn't in love with either but I enjoyed trying them and both were fresh and tasty. The Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt was onion heavy but they were cooked really nice and I enjoyed them plus it seems healthy. Then I put some onions in my soup cause it seemed like there was an excess of onions in the dish and a lack of vegetables in the soup and then I instantly regretted this for an unknown reason and inexplicably hid them from the server with my spoon.   We were like the only ones there put if people tried the soup that we tried then they would go get it on these cold winter days.  Also just a reminder for you dear reader. Always make sure there is toilet paper. don't check after... but rather before."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not been to this place until now! After hearing rave reviews from others, I finally gave it a try, and I'm glad I did!  Came in on a Saturday early afternoon, we were the only ones in the restaurant (which didn't bother me). We were greeted right away and the woman (who I later found was the owner) brought us a menu, as well as a picture book with all the menu items (extremely helpful!). We ordered a frozen coconut smoothie, and an iced coffee with condensed milk. The coffee wasn't the best I've had for Vietnamese style coffee, but still pretty good. The smoothie was pretty good as well, although a little sweet for my taste.  We started off with an order of the fish cakes as an appetizer. They came out piping hot, and were delicious. They had a strong lemongrass flavor, complimented with green onions. Definitely had a homemade feel to it, in the best possible way.  For our entrees, we ordered the Hue Beef Soup with Tendons and the Special Bunn. The Hue Beef Soup was right up my alley; full of deliciously chewy beef tendon and vermicelli noodles in a fiery red broth. The portion size was very generous, and had good proportions of meat and noodles. The special bunn was great as well, with a medley of shrimp, bean sprouts, small fried spring rolls, and a strong curry flavor.  The woman taking our order (one of the owners) was also very nice, and took the time to converse with us after our meal.  Cannot wait to come back here and try more things off of their extensive menu! Also think this place would be fantastic for take out. Would highly recommend to others who enjoy trying ethnic and/or unique dishes."}
