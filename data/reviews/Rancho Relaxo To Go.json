{"text":"The food is authentic and at a great price! A little oily but tasty nonetheless :) I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am really not one to write bad reviews, but after the treatment, I just received I really feel I have to. I called Rancho Relaxo today to follow up on correspondence for my friend's wedding that had fallen off. We were very anxious to move forward and pay for the service but were not getting any replies past the first couple of emails so today I called and was told to speak with Donnie. When I finally got him on the phone to ask for menu details, pricing and payment he told me 'he didn't like my attitude and that I should take my business elsewhere' when I said 'I'm just trying to pay you I'm not sure where this is coming from' he said 'you're crazy if you think I can feed people for that budget!'  I have never had such horrible customer service in all my life! Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"You have not lived until you have their fish tacos! Best place. Loved the old Rancho on College, and this cute little place continues the legacy. Great vibe, a few tables if you want to eat in, amazing prices (that include tax!) Plus the best guac ever that they make in house. Get the fish tacos- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito. They tried...  But hey, I got a bag."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and always found the burritos to be decent and a fair price. But I was there today with my family and saw the two employees handling cash/debit machine and touching the food without changing their gloves. The female employee even went downstairs with her gloves on for a while and came up (still with her gloves on) and started handling food right away. I only hope she wasn't in the bathroom.... Anyways, we mentioned it to the staff and threw out the food. I was hoping to see this place succeed in the neighbourhood. Hopefully they'll change their poor hygiene habits before someone gets sick."}
{"text":"Delicious.  The perfect take out spot.  We ordered fish tacos, pulled pork tacos, chicken burrito and chicken lime soup (extra yummy). The tacos were generous and moist, very tasty, the soup was so yummy and the burrito just as a burrito should be.  It was all very good and carefully prepared.  It's a clean place with staff who care about the food.  We love to eat Mexican food and have tried most in the city, many multiple times, and this place can easily hold it's own.  It's also wonderful to see that many vegetarian and gluten free items, alongside the meat ones.  We'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the neighbourhood with plenty of healthy options... Everything is sooooooo good. Make sure to try there 'pulled yam' burrito.. Also love there Rancho chicken burrito, fried fish,, even there faux chicken and beef are awesome. Not typical ground round but actual beef texture pieces.. Better quality ingredients then other burrito shops. Great value, good sizes and quick service. Definitely one of., if not the best place to eat in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and drove by this place several times and today finally decided to give it a try.   I got the cauliflowers taco and it tastes great. So you might wonder why the 2 stars review.  The reason for the 2 stars is because the safety cleanliness. There was 1 person at the counter and she took my money with gloves on and use the same gloves to prepare my food. Basic food safety 101. Also, instead of refilling the cheese with a new container, she just add the cheese on top of the old one -no rotation of new and old...  so no matter how food taste, I don't want to get sick so I don't think I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Decent burritos but this place needs a hygiene check. Neither of the staff behind the counter were wearing gloves and were moving between touching the food and handling the cash. Funny thing is there was a box of rubber gloves on the counter top. Would really like to see this place succeed in our neighborhood but check yourself before you wreck yourself!!"}
{"text":"I used to love the burritos at the restaurant on College, so when we were passing by this place,we stopped for dinner. I had the 2/$10 quesadillas - I got 1 pulled pork (AMAZING!), 1 chicken (also very tasty).  I found the sizes good, and there was lots of stuff inside (rice, beans, cheeeeeeese).  I liked the homemade chipotle sauce. My friend got the beef burrito and said it was really good.  We split an order of guacamole & chips, and OMG the guac!   Menu had some good vegan options too, so I'm bringing my picky vegan friend next! Overall, I'd recommend.  The place was clean, comfy and the food was exactly as awesome as I'd hoped."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting from out of town. I got the (fake) beef burrito, which turned out to be seitan. It was amazing, the size was good and the guac was amazing.  The friends I went with both loved what they got (a veggie burrito and a chicken burrito) and raved about the food as well.  The main reason I'd go back- which I plan to- was for the excellent customer service, which went above and beyond what I would normally expect. Overall a good experience and would recommend this place to anyone who loves delicious Mexican food, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Glad to see this place has returned! Although slightly different with a more take out style ambiance instead of the sit down restaurant it was previously, old favourites have returned.   You can still dine in, but now it's more a hot table environment with limited options, the excellent burrito dinner you could enjoy is now available as a sandwich only option, which is absolutely fine with me as it's rather filling on its own.  I noticed a taco and beer option on the menu as well. As well as a few other choices, which I will update this review with next time I return.   Delicious food in a take out or sit down environment, an old favourite, I'm very happy to see back on College St.. definitely will be patronizing this place again and again"}
{"text":"Not a big burrito eater but the tacos are my go to, and they are delicious. Fish tacos is what I normally get. Would definitely recommend getting something here!!"}
{"text":"Finally a great Veg take-out option! Faux beef is my fave and faux chicken is my bf's fave. Large portions and friendly, positive customer service... which is getting to be scarce in this city - therefore making this a gem!"}
{"text":"So I can't speak on behalf of all locations but I can speak on behalf of Owner Donnie, and food truck operator Yurgo. These two gentlemen are absolute stars. I've been to the restaurant a few times and the food is absolutely amazing. I signed on with Yurgo to bring the truck to my wedding as my late night station. Wowee, my guests are still talking about how amazing that food truck was to finish off the night. An absolute gem."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tacos for $10 - the pulled pork ones are good, but the fish ones are mediocre (overcooked, hard, and not a lot of fish meat...) My friend got the burrito bowl and she said it was bad. I don't know if I'd give Rancho Relaxo a second chance to be honest..."}
{"text":"We were on our way to stop in for some baguettes at the shop next door and saw this restaurant.  Quickly googled, saw it was enticing and decided to also pick up a sampler as well.  Ordered the mix 'n match 3 for $10 tacos and had the fried shrimp, fried fish and pulled pork.  Very good taco sizes as allows you to sample without being overly full.  Pulled pork was our least favourite as it was a tad on the dry side.  Both fried shrimp and fried fish knocked it out of the ball park!  Crispy, flavourful and savoury, topped with garnishes and sauce.  Noticed that they had a Foodora sticker on the front door.  Would consider ordering via delivery!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I cannot get enough!! I LOVE the Beef burrito & Chicken Quesadilla!! Pico de Gallo is to DIE for as well as both of their home made salsas!! YES PLZ!! I go here a few times a week. SERIOUSLY!!  SUPER friendly staff that I know by name. Great place to eat or take out from!"}
{"text":"The best vegan burrito I've ever had. The faux beef strip burrito is my all time fav."}
{"text":"I was in the area for an appointment and I have always been a huge supporter of the restaurant so I was excited to finally get to try their new location. I wanted a burrito, and was just excpecting a normal veggie/bean one but, they have vegan options!! I got the faux chicken (seitan) and it was so yummy and cooked perfectly . I was recommended the smaller size and I'm glad I did because it was a perfect dinner portion for me. The staff was incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about the food. Walking me through all the add ons to the burrito they had some interesting ones like cactus and pickled onions! They also told me to try their house made hot sause (even though they had a bunch of different options to satisfy any spice lover) and I'm so glad I did. Just spicy enough with so much flavour. The staff was attentive to me even after I had got my food. It's clear it's not just a 'to go' place. The decor is reminiscent of the restaurant and it was very warm and cozy. Definitely a great spot! Worth going out of your way for!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken lime soup...which in theory should have been excellent, however it was served to me colder than room temperature!  Soup is a pretty easy thing to get right. It's a simple responsibility to make sure that the product is hot when it is served. And if it's not, don't just let it slide? I find it rude, embarrassing and disruptive to walk back up to the cash and tell them the soup isn't hot. It just annoys everyone else in line.   Get it right the first time guys. People are paying you money to prepare and serve hot food - it's negligent and lazy to give someone a bowl of cold soup."}
{"text":"These burrito makers are a confused pair behind the counter. Maybe it was the maker, maybe it was the cash girl labeling the to-go bags. Either way, when ordering a burrito told them I have allergies and had them pull out the ingredients book list and tell me everything that is in the food I was ordering. Satisfied with the preparedness to answer my questions, I proceeded with my order. I left and continued to mow down my burrito then realized a couple of bites in, they have given me someone else's burrito causing me a reaction (personal injury) because it had multiple ingredients I was avoiding. When I came back, they may have been a little embarrassed but quite passive about my situation and simply passed me the proper burrito which was still sitting there and rushed me out the door. This shows negligence at the very least."}
{"text":"The good: You can get tacos, quesadillas, burritos or a bowl. Vegan options and vegetarian options with faux beef and faux chicken, pulled pork, shrimp, fish etc Prices are cheap 3 tacos for $10, 2 for $10 quesadillas and 10$ large burrito small was $8 I think The bad Lacking in flavour. Filling and it looks good but I suppose if like fiery hot you could just put hot sauce on it.  Conclusion:It's more of a fast food joint now. The food came quickly and I ordered the fried fish & pulled pork. If you want filler and taste isn't a high priority, then this place would fit the bill. Personally I wouldn't go back. There's too many other places to try."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big taco fan but Rancho Relaxo changed that quickly.   I ordered the mix and match tacos ($10) two fried fish and one pulled pork. The pulled pork taco was okay, nothing too wow and I don't think I'd be getting that again but the fried fish taco is my absolute favourite! The fish is rolled in frosted flakes so it has a great crunch and all the toppings went with it so well. This is something I highly recommend!   Will be returning to here because work is soooo close by :)"}
{"text":"Cauliflower tacos were too salty. Pulled yam burrito was good. Pulled pork burrito was good. Overall it was decent but I wouldn't eat it again. There are much better places to buy tacos in Toronto."}
{"text":"Superb veggie burrito! Lovely staff!  Would have given 5 stars except no whole grain option for the burrito, what the what?   We're trying to not let eating out mean junk food, people.  The right whole grain burritos are delicious, and they might have more structural integrity for those last few burrito bites, my white flour tortilla kind of fell apart at the end.  But still: delish!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan so I normally get the faux chicken or faux beef burritos as a creature of habit those are my go too options. However today I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to give the Tofu Jerk Tacos a try absolutely delicious without a doubt. I'm always skeptical about trying jerk as I am from the home of jerk seasoning (Jamaica)...it for sure surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service ! Definitely my \" go to \" place now!  Food was fast and very filling!  Tons of amazing choices including fish tacos to die for"}
{"text":"mexican decor giving off a vibrant vibe this is enticing  i got three tacos which needed corn tortillas instead of flour  crispy fish filet topped with pico and lettuce standard, but not bad  overcooked chicken supposed to be jerk flavoured spice came from salsa  fried cauliflower dressed in pico de gallo it was just alright  can't fault the portions loaded tacos, but they're just... satisfactory"}
{"text":"I first discovered their food after waiting in an hour+ line for the food truck at a music festival.  That hour was one of the best time investments I've made because I discovered some of the best tacos and quesadillas I've ever had.  3 tacos for $10 or 2 quesadillas for $10.  My date usually gets the tacos and I usually get the quesadillas.  Every single one is great - the fish, shrimp, pulled pork, chicken, even the veggie.  Don't miss their sides either; the kale and yams is delicious (just add some salsa or hot sauce for a little extra flavor).  I honestly can't get enough of their food and I'll be dreaming about it until my return!"}
{"text":"Pros: good vegetarian & vegan options, prices include tax, friendly staff, interesting toppings and variety of sauces, gauc isn't extra but standard (as it should be), tasty beans. Spicy had nice kick.   Cons: No whole wheat tortilla, big burrito isn't big. Needed more beans. (Fat Bastard small burrito is larger than the big here.)  Overall, I could taste each element of the burrito and it was fresh, but I'm not sure it was worth $10. We'll probably come back because it's 2 mins walk from home not because it's a stand out place."}
{"text":"Really love the tacos here and the staff are very friendly. Favourite are the pulled pork, jerk chicken.  Kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"People working behind the counter were so friendly! Loved the tacos - jerk chicken and fried fish were my favourite. Pulled pork quesadilla was great. Wasn't a fan of the chicken quesadilla personally, kinda slimy peppers and onions involved but everything else was super tasty and price is amazing! I'll be back!"}
