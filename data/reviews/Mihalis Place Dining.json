{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST - HEALTH DEPT SHOULD CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN I' ve been a regular customer at Mihalis for over three year.  I've always liked the food and the service.  I've brought my entire family and friends from out of town here on many occasions.  I didn't mind the plastic flowers all over the place covered in dust.  I was in denial when a friend told me she will never go back cause she got food  poisoning there.  Today I went in for lunch and ordered a French onion soup and sandwich.  Waitress advised it is not part of soup and sandwich special - no problem.  When I took my first taste of soup, I noticed something in the soup.  Discreetly I advised the server that there was something in the soup that didn't belong there and couldn't eat it. She looked at it and said, \"ewww I'm sooooo sorry\".    She took the soup into the kitchen and I could hear the cook/owner yelling at her, \"It's a piece of onion, there's nothing wrong with the soup, she will have to pay for it!\"  Server came back red-faced and apologetic that the owner said I have to pay for the soup that I had not touched.  I was shocked.  I had been a long time customer and I was very cautious not to make a scene but the owners attitude has left me more angry than the soup.  I paid for the soup I didn't touch and left knowing I will not return.  It was definitely a centipede in the food and I would not go back if you paid me."}
{"text":"Omg.   Short story: avoid avoid avoid.  Read on if you must.    Went here for a quick breakfast today.  Coming from an early appointment at the nearby Albany clinic my wife and I thought we could get a standard \"greasy spoon\" breakfast.    Oh we got much more than that.    We both ordered 2 eggs, bacon and home fries.    The orders came up quickly.   That's where the good news ends   My plate smelled distinctly like fish.  After a couple bites i was definitely tasting fish and I noticed my wife was picking at her food too.    I called the cook over (Mihalis) and explained it was not pleasant.   He quickly assured me that he would make another dish and he felt perhaps the potatoes had picked up a fishy taste from the deep fryer.    My wife mentioned that she felt it was the bacon.   He vehemently denied it could be the bacon.     Moments later a new plate was presented to me.    Potatoes were fine.  No fish taste.  But The Bacon was another story.  The Bacon.    In fact the bacon was so bad that when I took a bite...you know that feeling when you eat something that's way off like your body won't even let you swallow it?   And then you throw up in your mouth....  Ya.   That's what happened.    I loudly asked the server to take it away and told the cook that it was most definitely The Bacon.    My wife looked a little green by this point as she had already swallowed a half a piece of her bacon.     The waitress and cook denied there was any issue but took away the food just the same.    Moments later we were presented with a bill for just one of our breakfasts.  Like getting 50% off rotting food would somehow make it better.     It's been a couple hours.  I am still off the whole idea of eating...and well, my wife?  She's still green and has been violently ill twice.     How do places like this survive? By preying on seniors and other walk bys from patients at one of the largest clinics in Toronto.      Anyone want to open a competing breakfast joint right next door?   Easy pickings.      Avoid.  Not only was the food horrible.  The atmosphere was pretty sad. And the service and response to this issue were terrible.   I would give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"My entire family had been going to Mihalis' Place since the original owner, Mihali (Greek) opened, years ago. Then, also years ago, Mihali sold to his employee, called Stan (Polish). The food was always good, the place was clean - and always very busy, the service was friendly, and the portions were generous. After a period of fewer, sporadic visits, and mostly hurried takeaway meals, we dined there again a few days ago. It is the same people, husband and wife, but it was a completely different experience. After enjoying a few hundred meals there, we were shocked at the changes. Immediately upon entry, the OVERPOWERING odour of sewage emanating from the basement was stomach-turning. Nevertheless, after a short time, we acclimatized. The wine helped! There were only two other diners - never a good sign - and the wife sat at the bar/counter and talked on the phone incessantly throughout the duration of our stay. The other background sound, annoyingly, was a radio station. No one wants to hear advertisements and talking while they are eating, even in an ordinary neighbourhood restaurant. Stan, the cook, was dressed in a filthy shirt and apron that once had been white. No niceties were exchanged, and inquiries were not made as to how we were. The soup was strangely cloudy, a dull greenish-grey colour, and tasted like something not found in nature. It was not only nothing like what it was supposed to be, it was entirely indiscernible and unidentifiable in every way, so we abandoned it after first tastes. One dish - a colourful house specialty - should have been served in tomato sauce, as it always was, but was running with - and sitting in - watery liquid, and had very little taste without the additions of salt and pepper. It was also a hideous grey hue. Another dish was a dried out, rock hard sliver of meat that had been overcooked, not necessarily that day. Yet another dish, a vegetarian option, was so grossly overcooked as to appear and taste as if it had been prepared well in advance, and reheated upon ordering. The accompanying vegetables were a really sad, packaged, frozen mixture, water-logged, chewy and utterly tasteless. This couple, who once was upbeat and cheery, has lost ALL zest for running their once thriving restaurant, and, seemingly, for life itself. We did not get sick, yet we felt sick as a result of the disgusting odour of sewage, and the shameful, revolting food that we were served - in a dreary atmosphere, and in dirty chef's 'whites'. Not wishing to offend, we claimed fullness and asked for takeaway containers, yet disposed of the contents. Like the original Mihali, the good days are a thing of the past at Mihali's Place. My advice is: quit while you're behind."}
{"text":"This is a place that looks like a dive but the food is actually amazing. The Liver and Onions is my favorite. The owners are so warm and clearly family owned. The Breakfast options are amazing and just well made. It's one of those places that doesn't get a lot of action due the look but go in and let the owners and the food change your mind."}
{"text":"Okay so let me start off by saying yes I gave this place 5 stars not because it is a fancy expensive mind blowing restaurant, I got it 5 starts because it well exceeds what you might expect from this place.    I must have gone to Mihalis at least 100 times.  I live in the area and it's always my go to restaurant whether I dine in for dinner, breakfast or do pick up.  The service and food is consistently excellent!  It's a family run restaurant and they truly make you feel like part of the family.   The atmosphere.  They've done a few things over the past couple years to make it a little nicer like the wood floors and some of the paintings on the wall.  If they spruced it up a little more it would be amazing to look at but it's always clean and tidy so I don't really care about the decor.   The staff is ridiculously friendly.  All the time.    The food.  Serioulsy, this is some of the best European food I've head.  Ever.  My favourite dishes are the following:   Pork Tenderloin with Dumplings - Special Let me start off by saying I almost never eat pork besides bacon.  But this is amazing!  Too bad it's only a special.  Wish it was on the regular menu.  Although sometimes if you ask they can make it for you.   German Schnitzle - Special It's schnitzle with mushrooms and gravy.  Could there be anything wrong with this ever? Also a special but they'll mostly make it for you any given day.   Goulash with Potato Pancake - Special This is AMAZING!  They only make it every other Thursday.  It's sooo good, the only thing I wish is that they didn't put so many bell peppers in it, cause I hate bell peppers.    Greek Salad with Chicken  So simple yet so delicious  Soups - All of them.  They are amazing!  I love the dill pickle one and the cabbage soup, my boyfriend got their vegetable with macaroni the other day and I don't really like tomato based soups and it was amazing!   I've never tried anything bad there.    The one thing they could improve on is dessert.  They have a few options but the food is just so amazing that the dessert pales in comparison.   I wish they delivered!  I would honestly order every week!  If you haven't been GOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Spent a lot of money here for the combo. Took a long time for them to prepare it. Took it home and it was bad. It smelled off and we didn't eat it because we didn't want to get sick. Would never go here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.   When you walk by, it may not look as the most inviting place to eat at, but don't let the exterior fool you.  Their food is delicious, very homey and for those who miss authentic Eastern European food, this is the place to eat at.  Their portions are big, so you usually get two meals out of one.  I'm a sucker for pierogi's and Michalis doesn't disappoint. They even come with saut√©ed onion and bacon, just like your babcia makes them."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time for breakfast over the last couple of months.  They have a wonderful Eggs Victorian.  The eggs were poached as requested.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious.  Their hash browns were delicious. They are friendly.  The food was fast, but it didn't take long either.  The portions don't look like a lot but I was certainly full when I left.  Don't know how their lunch is, but I would definitely go back for breakfast again."}
