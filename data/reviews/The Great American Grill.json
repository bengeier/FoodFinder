{"text":"Service and food was excellent. After long day of travel, nice to stay in at hotel and food was worth it. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Stayed in the hotel for dinner because I was tired and wanted to get work done. Should have gone out. Ordered hummus appetizer and a salad with grilled salmon. Anything but quick. Appetizer took a long time, then the salad took even longer. Hummus was grainy and not very tasty, though the presentation and the pita with roasted peppers was Ok. When the salad got there the salmon was over cooked, as in smelling burnt and dried out all through. Wasn't crowded so no excuse there.  Wait staff was nice, so there's a star. With some nice places so close to the hotel, just walk down the street."}
{"text":"Not the run of the mill HGI bar. Decent beer selection, and friendly staff. Lots of options outside the hotel, but this place is handy when your to tired to venture out. Bartenders are attentive, accommodating, as well as capable. Pleasent surprise!"}
{"text":"Visiting the city, we stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in which the restaurant is located. They have a happy hour with drink and appetizer specials 5-7. We had steak quesadilla,  bourbon wings,  and fries. Delish!!!! Very impressed by quality and taste. Add the hot tea and a beer... cost during happy hr was $22."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton Garden for a week, I usually avoid food at moderate priced hotels but I had a meeting and was pressed for time so I decided to grab dinner at The Great American Grill in the hotel.  I was very impressed!  I ordered the Surf and Turf which is a steak and grilled shrimp.  The steak was excellent for a steakhouse, let alone a hotel.  Really tender, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  The shrimp was great too and seasoned very well.  Even the veggies were great.  I had this meal twice and both time the chef came out of the kitchen to ask if I enjoyed my meal!   I was there for 7 days and didn't eat there until my 4th day there.  Considering the meals I had at some of the local restaurants, I wish I had ate there the first night I arrived."}
{"text":"Looks like a modest hotel bar/restaurant; looks are deceiving. Christene really makes the restaurant shine. Great place to grab anything from a burger to something more, such as the salmon and mashed potatoes that I had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"just had wings and a few drinks.  The wings were very delicious and seemed fresh...crispy (bourbon sauce).  Nice atmosphere for a small hotel.  Sat outside after near the firepit.  Waitress/barmaid was very nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Amy this morning at the Garden Grill! I frequently stay here and grab breakfast at the grill and the service is almost always good! What I appreciated about Amy this morning was ZERO argument about my asks. They're pretty simple yet asking outside what's printed on the menu can sometimes spark too much conversation when I haven't had coffee yet! I ordered a 3-egg omelette (the menu says 2 eggs) with jalape√±os (not listed), spinach, and other veggies with a side of avocado  (not listed!)   It's the little things in life!   Thanks Amy for the great service! I'll be back!  PS: My fab breakfast plate photo disappeared. User error yet trust me, it was beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this place and hotel is outstanding! That being said, here is how I came to find this out. I was relocating to the Phoenix area and needed to stay in hotel until my house was ready. I made a thirty day reservation, and on my first day went hiking. To make a long story short, I was arrested for disturbing a javelina breeding ground in a national park- which apparently is frowned upon. As a condition of my pre trial release I was placed under house arrest (hotel arrest) and was not allowed to leave the hotel until about 45 days went by. (Due to my ankle bracelet)... Ok onto why this place is great. I was forced to live in the hotel for 45 days and eat three meals a day there. Every single meal was delicious and cooked to perfection. The chief was a professional and gentleman. The bartender I think her name was either Christene or Francesca was always quick with a beverage, my food and even in telling me if I wandered more than 100 feet from the interior of the property so I didn't violate the terms of my release. would recommend the wings, half baked chicken and turkey club to eat. The best thing is even though they say they close at 10 am they will stay open as late as you want as long as you remain conscious with available credit on your card.   Finally, Frank, the night manager, is among the nicest humans on earth."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was delish, but menu was VERY SMALL not much to choose from. The bartender does it all  while tending to the bar and he was awesome."}
{"text":"Service is super good. It's definitely inside the Hilton, just so you don't get lost. We ordered an appetizer a salad, and a half chicken. Appetizer was fantastic. Salad was full and large. Chicken was mediocre. Tasted like it wasn't cooked with any seasoning, and all the flavor was added just before playing. I'm sure that was just a dud. Menus is pretty small though. Lots of variety though."}
{"text":"My brother and family stayed at the hotel and we met for breakfast buffet here. It was really nice, the service was very personable and the food was good. The choices were good and hit the right spot. Love that the staff was very attentive to the food and drinks. Would definitely go back if more family comes back into town."}
{"text":"Box lunches for meetings here are terrible! The sandwich was dry, very little meat, and they didn't offer us any condiments. On top of that there was an old piece of fruit instead of chips, and a cookie that was as hard as a rock and tasted like it was a left over from a previous day. If you have a business meeting here, DON'T ORDER THEIR LUNCH!!!"}
