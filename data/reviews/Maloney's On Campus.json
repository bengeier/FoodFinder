{"text":"Lots of breast to be had here, and no I'm not talking about the sceney ASU bar scene. Do yourself a favor and go to Maloney's Tavern in Tempe for the Fiji Chicken Sandwich.    This was the best pub grub sandwich I have had in the longest time. 10 ounces of juicy blackened chicken breast, avocado, tomatoes, sweet onions on a kaiser roll with monterey jack cheese, sweet jalapeno mayo and fries.  I mean isn't 10 ounces two breasts worth?  Granted I've only ever been here for food, not the drinks or the bar scene...but the food (at least the fiji chicken sandwich and fries) is a solid four stars.   Reserving a full four star review when I come here for drinks if I ever do.  Btw, watch for shifty and ragged bar stools.  Poked, screws, ripped up stools...you put it together."}
{"text":"My husband calls this \"male onlys\" for the 10 to 1 ratio of guys to girls at this bar.  I call it the \"I am way too old to be here because I stopped using a fake ID years ago\" bar.  It is a haven for ASU students and graduates that can't give up the college life.  The five dollar big beers and classic movie clips are the two stars for this bar."}
{"text":"It is getting to where I actually prefer Tempe bars to Scottsdale bars, though society dictates it should probably be the other way around. I mean, I'm not in school anymore, and I should want to be surrounded by young professionals like myself, right?   Wrong. The Maloney's in Tempe is a reminder that even though I am not in college anymore, part of me definitely wishes I was. The scene here reminds me a lot of a bar I used to frequent near my school in California, before people checked your car or designer labels on your clothes like somewhere else I know that rhymes with Nottsdale.   It gets a little frattastic at times, but despite that, I usually have a pretty good time here pretending like I'm still in school."}
{"text":"The Devil's Advocate is the new Maloney's on campus. It is now more of an ASU bar with great food. Lots of ASU memorabilia , great food, cold drinks, and top notch service. We are opening the week of Oct 1st. Just in time for Pac-10 play. Go Devils. We brought in an executive Chef for an entirely revamped eating experience. Hope to see all of the old faces back and many new ones as well. Get ready for Tempe's original 2-4-1 Thursday night special as well."}
{"text":"When I was in college, I loved Maloney's.   Now that I'm out (okay, waaay out) I hate it. Why? Oh maybe because it's filled with underagers with fake id's and horny college guys that think humping you from behind is a form of dancing or because it just makes me feel old. So this is my suggestion: if you're in college or just a bit older, definitely go to Maloney's- it's always packed, they play fun music and have great drink specials. If you're older and want to party with people your own age, go to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This location is Closed, drove by yesterday and there is a sign for \"Station No 1\""}
{"text":"The food here is only mediocre in my opinion.  I've done the ravioli for lunch.  The service was very, very painfully slow, even though only one other table occupied the restaurant that Thursday afternoon.  The French Fries are very good though, and you get a whole BUCKET when you order 'em, so be prepared to share or take them home with you.  The drink specials are really great, especially the 2-for-1 specials that run on Saturday nights til 11:00PM.  This place gets ridiculously crowded at night, so come early to get a seat."}
