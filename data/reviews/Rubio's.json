{"text":"Great service, you can always count on a sincere smile when you come here! Fish tacos are good but many of the other good items could use more flavor."}
{"text":"I feel like this location has gone down hill in terms of quality of food and staff. We used to use them for catering regularly but have not as much recently. They have a good menu but it's become so diverse that it is hit or miss."}
{"text":"My brother and I came into this location and we were the first ones of the day. It started out that they were out of steak which we understand that happens. But then as we sat down we overheard a tall guy behind the counter talking to who we thought was a customer about how bad the employees the night before did. He mentioned them by name and basically continued to bring them down while making himself look good. Come to find out the one he was talking to was the general manager and family sitting down to eat. Regardless of the night before, it is extremely unprofessional to be speaking where everyone can hear...especially the managers. We came in to eat not.to listen to the stores problems and especially not to listen to other employees get bashed by the GM and others. Considering you (and I won't mention your name) was standing behind the counter doing nothing the whole time we were there, you have no room to talk about others. We did however receive excellent customer service from a guy named Michael. Thanks for that! Michael, you get 5 stars! I hope your peers can pull their heads out and knock this kind of behavior off and be more professional. Thanks."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent Rubios customer at this location. I always get great customer service from a young lady names, Amanda. She knows what I order and gets my order right every time. Great job, Amanda!!"}
{"text":"Although Rubios falls in the genre of fast food, this location always has amazing fish and shrimp tacos and a friendly staff. This is an annual stop for my husband each year during our Barrett Jackson weekend visit to Scottsdale. My favorite is the blackened tilapia fish taco and my husband's is the classic grilled shrimp burrito. If you like coconut, the lemon bar makes a great desert."}
{"text":"Their grilled shrimp is the Bomb! The location is also very convenient. Walking distance from a lot of other grocery stores, shopping places and restaurants. The place is also very clean and staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service at this location. I go out of my way to eat at this Rubio's as the staff, especially management, is always friendly and fun. This location seems to have the best Churros too!"}
{"text":"Love Rubio's but especially this one. It's always clean, the service is awesome, the salsa bar is always full and clean and employees are super friendly and all smiles. This place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Rubios...gourmet fast food. I absolutely love the gourmet steak tacos and shrimp burrito. That's all I get because I don't need to be adventurous on the menu at times. I did try their citrus shrimp burrito and absolutely hated it, I had way too much citrus flavoring or whatever that was on my burrito. It tasted like I liked and ate the skin of the orange."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time...yes, I HAVE been living under a rock.  I tried the California Bowl, and it was very good.  I also tried the classic taco and I loved it!  They were quick and very polite, and overall I had a great experience.  It was a little pricey (I think I paid about $13 including tax), but the flavor was good and I think it is a healthier choice than a burger and fries (I still love 'em though).  I will definitely go back, and I recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"It's always nice to come in and see new specials at every Rubios location. I am always greeted with prompt service and love that they deliver your food and greet you by name. The service is always fast as well, so it is easy to come in and eat in house during my lunch break. Jackson was particularly cordial during my visit today. About to dive into some smoky shrimp tacos.... yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! When come to Vegas come and enjoy great Mexican food! Their motto fresh, organic and no MSG or GMOs in their food! Beans are amazing!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for my husband saying the fish tacos were pretty good, this place would get no stars. I don't know how you can screw up a steak quesadilla but blah! Loads of chewy cheese. Gross meat. Pretty sure it was microwaved. Not a crisp part on it. I tasted my husbands beans and we both agreed they were gross. He said they tasted like KFC gravy lol. Totally overpriced and there was a ridiculous amount of dust actually hanging off of the tiki style hut in the middle. Husband says the Del Taco fish tacos are the way to go. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to get back for winters in Arizona. Stopped by Rubio's Mexican Grill yesterday and as usual, what a tasty treat ! I wish this chain would open up in Canada.
The staff smile & say they love their jobs. That says a lot about how a place is run.. Everything is freshly prepared to order. 
Love their salsa bar. The seasoning on their grilled chicken is outstanding and and their Grande Bowl ( my fave) was as usual, not only delicious but also nutritious. Consistently great !! 
We are regulars in winter."}
{"text":"Yeah it's another chain mexican type place but I'd say it's the best chain mexican type place out there.  I like this location for it's extra clean store and competent staff that didn't scowl, grunt, mumble or slouch while taking my order.

Lobster Burrito, $8.79, ugh, bad price, but great burrito, it's not all that big but it sure is tastey."}
{"text":"Just had another great experience at a Rubios, this one made all the better by the awesome lady taking our order - Gladys!!  She was very kind and like the great food, she makes us want to come back here again.  Tonight we were in a hurry, so we picked up a couple Cabo Plates and a Coastal Trio to go.   She was very careful to double check that each item in our order actually made it into our to-go bags before we left the restaurant (an important detail which other places often forget).  Now back in the car and on our way, just a quick pit stop to be cheered by kind people like Gladys and the freshest baja food around!  Hats off to this location; keep up the great work, Mr. Rivera!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I've experienced.  No one manning the front counter when we walk in. (Busy Saturday night).  However, because their backroom door was open I was able to see the staff just hanging out in the back.

When the staff finally get around to taking my order, the associate gets easily distracted and ignores me halfway through me relaying the order to her.  2 stars because at least the food was decent."}
{"text":"Best taquitos I've ever had! Fresh Mexican style food."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 2 stars because the food is good.  I overheard all the Hispanic employee talking down to another employee that was African American. They were talking bad about him and making fun of him because he didn't understand Spanish. He was asking for help of since he never did something alone and they were making fun of him because he didn't know how.   I felt sad for the kid.  I wish I had said something.  That's why I am saying something here."}
{"text":"Worst Rubio's I've ever been too, I can not wait for Sharky's wood fire grill  to open up down the street! My burrito was very small and was very dry, ordered sour cream on it and it was only on the bottom of the burrito. I contacted them as you requested."}
{"text":"The worse experience I've had here. I love Rubios. But on the night I walked in the restaurant was dirty to start with. It looked like they were starting to close down 30 minutes before. As i walked up to make a decision on what I was going to eat I could see 3 cooks in the back staring at me rolling there eyes. the lady at the register seemed rushed and said she could only do take out orders because she had to close by herself. So I order a salad bowl that was close to 12 dollars. As I was getting water and waiting for my food I heard the shift leader tell the cashier she better have everything closed up in an hour. Which I thought was rude for her to yell at her from the kitchen. So then I get my food. I went outside and eat because I didn't want to be in there way of closing down. I start eating my salad and when I went to dig for the quinoa it said it was suppose to have.... I go back in the restaurant and ask the shift leader.... I'm sorry but my salad doesn't have quinoa, she said \" oh we ran out\". And I said well I wish I knew so that I didn't order a 12 dollar salad with out some of the ingredients. So she said \" we noticed as we were making it \" so I'm thinking... are you serious...  so she didn't even apologize and said I'll give you a refund. And I was like okay sure. So I got my refund. The shift leader made my salad knowing there's was no quinoa to add and still sold it to me. That's a rip off. I still can't believe what she said to me. Never going back to this Rubios."}
{"text":"After the week I have had it was wonderful to come in and have such amazing customer service from a young man named Bryson. From the moment we walked into the door till we left he was wonderful not with just us but all the people who walked through there door. So glad we stopped in here tonight to have supper. Thank you Bryson"}
{"text":"On the urgent pressing of a sister, I grabbed some take out from Rubio's for a quick delicious bite. While I did get a bite in, my burrito was small enough to finish in two bites. Considering I am more man than just two bites, this place needs to step it up. They do give you chips to enjoy along with your burrito. However, I would rather have had a second burrito without the extra cost. At least with places like Chipotle, I feel as if I am partially full and not just running on empty.

Overall, the burrito was small, the taste was fine. If you want to get a great burrito sometime, head over to one of the many hundreds of other good Mexican restaurants and leave this one to rot away."}
{"text":"I saw a special on the food network about their fish tacos so I had to try them.  Well I must say that it was love at first bite.  I can't say anything about any other menu items as I only have eyes for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Rubios I love it I can eat all the time..really recommend my favorite food is shrimp tacos Mmmh Yummy"}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing!!! I've never had a bad meal at this location. These guys are the best! Love rubios"}
{"text":"As a general rule, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. For some reason, it seems that the vast majority of Mexican restaurants do not offer fish tacos on their menus. That's probably because it's harder to get it right compared to a chicken or carne asada taco. Fortunately, there is Rubio's. Its whole claim to fame is the original Baja-style fish taco and as far as I'm concerned, Rubio's makes one of the best. Crispy beer-battered fish is served with shredded cabbage, mild salsa, and a tangy white sauce in a flour or soft corn tortilla. It's just as delicious as it sounds, but it tastes better if you eat it right away before the batter has a chance to get soggy. On Fish Taco Tuesdays, the original fish taco is only $1.25 after 2:30pm.

We also enjoy their carnitas rajas taco with its tender and tasty pork. My wife often orders their balsamic and roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken. Their salsa bar has 3 different salsas: mild green, spicy red, and my favorite, the chipotle. For the health conscious, they offer a grilled Mahi Mahi version which is very tasty as well. Sure there are other items on their menu, but we typically stick with our favorites.

Rubio's is a great choice for an inexpensive meal that tastes good. With friendly and efficient counter service and surroundings that are clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for? If you join their \"Beach Club\" email list, they will send you coupons on a regular basis, including a free meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"Rubio's can be found in the shopping center at Eastern & Serene with the Ross' and Home Depot. It is the far south east corner near Papa Johns.

I love their fish taco's! The fish is Pollock that has been dipped in a beer batter and fried to perfection. I don't find it too oily at all. You can pick between corn or flour tortillas, I chose corn. The original is topped with cabbage, salsa and some white sauce.. cheese maybe? Not too sure what it is, but it is delicious! The Especial comes with gaucamole, onions & cilantro and cheese. The plate comes with a side of their \"no fried\" beans and chips. I changed out the beans for their side of rice. I found these sides to be kind of small in servings. My boyfriend added a side rice to his and it was only $.50, but it was small. You can also switch it out with black beans as well.

I found the establishment to be very clean. They have a salsa bar near the fountain drinks. They have 4 different salsas. Salsa verde, picante, mild salsa, and chipotle. They also had an onion/cilantro mixture, and of course pickled peppers & carrots (like robertos!)

Service is quick and they are very helpful. 

I haven't tried anything else yet, because I really like their world's famous fish tacos.. but they also have mahi and chili lime salmon and shrimp. They also have chicken and beef for all you non-seafood lovers out there. Their food is very fresh and their tortillas are pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Work lunch take out....they deserve a 5 star for having our order ready when we arrived and for them confirming all orders were correct. We were in and out in 5 minutes. Great job Rubios!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this Rubio's for years and have always loved it! However I just ordered a large order of guacamole, which I was told came in \"a 12oz bowl.\" When I received the order, the woman said she was sorry but she misspoke. No problem, misunderstandings happen all the time. However when I got home and saw the guac, there were 3 of the tiny cups they put the pinto beans in and they weren't even half full of guacamole! I probably could have fit the entire contents of my \"large\" order in one small cup! With that being said, besides today I have always had a great experience here and will continue to come here-- I just won't order any more guacamole."}
{"text":"I have nothing, but great things to say about this Rubio's! The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, quick ticket times, the bar is never empty, and the restaurant is always clean! (That includes; The dinning area, outside setting area, drink station, bar, and restrooms.) The managers are always onsite and are more then happy to assist you with any problems or concerns you may have. Their menu has something for everyone! Shrimp, fish, steak, salads, chicken, beans, rice, enchiladas, tacos, burritos, you name it!!! I recommend the shrimp enchiladas with green sauce, black beans and citrus rice. It's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best one I have been to and it's not because of the food I mean if you eat at rubios you already know it's good it's the actual people working often times you see a lot of people who are unhappy to be there but their manager BJ just seemed cool lol and if he isn't the manager someone should make him one"}
{"text":"Fish taco used to be great maybe it still is but quality had gone down i only like there fish taco of course its  the only one i order almost every Tuesday. i find it cheap and use to be good but i think people that work here doesn't like doing there job or offering real customer service.  you see i order at least ten or more tacos to go almost every Tuesday you know i can eat two or more plus love to share my food with family.  anyway i do find them this store and the eastern 215 one kinda deliberately messing with the my order either they don't like there there job or don't like people ordering multiple order.  see at eastern they had short me 2 tacos out of 12 tacos i ordered to see this really bum me out since i really don't wanna drive back from home i called them to let em know about it and they acted like they its nothing like they know about it. so i stop going at eastern, then on green valley on a different occasion i ordered 12 fish tacos to go and the lime on each 12 fish taco which was suppose to be a slice was cut to a quarter of the slice and sometimes less than that.That when you squish the lime nothing comes out. so i called back to find out what happens just want to know i was calm and willing to listen i ask for a manager his name is Mark to my amazement he knew about it and said since their is a shortage of lime in the US that they are currently cutting cost and they are only putting a little bit of lime in each of their tacos.  i was just laughing inside cause i kinda know this is bullshit.  Anyway what a crock of shit to give as a reason to a paying customer.  Well hope this manager was telling the the truth cause Karma is a bitch when it comes around.  I would like to go to  a restaurant that doesn't doesn't deliberately sabotage your order no matter how big or small it is.  its just plain common sense you treat people as you wanna be treated no matter what race or color just saying..."}
{"text":"Great friendly service every time, I recommend the ancho citrus shrimp burrito and the blackened mahi mahi fish taco. Solid visit every time I decide to stop by."}
{"text":"I agree with a prevous poster who says this Rubios is the best in the area. The employees are super friendly and nice. Between my kids and myself, we usually make tons of modifications:( hold this, add that etc.)...I always order the chipotle ranch chicken salad (minus chicken and cheese w/ dressing on the side)..they always take my order without batting an eyelash and ALWAYS get it right..my salad is always crisp and fresh and we probably take out from Rubios 3 times a month..."}
{"text":"I'm not going to review this place again unless I have a bad experience. 
Great service, very good food, love the salsa bar a lot! 
I did the coastal trio again and it was consistent with last time! :) Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a great little place. We can argue for days about Authentic or not....Who cares? 
The Food is fresh and yummy! Not too much salt or grease and everything seems to be made to order. 
I went for the Coastal Trio which was Fish Taco, Shrimp Taco, Tilapia Taco! All were great and loaded with fresh ingredients. If I had to nit-pick the tortilla could've been a little softer, but it held together great! 
Salsa bar was amazing with something for everyone. I think 6-7 types to choose from. 
This is a very nice place that I will certainly visit again! 
If you like Seafood Tacos/Burritos, give this place a try. Don't let the Commercialized Type Presence scare you away, its very good food!"}
{"text":"Seriously! Best Fish Taco next to Mexico!
I would give one more star if the service was little better...."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch rush was crazy busy. Ricardo,assumingely the manager, was excellent!! Ensuring food was getting out quick, the tables were cleaned, and offering to bring silverware and napkins as he delivered food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here today for dinner and got the Cilantro Lime Salmon Burrito and Blackened Ono Burrito. They were both appropriate sized burritos (not gigantic like Chipotle's) and the fish was cooked to order. Both were more delicious than we expected--especially since they came with guacamole. We are locals so we come here often and their fish items on the menu never disappoint. 4 stars because the chips were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from the East Coast, I wanted to savor some authentic West Coast fish tacos.  When I asked where I could find the best, I was pointed to Rubio's. Wow!  I knew with my first bite that I had found heaven!  I had the Original and my hubby had the Especial.  Both were very yummy!  If you're looking for great fish tacos, look no further than Rubio's. 

The service was great, the restaurant was clean, parking was easily accessible, and the prices were very reasonable. Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"when it comes to fast food that tastes good, too.  rubio's is a great catch  absolutely love the blackened talapita taco.  it's a reel keeper!.
the employees are always pleasant and e-fish-nt.
i'm hooked."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Always really clean! Love the salsa bar. The tomatillo salsa is my favorite. Street tacos and the baja chicken burrito are excellent!"}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly and their food is the best!! I would recommend everyone come try. Fish taco is soo good and Tuesday after 230 they are super cheap"}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are small. The price seems a bit high for the quantity of food that they give you."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome here I've been coming to this rubios for at least a decade.I've nevee had a compliant tell today me and some friends order the regular everything was delicious. But I have to complaint about the manager.he was just a prick from the beginning we walked in didn't get a hello nothing.as he was taking the order he just had a rude tine about everything. Even tords a customer that was getting some salsa and as one of the employees from the bavk came out ready to clock out he proceeded to talk shit to her she left he walked in the back making sure to talk shit as loud as he could for everyone to here.it made me so uncomfortable we had to leave and box everything up.its just sad to see how rude ppl are to there employees.special in front of customers"}
{"text":"Very friendly workers who are knowledgable.  The food is made fresh to order and feels healthy when you eat it!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your fix of great fish tacos, fish burritos and shrimp salads. It was relatively inexpensive too ... $26 for 3 of us."}
{"text":"I love the taste and quality of the food at Rubios. However, this location my husband and I have been to 4 times and EVERY VISIT they have MESSED up the order!  The good thing is they are apologetic and remake it, but this last time they messed it up even after taking it back.  

The receipt will say the right thing, but the person actually making the food will do different.  1. Did flour instead of corn tortillas 2. Putting on sauces that we asked for not to be on the food 3. Chicken instead of steak. 

The food is good, and they were nice, and sorry for their mistakes, but the time & wait is not worth it. We will not return to this location, but will go to other locations."}
{"text":"Took my 85 year old dad to Rubios for the first time.  The food was excellent , as always.  My dad took a lonnngggg time to look at the menu and order.  Luckily, we went at a slow time and weren't holding up the line.  Our server was a teenaged girl.  She was so kind and patient while waiting for him to order.  Thank you for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients cooked and served warm.

I liked their soft shell shrimp tacos,
and the new bbq Carnita(sp?) tacos.
I liked the texture, seasoning, temperature, harmony of the flavors.

I tried the chopped chicken ranch salad before,
it wasn't too exciting and way over-dressed.

The chips and salsa weren't too great.

I like the interior decoration here."}
{"text":"I walk in to this location to grab some lunch with my husband. We did not get a Hi, Hello, I'll take your order when we first walked in. The blonde girl at the counter could not take to time to look up at us. After I ordered my Tacos my husband proceeded to order his food. The cashier said \"hold on I have to add all these details to all three tacos\". As if that was a huge problem for her. The manager came to the second register and yelled ill take whoever is next. Overall just poor customer service throughout my whole experience"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first (& last) time.  Bathroom was disgusting.  Told the counter person, who went & looked, & returned w excuses for why it should look like that.  YUK"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh and delicious! Had a 2-taco mix and match plate. I selected the mango habanero mahi mahi taco and pacific mahi mahi. The mango habanero was spicy, sweet and fantastic! Would have that again. The pacific mahi was a little bland but after adding tomatillo salsa it was good."}
{"text":"A friend from Arizona recommended Rubios to me, I was surprised it was a chain. I went at an odd time of the day so the service was great. I tried 3 different tacos and ALL THREE were delicious!!! I went to the salsa bar & got a few things to try but the tacos were so well made & seasoned the salsa went to waste.  My boyfriend tried it & loved it so we ate it three days in a row. I will stop at other Rubios in the future with a comforting  feeling when I'm in other cities & hungry."}
{"text":"I'm very confussed about all the good reviews about this place.I went last night, and has been the worst experience in a mexican-chain-fast food place i have ever had!
the food was more that awful. to the point i left feeling robbed and sad. i had the street tacos and the grande 'crap' salad. the worst ever! never going back. in my opinion bad as taco bell!"}
{"text":"Time for another round of excellent steak tacos!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos BAR NONE...now if they would just make the Oaxan shrimp a daily staple :)"}
{"text":"Clean fresh and the food is delightful! Gourmet shrimp tacos are great! The food is light and non-greasy which is def a plus! Oh and the diablo salsa is to die for!"}
{"text":"So many other great places to eat in this area- head to Milagros a few doors down for better service and better food... Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner with my mom on 8/28/13. The chicken nachos had a very long piece of black hair in them. She pulled it out right before my eyes. Totally repulsive. She called the restaurant & the guy offered to remake them. When she explained we lived about 30 minutes away and no one felt like eating chicken nachos anymore, not even an offer of a refund. Didn't even seem concerned that employees were sending out food with their hair in it! Gross!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is a great place for a quick, inexpensive meal.  I love the shrimp verde tacos, as well as the salmon tacos.  Tasty and filling!  This Rubio's has the friendliest staff!"}
{"text":"10/29/2016: The customer service and follow up from a Rubio's Executive that I received an email from is similar to the tacos that I received that lead to my review, not up to par by any means.



I'm usually satisfied with my Rubio to go orders, but tonight I was dissatisfied. First, my original fish tacos were prepared and packaged in a bulk style instead of individually wrapped with a lime. Second, the tacos were lacking in sauce and the cabbage was excessive. Before I left, I asked the young woman handing me my food, \"why were the tacos placed in meal containers?\" I was advised that the tacos are prepared in that manner because I ordered so many. I let her know that I've ordered 10-12 tacos previously and they were wrapped individually. I guess I missed the memo regarding the change."}
{"text":"I luv this to pick up on my way home form work. Fairly healthy and tasty. I like the fish tacos shrimp burrito and salmon burrito."}
{"text":"Ok the food is typically pretty good but i have a hard time paying $10-11 for fast food mexican."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and dirty tables. This used to be my go to place for the mahi mahi burrito but the last few times I've gone, the tables and salsa bar have been dirty and everything seems pricey for what you actually get."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at a rubios. The fish tacos are amazing. Along with with steak Baja bowl. All in all the service at this place is always quick and friendly. Try taco Tuesdays.."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Rubios is a Fast Food place, walked in, low and behold the Cashier walked away when it was my turn to order, the Girl who later replaced him either couldn't hear or understand me. Food came in a reasonable amount of time, and it looks good, $35 for Nachos 2 Drinks and 2 Burritos"}
{"text":"Haven't been to rubios  literally in years. Everyone is so patient and nice here food is great as well."}

{"text":"I like to come on Taco Tuesdays and pick up dinner for the family. The guys working up front are always super nice, order is always correct and food is  delicious .."}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale in October from Illinois where there aren't any Rubio's. I happened upon it by chance. I ordered a lobster burrito (a special) and my daughter nachos. The ingredients were really fresh. The only thing I would change next time I order the burrito is the sauce. I would ask for it on the side or not at all. There was way too much and took over the taste of the lobster. 

The location is relatively convenient. Prices are competitive to other fast food places with similar foods. I would go back."}
{"text":"Staff here is great. The owner is here often and is very nice and attentive. The food is always clean. This is our designated rubios!"}
{"text":"I went to rubies' 1st time and my order was made wrong customer in front of me was complaining they had been waiting 20 minutes to get there order finally asked for there money back . I never got a receipt or number and after get my food and having them have to remake it because it was wrong. I found out i was charged wrong 16 bucks for 3 taco's. she told me shrimp tocos are 4.99 each but that didn't seem right the menu said 8.49 for two al carte tacos no rice not beans no chips it was charged wrong and just wanted my 5 bucks back instead I was given back a dollar. It wasn't right i did the math on my phone and showed the cashier. I was over charged and instead of giving me my money back she gave me a card to eat free one time next time. I just wanted my 5 bucks but didn't get that bad 1st experience."}
{"text":"Food: excellent.

Service: excellent.

Available options: excellent.

Cleanliness: pretty dang good.

Tables and chairs leave much to be desired, but that's not the fault of the staff.

Overall, 10/10 recommend. I wish a Rubio's would open up where I live!"}

{"text":"I love Rubios fish tacos, closest thing to the real deal in baja...when I checked into the Monte Carlo, I was pleasantly surprised to see a Rubios there. Since this store was in Vegas and so far from the mother ship in southern California, I was a bit apprehensive. The prices are a bit higher than your stand alone restaurant...fish tacos here are 3.99...nonetheless I had to try some. Let me tell you, they were the best Rubios fish tacos I've had to date, and I've eaten at almost every one from San Diego to L.A...plus the fish was huge, I ordered 3 but should of stuck to two...my taste buds were telling me more,more,more, but my body was screaming for elastic...this store was great"}
{"text":"We have always gotten good food and great service at Rubio's. This time when we visited, we were not greeted when we came into the restaurant and there wasn't anyone else there. We ordered the shrimp tacos and a balsamic vinaigrette chicken salad.  We asked about ingredients in the Churro due to a dairy food allergy and the girl said, \"It's like a donut, no dairy\". Well, luckily I only had a few bites of it. Later that night, I looked it up on the website as I started having doubts she was very confident about the ingredients and I was having an allergic reaction. It looks like there IS milk in the Churro. For $18 for a meal, I can think of numerous other restaurants I would rather visit. The food quality and the service was not what I have experienced in the past. Nor was it worth $18 for a lunch."}
{"text":"super good tacos great taste"}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but today the burrito was tiny and dry.  4 stars for past visits and 0 for today.  Our regular rubios is in Casa Grande and way better."}

I also place one item on my order to be made later for to go and they actually listened and waited until i was almost finished with my  meal, made the to go item and brought it to my table just as i finished my meal. it was an excellent experience!!! clean atmosphere, great service and excellent hot fresh food! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Headed to Rubio's for the first time, and I was very pleased.

I ordered the California Bowl w/ chicken.  It was pretty good.  Would I eat it over Chipotle? No, but c'mon there's no \"fast food\" place that beats Chipotle.

The one thing that I LOVE about Rubio's is their salsa bar.  They had 6 different kinds of unlimited salsa!  I don't know about you, but when it comes to salsa, I'm a massive scooper not a petite little dipper.  I like as much salsa as possible with each bite and their unlimited selection suited my preferences perfectly, and the variety was great as well.

I'll definitely be back because it seems that they are more well known for their seafood dishes like fish tacos.  I'll head back and give those a whirl when I get some time."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast food. But did get my order wrong. Busy place but went through pretty fast. Great salsa."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Princess Ama here! 
So let me start by saying man was i wrong about this place!!! I honestly have the worst taste and didn't even realize it until cody made me eat rubio's OG fish tacos. great service, friendly staff, super fun and hot salsa bar (like me duh)! only thing that could make it better was a mariachi band and corona!"}
{"text":"Jackson was my cashier, and he was a wonderful and personable server! I was blown away by his sincerity and kind demeanor. What a wonderful way to start my Thanksgiving weekend! So many things to be thankful for this season. Especially great service!"}
{"text":"Food is so fresh and delicious. Had a salmon taco, an original fish taco and a steak street taco."}
{"text":"Ugh, had their \"world famous\" fish tacos.  Now I know why they're famous.  I got food poisoning.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Had a shrimp burrito came with chips and beans. Did not enjoy. Kids meal was terrible. Came with a corn taco and kids hated it. Wife had a shrimp salad and she said it was ok. For 33 buck definitely not worth it. Staff was friendly btw"}
{"text":"We eat at this Rubio's location at least once a week and it's always great. The food is consistently good and I've never once had a problem. The staff is also excellent - always friendly and helpful. They even remember my usual order - which is saying a lot. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant, fresh,  and tasty experience at Rubios. I have yet to find a fish taco better than Rubios. They have the best customer service. We don't hacer a Rubios in New Mexico, but it's always our first stop in AZ."}
{"text":"I've never had Rubios and wanted tacos. I didn't  know that fish tacos was their specialty. I had the steak \"street tacos.\" They seemed too lemony as if they were marinated in something sour. Not for me. Also the corn tortilla isn't what I'm used to, I like white corn and they use a thicker more yellow tortilla. Meh. The salsas also seemed sour. I guess this is Rubios thing, idk. I would go back to try the chicken and fish tacos or maybe the burritos.  But will NEVER again get the steak. Oh yeah, the churro was good."}
{"text":"Rude staff, water dispenser wasn't working and employee decided to accuse me of stealing refreshment in front of other customers. Place is dirty anyways, wouldn't recommend to anyone, as a common customer consider me a lost one."}
{"text":"Best Mexican place by far. Always my go-to when I'm feeling like a good Taco/burrito."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick taco or two and nothing is too expensive. The kids menu is great and it's also nice to sit, it's not exactly a sit down restaurant but it's also not fast food. However The Sandbar at desert ridge is more or a sit down type of place and they have a great bar! Highly recommend if you like \"Mexican grill\" type of food."}
{"text":"I was not happy with my meal at all and when I was told how much it cost I was really not happy. (someone else picked it up for me, I was somewhere else in the mall)
It was not fresh. If it was soft it was supposed to be crunchy and if it was crunchy it was supposed to be soft. Not a fan of the quality or the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in last weekend for a fish taco plate. The place was filthy, undermanned, and hot. I hope management will take corrective action,  or we will find a new place for one of our favorite meals."}
{"text":"This place was not good tonight for several reasons.  The batter on the fish tacos was three times the size of the fish, basically just eating greasy batter.  There was salsa all over the seating, really the interior needs a facelift.  The staff made a good attempt, especially the gentleman working, but overall the whole restaurant was off tonight.  They couldn't get the orders straight, even with numbers!   Needs improvement!!"}
{"text":"this is the only \"fast food\" i will eat, 
fish tacos are the best, (but must be eaten with in 5 minutes of cooking or soggy sets in)
street tacos are great too.
I will never move to another state where there are no Rubios
Baja fresh can go suck it, so can Texas for that matter...:)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to places. I haven't had a bad experience since going here. It's tasty and also affordable. Staff is friendly and love the ambience of the place. 

Also, if you're looking for a place to go to on Taco Tuesday, their original fish tacos are $1.75 if you come after 2:30pm. Very good as well."}
{"text":"This is the better Rubios in the valley.  Food is always  good and service  is great.  Was in there today for my
steak taco fix."}
{"text":"Love their salads! The balsamic and roasted veggie salad is my fav along w/ the California bowl!"}
{"text":"Only tried the fish tacos, but they were amazing. 
Perfectly fried and priced right. Good size and the white sauce is better than most. Happy hour on Tuesdays is your best bet. $1.50 fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Not only were our fish tacos simply delicious - but I want to compliment the manager or shift supervisor who was on duty on June 27, who graciously not only allowed us to order and take our food out when they were closing, but was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. He actually offered a sample of something I had mentioned I want to try. Really just love Customer Service like this."}
{"text":"The gourmet chicken tacos are the most amazing taco I have ever tried in my whole life!  Consistently delicious!  MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I have twice been to this location and received excellent customer service!  The young guy at the front recommended something on my first visit and I am hooked!  I went a second time less than 1 week later! I ordered the 2 enchilada special. ..1 chicken and 1 shrimp. The taste was great, even loved the rice and black beans. On the 2nd visit I decided to try a fish taco too. I am very happy with the food here and will go back often!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Rubios. All food is always fresh delicious. Best place for healthy alternatives quickly. Excellent service super friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing food . Salsa Verde shrimp tacos are my favorite, I can eat them everyday .  Another thing I like about them that my meal usually ready in a 3-5 minutes.   Manager/server Alfredo is always friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"Love Rubio's - great, fast, healthy food! This location consistently has the best customer service. It's clean, well maintained, the food looks good & tastes great. The manager, John, is friendly, attentive and is always busy doing something in the restaurant w/a smile on his face!"}
{"text":"I go to this Rubio's because it's convenient when I'm running my errands. They always have good food and good service. Today I witnessed one of my favorite servers, Sarah, get mistreated by a customer. Their idiotic rant during a busy time was totally inappropriate and definitely about their issues and had nothing to do with the server. This girl (Sarah) was working her fanny off for everyone in there. I hope that person never comes back but I always will. They are a fun crew and seem to enjoy their jobs."}
{"text":"Cool.  Fresh. Tasty!  Fantastic salsa bar to accompany really quality food for a decent price.  Quiet and clean with great service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Rubios! I eat here very often, have had tons of different employees and it's all been great! The 2 taco Gourmet chicken taco plate is my favorite and defintely a recommendation! I like to get it as a burrito sometimes  :) YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's and really love their chipotle  white sauce with hot hot hot sauce . I could have that sauce mix on anything at this restaurant and thoroughly enjoy the meal!"}
{"text":"I've been to this rubios three times and always had a great experience. Very friendly staff and great tacos with salsa!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's Original Fish Tacos.... I don't think you can beat them... the fish was very fresh in it (not fishy tasting).  Tried the Sangria and corn roasted guacamole for the first time and will have them again!!  For fast food fish tacos, THE BEST!!!!  And the manager was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"We picked up dinner here last night. It was fairly busy, $5 burrito night. The food was very slow to come out of the kitchen was very slow. I'm all for fresh food but 18 min for 2 burritos is a bit much. The staff was in no hurry at all. The kitchen staff spent more time looking into the dining area than preparing food. There was no urgency at all with lots of customers waiting around for food. For a pickup meal this was not the place to pick it up.
The burritos (Burriot especial with steak) were good, but definitely not great. I had to look to find the steak, or see if I could find any in my burrito. There was some steak but far less than their marketing would suggest. 
The tortilla chips were delicious and the highlight of the meal. 
Overall, I wasnt thrilled with the sercice or the meal. I'll stay with Chipotle next time."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Rubio's, it was delicious! The BF and I both ordered the fish taco special. The tacos came with a big piece of fish and lots of onion/cilantro, as well as guac and tomato salsa.

Something unique about this place is the salsa bar they have, it was fun trying the different kinds of salsa offered. They made the fish tacos even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Rubios is good,but this location is not the best. They need to get with the program. My food has been cold and when Rubios comes out with new items,they lag in getting that menu item. When rubios.com says a new menu item has arrived it should be on the menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, the food is great, but these guys go above and beyond, I didn't catch their names, but I genuinely appreciate the customer service! I guess you just don't expect such a welcoming environment at a place like this, but it was great!!!!

Mark is one of the guys that was extra helpful and pleasant!

Thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here the other day and it was decent. The staff was friendly and the food was adequate. I like that they have a salsa bar. I have been here a few times and it's always reasonably good, although some of the food tends to be a bit on the bland side, especially their veggie burrito. Before you say veggies are bland in general, if you're a good cook then you can make anything taste good so I don't wanna hear it. The fish tacos are good."}
{"text":"Love the fact they have a low carb wrap! I will forever drive by the \"Chip\" place I used to know so well..

Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I am usually a blackened tilapia and salsa verde shrimp taco girl w/black beans and a crap-ton (technical term) of salsa, but today's $1.50 Taco Tuesday called out to me in an I'm-too-lazy-to-cook-after-work moment. Plus, 2 tacos for $3?! Can't really beat that... though I'm adequately full after scarfing mine down, I stand by my regular choices. 

For your own sake, don't order the classic taco as take-out. Within 5 min, the wrapping makes any crispiness soggy. No bueno...but edible.
 
Verdict: Taco Tuesday rocks, but eat it in-house while super fresh. Otherwise, I still love my standards and they are great, even as take-out. If you are nice, they will give you a slightly larger container or two for the salsa (the spiciest and chipotle ones are my faves)."}
{"text":"Ordered my food, then about 5-10 minutes later the manager started apologizing for delay and warning customers that food might be further delayed. He communicated the delay but didn't give any timeframe. 20 minutes later, customers started getting food. I got a refund without an issue and the manager was very apologetic. Great manager but unfortunate situation that was very frustrating."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Went on a Tuesday night with the family. 
1st prob- running low on flour tortillas.  Really?  Shouldn't you be more prepared on a popular night?
So....I was told I couldn't have flour tortillas unless it was specifically on the menu.
2nd prob- I have a little one and ordered 1 steak taco- nothing else.  As with families with 2 young kids knows, it can be a challenge to get all your items ordered, paid for, and still keep track of everything.  My husband paid as I herded my kids to the booths.  He remarked that for several tacos, our bill shouldn't have been over $20.

The food arrived shortly, which was great, but my little one got a taco plate with 3 tacos (not what we ordered at all) and before we could say anything (the guy placed the food down and took off before we could say anything about our order) the little one got his mitts on the food and the bean dip, so we couldn't even have fixed that.  So now we were stuck with a meal for a little guy who couldn't eat more than one taco.

Ok, that's on us, but really?  No flour tortillas- I wish they had a sign out front warning me beforehand.  I would have turned around and left.  
Unfortunately once you're inside and in line you're kinds committed, especially when waiting with little kids."}
{"text":"When I go to Rubio's, I only have one menu item on my mind, the self proclaimed World Famous Fish Taco.  On rare occasions, I have foolishly strayed away from the fish taco in some misguided attempt at variety, and been disappointed.  I'm not trying to say that the other menu items aren't any good, it's just that the fish taco is what they are known for and what they do best.  They are balanced just right, corn tortilla with crispy fish, cabbage, sauce, lime and hot salsa (added from the salsa bar).  However, these babies have a short half-life and deteriorate quickly.  I do not recommend them for take out, and if you opt for the two taco plate, I would resist the urge to munch on the chips and pinto beans and devour those tacos while they are hot and fresh.

The service is always quick and friendly, and sets Rubio's apart from many order at the counter/take out restaurants.  They can be very busy around lunch time, but the manager and employees still ask how everything was while they clear your plates.  They really seem to care about the patron having a good meal."}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and flavorful!  For a chain restaurant its a favorite."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great sea food good customer service. I usually order to go and I primarily order the same thing they are prompt my orders don't take long at all. The crowd is friendly it's a  nice place with great food."}
{"text":"I went to the location near the mall and I literally saw one of the workers there pick his nose and seriously EAT IT. Later I found out that this employee was a manager named Daniel. I'll NEVER be back to any of their locations EVER. That is completely unexceptionable."}
{"text":"I normally go to a different location but I was closer to this one, not thinking it would be a big deal.... I was wrong. I literally saw one of the workers there use his two figures to pick his nose and seriously EAT IT. Are you kidding me??? Later I found out that this employee was a manager named Daniel. I can't believe they have someone working there that would pick his nose, let alone a manager. I have to say I wasn't fully surprised... His hygiene was noticeably crap. I'll NEVER be back to any of their locations EVER"}
{"text":"Just so everyone that eats here knows... I went to the location near the mall and I literally saw one of the workers there use his two figures to pick his nose and seriously EAT IT. Are you kidding me??? Later I found out that this employee was a manager named Daniel. I can't believe they have someone working there that would pick his nose, let alone a manager. I have to say I wasn't fully surprised... His hygiene was noticeably crap. I'll NEVER be back to any of their locations EVER. That is completely unexceptionable."}
{"text":"I eat here often. I love the Cabo plate which had a fish taco, shrimp burrito, chips & beans. Great salsa bar. Awesome fish taco is crunchy & tasty. Burrito is amazing. Service is always amazing."}
{"text":"This is actually my first time at this location. Their customer service was absolutely top notch and I love their salsa!"}
{"text":"I prefer to go to (and review) the mom and pop restaurants in this price range but I have to say something about the reinvented rubios. 
I used to eat there because the kids really like their bean and cheese burritos but I always went grudgingly. 
However - times have changed! Rubios has introduced several gourmet options over the past several months and have hit a home run. 
Their new mahi mahi tacos, tilapia tacos and salmon tacos taste as fresh as restaurants that charge twice as much. Moreover, the portion sizes are borderline ridiculous. I force myself to eat three tacos every time I'm there because I like them all so much and can't decide which tastes best. (Also, if you order as a coastal trio- even with the price upgrade- the meal is $9.99). I defy anyone to have a fish centric lunch or dinner  that tastes anywhere near as good with as large a portions for the price. 
I am totally impressed. 
I did not mention the gourmet shrimp tacos, but probably should. They are also excellent and worth a visit. 
My only concern is that given the price point, they will either reduce the portion sizes or the quality of fish they are buying or both. Until then I'll be visiting a lot."}
{"text":"I have their shrimp burrito that used to be stuffed with shrimp and now I don't know what they did but it barely had any shrimp at all in it. I don't know if I'm ever going to come back there again unless they increased the amount of shrimp I mean I paid almost $9 for a burrito with maybe one and a half ounces of shrimp. for that reason I'm giving it 3 stars maybe I will give another location of better another try. But as of right now I won't be coming back there and Order and that burrito"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Friendly, courteous employees.  Walk in, order food, wait a few minutes and then get warm good food.  How friggin hard for other Goodyear restaurants to understand this simple business model.  Don't have to put up with all the stupid birthday singing either."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Rubio's before. It was great! Fish taco was hot and delicious. The Manager guy had a customer problem up front while I was there and I thought he did a great job of resolving it.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Freaking terrible! Last time I come to this location. I will drive to the 59th location. I will literally go out of my way, but some how get home faster. New record. For their poor service... 30 minutes for one single dish!"}
{"text":"I love love love Rubios!! The food taste fresh and is always great. I usually get the chicken tortilla soup with a health mex chicken taco. The soup is loaded up with chicken, cheese, pico de gallo, rice, avocado on top along with chips and lots of tasty flavors!! The chicken tacos are by far the best tacos.... well I guess that not fair to say because I have never tried any other taco because the chicken tacos are that good!!!!  If you like fresh inexpensive mexican style food then you will absolutly love Rubios!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a year and I feel I must make up for lost time by gobbling up as many delicious tacos as possible! Hehe. They specialize in fish tacos but every taco I've tried has been packed with flavor and vibrance. Their shrimp tacos are packed with juicy, lightly charred shrimp and a delicious creamy Baja style sauce. The verde shrimp tacos come with ripe buttery slices of avocado and the verde sauce adds a citrusy fresh note that really is something I could eat everyday. Their pride and joy, the fish taco was lightly coated in a flavorful, light, mildly airy batter that is a bit greasy but sinfully good.  They also have a special steak taco with bacon and crisped cheese, yum!They're decently priced for quality and offer a nice salsa bar that makes it fun to experiment with adding different tastes from smokey chipotle to classic verde. This place is a keeper in my take out rotation."}
{"text":"Ashley was prompt and took my order quick, the Fish Burrito was excellent! I was in and out in less than 5 Minutes Thanks Ashley!!"}
{"text":"I have been at this location 10 times or more and normally would give 5 stars but their service hasn't been very good the past few visits.  On this visit my food sat on the counter for more than 10 mins as I watched an employee walk by it several times making no attempt to bag it.  It took me saying something to get them moving.   Food was cold when I got it.  Hopefully they fix the service issue because I love Rubios"}
{"text":"Decent, gringoized Mexican fare served in a clean establishment. Perfectly edible, but for my money, I prefer to go to a real Mexican joint, of which there are many around here. This is the place to take your midwestern parents who think they like Mexican food but really don't have a clue. Last time I tried the place they had discontinued the non-fried fish tacos, which had IMO been the best food in the place.  Too bad."}
{"text":"This was our first time. It was very busy and noisy. The food was ok it just felt like it had already been cooked and was just waiting to be eaten. The floor was really slippery, I was afraid I was going to fall the whole time I was there. We would probably go back and try it again."}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome. Everyone genuinely cares about each customer that comes in. I came in for the food. I'm coming back for the service! It's always very clean inside with plenty of parking. Great job Rubios. Acknowledge this staff!"}
{"text":"Great food great service, but I do recommend more options for people who don't eat meat or dairy!"}
{"text":"I usually order for pick-up. Super nice customer service. I'm a big fan of their burritos, especially the grilled mahi burrito on whole grain and beer battered fish burrito (pretty much 3 fish tacos transformed into a missile). I always request for red enchilada sauce inside (for free!!!!), it really makes this little piece of carb-loaded goodness into something you can only imagine tasting in your dreams. This location has a really clean salsa bar. I appreciate that the cooks take the time to grill stuff their burritos, gives it that textural differentiation. Fish is moist, veggies taste fresh. How I eat my fish burrito: the first bite, you have to make enough room to pour salsa picante and verde for the second bite, finally you reach flavor town on your second bite, on your third bite, the oozing white cream and dark earthy tones of that enchilada sauce transports you to a little third-world village in Mexico. My last bite, I was sad, because I wanted another."}
{"text":"Very well worth it to go here. Everything is fresh. Staff are fast and friendly. Went here for my free bday coupon meal. Love the food unfortunately there was a skanky lady dress in short short that almost made me puke. Ladies if your clothes don't cover everything appropriately then perhaps you shouldn't wear it. Nobody wants to ruin their meal looking at your grossness.  Guess a lot of females can't be called a lady. But hey great staff at this location"}
{"text":"Fish tacos $1.50 on taco Tuesday is amazing!  Thats all I really have eaten here.    But even when it's not Tuesday. I like the fish tacos still.  They give you chips and bean dip with it when you order the plate.  Yummy.

The only complaints I have,

The staff can be somewhat rude and almost pissed off looking.      

They need to seriously move the fountain drink seperste from the salsa bar/topping bar.    People literally climb over one another and its really annoying.   
Plus some of the tables are so close to one another when it's packed. You can't even get out unless you're anorexic or something.      Other than that it should be 5 star but those things really bother me."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Rubio's to go to with my fiancé and friends. We have a pleasant experience every time. It's always clean, and everyone who works at this location is very friendly and helpful. Shout-out to Mark - I really like that he checks to make sure each customer is satisfied with their meal. He even brought me a new California bowl when my fiancé mistakingly ordered me the wrong one. I really appreciated that he went above and beyond to make sure that I loved my food. A great experience is everything, and we will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Rubio's throughout the valley and this one consistently has the best service. I told the servers that the syrup was out on the soda and it was fixed in less than 5 minutes. The servers always have a smile on their faces and are quick to bring out our food. I love returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I only go on Tuesday for $1.25 Fish Taco night and they are yummy!   Where can you have dinner so cheap, besides Costco's hot dog and drink?"}
{"text":"Last time I was there is smelled like sewer so had to eat outside.   The food is the same at any other Rubio's, but they should fix what ever was the problem with the smell."}
{"text":"Not always the fastest service, but everybody always seems in a good mood and pleasant to deal with.  They have really good iced tea and I like their little salsa bar.  Taco Tuesday's is great if you like their standard fish taco!!!!  Thanks"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for delicious shrimp tacos or fish tacos or a big burrito filled with lobster, and you are also standing in the middle of the mall food court, then I have wonderful news for you, because look around you big dongus, you're standing right by Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill and it is THE place to go to get the aforementioned food items.

Don't get me wrong, you're still at the mall foodcourt, but this is pretty much the real deal as far as Rubio's goes, and it's gonna be delicious. It takes a little longer than Panda Express or the pizza joint but that's because they're making the food fresh and not just serving you something that's been hanging out under heat lights. As soon as you put the food into your mouth hole you are going to taste the difference, and it is delicious.

Best thing about Rubio's? You can eat it and afterwards you don't feel like dying. Just don't order too much, you big hog, and you'll be energized and ready to go back into the depths of the mall and do more shopping or whatever it was you were up to. That's because fresh seafood is good for you, and Rubio's has it, so get to eating already what are you wasting time for?!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and found Rubio's because we were new to the area and were looking for a good Mexican place.  This was not it.  But... it's still amazing.

It's a chain, and a fast-food joint, so don't expect something else, but their food is really pretty spectacular for the price.  They have a bar full of different salsas and lemon slices and lime slices which is nice to add to your meal, but the food itself is really fresh and healthy-feeling.  I don't know if it's actually healthy because I'm not a doctor but I can tell you it 'feels' healthy.

I recommend the shrimp tacos.  Delicious.  That's all I can say.

Finally, another reviewer (Michelle N.) said there's a drive thru here.  There isn't."}
{"text":"I probably eat here about once per week (sometimes more). The Salsa Verde Shrimp Tacos are one of my all time favorite dishes from any casual dining restaurant. Also, the place is always clean, and staff is friendly. Food comes out quickly, and seems to be pretty high quality for the price. They have a decent salsa bar, and always have fun seasonal menu items to try."}
{"text":"Of course if they claim to have the best fish tacos-I had to try them. I liked the fish, nice large pieces, deep fried, not too heavy on the batter. Although I found the tacos a bit dry, and I didn't think their sauce was anything special-but at least they had sauce! I asked for just the tacos and they charged me and gave me the entire meal, therefore only three stars...and my search for awesome fish tacos continues."}
{"text":"I ordered a salmon taco which was delicious but very small. Seriously, three bites and it was finished for $4 dollars! Not a good value. 
I spoke to the manager and he said that they keep on raising their prices. Too bad. Rubio's once was a good value. Sadly, that's no longer true."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty, you would think grown folk could pick up after themselves in the bathroom
I had the surf n turf, tacos =lobster and steak 8.99 
Pretty good :) 
Kids are very nice at the front counter, good job parents!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times in the past few months. Never had had Rubios. Now I crave their blackened Tilapia tacos.. Soooo good!!! Their chicken burrito is very good as well. Not so crazy about the Mexican Rice. Staff are super friendly.. The online reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is I think the portions are too small for what you pay., anyways foods Deelish!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a chain outta So-Cal. 
Yeah it's kinda similar to Baja Fresh. 

But the original fish tacos rock. 
Perfectly fried- beer battered fish. Fresh cabbage. And the white sauce is amazing. 

Beans, rice and salsa are good too. And the staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to review chain restaurants but Rubio's is probably the tastiest place in the Monte Carlo. We ate here after walking out of the lousy ramen joint they have here. Yes, it's cafeteria food basically but they knock it out of the park. The fish tacos were on point and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, but after watching undercover boss, I've been wanting to try something from Rubio's!
Nice selection of tacos, fish tacos, burritos, and salads. It was neat to see the wrap for my burrito be freshly made. Decent amount of stuffing inside, could use more chicken(or steak, whichever you order). The size is  decent as well for under 10$ 
But it might have cost more because it was at a station casino.
The fish tacos took some time to cook, but it wasn't too long of a wait.
Rubio's a good place to grab some quick lunch, but it definitely has competition compared to Baja fresh and Chipotle."}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos on corn tortillas!!! Amazing with a Carona! But in the last year I have developed issues with corn that are really unpleasant. So I stopped eat corn. My husband begged to go here, I gave in thinking I would just get a bean burrito and let him be happy- he likes the lobster burrito. But the had grilled mahi-Mahi tacos on flour tortillas. I confirmed with the girl at the register they were on flour because I cannot eat corn. She made sure they were put on flour checked with the cooks to make sure no corn or corn meal would be used and suggested I swap the chips that come with the meal for rice. I was pleasantly surprised at her attentiveness to my needs and how she made me feel welcome despite my issues. I'm excited to add another place I can eat back on my list!!!! And the mango salsa was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Got some shrimp tacos when I was in town for a softball tournament they were excellent!!! The service was great as always, I'll definitely visit here again on my next trip. =^..^="}
{"text":"My visit today was off. The food was okay but nothing special. I had a cheese enchiladas,  chicken taco, and a side of beans. I really enjoy the salsa bar, it was fresh and good. They has a cashier who was being trained so I had to go my order twice, otherwise the service was good.

Now the reason I'm writing this review is while I was waiting for my order I was watching this young man in the food preparation area wearing gloves and a visor. I observed him at least three times remove his visor and mess with his hair in the food preparation area with the gloves on. He never moved away from the preparation area while doing this or change the gloves. Why even wear the gloves?"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and burritos. I go here especially to have the the shrimp tacos and burritos. Shrimp tacos and burritos are those where you dont get in every taco or burrito place. I am so happy that Rubio's makes these."}
{"text":"I was there last week, ordered the chicken tacos; 2 tacos for $2.99 (total cost). The tacos are topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and a sauce. I asked that they add sour cream to them. I was not advised that this would be an extra cost although I figured it would be. What I did not realize was that I would be charged 95 cents PER TACO to add sour cream. So 2 tacos = $2.99, adding sour cream to said tacos is an additional $1.90?? How does that make sense. When I contacted the cashier about it, he said that it was their policy to charge per item and there was nothing he could do about it. I get charging per order...What a complete scam. I have been eating at Rubios in various states and locations for years. But after this I won't be back. What a bunch of greedy idiots..I mean really $1.90 for sour cream (less than a teaspoon per taco) when you get two fully loaded tacos for $2.99?!?!?! Such a rip off!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and Moni has the best customer service skills! She recommended combos I wouldn't of normally ordered. It was amazing! I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with the original fish taco. We also had a shrimp taco which was absolutely delicious. They seemed a little short staffed but soon after we were served a man came in to pick up 3 large carryout totes; must have been why we waited a little longer than normal. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"30 minutes wait! Omg this is fast food? Give me a refund not a discount coupon for future visit...UPDATE refund given. Still don't have food though"}
{"text":"We love this Rubio's. The food is quick, awesome and have yet to encounter a mean or unhappy staff member. We went last night and somehow our order was lost in the back. My husband and I were enjoying our time together waiting for our food when we realized we had been waiting 30 minutes and people behind us had been served. I asked the manager and she was so kind and apologetic. She made sure our food was made ASAP and gave us coupons for 2 free meals. She really didn't need to but it was so nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp tacos!  However the gentleman behind the counter who is the Gringo who speaks Spanish to the staff. Your customer service is flawless but your tone and delivery to your staff is condescending and rude in Spanish, and believe me they notice it!  Be warned, there are other Gringos who are bilingual like myself (interpreter/translator).  Use of the reflexive command form in Spanish is dangerous!  It can make you sound like you are yelling or treating people like dogs if you are not careful"}
{"text":"I don't understand the obsession with this place. I've been here a few times with friends because I love Mexican food and keep hoping something will change, but each time bitter disappointment is left. 

Issue #1: Flies. The first time I came here with my family there was a dead fly chilling nonchalantly on the salsa bar. I hate flies. They are disgusting. So I composed myself, went to my table, and calmly told my family we would not be getting any salsa with our food that day.

Issue #2: Cleanliness. This is directly related to the above issue, but the whole store looked unkempt. Floors were sticky, tables left a mess, and the bathroom was gross. Not the kind of environment I want to try and enjoy my food in.

Issue #2: The food. I have gotten the cheese enchiladas, and they had a weird after-taste to them, like eggs. The corn tortilla was somehow someway spongy, and it had little flavor. My mother who loves Mexican food as much as I do also complained her meal was tasteless. I can tell they use the corn tortillas you cook before you serve (like the ones at Costco) and I do like the way they cook their cheese on the griddle so it's crispy in the tacos, but overall there's an off taste to the food. 

Issue #3: Price. It's more expensive than Costa Vida and isn't delicious like Costa Vida. That's a problem. 

Issue #4: This is perhaps the most grievous of them all for a Mexican restaurant and it is their salsa. Aside from the torment that was finding a dead fly by the salsa bar, when I returned at a later time I decided to overcome that tragic memory by trying every single salsa offered. The first one, the roasted salsa, tasted like a burnt black bean. That is the most accurate way I can describe it. The second one, the verde, reminded me of cilantro mixed with dirty dish water. Don't ask me why. It just did. Like it had a weird soapy after taste. The third salsa was just bad. It was the mild, and I got the same weird cilantro flavor plus pungent tomato puree. No bueno. The fourth salsa, the Chipotle, was the only one I could finish. It resembled a mixture of salsa and BBQ sauce that was actually pretty good. But really, only 1/4 of the salsas being edible, in my opinion, is a little on the sad side.

That is the end of my rant for this place. I could've been harsh and I apologize because some people do seem to really enjoy their food! I am not one of the people, however, so if you tend to relate to my reviews, beware."}
{"text":"A delicious healthier version of Mexican food! Best pinto beans in town!"}
{"text":"This is a good location of the chain, with nice employees, clean store, and dependable food quality. My only qualm is the somewhat slow service of food compared to other locations. Some days it's taken over 8-10 minutes for a salad when other times it was only 5 minutes. 

Despite this, the employees are generally knowledgable and affable. Sometimes they are a little uncomfortable in waiting for your order (as many times the customer may not know what they want immediately when they arrive), but this is more of a personal preference than it is an objective recommendation of an issue."}
{"text":"Rubios. You already know what your getting (the fish tacos) and since Jennie and I split the meal I ordered a side of chips .79cents extra ( I seriously was only given a half a bag.  Sorry Rubios I did not realize you might have to lay off an employee if you gave me a full bag. )"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the customer service is absolutely horrible! 
And the pricing can be better"}
{"text":"I usually get the cheese quesadilla at least once every two weeks. The quality at this particular Rubio's is outstanding. The food is consistently good. Everyone is really nice there too."}
{"text":"Great food!  The service was just ok.  The restaurant was a little dirty, but the food made up for it.  Shrimp tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the new tilapia burrito. Fish tacos and salsas are always fresh and delicious as well"}
{"text":"Really?  Did I eat at the same place as my fellow reviewers?  Did I order the wrong items?  Or maybe I just totally disagree with most of the other reviews...yeah, I think that's it.  The place was pretty clean.  The staff was polite.  The food was kind of gross...not nasty disgusting gross but geez..this food tastes like cardboard gross.  I ate here a second time because I figured everyone deserves a second chance, right?  Wrong."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey for the amount you get. A taco plate with 2 tacos is $12+. Other than that good service and clean restaurant. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Price was right, I had the Vegetable burrito........oh my, it was Huge! Did I mention was big.... The salsa bar must have had 10 choices...  Excellent for a healthier option for fast food!  Wished we had one in central California."}
{"text":"Super clean all the employees are great!! Best fast food Mexican food Around not greasy which is a plus and the salsa is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican fast food with sustainable seafood tacos, enchiladas, and burritos.  The shrimp enchiladas and tacos are actually pretty good (the shrimp isn't over cooked).  Tuesdays, their fish tacos are half price for $1.50.  Pretty good deals and economical for those on a budget.  Highly recommend and hands down, much better than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place is  really great at bringing what they are. Mexican food. I adore their fish taco especial with wild Alaskan pollock lettuce ,guacamole, cheese, their special sauce ,onions, cilantro, cabbage, and mild salsa ."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's. However, the employees at this location have NO IDEA what customer service is. We walk in and the guy at the counter is on his phone. He finally takes our order, and just as we were paying for it, another employee comes up behind him and tells him, \"dude, we're closed,\" and cancels our order. Really? They had not locked any of the doors yet, and if they are going to leave the doors unlocked for customers, they'd better be serving food. I don't care if they've \"put the food away.\" This was absolutely THE worst customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. They grande bowl works well for my resolve to avoid carbs. I always it minus the sour cream, rice or chipotle sauce but its still very good.
What I loved was the fact that on my visit this weekend the person taking my order was super nice. She not only made sure that I got the right order but double checked by letting me know each of the other ingredients in the bowl. She even offered to give me extra veggies since I was not having some of the ingredients.

Oh - and I did not know, they have a catering menu as well!

Its the great service that makes me go back everytime, even though there is another Rubio's close to where I live!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Rubio's for about 4 years now and it's a great place to get lunch. They are quick and really nice. I do wish they wouldn't have gotten rid of the sliced jalapenos though, it a huge pain to use their forks and knifes and cut up the whole ones and they don't fit in the to-go containers."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  I have frequented this Rubio's for years.  

On my last visit there ever, I  watched every second of the near Halloween horror:  my carry out order was brought to another table, to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in.  When the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out, they said they didn't care.  

I watched them open the carry out boxes.  I watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter.  I watched them take a bite from the boxes.  I watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter.  

I WATCHED IN HORROR AS HE RAN OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE WRONG ORDER, AND HE CLOSED  THEIR BOXES AND BROUGHT THEM TO MY TABLE AND HANDED THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was.....horrified.  I was in shock.  I said:  um, I'm not taking that if they put stuff on it, and I know they put stuff on it and took a bite.  
 
The counter guy opened up the box and said, I don't see any stuff on it.  it is fine.
He closed the box and handed it back to me.  
 
Another customer walked passed me and I glanced at him in horror, hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy.  He stared back at me with no emotion.
 
I turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it.  He says, I don't see that they put anything on it.  It's fine.  And he laughed.  It doesn't matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny, but it was NOT funny.
 
I walk out of the store DAZED and IN SHOCK with the two boxes.  
 
Never in my life, even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have I blatantly experienced anything like this.
 
When I got home, I opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking I would give it to my dogs;  and there was a foot long hair EMBEDDED across both tacos which I slowly pulled out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! 
 
I can not even make this S*IT UP!!!!!!!
 
I will never, ever go back there ever again.  Good luck suckers.  I hope you take your Cipro. You get what you pay for.   Never ever again.  
 
The only plus was that it was free taco weekend, and the counter guy gave me a free taco, which I threw away after gagging pulling out the embedded hair.  
 
For years, the service was friendly and excellent.  What happened?  :(
 
I'm on my way to Baja Loco."}
{"text":"First, my credentials, briefly: I'm a native New Jerseyan but travel the nation for work  When I first heard \"fish taco\" from a co-worker from L.A., I thought, \"Disgusting!\"  Then on vacation I tried one at the behest of a friend in Pacific Beach (San Diego).  I was changed forever.  But, the bar was set high.

Thankfully, Rubio's is an authentic fish taco maker.  It is a chain, and is similar to Baja Fresh and other \"Fresh Mex grills\", but with one glaring exception, and that is their fish taco.  The others make fish tacos, but Rubio's has mastered the art.

Having a Rubio's so conveniently located in the food court at the Monte has made one of my more well-liked casinos to become a preferred casino.  The routine is that I go in the back, right to the food court, have a DELICIOUS taco dinner (2 fish and one \"street\" taco, with some fresh salsas, and a soda to wash it down), and then hit their casino for some great gambling at lower minimums than most of the strip.

But the food is a no-brainer.  Inexpensive, easy, quick (relatively), and ever so delicious, the Rubio's at the Monte Carlo is one that I visit several times on each trip I make to Las Vegas.  So well worth it."}
{"text":"We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!

Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional. 

My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!

This is what Rubios is about!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are the best. The food takes a little bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. This week I picked up take out after a bad day and James, I believe he is the manager, was so kind and upbeat - really appreciated his positive attitude."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Rubio's for the past few years and it use to be good; however, last night my husband and I decided to stop by before our drive back to Utah and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  It was the first time we have ever experienced such terrible food at a Rubio's ... we were very surprised.  The food was not hot and not fresh.  Typically Rubio's has a fresh menu but this one was so bad we will never go back... we will drive to a different, less convenient location, but get something edible for $24"}
{"text":"First time here & I'll definitely be back! Fish tacos were fresh and tasty. The salsa bar has a good selection of salsas, and the guacamole is fantastic! The staff was fast friendly & helpful!"}
{"text":"Not the best Rubio's location I've been to but it'll do.  I always get a HealthMex Ono or  Mahi Mahi burito and have not been disappointed.  They cook the fish to order so it does take a while."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick meal or pick up dinner or your way home.  It's fast, not too expensive, and the good tastes good."}
{"text":"Far from authentic but fish taco Tuesdays is money well spent. Especially since their only $1.25. I usually get about 4 fish taco's on flour tortilla's with extra onions. I pour on their delicious hot salsa from the 4 option salsa bar and go to town. I have tasted their specialty shrimp burrito's and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it more often. For now, my wallet thanks me."}
{"text":"Always clean, quick and consistent.  Great value fast food that is restaurant quality."}
{"text":"so the blonde worker alissa needed to take a \"j break\" for those of you who don't know what that is, it is when someone NEEDS to stop what they are doing and in this case, go to the bathroom to take a hit of their electronic cigarette. then she stayed ther to feel the wonderful buzz that you get from this device called a juul and then came back inside to tell her co worker how she can't wait to get off work to go buy a pack of more pods (the thing that hold the nicotine). then she said she was gonna go wipe off the tables and as we were leaving she is hitting the juul right in front of her costumers. not classy"}
{"text":"Rubio's never lets me down. I'm never going to give it up. Multiple things on the menu are really good! I'm a little biased, I can't lie"}
{"text":"i ordered 2 items through an online delivery service , one blackened salmon bowl which was excellent. the other one was so called \"Chicken Quesadillas\". it barely had any cheese and only few pieces of chicken so i basically spent $8+  for one plain tortilla.  (check the image ) to see what i am talking about ."}
{"text":"I'm here way too often, more than I'd like to admit.

My boyfriend and I love the food. We love the staff.

It's not always easy taking our picky a** orders. And, they always get them right with a smile.

Not too long ago we were by the location on Ray Rd.
We decided not to go just because we love this location far too much to \"cheat\".

We're always at comfort here and leave with a satisfied tummy."}
{"text":"UPDATE: They refunded us for the tacos after the original review posted. Thank you! The way an organization reacts to complaints says a lot, and I am so relieved that someone (Lucas?) heard my compliant, was willing to be held accountable, and cares about improving my customer experience. Thanks for keeping the Rubio's brand as one of my favorites :)."}
{"text":"I love its place,I'm eating almost every week and every time delicious never haven't  problems with my order...it's my favorite place....thanks guys..."}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes tonight for 2 burritos and 1 taco... Talk about ridiculous. Staff seemed very disorganized And made no effort to correct the situation. I had to ask on the status of my food and correct it when it was missing parts. Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!! Really 35 min to make a flippin' burrito?? Also you might want to teach your staff about hygene. We watched this kid take out the trash and than run to kitchen to help. EWWWW!"}
{"text":"This place is ran sooo smoothly. No matter how busy or slow, employees are super friendly and patient. Daniel (i think) is truly a delight. I love that I can have a beer while i wait. Although, I never finish it before my food pops up. Outstanding chicken. Thank you, Rubios, for making it so easy."}
{"text":"Horrible food. They messed up on my order and brought me raw bacon to try to fix it. The food was cold and you could tell it had been sitting there a while. I do not recommend the place."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their fish tacos and they're pretty consistent.  If ever you get a chance you should check out their tortilla soup."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this Rubio's every Tuesday for $1.50 Fish Tacos.  Jason and his staff are the BEST!  He is always very friendly to us and everyone else that comes in.  Very well run place.  One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Our family of four loves this place! Lorena, the manager there always greets us with a smile. The food is super reasonable and fresh. It is consistently great! We love this place!"}
{"text":"THE CALIFORNIA BOWLS ARE LIT.  Literally the best Rubios ever. 11/10 would eat again"}
{"text":"Delicious and Healthy Fast Food! No place else can you get a large selection fish options, fresh salsa, fresh tortillas and all at a fast food restaurant? I would give them 5 stars, but the one thing that keeps me from going there more is that it does cost more than I can always afford.  To be fair though, the food is much higher quality than any other fast food. I have now joined the email club and I get constant coupons which makes their food much more affordable!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rubios for a long time! I almost always get the two taco plate with blackened mahi mahi, well today's the first time I've come in a while and come to find out mahi-mahi Is no longer on the menu. Well the cashier reassured me that ono taste almost the same. So I ordered it... it did not taste remotely close at all! Looks like I'll have to find something else to order! #bringbackthemahimahi"}
{"text":"They have a wonderful ambiance! I really like their cleanliness and openness.  I'm grateful they are on my way from work and they are very quick and thorough.  Thanks to your wonderful staff!"}

{"text":"This morning, I woke up to some pretty bad text messages from my girlfriend. We had an argument the night before and to be totally honest... this establishment made my morning. After dropping off my 3 children at school, I arrived to find the sweetest Mexican man, Nick Shift Leader. He was all smiles, and he made my morning much better. His positive attitude along with the atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel like I was at the jolliest Quinceañera! Thank you so much, Rubio's!! I'll be catering you in a few months for my birthday!! :- )"}
{"text":"I luv this place.  Have been going to for awhile now.  The one in Goodyear is always doing great business, at least when I go.  

My favorite is the fish tacos plate. MMMmmmmmmmmmm"}

{"text":"Taco Tuesdays! I have cravings a lot... so on Tuesdays, I go to Rubio's. Their original Fish Taco combo really satisfies that craving. The salsa bar is pretty cool too. On Tuesdays the tacos are cheaper! Great place for lunch when youre on the go. And even a better place to go when you can't decide on dinner."}
{"text":"I love rubios. Great flavor and food. But it took me 20 minutes to get my food. Shouldn't take that long. 5-10 is acceptable."}
{"text":"Decent burrito spot. Not the best. Presentation is nice though. I am a burrito expert and I approve this message."}
{"text":"Food is great. Don't come on lunch unless you want to stand and eat!   will be back again!"}
{"text":"I visited this rubios sunday night and there was a bit of a wait. I guess there was a new manager there Kiesha or something. So rude and grosse. Literally made me lose my apetite when i saw her scratching her ginormous stomach. Literally digging under her gut.... I have no idea how this person is a manager when she cant even manage keep her hands clean...i dont get it place wasnt even that busy my food was lousy . i guess this place is hit or miss cause i went in the sunday before that and my food was bomb."}
{"text":"Great food and great service for a fast food Mexican restaurant.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and it was a great experience from the minute we walked in. The service was so good! Nick and Tristan are awesome! They go above and beyond and help you in any way they can. The food was great; we will definitely be back. Thank you nick and Tristan!"}
{"text":"The cashier was very nice and accommodating (due to me being a vgan) .. The burrito its self was disappointing.

I ordered a California Bowl , but no chicken and in.a tortilla.

The was WAY to much rice , the beans and salsa was ok , the problem was they used guacamole instead of avacado (like in the bowl ) , there was BARELY any at all . 

Hubbys was so so.

For the price we paid , it wasn't worth it.

Sorry guys .."}
{"text":"Tuesdays here are the JAM! After 2:30, the classic fish tacos are $1.50 each! They're great, too. And coming from SoCal, I know my fish tacos. Sure, Wahoos Fish Tacos are classic. I've been going to the original shack in HB since I was 16. And those are tasty and healthy, no disrespect. But the RUBIOS tacos are TASTIER and UNHEALTHIER... and cheaper- What's not to love?

The salsa bar is good. For some reason, the salsa bar at any local El Pollo Loco is still my favorite, but I usually question the freshness of the EPL salsa bar, although I can never turn down the guacamole salsa, even when It's 85° and I am scraping the bottom of the cilantro-cluttered bowl.

Back to the fish tacos. I get them with an extra side of white sauce and extra cabbage. The fish is usually golden fried and of ample portion. Stay away from the lime, however, they are usually very potent and overpowering. Use a little salsa verde and a little chipotle salsa- Voilá!

And I usually only get 2. Very filling, although when I feel like a fiesta I can order as many as 4 (that's pronounced 'quatro').

The staff is friendly, the girl at the Lake Mead location rides a GSXR- Whoot Whoot! And they always throw in some free corn chips. Love it.

Try 'em, you'll like 'em."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Had the halibut burrito and it was just right.   Fish was light, flaky and moist; rice, beans, etc. had just the right seasoning.  Husband had shrimp tacos which are always a delight....always cooked perfectly.  

Rubio's is always clean and the staff all are helpful and so polite.  
Definitely my \"go to\" place for a delicious and quick meal."}
{"text":"Clean busy shop near plenty of shopping and on my way to Estella mountain ranch. The food is excellent, especially for the price and the service is above and beyond for a chain restraint. The street taco trio and shrimp enchilada were just what we needed for a 'no cook' night and for only $19.00 (I had an ice cold corona while waiting 10 minutes for the food). Recommend Rubios if you're hungry for good seafood focused mexican food at a very nice price."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents & brother to lunch at Rubio's and well basically I loved it!!!!!!!!!! Rubio's beats every other mexican or tex mew place in Texas. Everything was very fresh, the chips were perfect and the floor was so clean you could eat off it. Next time I'm back in Mesa, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Rubio's and this location at Bell Road and Tatum is my favorite one of all the restaurants in the area. I actually drive past two Rubio's that at closer to eat here. 
The food is fresh and consistent and this comes from someone who eats there at least once a week.
And the staff are wonderful, very friendly, thoughtful and welcoming. This makes a very nice atmosphere among the customers.
Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Always fresh. Super flavorful  and so much variety. The staff is always nice and prompt. Love it."}
{"text":"Been there maybe 25 times. 90% of the time their salmon burrito is excellent, fresh, healthy, you can just feel the omega 3s making you smarter as you eat it. Two times though they overcooked it and used non-fresh lettuce which tasted bad. And one time I got sick, possible food poisoning."}
{"text":"I don't care much for breaded fish, ie. Rubio's original fish tacos. However the new grilled sea bass taco with coleslaw, cilantro, lime, chipotle sauce rivals any of my fav fish taco places in California. It's super fresh, zesty, smells delicious, and hits all the right taste buds! It's everything a proper fish taco should be, highly recommended. Everything you read about their shrimp is also true. The grilled shrimp gourmet taco is to die for. I've been meaning to try it in a burrito, yes a grilled shrimp burrito! Besides the sea food, the grilled chicken quesadilla combo is one of my favorites with all the right ingredients, and the sides of guacamole, sour cream, pico, beans, and chips, yum!"}
{"text":"Solid options for fast casual mexican fare.  Where else in a landlocked area like Scottsdale will you find a quality fish taco.  I definitely prefer this place over Baja Fresh, Chipotle, or any of the other usual suspects."}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars for the excellent customer service!!! We LOVE the food always but the young woman behind the counter today was on top of her customer service skills! Not sure of her name but she had a beautiful tattoo going up her left arm. She showed us all of our items before she bagged them, gave us reccomendations off the menu and made she we had everything we needed before sending us off! A+++++"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  100 times better than Chipotle and better than some local Mexican places in the area!  Super affordable and delicious!   What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for the manager that was at the register. He greeted everyone asked how there day was and did it not like a robot but very genuine. Thank you the food was great and this was my first visit."}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews."}
{"text":"Try the fish tacos. Decent food for a fair price in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has tanked!!! What a dive! Walls, furniture & decor is destroyed & needs redo! Bathrooms are a disaster & doubt they are wiped down on a daily basis. Bathroom in need of supplies. Garbage cans overflowing. Staff yelling at other staff members! 
Food was fine but this place has fallen apart!!!  

Employees mean well. Rubios management needs to reassess this location."}
{"text":"I've never seen a place change its menu as much as they do. 
Generally great food.  The prices are ok. My partner just orders Shrimp tacos with nothing on them. Which they only seem to have a price for the gourmet Shrimp Tacos so that is irritating.
The chips the last couple of times have been a bit chewy and tasted like they were fried in old grease. Growing up in a restaurant i know old grease when I taste it.
Nonetheless, we like our Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This is by far the best Rubio's location in the valley. Salsa bar always is neat and clean, food is always fresh and staff are friendly. Menu selection is great."}
{"text":"I have to say I really like Rubio's. The food is always good and I love the fish Tacos.
I just spent a few days in Cancun for my Birthday. So I have wanting Mexican food ever since I got back.
However, the food in the states is not as good as down there.So it is hard to find a match. I am going to say the Rubio's is right on it. 
The food here is fresh and good! Really good. The salsas are fresh and delicious as if they are made every day.
 I always like them ,no matter which location I try.
The place is clean, the food very good. Even the restrooms are clean and well stocked. I highly recommend This Rubios!"}

It ain't fancy, but the food is always solid, and the people that work there are very friendly.  I appreciate someone that has a smile on their face at work!

Last night, my 'seester' and I decided to go there.  They don't have Rubio's in Prescott, so she almost always wants to go when she's here.

Right now they have several langostino lobster items.  Run, don't walk, to your nearest Rubios and try them.  Oh.  My.  Gawd....  My sis and I both got the surf and turf taco platter.  The lobster taco has incredible -- garlicy lobster chunks, shredded cabbage, onion, and cilantro.  It was truly wow-worthy.  The steak taco was pretty damn good too.  It was kind of cool -- they bake the cheese onto the corn tortilla -- so it gets sort of chewy.  It was AWESOME.  It also has bacon bits (life just isn't worth living without bacon), and this chipotle crema on it.  Woo-freakin-hoo!

During our meal the manager came over to our table to check on us.  She wanted to see what we thought of the lobster.  It was just nice that she wanted to know we were happy with our food.  How refreshing!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I want a fish taco to be.

The Boyfriend and I will often split a combo plate as a snack. One tasty taco each, and shared beans and chips. With two drinks, it's snacky perfection for under $15.

This location is clean and airy (lots of windows). Good service."}
{"text":"Fish taco especial and quesadilla with side order of beans for lunch. Well, the taco had more cabbage than anything else.  I never did find the guacamole as advertised for this dish. After several bites of crunchy batter, I did taste something  that might have been fish.  The quesadilla was average and basic, but the side order of beans was the real surprise!! A small, approx 2 oz. serving size, mostly liquid.  Could the restaurant spare a decent serving of beans.? Had a vague memory of the last Rubios and it wasn't like this one.  This one cemented my opinion about eating at Rubios ever again. Won't."}
{"text":"Alright look...
I know this is Arizona and we have tons of great authentic Mexican food on like every corner...but I can't freaking help it, I LOVE RUBIO'S TACOS OKAY?? 
I love them and I won't give them up for something more authentic or whatever! And I love that I can load up on salsa and lines!! 
The only bummer is their guacamole is virtually tasteless...if I was in it for the guacamole then yeah maybe I'd go somewhere else. But I'm in it for the gourmet chicken taco platter soo..."}
{"text":"The service here is always really fast, food is always great. 
This is one of my fiancé and my favorite informal/inexpensive restaurants to go to. I always get the classic chicken taco platter and it's always good. Like always. I'm here weekly, I've NEVER had a bad order (knock on wood). They also have an awesome salsa bar! 

I do have one suggestion if management is reading...I work around this area and often call my order in. No fail every time I'm put on hold they forget about me lol sometimes they just put the phone down and I just hear them talking in the background. I would definitely implement a better system for call in orders. 
Otherwise, this place rocks!!!"}
{"text":"I generally prefer Chipotle but this Rubio's is pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the wild ono burrito and my husband had the shrimp and bacon burrito. Both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Pinto beans are awesome. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can't comment on much of their food, but all their vegetarian options have always left me satisfied. The only thing I dislike is their high prices (burrito with just beans and cheese...almost 5 dollars). They don't make their veggie options any cheaper even though they don't contain their most expensive ingredient- meat."}
{"text":"I sometimes provide lunches for Medical Practices and I can always count on Rubio's. The food is fresh and looks wonderful. It is delivered on time and everyone is very friendly. Today I ordered lunch and Donnia helped with the catering order. She was upbeat, polite and very helpful. Thank you to the whole team there at the Goodyear office. You will continue to be one of my first choices."}
{"text":"I don't want to give a fast food restaurant five stars, but as far as fast food goes, this is heads and tails above the other crap. I can actually get a healthy meal here. Manager, Tino, is a problem solver."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in this area and have been going to this Rubio's location for several years. On each of our prior two visits for take out, our order was incorrect. Each time we called the restaurant and spoke with the manager on duty. The most recent time the manager offered to give us credit saying that they wanted to make it right and the next meal was on Rubio's and to just let them know the next time that we came in. 

This evening maybe not even two weeks since that visit, my husband went to get our usual takeout order and advised the manager that we were told our next meal was on Rubio's. The manager on duty, Oscar not only refused to honor this but became rude and argumentive saying that they didn't keep track of these things, that he needed to know the exact date, the name of the manager we spoke with and the exact meal so that he could go through all of the receipts for that evening. My husband explained that he didn't have the exact date and thought the managers name was Rick - Oscar said there were a lot of managers and he wouldn't honor the other manager's promise to make it right. My husband explained that we would pay this time but we would never be back and Oscar's response was 'whatever'. 

Very poor customer service this evening and even worse quality as of late. There are so many other places to eat near us, we have no problem never going to this Rubio's location again."}
{"text":"Love Rubio's! Love Love Love their fish and shrimp anything! My favorite is the Orange Chipotle Salad with Shrimp! Now, I am hungry!"}
{"text":"Fresh, reliable, nicely cooked food and an attentive and friendly staff (nice job Mark!) make this a great place for lunch or dinner.

Stick with the fish tacos or various sorts and it's hard to go wrong. I recommend the original and the mahi mahi blackened.  Four different salsas to choose from to go with you order of chips."}
{"text":"Lunch time. Satisfactory for fast food. Citrus rice and black beans were lukewarm. Probably sitting under a warmer, but they hadn't reached a point where you can tell they've sat a long time. 

I added cilantro and onion mix to dress up citrus rice and make tastier than the plain presentation. 

The black beans were satisfactory. What can I say? I'm not a big fan of black beans, but they came with the meal.

I ordered the enchilada special which included one shrimp and one chicken. Both came with some cheese inside, the chicken for sure and I think the shrimp too. I say yes because I tasted very little shrimp and a lot of something else which I'm assuming was cheese.

The enchilada corn tortilla was not soft, a tad firm not representing a good enchilada and not to my liking. It tasted as if they rolled the enchilada and cold tortilla, warmed it and served. The amount of chicken and shrimp were minimal, but lots of cheese to add to your your fat and cholesterol. Towards the end I unrolled the hard tortilla and picked out the meat leaving an abundance of cheese. Yes, lots of cheese and imo not good cheese. 

I'm giving two stars only because I skipped breakfast and having late lunch. I was hungry and many times food tastes better than it is. I don't know why I tortured myself eating unhealthy.

Did I finish my plate? No. 
Would I eat the enchiladas again? No"}
{"text":"The food is decent. The service is mediocre. The wait time when I went last was insane. They had 3 people in the kitchen, a manager who looked like she was wondering around as if she didn't even work there, and one cashier who kept jumping between the register and cleaning the dining area. The icing on the cake was the crushed chips I was served..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican fast food restaurant. This location is always clean and very efficient. I'm glad they put a Rubio's close to my house"}
{"text":"Such great food, good service, and the restaurant is always so clean!! I have been coming almost weekly for the last several months, this location really out does itself."}
{"text":"This place is great!  George the shift leader was incredible. His team was friendly and happy especially since it was a half hour after closing. The music was upbeat and hip. Ill definitely be coming to this location more often. Oh yeah, and of course my food was great!"}
{"text":"For the price $13.00 it's a great lunch spot. The grilled gourmet chicken taco plate is my favorite. The chicken is fresh and plentiful and has bacon and great seasoning. I love that they have fresh brewed flavored iced tea too."}
{"text":"I used to Love this place...but when I went recently, it really changed. They seem to be taking shortcuts on the food. My daughter asked for a bean and cheese burrito. Plain...they put some kind of sauce in it and seemed bothered when she went up to get it corrected. The girl pushed the burrito back at her and said, well...you might as well keep it because we are just going to throw it away. We sat there and waited for a little while. As we waited...2 more people's orders were wrong. Wish they would get it right again. I used to love their food"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice. The fish taco is like nothing I have had elsewhere, and I enjoyed it. I can't say that I like it as much as Chipotle, but it is decent food and it has Chipotle slightly beat when it comes to price (although it is still kind of expensive for what you get). One great thing about Rubio's though that I love is that they give you a free meal on your birthday (with signup). That shows that they care for their customers and it was what brought me into the restaurant. I will probably visit from time to time."}
{"text":"Along with Chipotle (which hadn't yet moved further out to the ring road, but was still located by the movie theaters and Cold Stone), this place was one of the few places I could get a solid meal from while working at the mall.  It's a welcome, indulgently cheesy break from Subway and Paradise Bakery.  Yes, there's often a wait during busy times, but the line is usually nowhere near as bad as what can form at Paradise, Chipotle, or Panda Express.

The enchiladas (which kept disappearing from and reappearing back on the menu) are very good for being fast food, especially when you get a side of chips that you can dip in the leftover red sauce.  Their quesadillas are a very generous size and have a nice crisp on them.  The shrimp and (limited time) langostino lobster items are very good too.  Add your choice of protein (shrimp!) to a quesadilla to bulk it up for another long shift of retail work!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by all of the 5 star reviews for this place.

I grew up in San Diego, the birthplace of Rubios.  The original restaurant was near my father's office and I remember my first opportunity to enjoy their fresh fish tacos - which I will never forget.  

I was also excited to learn that there was a Rubios near my office and of course made a trip to enjoy this childhood treat.

This location is the polar opposite of my original experience.  

The staff is not friendly or helpful

The restaurant is dirty and smells strange.

And the food is sub-par - I received pieces of hard, inedible avocado and was told that they were \"having problems with their avocados\".  They did not offer to refund my order or provide a replacement.

I will not return."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican fast-food chain, WITH cold beer, friendly employees and sustainable, great tasting fish?  YES!!  It's a delight every time I go.  The food is fresh and made to order, the service is always top notch and for me, the commitment to sustainable fishing practices goes a long way.  I recommend Rubio's every time someone from back east comes out to visit."}
{"text":"Rubios is delicious, fast, and fresh! You can eat healthy or go all out. I love that they list the calories on the board. My favorite thing is the shrimp tacos or pacific mahi mahi California bowl. For a lighter option the balsamic and roasted veggie salad is delicious. Ask for the dressing on the side."}
{"text":"They have really good fish tacos and they use to have a blackened mahi mahi that was amazing they changed that to another type of mahi mahi that is still pretty good but I miss the old style."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Rubio location to come to the workers really make me feel welcome! My food is always constant and fresh! Love the special chicken burrito ! 
 Always clean .. it can get hectic when there is a rush or soccer season but I just try to avoid those days"}
{"text":"Love my chicken balsamic vegetable salad @ Rubio's. Load it up with extra veggies (onions and cilantro, pickled jalapenos) and as much salsa as you want at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Steak burrito especial was delicious. Perhaps it was the location (lake mead) or the fact that it was free. But kudos to Rubios for using this promotional opportunity to dish out some good stuff. Fast food Tex Mex done right."}
{"text":"I love Rubios. They have the best flavors. My favorite is the gourmet shrimp with black beans instead of pinto. I like this place better than other more expensive Mexican restaurants. I like the salsa bar. I visited this location on Lake Mead. The service was very good and the food was amazing!  Thanks, Rubios, for making my taste buds happy."}
{"text":"Terrible service, doesn't function as a normal location regarding  prices. Avoid this location... In fact I drove several miles (since there was no west side location) to come here specifically! Almost makes me never go to rubios when I'm just becoming a fan! ...  So instead... Today...  I left and went to Canes! It wasn't what I was in the mood for,  but they're awesome, so they get my patronage (and money)."}
{"text":"Nice counter people but terrible kitchen workers. This is the fifth time that I've had to head back after seeing that my order was wrong when opening my burritos and it will be the last. They've put shrimp in vegetarian burritos, no chicken in chicken burritos (who does that!? $9 bean and rice burritos )  and added onions to friends orders that asked for none and mentioned they were allergic. 

I'll never trust this one again. I wish they would put something else there because now it's just a waste of food space in my neighborhood. So the moral of the story is don't go here because they suck at taking direction and making burritos."}
{"text":"Cool spot.  Was craving something after a day of shopping and I saw that this was close by.  I wish I was still a pescatarian because they have so many dishes with fish or seafood!  I ordered the Grilled Gourmet Portobello & Poblano (no bacon) Tacos with Rice & Beans to go.  I loved that the tacos had lots of pieces of avocado in them (Caribbean girl alert!)  The food had a nice flavor, but I asked the girl to substitute flour tortillas instead of corn and she forgot.  Rice was also a bit mushy.  I'll try the chips next time.  Portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"Nice to see some things stay the same.  
Coastal Trio has been my go to for years and it's good to sea (sorry) that it's just the same as I remember.  For the price you really can't beat this.  Three good tacos, each one unique.  I get the blackened version, and even after dozens of times I haven't decided which of three is my favorite.  I want to say it's the shrimp, because I always save it for last but they're all good.

Oh, and the little salsa bar, though small has enough choice to still hit the spot every time."}
{"text":"Lorena and the rest of her team are completely useless. While I waited 20 min for my burrito, I saw 3 major issues. First, there were two kids yelling and screaming at each other without a parent. They eventually hit a random women in the back if the head which made her spill the hot sauce on her lap. When the woman complained, a side employee came out and walked over to the kids. No apology, no correction of the kids, just a blank stare. 

Second was the assistant running the food. She had no idea what each order had and made several trips for each person. When she wasn't running food she was hanging out with her friend at a table. This leads to the 3rd, my burrito, which sat there for over 15 min on the countertop getting cold. All I wanted was a fast burrito in Arcadia and this is what I had to deal with. I really hope the construction at 44th or 32 puts them wakes the owner up so he can hire people who actually care."}
{"text":"This is our first time at a Rubio's and found out it is quite great!  Very refreshing I had the sea bass tacos and a cerveza, Ballast Point (awesome!), the crew was great and attentive.  The food tasted very fresh and seasoned perfect!  We found an awesome place for lunch!  Thanks Aubrey for making our first time a great time!"}
{"text":"What happened to this once really good chain is a damn shame! For many years the manager Mark always made sure his store served quality!  All the other stores in Vegas were terrible but I could always count on perfect tacos from Marks crew!  As the first time I ever ate at an original Rubio's in Carlsbad Ca Marks store preserved its good quality! Last we heard he got promoted then we went in 2 weeks later... New faces... no Mark! Mystery? The new crew just said he quit! A career minded employee any company would be coveting to have! I proceed to order my normal but was given a list of what they are out of! Avocado, guacamole, their famous  mango Pico and a few more!  My tacos were a cold pathetic pile of red sauce and a tiny drop of what Was supposed to be chicken. I asked the new gal for a side a chicken to fill the taco! It's a Wednesday dinner time.  No one inside except the new workers ...one with long hair shaking his locks out near the salsa bar! And the whole place was dirty ! Omg ! So sad to see a once good Rubio's turn south as the others in town have! Where is Mark?! Someone who is smart would have never let him go! Maybe Rubio's sold its soul to a conglomerate junk Chinese Corp! Boo on Rubio's now! Never again!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place. I get the gourmet shrimp tacos or the panko crusted tacos and they're really good. However the wait is usually long and it's a hit or miss if they actually put salt and pepper in the beans. This last trip my mom got one of those salad bowls and the avocado was brown, the lettuce limp, nothing looked fresh. It grossed my mom out so much that she barely enjoyed the regular fish taco she got a la carte. She also mentioned how dry and bland it was. Which is weird because fish tacos are normally really really good. The guy at the counter was nice enough to refund us for the bowl and gave us a voucher for a free meal. Which my mom will use to get the gourmet shrimp tacos and after that she won't be back. This place just keeps going downhill."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place on May 21st
Hubby enjoyed his Mahi mahi bowl as for me not at all. I asked for a chicken burrito got a rice burrito literally rice burrito I couldn't believe it. Found two small chunks of chicken towards the end never again. Sticking to Chipotle and Zaba's."}
{"text":"Rubio's is definitely a favorite lunch spot of mine. This location is very large with a nice patio as well. The staff is great and the place is very clean! 

And of course the food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Great food service and fish tacos on tues rock! Clean and the salsas at the salsa bar were delicious"}
{"text":"I try not to expect much....but compared to other locations it even lacks. It's simple melt the cheese on my nachos, and maybe actually put e ought cheese. Staff seems friendly but nothing stands out."}
{"text":"Never had Rubios before. A young guy took my order. He was helpful and really nice. Food was great. Very clean and fast."}
{"text":"The mahi mahi is fantastic, never really was a fish person but my brother got me into it. Always come here at this particular location always fresh and delicious 
The chipotle white sauce is a must also"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty! They no longer have a wet burrito. They discontinued the sauce as not enough people ordered it. Bummer! Otherwise, food is good and reasonable and most importantly, has many choices. The chopped salad is good with grilled chicken."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot. So glad it is close to me. I was at another location for the first time the night before and liked it so much I decided to come to this location of lunch the next day.
I must have just missed the lunch rush because the place was pretty much empty. Which made me wonder for a second if there was something wrong with this location. Where were all the people? I thought it would be packed with people. Not that I am complaining because I was able to get right up to the counter and order and get back to work pretty quickly. There is nothing wrong with this location because the food was fantastic. So was the service.
This time I got the Langostino Lobster Burrito. I have never had lobster in burrito before and wondered how it would taste. But I was told it was very good and sure enough it was fantastic. I think I like the Original Fish Tacos a little more but this was good. I could eat 4 of there tacos even though 2 do a good job of filling you up. It is one of those things that is so good you don't want to stop eating even though you are full.
I will definitely be back again and again and again and again. So good and cheap too."}
{"text":"I think this is one of my new favorite spots. I don't remember ever eating at a Rubio's before. I'm sorry I haven't.
I wanted to meet my girlfriend on her side of town for dinner and after bouncing around a few different choices we settled on this one. Great choice. I got the original fish taco 2 taco plate. I got it with rice and black beans. She got a bean and cheese burrito. We split an order of chips and guacamole.
Everything was so good. The chips were nice and crisp. They guacamole was fresh and very tasty. We thought it was a little small but then realized it was only a dollar so for that it was great.
The fish tacos were awesome. Perfectly battered. The sauce they put on them is so good. That is what puts it over the top. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice. Even when I got chips instead of the rice I substituted they had no problem switching it out. The prices are very reasonable too.
My girlfriend said she likes just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try more things. In fact I didn't. The next day I went to another location by me for lunch.
It may be a fast food chain but it is so good and cheap that I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"A fast food chain with pretty legit Baja style mexican food. They promote sustainable fish and recycling, which is pretty rad - Except the whole disposable cups and all. The salsa bar is probably what keeps this place going. Take advantage of it. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very polite and welcoming staff. Food was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, resonable prices, large portions, salsa bar, friendly service, clean environment."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. the baby kale and potato soup was outstanding. Followed that up with Paella that melted in you mouth. Finished it all up with the best Baklava I've had in a long time. Everything is made fresh to order. We'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Did someone say taco Tuesdays at Rubio's? I was looking for a place where I could enjoy dinner with my children and this location was perfect. The service was amazing and my kids enjoyed both the fish and shrimp tacos. We also enjoyed having the food brought to our table instead of us standing waiting for it. This is a place i will be going back to. Thank you Rubio's."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly.  Place is very clean inside and nice selection of salsas, limes, chopped onions w/ cilantro, marinated jalapeno peppers.  Ordered the 3 street tacos platter, two steak and one chicken taco, chips and beans.  Chips were very tasty, steak was nice and moist, more so than the chicken.  Nice bite size tacos.  Also got a Rice and bean burrito was was a nice size and cheap.  Left spending less than $12 for tasty lunch for two. Will be back.  For the price, place was fast, tasty, and accommodated custom orders."}
{"text":"they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!"}
{"text":"I love everything they make. My 'must haves' would definitely be the chick/tortilla soup. The portabella taco is always good. The shrimp/mandarin salad is fabulous. Fresh brewed ice tea and the most unexpected music playing. I like it, I don't think most folks even know what they are hearing, and that makes me giggle. Hooray, Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Good food for when you are in a rush and want to get a quick bite. They have a table filled with different ingredients that you can add to your meal. They had different salsas onions, picked vegetables, and many more. 
The lines can get crazy and people are standing everywhere to order their food and get their food."}
{"text":"So delicious and so fresh! Also the customer service here is EXCEPTIONAL I love when I can see an owner or manager working right along aide their employees taking orders, expoing food and taking food to the clients.. all while stopping by each table to make sure everyone is satisfied.. I had better service here then in most sit down full service restaurants. Thank you for a great meal and dining experience :)"}
{"text":"For a fast food place, this Rubios is tops. Great hands on managers. Had the langostino enchiladas and was pleasantly surprised how much langostino meat was in it. I have never been disappointed at whatever I eat here"}
{"text":"I have been on a quest for quite sometime to find the best fish tacos in town. I've tried them at bonefish grill, yardhouse, wahoo fish tacos ect... Still I always come back to rubios for the best fish tacos out there. The pieces of fish are large and crispy. Better than any restaurant I have tried fast food or not. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the cleanest one!! My husband and I have been to the north Scottsdale one and the one on 101 and both have dirty floors. Look at the corners. They're clean at the Bell and Tatum location."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! The panko crusted shrimp, mahi mahi, and street style chicken tacos are to die for! Perfectly seasoned by the add-ins, and tons of options for sauces at the salsa bar if you need an extra kick. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the where this RFMG is located. I also hate the parking lot that one has to use to visit this establishment. Good food, friendly service and shares a nice courtyard with several other eateries.  Out of all the Rubio's I seem to have visited this year, this one by far is the best to people watch."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The guy working at this location kept giving a family free food because he kept messing up their orders. Later I realize the food he was giving them was my food. All I got was a return and a waste of 20 minutes"}
{"text":"This is a really good Rubio's location.  The staff is very friendly and the food tastes much better than the other locations I have been too.

Try 
  - Portobello / Poblano tacos"}
{"text":"Getting my order took a long time. I think there was only one cook. A lot of people were waiting for their orders. The girls, working the register, looked unhappy. I come here about twice a month. Good food. I'll come again."}
{"text":"This Rubio's location is unlike any other. The service is friendly, fast and consistently GREAT every time.  Also, the food tastes better than every other location I've been to."}
{"text":"They have a great menu. Good variety. I often wonder why I don't eat there more often. I love all the fish and seafood options. Most places seem to have the same old tasteless stuff. At Rubio's, I find myself having a hard time deciding. 

We stopped in around lunch time. There were a few people in front of us, but the line moved quickly. We decided on a steak burrito and a shrimp burrito. Both were hot and fresh. Very flavorful. There is a salsa  bar. Prices seem high until you take that first yummy bite. Then you realize it worth paying a little more for good food.

Good service. Clean inside."}
{"text":"Let me breakdown my first time visit.  I call for a take out order of their Trio.  The person on the phone was very friendly and accommodating.  Next I went to pick up the order and the person at the counter was the same person that I talked to on phone, I think.  She was very friendly and was very nice to talk to.  She wanted to make sure that my order was up to par.  Next, I started eating the food.  OMG, the food was so good that I wanted more.  It even beat my favorite place AJO Al's on 90th Street and Mountain view.  I will be going back and this restaurant needs to be rated number one in my survey for best Mexican restaurant.  I normally don't write reviews but this one deserves it.  Thank you Rubio's for one of the greatest experiences that I have had."}
{"text":"Yes the food was good but my god over 15 min for 2 fish tacos without them telling you something might be wrong?"}
{"text":"Ate here before going to see the Jabbawockeez show.  It was okay.  Chipotle is better.  No big deal."}
{"text":"No matter what people have been saying about this place, I still love the tacos here. I think it's fresh and flavor. Not the best tacos but its definitely ok for a rush meal/ lunch ."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh seafood meals.  A lot of choices to choose from too.  Serve alcohol as well.  Good combinations of food."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly service. James made our 1st time here, very welcoming! Great fresh food! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Just recently recovered from food poisoning. Ate the steak taco platter. Would not recommend anyone to eat this garbage."}
{"text":"This location is great! They are always clean and have great customer service! All employees have a smile on your face and make conversation with you! The best of all is their food! They make it quick and have with flavor!"}
{"text":"I first heard of Rubio's when I lived in Los Angeles specially at UCLAs food court. I remember the college kids would rave about their food especially the vegetarians. It smelled delicious.

Anywho, in Vegas I'm always craving Mexican food like I always crave in California. So instead of opting for the buffet we decided to get food court meals.

My middle sister informed me that Rubio's was bomb dot com and that convinced me because we both love Mexican food. So their specialty was the fish taco. Which was delicious and crispy.

It was nothing spectacular but it was a good taco. I even got one street taco which had smeared on guacamole...if you know me....I despise avocados in every form and it gave my street taco a weird taste but I ate it and still alive. I would recommend they have in big print street tacos come with guacamole smeared on it for base...yuk.

My fault for assuming \"ordinary\" street tacos. I did like the fact they had onions and cilantro...because if you know me...cilantro all day everyday.

I'm not sure if I would have Rubio's again...but I can mark it off my try list. There's better fresh Mexican food.

I do have to say the customer service was good! Answered my tedious questions with a smile."}
{"text":"I effin love Rubios! They have a great product, relaxing atmosphere and the service is fast and friendly. Its a great spot for a light lunch. Several healthy options to choose from. Try any of the salads, the health mex tacos or the grilled mahi mahi tacos. So good. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Super friendly location and the food is awesome.  RFMG is RFMG does....delicous."}
{"text":"Original Fish Taco's are delicious as are the breaded shrimp tacos. Love the chips and pinto beans as well. Don't know why we have not ate here more in the past but it is going to be on our list of regular places to eat from now on."}
{"text":"I come to Rubios at least 3 times a week. The food is amazing. In addition to the food, what keeps me coming back is the excellent customer service! Mark and his team always exceed my expectations! They are so personable, and friendly!"}
{"text":"Good Fast Food Mexican food with good salsa choices (considering it is fast food).

Especially good for an early lunch when Diablos isnt open yet."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food! The restaurant itself could use some updating but everything is great. The mango avocado salad (with shrimp) is SO good! One of my favorites. I also have to say they have some of the best churros around."}
{"text":"I love the salsa, I loved the fish tacos,  salads. .. EVERYTHING! it's always super fresh. The service is excellent and they are now adding 3000 jobs to the Phoenix area! Great company with great values. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better \"Americanized\" Mexican restaurants.  Famous for their fish tacos, which are very tasty (on Tuesdays, they are only $1.25!).  I've also tried their Burrito Especial - not bad, but can be dry at times.  They also have a salsa bar you can choose from.  Restaurant is clean, roomy, and service is quick."}
{"text":"Have not been to a bad RFMG yet.  This store once you get past the dump parking lot is great.  The staff was friendly and my ginger soy fish tacos were outstanding. Take my advise and order 12 of them.  This is a nice mellow pace to enjoy a lunch,"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal made from fresh ingredients. The fish tacos are outstanding and the bowl Mexican salad with grilled shrimp was incredible!

The menu was great and the salsa bar allowed you to customize each dish. Did I say the guacamole was home made, yummy..."}
{"text":"I was definitely was imagining making sheimp tacos last night..and voila! We decided to have Rubios for lunch today and what do you know... Shrimp tacos.

I usually just order the original fish tacos which are $1.50 on Tuesdays after 2:30!! And my favorite is the Atlantic Salmon burrito (blackened)

But today I got one salsa shrimp taco and the original fish taco on a plate with chips and beans... 

Fish taco was good as usual.. I add the green onion cilantro with tomatillo salsa with it for a burst of flavor... Oh yea..the limes that they gave uswere dry... Literally squeeezed it so hard for one drop pf lime juice.

Salsa verde shrimp tacos were pretty good but there were only 4 tiny pieces of shrimp...def not what it looked like in the picture lol... And they put too much onion (but nothing the extra tomatillo salsa can fix :)) and the avocado added creamyness to it.

Overall 3.5 for this experience!"}
{"text":"I love this Rubios!!! The shrimp tacos, bean burrito enchilada style, fish tacos, and veggi burrito are AMAZING! I have never had bad food at this location and anytime I am in AZ, this is the one place I have to go. All of the different sauces on the items are great, all the food is really fresh, and the staff is always friendly. I love the four different kinds of salsa's they have at the salsa bar. For \"fast\" mexican food that is always good, this is my favorite and I would send anyone to this location."}
{"text":"First, I am addicted to their original fish tacos. Everything is made on sight. Every order is made fresh and served piping hot. Every time I have been to this location, they have showed me my order for approval before bagging it to go. It is always spotless. But one of the things that strikes me the most at this location is the friendliness of the staff. Not only do they seem happy to see me, they all seem to genuinely like their job. Love the salsa and fresh chips. Great prices. Good portions. I cannot think of a single negative thing to say. Happy regular customer. :)"}
{"text":"I have heard about this Restaurant from friends in St. Louis. They told me that they have the best Fish Tacos. I was in the area and I was ready for lunch. I stop there and had two fish tacos', which was one of the lunch specials. Boy they are great and I called my friends to tell them that. I also had to tell them I was eating them on the patio. They were in a middle of snow storm so I felt great about that too. At first I didn't' think the two tacos were going to fill me but it sure did. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"While I may be risking my reputation by writing a positive review for a fast food chain, Rubio's has been consistently a safe option whe I don't have a choice but food court.

This particular location is inside Las Vegas South Premium Outlets, but the same thing can be said to any.

Unlike Chipotle, they do have seafood tacos, and in fact they are pretty decent.

If you haven't tried yet, trust me and order their fish taco especial. And let me know what you think here."}
{"text":"I had there balsamic chicken salad. It was terrible i could have made that salad myself at home.  All it had was some green leaves a few pieces of chicken and barely any grilled vegetables. Worst salad i have ever had."}
{"text":"I love fish tacos and although I do enjoy coming here, I don't think their fish is that fresh.  Well, let me rephrase, I don't think the oil they fry their fish in is that fresh.  It went past the due date of how often oil should be changed out when frying food.  Don't skimp out on this step Rubio's!

Other than that, the service was good, the salsa was good and the experience as a whole wasn't too bad.  They just really need to work on changing out their oil more frequently."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a quick lunch.  I had a Baja Burrito and it was good.  I am not a guacamole or avocado fan, so I am not sure how either of that taste.  The chips were good.  I like this place and tend to go once a week."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely gone down hill....there are 5 parties of folks waiting for their food...we've been waiting 30 minutes!! What a joke...they need an adult to work/manage this place...unbelievable."}
{"text":"Terrible service they always screw up the order and
Make you wait and never make it priority to get your ordered fixed before getting everyone else's order who walks in after.  The receipt will show exactly what you ordered and they'll bring something completely different out. They are so rude and make you feel rushed. Even though I love the food I will no longer spend my money here."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was quick, but I just want to leave the 5 star review for the guy working. I don't know his name but he was really friendly and just seemed like a really nice guy getting the job done. He was great! Good job."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, but this has been the second time I have left less than satisfied...

First time: I repeated myself numerous times letting them know I was HIGHLY allergic to any dairy and couldnt have the cheese or cream on the dish... she acknowledged and when I picked up my order, I double checked with the people making the food and they also confirmed there was no dairy.  So much to my suprise, I get back to my office and the bowl up to find cream sauce under the avocados.  :-(  I called in, and they did offer to replace my bowl, but my work is quite far and I was already back at work unable to leave again for a \"second lunch\" since I was the only one in the office.  Which meant no lunch for me that day...

So I thought I would give them another try... this time I got food for myself and someone else at the office.  Everyone was very nice, just as before, but I had to wait a while for my partners food since they had run out of chicken... okay, no big deal.  Well I get back to the office and my food was cold- they clearly had just let mine sit there the entire time as opposed to making his and mine at the same time.  Sad day Rubios, but I will not be back.

On the bright side- my coworker loved his meal!"}
{"text":"Great fish taco. I tried the special one. The fish taco was excellent, the shredded cabbage add crunchiness to the food and the corn tortilla taste fresh. Definately will go back, in fact my hubby and I already plan to go back there tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love! The bowl I had was awesome and the service is quick. Rubio's is definitely a great spot if you want a quick burrito or bowl."}
{"text":"Fish taco plate is composed two tacos, a little cup of refried beans and some tortilla chips.If you also get a drink, you will have to pay almost $9.

I do have to say, the fish taco was very tasty."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. They got my food order and my drink wrong but they were happy to fix it and give me an extra refill."}
{"text":"So Happy I moved close to a Rubio's. Always taste great and fresh! Only down side is with the prices the plates should come with a drink!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here and ordered 4 Fish tacos especial, 2 bucks each on tuesdays, delicious and fresh. Service fast, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars for original fish tacos.  They are heaven in your mouth.
Everything else I've tried is pretty blah.
Beans are tasteless, other tacos bland, rice is like red tinted steamed rice.
The fish tacos though....every bite is better than almost anything.
Service is usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because it's near my house and I love fish tacos. The pinto beans here are also amazing.

But what inspired me to write this review is the experience I had. It was around 12:30pm on a Tuesday and the line was 10 deep to order and most of the tables were taken in addition to a catering order. I have never seen it this busy and I overheard others mentioning the same thing.

The shift lead, Hallie I think according to her name tag, was at the register and was doing an absolutely phenomenal job. She was courteous to all (even those annoying people who ask a lot of questions and hold up the line) and was sure to make sure every customer understood the food was going to take a little longer than usual. She even offered me a free side of chips for the wait and another woman was offered a free drink. It wasn't necessary but that initiative was definitely appreciated."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The salsa bar is always fresh and the fish tacos are perfect! This is a weekly dinner stop for us. We LOVE you Rubios!!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan... Taco Tuesday ($1.50 original tacos) is the time to go... after one pm i believe.. Salsa bar... have always got the same simple basic fish taco.. I think they have beer, love there fish sauce."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch this past weekend and paid over $60 for 4 people. I asked for a pale ale and there were two. I asked if she knew which was better and she said she didn't drink. Ok, which one sells better? Which one do you hear the most about? She was a manager, so I feel like she should know something about all the product in her store. Her shirt was also filthy which I thought was a bit unprofessional. 

Food was OK. $9 for a chicken quesadilla and chips is a bit rediculous,  but it was ok. Everyone else at the table ordered a meal with beans. All the beans were cold. Long wait time for the food too.

Overall, I'd rather go elsewhere. For this price you could go to a sit down Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love Verde shrimp tacos!  And...the chips are thin and crispy - also great salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Delicious salsa bar and fish tacos are awesome! The tortillas taste completely homemade. They have flavored & regular tea that was really good! The price is very reasonable for a fresh Mexican fix! Wonderful! I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Terrible food made by people that don't care. This location is horrible. By far the worst in the valley. They have screwed up by order every time I go there. I will never go here again. Steer clear of this location. There is a Taco Bell down the street. At least they can get your order right."}
{"text":"They are known for the fish tacos & they don't disappoint. The fish is always so fresh & the baja style reminds me of my old hometown which I sincerely miss. 
It's a casual & very affordable place that is always quick & delicious. The salsa bar is also appreciated & I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos I have ever had. I came here based on a recommendation and I expected fast food quality food but was happily surprised with how good their fish tacos were.

I got the Fish Taco Especial plate which is the Original Fish Taco topped with handmade guacamole, jack and cheddar cheese and a cilantro/onion mix.

If you're looking to mix up the normal burger or sandwich I would recommend Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill for their fish tacos!"}
{"text":"We order Rubios about twice a week here at the office.  I often get it catered in for guests we have or company meetings.  The online catering option is extremely convenient as well!  The people working at this store (John the cashier, John the manager, and Liza...not sure how to spell her name) are always so friendly and helpful.  The food is always great too!"}
{"text":"These were the best fish tacos i have ever had. I loved the shrimp tacos. I got the trio and it was awesome. So sad there is not a Rubios in the Northwest"}
{"text":"Fish taco Tuesday is one of my favorite things!! Rubio's fish tacos are so good. The staff has been friendly every time I've been in there, but one employee, Alan, went above and beyond with his customer service. I'm in the customer service industry myself, and I like to recognize when a place has great customer service, so thank you Alan and crew!"}
{"text":"This isn't Rubio best location. Most of the time the place is pretty dirty and in need of a cleaning. On this day, nobody was even cooking in the back for 5 minutes  after we ordered. The end result was not great either. Some of the pieces of chicken in my nachos were cold and the beans were tasteless. Only the avocado saved the day. Fish Tacos seemed more nornal. Usually Rubios is pretty good in any location, but this mall outpost needs some help."}
{"text":"This was the most unorganized, hectic, and ridiculous experience I've ever had at a Rubio's, or at any eatery for that matter. I was picking up a catering order, which should have been ready at 11:30...With all of the confusion between the staff & the kitchen, in regards to multiple orders; it was obvious by noon that my order had not even been made yet. One of the employees was literally running back and forth, frantically delivering food to people's tables inside the restaurant. Meanwhile, a line of people piled out the door about 20 deep. The ice machine was out of ice for a good 15 minutes while I was waiting there for my order. This place was a mess. No system, no organization, and no communication between the staff in the front and the kitchen. I finally got my order, 50 minutes after it should have been ready. It's safe to say that I will never go back to this Rubio's & my office will most definitely not be making a huge catering order from them again, because they couldn't even get it right. With missing items, wrong items, and poorly put together burritos, let's just say it was a bad day for this poorly run Rubio's."}
{"text":"They have some of the best fish tacos in town.

If you go on Tuesday, the tacos are $1.74-$2.50 depending on which fish you get.

I usually get the regular with the white sauce on the side, and pico on the side, so it doesn't get soggy.

Their beans are also amazing. I usually get a large side and it comes with chips.

The salsa bar is awesome too. The chipotle is my favourite, its smokey and delicious.

If you do go for taco Tuesday, the special doesn't start until after 2:30pm and I suggesting getting their early because sometimes there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"I love Rubios!! With that said, there are good ones and bad ones. I have been to this one 3 times now and the food is always good, but the service is even better!  Definitely a good one!"}
{"text":"Restating what everyone knows.  Rubio's is the fish taco staple no matter which one you go too this one is no exception and one of the best I've been to.  Wish I had the franchise rights to a Texas expansion...we would \"blow up!\""}
{"text":"Fish taco Tuesday! For the price, the portion and quality is amazing. I haven't been disappointed with this establishment. The service is fast and friendly, place is clean and their condiments are always stocked. Parking is hassle free and they do accept Apple Pay!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We go there a lot and I cannot say anything bad about this place.  The service is always fantastic and the food great.  LOVE RUBIO'S!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely pick this place over any other option that's in the food court. I love the gourmet tacos!! Top off your tacos with the red salsa you can get at the salsa bar and also add on the chopped onions and cilantro!! YUMM!! Service is always great and the food always tastes fresh and good!"}
{"text":"This place will fix your fish taco craving in no time. Come in on Tuesdays for half off their classic fish taco after 2:30 PM... but you may have to remind the cashier, because their registers don't automatically give the discount. Wish I'd noticed this before I paid $8.

The shrimp verde taco is also good, but I'd personally request it on corn tortillas. They're currently promoting a langostino burrito that sounds tasty, but the fish tacos are reliably large and tasty. Service is surprisingly friendly and this location is a bit more formal than their usual grab-and-go set up."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and burritos!  Maybe not the best spot if you're in a hurry...takes a few minutes to prepare things fresh.  I come here every few weeks or so.  Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"At Rubio's all the food seems well prepared and fresh.  The place is always very clean.  The service personnel are always very friendly.  I like the fish tacos and the seafood bowls.   They have a great selection of salsa and hot sauces to add to the food.   I think I'll try one of the burritos next time I'm there.  They are a bit expensive.  But their food looks healthier than hamburgers."}
{"text":"Best gourmet tacos ever!!! The two taco plate is the bomb.com. You get the two tacos, delicious beans, and chips as well! You have the choice of steak, and chicken. (they are both delicious) 

This location has always been my favorite! The employees are friendly and they keep the place clean. The salsa bar is always full and they have my all time favorite drink... VANILLA COKE!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"We love Rubio's!  I remember the Original Rubio's, the little taco stand at the beach and every time we eat at Rubio's, I am reminded of that.  This particular location is always clean, always busy, but you never wait too long.  The staff is friendly.  I love how the salads (that are HUGE) are served in real bowls and you eat with real silverware, takes it up a lot of notches.   Now the food is the bomb (meaning that as a good thing)!  Recently, we ate there to celebrate my birthday month, so I got my free meal via email, great value.  We will keep coming back.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our food had a hair in it.  This is the 2nd time this has happened at this restaurant.  I tried contacting you at the web address below but kept getting a runtime error."}
{"text":"Fresh fast food, but a tad on the expensive side for what it is. I much prefer this place to Baja Fresh or Chipotle- Home of the ten dollar burrito! They have a great little salsa bar where you load your own plastic containers of a variety of salsas. If you've never had a fish taco and you think it sounds yucky, try one here and you'll change your mind!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Rubios before and the food is always consistent. But besides the food this location also has a great staff. All of the girls there, especially Vivian, are all friendly and knowledgeable about the food. I go there at least once a week and have never been disappointed. 

BTW, the Maui Maui burrito is my regular order. Great taste. Very fresh and quite filling."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, so far I am fairly impressed by the location. Clean, lots of seating inside and out, fast service. Got a burrito both times and there is a ton of food and its very good. 
A little on the pricey side, at least the portions are big enough that we usually have left overs to take home."}
{"text":"Cute and fast atmosphere. Prices are reasonable and the fish tacos were very nice and crispy. Add some Spanish rice and chips... Can't go wrong. I'll be back to try the burritos!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I attempted to have Lizeth, one of the counter employees, take my small catering order. She immediately threw her hands up and said I don't know how to enter that. She called her manager \"Nate\" to take the order. He was openly annoyed as \"I'm busy doing something\" was his response as he glared at me in annoyance. I was baffled that he was rushing to take my order and when I asked if they had bottled waters he angrily checked the fridge behind him and retorted \"were all out.\" I wasn't offered anything else and frankly was stunned at his continued annoyance toward me.
I was told the order would take 5 minutes to be set up.... I returned after 15 minutes and my food was ready to go but not bagged. There were no other customers in the restaurant. I could not believe the lack of professionalism by a manager. There are simply too many places to choose from and mistreating customers is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I just love their fish tacos. 

I was in the neighborhood and needed a fast fix,,,I was happy when I saw Rubios sign. 

Gentleman that was helping me was super nice and polite. He put my order in and it was delivered to my table in a timely manner. 

Place is nicely kept. Very clean, organized, and salsa counter was also very well taken care of. 

Fish taco was the bomb. 

Great fast food to have around when your fish taco cravings kick in."}
{"text":"Always a clean and friendly environment. This is one of my favorite locations. Always get my order correct and it's always fresh"}
{"text":"I want to praise the staff at Rubio's on 24th & Baseline for an outstanding job!  Today was my promotion ceremony & I ordered online for 4 orders of their Taco Bar for pick-up as soon as they opened at 10:00am.  I was worried that my order would not be ready in time for pick-up as soon as their restaurant opened at 10:00am so that my coworkers who were picking it up can make it back to my work in time to set it up & have ready by the time my ceremony started at 11:00am.  

I was very impressed how my 4 orders of their Taco Bar was not only done, but completely and neatly packed in 4 reusable bags to include serving tongs, serving spoons plastic forks and spoons, pape plates, napkins and the fresh food of steak, chicken, flour/corn tortillas, fresh guacamole, fresh salsa and all the different types of salsa to pick from.  It was beautifully assembled and tasted amazing!!

I highly recommend them for all occasions and their staff is very personable and courteous!  My ceremony was a success and the food was the icing on the cake!  Thank you SO much to the staff for not disappointing!  You guys/gals ROCK!!  Well done!"}
{"text":"I had to go have my Rubio's to restore my faith in the Burrito.. After my horrible experience at Roberto's taco shop on Friday, which I am just now recovering from (disgusting)  My husband and I went to Rubio's.  Had their Orange Salad grilled Talapia bowl and their California Bowl.. Amazing as always, OH and their salsa bar is CLEAN Always!!!!!!  Oh and the manager brought us our order to the table.. Thank God we have Rubio's... Save your stomachs from uncertain sickness and skip Roberto's and RUN to Rubio's.. Love this place.."}
{"text":"Was just here they ran out of sides but didn't bother to let us know at the time we ordered, nobody was there yet the ladies were very slow and had attitude.  First time having Rubios and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Just had the chopped salad and it was delicious as usual.   I like the zesty dressing."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff at this location. I was telling the cashier I didn't want onion on my nachos and one of the cooks came out to tell AND show me that their pico had onion in it but that he would put it on the side in a to go container. When my order was ready, it was walked out to me! You know, it's the little things like this that can make someone's day!"}
{"text":"The nachos were decent, but by the time I made it home in 15 minutes all the cheese had congealed and stuck to the wax paper. The lesson is to eat nachos onsite and this n8ght not occur. Ended up with huge chunks of chips held together by cold cheese. Plenty of chicken and guac saved the day. Price was $7.99."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty big now, but the food quality still remains good at least on the chicken dishes that I usually end up getting. The Baja burrito simply contains grilled chicken chunks, guacamole and salsa fresca - simple, but effective. Both the chipotle sauce and green sauce remain my favorites. The guy working at the register must have called me \"sir\" eight times during our three minute interaction which was probably a record. Check-in for a free large drink."}
{"text":"I call this chain..ole reliable. Never had a bad meal here in at least ten years. On this day, tried the grilled chicken taco combo plate classic style. The one thing that wasn't that great was the white sauce they douse the chicken in before it ends up on your tacos. It is not a bad sauce, but I think that might be the same one they use on fish and it doesn't belong on poultry. Regardless, the two tacos for 7 bucks were loaded up on white chicken chunks and mostly lettuce and the chips were super crispy at the location and the rice was above average. I will order no white sauce next time and this will be back to it's usual four stars rating."}
{"text":"Great food for your money, excellent staff, personable and attentive. For a fast food joint, I have to say, you can't go wrong...lots of healthy choices."}
{"text":"Came here for fish taco Tuesday. Walked in and there was small line and the manager(mark) immediately ask to help me. Very good customer service and genuinely happy to help...I could tell by his demeanor and interactions with the customers. For the food and service, I'm definitely coming back here for the fish tacos and customer service."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. You gotta try them."}
{"text":"Cashier asked me 4 times throughout the ordering process if it was dine in or take out.  Actually one time she asked if I wanted to take out or have it to-go. She would stare off then asked another cashier which button for the coastal trio then ask me if I wanted the order to-go, AGAIN. I asked her to confirm my order twice as I was very unsure of her accuracy at that point and the order was still wrong when it came out and I was completely over charged.  We ordered taco plates etc but one person in the party only received 1 taco instead of the plate and it was the wrong taco and we were overcharged for that 1 taco. We had to go back and re-order and half our party was done eating before the others received their food.  All around horrible experience."}
{"text":"My experience at Rubios is always awesome ! Great tasting fresh food and super friendly staff ! My orders are always right on take out and that means a lot. 
The new mango avocado salad is so delicious. The direction Rubios is headed with this new salad and the quinoa bowl is fantastic!!  I haven't been this excited about a salad since .... ever!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots...Friendly staff, great manager, great counter staff and great kitchen staff too.  If something is not right Eddie the manager always makes it better."}
{"text":"One of the better fast casual Mexican restaurants pretty much ever and I don't even eat fish. Always get something with chicken and Rubio has never let me down despite many strange menu changes over the years. In this visit, tried the two taco combo with rice and chips for about 8 bucks (about a buck more than it should be really). The chipotle sauce they drizzle on the chicken makes these tacos have a nice smoky taste. Use the coupon option to get a free large drink and you have a decent, healthy lunch. Lots of high tops at this location and a salsa bar that uses two sides finally."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of time to write a thorough review because so much was wrong with out visit today around 5 pm. I will focus on the fish tacos. The fish was way over battered. They were as big as a hoagie roll. Also the corn tortillas were so tough you couldn't bite them. My daughter left all three on the plate. We are here at a horse show and had to get back so I couldn't bother with the guy at the counter (another issue with our visit). I understand why the place was so empty"}
{"text":"Just had a lunch at this location. The staff are nice. I had the mango mahi mahi Fish tacos plate, it was very tasty and good. I love their sauce bar."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Rubio's in the Monte Carlo food court.  Best restaurant there because I'm in love with the famous beer battered fried fish tacos and burritos.  

Service was a bit slow, but the wait was worth it.  Serve yourself sodas."}
{"text":"I used to live in San Diego back in the early 2000s and couldn't get enough of this place, so when I found out there had a couple in Vegas...we had to stop by and get our fill! It might not be the Cali air that I'm used to but this spot in Vegas does this grill justice!!! - You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu unless you don't order anything off the menu! haha!"}
{"text":"Fish taco- traditional with chips is so good- made hot and fresh per order.  Chips with the salsa bar is great. Also had the two enchilada dinner- you choose ( I had one cheese- one chicken) with rice and beans for just under $9.  Restaurant quality.  Tortilla soup thick with rice, chicken and seasoned nicely served with two tortillas- can be a meal in itself. For a fast quick meal at the resort or while gambling you can not beat the quality and the price. Highly recommend. they also serve breakfast burritos in the am but did not have a chance to try them"}
{"text":"I love their taco fish! It is incredible, nice place, and friendly staff. super clean, I also like to eat the shrimp burrito is delicious"}
{"text":"I come here once or twice a week. All the day shift employees know me by first time and the cashier has a good idea what I'll order. This is to say I have a lot of experience with this restaurant and can vouch for these guys. This is a great establishment. Clean, well prepared food. Environmentally conscience. Get their bowls, try their gourmet tacos, salsa bar is always fresh. It's a great choice for fresh and fairly healthy food."}
{"text":"The food had good taste to it and the service was fine. But when the cost is factored in I have to drop it a star because the portion size of their $7.29 burritos did not match up, and no beans or rice come at that price, just a handful of chips. We've certainly had more authentic Mexican food for less money.  

The fish tacos were good, too, but again the coat should have meant three tacos. 

The steak was tender, the chicken in the burritos had good flavor, and the salsa bar is a nice touch.  So it was a decent place, just overpriced."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeee this location. I would come here a few times a week it seemed to get food for my boss and I. I always have a pretty complicated order but they always get it right which is refreshing to see! The Hispanic women and the younger man with brown hair that work up front are AWESOME and so sweet!  I live in north Phoenix and sometimes I'd rather just drive to this location just for the awesome customer service, attentiveness and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food & atmosphere. Every time! The staff managers; Matt & Nancy are wonderful. They are pleasant & very accommodating! Rayna & Patrick are cashiers--super helpful, friendly & always see them doing \"busy work\" when all customers have been served. Love this location & their wonderful staff! Fish tacos are on point!"}
{"text":"I just ordered online from this location (order 214109) and couldn't help but to review. This location is soooo annoying! Every time I walk in and wait under the sign \"pick up orders here\" only to be ignored by the cashier who has ZERO customers in line! This time was a short Hispanic chick with no personality.  I asked for jalapeños (since they had none out) and a plastic fork (after all it was a to go order) and omg, she had attitude. Honestly I was not rude and and always try to be pleasant, but little miss attitude was obviously not happy being there! My order was simple, bean burrito with extra beans....seriously why do they always put very little beans in a bean burrito?!!! It's hard to see in the picture but I'm not a heavy eater, but rubios please put beans in a bean burrito!! As I've reviewed rubios before, I really like their no fried beans...they really are good! I just wish this location would work on employee's personalities and assigning someone to get online orders out...this isn't the first time it has happened at this location...it's consistent. I give this location two stars only because this vegetarian likes their beans! A lack of seamless service and beans in my burrito wiped away the other 3 stars!

I tired to reply to Lucas' comment but the link did not work...I will be happy to share my experience with a Rubio's team me

May 10, 2018 update - I gave this locations another try since I was nearby. I have to say my experience was much improved compared to my original experience! The first experience was horrible and although Lucas attached a link for staff to reach out to me, the link never worked.  I would assume the Rubios management addressed the issues any ways. As I waited for my order, a respectful Hispanic gentleman (I was in a hurry! sorry I didn't get his name...next time!) politely asked me to give him a second and handed me my food shortly after. I ordered the California bowl with veggies  again...thanks to The Ahwatukee manager who got me addicted to them! They made it perfectly at this location...it's really good when made right! I don't like to have to complain to get what I paid for, but I appreciate the improved experience....Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Good prices, delicious tacos, and a salsa bar, what more could you want?

Keep in mind this is a quick service Mexican restaurant (order at the counter and seat yourself), but that doesn't degrade the food quality. Great for lunch or a quick, casual dinner.  Classic tacos with any of the meat options are a win!"}
{"text":"I get the same thing everytime I go to Rubios. Chicken burrito especial enchalada style with the green sauce, never red. I ordered this here for the first time. The girl had no idea what I was talking about. I had to explain it. Not only did it take forever to get my order ( and people who ordered after me got their food first) but when I finally got my food, it was wrong. Then the lady proceeded to argue with me about my burrito.  Hello, I know what I want to eat!  When she handed it back to the cook, the cook said very loudly that my cashier rung it up wrong... great! It still wasn't the right order. the chips were way over salted!! I had to put half aside due to one whole side of the chip covered entirely in salt! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Service is a little slower than usual, but the product is worth the wait...love the burittos!!"}
{"text":"Slow, slow, and slower.
Really, can't anyone multitask? This service would not fly at in and out burger. Lines to the door..ready to walk out."}
{"text":"I used to love this rubios, until they got rude. I prefer to call in my food on my lunch break so that it's ready when I get there. Rubios apparently doesn't hire anyone to answer the phone, even though they have cashiers and managers ALWAYS standing around. They will let you call 5-10 times before answering. Seriously, how hard is it to add \"answer the phone\" into a minimum wage job description anyways? So after two months of this I went to the manager, who sounded 18. I expressed that I hadn't been able to get through and had been taking my business to Baja Fresh, and she said I'd be better off going to Baja Fresh and also that the phone is a low priority for them. If a LANDLINE phone was ringing off the hook at an establishment I would not want to be there. So, that doesn't make me want to go IN to eat at rubios either, sweetie. Waiting for a call from the owner, most likely done with this joint."}
{"text":"Fish Taco Tuesday is the greatest thing ever created. I get like 8 for my self. They are amazing and fresh and cheap. The place is nice and I love the salsa bar! I can be here everyday to be honest! You want good American Mexican food I would come here."}
{"text":"I ordered nachos, they were pretty good but I was dissapointed with the small amount of cheese and the fact that the cheese was not melted much if at all.  Seemed like the cheese was expected to just melt from the heat of the other items on the nachos.  Service was pretty good and the area seemed clean."}
{"text":"First time at this Rubios location was a delight. Very friendly staff and the food was delicious to say the least. Plan on making this location one of my main spots when I am craving nachos with extra sour cream."}
{"text":"Excellent Fish Taco Tuesday! The fish tacos are amazing and for $1.50 each on Tuesday what a deal! I highly recommend a visit on Tuesday."}
{"text":"My wife and I are hooked on your fish tacos. They are the best we have ever eaten and we have gone coast to coast and have tried some amazing fish tacos and other tasty  bites. The fish is always fresh and delicious and put in a warm fresh corn tortilla grilled to perfection makes this taco such a treat. Incredible and tasty and truly the best fish taco on this planet!!"}
{"text":"First timer, have a gluten allergy so I wanted to make sure I could eat there. They have a graph that shows what is wheat free. Ordered mahi tacos with chips and rice. I despise beans and specifically mentioned no beans. Go the food to go.  Guess what????!!!! Beans! So now you get 2 stars. And just a side note, their Chips are labeled as wheat free, but they are deep fried, and probably with all the flour.  Typical ignorance."}
{"text":"I am giving this Rubio's 5 stars based on customer service.

The girl who took our order was names Isabella. She was super friendly and helpful. She was patient with us ordering as one person had never been to a Rubio's before and we had a 2 year old running around. She never tried to rush us. She even gave me a coupon for a free churro to save me money on our order. She offered us cups for water while we waited. Then, when they gave us our food to go, everything was exactly as ordered and she even bagged everyone's orders separately so there was no confusion!

By the way, the food was good too! But it was Isabella's customer service that made that meal so nice!"}
{"text":"it was absolutly trash when we went to take out we were there an hour nobody came to serve us never coming again"}
{"text":"The people at the front were great.  She helped me make a decision on salad or tacos.  Great food and helpful people."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos, mmm! A little pricey, but that's expected worth sea food."}
{"text":"I have visited here a two times in the last two weeks, ordering the H Mex Chicken Burrito. Quality is pretty good. Not a bad place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location! The one on 59th Ave tops this one by far! I ordered 2 California bowls for take out. Paid and then they mention that they were out citrus rice and they used the Mexican rice instead. Guess it's okay since I already paid. Anyways I didn't think it was a big deal, it was okay but there were plenty of uncooked or not cooked all the way rice grains. Made for a crunchy meal. All in all I didn't end up eating even half because I was grossed out. Never been so disappointed in this fresh mex restaurant then the location on bell! Again go to the 59th Ave one, the staff is fun and excellent!! The food is consistent and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love the gourmet chicken tacos.  For \"fast food\" it is bit expensive 7-10$ for the combo plate.  I wish a single taco wasn't 3.29$ but it is great.  The kicker for me was the management and staff.  This place about a mile from where I live, so that is a plus for me as well.  But the manager ( 2 so far) have been nothing be the epitome of how a manager should act.

I had just moved to Peoria about a month and half ago and was exploring the nothern Peoria area and seeing what was really close to my house.  I relied heavily on Yelp, and the reviews for this place looked great.  

I walk in and the manager starts small talking with me and I am a big small talker so I mention that I just moved here from Michigan and it is my first time in.  He gave me a FREE fountain pop cup and said \"Welcome to Arizona and Rubios\"  ( You had me at free bro!)  I order the chicken taco plate.  He brings it out to my table and I take a bite.  DELICIOUS food.

He asks if I like fish because their signature dish is the Fish Taco.  I told him I am not a huge fish guy, and 5 minutes later he brings me a FREE fish taco just to try!!

What a nice fast food place!   5 stars for all around awesomeness"}
{"text":"Yippee!!!  Veggie tacos are back!!  How can you not love portobello and poblano grilled on a corn tortilla with grilled cheese and then add chipotle white sauce, rice and a squeeze of lime-sooooo goooood.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I discovered Rubio's about 3 years ago and for about 2 years I was there every friday for lunch.  I could walk in and they would ring up my very specific order right down to the extra chipotle on the side.  It is very nice to see great service like this place.  Fish tacos are great,  guacamole is awesome!

People will say, \"oh, it's like Baja Fresh,\" and I will kindly say \"no, it's way better!\""}
{"text":"My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good."}
{"text":"Rubio's has always been a solid choice - can't recall any bad meals here over the years when I first ran into this place down in San Diego. Lately, everything they seem to come out with is fish related. Tilapia, cod, etc, but since I hate most fish, I wish they would upgrade their chicken with some exotic spices once in awhile. Still, the chicken tacos were pretty solid last night at $7 for two of them in a large corn tortilla with chips and rice. Salsa bar hasn't changed in years and that is another spot where they could be more creative like Baja's mango stuff. Chicken nachos are really good as well."}
{"text":"They changed the recipes for some of the items at this chain. I usually just get the Healthmex burrito here if I visit. The chicken is always white and lean and it comes out to $7.03, so bring a few pennies with you. It just has chicken, black beans, rice and some kind of sauce on the burrito. Always free chips. This location has a decent patio out front, but the tables are too close together in some instances. Salsa bar could use a new recipe as these same four salsa's have been gracing the bar since ten years ago. Only the green and the chipotle are worth eating and the onions have way too much parsley or cilantro - they should separate the items. Still, it's always a good guaranteed, know what your getting kind of place."}
{"text":"Don't get ranch chicken salad it's swimming in too much dressing, too many chips, too much salt on those chips, has a weird taste, literally almost no chicken, tiniest little pieces I have ever seen almost like they ran out of chicken and I got the scraps oh and wheres the lettuce??????  This place doesnt usually screw up."}
{"text":"Really good fresh Baja style Mexican food that is much better than many restaurants in the valley.  One of my newest faves is the blackened tillapia taco.  Low in calories and big on taste.  Just 1 or 2 will fill you up."}
{"text":"The loaded nachos are straight fire. 
Definitely slept on if you aint tried them atleast once.  The fish and shrimp tacos had my brother placing a second order before I even finished my nachos. Lol.
Chill vibes and friendly all the way around. Service is on point and place is pretty clean. They are def worth the try."}
{"text":"I love this Rubio's! The staff here is really nice and remembers you if you're here often enough. The food is always fresh. Taco Tuesdays ($1.50 for a fish taco) is amazing! The salsa is fresh, the food is great, and the staff seems like they actually care if you're having a good experience. I've been to local restaurants and gotten fish tacos that weren't as good as the ones at Rubio's. Plus they have beer. Go and get some!"}
{"text":"I love Rubios but maybe it's because this one is in a casino it's just not as good as the Rubios that are their own stores. The food is not as good and portions are smaller, it seems to take longer to make and I swear it costs more but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"This is my absolute fav place to get fresh mex in las vegas. People are always nice, food is always good, and it's cheerful and clean. Fish tacos are amazing and I never get sick of them. Bean burritos are my kids favorites. I've never had a bad meal and the price is good."}
{"text":"I work right by this Rubio's so I frequently walk over for lunch. They have a great staff but everyone knows I come for the food. My favorite is the California bowl with blackened tilapia and red sauce. I love their unlimited salsa bar too...the diablo sauce is the way to go if you're looking for that extra kick. Sometimes I spurge and get the original fish taco combo plate instead of the bowl. I recently tried the new panko shrimp tacos and they were awesome too! I have my whole office hooked on Rubio's! We get it once a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"Since I won a $50 Rubio's catering gift certificate at a Yelp event, I figured it was time to finally try out Rubio's.

Placing the catering order was very simple and easy. You can do it all online - pick out what you want, when you want to pick it up, etc. (And you can arrange delivery if you want.) And I appreciated that they called me the day before my scheduled pick-up to confirm the order.

When I walked in to pick up the order, the place itself was actually quite nice for a fast food-type place. And some of the pictures of the fish tacos did have me salivating just a little bit. And the menu did appear to be rather expansive.

As soon as I arrived, I was helped immediately. Once I said \"catering pick-up\", they knew my name, knew I had a gift certificate, had my order all packed up and ready to go, etc.

The packaging was pretty nice. It was all in a nice, reusable tote-type bag. On top was a box of utensils, napkins, and plates. And nothing I ordered spilled or leaked or anything.

I ordered two platters - one salad and one quesadilla (mix of some steak and some cheese). Honestly, the quesadillas weren't much to write home about. Good, but nothing different or standout about them - just average. The guacamole that came with them, though, was above average. The salad, while just a salad, was quite tasty. There was plenty of cheese, which I appreciated, and the dressing was deliciously spicy. 

So good service and good food, but nothing that really pushed me to think of it as more than a-ok. However, I do now intend to go back and try out some of their tacos and other items. And probably get some more of that salad dressing."}
{"text":"So I usually love taco  Tuesday at Rubios, but this location is very slow and the tacos don't seem as good as the location on Guadalupe and McClintock. It's not horrible, it's just ok..."}
{"text":"Fish tacos for the win."}
{"text":"Rubio's is good, light and tasty Baja Mexican food. I dig the concept, vibe and food. Definitely a favorite! Beats Qdoba and Chipotle hands down."}
{"text":"Love this place. We lunch here at least once a week. Clean, friendly, and great burritos and fish tacos."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rubio's. When I need my fix I go to the one off of Sahara and fort Apache. The food is absolutely delicious. It taste fresh, I have never had bad food. I usually order the original two Fish taco plate it comes with beans and chips. My kids love their bean burritos."}
{"text":"Love Rubios. They have Wild Alaskan Coho Salmon & Pollock. I always get the Original Fish Taco 2 Taco plate. It's fresh and delicious. Plus they have the most amazing brewed teas. They have a passion fruit, Mango & regular brewed teas. As an extra bonus they have Mexican Coke. It's the only soda I'm willing to drink."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and enjoyed our visit. The restaurant was clean, bright and had a happy vibe. The customer service was fantastic and the food was scrumptious. I recommend this location and will return if in the area again."}
{"text":"I always thought this was a fish taco place... a friend dragged me here a few months ago and made me try the steak gourmet tacos. !!! So good! I come every week now. The chicken ones are really good. The chipotle ranch is excellent. I always get extra to put it on my beans."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, however today I experienced some of the worst customer service I have ever received from the girls cashiering at the front. They treated me like I was an annoyance and just walked away when I told them (VERY NICELY) that my order was made wrong. I mean, if they wanted to make it obvious that they hated their job, they achieved their goal."}
{"text":"i really liked this place. it was clean and quite. nicely tucked in the corner of this plaza it was a beautiful day to eat outside on the picnic area. i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food I got here. I really was not expecting too much but now I will definitely have to make regular stops here for lunch with my family"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I heard of $1.25 fish taco Tuesdays and every Tuesday has been the same routine: get out of work, call Rubio's, order 3 flour fish tacos, and pick em up on my way to choir practice.  Every time I call and tell them my name, Jesus always recognizes me when I come to pick them up. Jesus brings back the comfort of being a regular at your favorite place and he always make that exception of ringing me as soon as I wall through those doors. Thumbs up for Jesus and the staff at Rubio's on Lake Mead! Happy eating! :)"}
{"text":"I want to make clear that I have been a long-term, loyal customer of Rubios at this location for many years. I've gone through periods of time where I've eaten lunch there four to six times per week. However, despite the fact that I still like the food, I simply cannot visit this location any longer. For the better part of the summer, this restaurant has been unbearable to eat in. Temperatures inside are easily 85 degrees or higher, and the only people I feel worse for than the customers, are the poor employees that have to work under those conditions. I went there three weeks ago, stayed for a few minutes to eat, and then had to leave as I was sweating in my food. Today, on the way home from work, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought perhaps their air conditioner just wasn't working that day. Unfortunately, I walked in and immediately realized that this isn't a matter of the air conditioner not working, but management trying to save money on cooling costs in one of the hottest states in the world, during the hottest time of the year. In years past, this location has been traditionally a blessing on a hot day. I've always been able to count on the temperature at a cool temperature, making each visit comfortable and pleasant. I can state unequivocally that I refuse to visit this restaurant again until I get some assurance that management is aware of this issue, and is attempting to address the problem."}
{"text":"It's fine. Clearly a chain. Good service. Decent food. Not authentic. A little speedy for what you get."}
{"text":"This review is for this location's catering - the manager Hugo was able to juggle their delivery schedule to accommodate my order on short notice and even deliver an order that was below their normal delivery minimum because it was close enough to another scheduled delivery he had. My clients loved the food (not your typical boring lunch meeting sandwiches or pizza) and everything went smoothly with the delivery - the order was accurate, there were enough plates/napkins/cups/lemons and sugar for the iced tea, etc. I really appreciated Hugo's willingness to accommodate me and I would highly recommend this Rubios location's catering services to anybody. Because of this great experience, I will definitely make a point to order from them again if I have the chance."}
{"text":"Wow my boyfriend took me here for my first time and it is definitely my new favorite restaurant! I got the mix and match tacos one was the original fish taco and the cilantro lime sea bass (I think is what it was called) and they were both absolutely delicious!!! They have 4 sauces to choose from but really the only good one was the green sauce which is great. I read on the menu that the corn tortillas are made with non-GMO corn which is great news. Overall very good restaurant and I will definitely make it my new regular spot!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Greeted promptly and employees make the effort to bring the food out to you. Salmon burrito is my favorite."}
{"text":"I love getting fish tacos at Rubio's, but this location is terrible. The place itself was dirty, and the cashier who took my order couldn't even take basic instructions on what I wanted. The fish tacos had more cabbage than fish in them, and their disgusting pinto beans were super diluted and watery. This place makes the Rubio's in the mall look like the creme de la creme of fish tacos. 

I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Crappy service and ever crappier food."}
{"text":"The service at this Rubios is great! The woman that helped me had a big smile and was super friendly. My food came out quick and was delicious as always. While I mark a star off, I am saddened that they don't have whole wheat tortillas anymore. The Baja Grill Chicken Burrito was still yummy though."}
{"text":"The last time before this visit that I went to a Rubio's, it was in Long Beach and they were hella rude when I asked if they could make tacos without meat.

While vegan tacos aren't on the menu at all, this location is perfectly willing to not only meet my request, but make it just as delicious as anything else they offer. All their tortillas are dairy-free, and their corn tortillas are gluten and dairy-free, with the nutrition info made easily available on their website, and the staff is careful to make sure you don't accidentally get cheese on your order.

Not too shabby for a chain. Come to Canada, please."}
{"text":"Always great... always fast... beware the hispanic woman with longer brown hair... she looks like she has an attitude before you even talk to her. She \"forgot\" to put my phone order in and I had to sit for 15 minutes while I watched walk in customers get their food before me... upset?? YOU BETCHA!!! Besides her the rest of the employees are amazing and friendly.

Try that bacon shrimp burrito... HEAVEN!!!"}
{"text":"My kids like the food here so I take them sparingly.  The cleanliness has always been a concern so I now only do take out.  I'm sitting here now and we're 25 minutes into a take out order for my 12-year old daughter and myself.

This will be our last Rubio visit.  Very disappointed.  I'm not the only one sitting in the dining room wondering what's going on.  We're all stunned and confused."}
{"text":"Great price point. Fresh n yummy Ono tacos."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I ordered 2 tacos to go. When I got home they were soaked through in sauce. When I opened the wrapping I thought ewww. They were so messy & unappetizing looking. But sometimes it tastes better than it looks. Nope.  The fish coating was terrible tasting. The sauce was gross. I was so disappointed but I couldn't believe they world serve such ugly & disgusting food. I wanted to take it back & ask if the cooks if they'd eat that."}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  Just ordered.  Had to wipe down table and seats myself.  It wasn't that busy, yet all the tables and seats were dirty.  No one out here wiping anything down.
4 to 5 people behind counter yet no one cleaning"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Rubio's in Vegas. Great service, great food....and even though I order the same thing most of the time (most of the employees know my order when I walk in the door) for whatever reason, it's the best here....perfect amount of each ingredient. Love it that there's a salsa bar that I can get myself. Wish they served beer here....that would make it a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"Brandon and staff had great customer service. Food was great as usual. Restaurant tidy and clean. Salsa bar stocked and neat. Try the classic grilled shrimp burrito"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time. Its been years since I've been to a Rubios. I gotta say Ive been missing out! As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the cashier I believe his name was Nick. He had very great costumer service and made our visit really great. I honestly had no idea what to order, i decided to go with a bowl and my fiancé got a burrito. When we got home and tasted our food we just looked at each other in disbelief. We didn't expect much from the taste. But we both LOVED what we ordered. He even said it was one of the best tasting burritos he's had in a while. Prices are also reasonable! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Yum - ordered the Balsamic Veggie Salad with grilled veggies. Hubby ordered the Cilantro Lime Burrito which he subbed brown rice and black beans for the tortilla: so good and filling! Good to have healthier food options; fast, friendly service and would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"This was the best fish taco I've ever had!  I've never had a fish taco before, but it probably will remain in the top anyway.  It was a flavor explosion of beer battered fish, crunchy cabbage, guac, and two sauces mixed together.  One was red, and one was white.  I have NO clue what they were, but they mixed together to create a delicious flavor explosion that made my taste buds dance with appreciation.  

The side of pinto beans is pretty esoteric, more soupy than you'd normally get, and with the chips you get access to the complimentary salsa bar, which has lots of options.  

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome food and at times, great people working there. The managers are all good people, however some should be more relaxed and helpful to the paying customer.  Being suspicious of new customers is not cool.  

I use to be a regular, however I have since switched location and have been going to that location for over a year now.  Maybe management at the Serene store has changed since then.  I will not go back to find out."}
{"text":"They have really good fish tacos. They don't skimp u on the fish like some places do. I can't complain about decent fast Mexican food. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I just can't bring myself to rave about Rubios.  I know a lot of my classmates love this place, but for the life of me, I can't understand why.  It's better than Del Taco, but that's not saying much.  The food is simply entirely unremarkable.  Almost every time I've been here, the chips and beans they toss on to almost every plate have that stale 'left under a lamp too long' crunch to them.

Now, I'll offer one caveat: I've not tried their seafood tacos, and I hear they're quite good.  I'm willing to give them a try.  So at some point, I'll give this an update."}
{"text":"Just like the Rubio's places in California! The quality here is actually VERY good for a restaurant chain in a food court. If you want to have a great meal, I suggest getting a Big Burrito Especial with a World Famous Fish Taco."}
{"text":"Becoming regular here for tacos on the go. It's either this place or another down the street if I'm deciding to grab Mexican to go. They get the food orders right and their quality check before they hand you the bag is a great idea. Place is ok with cleanliness and that even goes for the salsa bar where people tend to leave a mess."}
{"text":"Always awesome food here and top quality. Shrimp tacos are always great. Great managers as well. Very friendly staff. My constant go to place."}
{"text":"Terrible food and even worse prices. Plus why ask me for my name when I'm your only patron? 

The steak and bacon tacos were barely edible. I wanted to try something different since we don't have this chain in the Windy City but I was not impressed. The food was so terrible I got McDonald's to make up for it!

Visit Date: 11/16/09"}
{"text":"I give Rubio's 5 stars two reasons great customer service even at rush hour lunch time and for the shrimp filled burrito. I thought they were going to be stingy with the shrimp but it was loaded throughout the burrito. When I first bit into it I got three shrimp. I thought \"awe man all the shrimp are in one end of the burrito\" but it wasn't it was throughout until the last bite!"}
{"text":"I tried the lobster burrito it was good not great, The beans not too good , next time I will just get the burrito. Kinda pricey 32$ for 3 people."}
{"text":"Love the food here, love how the fish tacos don't really get that fishy taste. People here are honestly the sweetest!"}
{"text":"First,  they no longer have talapia, this sucks. The Ono fish that replaced it was tough and tasted fishy, not happy at all.
Second, when you ask for light rice, it means LIGHT RICE, not the normal amount, you can put more lettuce or beans, wouldn't be offended. But I am offended when there are still gobs of rice and barely any lettuce or beans at all!!!
Third, the fresh made chips would be great if weren't oil soaked and chewy...nasty!!

My husband's Salmon California Bowl looked great, and he said it tasted pretty good. But when you order no rice and extra beans, you could put a little extra lettuce for filler...

What happened? Did this location flush it down the toilet? So sad..."}
{"text":"Good service and amazing food always! This is my taco Tuesday spot! Also, they serve alcohol so what more could you want? I love EVERYTHING I've tried but the fish taco especial and gourmet shrimp tacos are my jam"}
{"text":"Best fast Mexican food for sure! Everything is made with quality ingredients that you can clearly tell. I always get the gourmet shrimp and steak tacos. So good"}
{"text":"I've been to this location about four times now and it has been consistently good. Everything always tastes fresh and the service is fast and friendly. 

They always take the time to carefully package the food so that it doesn't move around and spill in the car; which is appreciated."}
{"text":"Totally CHOKED.

Food - good, hot, fresh, as I expect it.
Service - friendly & efficient.
Meets expectations?  NO!

OK, so the worst thing a chain can do is dump consistency.  Rubio's advertises Fish Taco Tuesday ($1/taco) \"at participating locations\" and every one I've ever been into - and that means all over California - honors it.  But NOT Red Rock!  As if I knew that....

So when I plug Rubio's into the GPS on a Tuesday in response to my man's fish taco craving, drive out of my way, leave him in the car waiting while I enter a casino & play hide-&-seek to find Rubios in the back corner in a food court (all the while in cycling gear while I dive amongst rows of slot machines I might add - as in hubby really had a fish taco deal craving), order & then discover I'm being charged full pop because they don't participate?  I'm ANNOYED. Now I'm hungry, and my SO will be profoundly grumpy if I don't return with fish tacos.  

HUNGRY, ANNOYED and GRUMPY!!!

Seriously, folks.  If you've bought a franchise or opened another company store under the Rubio's banner with the Rubio's menu because you want the Rubio's reputation, ya better freakin' offer the Rubio's specials.  

Choked with you. True, I place this same order any day of the week that a craving hits regardless of the price, and loved my non-greasy carnitas street tacos and he had a craving satisfied.  Difference is I'll NEVER repeat a visit to this location because when it's Tuesday I want the discount.  Your brothers-in-arms will win out."}
{"text":"I would go on depth about how awesome their fish tacos are but my amazing food awaits"}
{"text":"This is the worst Rubio's in Phoenix. Watch this restaurant slowly go down hill, and they finally hit rock bottom today. The beans were running and undercooked, and I can get better tacos at Del Taco. Do eat at Rubio's but not this one!"}
{"text":"Just came back from another successful fish taco Tuesday mission.  Every Tuesday after 3:30 they have fish tacos for $1.75 each.   Or you can get the upgraded version for 25 cents more which has guacamole and cheese.   Worth it in my opinion.   

The only reason it's not a 5 star experience is because the fish is mostly breeding.  If it was more meat under that delicious airy breeding then I'd give it 5 stars.  

What is 5 stars???  Answer: The service for a casual Mexican food place (the wait time and friendliness of the staff) and the selection of sauces.   

Fish tacos are almost thebomb.com status.   But not quite."}
{"text":"Best service and food!! Everything is always fresh and tastes amazing! I come here with my mom every few weeks, we always try something new and EVERY time the food is great:)"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were really good and the sauce selections aren't lacking."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gourmet Steak taco plate with two taco's and it came with chips and pintos beans The tacos were very good as were the chips. The pinto beans left much to be desired and lowered the rating remember to ask for rice instead of the beans. The mango and the regular Iced teas were also good with both lemon and lime added."}
{"text":"Great location, food quality is exceptional. Really love their salsas. Staff is super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I used to eat their fish tacos years ago and I remembered them to be decent. We tried these again yesterday for their $1.50 Tues special and the fish was so dry, and the batter thick and hard. The corn tortilla also was very thick and dense, though that was how I remembered them.

The salsas are nothing special. The mild is very very mild. No spice at all. Though if you like really spicy, there are two salsas in squeeze bottles next to the salsa bar and are very hot!

However the staff is friendly and competent, though I'll probably not be back."}
{"text":"First time stop for us.  

yes, it is a step above a taco bell or other fast food Mexican food joint. 

No, it is not fine dining.  

The food was OK, the table delivery of the items is nice.  we assumed this means the food was made fresh for us and there might have been some attention to quality product.

The food was tasting, the missus had the shrimp tacos and I ahd a combination plate of shrimp burrito and fish tacos.  I am not a huge fan of rice and beans in my burrito and so was a bit disappointed by the quantity of the rice and beans in burrito, but that was my fault.

The amount of chips served with the combo platter was a bit slim, but they offered a side dish of chips on the menu.

The salsa bar was a nice, if not small, touch.

We may go again if the urge for fish tacos strikes us."}
{"text":"If you are from San Diego this is were you eat if you want to remember Mission Beach."}
{"text":"OMFG, everybody in my office was going GaGa over free food!!  How do you cheer up a bunch of grumpy employees sweating like pigs because the A/C wasn't working in the office.  Free burritos!!!!  It was the talk of the office all day.  Hey did you get your free burrito?  \"Yes, now leave me alone.  Go away\"

I only came here because of the free coupon for the Burrito Especial they're promoting for the Las Vegas Film Festival.  The only other time I've eaten at a Rubio's I had the fish tacos.  I figured I would never return. But....................

Anytime, there's free food you expect the long lines and long wait for your food.  But I must commend the people running this place efficiently for being so busy.  Very well organized and they had portable vibrators so you knew when your order was ready.  

I grew up in San Francisco (Land of the Taquerias) and being a burrito snob and typically despise chains like Chipotle, Baja Fresh and Rubio's so I wasn't expecting much.  But nobody should ever go here because of \"authenticy\".  But as for the burrito itself eeh it was aiight.  The good was that the steak or chicken tasted straight from the grill.  The guacamole tasted fresh and not like the kind that's processed in a plastic container.  But is it $8 good?  That's debatable depending on your standards.  But the good news is I have yet to have an immediate \"closed-door meeting\" today!  Usually bad \"mexican food\" leads to a quick meeting for most people.  

With all that said, I don't see myself returning anytime soon.  I'll stick with my favorite mainstay taquerias that serve my beloved Lengua, Al Pastor and Carnitas options for authenticity."}
{"text":"This place was terrible I got a chicken quesadilla and it wasn't that great, but I only had 30 mins before the show I was seeing started. Moral of the story after my show I was shittin and vomiting for the last 18 plus hours. With that being said I give this place two middle fingers and I hope they get shutdown."}
{"text":"Before I start, understand that my family and I love Rubio's and have eaten at several locations throughout multiple states.  It is only unfortunate that this particular location is the one nearest our home.  The problem lies solely on the patio location.  The proximity to the 101 frontage road and the neighboring pub patio leaves the possibility that you will be huffing either exhaust fumes or cigarette smoke dependent on the prevailing wind if you choose to dine al fresco.  I highly recommend that you eat inside or get your food to-go.  The cuisine never disappoints but the patio location is a big drawback."}
{"text":"I barely ever do reviews on Yelp but I felt obligated to do so after having lunch here today. I was here recently and both times had Sue ring me up. She is the manager there and I can't help but have a smile on my face while talking to her and watching her work. Not only is she extremely hard working but the most kind and genuine woman I've ever seen in customer service. All I could think about was how I hoped someone told her how amazing of a manager she is, & if not, I will! Thank you Sue for an amazing experience. The food was good, but the service was excellent and I will be back again in hopes to see her again."}
{"text":"I can imagine the owner of this location is a bit worried since it has only been open a few months as have all in this center and Mervin's along with Circuit City are going out of business. What a way to start a business. 

I have not tried this place simply because I did eat at one on the other side of town and did not like it. 

Gus was in the mood so we stopped in on our way home. We both got the fiesta salad which I guess is kind of an odd choice but there you go. 

A Very nice young man takes our order, same nice guy brings our food to us. As I look around I notice all the employees are pretty good looking. 

The salads looked small, but as we ate found them to be very filling. Nice crisp ingredients and the chicken had a nice char flavour too. So now I know how stupid I am for judging one restaurant buy a sister store. 

aYUP we will be back."}
{"text":"I have to admit, i'm a sucker for the Rubio's Baja Chicken Salad! It is my go-to lazy dinner when Ben is out of town and I don't feel like cooking for one because it is somewhat healthy and oh so good! I have a few favorite healthy + quick places that are in the rotation and Rubio's is always one of them! This location is always friendly, quick, and super clean. I'm also totally obsessed with salsa bars and Rubio's has a great one! Pro tip: you can ask for a bigger salsa cup so that you don't have to fill up 10 little ones like me! ;) 

When i'm feeling like a fish taco, believe it or not, the original crispy fish taco from Rubio's is by far one of the best that i've ever had. My absolute favorite fish tacos are from the Brigantine in San Diego and this is a close second! It is SO yum!!! Their Taco Tuesday specials are a total win for the taco lovers out there!

I'll be back again soon when I don't feel like cooking! :)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is very friendly. I come here at least every other week on my lunch break. My food never takes more than 10mins and it's always delicious"}
{"text":"This used to be a really well run location,  but has steadily gone downhill.   Today was the worst and I will not be returning.   20 minutes to receive food.   I asked to talk with the manager and she seemed to care less.   She said they were backed up and offered no type of apology.   She asked if I wanted chips and walked away.   Someone did bring chips out about a minute before the food arrived.   My meal already had chips.   Lots of people waiting,  soda machine drain  was backed up and overflowing on to the floor.   Utensil area a mess,  trash cans overflowing.   Food prep line  a completely.   See included pictures."}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian and/or vegan goldmine! For $5 I get the kids meal (sorry, can't handle the big portions of the regular entrée items) with a bean and cheese burrito but instead of cheese I do rice. For my sides I get more rice and beans, a small drink, and as much salsa as your heart desires. I don't think I can ask for a better lunch for that price. 

The staff is always so very kind and friendly. Each time I'm pleasantly reminded that there are good people in this world. They're genuine too - it's not fake or forced. 

I've never had a bad meal here in 10+ years. Rubio's is hands down my favorite chain cuisine. They always have promotions and freebies, so be sure to sign up for their newsletter!"}
{"text":"I'm done with these guys. When I called in they NEVER seem to get my order right. That means I need to stand there with part of my order getting cold while they fix the part of the order that was missing or I don't discover it until I get home and someone goes without food. We stopped going here because of this. They we tried delivery and Grub hub.  Same problem. WHen we called they kept me on hold for 15 minutes while they investigated.  They came back and said they would refund me and I could order the missing items again if I still wanted them.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Again someone went without food. NO MORE!"}
{"text":"Alright ,so I have been here a time or two. Maybe about 20 times to be exact.
Every time I have ever been here, I have never been dissapointed.
This place is great!
The food is great, the service is good and fast.
The place is spotlessly clean. They seem to always be busy.
They are busy I am sure because,everyone feels the way that I do.
This place is great!
I really like all the different salas they offer and you can have as much as you like!
Thank you Rubios for always being delish! As well as always being fresh and having really great tasting fish tacos."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  good portions,  great flavor. Had the mahi Mahi tacos.  Tortilla soup was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a very solid place for you to go for lunch. The Oaxaca smoky tacos were fantastic! Usually every time we go hear the food is out of this world. Manager Mark is very attentive and his staff is as well.

The salsa bar and the smoky chipotle sauce should not be missed. You'll find some of the best fish tacos in town right here. Don't delay, go today."}
{"text":"I don't understand why it's so hard to make the correct salad (ordered two chopped salads with shrimp and when we got home, they turned out to be the chipotle california with chicken) I had to go back to the restaurant in order to fix the issue, when I walk in the kitchen is blaring their weird trap music on their phones and making snapchats and basically yelling. I don't know how the guests who were eating in the lobby weren't losing their minds. Food was good when it was correct, but I don't want to hear your weird music. Thanks."}
{"text":"Very good Rubio's, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and don't have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean."}
{"text":"The customer service I received here was amazing. Joey, I think, was one the workers there and he gave me and my family exceptional service. He was incredibly patient and kind to us. Definitely coming back here when I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"Always fresh. Loved the shrimp burrito and fish tacos. If you are really looking to splurge, try the Baja Platter."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times.  Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staff here is always Super Friendly. I only come here on Tuesday for their $1.50 fish tacos after 2pm.  I get a nice heaping slab of fish in my taco, I LOVE IT! :) I always get it with extra white sauce and I go to their condiment bar and load up on the onion cilantro topping. Might I add the food is always made to order here always FRESH. Other Rubio locations that I have been to is not up to par with this Green Valley location. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The Chief Development officer I work with used to have a similar position at Rubios corporate years ago-he basically would research and choose the sites for future Rubio locations.  Not only did he do a great job on the sites, he also got to eat at Rubios café every day (at a discount!).  That's the job I want!

The chicken burrito especiale is probably my favorite burrito around, especially for fast casual dining.  Top it with some of their excellent mild salsa and chopped onions and cilantro and it's a lunch I haven't grown tired of.  The meal comes with chips so grab some extra salsa!

This location at Desert ridge has a great outside seating , either on their own patio area or by the splash pad where the people watching easily trumps Instagram.

Like most fast causal restaurants, this locations turns staff and management often but they always seem to land on their feet with a quality  team that keeps the place clean and the food excellent.  One of my go-to lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price, great rice, beans and their gourmet shrimp tacos made to order"}
{"text":"This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers."}
{"text":"I am happy to see the management has changed at this Rubio's. I stopped going to this store due to poor customer service and rude attitudes by staff. I went in last week not knowing what I would find. I was pleasantly surprised with the customer service, the staff was great, and the new manager is awesome. He took time to greet and welcome us. The store was clean, my order was correct and I enjoyed eating in a well managed store. I will continue eating at this restaurant/store if it continues to be operated by a competent and caring manager. This manager is an asset to Rubio's."}
{"text":"I know Rubios has a gluten free menu, so I asked the cashier for it.  He said they don't have one.  As he was talking, the manager type person came over and told me that they cannot guarantee me anything is gluten free because of cross contamination.  I told him I knew about that and told him I know the tacos are gluten free but need to know about sides.  Then he told me again about cross contamination but the tacos are gluten free.  I repeat that I just want to know about sides and he finally tells me that all the sides are fine.  I seem to remember that not all the sides are on their GF menu but I went ahead and ordered.  

Restaurants need to have their GF menus on their websites.  They need to have them in all their stores (the one at desert ridge had a gluten free menu).  Also, I do not need to be lectured twice about cross contamination.  If I am gluten free, I already know I am taking that risk at ANY restaurant. 

This was a frustrating experience.  I will not be going to Rubios again until they have a GF menu online."}
{"text":"We visited Rubio's for the first time in quite a while this evening.  It won't be the last.  The blackened tilapia tacos are absolutely wonderful.  The dressing and coleslaw surrounding the perfectly prepared tilapia were delicious.  I'm not a fan of cilantro, but the cilantro was so delicate, I didn't even notice it.  The platter came with 2 tacos, refried beans, and tortilla chips made right there in the restaurant.  The beans and chips were a nice complement to the star of the show...the tacos.

One caution:  The blackening made the tacos very spicy with more than a little heat.  I loved it, but if you like your food mild, I'd think about a different menu item."}
{"text":"Rubio's *used* to have a packed-with-shrimp Shrimp Burrito. Now they limit the number of shrimp per burrito to eight (8) per burrito, so it ends up being pretty much all rice and beans. The shrimp got smaller, too: they used to use a 36/40 count shrimp size, now they're using 41/45 or smaller shrimp size (my best guess.)

I understand that sometimes product offerings get smaller as margins are protected at chain restaurants (e.g. the Big Mac is tiny nowadays, the Burger King hamburger is bite-sized now.) But, with a Chipotle exactly one block away, you'd think that the franchise owner here would ensure that customers are getting their money's worth. In the middle of my burrito there was a pretty big triple fold of excess overlapped tortilla - meaning the burrito was much smaller than it should of been.

If Rubio's keeps this up, they will go down like Circuit City."}
{"text":"Awesome food. It's Friday, so meat for this Catholic. I ordered Blackened Mahi and an OG Taco. It was sooo good.  The cashier was super cool,  he gave me my chips first and that's cool because I was starving.  Store was clean. Highly recommend this location if you are in this area."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend, myself, and her Daughter came here after a local gymnastics tournament.  Simply put, everything was great!  The customer service was awesome and friendly!  The food as always was excellent!

In the mood for healthy food with some spice, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"The tacos are very good, but the beans and rice are below average. I expect better quality for the price. That being said i'm sure i'll be back to try it again in a few months."}
{"text":"I was sooooo missing Rubios since I left Cali and I finally found one! And let me tell you thee customer service smiles and satisfaction I received from Chelsea & Crystal was absolutely amazing!!! Chelsea went out of her way to make me thee best burrito as weird and picky as I am!!! Man BRAVO!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving a fish taco and this place was exactly what I was looking for! The tacos were creative and fresh. I loooooved the soy ginger fish taco. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I eat at Rubio's here and there but have never been to this location before. I loved the food as always and I was particularly impressed by the girl Bri who worked there. She was very happy and smiley while she was taking my order. I watched as she interacted with other guests (I have been in the restaurant business too) and I was impressed by how she handled herself and other guests. I think she is a great employee and I wanted to share that. I always love the salsa bar with chips! Yum!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy the grilled fish tacos, my favorite is any variety of blackened with Ono-Ono (sp?) being my most recent choice.  Can't speak to the rest of the menu but anytime I'm near one when I'm hungry won't miss to opportunity, one is enough, two are filling."}
{"text":"Rubio's is my go to food court choice. Chicken taco platter for me, with beans. The tacos are good, not the best in town but good. The beans are good and their chips are good. It's good. They have several salsas to choice from, a picante, a regular red salsa, a tomatillo salsa and a hotter salsa that I've never paid attention to. All are good but their regular red salsa is a little on the sweet side, which is not what I want my salsa to taste like. But again over all a decent taco."}
{"text":"Rubio's helps me keep my diet, so I can eat out more often, haha.  This is my go to Rubio's after the gym.  As another yelper mentioned, the location is a little tricky and sometimes it is hard to find a parking spot.  Francisco, the manager is very personable and accommodating.  They have a few choices that are a lot healthier and they even make stuff for me that is not in the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great Rubio's, I don't know if there is new management but it seems so much nicer than a few years back.  I stopped by with the twins to see if they would eat here. There are so many happy meals I want to give them.  To my surprise, they loved the chicken taquitos.  They devoured them.  I am so happy I have another option when I am out with them.  The employees are very nice and keep the place very clean."}
{"text":"What can I say, Rubio's rocks.  I can go to almost any of them and they are very graceful and accommodating to my diet needs.  This one is on the way to my kids old school, so I could stop here and get some to go items.  The manager and employees are very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious clean 
best first fish burrito I ever taste
But I think its a pricey"}
{"text":"Ok, so we know it's a chain and have seen plenty of locations everywhere. I'm giving a full 4 stars for this location because of the manager on duty the day I visited. The employees were all kept busy and the orderliness of the place showed that. I was hesitant to try the fish tacos because I'm just getting into fish (kinda) and usually chicken-out, literally, when it comes to tacos! But, the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special, that I couldn't resist. Glad I couldn't! Delish, even for being \"slightly fishy\", and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff!"}
{"text":"I had a replacement order from a previous order. 1st order extra shrimp & salmon on my taco plates. I was charged for the extras.But was not on the food, and no extra shrimp, and sauce running all over it. My order i called and talked to Rudy, and explained several time my order to be replaced, and all the sauces on the side. Get home and Salmon was super thin, and as dry as it can get. Shrimp tacos now come with no sauce. They have a extremely hard time trying to comprehend. Call the store when i get home & Manager Rudy get upset. He thinks if it is wrong. tough and hangs up on me. If you like you food done right the 1st or 2nd time don't go there. I think they must have a 1/2 hour training course to work there.. Terrible management. Forget them. Getting Corporate call. They have got to go!"}
{"text":"California bowels are delicious ask for more greens and they will give it to you. Salsa bar was clean and the service was good."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I never tried a fish taco. I ended up buying the Cabo Platter, a fish taco and a shrimp burrito. The Fish Taco's breading was way overcooked to the point of burned - I couldn't taste or feel the texture of the fish my first two bites. The Shrimp Burrito was delicious.  While I would go back again I'd probably avoid another fish taco as a result of this. Overall, it was a good eating experience and I would return."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and an original fish taco.  Thumbs up to the taco, but the soup is another story.  The picture of it on their advertising board looks very full of the ingredients, but the actual bowl of soup was thin, watery, flavorless and had only a smidgen of the ingredients pictured.  They even left out the avocados, as shown in the picture, and I had to go ask for them.  The waiting staff seemed preoccupied and couldn't care less about the food they were serving.  As a hobbyist gourmet chef myself, I make far, far, far, far better chicken tortilla soup than what I had at Rubios.  Ordinarily, the food and service are good here, but not this time!  I left hungry."}
{"text":"The wild blackened salmon burrito was pretty tasty, and fresh. No complaints at all from the 4 of us who stopped. After traveling to and from San Diego the thing that stood out was how clean this place was. The restrooms were spotless. The employees were very courteous and welcomed you as you walked in, and thanked you as you walked out. We actually spoke to one girl about directions and she was so helpful. I wish we had got her name to give her an extra \"thank you.\" I recommend this place."}
{"text":"For Mexican fast food this location is very good. Would have given 5 stars but during lunch hour service tends to be quite slow."}
{"text":"I always look forward to going to Rubio's! The food is always great, the employees are always very friendly, and the restaurant is always extremely clean! It's just a great, great place to go!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for a while, but it's felt like such a chore! 

This location is great. Clean everything, friendly staff, never crowded. The wait for food is never more than 5-10 minutes.

Now, the food. These are arguably some of the best fish tacos to be had. I really like that they've expanded their side offerings (pick 2: black or pinto beans, chips, rice). Not a fan of the rice, but the beans are always tasty. The salsas are all delish. I get a burrito every once in a while, which have all been great. 

I just wish there was more food. The two taco plate just doesn't fill me up! A third taco would fix that problem, but adding more items to your order makes it go up in price exponentially. If I'm already paying $7 for my combo, I'm disinclined to buy another taco/burrito/some other food item for $3+

Great food, great service, portions leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Quick service after ordering! And the food is decent too. Good for a quick meal when hungry. Yup I'm good!"}
{"text":"For good old 'baja style' fish tacos, Rubio's is a pretty good place.
They might have other stuff that's good, but...I just go with the traditional fish tacos.
Good.  Quick.  Reasonably priced.  Not the same-old same-old fast food.
Give it a go!"}
{"text":"I happen to be working in the area. I haven't been to any Rubio's in about a year. I like the new healthier menu options and the new look. I had the Mahi Mahi California Bowl. I had great service here. The salsa bar was fresh and clean. The employees seem to care and they keep the place clean. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"The menu's a bit more pricier than the typical but the food is good. Star deducted because there are a lot of locations on the west side of Vegas so I only stop by if I'm visiting family on that side of town."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tuesdays! I do not eat fast food, however, their fish tacos are very good. A huge plus is the employees: congenial with a smile on their face, and easy to converse with. Rubios, you put out a great restaurant and wonderful employees."}
{"text":"Really have nothing but good things to say about this Rubio's or any for that matter. Their burritos are probably my favorite in the \"fast casual\" scene, especially the \"Burrito especial\" (with chicken) for me. They changed the recipe a year or so ago so I ask for it to be done the with the old recipe and with avocado instead of guacamole. Service is quick, quality is good (I've never gotten sick after eating anything there). They have a huge menu for those who are picky eaters and a large self serve salsa bar. I wish the salsa was a bit chunkier but I really can't complain otherwise. Only wish there were more Rubio's locations to be honest."}
{"text":"Flat 3 Stars. Food was ok. Staff was ok. Cleanliness wasn't. Dirty floors, tables, and bathrooms. I'll pass on this location in the future."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and location is very clean. The staff is very friendly especially the manager, he is a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Rubio's gives me hope for fast food. 

Maybe it's the grass roof seating area inside (see photo), but the food is very good and it's not so cookie cutter predictable here. 

We first started coming here after leaving the northwest.  Mostly because it reminded me of another great seafood place: \"Taco Del Mar\".  I much prefer seafood, while the family enjoys beef and chicken.  The prices here are closer to Chipotle, than Toxic Hell (aka, Taco Bell).

I love their original Fish Taco and it's only $1.49 on Tuesdays after 2:30.  Normally it goes for $2.79, so it's a great deal.  Another favorite is their Veggie Burrito, which is more flavorful than Chipotle and priced at the same $6.49.  But here it's a better deal because they includes chips.  Their large side of beans is also a good deal for only $1.49.  They also have a good selection of beer.

Rubio's is not perfect and sometimes the fish can be dry.  But most of the time, it's really very good.  The folks who work here are also great.  Mark behind the counter particularly makes you feel welcome and is good at sharing stories.  Oscar the Manager keeps the place very clean and the Salsa Bar is always immaculate (see photo).  Another plus!

Here are their posted \"Fresh Rule\" as you come in:
1) Flavor comes FIRST; 
2) We never start your meal without YOU; 
3) Our chips, salsa and Guacamole are made FRESH; 
4) Our signature black & pinto beans are NEVER refried; 
5) We use NO lard or MSQ ever!

Works for me!

The only weakness, which is really not their fault, is the location. Rubio's is sandwich between an AT&T store and the Skeptical Chymist pub.  It has virtually no parking and because of those other two places the parking lot can be a mess at times.  I find 2:30-3:00 works best for a late lunch.

Three and Half Stars Plus, or \"A-OK\" bordering on Four.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Back for a fish taco snack. Always good and made to order. Tuesday is  $1.75 tacos, can't beat that deal. Fresh salsa bar too."}
{"text":"It's a better option in this mall than Sbarro but it could be better.  Semi-tasteless entree.  Was it worth the $10.39 price for a shrimp burrito??  Answer - hell no.  I didn't check in until afterwards so I missed out on this $2 off coupon which is what the regular price should be then mi us $2 more dollars.  The burrito was a tad soggy, beans tasted a tad like they were \"no salt added\" rejects from the factory.  The cashier was friendly.  They call u by your name instead of the numbers on the receipt.   They went from Louie to Lya.  Stick to receipt # unless your English improves. They also serve u thin, salt free chips which were decent.  I like the green sauce on salsa bar with cilantro/onion mix mixed together.  Will I be back???? Hmmm no."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, she got the bean and cheese burrito on a whole grain tortilla. It was a nice large portion and tasty. They accompanied it with a side of fresh tortilla chips and they have a salsa bar with a selection of 4 types of salsa which are all delicious too.

Quick service and great prices!"}
{"text":"Went here for a good meal and was not disappointed! Everything in the menu sounded good but I decided to get a salad and it was such a good portion I ate off of it twice! It had great grilled vegetables which added some great dimension of flavor to what could've been a bland salad and with the different mixed greens and the savory dressing it was perfect! Also came with a good portion of chicken and huge pieces! All in all I would definitely get this again and was pleased that I felt so satisfied from a salad!"}
{"text":"My first time in here and will not return.

Started with guy taking our order cut me off to get free red bulls from the red bulls sales gals.  I mean, who is the customer here?

I ordered a salad and he had no idea if there was Romaine lettuce in it and my kids cheese quesadilla came out with no cheese in it.  There are two ingredients in that order...cheese and a tortilla...

needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"For fast food, their fish tacos and shrimp tacos combos are tasty. It comes with beans and chips. I love all their salsas too. Rubio's is my favorite Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"Through my own personal forgetfulness, I forgot to ask for none of the chipotle sauce on my tacos. I was able to deconstruct my delicious tacos to remove most of the sauce (I find it an overpowering flavor for seafood, but that's a personal thing). Otherwise, my Argentine red shrimp was delicious. Service was quickly, fellow patrons were friendly AND my meal was free with purchase of a drink because it was my birthday. Yay!"}
{"text":"Best Rubios around. Never disappointed when I eat here. Very friendly service too. Their Ancho Citrus Grilled Shrimp burrito cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Accommodated my special diet request. Grilled chicken breast on a bed of cabbage topped with avocado. Thanks Rubios"}
{"text":"They have really good food but the service sucks. They are all 16 year old kids who would rather flirt than make my burrito right. They where flirting and touching each other at the front counter right in front of me. While the 50 year old manager who failed at life didn't care. It almost seemed like a start of a bad porno. At least the Mexican American whose messed up my burrito was trying and failing. I am important I am a yelper and they will pay."}
{"text":"I walked in and, after hearing the list of ingredients in the veggie burrito, asked them to make me a vegan rice, bean, veggie, and guacamole burrito.  The cashier named \"Nash\" made sure I got the correct rice, so it was vegan and repeated my order just to make sure it was right  When my burrito arrived, it was pretty low on rice, so the employee who delivered it, \"B.J.\", quickly got me a free side of rice to correct the problem.

The burrito tasted great, and I love the free salsa bar.  Both Nash and B.J. were friendly and happy to help me, and I'll be going back the next time I'm craving rice and beans.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"excellent fish taco especial! every detail counts! from the cabbage and dressing! to the yellow corn tortilla! the batter! etc. I have been to Baja California Mexico! I've had tacos by the sea! This place is a little slice of the baja experience! The extensive and various menu items are mouthwatering! Personally the battered fish taco is a winner!"}
{"text":"I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. 

The menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!"}
{"text":"My family are HUGE Rubio's fans and this location is top notch! The food is served fresh and hot to your table quickly and with a smile. The counter staff is helpful and courteous. And it's lobster taco time so you can't go wrong with a visit to Rubio's! Y-U-M"}
{"text":"Good. A friend told me about Rubio's and I had to try it. Asked a few questions about the menu and the manager was very helpful. The fish taco is very very good and I more than like the grilled shrimp burrito. Rubio's will definitely because one of my new regular spots. It would be nice if they had a location \"inside\" of the 101."}
{"text":"I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER"}
{"text":"Alexia the manager as she called herself was extremely aggressive and rude. She told me and my daughter I didn't know how to order. Then handed me off to James the shift leader.  Alexia needs to quit or move to another position in the back where there's no customer service."}
{"text":"Avoid this location. They tend to close around 6pm as it seems when they meet their quota on the number of fish tacos they can sell on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Clean, laidback environment, always friendly staff and delicious meals. Mom and I visit often and are always treated to a pleasantly casual experience. The only thing I'd give 1 star to would be the music that's always playing. Pushing that aside, the food's responsibly grown and raised, so for us food-conscious people that's a huge plus. The bowls offer a lot of bang for their buck-they're filling, and I have a very big appetite.

Mom and I will continue being repeat customers."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for lunch because they never disappoint. The wait staff is extremely nice. They are not over the top like you might find at In-N-Out, but VERY personable. 

The food is always prepared fresh and delicious. You cannot go wrong with the original fish tacos. My personal favorite, however, are the grilled gourmet tacos. 

They are consistently in the lobby making sure it is clean and stocked up. In addition, they'll bring the food to your table between taking orders. Seems like it's an unwritten rule, rather than calling out your name or a number."}
{"text":"This Rubio's location is great! Service is friendly and fast, they always get my order right and the food is great! I have had multiple bad experiences at the Eastern and Serene location but this location has never disappointed. I recommend the Classic Steak Burrito Especial. It's not on the menu anymore but they will make it for you. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's but this location is terrible! The service is very slow even when they are not very busy. I've been there a few times and they have messed up my order every time. Once they made the completely wrong burrito. Another time I got chicken instead of steak. Tonight I ordered a Steak Burrito Especial to go, got home to eat it and there was not one piece of steak in the burrito. They also tried to give me a tiny one ounce container of guacamole with my order of chips and guacamole. I go to the location on Green Valley and Pebble all the time and they have always given me the 4 oz cup of guacamole with the chips and guacamole and they always get my order correct at that location. Avoid this location and go to the Green Valley and Pebble location instead."}
{"text":"The grilled ono burrito is now nearly $8.00. Thats like a 25 percent increase overnight! Want cheese? .95 cents more! I couldn't believe my eyes. As the guys rang me up, I realized that with tax, a lousy burrito from an average at best fast food mexican hut was going to be over $10.00!!  I looked at the clerked and said, \" are you out of your mind?\". He just shrugged, I mean, what the f&$@ does he care, anyway? Then I promptly said, \" uh, bu bye.\" People, their food is marginal on a good day, and now everything is way too expensive. Chipotle anyone?."}
{"text":"First off let me start my saying I love Rubio's. I live in south chandler where I find the best Rubio's so far in Arizona. However I go to this rubios often because it's close to where I work. However it's always a disappointment. A gentleman in a collard shirt is always working when I go in and he does his best to not wear gloves while he is on the line preparing food. He wrapped my burrito without gloves he used a pizza cutter to place cheese on top of the beans because he refuses to wear gloves or wash his hands. I really hope this is not the manager. The crew always seems wore out or like they just don't care. I hope this improves because I love Rubio's."}
{"text":"Omg there chopped salad with shrimp is so yummy. I love it with Xtra dressing and Xtra salsa fresca. So good"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Rubios I have been to. It is the cleanest. I have been to several locations, my husband loves their burritos, and this really is by far the best. 
I'm not sure why there are bad reviews. There must be new management, this place seems completely different from what I originally read. Those posts are from half a year ago though, there must be a  new manager.

I was hesitant to go after I read the older reviews, but the newer reviews gave me hope. 
The manager was really nice and the cashier was the sweetest. They brought me my food. They even made sure that my applesauce and chicken nuggets for my daughter we not touching so the nuggets stayed hot. Super thoughtful, the food was absolutely delicious. 

 Grilled shrimp burrito is a must try. If you are keeping an eye on your figure, try their citrus salad! I get it every time. And for kiddos? Lets just say it is my go-to when my little one decides to be a picky eater."}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried on the menu here. The fish selections are always fresh tasting. They have great Customer service, as well. Great value."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, and service.  Wish I could go more often.   Michael and team are always ready to serve."}
{"text":"When this first Rubio's in Henderson opened the first thing I sputtered was something like, \"FISH tacos?  Gag me, like, with a spoon!\"  Ok, so it wasn't the long ago, but that's the sentiment basically.  I could think of nothing more disgusting.

Then one day, at another taco place, I tried a fish taco and I loved it it death.  So then, I decided to try Rubio's.  Oh MAN!  This place is awesome!  Their Fish Taco Especial is heaven in a tortilla.  Their chips and salsa are good for a quick serve place and it's pretty reasonably priced.

If you're still one of those holding out from fear from the fish taco, just come here and try one.  They're awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great quick stop for lunch. The staff has always been friendly and I LOVE their grilled fish burrito. The food is always very fresh, made to order. I wish they had more locations because I would go much more frequently. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get (large portions)."}
{"text":"This Rubio's is far better than any of the mexican food I've tried here in Henderson.  Awesome service and food quality.  Probably better than other Rubio's I've tried across California."}
{"text":"Door not locked, it 9:26 but they are closed?!? It is a Friday night really? (Post my review, I don't need to post more. This is not ok)"}
{"text":"Three words keep me coming back to Rubio's...fish taco Tuesday. The original fish taco is only $1.50 after 2:30 p.m. every Tuesday. It's a beer battered Pollock on a corn tortilla with white sauce, a small amount of salsa, cabbage, and a slice of lime. At that price, it's a great value and I enjoy the picante sauce offered on the salsa bar. 

The sides are vegetarian. Unlike most fast food chains, they don't use lard or any other additives I find unsavory. Most of their seafood is 100% sustainably sourced and that matters to me. Also, the carryout packaging is compostable or recyclable, also important. Rubio's seems to be committed to being eco-friendly and I can support that. 3 stars for the tacos but company practices earn that extra star."}
{"text":"I just placed a to go order.  The people here are very friendly! The food is delicious.  My steak tacos didn't come with salsa and I wish I would have known that :(  but my fault for not asking.  It's delicious even without it!! Great food, great service, great lunch!!"}
{"text":"Place is always dirty, tables never cleaned. The staff costumer service is below average and they are always doing nothing when the should be making the place look presentable! I don't recommend this place to any one with good hygiene expectations"}
{"text":"About as good as it gets for fast food. I'm usually terrified of eating seafood from fast food joints, but I make an exception for Rubio's. The fish tacos are surprisingly good.... fish tastes fresh and is supposedly raised in a sustainable way. They have quite a few varieties and are constantly rotating new concepts onto the menu. Burritos and nachos are also very solid options. Rubio's is only a short walk away from the Aria so if you need some late night grub and don't feel like sitting at Cafe Vettro, Rubio's is a great option"}
{"text":"Kinda pricy for what your getting- portion price quality. Tons of other restaurants will give you better foods and deals."}
{"text":"the place is very nice, it has delicious food and great service. The place is clean, get a friendly greeting all the time."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say, but there are some chains that I love, and Rubios is one of them.  I love their original fish tacos.  I don't care for anything else on the menu.

And anyone who hates on eating in chain restaurants... I DARE you to come to Rubios.  Original taco plate, and substitute the beans for rice.  Yea, ... I said it!  I'm done here, you need to know nothing else."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this Rubio's. The food is always good and they have never gotten any of my \"special requests\" wrong which is impressive."}
{"text":"First time at visiting a Rubio's restaurant. 
I was really craving some Mexican food and this was the closest place. I ordered a burrito and a churro, my lady ordered the balsamic salad.

The first hint should have been that the staff did not know how to pronounce anything in Spanish correctly. A second hint should have been that I was the only Spanish speaker in the restaurant.

Overall the service was slow and poor, even taking into account the dinner rush. The quality was lacking. The salsas were fresh (the only plus) but even the hot salsa was not actually hot.

Overall, poor service, bland tasting food, and even blander salsas. Next time I crave Mexican, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a Rubios. Not much I can say about the food. But the employees are fantastic, they keep me coming back from time to time and are so personable and friendly. Management is doing a lot right at this location"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I tried to be super smart and healthy and ordered the Chipotle Ranch salad, but it was probably more of a calorie bomb than the tacos.  Anyway, it was pretty tasty and of a decent size.  I'm not sure I like a mound of guacamole and full size tortilla chips (not strips) in my salad, but it was good nonetheless.  I would like to return to try their tacos.

Their chips were good and fresh but their 4 or so salsas were just ok.  None really stood out to me in terms of flavor or heat.

The only thing that really stood out about this place was the service.  The staff here really went out of their way to be super nice and friendly which is rare for a fast food type place."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! Friendly staff and great management that set the tone for this particular rubios restaurant. Food always made fresh and comes out hot."}
{"text":"We went here 10 years ago in San Diego when they had lobster tacos. Lobster no more. On our first trip in Phoenix, it took us 20+ minutes to get our food. With 3 pre-teens in tow, it was brutal waiting. A lady sitting next to us happened to be a shift manager and gave us a hand written coupon for 2 free entrees. 

We went back the next day and the coupon was honored. It took them maybe 5 minutes to bring the food out. They even took care of some of my finicky kids. They redeemed themselves."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's.. I am definitely in here a few times a month. Their fish tacos are some of my favorite I have ever had! I also really love their california bowl with chicken and the green sauce (although red is good too).. My ex always raved about the burritos.. Pretty much everything here is great. All fresh ingredients and you really can taste the difference. There is always the same cashier when I go in.. I cannot remember his name but he is very friendly and always keeps up even when it gets busy."}
{"text":"I got the Blackened One Burrito® and was pleasantly surprised. I would give them 5 stars but I waited 11 minutes for my food. (Yes I time people) I could tell they sent all their cooks home but one, I'm thinking because its Sunday during a football game isn't the busiest. Restaurant felt and looked very clean and people were friendly even with my inpatients. I will go back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I go almost every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 original tacos). Every experience has been positive, the staff are friendly, polite and accommodating. I usually sit outside and when the server brought out my food, he noticed that the sun was in my face so he adjusted the umbrella for me. 
If you sign up for their emails you will receive a free birthday meal and it's not an a-la-carte size meal either. Great value and amazing taste for a fast food place. 

My only complaint for this location is the front door handles, they are filthy and black. I hate touching public door handles anyway, so I usually bring a napkin with me to use to open the door."}
{"text":"I have been waiting on a to go order for about 45 minutes.,... Still waiting..

This is not my first experience at this rubios. Last time I was here and found a hair in my food so I stopped eating it. Later that night I found myself throwing up over the toilet for about 6 hours

NEVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"Idk how this place doesn't have a higher rating than three stars. It isn't the best food I've ever had but I must say I find it to be satisfying and quite delicious. Since being exposed to this restaurant by a coworker I have eaten here like five times in the last month. It's fairly wholesome if you get the grilled options and it fills me for under ten bucks. 

The service is personable and the store is always in great shape. If you haven't already, you should try Rubio's!"}
{"text":"There food is excellent for a fast food taco place. It's pretty pricey for 3-4 small shrimp on a taco (2 people $30+), but sometimes you just pay more for what you like."}
{"text":"Love love love rubios and taco Tuesday's! I always come here for the tacos on Tuesdays. The guy Ryan at the cashier was great and def one of the harder working employees. When I walked in there the floor was covered in sticky goo and my feet kept sticking to the ground. Also there was tons of lettuce and onion and cilantro on the floor. 
Ryan was the only one to start sweeping the floor and tidying up the place. 
The other employee was like \"aww Ryan, where were u the other night when we needed the floors sweeper?\" This just tells me the employees don't take pride in their work here.
Regardless of that mishap, the food here is amazing and always crunchy goodness."}
{"text":"I don't usually like \"tex mex\" or \"Cali-mex\" food, as I usually enjoy authentic Mexican food. However Rubios is my only exception! 
I have now been to this location in summerlin 3-4 times now since I have moved here 6 weeks ago. The location is clean, fun and they play 80s rock which is good for the whole family. I always see a bunch of families here especially on Tuesdays after 2:30 when they have their original fish taco (cabbage, lime, white sauce and mild salsa) for 1.50 (originally 2.99) and their fish taco especial: guacamole , cheese, cilantro/onion, usually 3.29 is only 2.00!!!! Such a steal. I usually get 6 tacos for my husband and I for only 10$!!!!!!! They are quite large too! I can only eat 2 tacos along with my husband. And we take some for work the next day. 
The fish is Alaskan poluck and is very crispy and tasty. No signs of fishy smell or taste. 
If it was only closer to where I live I swear id eat here every day. 
They best is that they close at 9pm on Tuesdays so when ur feeling lazy/tired after a long day of work or the gym, the fish isn't greasy and taste really refreshing esp with a squirt of their fresh lime and tomatillo sauce (which I hoard) lol 
Other options at the salsa bar include fresh lemon/lime, the mild and tomatillo sauce for people like me who don't like spicy. But for the spicy lovers their chipotle is smokey and lightly spicy and their picante is real spicy as well.
Come try it and come on Tuesdays usually after 7pm to skip the usual rush of dinner. I one time made the mistake of coming here around 7pm. Big mistake. Long lines and at least a 20-30min wait for my tacos. Now I know not to come til after 7pm"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Rubios?  Always good quality food and great customer service. They are always having specials. My favorite is when they do the lobster. If you get the surf and turf burrito you won't be disappointed!

If they have the wild Argentinian red shrimp bowl, get it!!  When I say it's so full of flavor and looks ahhhhmazing!  I've added a picture for your viewing pleasure. Long live Rubios!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware! I ordered the veggie taco to go, which I have done before. When I got home and started eating, it was loaded with bacon!! I'm infuriated. I doubled checked the website to see if it was supposed to be included and I made the mistake, but the mistake was theirs. In addition, the rices that came with our kids dinners were burnt. This location has gone down hill. This is not the first order they have messed up. We will no longer go here."}
{"text":"Will not return food was good other than the supper nochos we got for an appetizer and got the same time as my dinner. The waitress was rude this is why I will not return. I work in customer service and I got really bad customer service tonight."}
{"text":"This place isn't really worth it. I got a steak burrito especial. They were really stingy with the guacamole/chipotle sauce and it was all on one end of the burrito. Food wasn't very flavorful. Everyone at my table had issues with their tortilla cracking and falling apart to the point that they just ate with a fork. Steak was juicy and good, however. I feel like for $14 (with the drink) I should have gotten a decent helping of guac and seasoned food. Better off going to chipotle tbh."}
{"text":"I was given a free meal at this location and went ahead and redeemed it.  The food was good and the service excellent.  An improvement over the last time I was here.  My only recommendation is for them to not cook the fish until it is hard and crispy.  Just lightly fry it.  Good job."}
{"text":"Very good catering...something for everyone! I only gave 4 stars because the need to have a delivery option for catering. Overall everyone loved it."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and good.  I was very please that the store honored my belated bday meal coupon too.  However the food that was on my plate did not look that appetizing when it arrived.  The tacos looked nothing like the display picture and the chips were all crushed.
I know that Rubio's can do better than this."}
{"text":"The price of their tacos went up a little. Their burritos are smaller than what I expect and you can get a bigger and tastier one from Robertos. This isn't really even Mexican food. It's fake in my opinion. I also understand that it's summer, but please make sure there's no dead cockroaches on the side of the table. Too over priced for what it's worth and not that great."}
{"text":"Just got home with Nachos & Chicken. 2nd bite and I found a very long black hair! Called them and spoke with the manager on duty who offered to remake them. We live 30 minutes away & I'm no longer in a. Nacho mood to say the least. No offer of a refund. Won't be going back there! Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Because of all the negativity and people complaining about not getting their way I always try to make it a point that if I have a pleasant experience to yelp it. We go to this Rubio's quite often and I have to give them credit where credits due. 

The manager is the nicest gentlemen I've spoke to all day and made sure he attended to everyone and everything. Food is always great. People are always in a good mood. 

Thank you for changing the mood of my entire day."}
{"text":"By far the best Rubio's we've been to. The food is perfection here at the Riverview location. 
I've been to other locations and the burritos never come close. Usually, you get too much filler in the form of rice and beans with sparse protein. If I wanted that, I'd go to Chipotle! 
Riverview Rubio's definitely packs the meat into their fare.
 My favorites are the shrimp or chicken burritos and the salmon or ahi tacos. Enchiladas are okay too.

Service is always the deciding factor for me though and the staff and manager John are definitely ahead of the pack!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.

On a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book."}
{"text":"The healthmex chicken burrito is a good option for tasty mexican without all of the calories. The staff is always really nice and its a quick somewhat healthy meal."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the guy working the register was unnecessarily rude and condescending. I ordered the grilled fish taco plate and that really seemed to confuse him. Customer service seems to get worse and worse."}
{"text":"I love the food! Service is pretty friendly. We eat here often because I am health conscious and there are plenty of choices. My only disappointment is I rarely get full for the price of the food, there should be more in the plate."}
{"text":"For Mexican fast food, it's really good. I generally only have the opportunity to take out the food but it has always been good. The have a range of fresh salsas available that suite most tastes. I generally prefer really hot stuff, but there is enough warmth and flavor in their offerings to be ok for me. I am not a big seafood eater, but my wife really likes their fish tacos. I wish I could dine in more often."}
{"text":"Although I am not always in the mood for Rubio's fish tacos when my wife wants them, I always realize she was right on the first bite."}
{"text":"Although I like the food the service is generally very slow.   Calling ahead is of little value -- either the phone is busy or you sit on hold.  Again, I like Rubios, food.  I just wish they could get their service into a timeframe that made sense."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday.  Well prepared food.  Nice service.  Went back later to purchase some catering size portions...manager was super nice when I wasn't very nice.  I was mistaken but yet she accommodated me.  Gave me large sized rice when I didn't deserve it.  Kudos to the crew and store.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Working close by was a benefit, but now that I've moved I still find time to stop by and have some tacos. Staff is friendly and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"The salad always tastes so fresh even though it's \"fast food\". It's also incredibly filling considering it's pretty low in calories."}
{"text":"Alright, this place is my go to place for simple fish tacos. They have a hilarious young staff of what appears to be high school kids enjoying their first job. They do their job in style and look like they are happy to serve you. The place is always clean and is constantly being swept and mopped as customers come and go. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the salsa bar. They have a salsa verde that I can't get enough of. I always get extra chips to keep snacking. Sometimes I'll get chunky mild salsa to switch it up, but the verde is where it's at.

The fountain machine serves a unique option, vanilla coke, and no this is not one of those all in one coke machines.My main complaint about this chain is that that some of the best items in the menu get taken away... If you have been here before, you might remember a mango habanero version of their tacos and burritos. This is no longer an option.

Don't have me fall in love with an item and just take it away. I know this must have been a corporate decision, but still!!!

Regardless I will be back for $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays. Never forget Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Good service,  mediocre food. Classic tacos were small, she'll isn't crispy,  ingredients were OK. Basically Taco Bell food plus 3 bucks."}
{"text":"Since the first time I've eaten here, Jackson the cashier has remembered my name. I've only been here 3 times about 2 weeks apart. I'm impressed! It's nice to walk into a restaurant with a friendly \"Hello Taryn!\" even when I'm not a regular. Excellent customer service. Makes me feel like more than the number on my receipt"}
{"text":"Awesome! You gotta try this location ...friendly clean and as always delicious and fresh food at Rubios!"}
{"text":"Rubio's has always been a safe option for us. We enjoy Mexican with a seafood twist to it. I've been to this location of Rubio's a few times now and have had a great experience each time. The food is delicious - they have never messed up our order. The place is clean and the staff are great. We came last time a little later in the evening, and there was not much of a crowd at the time. Our food was delivered very quickly. The staff could have been a little happier. We will be back, and would recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"It's a clean, well lit place with friendly staff. They have a great menu and I esp. like the salsa bar. The restroom was clean and well stocked as well. I don't know why but nothing makes them special you know? It's better than fast food, they have a great, clean dining area. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"I really want to love Rubios, I've been there three times, and it's on the way home from work. The problem is that both times I've gone on Mon. Night between 7:30-8 and I've ordered the Surf and Turf Taco plate. The lobster taco is o.k. The turf taco has been like eating shoe leather on both occasions. It's just disgusting, and I won't be trying it again. The portions in the large box are small for the $9+ you pay. Both times there were just a few chips in the box, like the chips were too expensive to give you a nice handful. They open the box to show you your meal before you leave, & I'm not sure why. There's just nothing to be impressed about while looking down at a box that is half full. No cheese topping on beans which are pre-packaged in little soufflé cups. Tues. they have a promotion for $1.50 fish tacos. They are just o.k. too. No special fish taco sauce on the fish tacos like some places use. I know a few other taco places that I would much rather spend my $9 at and get the quality I believe I'm paying for. Feeling a little disappointed now."}
{"text":"We were driving around sight seeing, shopping all that good stuff you do winter in Surprise,AZ.  So we see this place called Rubios.  It does not say what type of food etc.  we go in not even knowing what to order look at the prices and menu.  There is a restaurant next door too, so we go and check it out. Some type of oriental place where you choose two or three scoops and all the added ingredients with your price of two or three scoops, prices vary on what type of fish. We decided to go back to Rubios.  
My wife had Chipotle orange salad with grilled chicken. My daughter Had the Chopped salad with grilled chicken. Myself love fish tacos. All were great but the winner and best tasting Chipotle orange salad.  Hands down the chicken was seasoned like it marinated, not dried out. The selection of sauces we amazing from very spicy to mild.
The service was fantastic and the pricing reasonable. My order and daughter were on that day the special of the day. The specials every day are different. What is done usually it's cost a dollar less and a soft drink include.
Will return to any Rubios."}
{"text":"My favorite casual meal in the Valley.  The fish is always tasty, the salsa bar is amazing, and the staff is always friendly.  Will continue to come here often!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is a good lunch spot close to our office. I've been there a few times with my colleagues at work earlier this year. We have not been there recently so today, we decided to go today for lunch. Some of the menu options I tired so far are the salsa verde shrimp taco, their fish taco especial, & the Ancho citrus shrimp burrito. They were all pretty good. You order at the register and the food is delivered to your table. Today I ordered the salsa verde shrimp taco. It was good but probably not my favorite. I've enjoyed their fish taco better. 

They are mostly good on getting the food out pretty quickly however sometimes they get quite busy during lunch time so be prepared to wait, occasionally. 

They have a pretty good salsa bar. I like their salsa Verde. With the plates/meals, you get chips and pinto beans. The chips are usually crispy and fresh and go very well with the salsas at the salsa bar. 

Prices are average and service is good."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent and good at any of the restaurants. This location also has another consistency that is to be noted. That is the gracious and attentive service. The team that works here has mastered the art of being in tune with the customer! True, it is fast food with the team here makes it not seem so transactional Nicely done leadership!"}
{"text":"Really good food and very nice staff. Temperature of food is generally inconsistent. Wish they'd improve their timing or use warmers or something.    Tacos and beans are often only slightly warmer than room temp. When the foot is served hot, it's really great. Overall this is a great place for lunch. Good size portions and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff are super nice and accommodating. Love this place! Wish they stayed on top of wiping down tables, otherwise it's perfect.  And like I said, the food is excellent and they aim to please so have it your way.  Nice friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been years since I have eaten at rubios and I was pleased with my return. Service was great. $1.50 tacos on Tuesday and omg the tacos git better!!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is so yummy, I've gotten their shrimp tacos on more than one occasion and they're always delicious! Staff is friendly and service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here based on yelp reviews. The server was great very helpful with menu choices. Had fish taco trio it was delicious and filling. Also tried the chicken salad and chicken quesadilla. They were all delicious. Clean and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I mean come on: Rubio's, Fish Tacos, Casino and drinks.  What more do you want??  

Even for a \"food court\" Rubio's the service is always great and the food is outstanding.  If anyone ever thinks it takes to long, please remember they are making it to order back there.

I have always loved Rubio's but this location is great because there is so much more to do and see."}
{"text":"We have always had good luck here. You can be pretty healthy and it's fresh. They have a nice variety of choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Personally,  I  don't  trust   5  star  reviews,  that's   why  I  am  only  giving 4  Stars...   we   have  dinner   at  this  restaurant  almost  every  week  and  prefer  to  come on  Tuesdays  because  of  their  Taco  specials.

We  have  never  been  disappointed,  the  food  is  always  fresh  and  tasteful.  One  of  the  few  fast  food  restaurants  where  you  can  have  a  beer   with  your  food  and  the  prices  are  moderate.   

We  love  the  decoration  which  makes  you  feel  like  at  the  beach  (with  a  little  bit  of  phantasy...)   Some  of  the  employees  are  super  friendly,   others  should  work  a  little  bit  on their  customer  service  skills.   I  talked  to  the  manager  about  this   a  while  ago.

We  will  definitely  continue  to  come."}
{"text":"I come here for one reason only! $1.50 fish taco Tuesday's! Of course there are other things on the menu, but the fish tacos are delicious!! The fish is fried perfectly crispy and is served with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. And at $1.50 each, you can easily wolf down 5 or 6 depending on your appetite. The kitchen is open, so you can watch them prepare your food. The employees have always been nice. And the salsa bar is awesome!! Mild, medium, hot...they have it all. Don't forget to load up on the cilantro/onion garnish too. Two thumbs up for me!"}
{"text":"Kind, professional family oriented. 
Thanks Jackie, Cathy, (We miss Lorena, too)"}
{"text":"*****REVIEW FOLLOW UP*****
After speaking at length with Jorge on Monday and Yvonne 
on Tuesday, (who actually called Monday) I am more than confident that the management team addressed my concerns swiftly and compassionately. 
Although, the thought of this incident still moved me to tearsas I rehearsed it,  I am confident that my experience didn't holistically represent that of the management team that took necessary time to understand what happened. 
The team, saistfied with the consistency of both accounts, offered my additional training for their entire staff & also covered my family dinner at my preferred location.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Ya know, just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation, Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my (frequent) inexpensive taco/burrito cravings.

Chipotle obviously has the burrito game on lock. I just won't order one anywhere else, it won't measure up.  El Pollo Loco's grilled chicken is phenomenal, as are their salsas, and Sonora Mesquite Grill has the most amazing Carne Asada I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth, so I'm covered there also. Now, you may be thinking to yourself \"This girl really has it figured it. What void in her life could Rubio's possible fill that she has to add it to an already stellar line up of very well thought out and eloquently presented Mexican casual dining options?\"  To that I say: Fish Tacos.

I'm not saying that Rubio's has the best Fish Tacos in the world. I may be an expert on a lot of things, but sadly Fish Tacos isn't one of them. But Rubios' are good, and their tomatillo salsa is tasty and, as previously mentioned, they carry Coke Zero which is just so ridiculously head and shoulders above Diet Coke I'm surprised its market hasn't been completely cannibalized by now. I guess some people just enjoy barely-carbonated cola beverages that have the aftertaste of battery acid. But I digress.

I'm going to let you guys in on a little secret: Chicken Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad.  Grilled chicken (not El Pollo Loco quality, but it's fair), avocado, and roasted veggies over lettuce with a tangy balsamic dressing. A good portion as long as you're not famished, and really quite tasty. Here's the secret: 310 Calories. For the whole thing, none of that \"without dressing, avocado, chicken, or anything that tastes good\" bull (I'm looking at you Subway).  I like to dip the chicken in tomatillo salsa, which might add like 5 calories to the deal, but I'm okay with it because I'm still saving about 400 calories which can now be put towards a more noble purpose: Booze! So, Rubio's, take a seat in the line up. If for the sake of the booze and the booze alone, you've earned it."}
{"text":"Rubio's has the best fresh Mexican tacos and burritos in Scottsdale.  I had the shrimp and bacon burrito and it was amazing.  The staff was super friendly and the manager even took the time to show me my order before I left to make sure my order was correct.  Most places just hand you your order and show you the door only to find out when you get home your order is screwed up.  The restaurant was clean and the staff super friendly. Forget about Chipotle, forget about Cafe Rio.  This place is much much better!!!  It is tucked away in the corner of the plaza so keep an eye out so you don't miss it!"}
{"text":"$1.50 fish tacos on Tuesday that taste like good quality fish.  A couple cold Coronas and it don't get much better for the price.  I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Beer battered fish tacos for the win! These are amazing but sometimes overly fried, though the fish itself is always tender and moist. Add some salsa for more flavor. it is a bit on the expensive side for simple fried fish tacos. I would also consider trying the burritos that can be fish burritos, shrimp burritos, or LOBSTER BURRITOS which are all amazing. 

Regardless of what you get, 2 tacos, or burrito that comes w/ chips, I guarantee you will be full!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Rubio's since it opened 20 years ago. I recently was in the area with my wife and we had our well behaved pup with us. We had a tradition the past few years of bringing our dog with us late at night and eating on the patio.  When we got to the patio it smelled worse than a dumpster. It smelled like the trash had not been taken out in a week.

Inside was even worse as visible through the glass was trash on 3 or 4 tables with no one bothering to pick it up. They seemed severely understaffed as I saw only 1 employee who did not come out for a few minutes while my wife and I debated if we wanted to eat there tonight.

When I went in to order I looked at the salsa bar and they were all almost empty. What salsa was there looked old as if it had been there since they opened.  There was also salsa all over the counters. It was at that point that I walked out and we went elsewhere for Mexican food.

I could not be more disappointed. In the past week I also had been to the Mesa location which was in pristine condition as well as the one in the Chandler Mall.

I will not be coming back to this location until they get it together. If they don't they will face the same fate as most of the other locations to the left of them have over the years and go out of business  as they will lose customers due to the disgusting conditions of the establishment.."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch.  I got the 2 classic taco plate.  I substituted rice for the beans with no problem.  The Manager was great.  I like have they have Stevia and 2 different unsweetened tea options.   I like the food being delivered to you by name and on real plates.  I thinks it's great that their to-go food is served in paper boxes instead of styrofoam.  The salsas bar had good choices and the chips were tasty."}
{"text":"Viridiana is very efficient when ordering & when checking ur food. Also, she is very friendly. I appreciate the quickness & deliciousness of the fresh fish. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff - friendly and explains items on menu.  Service was good.  Food was prepared when ordered, fresh, and delivered to table.  You get own drinks and condiments from small bar.  The entire place was clean and staff was busy maintaining cleaniness.  Will return soon to try  one of their vegetarian selections.  Their beans were bland.  But salsa variety was good."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's and probably have it at least once a week! Favorite dish used to be the blackened tilapia, which is now gone. My stable go-to meal is probably the blackened Pacific Mahi Mahi now, occasionally the Original Fish Taco. Don't forget the seasonal Langostino Lobster! That's a must-get when it's in town.

Anyway, long story short, this particular Rubio's never disappoints. Food is always excellent; the speed of service is quick, even during the lunch crunch. Great location!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is as good as it needs to be. 

Rubio's is a small-ish baja taco place that is marginally nicer than fast food but definitely not a full sized restaurant. That being said, it's quite nice and clean and the decor is very appropriate. Think Baja Fresh, not Chipotle. 

The fish tacos here, which are the main draw, are good but could be better. The overall mix of cabbage, sauce, fried fish, and corn tortilla is good, but I couldn't help but feel like the fish was a bit lacking. The fried crunch the fish had was excellent, but the underlying meat was a bit missing. The tacos also lacked heat, which I think is critical for a good fish taco. 

I would eat here again, but there are definitely better places on the west coast."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and food was fresh. Mango tea here is amazing!"}
{"text":"I always shy away from fish tacos ... my theory is ya gotta be near the water to have fresh seafood.  Well - Rubios has it figure out... OMG ... I LOVE THEIR FISH TACOS.  And Taco Tuesday - after 2:30pm - $1.75 for the original, and $2 bucks for the \"especial\" .. well - that's down right awesome prices.  Took a group of friends there last night.  Two had never had fish tacos before.  They're believers now.  And can I just say - the ultra spicy \"Jalapeño Citus\" sauce makes me cry tears of joy each time I burn my lips?  Ok - just said it.  

Yum!  Fast Food Done Right!"}
{"text":"I waited for 40 minutes after I ordered, never received my food.  Never received an apology or explanation.  Wll not return"}
{"text":"I have a bias AGAINST chains ... I prefer to support the independent guy ... I find they care more, I get more unique experiences and food, and I like sharing the wealth a bit.  That said.  Man... the taco's at this place are amazing.  Full of flavor, bold but not over the top.  I love the delicate crunch of the fish filets that are fried.  I had the coastal trio - three different seafood tacos.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  Wow.... that doesn't happen all the time.  Great job all!"}
{"text":"It's not bad if you don't mind your food being made by a girl chewing gum with her mouth open. I hope she brushes"}
{"text":"Always my go to for consistently good fish tacos. The salsa bar makes all the difference especially when you can customize your heat level and add more fixings. I always stick with the original. But I had the chicken tortilla soup from here and it did not disappoint. The avocados were really good!"}
{"text":"I like the salad I had. It was nice to have a pick me up while christmas shopping. Especially since it was real food. I appreciated that with McDonald's behind us and walking by greasy food, it tasted good too. The manager josue took our order. Great job!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and Rubio's always hits the spot! It's not your typical 'covered in cheese entrees\" that leave you feeling bloated and tired. All the ingredients are fresh and chips aren't drenched in oil. I'm a fan of their especial fish tacos and you can never go wrong with a chicken quesadilla. Prices are decent for the amount of food you receive and there's a serve yourself salsa bar with 5-6 options. This location is great for a quick meal before or after a movie next door or some shopping in the complex."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, the home of Rubio's we expect cleanliness and consistency of the food product. And this Rubio's delivered. Michael the manager open right at 10 am and promptly took our order. About 10 minutes later the food was delivered piping hot and fresh. The accessory table with all the salsa's was clean and well stocked. Fish tacos were great and consistent with what we get in San Diego. They have covered outside seating, but on a 100+ degree day, stay inside where it nice and cool and you can enjoy your meal. Staff was attentive, clean and well presented. Only downside, no Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Went back here for lunch after several years. Love the new menu. Clean, fresh, excellent flavor. Recommend the trio of fish and shrimp tacos   Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly. Food is Rubino's food.  Asked if beans were in with my meal.  Carlos said oh yeah!  Wrong Carlos!!! Tables were dirty.  Salsa bar ok.  Just should get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Simple, reliable, clean and fresh.  I love Rubios.  However, the cleanliness at this location is lacking."}
{"text":"Rubio's is always good but this location in particular has really friendly and professional staff. I like the options for seating and the downtown location."}
{"text":"This place has great food and the friendly staff is the best! Fish tacos were great."}
{"text":"I really looove the food here. I am a huge fan of seafood. The employees have always been nice to me- especially the manager. I particularly like getting the Mahimahi burrito- but when they have lobster available I'm all over it.

The only reason why I don't give it a full 5 stars is because the bathroom is always VERY dirty. Every. Single. Time. So I don't go to the bathroom there, I have to hold it.
If they bathroom were clean- at least sometimes, it'd get a 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy a fish taco from time to time and where else can you get one in landlocked AZ? Look no further. Mind you, I don't classify it as Mexican food, rather baja style. 

At this particular location, they have deals prominently on the whiteboard in the front, which I've enjoyed on several occasions. One time they featured a three taco plate for less than seven bucks. Not bad when you're dining out in this area. If you join their email club, you can get cool things like free chips and guacamole.

Definitely recommend stopping by here if you're looking for quick and cheap in the northern Scottsdale/Carefree area. And, looking for great fish tacos of course."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is outstanding, always fresh and made to order perfectly! All of the salsas in the salsa bar are amazing, and the restaurant itself is kept super clean and bright. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful, offering recommendations if you need help choosing, and making substitutions easily. I'd eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"First time in a Rubio's. It was very good. Had the California bowl.  My friend had fish tacos. Will order it with the sauce on the side next time. Kind of strong. But good. Place was clean and the employees were very nice and polite. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"the whole \"Fresh Mex\" fad is in full effect.  These franchise types are everywhere.  Long gone are the days of the battle:  Should I just get Taco Bell or Del Taco?  Now we have these Mexifast food joints.  I have always noticed this place while driving around.  I was on a lunch break one day and wanted to check it out.  

I entered the restaurant and was greeted promptly.   I had no idea what I wanted to get.  It seems like this place boast more about its seafood and not just chicken or steak stuff.  I asked the guy behind the counter, \"What should I get?\"  He was friendly and said I had to try the shrimp burrito.  He said I wouldn't be disappointed.  

The restaurant has the typical salsa bar.  All clearly labeled and lined up in their spicy level.  I usually always get a verde salsa.  The cool thing about this salsa bar is that they recommend what salsa tastes best with what you order.  So I got the salsa that goes well with shrimp.  

When I got my burrito is was a decent size.  I wasn't too worried about a big pile of food because it was lunch and I didn't want to be sleepy the rest of the day.  I took a bite and it was pretty good.  The mixture of shrimp, rice, and spices were great.  

Will I try this place again?  Yes  Will I get it for dinner?  probably not 

Either way it was a tasty burrito, so go ahead and give it a shot!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Ran in to get a quick bite and that's what I got.  Looked pretty outdated inside and even the packaging and utensils needed an upgrade.  For all the variety that exists out there across this cuisine,  unclear why you'd go here.  Nothing special or differentiated as far as the menu is concerned either."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I got the California bowl with a few substitutions. The shrimp was AMAZING, I just wish there had been a little more of it. Will definitely have to order from here again!"}
{"text":"I just want to bring my family during a nice post holiday dinner. However, no one helped me move some tables to occupy eight of us. I asked the asian guy with glasses if we can move some tables to help us occupy for it. But, he responded, \"Just put them back.\" Is this how you run an F&B business. Im not being nosy or being too critical. Although, this is a basic common knowledge that he should help us. This is just a small place to eat at. This was around 8pm during a thursday night wherein there are less than 20 customers on the floor. He handled it poorly. Therefore, this guy needs more training i dont care if he is the manager or whoever but he needs to know respect. I've worked for an F&B Company. This is just disrespectful. Food was good. But what was astounding was the sauce. The salsa was great."}
{"text":"Everything was ok till the employee was coughing all over the food and didn't try to wash there hands..... Wait he didn't use his hands to cover his mouth he just coughed out in the open. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't bother. Dirty inside and they don't listen to your order. Too many other awesome spots to eat around there w better food and service"}
{"text":"I came here last night with Donald for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos after 2pm). There were quite a bit of people dining inside since they had the special going on, but there wasn't any line at all, so we got our food right away. We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner! The fish was cooked well and the cabbage was fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was the corn tortillas because they were pretty thick and broke easily, but that wasn't a big deal. i just wish there was a Rubios closer to my side of town!"}
{"text":"The steak in the tacos was served cold and when the food was brought out chips and bean dip didn't come with either plates, even though we ordered two plates. I asked the manager if the plates came with chips and bean dip and she didn't respond, just gave attitude, came back with it and I said thanks, and she didn't say a word. Alright food, poor customer service. I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"Taco trucks are hard to find in Henderson, which means that great, fast and simple Mexican food is hard to find in Henderson.  Residents are left with the dregs -- Roberto's burnt, rubbery carne asada, Taco Hell and the corporate chains.  

In the field of chain Mexican food (Qdoba, Chipotle, Rubio's, Baja Fresh), Rubio's stands apart.  The service is great and particularly friendly at the branch on Green Valley Pkwy.  And the food is fresh and tasty (well, tasty enough).  The burritos are fairly standard for a chain place (i.e. not too bad, not too good) with a good black bean seasoning and good (not great, but good) quality steak or chicken.  So two stars on the burritos in general.

But Rubio's is really known for it's fish tacos--based on the classic San Diego fish taco.  And that's where Rubio's scores five stars--best chain store fish tacos served outside of California.  Crispy and tasty with fresh cabbage.  So if you visit, expect the food in general to be decent and the fish tacos to be excellent.  Overall, the menu evens out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Don't ya hate it when your favorite menu item is removed? (I realize this is a first world problem.) I used to go to Rubio's for their grilled mesquite shrimp burrito. Since they don't have that anymore, I don't have a \"Rubio's fav\" anymore. No reason to go. A friend of mine chose it as our lunch location the other day & so I went. Tried the current taco special. Can't remember what it was, so it didn't leave an impression. The mesquite grilled shrimp burrito was the only thing I ordered! If I craved it - I knew what I was having for lunch or dinner. No more.  It's been over a year since I've chosen Rubio's. It takes time for me to find a favorite, and I don't want to start over again, especially if there is the risk of it being removed from the menu! So much work thrown aside! Ha! Funny but true."}
{"text":"Rubio's is ok when I want a chill place to relax while I'm having lunch either on the patio (if you don't mind the noise from the road) or in the dinning room.

The fish tacos are in a heavy batter and are decent. I also enjoy the chicken burrito. I do think the pricing is a skosh high considering this is more like a fast food place."}
{"text":"The fish taco was everything!!! The shrimp taco was just ok!!! I definitely will be back to enjoy the fish tacos!!!

1/14 my second time here and I won't be back...it's like a hit or miss. My 1st time the fish taco was delicious this time very fishy...I know it is fish,  but too fishy to me = not fresh. Those pinto beans are so bland, no seasoning at all!"}
{"text":"Rubios is one of my favorites, its got a great atmosphere, super nice employees, and its great if you're a pescatarian like me. Rubios offers a lot of choices."}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with Rubio's!  The mango habanero taco is sweet and not too spicy- it is a gem!  My husband favors the beer-battered fish burrito.  I have to say it is mighty delicious but a little more caloric then my fav grilled fish tacos. Also good, the regal springs tilapia taco is creamy, crunchy, and flavorful.  The new chimichurri is intensely flavorful with its many herbs and spices.  It is good but not for every palate.  We have visited locations all around the valley and they are all consistently good.

Make sure you try the salsas at the salsa bar.  We eat tons of the green salsa as well as the traditional red salsa.  Put an extra squeeze of lime on the chips and tacos and you can sit back, relax, and pretend you are on the Pacific coast enjoying a fresh meal."}
{"text":"Ok first of all I go to rubios probably 6 times a month. I get the same exact thing every time. A grilled veggie burrito without the grilled onions and peppers.  Leaving the rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, pico, sour cream, and guac inside. They delivered my food to my table and said they could make it because everything is \"pre mixed\". Every other rubios I've ever been to has done and executed my order exactly as I ask. What if I was allergic to onions or peppers? It makes no sence. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very SLOW service! One cash register open while myself and 5 others waited 15 minutes before being able to place our order. Good food but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was as expected, and not much different from other Rubio's locations.  I stuck with the fish tacos, so I can't really compare portions of other menu items.  Overall, it was what I thought it would be and convenient when inside the Red Rock Casino.

Service was great and there were no delays or problems getting the food."}
{"text":"Above-average American-Mexican fast food. Good salsa bar. My wife swears by the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Love their food, so easy to order for pick up, fast. All the workers are friendly and NEVER make mistakes in the orders!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service from the clerk helping us order.  She informed us if we went back a few days later there was a special where everyone who ordered would receive a free bag.  We missed that, but at least she told us about it.  I ordered the original fish taco since I had a card for a free one from a yelp party.  I don't care for anything breaded, but the dressing was good.  Also, they do have a salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing. Hallie had exceptional customer service that was out of this world. I was having a stressful day but her passion to help and be kind really picked me up. The food is delicious and consistent with the other locations. I got my food fast and it looked amazing, tasted even better. I will be stopping by here again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Fast food so call Mexican food. Nothing authentic. Outside patio was dirty and smelled on urine."}
{"text":"I only really come here during Tuesdays when they offer $1.50- $2 fish tacos after 2pm. Who can resist delicious fish tacos for cheap? Sometimes, depending on how hungry I am, I can eat about 6 of them. The fish always comes out crispy and their sauce is delicious. You can even add avocado to your tacos for a little bit extra but its so worth it! They also have multiple salsas available to compliment your meal. 

Its located in the same corner as Starbucks is. They have seating inside and outdoors for when the weather is tolerable. Lots of tables available and someone is out bussing the tabled every 15 mins or so. You can also watch them prepare your food since their kitchen is very visible."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Rubio's in years because I was not a fan of the menu. I am glad that I returned. I love that my food was brought to the table. The condiments bar is a nice place to add some more flavor to your meal. Food was light and filling. I didn't feel heavy and overstuffed afterwards. A big step up from other \"Mexican\" fast food places."}
{"text":"Rubio's is always a nice refreshing change from the other sit down fast food style places.  It is well decorated with fish and surfboards along with other sea side images. Palm tree tables are fun to sit under.  Great place to go for conversation on a date.  

I love their shrimp burrito's and they have the best salsa bar!  I love that they also put out whole lemons because I do like a lot of lime and lemons on my shrimp.  

The place is always clean even during high peek hours.  Must warn you the peek hours are packed!! This place is a very happening spot. Mainly the food is fast and it is good so makes for an excellent stop for lunch with coworkers.  

Outdoor setting area with covered palm tree umbrellas to keep you out of the sun and sometimes they have the misters going.  

They also have refreshing margarita's and ice cold beer."}
{"text":"This place does not pay attention to what they are doing.  I ordered chicken, they gave me shrimp.  I am highly allergic to shrimp.  I brought them up to the counter and had to argue with the cashier to give me my money back.  All I had done is open the taco to look at it and saw the shrimp.  Eating it would have put me in the hospital.  Not a place to go if you are allergic to shrimp because as I stood there and watched the cook, cross contamination everywhere.  Never again. My life is worth more than a taco."}
{"text":"The best Fish Tacos! I come here almost every Tuesday for the fish tacos specials. The fish tacos here seems more bigger and very very delicious. The staffs here are nice and would deliver the food to your table."}
{"text":"Tried Rubios because they were open at 10am and I was starved for lunch (ate breakfast at 4:30am). Tried the HealthMex Chicken Burrito. It was very good. With the rice it was almost too much food for lunch. I like the salsa at Manuels and Macayos better, but the food itself is indeed fresh and tasty.
This store is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is ready quick. Parking is easy and close. It is located in the Riverview shopping center on Dobson and the 202 freeway."}
{"text":"This place used to be so cool. They used to have a fish tank as you came in the door but sadly now it's gone. Food is good but someone really needs to scrub this place clean. This visit the ammonia smell was present as soon as you walked in the door. The bathroom was a mess and the floors needed a good mopping. It's in a generally good location but other locations are much cleaner."}
{"text":"i think this is the one for premium outlets south. amazing they have lobster. but $13 for a lobster burrito. oh well its vegas. kinda redic for fast food. but when ya starving ya starving. asked for extra guac and they actually put it in ( very little lobster of corse) they cut my burrito in half which was a nice touch none of the other ones do it. the guy even spelled my name right. i didnt look at the other places to eat there. but yes i love rubios but ya its not cheap. love the salsa bar and chips"}
{"text":"I really like Rubios, but the service last night was completely unacceptable. I brought my friends from out of town and I am disappointed with the first experience they had. They forgot to make my friend's order, and she waited 20 minutes until she found out that is what was taking so long. They forgot. Even when she corrected the cashier after she had paid that her order was taken down wrong. The cashier yelled that it wasn't her fault to the cooks and didn't accept fault to my friend. We were never asked flour or corn tacos, which they are supposed to ask, so I had them take back my order when I saw it was corn tortilla. The cashier/server did not say one word when I told her of the error and when she brought back the order the way I wanted it. Dead silence. That is horrible customer service. They didn't even offer anything to my friend for forgetting to make her meal. All she got when she asked to my compensated for the inconvenience was 2 free taco vouchers (when she bought a meal, not just 2 tacos). And she is from out of town, leaving tomorrow, so she just gave them to me because she can't do anything with them. I am very disappointed with the service last night. I doubt I'll ever go back to this location, which I used to frequent. I will call the manager today. Hopefully there is one on a Sunday. If they reconcile, I'll change my view, but for now, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I have finally decided to try this Rubio's and can say they are good for the Ono Burritos which had flavor and texture.  The tacos were ok but not impressive just as the beans. Prices were fair for burrito but tacos should be cheaper. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos.  Definitely a notch up from some other places.  They have way more to offer and seem to be more fresh.  High quality and fast service is what I like and that's what they give me.  Yum!!  I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I love Rubios! I have only had a few things here, but I have recently been getting the Grilled Veggie Burrito and it has been salivatingly delicious each time, so I have praise it. If you want something meatless, yet savory, this burrito hits the spot. You also gotta love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order from the blonde cashier and I always feel so bad because I can never remember what I tried the time before. But she is always so patient with me and helps me choose the burrito I love. The entire team here always has a smile on their face and makes me want to walk in even when I'm not hungry for lunch. They are an incredible team/business!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, great customer service, greeted everyone who came in.

Ordered the Steak and Lobster taco. Both weren't bad, pricey but why not try it.

Lobster seemed as if it was crawfish haha"}
{"text":"The original fish taco has a big hunk of meat. This ain't no wimpy Taco Bell taco. A la carte is priced at 2.79. But I suggest the combo at 6.49, which comes with two tacos, rice and beans and a drink. Hey, no need to tip. 

They have a clean salsa bar with about 8 different salsas. Sliced limes are set out too. Try their raspberry tea on tap. It's tasty. 

Our cashier Ramon had a smile. A lady's toddler dumped something on the floor and Ramon mopped it up and was like \"no problem\".

Outdoor seating is plentiful and each table is covered by a tiki umbrella."}
{"text":"The salads here are very underrated!  I opt for the chicked ranch every time.  Add the homemade hot sauce with some fresh limes and wow not a bad lunch for like 6 bucks!

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The wife wanted to try this place, so I obliged. She got the shrimp tacos and I ended up getting some type of fish tacos. I wasn't overly impressed and neither was she. Just o.k., not great."}
{"text":"This is a great place for affordable, good quality, Mexican food. The burritos have lots of flavor in them and are seasoned very nicely for a good Mexican taste. The salsa bar is great and let you add your own onions and cilantro to your salsa which helps since people can choose how much onion they want in their salsa. The staff is very friendly and the food comes out at a good pace. I love the fact that they use silverware and ceramic plates. The only thing I would say is that the food portions are not as big as I would prefer."}
{"text":"I only go to Rubio's for one thing : Chicken California Bowl. If you think about it, you can get something far superior to a Chipotle bowl for less than the Chipotle bowl with guacamole. It's also a gigantic meal and I always split it into two. The California bowl has the standard rice, beans, meat, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo, with a choice of red or green salsa. The game changer is the chipotle sauce which is probably sour cream with chipotle but it really keeps the bowl from being too dry even if it no doubt adds calories. There's a salsa bar where you can get more salsa, onions and cilantro, limes, jalapeños and carrots. It's a little difficult to navigate quickly with the small cups they give you but I usually go back 2-3 times. Rubio's usually gets pretty packed around lunchtime and I see people leave as soon as they see the line but it goes by quickly."}
{"text":"30 minutes to make 4 fish tacos and they screwed up the order.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in at about 1130 am Saturday morning 9/12/15.  The food was delicious and the staff was exceptional.  I watched the ladies cooking in the kitchen and could literally sense the love they were putting into each dish they prepared.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I usually don't branch out from standard quesadillas and burritos, but I tried the fish taco's and really liked them. I did also get a quesadilla on another occasion and really liked it, especially b/c it came with sour cream and guac, which a lot of places charge extra for. Also, it was crispy and hot, unlike a lot of places which come out greasy and soggy. 

I will probably go here again with my friends who really like this place."}
{"text":"Was driving around after doing some Christmas 'browsing' and really didn't know what I wanted to eat. Wanted to try someplace new.....saw Rubio's and ended up trying it. 

Small and clean restaurant. Ordered from their menu board placed over the register area. Decided on the Carnitas Rajas burrito. 

Since I was the only one there at the time the food came out extremely fast. 

All the ingredients of the burrito did indeed seem fresh....but as a whole the dish didn't do much for me. There was a chimichurri sauce in the burrito that kind of overpowered everything else. I think I would have liked it better without the sauce. 

I did try the roasted chipotle salsa from the salsa bar and found that very, very good. Nice dark and rich salsa with a chocolaty after taste.It doesn't taste anything like it looks. When was the last time you thought.....\"Hmm....I'm in the mood for some food that's colored black.\" 

So I may try it again sometime in the future and get the carnitas burrito without the chimichurri sauce.....but with the roasted chipotle salsa instead. That sounds a lot better. 

I'm giving this 3 stars because it was right in the middle of the road for me. Nothing great, nothing awful. I will probably try it out again but order something different than what I had tonight."}
{"text":"Rubios is the holy grail of Mexican fast food chain restaurants. It is a bit expensive and the portions are a tad bit small but there is quite simply nothing that compares for this type of restaurant in fast food. Now, it is definitely not authentic, but if you know that going in, you won't be disappointed. 

Also, let me be clear, there are a ton of better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix but this is a place you can count on to fill your craving every time. It is the best Mexican FAST FOOD out there. I constantly crave the fish tacos and drool over the baha grill burittos. If you want quick fast food with a Mexican flavor, this is a great choice. The staff are very friendly at this location as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the fish tacos & mahi mahi burritos. The service at this location is the absolute best!  The staff is very friendly and they always check back to see if everything was good. Love this rubios !!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, clean buffet and tables and SUCH DELICIOUS FOOD OMG
I'm gluten free and the cali bowl with tomatillo sauce and grilled mahi gave me no problems (not celiac, but very sensitive). A little expensive looking when you walk in-- but the quality is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple tacos for my first time going there and honestly for some small tacos, they charge a bit too much. Ive been to an authentic mexican restaurant that was as good and maybe even better (Taste wise) but at a more reasonable price. either way, was delicious"}
{"text":"Rubios is always a favorite. I just stopped in for some seafood tacos and Anthony was very cordial and informative. He also seemed to be interacting and assisting the other staff as well. It is nice to see effective leadership. The food and salsa were delicious as always and it was nice to eat off of real silverware and plates. When did they start serving alcohol?! Right on..."}
{"text":"Always use this location for my door dash delivery. Food is amazing, great original fish tacos and really food steak. Chips and guacamole is always a must. Fresh food that's not greasy!"}
{"text":"We're out of towners, and we were looking for someplace to bridge the gap between fast food and real Mexican food.  Rubios. was a nice quick fix.  We split a two taco plate and thought the ingredients were reasonably fresh. (way better than that Taco Bell place) and the service at this location was VERY friendly and helpful.  We thought the serving of beans was pretty minimal, and the salsa was lackluster, but acceptable, but the tacos were great.  Wouldn't go out of my way to find a Rubios, but in the fast food market, definitely a strong option!"}
{"text":"Oh so good! Thank you Rubio's for serving great fish tacos not made with tilapia :)"}
{"text":"This has the best salad at a fast food joint!  I would recommend eating salads here, it is the only place that serves NO iceberg lettuce in their salad.  They also serve a good portion of either chicken or salmon in their salads, I've had both.  They have other proteins.  The dressing is good.  Do NOT GO to El Pollo Loco, Smashburger, Black Bear Diner, Denny's, Village Inn, Carl's, any other fast food joints or restaurants bc they serve ICEBERG LETTUCE (NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE) & charge too much money for poor-quality salad.  Rubio's also has the best tacos for a Mexican fast-food restaurant not the Mixteca, Herrera's, Filiberto's nor Julioberto's."}
{"text":"The food is freshly prepared and far lighter and more flavorful than any fast food place.  The service is pleasant and efficient, at close to fast food prices.  

The mahi mahi is so flavorful, and I love the grilled fish burrittos, especially Baja style - some of the best I've ever had!  The fish tacos are also excellent, any way you get them (I've tried many different versions, always great)."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan of Rubio's and will be as long as they keep doing what they do. 

Grilled fish tacos/burrios...YUM!!! That's basically all I care about here. Decent salsa bar, sodas blah blah blah...end of story. Come...Eat...Go forth happy"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've never actually been to this location, and I have only ever eaten one of their menu items.  That having been said...

The Mango Habanero Pacific Mahi Mahi Taco is TO DIE FOR!!!

Rubio's was a featured vendor at one of the Yelp events I attended, and I simply could not get enough of these deeeeeelicious tacos.  (I only hope nobody was paying too close attention to how many times I went back for more...ehem...)

And in addition to the tasty tacos, the staff members were awesome.  Friendly and fun.  Super professional...not one of them shamed me for coming back again and again.  And again.  (And maybe once or twice again.)  Thank you for that. :)

Cannot wait to indulge in some more mango habanero mahi mahi tacos when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"I have not been to any Rubio's in a long time. I used to go so often that the manager at the location near where I lived (Keith at Power & Baseline) used to know my name and my order and as soon as I walked in he'd call back to the cooks to get some Mahi going. It was great back then. I moved away from the area and have since tried different locations. My last few trips to different Rubio's locations were pretty disappointing.

Today, that changed!

I was at work and needed to grab something fairly quick. I decided to give Rubio's another shot. I'm glad I did. Most of the staff was clearly new, because the manager, I believe he said his name was Will, was sort of micro-managing everyone. At first I thought maybe he was just a jerk of a boss. Then it became obvious that he was doing it because it was necessary. He double checked every single order that came out of the kitchen and corrected the cooks (nicely) on whatever wasn't just right. I liked that. It assured me that quality control measures were in place and that he was making sure that the staff learned how things need to be done.

The young man at the counter was very new and he seemed nervous at first but the manager kept giving him pointers and pep talks about getting orders correct and asking questions if he needed to. The kid did a great job, and even made helpful suggestions to me when I couldn't decide things about my order. He did great.

I was not only impressed with the staff, but the food was great this time! It was better than I've had at Rubio's in a LOOOONG time. It's how I remember things being years ago when I frequented Rubio's multiple times a week. I switched it up from the Mahi to the new Tilapia tacos and they were delicious. They were a good size, and the fillings were generous like they used to be. The last few times I had been to Rubio's the tacos were really sad and hardly had any fish in them. This time they were perfect and fresh.

There were only a few things I didn't like, but none that would keep me from going back:
1-the wait time was kind of long. However, I'd rather have freshly prepared food, that is made correctly, than to have something quick and be disappointed, so I let that slide completely.
2-the limes in the salsa bar were a little sad. You can tell when sliced limes have been sitting because they get brown around the edges of the peel...that's how these were. Fresh limes would've been nice. 
3-the bathroom smelled gross. It was very small and didn't seem well ventilated. I don't necessarily think it was dirty, but it definitely didn't smell good. Perhaps a better fan or an air freshener of some kind might help.

For the people who talk about the management change, Will did mention to me that he has only been at that location since March, so if you went before that and had a bad experience, maybe give it another shot because I thought it was great today.  :)"}
{"text":"I eat at Rubios at least 4 times a week. The food is always fresh and very good and the employees are friendly and accommodating. This location is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here. The store looks tired & the table we sat @ was so sticky our plates stuck to it.  I had the fish taco especial.  One of the fish fillets was undercooked & mushy.  Didn't care for the refried beans either.  Think the Plato meal @ Del Taco is WAY better!"}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS delicious here. I've been on the \"grilled Ono burrito\" train lately. I suggest you all climb on board."}
{"text":"Saw they had some new stuff on their menu and figured I'd give it a shot. The Alaskan Salmon burrito was surprisingly amazing. The salmon was done very well with the sauce. My only knock was the dude taking the order looked about as happy as a Marine waiting in line for yoga class (which I'd assume wouldn't be thrilled). He seemed more interested in joining his family  (I would be lead to believe) sitting over in a booth than actually being cordial. Now, I don't exactly blame him. Who really wants to be with strangers when friends &/or family is around. Who knows. Either way the place was very clean and the food was awesome. My only recommendation is next time crack a bit of a smile, it helps customers feel less of an annoyance. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and menu selections, unbelievably fresh, and Top-Notch service. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"My best friend and I had just finished hiking South Mountain. Swung by for some good solid food. Always use to come to this rubios back when it first opened for many years. Until we got one that was closer to our house. These three individuals SHINED like no other!! Jason, our cashier, Asada,  the Manager and Dev, the cook. SMILES ALL AROUND and customer service was more that 100%. The moistest chicken I have EVER HAD! My best friend LOVED her mahi salad. she said she had never had a salad taste so good. SO KUDOS to these 3!!! Thanks for making our experience memorable! We'll see you every Thursday until the weather gets hot."}
{"text":"This is the best Rubio's I have been to. 

The standard good:
Tacos- steak, chicken, grilled fish, breaded fish, shrimp, all yummy
Ice cold beer
Help yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons, limes, and jalepeños, too.

This location's extra goodness:
Cute Tiki patio...huge lighted tiki umbrella, and at least one other smaller tiki umbrella. I forget to take pix a lot, sorry! 
Exceptional customer service- especially the two dark hair young women. The cashier and the expo girl worked very well together. They served food to customers, kept everything clean, were quick and efficient during the lunch rush and did everything with a smile. I wish I knew their names to mention.

Try the new mango habenero ono taco! 

Good place if you have children."}
{"text":"Walked in to a very clean and aesthetically pleasing fast food restaurant. Instantly great by the cashier who was a very nice bald dude. I ordered the special which was a steak and a salmon taco with greens and it was delicious. While I was eating that very same dude ask how it was and also brought silverware which I myself forgot to grab. This Rubio's Mexican grill far exceeded my expectations. I will be coming back. Ps that cool bald dude needs a raise!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, and so are salsas but the lobby needs some major tlc. 
Rips on benches, mismatched wobbly tables, not to mention it needs a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"Rubio's is right by my house and I was starving one day on my way home. I ran in just to get chips and salsa because I am a gluten free vegan (most of the time) and when I mentioned this to the manager he made up a meal for me so I could have a full lunch. Awesome customer service! My meal was delicious too!"}
{"text":"The salsa verde shrimp tacos are my favorite! The flavor of the salsa is delicious. They are always my go-to (along with chips and guacamole) when I come here. I work down the street and frequently phone in my order saving me lots of time waiting for my food to be prepared."}
{"text":"Perfect shrimp tacos. Great flavors. Very inexpensive. Nice break from baja fresh and chipotle. Flavors are more authentic mexican. We went back twice we liked it so much."}
{"text":"This store is the closest to me and I frequent it a lot.  I think there's been an ownership change recently.  Now when I order the taco especial, I'm always upset when I get home to find that they gave me the cheaper original taco.  This has happened more than once.  I think I'll start going to other Rubio stores instead of this one."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the food :( I ordered chicken nachos to go and I knew that they might be a little soggy, but the chips were so stale. $9 for a plate of stale soggy nachos; yuck!"}
{"text":"love dem burritos!

my hubby and i come to rubios several times a month. we love the hot, fresh chips, the flavorful salsas and the delicious veggie burritos. i recommend to my friends often."}
{"text":"Mentioning my name in certain circles is verboten. Never mention Rex Marvin at the San Antonio Community  Quilting Bee...apparently quilting the greatest moment of your sexual history isn't appropriate for a 12 year old looking to enter the competitive world of quilting.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the National Bowling Stadium...apparently streaking across the lanes with \"This Isn't A Real Sport\" on your buttocks is a faux pas.  The beer and bratwurst crowd can be a touchy one.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the Birmingham Alabama \"Is This Your Sister or Your Wife\" Blueberry Festival...apparently screaming \"anyone who didn't take a bath with your future wife as kids aren't really married in this state\" is a little too close to the truth for most. (On a side not, moonshine, incest and the bible is a dangerous combination. A lot of bad ideas are formulated.)  And never...ever...ever mention the name of Rex Marvin at the Kentucky Apple Festival...I will just say this...when someone tells me there is an apple festival...and there is no Apple Spinach Lasagna then you get what you deserve...and if that means holding the Apple Queen down (a guy in a dress by the way)...and putting apples in every cavity...then you take it like a man...a man in a dress with shaved legs and a date that couldn't tell he was a man.
 
In most Mexican food restaurants...chain restaurants... there is a written rule to ban Rex Marvin on sight. They won't announce this policy...if you mention Rex Marvin they will call the cops and have you escorted out.  Only Del Taco has publicly stated on a Danish Crime Show roughly translated as \"Man Who Can't Salt Fish Correctly\" that I will be killed even if I try to go through the drive thru.  I have taken that on as a badge of all that is right in the world.  (Secretly, I go in to Del Taco's and eat their crappy food while writing 'Tom Sizemore banged your mom' on bathroom stall walls.)
  
I take Mexican food very seriously, because it is great when you just take great ingredients and don't mess them up. Most places use over processed crappy ingredients and used heavily handed sauces.  Fresh, simple and flavorful. Chain Mexican food restaurants seem to remove the flavor when they defrost the meat outside in the sun.  Canned vegetables. Premade sauces. Frozen food. Is there any reason that 4 of my 9 felony convictions have been committed in a fast food Mexican place? Instead of the Twinkie Defense I used the Canned Crap defense.
 
When I woke up behind a Rubio's after 3 days of snorting bath salts and Pine Sol. Trust me it is something that is really best left to the professionals.  I woke up to a great smell...actually I woke up to 3 guys carrying trash cans and drinking low grade sake out of a plastic jug.  Three shots later I was ready to eat. Nice guys. Bought two Chinese stars and some fireworks.  They kept smiling and speaking Finnish...weird blonde bastards.
 
I went into Rubios and it was a revelation. Very reasonable priced. Very good food. All of the chips are made fresh daily. The standout is the fish taco.  I have gone back several times and I have bought the battered fish tacos (I suggested calling it the Rihanna but they didn't go for it) and they were great every time. Get the Especial, very good guacamole and cilantro. Worth the 40 cents.  The Burritos are very good and a good size for the price. The salad has a lot of good things in it, not just lettuce and the blows are good if you are into that. They are light.  The taquitos are good, but not crispy enough the time I got it. The main thing is that this place uses great ingredients. The times I have eaten there I have loved the food.  Is it as good as a great local place...no, it can't be. It is still a chain, but a good chain...like the one from my scrotum to my nipple. 

It does have a decent sauce bar. The three sauces range from very good to okay. They have roasted pepper sauce and the best one. There is a salsa verde, but it is the weakest one. They have a spicy piccante which is good, but one note.

The bad...the sides are not great. The beans are just awful. Very soupy. Not much flavor. The rice was dry. The sides are very important and seem like an after thought here. Sad, because it would be better rated if they cared about their side dishes. 

I won't eat there all the time. I won't eat there when I have better alternatives, but I will go back. I like it. I don't love it. It is how I feel about the girl who I peep into her windows. I like her enough to look...not enough to stalk. Fine line? Yes. A line nonetheless? Yes."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! $13.82 for a 2 taco combo and a drink! Tacos had a table spoon full of meat each then they add lettuce??? That's no taco they even tasted bland. If your in Vegas I suggest to go to tacos
el Gordo by downtown that place is amazing it's the first time I ate tacos that are super authentic they taste identical to their location in Tijuana!"}
{"text":"I found the cashier, who happened to be wearing a manager badge, to be extremely rude and condescending. We were the only customers in line, they weren't very busy, but he replied to every aspect of our ordering with an attitude and snippy remarks such as, \"I just said that\" when I simply asked for confirmation about the order. I'm sure the food is fine but I was so irritated with the ordering experience we actually walked out after paying without waiting for the meal. I don't know if this experience reflects the values of the chain or is specific to this store but this particular individual shouldn't be customer facing."}
{"text":"Over a year since I wrote my review on this Rubios and it's still our favorite! Janet is still amazing and you can tell her workers like her as well. Thanks for always making our dining experience great :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to one of these places in years.  I was going to eat some really good steak but hey I am holiday shopping here and might as well grab a bite.

The food is good.  I ordered the Fish Taco Special and the Blacked Tilapia Taco with pinto beans and tortilla chips.  I also got their mild and fire-roasted salsas.  Well, the salsas suck.  If you like good salsa, this ain't it.

The Fish Taco Special was 90% batter and it was hard to find any fish in there.  Taste was good but I gave this place 4 stars because I received a deep fried batter taco and not a fish taco.

The blacked tilapia taco was decent.  For $4, who can complain.  The pinto beans were very fresh and went well with the chips."}
{"text":"Worst steak tacos I've had in my life. Took one bite and nearly spit it out. Chicken is ok. Jesus that steak though. Unbelievably bad. Dog food at best."}
{"text":"As a former SoCal resident, let me just say that I was happy that even though we moved to Phoenix, you can get a taste of SoCal right here. Rubio's is my go-to when I want to have fast food on the healthier side, although let's be honest, after you order seafood that's fried and thrown in a corn tortilla and add on a Coke, it really doesn't cancel out having a burger at McDs! What I do love about this place is the food is made fresh to order. My usual order is the original fish taco plate, but yesterday I wanted to grab a quick lunch and the sweet employee at the register recommended the shrimp tacos instead. I figured I'd try something new and her suggestion hit the spot! Food came out quickly in under 5 minutes, which I was able to use that time to get my soda from the drink machines, in addition to getting additional limes and picante sauce. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are surrounded by people that have been waiting along with us for over 20 min for their order. No joke at least 8 groups. We ordered 2 tacos. 35 min. 

Restaurants get a rush. It happens. But we should've been informed when we placed our order so we could've had the option of going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have the fish tacos and let me tell you it was a much-needed upgrade from my usual fast-food Taco Bell running. The salsa bar I had an ample amount of options and most of them tasted pretty fresh. The cost was I think just under $10 for my plate and a drink so a little on the high side but is definitely better on your waistline I could imagine then going to the other true fast food Mexican options. Overall though this place is pretty clean and service a consistent crunchy and tasty product."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fish tacos. You get a nice chunk of perfectly breaded n fried fish in every bite and their sauce is soooooo good! Throw on your favorite salsa and/or fresh lime from their self-serve salsa bar and you're set. A mouthful of great flavor, crunch, and spice. 

I mostly always crave for the original fish tacos. They're what made them famous and for good reason. I also like the California bowl with tilapia. A healthy portion of fresco tomato salsa and some guacamole mixed in will keep you coming back for more. I come here at least once a month and I have a feeling that it might start becoming more frequent.

Restaurant atmosphere is a very laid back Mexi-Cali beachside vibe. A reflection of the Mexican inspired, Southern California roots."}
{"text":"Always fresh and very good! I love the gourmet chicken tacos and the fresh salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Never have had bad service or a meal at Rubio's. I always like the tacos (any kind) or a bean and cheese burrito. One of my quick places to stop in for to grab a bite. Never can go wrong."}
{"text":"I came here as I received a birthday coupon for a free entree as I would frequently visit the Rubio's at Monte Carlo as I worked at ARIA.  While I was impressed by the gentleman's professionalism and wishing me a happy birthday, the food was mediocre.  I ordered a shrimp quesadilla and there was substantially less shrimp in my quesadilla then there typically is at the location at Monte Carlo.  Disappointing for the food but excellent service!"}
{"text":"First time there as I just got the birthday dinner coupon I ordered the two taco plate with a tilapia taco and the especial taco the tilapia was good but the especial was the star of the show,my wife ordered the street tacos carnitas she wants to go back again which is rare for her because she is a picky eater.Staff was very friendly and it was clean."}
{"text":"Good food!

I had their fish and shrimp tacos and they were really good. The girl at the counter was in training and really nice. 

The salsa bar was clean and the salsa was pretty fresh. 

I wasn't crazy about the corn tortilla, definitely like the flour tortilla better. 

But either way I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I would recommend rubios for a catered company meal. It's a fun alternative to paradise bakery or that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I came here and had the gourmet shrimp tacos. They were pretty good. But I ordered my son a quesadilla meal from the kids menu and they gave it to me in a tall brown bag? We ordered to dine in... The rice had no flavor. My boyfriend had the burrito especial and said there was nothing especial about it. While I enjoyed my tacos he said the most flavorful thing he enjoyed were the tortilla chips without the salsa. None of the salsa had any kick or flavor. No burn to the mouth whatsoever. Plus the boy at the register gave me grief about ordering an extra taco. All in all this was just an \"eh\" experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for quick tacos or burritos! The Mahi Mahi tacos are my favorite (with the burritos being a close second)! The staff is always very nice and courteous to me and the food always tastes fresh, the salsa bar is always stocked, and I love coming here! I have also ordered the kid's meal chicken bites for my son and he gobbles them every time - and he's rather picky."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and decent prices.  Best fast Mexican food in Arizona.  Give them a try they are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The place seems a little bit slower churning out the food, but it is still what I expect from Rubios.

Healthmex mahi mahi burrito, side of rice and a water cup set me back $7.56 but it was a very fair deal.  :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends during lunch.

I've been frequenting this location for a few years and I have never been disappointed.  The wait for the food is reasonable, even when they're are exceptionally busy.

The employees are very friendly and even though we become a \"regular\" once a week, they even know what we're going to order before we can open our mouth! :)

My usuals consist of one of the following choices:

- 2 Fish Tacos Plate
- Nachos Grande w/ Grilled Chicken
- Fish Burrito & Taco Plate

Always a good choice here.  Food is a great deal for the price!"}
{"text":"Eduardo is awesome!!! My hubby and I stopped by for lunch. On our way out I asked if they sold hot sauce by the bottle, they did not.  He offered to sell me the bags they have, but unfortunately the credit card machine was down so he gave me the bag anyhow!!!! He made my month!!!! Thank you for a delicious lunch and the added bonus sauce!!! Customers for life!"}
{"text":"Your same fried fish taco place and product. Good flavor but very inconsistent. Depends on the shift or the day you might get a a different quality product.

Still a better fish taco then most concepts on Eastern."}
{"text":"I live on the East coast now, but grew up in South Phoenix. This Rubio's is literally the first place I go whenever I come to visit my parents. The place is always bright and clean. And the food is always made quickly and tastes amazing. I can't wait to go next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"4 out of every 5 times we come here it's phenomenal, once in a while they're off their game and the food is no bueno but it's rare."}
{"text":"I like the fish tacos and I will like them even better for half price on Tuesdays after 2:30pm"}
{"text":"A chain but I don't care, until I find a place that has better fish tacos (been searching for years and still haven't found) this place will always be a favorite!

Also, my wife loves their quesadillas (better than most places)"}
{"text":"fave taco spot EVER! rubio's needs to be more recognized - amazing, thumbs up all the way!!! & don't forget to sign up to become a beach club member + taco tuesday is the best day of the week!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Not amazing or anything but not bad. 
The good: 
very friendly service
fish tacos!
tortilla chicken soup was pretty awesome
They have vanilla coke!
The not so good:
My chicken burrito.. I can't remember which one I ended up going with, had tons of quac in it.. I like guac, but I couldn't taste anything else in the burrito. So meh.
Wasn't really impressed with the salsa. I love spicy salsa, but I also want it to have more flavor than JUST the pepper.
Probably will return for more of that tasty soup and taco. :)"}
{"text":"Love them! Super yummy fish tacos. Always have had great service. I enjoy most everything on their menu. Fresh and good."}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them. Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here."}
{"text":"Superior customer service is hard to come by in fast food establishments. This Rubios is absolutely fantastic. The woman operating the register, Marina was wonderful. Always smiling and keeping busy. As a good employee should do. I would hire her in a heartbeat. Keep up the great work at this location guys."}
{"text":"I like the consistency here. Eat here on a regular basis, every couple weeks or so. Never really had an issue. Food is fresh and tasty and staff has always been friendly for the last several months.

The way you toss your trash and plates outside needs to be charged such that birds cannot get into it. Didn't bother me but if it was my place I would make some kind of improvement. 

Thank you for getting rid of the tiki hut thing. That was kinda awkward. Like this location."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. I love the staff and the food. They always make it too notch to make sure it comes out just the way we like it. The staff is very friendly- today Karlita took my order and she was so friendly. It's people like her and the rest of the staff that make us come back! I do wish there was a location closer to home- but we will always be coming here! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for a long time. I have gone here numerous times throughout the years and afterwards i always say never again.dont know how its survived since the 3-4 times ive gone there throughout the many years the food has been extremely mediocre at best,this last time the food wasn't even McDonalds quality and the manager running the expo couldn't multitask to save his life as my order came up b4 others and he set aside as he had his cooks redo an order 2 times = 12 minutes it sat. He did look at it twice. Then with the other order correct and out ,he called my name for my to go order.  Of course meals were cold and runny and quite disgusting.  I promise even though i live in neighborhood i will not eat there again"}
{"text":"Not bad food, better then your average fast food place. If you want something other then Subway, McD, etc this is a good alternative place. Chips with salsa, burrittos, tacos, etc. It all works at this place."}
{"text":"Tonight we were hungry and wanted to try something new
Rubios interior is really cute and reminded me of Taco Cabana
The cashier really made our entire experience great
She helped us with menu options and she was very talkative
She made it fun and very helpful at the same time
She is a great employee
I wish I had gotten her name but she is a young lady
We really enjoyed the food that we got and I was very surprised
I also really liked the chili/salsa bar 
I love chili

I will return to Rubio's"}
{"text":"Shopping at Desert Ridge and it was past lunchtime.   Despite there being only two or three tables occupied and several hours past standard lunch hours, it was a bit untidy.  A few littered tables, some bits on the floor, the salsa bar needed straightened. (Minus a point)  I was waited on at the counter by the manager, who greeted me with a big smile and was very pleasant and patient as I studied the menu.  As it was my first time, I decided to go for the Famous Fish Tacos plate.  They gave me my number, my pop cup, and I mosied over to the salsa bar and filled up some cups with different salsas to try before settling at a high-top by the window.  It wasn't long before another smiling counter-person brought out my order and checked to make sure I had everything I neeed.  Very nice level of service.

Then things started going downhill.  The fish tacos---they  tasted very, very, VERY fishy.  In fact, I started to worry that maybe the fish had gone bad.  (Of course, I didn't think of that until I was halfway thru my second taco!  Eeeek!)  (Minus another point) Now the beans were very good---super tasty!---in fact, I should have gone with just a big plate of them!

But the killing blow---and so many eating establishments, both fast, casual and fine do this and I don't know why!!!!???---was as I started my meal, the manager started sweeping up around my table with a broom and dustpan as I ate.  As I said, the dining room was basically empty, she could have started anywhere else.  Better yet, she could have done something less dust-raising, like clean off the table tops or tidy the salsa bar or clean a bathroom or iron money or SOMETHING!  Do these people not realize what an absolute turn-off it is to be trying to eat and imagining dust from countless other diners wafting around your food?  Yuck!  So, MAJOR point reduction.

Would I eat here again---maybe, maybe not.  There's quite a few quick eat places at Desert Ridge to try out and even though I didn't get sick, there was something not right about those fish tacos.  Or maybe that's just how they taste at Rubios---but I have had fish tacos before that have been delightful.  These were not.    And, like I said, it just irks me to be swept around when I am eating.  So, like I said, maybe...maybe not."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i've been to a Rubio's mainly because the closest one to me is 187miles away! So I went to this location and the girl who served me was Lorena. She greeted me as I walked in and was ready to serve me in 30secs. I had trouble ordering because what I wanted wasn't on the board. (Mesquite Shrimp tacos) I mentioned that I didn't see it and she told me it was no longer on the menu but she could still make it for me! She charged me accordingly and i had exactly what i came for in a matter of 5 minutes! Thanks to the friendly staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"Food was good but wow your employee CHELSEA needs some work in the customer service department! I visited your restaurant today for lunch and it was fairly dead. Seems Chelsea had nothing to do because every chance she got she joined her coworker who was on break in the dining room to sit down and chit chat with her. She talked very loudly about the \"shitty\" close last night and a recent experience she had at a restaurant that gave her food poising. She went on to describe how the food made her puke (mind you there are guest in the dining room trying to enjoy their meal!) not sure where the manager was (I hope she's not the manager) but this girl needs some training!"}
{"text":"Went in with my husband for lunch today and after 23 minutes he went up to ask where our meals were. Turns out the young man at the register is new and mistakenly entered our transaction as a phone order--meaning they anticipated someone coming in to pick it up, not that we were sitting there the whole time. No worries, it happens. We had only hoped they might remake the meal so it was hot and not soggy but the manager went well above and beyond. We didn't ask for anything once we found out and she immediately apologized, offered to remake it AND refunded the entire purchase!!!  WOW!!!!  We are both pretty laid back and wouldn't have asked for anything but a microwave really. I wish I got her name but she is wonderful and embodies true customer service. We have been before but will obviously go back again. To top it all off the food is awesome!!"}
{"text":"fantastic \"verde shrimp tacos\", especially if you substitute the verde sauce with roasted corn"}
{"text":"This rating is on a scale of fast food restaurants and on that scale, Rubio's is pretty much top notch.  The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty, especially the verde salsa...yummy.  There are not too many \"healthy\" options that are that tasty, but it definitely beats the fattiness of Baja Fresh any day.  If we are in a hurry and in an area with Rubio's, it is my pick.  It would be so much better if Texas was invaded by Rubio's instead of Taco Del Mar."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch on Christmas Eve. After running around doing errands, we were looking for a quick place to eat. We did not want a sit-down-eatery, but we did not want a super-fast-food place (think: golden arches). Perfection: Rubio's. For those East Coasters, Rubio's is chain Mexican Grill, similar in style to Panera. Aka: you order, they cook your food (cook, not microwave fast-food-style), and then you pick it up at the counter. 

I got the popular fish tacos (with guac and cheese). Mine was very tasty, I would definitely order it again. I would give these tacos a 4/5 in terms of \"quick\" Mexican! We also got the Atlantic salmon tacos. Not good. Very fishy and very little meat. The chips and black beans were good, so it made the whole trip a 3. I would come back for a quick lunch! The service was very friendly. The attendant at this Rubio's actually brought our food to our table! Great service!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The managers are very nice and you can tell that they actually care about their costumers! (What a crazy concept, huh?)"}
{"text":"Best bean & cheese burritos! I could seriously live off Rubios bean and cheese burritos. Rubios over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Under-seasoned guacamole, overly fishy taste to the salmon (although the rest of the ingredients on the taco was tasty) Nice people who work there though.

The measly 6 pieces of little baby shrimp swimming in my big bowl of cilantro rice made my heart hurt just a little bit.

I feel like Gordon Ramsay, but meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Liked the feel of the place and anywhere with a salsa bar! Food was good and service was great and friendly! Definitely a step up from Mexican fast food and a little bit healthier!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here for fish tacos every Tuesday. We love the fish tacos as well as pretty much everything else on the menu. Store is clean and staff are great. Salsa bar is awesome. Good location. Also has a nice patio for outdoor dining. Easy to park. Can get crowded on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and service.  Manager was very attentive and rounded in all guests.  Restaurant was very clean and salsa bar was very clean.  We ate steak tacos with beans and chips.  It was so fresh.  Enjoyed sitting outside today while it's 87 degrees out in February."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like making a quick run for the border I skip Taco Bell and head here during a Mexican fast-food craving. I'm a fan of their salads & fish tacos. Of course I've had the best fish tacos in the world at Mr. Fish Taco in Puerto Penasco, but Rubios does good in a pinch."}
{"text":"I sometimes get such a craving for this place. This day was no exception! I travel for work, so burritos are everywhere in airports. In turn I eat a lot of burritos! But not all burritos are created equal I quickly learned. I have never been disappointed with the food here, burritos or tacos. I do seem to always gravitate towards the ancho citrus shrimp burrito. It has such good flavor and always taste fresh! Something I feel makes a burrito is the tortilla, and I love these tortillas! Never soggy or fall apart.. or maybe I just eat it that fast who knows. The chips are a lovely bonus and perfectly crunchy. Love all the salsa they offer, even like to mix them together and make my own little flavor combo. Writing this review has now made me incredibly hungry."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's. They just weren't paying attention tonight. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup with corn tortillas instead of flour. My soup came out and was lukewarm. I asked them to warm it up for a few minutes in the microwave. I got my soup back and it wasn't even close to warm. Wasn't worth asking to warm it again. On top of the fact that halfway through eating it I noticed they didn't put slices of avocado in it.... and they gave my flour tortillas instead of corn. 
Kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm on the edge of 3 and 4 stars here. We have been here twice now and neither time has been bad. The staff is very nice and the flavor is solid. A few key things for me here; the first time we came the beans were good but the second time they were bland, not a big deal, but I like consistency.  The chips are ok, add lime and they get a lot better! The burrito was packed with tomatos and guac and a little bit of chicken, the chicken was really good! So we will be back again definitely even if it's only to figure out exactly how we feel about it. And I want to try the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos (used to come here every Tuesday for $1.25 tacos) now that I can't eat those I've been exploring the GF menu. The other night I had a grilled Mahi taco and gourmet steak taco (be careful those come with bacon) Both were really good. I also really like the Pinto beans.. I usually put some salsa and cabbage from my tacos in it. Yum! 

My favorite salsa is a mix the two red ones. I get the bigger salsa cups from behind the counter and do one scoop of each. Try it! 

Service st this location has always been friendly and quick. 

Also they have an easy to use online and in store allergen (dairy & gluten free) menu. 

One of my favorite taco places."}
{"text":"Even though it's a franchise the shrimp dishes are phenomenal and the black beans are good. Clean & friendly. $"}
{"text":"I like Rubios, this time I had fish tacos and they were good. I always feel like it is a little $$ but after I eat there I think it is worth it all. 

I used the dark salsa, it is a smoky type. 

The service was great and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego so this place holds a special spot in my heart. I love everything here. You really can't go wrong with their fish or shrimp. My wife who doesn't like seafood really likes the gourmet tacos. Rubios is delicious and this one was no exception!"}
{"text":"Love Rubio's. Always a good spot to get some delicious seafood tacos. Can't go wrong with the original fish tacos. Coastal trio is great as well. My wife doesn't like seafood but loves their gourmet tacos."}
{"text":"Picture a more taco shack Chipotle if you've never been. This place is pretty fantastic when you want a fairly inexpensive, fairly healthy and pretty dang yummy meal. The boyfriend gets the beer battered fish burrito and I get the Baja chicken burrito, they're pretty sizable and cut in half. We trade one of them for the other persons and it's pretty great combo. Large (free) salsa bar, but I think the sauces in the \"ketchup bottle\" containers are the best. Staff has always been friendly to me, I think you just need to be friendly to them (pretty much the same anywhere you go and anyone you meet). Overall, a good spot-- come here about every other weekend since I live nearby!"}
{"text":"Since there wasn't anything else my friend wanted to eat in this area, we decided to go here to eat mainly because they had a coupon with Yelp check-in. It was $2 off an entree.

The food came out very fast. I had no time to look around the establishment. (Give me some time to go to the restroom!) As far as the food was concerned, it tasted good."}
{"text":"Bombbbbbbbb, amazing food. I love this place so much that i frequent here about 2 times a week. The service is outstanding! Edgar, Daniel and Ariella are too sweet and they always know what im going to order. 

The fish taco is a standout, tasty and sustainably sourced. The red sauce they use on it is very mild though almost like a marinara but it works with that crispy fish fillet. Yummm. 

My ultimate favorite though is the gourmet chicken taco, holy taste buds! 
Let me break it down for you. Served on a corn tortilla with a melted goey white cheese and a crispy layer of cheddar cheese im guessing, crusted on the tortilla like a damn cheese crisp. Atop that is the grilled chicken, red tomatillo sauce that is very flavorful and mild, a creamy chipotle sauce, fresh onions and cilantro and then of coarse bacon! 

YOU MUST GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"First off, the cashier was very friendly. Big smile on her face as she described some of the menu options and helped us choose what to order. 
The food was fresh, and tasted okay (there are better fast casual Mexican options out there), but it's not a great bang for your buck. You could spend about the same elsewhere but leave a lot fuller and/or with plenty of leftovers. The salsa bar is a nice touch. The interior is clean, but not as visually appealing as other Rubios I've been in."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, but because it's freshly prepared, as they claim, it is noticeably better than say, Chipotle. I wasn't too impressed with the pricing (gourmet tacos coming to about $4 each), but I did enjoy them. The salsa bar is a nice touch, and I do dig the Mexican beach theme."}
{"text":"I always come to Rubio's for Taco Tuesday. The service is always friendly with a smile and super polite! The restaurant is always kept clean and the salsa bar stocked. Keep it up you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Went in after trying to get a hair cut at supper cuts that didn't happen cuz on unprofessional hair cutters. I was so hungry and orders the shrimp tacos it was so good and the wife had the bean n cheese burrito she ate that right up. Staff was amazing and was very clean inside. Will go here tomorrow for sure."}
{"text":"Their service is fine
Their staffs are  very attentive and good energy.
Food is very fresh and delicious.
Seems Surfer friendly.
Kids loves the kids menu."}
{"text":"On our way to watch John Wick 2 and we were pressed for time. Wanted to grab a bite to eat and ended up at Rubios. It was our first time there so we had no idea what to expect. Walked in to a very clean well decorated establishment. It was a rainy day so it wasn't too busy but there were still a good amount of happy patrons eating. We ordered the mahi mahi tacos and the hubby got the 3 street chicken tacos. Sat down and we're served super fast. The tortillas were really dry, but the sauce and the good goopy stuff made it more moist. (Moist is the best word) the fish tacos were delightful and very light. My sexy bearded husband enjoyed his tacos and the side of beans. I enjoyed the salsa with a hint of heat with my side of chips. As a bonus they had vanillas coke there. Overall we will definitely go back and order something else on the menu. It was a good day to try something new."}
{"text":"This review is based on company caterimg. Second time this week, catered lunch. I tell new employees to expect to gain 20 lbs working for us because we feed them so well. This time, leadership training for 16 staff members. Another favorite of ours is Rubios. 

Rubios has a great selection of catering packages to choose from; salads, taco bar, burritos, and enchiladas. Everything is fresh and so good. Leaders are always looking for healthier options and Rubios satisfies that criteria. 

This time, we ordered two taco bars and chose the grilled chicken and steak. Wouldn't you know it, the chicken always goes faster than the beef.  The order comes with guacamole, rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, Spanish rice, 3 different salsas, corn and flour tortillas, chopped salad and two large bags of tortilla chips.  Because its a taco bar, everyone can create their tacos or deconstructed tacos however they want to. Sometimes I choose to have a nacho salad but this time I made chicken tacos. So so good. I'll call this one a power lunch; content and fueled up for the rest of the afternoon, no 2 or 3 pm crash."}
{"text":"I work walking distance to this shopping center and every day I eat out for lunch.  
What to choose, what to choose?  Taco Bell, Arbys, McDonalds, Subway, Chick-fil-a, or Rubios?  This is like a laundry list of what Mesa is based on.  

So every day I choose another mediocre place to dine... but once a week I treat myself to Rubio's Cali-Mex Restaurant.  It's just delightful!  It's hard to steer clear from the Beer-Battered Fish Burrito.  If I can make it there on Tuesdays after 2:30, I partake in Taco Tuesday where it's just $1.25.... Those 4 tacos are the best $5 spent in town.

Thanks Rubio's, see you next week!"}
{"text":"I agree with many that the prices here are a bit high but the quality of the food makes it worth the price.  Today, my wife and I had the mahi mahi burrito and the salmon tacos. Both were so dang good.  The burrito was full of fish, guac., rice, and chipotle sauce. I enjoyed every bite. My wife loved her tacos. I am not a huge salmon fan but I did think they were good.  The chips are not great in my opinion but the food more than makes up for it.  If your looking for Mexican and seafood, this may cover the bases for you."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and had been wanting to stop and eat here. So I finally did. It was horrible. Paid over 35 for two average combos. The picture had a drink on the combo but at the counter they told me the drink wasn't included in the price. False advertisement."}
{"text":"I used to basically despise Rubio's until last last year. My previous experiences with the chain has always resulted in bitter disappointment. The sauces were somewhat nauseating and the food always seemed to come out cold. 

Late last year a girl I was dating talked me into going to a nearby Rubio's. Wow. What a difference. I can only assume that Rubio's management changed at some point during the intervening years. The menu was diverse and offered a ton of options for a seafood eater like me. 

The most outstanding dish is the Chile Lime Wild Salmon burrito. This is truly delicious fast food. Grilled salmon and a wonderful light cream sauce. The whole lineup of tacos and burritos is great, with some of the new shrimp creations being the real standouts.\

The location at Riverview is always clean. The staff is efficient, professional, and friendly. I had an issue one time when someone walked out with my order. The manager comped my meal that time and comped me a future meal. I didn't even have time to complain."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos go against everything mi abuelita from East L.A. would have stood for. \"Who puts fish in a taco, mi hijo?\" she would have said. But sometimes I'm just jonesin' for some I can't help but jump in my car to pick some up (with flour tortillas)
They're just so tasty. 

Other times I'm in the mood for a carne asada quesadilla. The steak is a little dry but it goes well with the sour cream guacamole and pico de gallo that it's served with. I love me some of their roasted chipotle sauce too.

The service here is always friendly and efficient. The parking in the strip mall they're at can be hit or miss but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Rubio's is not bad for Mexican food. It definitely won't make you cringe eating. I have had several of the tacos and burritos. It's not too expensive either although you could probably get cheaper stuff at Filaberto's or something. I think their strength is their seafood menu. So if you want seafood Mexican food, I suggest this place."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service. I've worked around the corner for the past four years and the service is always excellent. The manager comes by every time to make sure we're having a good experience and I think the four stars are well deserved!"}
{"text":"Rubio's Grill in general is appetizing, however, this ONE location and their horrible staff has ran me to never want to return to the establishment again.. First, I ordered a dine in Gourmet Grilled Shrimp plate. I waited, and waited, and after 10 mins my order still wasn't called out; finally I went up to the counter and asked an employee where my order was, it was forgotten when set to the side... and it was boxed as a to go order when I had a number for a dine in! When I opened the box, they gave me a measly container with my black beans, probably less than 1/3 of a cup! Then, the food was all cold, the cheese which is supposed to be melted inside, gunked up in a glue form on the side of my hard which was supposed to be soft flour tortilla... Then I asked for a replacement meal, they just plated the same food and heated it up in a microwave.. WHY! I know they're a fast food place but they're also supposedly \"Fresh\" quality.   I wasted my whole HOUR lunch there and didn't even get to eat because my experience was so horrible. All the manager offered to do was give me a refund rather than seeming sincerely apologetic, he just wanted me out of his face.. ONE employee was somewhat sorry but the others, including the Ditzy cashier who messed the order up when placing it, did not acknowledge me whatsoever... this is also the THIRD chance I've given this location because they always mess something up for me, busy or not. NEVER RETURNING TO THIS RUBIO'S LOCATION AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly about the service experienced at Rubio's in Red Rock Station.

My friend originally wanted to order a fish taco platter, but the woman behind the counter informed him it would take some time  to cook. He told her that we were running short on time, so she said that the Salsa Verde Pan-Seared Shrimp Taco platter is an item on the menu that could be prepared quickly, so he ordered that instead. A few minutes turned into 10 minutes. Here's the thing: It wasn't busy, and there wasn't a line. Eventually, my friend returned to the counter and asked about his order, which he noticed was sitting on one of the back counters (thanks for letting us know the order was ready 5 minutes ago!) I didn't try any of the tacos, but according to him they were \"good.\" To me, the presentation was sloppy and unappetizing."}
{"text":"This review is about my experience with my attempt to redeem a coupon for a free taco, but I'm throwing in my previous experiences I've had into the mix, as well. 

Being a Rubio's \"Beach Club\" member, I receive coupons for my birthday and sometimes to try a new menu item for free. Several days ago, I received an e-mail invite to RSVP for myself and a guest to try the new Chimichurri Salmon taco at the Rubio's of my choice. I filled out the RSVP form with my name, the time I was going to arrive, and the Rubio's location where I wanted to pick up my tacos -- Aliante Station. 

I arrived at the Rubio's and waited for a minute or two for someone to appear at the counter. A woman with a bored expression on her face emerges from the back. I tell her that I would like to try the Chimichurri Salmon taco. I tell her that I have the coupon and proof of my RSVP on my phone. She informs me that because they are a FRANCHISE they can only accept PRINTED coupons because it's how they honor coupons...OK. HOWEVER, the coupon states:

\"Print OR present this offer on a MOBILE PHONE to redeem. Offer only valid during date and time listed above. One taco per person. One-time use only. Duplicates not accepted. Not valid with any other offer/discount. No substitutions. No cash value. Please note a photo ID may be required.\"

Doesn't say anything there about franchises not accepting mobile coupons. No matter how many times I tried to tell the lady otherwise, she kept telling me the same trash. Because we were starving, I ended up just buying dinner there: one Avocado Corn Fish taco and a Baja Steak Burrito. The Avocado Corn Fish taco was delicious, but it didn't make up for the crappy service that left a foul aftertaste in my mind. 

Lastly, this isn't the first time I've received poor customer service at this location. Over the years, I've become inured to the service because there aren't many decent food places to choose from in Aliante Station. But I've noticed that whenever I've come to this Rubio's, the service has always been pitiful, and the employees never appear like they enjoy their jobs even the slightest bit, unless they're standing around doing nothing or jackin' around in the kitchen for all to see --- yeah, we can see you. Then comes a customer to ruin the fun.  I only selected this location because we were going to be in the area. Plus, it had been a while since I've visited this Rubio's. I sure as hell didn't know that service remained the same. So much for hoping for some positive changes to be made.

The food's the only thing this place has going for them; the service, forget it. That's the last time this location will get any more of my money.  Never again."}
{"text":"Apparently, the \"Pesky Platter\" is no longer the nickname for the Tacos Especial plate, at least that's what I was told when I tried to order it. I guess it's been ages since I stepped foot inside a Rubio's.

Each year Rubio's sends me a birthday coupon for up to $7.00 worth of free food. Oddly, the coupon expires a week before my actual birthday, so I had to take advantage of the coupon prior to its expiration date. I thought I'd give this Rubio's a go after having discovered it by chance as I was driving to Patty's Closet. It's hardly noticeable from the main roads unless you're really searching for it, or if you get out of your car to visit neighboring businesses. 

It may appear tiny at first glance, but there's additional seating around the corner on the way to the salsa bar and soda fountains. The restaurant in general is clean, especially the counters which were free from saucy spills.

I ordered my usual \"Pesky Platter\" (I'm still going to refer to it by that name!): Two fish tacos especial accompanied by sides of tortilla chips and pinto beans, which I skipped on. I did notice a difference in the tortilla chips, which were thinner, crunchier, and overall just \"lighter\" than the chips I used to order with my tacos.

The staff here is welcoming towards customers, and the service is quick.  My food was delivered to me within minutes of placing my order. 

Not a bad Rubio's to visit if you're in search of something cheap and tasty to eat, and from my experience it easily wins over the ones located in casino food courts."}
{"text":"Someone had to twist my arm to come here and I'm glad they persuaded me. Surprisingly yummy and cheap fish tacos. 
I'm told Rubio's brought the fish taco to the US."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this location which as been very reliable and consistently good over the years until the last month or so.  
  I haven't seen the regular manager during this time frame  and have seen some new faces. Maybe that explains  the changes I've seen? Idk...but something is different at this location.

I have experienced slow service , not so fresh fish and inconsistent cooking and I could swear the fish tacos I had today were smaller than usual. Hopefully that's not a trend.

These are not good changes Rubio's!  Get it together  ASAP!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. The people here at this particular Rubios (2 shift leaders: a girl and guy) were so helpful. They knew exactly what went into the food and were so helpful when they were not sure...they went to the back and checked ingredients. I LOVE people like this especially when you don't expect any sort of reasonable service at a chain fast food restaurant.

3.5 stars for the food. Excellent \"fast food\" type. Me and the hubby had the grilled veggie burrito..with portobello mushrooms, beans, rice and various different veggies. A very interesting sauce and the chips were really good. 

4 stars for the killer salsa bar. With 4 different types of delicious salsa and unlimited refills.

3.5 stars for the price. About $6 for each burrito. A bit expensive for \"fast food\" but really it isn't. But since I'm confused if I just had fast food or not I can't decide if this was a good deal or not. Lots of thoughts going on right now in the old head. 

5 stars for the churro. Warm, powdery cinammon, soft inside...oh gosh....churros are the new elixir. 

Love going to Rubio's when I'm in San Diego visiting the sister but this first visit of mine in the Vegas area has been very promising. 

After a lot of complicated math and averaging and weighing probabilities...I am giving Rubio's in Green Valley a whopping 4 stars. Which is seriously amazing because I give Taco Bells everywhere about minus 300 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken burrito is was 8 dollars, not including a drink. The wasn't even enough chicken in the burrito to make a taco. It seriously sucked no flavor at all. The picante salsa take like .....idk its just awful! Don't eat here unless you like to waste your money on crap"}
{"text":"I LOVE Rubios! However, I will NOT be back to this location. Staff including manager (who took our order) was Rude, unmotivated and extremely sloppy. After telling them the order was to go- twice during him taking the order, he still brought the food out as a sit in. Asked again if I can get it to go and as he huffed and turned around the cook rolled her eyes, grabbed a to go container dumped HALF of my salad in a to go (not even filling it up half way) and set it aside. Then took the chips and set them in the container with the guacamole now under my chips. I'm not normally picky but don't make me pay full price for half ass service with a side of major attitude! Advice from customer: be professional, be attentive.
P.s. I don't appreciate BURNT chicken."}
{"text":"I went to this location the other day and it was great! Food was good, the place was clean, but the best part of it all was the cashier. Kaylie was the most nicest, more friendliest, most kind and helpful employee."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week- I am not a big fan of fish so I went with a chicken quesadilla, and it was delicious. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their chips. They tasted kind of bland and stale. Will be back as it's just down the street from work."}
{"text":"This Rubio's is the best. The owner and staff are very personable. several of the front cash register people know my order when I come in. It is nice to feel at \"home\". 

I love the fresh made burritos. These are not made beforehand and sitting. You can substitute items and make it healthy with a wheat tortilla. They make their sauces fresh as well.

I highly recommend the mahi grilled fish burrito with the chipotle white sauce. It is delicious hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Stay away from this Rubio's if you want to be charged the normal price and not twice as much. Had an argument clearly on my receipt but I had paid for an extra set of black beans the manager at the counter did not give them to me and charge me for them again. I took my receipt back he still could not understand it ended up leaving and getting frustrated over $.89 worth of black beans. What happened to the customer is always right


This is the second time that I've been to this Rubio's and I always wonder if my order is going to be complete as I feel like they don't understand what I am ordering. I eat at a different Rubio's all the time and never have an issue it seems to be this Rubio's in particular. I love Rubio's but stay away from this one"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and each time I am not disappointed. The food is excellent quality and fast and hot.

The last time I came with my 6 yr old granddaughter who wanted nachos. When they arrived they had everything on them. One look and the manager knew this was not right. He quickly took those away and made the biggest cheesiest place of nachos I have ever seen

This place goes above to make you experience a true pleasure"}
{"text":"I've been going to Rubio's for quite a while and I always like the food.   I must say the Rubio's at Tatum and bell has given me  incredible service the managers are awesome especially Daniel. Marcel gave us great service too!!_"}
{"text":"Quality of food and price is not worth it. Chicken tacos were bland and unseasoned. If I'm craving fast food Mexican next time I'll just go to Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and it was surprisingly tasty! My husband had some kind of shrimp tacos with bacon (it was good, I don't think you can go wrong with shrimp and bacon) and I had the beer-battered fish tacos with avocado and corn and some kind of tasty sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed everything except maybe the rice, but the chips and variety of salsa were really good! After checking the nutritional info, I feel slightly scandalized, but not so scandalized that I won't go back, haha."}
{"text":"Never eat here. They got my order wrong and put some spicy sauce on my taco that made me throw up."}
{"text":"Normally I would assign 4.5 stars to this location.  In the last month not so much. Ordered two weeks ago by phone. Had to call three times for someone to pick up and this was for a catered order. First two times someone picked up and disconnected. Today I walked in and witnessed the phone ringing and no one attempted to answer. There were less than 15 patrons and no line to order. 

Manager was at register... Borderline friendly at best. No one was behind us yet felt hurried by manager at register. 

Strange experience for  Rubios as an ironical San Diego native home of Rubios... 

Hopefully next time will be back to the 4.5 I have experienced  for the last 20 plus years being a customer."}
{"text":"Great food. We ate fish tacos, rice, beans, quesadilla, salsas, guac, & chips. 
Well staffed(super rare) 
Excellent service
Clean restaurant
We got fish tacos for 1.50 Tuesday evening. My self & 2 kids ate (plenty!) for 17.99! 
We used a credit card & parking was easy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat, something quick  and fresh. When we pulled up and walked in we immediately heard \"ooh s***...\" Mumbled from one of the employees from the kitchen. It became very apparent that they were preparing to close, and that we had arrived 5-10 mins before they closed. We immediately felt guilty and asked if we could still order and the male employee response was \"well it's not like I can ask you to leave\" he then proceeded to tell us what was shut down and what we couldn't order, it was then we decided to leave.  From my experience it is understood that the close time is when they lock the doors and that is when the clean up happens, and you never turn down an opportunity for more business. Overall this was a poor experience and the employees need more customer service training."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great Service.  Had them deliver for a large event recently, and they were very helpful.  They advised on how much food I would actually need so I would not over order.  Everything arrived and was set up beautifully."}
{"text":"I got the chicken enchiladas.  They were fair, the sauce had some flavor but overall it tasted bland.  I can't speak on behalf of other menu items, but I've definitely had better Mexican fast-casual elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Street Tacos! They are really yummy. I am sad I hadn't tried this place before but will now be back for sure. I got  the 3-plate combo so I got to pick from 3 tacos (chicken, steak or carnitas) and it came with rice and beans. I was able to mix-n-match the tacos so I picked one of each to try them all. They were all good but the carnitas was my favorite. 

Inside is clean and the staff is super friendly. If you sign up on their e-mail list (beach club) you get a nice coupon to go towards the cost of your purchase on your birthday! They also send other promotions. Rubio's also offers catering and fundraising services."}
{"text":"Always good food here! Never disappointed. You would not think the best Mexican food in north Scottsdale Carefree Cave Creek is Rubio's but it is!"}
{"text":"I had the California bowl with chicken. The flavors were great but I really think they get to crazy with the rice and skimpy with the greens.

Like any location the dining area was super clean and the staff very friendly, and it was convienently located."}
{"text":"First time at Rubios in a long time. I had a free lunch coupon. Ordered the street tacos steak and chicken. They were good. Salsa bar was clean and fresh. Good service from the cashier and manager. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Where do I start? This location was the tops! The food was top notch! The nice lady, Tabitha taking our order greeted us with a smile, suggested a wonderful salad for my wife but as we were eating our food I could see she really loves her job with other customers coming in. I haven't been to a Rubios in a while but thanks to Tabitha and the rest of the crew at this location we will be back. 

I had two of the Fish Tacos with a side of Chips/Guac and my wife got a great chicken salad. YUM!"}
{"text":"I'm saddened that I have to give a 3-star rating today for Rubio's...  I talked this place up to my wife, who before this day had never been there. The experience was decent, but the amenities and the prices did not meet expectations. The prices are very high for what you get. We could have gotten an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and a dessert from other places for the price we paid for a salad and a burrito. And saying that the burrito comes with chips is an insult to chips. The plate had about 15 chips on it, barely enough to cleanse your palate. I don't remember the prices being so high the last time I had been there, but maybe I just don't recall. But the worst part is the bathrooms!  First, the men's restroom is massive and only allows one person to use the bathroom at a time, while the women's restroom has three stalls. Then, the soap dispensers were empty, the paper towels were empty and the WORST part...  Neither restroom has a changing platform!!  I had to change my son on the filthy bathroom floor!!  Nasty!  How can you call yourself a family restaurant, when you don't even have a place to change a kid's diaper?!  For the bathrooms alone I would give 1-star, but the food was tasty, which is the only thing saving this review."}
{"text":"I go to Rubio's once a month tonight I happen to be in Mesa off  Dobson & the 202 there were numerous waiting for 40 mins for food myself being one of them. Several people requested their money back. My food tasted cold like a frozen dinner out the microwave, if I get sick ill be back and return the bucket of puke  DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"My boyfriend always enjoys this place! I eat pretty simple, with just a bean and cheese burrito! Very yummy but VERY messy! Not a typical bean and cheese because the beans are whole instead of mashed. Tortillas are amazing!! My boyfriend gets the ancho shrimp burrito and loves it every time. They also have a salsa bar for the chips that come on the side!"}
{"text":"I got \"hooked up\" today. All I ordered was a fish taco to go. Generally speaking the employees are always warm and inviting from the moment you enter. Today was no different. With the price we pay for healthy food one has to ask themselves why would I choose a restaurant chain over a regular sit down restaurant.. because this one in particular doesn't sacrifice quality. Or manners."}
{"text":"Meh! 
So, so.
Dos, Tres.

Had never been to a Rubio's before and wasn't impressed. 

The staff was very  friendly and nice. The restaurant was a bit dirty, with food crumbs on tables. Tables and chairs were disorganized and the floor was filthy. Not a good sign...

Had the Coastal Trio that came with three different fish tacos. Blackened Shrimp and Tilapia were both pretty decent. The third taco was a giant deep fried fish tilapia piece of lard on a tortilla. I wasn't sure how to approach it because is was so big and greasy, so I ended up passing on that. 

Don't see myself visiting another Rubio's and not because it was terrible but because my expectations for Mexican food is pretty high and this place is very far from Mexican Generic Food. Not very tasty and nothing about my visit stood out or left me with the \"come back soon bug.\" 

Maybe in the future I will give them another shot but for now, they remain as one of my least favorite for Mexican."}
{"text":"Terrible.  We had broiled fish tacos...sauce was bland.  Fish dry and fishy tasting.  Tortillas hard.  Salsa bar everything was spicy.  Taco came w avacado.hardly any in the taco.  Disappointing.  Based on this location would not go to rubios again.  Baja fresh much better."}
{"text":"Fresh yummy food. You cab even get a beer! (I hear Taco Bell is going to start selling beer too). Lorena was the best employee. She was so patient as we placed our order. Super friendly and helpful through out our visit. I like all of the different salsas. Vonda was also super friendly! They deserve a 5 star themselves! I had a salad w grilled talapia and it was great."}
{"text":"Don't take the welcome coupon . Wasted trip.  Fish taco was like eating a bag of old grease..disgusting.  threw it in trash.  Don't waste your time or money.  And btw overpriced for what it is.  Garbage."}
{"text":"Happy National Guacamole Day!

I'm a huge guac fan, so being that today really is National Guac Day, I knew I had to \"get me some.\" Despite a crazy work schedule and very limited time, I made it happen with a quick visit to Rubio's!

Sure, they are a chain, but I do love their fast casual style, friendly employees, salsa bar, and best of all, great selection and quality food considering the prices.  I got myself a salad with shrimp, a large guac and chips to share with the fam, and a kids meal for my son... 

Not only was the food delicious, but the kids meal is a great deal.  For under $5, the meal includes your choice of entree (chicken quesadilla was my choice today), your choice of side (from applesauce, chips, beans or rice), a churro, and a small drink.  

Everything was a hit at my house, and I won't hesitate to return to Rubio's sooner than later when I'm in the mood for a quick fix of Mexican!"}
{"text":"food is consistently good, although a little overpriced, but this is true for all Rubio's franchises. staff are friendly and food comes out fast which is good when you need a quick lunch bite. the only thing I don't like about Rubio's is that it always feel like the tables inside are sticky. drives me nuts!"}
{"text":"Just what I was craving. The salad and the fish taco were delicious. It's quiet and the service was great. The food I ordered was very fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Ah Rubios - you are the friend I met back in 1999.

The $6.00 burrito consists of one part tortilla, 8000 parts rice, and about 1/16 of an ounce of protein.  Sad panda.

One should \"hack\" the menu and order the burritos with the rice and black beans on the side.  This may inspire the burro maker to say \"whoa, this 12\" tortilla has about as much protein as a handful of peanuts.\"

Old school fish tacos are worth the trip - especially when paired with their hottest salsa."}
{"text":"I LOVE the California Bowl with Grilled Chicken and the Red Chipotle Salsa! Reminds me of Chipotle with a more authentic mexican taste! Healthy option and def worth trying! Also, Taco Tuesday they have a special on their fish tacos a la carte!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid lunch place for baja tacos.  They have a great salsa bar with a variety of flavors.  They are typically pretty quick with the food.  The tacos come with corn tortillas unless you ask for flour.  Don't forget the churro to round out your meal.  This is a great lunch place."}
{"text":"I am not big on chain Mexican food.  But Rubio's seems to have that taco stand taste and feel.  Food is fresh - I mean very fresh.  that's important if you are pimping fish tacos.  Not over salted or packed with preservatives.  Salsa bar is great.  When I eat here - I kind of get flashbacks for many Baja Surfing trips back in the day."}
{"text":"Janky!!! Order 2 shrimp tacos... might as well have ordered 2 cabbage tacos with a sprinkle of shrimp. Only 3 tiny pieces of shrimp (smaller than a quarter) but cost me $10. Won't be back gave one star for convenience of location ONLY"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chipotle orange salad with blackened tilapia and it was so good! You can't beat the quickness and freshness for the price. And the people who run it are so nice. Will definitely be adding this to my new favorite \"fast food\" rotation."}
{"text":"I usually go in to get a Health Mex Burrito with chicken to go. Love em. Great with a movie at home."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Rubio's location. Great food and always friendly service. I have been coming here for many years and have not once had a bad experience. My kids and I love the seafood options, and I appreciate that it is sustainably caught."}
{"text":"Excellent food at this place, everything tasted so fresh, salmon tacos were just perfect, excellent customer service. The General Manager, Carlos is  just an awesome guy!! Keep up the good food and service!! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"After seeing the prices at the Diablo Cantina $18 for a quesadilla is insane! We ate at Rubio's inside the food court. I thought it was delicious and had different Salsa choices. As far as the Monte Carlo is concerned, I'd recommend any of the places at the food court than any of their other restaurants that anchor the casino."}
{"text":"These are not the best fish tacos you will ever try, but they are good.

And of you go after 2:30 on Tuesdays, the fish tacos are $1.25 each - which pretty much makes them very good."}
{"text":"Food is always great service is always great except tonight. The cashier was so rude. I can't even believe it. She had the worst attitude didn't smile once was monotone just so unpleasant. Didn't even make eye contact. I'll be sure to eat at another Rubio's next time."}
{"text":"Ya know...for a fast food chain, this place has permalove written on it from me.

Maybe it's due to their fish tacos...and their loverly (yes, loverly!) shrimp burritos...or their refried peppery bean goodness.

I always have had consistently good food at Rubio's - no matter where I've been - Las Vegas, Mesa, Chandler, San Jose, etc. It's a chain, but mercifully it's no Long John Silver. Everytime I've eaten at Long John Silver, well...loosie pewps and we'll leave it at that.  TMI, sorry.

Hubby usually goes for the chopped chicken salad bowl, but I've noticed the size varies from place to place and state to state.

If I ever have a craving for a shrimp burrito I usually head on out to Rubio's - it's cheaper and far yummier than some of the sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"We are loyal Rubio's customers. I was extremely disappointed at my recent experience here. The fish taco that I ordered was doused in the sauce. I'm talking more sauce then fish.  With barely any cabbage on top. They also forgot to pack a lime with it, that is key. Our gourmet tacos had so much cheese grilled onto them that it was hard to pick it up. Honestly, the fish taco grossed me out so much, it will be a while before we return to Rubio's. It is extremely disappointing, to spend so much money and not get what you want."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!
One cashier called in sick, one of the cooks quit and the poor girl working the register was in tears because she had been working straight since 11am without a break and the owner & manager were no where to be found?!?! 
I will be writing the corporate office! The line was out the door and was only getting longer and the owner/mgmt team was no where to be found to help this poor girl. The new Cook couldn't even get a simple tacos order right and this poor girl was left alone to deal with all the upset & disappointed customers!! Where is the ownership and mgmt. when they knew an employee quit and one called in sick?!?!??!! I guess they don't care about their business of franchise!!!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap tacos! I had the Grilled Gourmet Taco with shrimp and the shrimp were big and delicious, plus bacon, avocado, and cheese. Fiancé had the Original Fish Taco. I also like all of the salsa options. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location twice a week for about four months now. The food is always fresh and delicious; the employees always kind, helpful, and efficient.

I love the fish tacos, add a squeeze of lime and WOW. Very yummy. The grilled salmon burrito is delicious, very big for the price. I have yet to be able to eat an entire one in one sitting. My boyfriend is a fan of the chipotle shrimp salad."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying no rubios will ever get 5 stars feom me. The prices are too high for the quality of food you get at all of them but this rubios in particular isnt so bad. Its pretty small on the inside but there are plenty of seats as the place is pretty dead even in the middle of the usual luch rush. The service is fast and accurate so thats good. The staff are all kind and respectful.  Im not crazy about rubios but if you are you'll probably be happy here."}
{"text":"Rubiooooos I love love Rubio's! The original menu items are so delicious like any of the fish tacos or the original shrimp burrito. But I believe they are franchised locations because the one on Lake Mead food is always cold, and the other two on the West summerlin area always seem to be closed or closed early. Which breaks my heart because we would definitely go more often. Hours need to be more consistent. Best one in town still is the one in Henderson. Other than that, place is delicious!"}
{"text":"The cashier Stephanie witch is one of the mangers  that took my order was amazing explained the menu the only issue i have is the othe other manager witch is the male was kinda of rude but other then that was good"}
{"text":"This is really good Mexican fast food. Focused on seafood, but they have some chicken and steak options. Ingredients actually do taste fresh and the tortillas are soft and yummy.

Really friendly staff (but a few mix ups with the order - they fixed them).

Mango ice tea is nice.

Overall: top tier Mexican Fast Food."}
{"text":"Wow!  Did you ever try their almost cold chicken enchiladas?   Is it something new?  JK kinda ... was really hungry so didn't make a fuss BUT should've ordered their fish tacos.  If i come back again, i'll make sure i'm not really really hungry & i'll have the fish tacos."}
{"text":"There's a lady named Mari who's too unfriendly for  customer service that has worked the past couple of times we have eaten here."}
{"text":"Everything was hot, fresh and great service. Even on a busy Sat. night !"}
{"text":"I have a habit of finding a food location, eating everything on the menu everyday for over a month, then getting sick of it all, and that is yet to happen here! First off I love fish, and fish is their speciality, so the relationship is now mutual. Getting a delicious Ono Burrito after a hard workout at the gym is a great pick me up. They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito. If you want some shrimp, give the Mesquite shrimp burrito a go. This location is next to Whole foods on lake mead off the 95 exit.

Oh, comes stocked with a salsa bar as well. Grab a churro and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am in Love with their Original Fish Taco!  the service is Always friendly and attentive. Kudos to their fry cook, they fry and sauce those tacos with love, lol."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's.  We just discovered it a couple months ago, and it is much tastier than other similar food joints.  My favorite right now is the shrimp burrito, and I love the chipotle salsa."}
{"text":"Perfection. Exactly what I wanted and expected frim years ago. Very Happy!  I got the fish taco plate to go. Fish was amazing cabbage was crisp and fresh. It was hot and ready for me to taje. I love their salsa bar! My fav is the green.
Ps... I checked in and got $2 off my order.
 Thx guys!"}
{"text":"This was so horrible, I'll never go here again. I must have gotten the kids steak Street taco. They were so small 3 bites and they were gone and the filling was maybe a tablespoon of meat. I asked if their bean burros were just beans and white cheese. NOT, lied to....they were yellow cheese and had red sauce in it and I'm allergic to the red sauce! 2 steak tacos and 2 bean burros....that was $16.xx. That's ridiculous. I went to the one in Glendale AZ at Loop 101 and 59th Avenue and they're bean burros were larger and were beans and white cheese ONLY! What gives?"}
{"text":"I have an enjoyable meal here. I went with the 3 street taco meal. The meal includes 3 tacos with your choice of chicken or steak. Plus beans and chips. I went with the steak and extra beans to add to my tacos. The steak was tasty and I received a good portion of meat. While this is a fast food Mexican style of food it's still enjoyable to eat. 

Service was very nice and quick.  I enjoyed the salsa bar with the different salsa options. I appreciate that they are labeled and it looks good and presentable. Who wants a dirty salsa bar. There are also limes available to squeeze onto your meat. 

There are many options to choose from at Rubio's. Plus they offer a kids menu. 

Heads up ladies the firemen like to come to here to eat  so you can also enjoy the eye candy while you eat some  food."}
{"text":"I can't complain about Rubio's it's the best in fact I am in Texas right now with no Rubio's around me and I am suffering because I want to eat my vegetarian bowl or my shrimp burrito and there is no we're out here that even comes close!"}
{"text":"This Rubios is awesome, well actually they are all great Conley helped us today and she was super professional. Can't wait to enjoy yet another yummy Rubios experience!"}
{"text":"Classic shrimp burrito, good as always! Yummy!! I used the check in deal and they accepted it every time. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can find a higher quality quick service chain restaurant in the US.

Rubios consistently provides a fresh, flavorful product and the service is always top notch. My go-to is the grilled gourmet steak taco plate which comes with rice, chips and tacos are filled with a layer of grilled cheese, avocado, bacon, cilantro, onion, steak, and a chile lime sauce that's phenomenal.

My wife rotates between a couple different salads and a few different shrimp tacos and enjoys them all.

On top of this, there's a fresh Salsa bar and they have great mango iced tea. I may eat at Rubio's more than any other place in the area. I'm definitely a regular.

Also, their Manager Lorena is fantastic."}
{"text":"The mall in Chandler has a pretty decent food court, but I just wanted something small and simple before heading to the airport, so I went with a single shrimp taco from Rubio's. Taco took an absurdly long time to come out (I was the only person waiting on food), but the buzzer buzzed several minutes later and I collected my taco. It was delicious!

Salsa bar was clean and chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"Got the quinoa & cilantro & chicken special, & happily got way more food than i expected, & it was very fresh-made.   Thanks to the cook! Plus their iced tea is yummy, too."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Ash Wednesday and was please to see that the cashier was not startled by my ashes.  (It happens).  I was very pleased to see so many other ash bearing families there too.  I had California bowl with blackened talapia. It was awesome with just the right amount of kick without any salsa.  My husband had the original fish tacos with everything on the side as he is such a picky eater.  The kitchen obliged and the meal was perfect for him too.  We've been back another time for the same meal and were very satisfied.  And even though the Sangria is bottled, it was very delicious!"}
{"text":"In one word why I would come back to this Rubio's again and again; service. I had an old gift card that it sat in my car through an Arizona summer and I had all sorts of stuff melted to the magnetic strip. So I couldn't check it easily to see if there was any money on it. And the assistant manager took 10 minutes and made phone calls to see if there was a balance on there. You just don't see that kind of service anymore. Beyond her amazing above and beyondservice. They deliver the food to your table. The place is clean. The restrooms are clean. Everyone smiling.

They have moved into seafood more in recent years.  The salmon tacos that were black and were tasty. I've always like the mahi-mahi burrito. Next time I come back I'm gonna try the lobster tacos or the lobster burritos. They have three different types of fresh brewed iced tea. It's real food that tastes great and is nutritious so I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"How does this place have a 4-star rating? 

I came here late one night since I was staying at the Monte Carlo and wanted a quick meal before returning to my room. I ordered the fish taco combo and was disapointed to find that the fish in the fish tacos were nothing but fried batter. After I peeled off all the batter, a chicken-nugget sized piece of fish remained. Not filling at all. Also, what comes in this \"combo\" you ask? Stale tortilla chips and a small ladle of refried beans.

Next time I'll be heading over to McDonalds for a Big Mac instead."}
{"text":"Rubio's has the best fish burritos I've ever had. Their salads and tacos are great as well. My boyfriend and I like the shrimp & bacon and the beer batter fish burritos best so we usually order one of each and trade halves."}
{"text":"I was trying to convince my husband how good Rubio's is (my usual location is in Buckeye off of Estrella), and this place made him question my love for Rubios. The lettuce was old and the blackened mahi was almost burned it was so blackened."}
{"text":"I love this location. I've been to the one off of Bell, and was definitely disappointed. Here it is always fresh and delicious, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"First time going here and very impressed with their selection and service. My family and I enjoyed everything we ordered. Original fish taco plate and the Especial. Kids meal cheese quesadilla with chirp and rice. Blackened Mahi Mahi Burrito was probably the best out of all we ordered. Definitely will go back when we're looking for a quick, inexpensive meal. Oh and the restaurant cleanliness was impressive."}
{"text":"An employee tried to fight me over an argument. They accidentally gave me beef instead of shrimp and i asked for them to replace it and they didn't. I asked to speak to a manager and then the employee told me to go \"go fuck yourself you dirty little Jew bag\" and yelled at me to leave. I am Jewish and i was wearing a silver star of David necklace and i feel truly offended i would rather eat out of a dumpster than go back there"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 15 years since it opened @ least 2 a month.

I love the Friendly Service laid back atmosphere and the food Rocks especially if you're into FRESH.

The Limited menu is always DELICIOUS with the latest Catch of the Day 

Check them out"}
{"text":"Saved my breakfast.  Kind of pricey, but tasty.  Ordered an egg, cheese and bean burrito.  Poured on some of their salsa and went to town.  Located in the Monte Carlo food court."}
{"text":"I come to this location when I'm visiting my daughters. The staff is very friendly. The food is always fast and fresh. The location is convenient and there is plenty of parking. Perhaps because they are busy, the dining area is frequently pretty messy (though not dirty)."}
{"text":"Don't worry about saving time and calling in an order... Ordered at 11 and its now 11:36 and still waiting... I don't get this type of service in tucson"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Very. 
We have been coming here for years. It's always been good. But today was just ridiculous. 
I ordered the Balsamic and roasted veggie salad with chicken and my husband got the Baja burrito. 
The food was brought out and the chips that came with the burrito were horrible. They were stale and hard to chew. The burrito was fine. 
The salad on the other hand was missing half of the listed ingredients on the menu. There wasn't any peppers, onions, zucchini and avocado. My husband brought it back up to the front and told the girl. She was trying to argue with him saying \"you got the balsamic salad with chicken.\" Yes, we did. The only balsamic salad is the roasted veggie one. She took the salad and had the chefs add the roasted veggies. When she brought it back out IT STILL WASN'T RIGHT! Still missing avocado. Not worth the argument but we will now not be back."}
{"text":"#TacoTuesday!!!

love the fish tacos

salmon burrito is great
don't like their guack"}
{"text":"I come here for their fish tacos and/or other seafood tacos once a week. The quality is always good. The staff is polite. You can ask for larger containers when you want to take your salsa to go. Consistent quality and service keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This place twice has messed up my food.  This time around all the toppings where thrown in one corner and there was barely any salsa or beans.  Skip this place nothing was spread around just slopped in"}
{"text":"She was a past lover. I used to visit every Tuesday.. I decided to check on her. She's changed; charged me extra this time. A whole quarter more for her \"fish taco.\" I told her: three, flour; chipotle and white sauce on the side, PLUS cilantro, AND Guac n chips. She complied, as I slipped the payment for the goods. I prepared the routine strategy. Handful of limes and four stacks of roasted chipotle sauce. No lemons. I waited for her arrival. The surprise lime embedded in every taco.. old moves, trying to play on my memories. She was different now, she changed. Yet, I still loved her. Not a bite wasted. It was done. I told myself I wasn't coming back next time; that it wasn't the same anymore. She smiled, she knew I would return, & at that very moment, I also knew."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. We usually order out twice a month. I go for different variations of the fish tacos. I usually go for the whole meal. The Original Fish Taco is my favorite but the Coastal Trio rocks my world.

My gal usually orders the Balsamic and Roasted Veggie salad. Dressing on the side with double the veggies.

The word that comes to mind in communicating the goodness of their menu is freshness."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Rubios in a really long time and was very happy with my experience here. The restaurant is very clean and the food is very good. I loved the fish taco but my favorite was the shrimp taco. the shrimp has a grilled flavor to it and the sauce is so good and creamy. For fast Mexican food you can't beat it. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!

The salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).

My husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well."}
{"text":"Went here last week for dinner. We frequent the 44th and Indian School location and have been to another location in the west Valley. LOVE their food. 

But this location was probably one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been to or I can remember going to. Trash everywhere, spilled food all over the floors, dirty tables...I'm honestly not very picky and understand being busy, messy customers, etc. 

But I was preoccupied with thinking about how dirty everything else might have been the whole time I was eating. 

There were two or three other people in there, so it wasn't like they were swamped. 

Food wasn't great either. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Been going to Rubios since they first appeared in the valley! This location is especially consistent in quality food and service.  Love the fish tacos and their selection has really grown!  Yummy."}
{"text":"I meant to take photos of our beautifully prepared orders of the lobster enchiladas with red sauce, steak taco, and shrimp tacos.  However due to how insanely delicious it looked we devoured it in seconds.  The staff are super sweet, clean and organized salsa bar, the food is superb! If you're looking for fresh tasting seafood/ mexican food go here!"}
{"text":"This is the Mahi Mahi bowl!!!! Simply scrumptious! I would leave out the lettuce next time, personally- iceberg & not great tasting. The fish is superb!!!! Yum!

Great price!"}
{"text":"Rubios  is truly yummy.. If you order the right thing

Positives:
I've always liked this place. I like that I can order something healthy and enjoy my food. I tend to be a fish taco kinda girl and theirs are great. They have a salsa bar that is nice. If you don't want something healthy.. It's even better. Haha. 

My husband got the Mahi Mahi burrito that was wonderful!! I got the salmon tacos which were okay.  I probably wouldn't order them again? But they were healthy. 

Negatives:
I wouldn't say this is a cheap place for the in and out type of place it is.  It's not horrible either.  

I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"So, Rubio's was a chain restaurant - which I was surprised to see. I had never heard of it before. But I really enjoyed my fish tacos! My kids got nachos with only cheese (rolling eyes) and they loved them but of course I thought they were quite bland. I commend the lady taking our order as we had a million questions about the menu and she was very patient :)"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try with 3.5 stars considering that was the best option I had. First of all, they have no idea what Gluten is...being a national chain in Las Vegas(all types of people coming & going). So after I painstakingly worked through that discussion with the manager I placed my order, they called it surf & turf but it was really just a couple of lackluster, soggy tacos. They had way too much sauce on both tacos and overall just not very good. The reason for the 1* is that they served me cold retried beans with my crappy tacos. I would just dodge this food court all together."}
{"text":"This place has the best gourmet shrimp, bacon & avocado tacos!!! YUM"}
{"text":"We got the Burrito Especial and fish tacos. The food and service was pretty good. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The Ancho citrus grilled shrimp burrito was excellent.  Service was fast and friendly.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp tacos----was really good.  Will come back again.  The California bowl is good too."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Rubio's in over a year, so I decided to stop in for lunch... I now see why I haven't been there in over a year. I walked in, to \"not\" be greeted by the 2 stone faced staffers, just staring at me very uncomfortably. All the dialogue I received was the total, and I asked if he'd tried the new lobster tacos he just says \"yea\". Really??? I won't be going back there anytime soon. Very unpleasant people working. However the Lobster tacos were just okay, but there fish tacos are still amazing!"}
{"text":"I tried to post for this store last month. But, for some reason, I couldn't find it. Now, that I have, I added that review for this store.

Whenever I go to a Rubios, I always have the Fish Taco and chips. While the chips were good and the lime and salsa are always fresh (so far), my fish taco was barely warm and the fish not very crunchy (I give this store 2 stars). Seems to me it had been sitting out too long.

However, my mom's taco was soggy and the fish limp; a HUGE disappointment (she gives 1 star). But, liked the chips, lime and salsa, so manages 2 stars.

Perhaps, it was the time of day? But, like other chains, it may also be the store specifically.

Doubtful that I will return to this one."}
{"text":"I've been to this Rubios 3 times and had the Fish Tacos and chips every time. The first time was GREAT, 2nd time was Very Good and 3rd time was GREAT. The chips are crisp and the salsa and lime is fresh. 

The Fish Tacos on the 1st and 3rd visits were hot and crunchy. On the 2nd visit, the Fish Taco was warm and a bit soft. But, still very good.  

I think its best to get the tacos just as the fish comes out of the fryer."}
{"text":"Love it!
The two taco plates with refried beans and chips are amazing. I've tried fish tacos, shrimp tacos, beef tacos and they are all good! 
My only complaint is regarding the shrimp and lobster burrito - it gave me stomach ache. Could have been a bad coincidence but I won't order this again :("}
{"text":"I like Rubios, just find it a little pricey for what you get. But do love me some fish tacos Tuesday night. Sasla's are all good too."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and I must say was very happy with it. The service was very good and friendly staff. Fresh food!   I got the Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi taco plate and had it blackened. First it looked fantastic and when I took my first bite I was in love. The flavor was lipsmacking good and had just the right amount of punch. If you like some heat this gives it to you. Awesome job Rubio's!"}
{"text":"My partner and I are currently here visiting from California for business and we decided to go casual last night and get Rubios. We phoned in our order at 9:00pm and they close at 9:30pm. As a service industry working I understand how rude this is to do (for those of you who do not know... extremely rude). Crystal answered our phone and she was extremely accommodating and answered question we had about the menu thoroughly, accurately, and kindly. She was patient with our long and difficult order, and repeated it back to us.  
We arrived at the location around 9:20pm and Crystal was behind the counter and greeted us with a smile right when we walked in the door. We exchanged payment for food (which she already had boxed up ready to go) and we were on our way. 
Great customer service. 
Amazing food. 
Clean store. 
Happy faces. 

Maybe I am writing this because most Rubios locations I have been to have never really been that great. However Crystal and the grill cook really made our night. Thanks so much for creating a more positive image for Rubios because the food is great."}
{"text":"Very healthy ingredients I really recommend ordering the salads if you on low carb diet"}
{"text":"Just had another fish taco platter and this place makes me happy. The manager running the register made it a fun atmosphere,  even though the place was packed. The whole family loves it here. It would only be better at the beach."}
{"text":"We're here about once a month and have been happy each time. Salsas are fresh and bright, the mains are prepared with care."}
{"text":"what's to say, fresh fish tacos, great sides, citrusy & bright for the hot day, perfect."}
{"text":"I think Rubio's is my least favorite of the quick-service Mexican restaurants. I want to like it, but somehow the flavors just aren't my bag. They do have fish and shrimp here, but again, not really my bag. 

On the day in question I had a salad. It left a little something to be desired--though it was fresh. They make it seem like you're getting buckets full of avocado, and then you get three teeeeeny little slices. 

I will say that the service at this place is stellar. Everybody was so friendly, even brought me my food when I cold have gotten up and got it for myself. If I liked the flavors more, I would definitely be giving them more business based on service alone!"}
{"text":"Like this Rubio's, it's kind of on a lake/man made pond so the view when eating outside is nice. 

Love their steak and fish taco meals. They have a salsa bar too, which is a plus in my book! Service was really fast for my to go order and the lady even brought it to me without calling my number."}
{"text":"The food is good, but unfortunately they have new people working the register that aren't as good - in fact, rather lazy. On 8/22, the girl at the register went and sat in the back of the kitchen rather than tend to customers out front. When our order came out, an item was missing. We figured no big deal, maybe she is new. On 8/29, we called our order in at 5:50pm to pick up. When we got there it was busy. After several people came in after us and got their orders before us, we asked about our order. Except for two items that had been made (which were ultimately cold), the rest hadn't been made - she hadn't followed up on our order and couldn't have cared less that it hadn't been made. We asked to speak to the manager who wasn't there. The other girl wrote a message, but of course I doubt the manager ever saw it. So, forty minutes later we got our food and left and I doubt we'll return unless they can muster up some better customer service."}
{"text":"I like Rubio's in general, but service at this location is exceptional. Been her several times and they ALWAYS get my order right, and that's not easy considering I have 4 very picky kids."}
{"text":"We used 2 coupons and just paid separately. I had the Ancho Shrimp burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. It was decent; I don't think I've ever had a BAD meal at Rubio's, however this burrito could have used a bit more rice. It was tasty though and had a decent amount of shrimp placed throughout the burrito, which probably accounts for the $7.79 price tag. Definitely tasted better with a $1 off coupon I received via email. My son had the Burrito Especial w/chicken, gave it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Tried something different for my second go around at Rubio's and was much happier with this order than the Coastal.  The Coastal Trio is NOT a bad way to go, so don't get me wrong - if you like seafood and tacos, it's a great option. This time I was feeling more filling and less toppings and wrap so I opted for a burrito instead.

I had the Burrito Especiala with the grilled chicken and black beans, and it was delicious. There was more than enough filling to be a full and satisfying meal, while not being so much that it broke open the burrito and was a complete mess.  He had the two taco plate and ordered one steak and one chicken.  Both came out as chicken, which wasn't a huge deal since it was good! 

We sat on the porch to enjoy the wonderful weather outside and it was nice for people watching, too, so bonus! Desert Ridge has plenty of shops and restaurants to try out, making it a great night out for just about anyone.

Overall: A-
We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Made a quick lunch trip to this location.  Had the Coastal Trio, which was very good.  The atmosphere has a beach vibe and was very clean and organized.  I probably will try another meal when I go back, not because the Coastal Trio was bad, but I would love to try a more traditional style taco from there in place of the seafood ones.  

Overall: A-  
Will definitely return and try new things at this place!"}
{"text":"It's been over 2 yrs since my original review, time to update it....this place has been a solid, consistent restaurant since I moved to town a few yrs ago.  

They should be recognized for their consistent delivery of good food and solid service.  Their employees are always friendly and welcoming.

It can get busy here for lunch and on the weekends....the one knock on it is the small parking lot area...it can get full fast.

I'm addicted to their Steak Burritos....especially when I top it with Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.

{"text":"After a subpar Rubio's experience at another location last week, I decided to give this location a try because I was craving Mexican food for lunch.  I ordered:

Chicken Street Taco, $1.89

The food came out in a short period of time and despite being busy, the cashier remembered who I was and took the food out to my table instead of calling my name....great service!

The Chicken Taco was very good.  The Steak Burrito Especial was even better.  The Steak was juicy and full of flavor.  All of the ingredients were fresh and complimented each other.  Of course, I got the spiciest Salsa from the Salsa Bar to eat with the food.  I love their Salsa Bar.

Overall, a pretty good experience.

{"text":"I haven't been to Rubio's in years and I was craving crispy fish tacos. Lucky for me, there is a Rubio's close to me so hubby and I decided to head over half an hour before they close. 

I ordered the two tacos especial plate, which comes with chips and beans. I didn't care too much for the beans and chips and salsa, but the fish tacos were sooooo good!!! I forgot how good they are. 

I also ordered a churro and that thing was delicious too!! It had so much cinnamon on it, which I liked and the inside was so soft. It was a really great churro. 

I will definitely be a returning client especially on Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to a Rubio's....this one is in my neighborhood.  My 1st experience with Rubio's was great and I was hoping this one would be good too.  I was right!

I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans ($6.29).  It came out shortly and I went to the Salsa Bar to get their Spicy Salsa....it has some pretty good heat and I enjoy the flavor a lot.  The Burrito was very good and satisfying.

I'm glad I found this chain and that there's one near my house!

{"text":"Oddly enough, this was my first time eating at a Rubio's.  I was in the area and decided to give it a try.  After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to go for the Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans instead of Black Beans ($6.29) and a Carnitas Taco ($1.69).

While I was waiting for my meal, I went to the Salsa Bar and filled up 4 cups of their spiciest Salsa.  The food came out relatively fast.  I decided to go for the Carnitas Taco first......it kind of like the \"Street Tacos\" found in Mexico.....Corn Tortilla, Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Lime Juice.  I poured some Salsa on it and took a bite.....it was pretty good, but not great.  It's very small and in my opinion not worth $1.69.

Next, I went for the Steak Burrito which came with a side of Chips.....bonus!  I took one bite of the Burrito and became a fan.  The Steak reminds me of the Carne Asada I had in So Cal growing up.  The flavor of the Burrito hit home for me.  The Salsa was pretty spicy too, so that was awesome!  The Chips weren't that good though.....good thing I didn't pay extra for that.

Overall, it was a good dining experience.  Glad I found a new quick Mexican joint.

{"text":"I'm typically a fan of Rubio's.  I've been to many of their locations.  However, this one disappointed.  I ordered:

Steak Burrito Especial, $6.99

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA#4KJ_NtL5G2EXKqIca2zehA

The food came out in a short time.  While I was waiting, I went to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of their spicy Salsa.  The first item I ate was the Steak Street Taco....the meat was dry and Guacamole was bland.  I poured a lot of the Salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture.  Very disappointing.

Next, I had the Burrito.  That was dry too!  Even with the Sour Cream in the Burrito, it was dry...the Steak, Rice, Beans...all was dry.  Needless to say, I used a heavy dose of Salso on that as well.  To make it worse, the Chips that came with the Burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale...so they were chewy...that means they combined new, fresh Chips with a batch of old ones....bummer.

One positive thing is that the service here was outstanding.  The cashier was very friendly and had a nice, welcoming smile.  I also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine....the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one.

I'll have to come back and give this place another try, it may have been an off day for them.

{"text":"Not great food. A lot of breading on the fish. Cold fish tacos. Not much flavor. Yucky yucky. Black beans were bland. And lime rice was not edible."}
{"text":"Older woman took my order. She was kind, but seemed new or just not too knowledgeable about the menu over all. I ordered the classic beef taco plate. I did ask \"Does the guacamole have onions in it?\" The woman said \"No it does not\" and so I would assume the order taker would say \"No that does not, but this other ingredient does has onions\" and even though this was the case, the order taker did not mention the onions. 

Leaving the counter, another order taker/server/ possibly a trainer loudly tells the cooks \"I'm aggravated,\" followed by a hush by the older woman. This set a weird mood in the entire small food area. Even if it wasn't about the customers that this girl is aggravated about, she made it seem to be so.

I received my order- and of course to my dismay there was onions in the tacos. I took the plate back, and the cooks looked at me like I was dead meat. 
Minutes later one of the younger looking cooks with a giant soul patch came out to me where I was sitting, holding my plate that was returned... unfixed and said \"Did you ask for no salsa Fresca?\" I said \"I didn't want onions\", which he replied with \"But did you say 'No salsa fresca?\" And so I said \"No, I didn't want onions. \" 
-First time at Rubios btw-
The kid walked away saying \"Okay next time just say 'No salsa fresca.\"

-uh, k.
I am not the menu creator, so if I don't know onions are in the salsa fresca, how in the hell would I know to say that?? Also, why is \"I don't want onions\" so difficult to comprehend? 
I received my order, and the amount of wilted lettuce on the tacos I had to remove was incred. Bravo  I never knew this could be done. 
To the cook with the soul patch who said \"Next time, say  'No salsa fresca.\" - I will not be back to this forsaken place to have to order -properly- or mention that I do not want salsa fresca. First and last visit to Rubios. Please hire new staff."}

{"text":"LOVE their nachos with chicken and no salsa... I get it every time now. They have a wide selection of food and they have a salsa bar so you can add your favorite kids.

{"text":"Sometimes it's really hard to do Mexican food fast, fresh, and tasty. I wish I could at least say that they've got the fast part down, but that isn't the case.

I have ordered Mahi Mahi tacos and chicken tacos.  They are so damn addicting and the mazza they use on there tortillas is incredibly good!  I am real fond of the special sauce on the chicken tacos.

Once again Rubios is fantastic!  My call ahead order was ready and beautifully prepared and packaged up.  The food (taco bar) is nothing short of mouth watering and flavorful!  I try to focus on eating healthier and they fulfill it with optional tortillas (flour and corn).   I highly recommend Rubios for hot and fresh amazingly great food.  Eddie - thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"This truncated review is based on free fish taco promotion that they have, I guess annually, at this chain. One time was all I needed to stain my amygdala with the horror that is the experience of a fish taco at Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill. 

We went at nighttime. Not sure if this mattered; and it might have been for ANY tacos, but all they had left was fish. I cannot remember; it was maybe two years ago. I figured this place - the location -  if not the entire chain would be CLOSED due to insolvency by now, it was that terrible. 

So we had fish tacos. My girlfriend had one and I had one. I don't remember there being that many people there; it was weeknight. We were going to the Regal right next door afterwards to catch some forgettable picture. 

The fish taco was the worst fish taco I have ever had. In fact, I have never had another fish taco since then, now that I think of it. My organism as a whole said NO MORE FISH TACOS, GUY after the experience. 

I will never patronise Rubio's again, but I hope to someday, with lots of therapy, be able to overcome my fear of fish tacos and have another one (somewhere far far away). - E"}
{"text":"Ordered online and it was ready super fast! It was even peak dinner time. Very friendly too! Food is delish!"}
{"text":"The Overpriced and Bland Burrito that I had would keep me from returning to Rubio's."}

{"text":"Had their crispy shrimp burrito that they had on special for a limited time...ooh man...it was heaven!! However, the meal was almost $10...ouch!!! I had a coupon for up to $10 in free food, so it didn't hurt this time : )"}

{"text":"For what you get, this is pretty tasty. 

Rubios is the same around the country EXCEPT CALIFORNIA. 

I was unaware of this, but you can't get beer in Rubios in Henderson. 

Regardless, get an fried fish, avocado taco. 

If you don't, I will hunt you down, come up behind you, and then politely ask you why not."}
{"text":"This Rubio's in Mesa Riverview is clean and friendly. The salsa bar was clean and refreshed often. I was disappointed to find that Rubio's is not yet on the online ordering bandwagon. I'm not a fan of waiting around and taking up a dining room seat. But I will say that my order was prepared and ready with lightening speed!

The seasonal langostino burrito is always awesome, and the tomatillo salsa rivals my own (gratuitous booster). The chips and refried beans are ridiculously good.  The fish tacos, citrus shrimp burrito and street tacos are excellent. Even a plain salad is good, and they will accommodate your diet; in my case adding bay shrimp and salsa only to a plain salad. Everything has been fantastic. 

This franchise is a good one in the chain, and I appreciate their wonderful customer service."}

I can't exactly give a food court points for atmosphere or anything, but they gave me yummy tacos, and caffeine, and I was grateful."}

{"text":"I came here many years ago after we first moved to Las Vegas and I was disappointed with the menu.  I expected more dinner food and less tacos so I had not been back.

In the month of July, people were given coupons for donating blood at United Blood Services for a free Rubio's taco.  I took the coupon but I wasn't sure I'd use it.  After a late afternoon ending of a movie at Village Square, I decided to give Rubio's a try.  I( got two original fish tacos and I was surprised that they bring the food to your table when it's ready.

While waiting, I got some iced tea and I waited for the tacos.  They came separately.  For the first one, I used the lime with it and it was very good.  The fried fish was hot, the cabbage topping was nice and crispy, and it was OK.  I tried the second taco without the lime and it just misses too much without that citrus.

Service was pleasant and prompt."}
{"text":"I was shocked. I was on my way to the movies and had some time to kill so I said to myself, \"Frank, you look hungry, why not get something to eat,\" to which I responded, \"yes I am and I think I'll have a taco at Rubios.\" What a mistake.

My journey began with the group of 3, who you could tell were just feasting on chips and salsa. There meal was followed by an employee giving his friends burritos and a session of \"high 5.\" Got to get that reassurance from the friends. Then 1 pulls out a cigarette, placed it on his lips. A gentleman with his son told the gut not to be a jerk, he laughed and pulled out a lighter to light the cigarette. That's the \"oh, he'll no,\" come out of these lips of mine. 

What more needs to said. Rubios lost a customer. And by the way, I don't understand how the management let a group of kids alone to close. By the way, I didn't see any guacamole on my tacos and the employee said it's there and had to look for it. Wtf? I did find the guacamole, it was covered by a lot of lettuce and the food was subpar. Enough said"}
{"text":"My Husband and  I go to Rubio's often, he loves there fish tacos, and I love there salads, we usually visit the one on 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright,  but, sometimes go to this location, since my Mom lives near this location, she also loves there Fish Tacos !,   there was a young girl that was so sweet, and thoughtful, that she made my day, never have had this customer service from Rubio's before, I ordered to go, she offered a cup, so I could get water, while I waited, and also offered me larger container's for Salsa, she could probably see it in my eye, that I like it Hot ! was so impressed with her !"}
{"text":"We began going to Rubio's 7 years ago when we first moved to the west side and loved their food then.

They've recently changed the menu and I must say, although we don't go that often anymore we love sitting outside when the weather's nice and enjoy our food. I usually have their salad bowl and it's plenty of food (I share with my 3 year old daughter). 

Their food's good, it's prepared when ordered and they give little kids a little bag with crayons for them to stay busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on a whim to check out Rubio's. I had a burrito and she had a salad. The total came out to 16 dollars which I thought was really high but I figured they must give you a lot of delicious food. In short, the burrito was not very large and I still felt hungry afterwards. The food was pretty good but it wasn't 16 dollars worth of deliciousness. My wife also thought the salad was ok but not amazing. They do seem to put a lot of effort into atmosphere and decorations, so maybe the inflated prices are to pay for the decorations."}
{"text":"I got the chopped salad and the original taco . It was yummy ! Lots of flavors ! The people that work there are always friendly ! Wonderful chipotle salsa !"}
{"text":"For many years, I was resistant to the idea of fish tacos. Little did I know what I was missing! 8 years ago, I decided to try them at Rubio's and I've never looked back! On this particular visit, I redeemed my free birthday meal, which is a perk of signing up for their email notifications. Consistently good food every time I visit!"}
{"text":"Those who place an order for \"Dine In\" should always been given a number. Always. Having to stand for a long period of time when you came to relax and enjoy yourself is not a good thing. The table was also dirty. If you're looking for a good Rubios, try the one on Raintree!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you guys, but it has been one heckuva work week.  Ughhh.  I opted to splurge after work and enjoy dinner at Rubio's.  I've been here a couple of times before, but never took it upon myself to write a review... 'til now (and I didn't forget the pics before I scarfed down my food this time either.  WIN/WIN!)

So... Rubio's is a great, chill spot with good food.  They seem to specialize in a tex-mex / mexican / seafood kinda flair.  The bulk of their mainstay seems to incorporate seafood into the dish in one way or another.  This location is very clean, the employees are friendly and the food... well, like I said, the food is good.

I opted for the Cabo Plate which is a good choice if you've come hungry.  The plate consists of their classic grilled shrimp burrito and their original fish taco.  The burrito has grilled shrimp, refried beans and a host of other goodies.  The shrimp is grilled to perfection every time and the beans are not too overdone.  I typically smother the burrito in their roasted pichante salsa which has more flavors going on in my mouth than I really know what to do with... it's delicious.  Not a lot of spice, but still a ton of flavor.  The meal itself really isn't horrible for you and goodness knows there's worse things you could be eating.  The plate isn't finished though.  You also get a side of their famous no-fried pinto beans and a large handful of their tortilla chips which seem to round out the entire plate without pushing you over the edge into a food coma.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.  Their pinto beans are creamy and the texture is excellent.  

This is definitely one of my favorite weekend lunch spots and I'd recommend it to any of my friends and family!  Kudos to everyone at this Rubio's location for a job well done."}
{"text":"3 Stars is about right on the money for Rubio's.  Used to be better in my opinion when Fish Taco Tuesday was only $1 per taco.  I could feed my family like kings!  Now that they are $1.50 each we haven't been back really since.  Economy = SUCKS.

Whenever we end up at Red Rock Casino for date night the wifey and I often end up with a snack or a meal here.  It's probably one of the cheaper places in their food court to get a bite.  As much as I love Capriotti's and some Panda Express, sometimes a guy needs to watch his waistline.  Rubio's fits the bill nicely.  Get a healthy meal with some grilled fish, chicken, or steak, colorful veggies, and a wicked salsa bar.

The wifey likes her fish tacos, but sometimes will opt for the Pacific Mahi Mahi Burrito.  Mild fish, grilled with seasonings or blackened with spices, wrapped in a whole grain tortilla with fire-roasted corn, guacamole, Mexican rice, cilantro, onion, red and green cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce.  Actually pretty good eats, very flavorful and definitely health-conscious.

I stick with the Burrito Especial with either steak or chicken.  Marinated meat, grilled, wrapped with guacamole, salsa fresca, sour cream, black beans, Mexican rice, and creamy chipotle sauce.  I usually add lettuce to mine and opt for a whole grain tortilla.  Not authentic Mexican, I know, but darn tasty!  

Each burrito or meal plate usually comes with a side of tortilla chips, perfect for taking advantage of Rubio's salsa bar!  Their signature salsas are all stellar.  I always take more than the usual amount of little plastic containers!  They usually have four salsas on the bar:

-Mild
-Tomatillo
-Roasted Chipotle
-Picante

Sometimes I guess depending on season one of the salsas will change.  Once they had a mango salsa, and another time they had a pineapple salsa.  My faves to go with are the tomatillo, and the roasted chipotle.  Complements any of their dishes great.  Also on the salsa bar is cilantro/onion mix, pickled jalapenos, limes, and lemons.  If you're a cheapie, just get yourself a serving of beans and rice, and top it off with everything from the salsa bar!  I've seen it done, and NO, it wasn't me.

Beware though, since this Rubio's is in a casino food court, prices can be a tad bit higher than one in your local neighborhood.  But it's still not too bad.  Our burritos came up to around $8-$9 each with chips and salsa bar included.  Not bad for a date night.

Get in, watch a movie, eat, then go ahead and lose the rest of your money to bingo or video poker!  I prefer CRAPS."}
{"text":"Cafeteria like food. Inside is outdated and furniture worn out. Dirty old plates and bathroom in need of cleaning. Customer service from employees great but I expect chicken in the chicken burrito. Come on Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Had a steak burrito and the girlfriend was advised by the irl at the counter to get a salmon burrito and we both really enjoyed our meals.  Plus, the staff was pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but I have to give this location 2 stars because of some service issues.  I ordered a veggie burrito, only to find chunks of chicken in it halfway through eating.  Upon alerting the staff, someone in the kitchen said to me \"oh yeah I accidentally put chicken in it, so I just picked it out.  It was an accident\".  Everyone that works here seems to be in middle school, so I guess that explains the casual attitude.  Regardless, that's a totally unacceptable food handling habit, especially considering this place sells shellfish.  I am a vegetarian, so I was a little grossed out, but I glad that I don't have a serious food allergy.  The bathrooms are also consistently dirty. We'll be finding a different location to try out."}
{"text":"Ehhh... not bad but I didn't love it either.  I think I'd rather go to chipotle next time."}
{"text":"I give them a 4 star rating because I get what I expect. I always order the burritos with no rice. To me that's just filler and carbs I don't need. I really like the blackened Mahi Mahi. Service is okay sometimes they can be slow, however every time I'm here they are extremely polite. I'd recommend this choice over Johnny Rockets and the other choices inside the casino....

And by some extra chips and sit and people watch! It can be quite entertaining...."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. The tacos hardly have any meat in them and they were cold!"}
{"text":"Rubios is a great way to beat the heat and enjoy a nice refreshing salad which is amazing.. I always get the chipotle ranch salad and it is exquisite  You can't go wrong with anything you get because it all is amazing!"}
{"text":"Lunched there yesterday and am going back today for lunch. There arent any Rubio's in the part of the country where I live and knowing that I travel, a couple friends have been recommending Rubio's to me. It was worth it. The portions were on the small side though..."}
{"text":"The staff members are so friendly and courteous. The food is always delicious and fresh. I wish they were open later than 9 on week nights!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this location, major sewage issues.  Had to hold my breath to use the restroom, so disgusting!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here once a week for about two years- it's a lunchtime staple. It gets very busy at lunch, so I always call ahead. I live nearby so I can usually get away with calling, immediately leaving, and arriving at Rubio's just in time for my food to come out. 

I like the bowls the best, and I love the liberal amount of guacamole that comes in them! I also eat the salads, and if it's Tuesday, i'm eating fish tacos ($1.25). I'm not sure I'll ever get sick of the food here. I like their black beans, especially if I dip tortilla chips into them. I tried the gourmet tacos recently and they were tasty, but I crave my usual orders! 

The only problem I ever have is calling in my order sometimes. Once I was hung up on (although pretty sure it was accidental...CRASH...*click*...*ambient restaurant bustling noise*....*silence*). A few other times i've had to hold for enough time I felt like it would've been quicker to go over and stand in line. I assume they don't get enough regular phone-in orders to have anyone dedicated to it, and the guy at the cash register just can't constantly be on the phone and help customers in line. The prices have also gone up a little over the last couple of years, but the food quality has remained high so I won't argue. Look forward to eating there again next week!"}
{"text":"Trio, original fish taco and loaded nachos. Nachos could of used liquid cheese other then that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Although I am not always in the mood for Rubio's fish tacos when my wife wants them, but I always realize she was right on the first bite."}
{"text":"Ok, I see Rubios, Baja Fresh, Café De Rio, Robertos, and Chipotle all as competitors.  Rubios is tops of all of them and I'm not even a fish taco fan (which is their claim to fame).  The grilled gourmet tacos are fantastic.  I enjoy the grilled chicken and the shrimp tacos personally, but they have a broad menu with many choices and tasty salsas at the salsa bar.  For about the same price range of all of those listed, I think Rubios is the value for your money."}
{"text":"Rubio's currently has the Coastal Trio which includes the shrimp, fish, and tilapia tacos.  I recommend it to try all three taco types at once, very yummy!  For $8.49 it can be beat if you like seafood tacos."}
{"text":"I love this location! I've never had anything here that I didn't like. Their salsa bar is amazing. About 3-4 different salsas and peppers to choose from-unlimited! My favorite is the red mild. I also like that there are soda machines and you are allowed free refills. That's always a win in my book! 

The employees here have always been so great. The turnover is high, but whoever is doing the hiring is doing a great job. The service is fairly quick for something being made right on spot. I've even ordered to go and have had good luck there too!! 

As for the food, my favorite is their nachos. I usually get them without meat because I'm boring haha but they are such delicious smothered nachos! My mom LOOOOVES their fish tacos-and I've heard other people talk about how good they are too. If I really want to treat myself, I end the meal with a churro. One of the few places you can get one in the valley and they are YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Just walked in at 8:59 not knowing when the restaurant closed. The front door was unlocked and there were still people eating inside. The woman at the front nicely greeted us and got ready to take our order. Some jerk behind the back that was cooking popped his head out and said \"sorry we're closed\". I laughed thinking he was joking, but he looked seriously at me and said \"we're seriously closed\". To the nice woman at the front, thanks for being kind and treating us with respect. To the guy behind the registers, you're the reason that we will never ever spend money here. 1. Lock your doors if you're closed. 2. Don't be a jerk."}
{"text":"I don't come here very often, but I have to admit the couple times I have, I'm impressed. 

I like their new langostine(mini-lobster) tacos and their grilled fish taco. I've tried their fried fish taco but it's oily and grossly battered. 

Service is so-so as one time the counter folk are very customer service oriented but the other time, the guy was oblivious."}
{"text":"This place never fails when it comes to their signature fish tacos, always on point and always delcious!"}
{"text":"Good food but super dirty tables. The wood tables are sticky like they haven't been cleaned for years. Staff are happy and kind but the ownership needs to fix the dirtiness."}
{"text":"I used to live on the west coast before moving to Chicago and definitely missed the Rubio's classic fish taco.  When I was in Vegas last week, I found out there was Rubio's in the Monte Carlo and made it a destination for dinner.  Crazy, I know, but I really wanted a fish taco.  Anyway, everything was \"off\" about my taco.  The batter was literally an inch thick. I can't even figure of the physics of how that much breading and batter can stick onto the small fish filet without falling off.  Also, the oil tasted old - it had a bad aftertaste.  They did get an extra star for the kid's meal though.  We ordered the quesadilla meal for my DS and he really liked it.  It also comes with 2 sides - we asked for one of the sides to be chips...but we got a churro instead.  It was a disappointing experience overall.  Very sad we wasted valuable eating time here instead of the many other great places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"The only decent place to eat in the Monte Carlo food court. They offer a wide range of healthy options. 

I ordered the California salad. It was loaded with orange slices and avocado.

I would suggest this spot for a quick dish. The line is a bit long. However once you order your food, the wait is less than 15 minutes. And the plus side, the food is super fresh."}
{"text":"Super friendly, courteous, and excellent service. Serg and the other young woman who works here are great and checked up on us"}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars because there's always room for improvement...

I love Rubio's as a concept. I eat here quite often. The fresh seafood tacos and burritos... This is the way Mexican food should be.

I also love the fresh salsa bar... However I do wish they had more options. It is a bit limited for salsa bar.

I didn't have any issues with the food today... Just that the server did not pay attention to my request when I ordered. I didn't want the fried fish. Only the fresh grill and blackened. But I still ended up with the fried fish in one of my tacos.

I brought it to her attention... And the manager quickly corrected it."}
{"text":"Pretty darn tasty tacos....
I like that the tortilla is fried on one side so the inside has a light crispy butter covering.... Fattening but a yummy added element to your taco experience.
The creamy sauce they put on the shrimp taco is Yummers and the steak is soft and tender. I really liked the shrimp and steak tacos!!!
The chips & beans are pretty standard.
There is a salsa bar but none of the salsa's are really outstanding to me...
The food however was yummy...."}
{"text":"Food is great but the restaurant is pretty dirty in the seating area. Peeling wallpaper dirty baseboards food on floor etc. Staff is nice. Men's room is pretty bad, dirty grout broken tiles dirty floor smells like urine. I am visiting Mesa so maybe that is the standard here but it could be improved a lot. Dirty restrooms seem like it may be an indicator of other problems. But food is great.
Update: came back again the next day. Salsa bar us awesome. Highly recommended. I hope they can clean up a bit."}
{"text":"another place i hit up at the monte carlo for a snack. fish tacos are yummy here, must try! not sure if it's all rubios, but they dont give you tortilla chips unless if you pay extra."}
{"text":"The dining experience is more than I'd expect from a place like this. It's like I'm dinning at a 5 star restaurant-- I'm exaggerating, of course--with people coming over and asking how my food is, asking if I need anything else, taking away my plates. Can I give you a tip for god sakes? 

I'm always impressed when people learn my name and that definitely earns points from me. Right now, I'm obsessed with their pan seared salsa verde shrimp tacos.  You gotta try them! I have horrible cravings for those bad boys.

They also make sure you keep coming back.  One time, they messed up my order and because of it, they gave me a card that entitled me to one free taco for my inconvenience.  I wasn't even mad or upset about it, but I wasn't gunna pass up a free taco either."}
{"text":"I have just recently discovered Rubio's and my belly is happy for it! Here's why: 

1.The food is tasty and high quality. 

2. Huge selection of food, so everyone in your party will be happy for sure.

3. The prices are reasonable for what you receive.

4. The staff is extremely friendly.

5. Salsa bar!  The salsas are all yummy and you can have as much as you like.  

What's not to like? If you like Mexican food and want to try something new, check out Rubio's!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the atmosphere and menu that Rubio's offers.  The location in Surprise shut down so we will drive to this location when it makes sense.  Great tacos and the beans have been of the thicker consistency which I think is good."}
{"text":"My grilled steak burrito was okay, but either their black beans have too much liquid (well, that is true), or the whole wheat tortillas aren't absorbent enough, but what a runny mess.
I don't think I'm in any hurry to go back, though I'm always pumped to find spicy pickled carrots on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Fast very friendly service. Especially love the fish taco's. Taco Tuesday is the best."}
{"text":"Stopped for quick food on the way to the Hoover Dam from LV.  

It's new and very clean inside.  

Got the Big Burrito Especial.  For $8.41 I got a soda and big burrito that was excellent.  The regular salsa was good, especially with a bunch of the chopped onion/cilantro mixed in.

Sadly I checked the website when I got back to VA today and the closest location is 1,725 miles away in Aurora, CO.  Luckily I found out that I can save 3 hours by taking I-64W from Lexington, VA instead of just I-81."}
{"text":"I was in the mall today running some errands and decided to give Rubio's a try. It was just okay. I had the grilled chicken soft taco with chipolte cream sauce and avocado and it was pretty good. The flavor of the chicken was just so so but the chipolte cream added to the flavor quite a bit. They do have a salsa bar at this location in the mall but it is not the greatest. The mild is a bit watery and has way to much cilantro and the picante is way to peppery. The only salsa I really enjoyed was the chipolte salsa which really complemented the grilled chicken taco.

I might try Rubio's again if the mood struck me but it is not somewhere that I would seek out specifically. Not that there are many other great options in the Chandler Mall food court. It's just okay."}
{"text":"Since my daughters are frightened by the recent Chipotle illness outbreaks in the news, we decided to try Rubios. 
We were pleasantly surprised when we left. The service was very friendly, food was good, price comparable to Chipotle. Bye Chipotle. 
For now."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite of the breakout of \"fresh-mex\" type places.   This place is very similar in layout to a Baja Fresh, except they haven't sold their soul to Wendy's like Baja Fresh did.  

The quality of food here is really good.   I especially enjoy the carne asade tacos with a little salsa verde on it.   Thinking about it makes me want to go get some right now, except that it's about 930, and they're likely closed.  I never get the guac, but I've been told it's very fresh and very good."}
{"text":"The manager Linda is awful, but everyone else is great.  Especially Daniel.  He's awesome.  The food is good but the place is often dirty."}
{"text":"Rubio's is pretty consistent at any location. What I like about this particular location is the friendliness of the people working behind the counter. Consistent good service with a smile."}
{"text":"I came to Rubio's Aliante location for the first time and I like what they had to offer.

I came with a friend who ordered for me + another person the grilled gourmet taco that came with a side of refried beans and rice and it was stupendous! 

The whole meal was super tasty and fresh and everything was just super delicious!
3 orders of the gourmet chicken combo came to about $31, which is a fair price in my opinion.

The service was just what you'd expect from any fast chain. It was simple, fast and efficient and were in and out in about 7 minutes.

Next time I'm in the area I'll give this this Rubio's another go!

Thanks Rubio's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Rubio's in California and Las Vegas, but this Rubio's is by far the best I've ever tried.

I came in yesterday and ordered 3 street chicken tacos and 1 salmon taco with no sauce and I don't think I've ever had such fresh tacos. I mean it was literally mind blowing that a \"fast food\" joint can meet the standards of fresh. 

The chicken and the salmon was so tender it was freaking amazing. I'm not sure if this Rubio's always delivers fresh tender meats on a regular basis or if this was just a fluke, but I'm definitely coming back.

I like this particular Rubio's the best not only, because the food was so delicious, but because the staff here is very friendly and seem to enjoy what they do here.

I'm definitely coming back real soon!"}
{"text":"I am not normally a pain-in-the-ass orderer, only at Rubio's. Because they have lots of things that I like but not all in the same burrito. So I order one burrito and make about 22 changes to it. 
This Rubio's got it right. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And didn't give me an attitude when they did it, either! 
I love them."}
{"text":"They should have an ad in the paper food employees that should say, \"must have teeth.\" Seriously, if you're going to run the registers, wear your dentures!! And the food sucked! I couldn't get a good meal to save my life that day. Geez!"}
{"text":"I  went here for the first time today.  Since I am pregnant and it was my first time eating here I had all kinds of questions.  Delorean helped me figure out what fish was in the fish tacos, how big the fish taco portions were, and such.  He was extremely patient with me and super sweet!  He treated everyone that nicely- I saw that as I was eating my lunch alone and observing what was going on.  I ordered the two fish taco platter.  The fish tacos came with two lime slices (the limes were super fresh and not disgusting or old by the way,) a side of pinto bean stuff, and some chips.  The chips were okay but I loved the tomatillo sauce I got from the salsa bar.  I didn't care for the pinto bean mash either; I took two bites and was done.  I did house the fish tacos fairly quickly though- I loved them!  I mean for $10 (with my Honest Tea drink) that isn't a bad deal and it was pretty good for fast food.  I will definitely be back and I hope Delorean gets credit from his bosses for being a very good employee."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites. Have not been since we moved 10 miles away. Brought visitors here and the Staff is very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. The food is always great."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! 
I was not sure what to expect when we stopped by for $2 Fish Taco Especial last Tuesday. The Original is only $1.75 after 2:30pm.

I had seen on the Yelp app that you can call ahead and place your order. Well, not realizing the time necessary for these wonderful fish tacos to be ready, we just stopped in and placed our order at the register to go. 

The young woman at the register was very pleasant, and made sure that we knew that with the Fish Taco Especial, you get the addition of homemade guacamole, a cheese blend and a mix of cilantro and onion. And a lime wedge! Yes, that is definitely what we wanted. We decided to get 4 since they were such a good price. No way can I eat two of these, but I could always have one for lunch the next day.

We waited for nearly 15 minutes, but when it was our turn we stepped up to the counter and the same young woman who took our order opened up our to-go box and presented us with a view of these tacos. They looked fabulous! Seriously. These were a step above just any fish tacos for sure! I really liked how she showed us the tacos before bagging them up. We were excited to get home and try them. We made sure to get some salsa from the salsa bar and put it in their containers with lids to go. Convenient. 

When we did get home, we realized just how large each piece of fish on these tacos really was. One was PLENTY for me. I am not a big eater, and I was stuffed. 

We plan on trying these out again, but calling our order in this time so we can just stop in and take home our tasty food. There is no drive-thru, but this food is made fresh for each order. Well worth any wait. The parking lot is in the northwest the corner of Eastern and Serene, and is not crazy busy over there. Fresh food, great experience."}
{"text":"Ok, I'd stayed away from this Rubio's for a while after a string of bad experiences. But lately I thought I'd give it another chance. The good news is the food quality seems to have improved. Yea! Bumped up from 1 to 3 stars.

The bad news, the service is still really spotty. Tonight, for instance, my to-go order was for a burrito \"enchilada style with green sauce\" - buy it came with red sauce. And I asked for black beans on the side instead of chips. I got the beans, AND the chips! People, this isn't all that hard to get the order right!"}
{"text":"We like Rubios every time my cousin comes into town. But this location always smells like raw sewage inside. It is disgusting. Nobody wants to eat at a place that smells like that. It is an on again off again situation. You never know if the smell is going to be there or not when you walk in."}
{"text":"Only reason for my two star review was my dry ass steak in my street tacos. Everything else is amazing! Even the atmosphere. Clean friendly.. Just dry streak-_-"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch about once a week. The food is great, but the reason I come back is the people. They are always fast and helpful. Many place in the area have dumb worthless employees (Einstein's Bagels). I recommend the fish burrito!"}
{"text":"I love the greeting I get at Rubio's. My order is always correct and tastes great. The manager on during the day shift is pleasant and knows my name now. Love the chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Dear Fellow Taco Fanatics (and representatives of Rubio's):

I am a long-time vegetarian and have spent a lot of time and money going to Rubio's over the years. I'm also the girl that rants and raves about Rubio's and their perfect chips, amazing mango habanera sauce, and juicy limes. I absolutely adore that you responsibly source your fish, and that's just the best thing about you guys. Thank you. Here's where I have my beef (vegetarian pun included).

The Portobello Pablano taco (a.k.a. tastiest vegetarian treat ever) is GONE!  I went to visit the Rubio's in Scottsdale, Arizona. This particular Rubio's has the best people, wonderful management, and as I've mentioned already, very juicy limes. They literally sold me the last Portobello Pablano taco that they could make, since it was coming off of the menu. Talk about heart breaking.

I was wondering if we could maybe delve into why such a decision was made, as there are seemingly very little options for vegetarian food in the \"Taco\" sector of the food industry. Don't break my heart, Rubio's!

Sincerely, 

A Vegetarian Taco Lover 
(Don't read into that...)"}
{"text":"Mango Habanero tacos. Amazing. The employees here saw that we were hungry, and they were slammed. I was so elated when they swung by and gave my boyfriend and I a total of 4 free meal coupons out of a thank you. A little patience goes a long way, and so does gratitude for your customers. Best Rubio's ever! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about... I have had bad luck at this place every time. Never going back... if you have a cheese allergy, beware! They will put it on your food whether you like it or not. Their salmon comes in a hard stick form, and they give you two shrimp in a 3 dollar taco covered in mass amounts of crap.  I actually went back because they gave me a free burrito from screwing up my order before. Then they gave me another bad order. Skip the free burrito and head to Baja Fresh for a way better meal."}
{"text":"I was visiting South Mountain C.C. and on my way 2 the bus stop decided 2 stop in and grab a bite to eat. . .I ordered the two shrimp tacos combo. . .The reciept didnt show a drink listed with the combo so I didnt ask. . I paid nearly $9 . So I took the meal to go as I didn't wanna miss my bus.  .When I opened my food box. . .I ate the shrimp tacos, the shrimp looked a lil weird, almost purple-ish, but still tasted good. . the amount of rice given was like a lil spoon full, it was almost insulting. . . they didnt put the rice in a container like they did the beans, but it looked like the amount of rice given wouldnt have filled the same container. I will never visit Rubios again. I could get way more food for $9 at Panda or Subway."}
{"text":"I was recently invited by Rubios to celebrate the return of their delicious enchilada's; wow! Thank you for bringing them back. The sauce is what got me hooked. Tip: get a side of the red enchilada sauce to enjoy it with your chips.... Yum!"}
{"text":"Alot of you might be wondering why i would write a review on a fst food chain like Rubios. Well if you have had Rubios Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos you know why I am writing this review. If you haven't had the Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos then hold on to your tate buds because these bad boys are as good as they get. The Gourmet Steak is BY FAR the best taco, of any kind, that I have ever had. I'm not even going to get into everything that is in it, but when they ask you if you want the bacon in it say YES. This will be a taco that you crave, but beware at 340 calories per tacos if you eat to many you might pack on the pounds.

Let me know if you think these Gourmet Tacos are as good as I say they are."}
{"text":"Tiny little cafe, I'd say in the middle of a casino resort. It carries some tasty fish tacos. In fact, it is a place that is well-known for fish tacos in perhaps one part of Las Vegas, as far as I know. It is located in a food court and perhaps competing with other existing food brands. Surely, fish is fish, perhaps to me, there is no close substitution to fish, especially tacos with fish. So, if you are craving fish tacos, especially in Nevada, go to Rubio's. I'd say, Rubio's is the Taco Bell of fish tacos but slightly better."}
{"text":"Went for the first time not long ago, which is crazy because I'm obsessed with fish tacos. One of my good friends always talks them up but I just never got around to going. Grilled fish taco was great as was the orange shrimp salad. Quick for take out, reasonably priced, good service. I liked the little salsa bar too always a plus. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly and quick to clean up the tables and I have never had a problem with quality at this location"}
{"text":"Rubio's has great tacos and soup!  I like the gourmet grilled chicken tacos.  The soup is very yummy too!  I like their special onTuesdays. The staff seems nice.  I give them only a 4 star because of their small portions and higher prices."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a quick bomb shrimp burrito. They have a combo platter that beyond fills me up, with a burrito stuffed with shrimp, a fish taco that is actually quite flavorful and beans and chips. You can call in your order and pick it up which is a nice option. Decent salsa bar that's free"}
{"text":"I had the grilled veggie tacos. Pretty good. I'd have liked more veggies in the tacos. Mexican rice was your standard red-tinted rice, and the black beans were your standard non-special, non-offensive black beans. I liked the medium and roasted-tomato salsa. Good place but tight on seating and expensive for fast casual: 2 grilled-veggie tacos, 1/4 cup black beans and Mexican rice, medium drink, no add-ons, $12. Yikes!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's food but I'm  extremely disappointed with this location and will not be returning. The last two visits I was given the wrong order. I ordered a grilled bacon and shrimp burrito...I'm not sure what burrito I was actually served. My burrito was a size I get from Chipotle and it was all rice. The establishment is run by young high school kids I feel they are not paying attention to reading the correct orders or serving quality food. Definitely needs better management."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Rubio's Fish Tacos with flour tortilla of course. I don't think I have had fish tacos anywhere else that was so yummy! The fish is always crispy and tender in the middle and the cabbage isn't overbearing and overstuffed. I also love the fact that Rubio's has a salsa bar that you can pick different salsas out. When I'm feeling for something a  lil healthier this is the place that I go to....although I'm not sure how deep fried anything is healthier."}
{"text":"I just ate the most delicious rice bowl I've ever had. The cilantro lime sauce was out of this world, and the mahi mahi was cooked perfectly. I love the salsa bar with fresh lemons and limes."}
{"text":"I know I know, it's a chain restaurant. BUT, for those of you who love chipotle and haven't tried this place out, you should give it a try. 

The burrito especial is my go to, with grilled chicken. Their burritos are very neat and delicious, so you likely won't end up with your entire burrito falling in half. Also they have this jalapeño citrus hot sauce in a bottle that is soooo good all over the burrito."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Rubios for about 16 years and it's still our favorite place to go! Best fish tacos and bean and cheese burritos, actually all the food is good!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great service. So friendly. Amazing food. They did mess my food up recently, I called and the manager said she was so sorry and took my name down and said she would take care of me next time. Next time I are my whole meal was free. 

Awesome place."}
{"text":"Travis helped us and was extremely helpful and patient as we've never been her and the menu was a bit confusing.  He helped us with items on the menu and had a great way of explaining the items and had his recommendations which we are glad that we took.  Food is delicious, customer service is great... Not much more one could ask for."}
{"text":"Love their Fish tacos especial and the new poke bowl.
I don't like the spanish rice, but the white rice was ono.
Service is always friendly and fast for this fast food chain."}
{"text":"Kind of shocked at my recent Rubio's experience. Shortage on staff led to many things wrong with the place.  For one, the place was filthy.  Dirty tables, dirty floor, messy drink station; it was foul. Secondly, our food took forever.  I'd understand if the place was packed, but there was only one order ahead of mine.  Then, when my burro finally did come, it was just sitting there on the plate by itself; no chips, no garnish.  Just the burro!  I bit into it & the tortilla was hard and almost cold.  I have never had a \"hard\" burro in my life, and I'm hoping never to have one again; it's not a good thing. Needless to say, I left the restaurant feeling totally unfulfilled and yet quite happy that places like chipotle and cafe rio are nearby."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had!!!  Anytime I get a craving for fish tacos, this is the only place that I will go.  The wife and I ate here before heading out of town. 

The original fish taco is awesome.  The fish is fresh and the batter is so good, not to mention the great salsa, white sauce, and cabbage.  You just can't beat it.  You can also get a fish taco especial which has avocado added to the original.  It was also good, my wife's favorite. 

We also ordered a couple shrimp tacos.  My wife ordered one with salsa verde and avocado.  The shrimp was fresh and flavor was good.  I ordered the one with bacon and red sauce, delicious. 

Going back soon."}
{"text":"November Seasonal item: Langostino Lobster burrito

This was the primary reason for our lunch visit last weekend. It came with chips. You order at the counter and pay for it. Someone will bring it to your table. We also got a kids meal for our picky-eater son.

The layout is an L-shape. Counter is to the right side, when you enter. There is a salsa bar to the left. There were four or five choices (mild, medium, and spicy), as well as sliced limes. To the left of the salsa bar are the fountain drinks (including two choices for iced tea). The bathrooms are to the back of the property. It is clean, both the general seating area and the bathrooms.

Mine was good, hubby's was lopsided (ie. missing the langostino) so he kindly brought it up to the manager's attention, which was handled pretty well. I do remember that the one we had in the past was more hearty with langostino, is my only criticism. Otherwise, the ingredients were a nice compliment to each other, and nothing was overpowering, as I had it as it came (hubby usually omits a few things); I thought the salsas were creamy and flavorful. I could've finished it, but I saved the rest of it to enjoy later. Hubby thought the replacement burrito was better, as the langostino was more evenly distributed. The chips were fresh, crispy and went well with the chosen salsas. 

Our son loved his cheese quesadilla, which came with chips, a churro and a small drink @ $4.79. We are trying to expand his food choices, so it's nice when he was something sort of new (it's been a while). (He likes Chipotle, Roberto's & El Pollo Loco.) He didn't finish it though, we took it home. 

Would I get this again? There are other choices on the menu (might try the other langostino ones, enchilladas, tacos). My favorite thing to get here is the fried fish tacos. Hmm, decisions, decisions."}
{"text":"As a true San Diegan, I can tell you that the closest you'll get to a real fish taco outside of San Diego and Baja is Rubios.  Real fish tacos are deep fried, not grilled.  Real fish tacos use corn tortillas.  Real fish tacos use cabbage, not lettuce.  The only reason its not a 5 is due to price, and the fact that this location does not have alcohol (Pacifico goes great with fish tacos)"}
{"text":"So many good things on the menu
Try the bean & cheese burrito  w/ rice  and cooked extra time!  It's the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's \"authentic\" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.

The food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist. 

I have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.

My husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.

Their salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.

Portion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...

Service at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.  

They also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.

Give Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you."}
{"text":"Free birthday meal!? HECK YES!

Sooo on your bday they email you a 7 coupon for your bday, as long as you sign up for the email club prior. Now Ive been to Rubios in San Jose and really liked it! My son enjoys their classic fish tacos, and on Tuesday after 230 you can get them for 1.25 each! DEAL!! I on the other hand do not like fish, but do like shrimp, Im a weirdo lol. Anywho we ventured here after school a few days before my bday (they send the email on the first of the month) 

I scanned the menu for chicken and shrimp options, and asked the cashier what she recommends, her answer were the street tacos. Now I wanted to get more bang for my freebucks so I ordered the chicken burrito sans tomatoes. My son chose 2 fish tacos so my total was only 3!! SCORE!! We went to the salsa bar and got some hot salsa and FRESH cut limes!! FRESHHHHH! We always opt for water bc soda is the devil, I went ahead and squirted (dirty!) a lime into my water and enjoyed how yummy it was! 

We only had a short wait and our food was BROUGHT OUT to us! WHOA! I couldve walked my little fat ace up there and when I seen him I stood up and he said no and walked it to us. Talk about hospitality! I cased my burrito and noticed it needed to be mixed up and needed more crema. I was a little afraid to ask, but he gave me a generous helping of it. YUM! So I put my crema and salsa and salted that bad boy. Now typically I do not like beans in burritos, unless theyre from Chipotle. Here the burritos taste like a more Mexican chipotle and most def make you feel fuller. The burritos are long and medium, not short and fat like Chipotle. 

We both bit into our yummies and honestly I wasnt crazy about the burrito... it was kinda a fail : ( It honestly had no seasoning and was pretty bland even after all the stuff I added. I even added lime to give it a light taste, but negative! Also the tortilla dried out pretty fast bc the AC was on in there so my burrito pretty much stooped over and died mid meal. Thank goodness they give you chips otherwise Id be eating it with a fork. My son only ate 1 taco bc they also got a little soggy... we are the weirdos who take like an hour to eat, but since the ac was kickin it kinda died up our tortillas. No biggie! Cant be all grim over almost free food!!

Now I give this place 4 stars bc of the customer service, as mentioned above both the cashier and food runner were very courteous. Also, my son was wandering and seen a beach ball so I asked if they sold them and the cashier gave him a FREE RUBIOS BEACHBALL! How nice right?!

All in all we'll go back to try the other yummies!!"}
{"text":"Rice was over cooked, inconsistent cut sized with the lettuce pieces. We also ordered fish tacos one had one whole piece and the other had little bits of pieces and bland. Chips were also bland."}
{"text":"A tasteful , satisfying place for sure:) 
My favorites are California bowl with your choice of fish... Blackened tilapia is a must try 
I never get bored of Rubio's eatery :)"}
{"text":"The best Lobster burrito!! So fresh and staff was excellent!! Steak tacos are very good to highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!  Employee preparing food picks up broom, briefly sweeps while wearing gloves, then begins preparing food again with same gloves. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Love coming to This location. BEST OF THE BEST 

Always clean and fresh and I love how nice the employees are. 1 complain is that sometimes on tacos Tuesday's it gets busy or during the soccer season but no one can help that it's normal"}
{"text":"Hmmm.... maybe the food prep is better than the Rubios near my home? Maybe because they have a few unsweetened fruit flavored ice teas? Maybe because they sent me a coupon for my birthday as an email member? Whatever the reason, I suprisingly really enjoyed my lunch here. Staff was super nice. Lots of options for healthy choices. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered catering for 25+ people multiple times from Stapley location - fresh, hot, and my order is always complete! I can't complain about any Rubios, but this location in particular has excellent service and food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and friendly staff. My wife, daughter and I stopped in while doing some shopping in Desert Ridge Mall. The gentleman (manager) taking our oder was extremely helpful, and gave a recommendation for the Shrimp burrito. IT WAS FANTASTIC. So good, we came back a week later. We love the salsa bar, the food is fresh, and all around a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This is more expensive than Chipotle or Qdoba, and worse quality and quantity in my opinion. 
I usually order the H Mex burrito which is a \"healthier\" alternative, but every time it's mix of about 50% rice, 35% beans, and 15% chicken. This meal is completely unbalanced and has way too many carbohydrates. 
The quality of the tortillas is horrible, and the chips and salsa are below average as well. 
I only go here because of its convenient location."}
{"text":"I had chicken street tacos and chips with pintos. It was ok but nothing to brag about. The food is decent but the 5 stars is for service.  Casey is super friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. The blinds were open and hurting a kids eyes and she lowered the blinds for the family."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Rubio's a bunch of times and each time I enjoyed my meal I ordered... Friendly staff and the restaurant is always clean. I have ordered the World Famous Fish Taco 2 Taco Plate (Crispy beer-battered fish, shredded cabbage, mild salsa and tangy white sauce) and the Fish Taco Especial 2 Taco Plate (Fish Taco with fresh guacamole, jack and cheddar cheese and cilantro and onions... Each comes with chips you get a choice of beans or rice as well I get the black beans they are really good. Plus they have a really good salsa bar to spice up your meal... For a really fast and great meal this is a must stop lunch spot."}
{"text":"very nice and clean location. I always order whatever they have for a limited time and this time was the panko crusted shrimp tacos. very good"}
{"text":"They NEVER answer their phones for take out. Messed up my order two times in a row. I recommend taking your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"If i could give a zero star to this location i would. Ordered some steak quesadilla and there is a long piece of hair caked in it! Was told by the manager when i called that i should be getting a full refund within 2-3 days. It will be a week on Monday and still NOTHING. I should be getting some type of email regarding it but NONE. Horrible service! Pic of grossness down below"}
{"text":"Change your times, 20 min drive to come here Yelp said it closes at 1am got here at 11 pm  and the girl said they were closing very frustrating"}
{"text":"Why haven't I ever eaten here before?  I kept asking myself this question after we popped in for a quick lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The food was fast and fresh made, and we actually ordered seafood.  I normally wouldn't order fish at a fast food restaurant, but everything looked so fresh and fabulous, we couldn't resist.  We were not disappointed.  It was all of the above, fresh, fast, tasty & fabulous!  We also tried the chicken tacos, with the same approval.  The prices are great and parking is free.  If you are looking for fast, fresh tacos, Rubio's should be your first stop!"}
{"text":"Food is always great at any Rubio's I've been to! This location seemed pretty clean and well kept as well. The only thing to have made it better would be the staff; though no one was rude or anything, there could have been more smiles going around! When a restaurant has awesome staff, it really is the cherry on top for me."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for something fast but not crazy unhealthy, I love to grab something from Rubio's. It satisfies my Mexican food craving, without being too greasy (a.k.a the guilt).  My favorites are the California Bowl (all the deliciousness from inside the burrito but without the tortilla) and the Gourmet Tacos (all meat options have bacon in them....need I say more?).  Plus, the salsa bar is always stocked and the place is always clean.

Rubio's is definitely fast food done right!"}
{"text":"Goof tasting food.  Good prices and a friendly staff.  My wife and I shared  the Mahi Tacos and Veggie Burrito.  Very tasty with great sauces to top off whatever you have."}
{"text":"This is a nice place if you are not in a hurry. Especially do not show up within an hour of closing. Employees were complained by and served all food in Togo containers."}
{"text":"Here we have a fast food-ish joint. Everything is made fresh and to order. They have a good email program, I get coupons all the time. Also I  have gotten a free taco for donating blood. Not a bad deal. Well worth a pop in for a quick meal. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I love Rubio's! I could eat the chipotle ranch chicken salad every day! We go here at least every couple of weeks. I always say I'm going to try something different, but nope, I always go back to my favorite. The price is good and the salad is a great size. My husband loves their tacos and burritos. My son absolutely loves the bean and cheese burrito. I've heard great things about the street tacos too!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food reasonable prices the best choice in the food court as far as I'm concerned. Whatever you do avoid the Chinese place right next to it.  The Chinese place next to it  sucked a LOT."}
{"text":"I loved the Chipotle Ranch blackened Salmon! I could eat another one right now.. Very tasty, fast, and fresh meal! The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. I live their fresh salsa bar as well. They have the friendliest manager, Steve!"}
{"text":"I've visited a couple of times over the years, but my last visit confirmed that I really enjoy this fast food spot.

Love the menu options and that there are specials too. I've had enchiladas and tacos and enjoyed both. I'm always a fan of salsa bars and picking different flavors to try. The salsas I've tried have all been good. I love that calories are posted on the menu to make it easy to make healthy choices.

Employees have always been friendly and quick to the counter to take our order. On my most recent visit the employee had no trouble applying the Yelp check in offer. I was surprised to see that the chain does offer a Yelp checkin offer."}
{"text":"forget Mesa grill or even Javiers in the aria, you want a killer fish taco this is the stop for you! delicious and quick... and go for a late night snack and watch the side show of human mistakes roll through.... drunken party girls, crews of dudes with facial/neck tattoos and mid west double wides hitting four fast food joints before the battery packs on their rascals give out.... god bless vegas,,,,"}
{"text":"Hand-battered fish tacos (or in burrito form) with chipotle sauce. Churro for dessert. I don't think I really need to explain any further... :)"}
{"text":"Rubio's is my favorite fast food restaurant chain. The good is consistent between every restaurant I've been too.

This location is clean and bright; the general manager is always friendly and personable. The other employees are also very friendly and helpful. I always like coming to this rubio's"}
{"text":"Rubio's had been one of my favorite go to restaurants for fish tacos since college. The quality and consistency is always very good throughout all Rubio's I've been to, and this one is no exception. I love the mild salsa. It is pretty much addicting."}
{"text":"I love rubios. Very fresh, good quality food. Their steak street tacos are my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"For a chain place, they are pretty decently good I must say.  But the reason for the 5 stars (which I don't give out easily) is more for the service.  I am constantly blown away by how good the cashiers are here.  Excellent Customer Service.  That's a lot coming from me since I used to work for a company where we were known for our outstanding customer service.  My expectations are high."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to have my rotations at the same plaza as Rubio's every Tuesday, because after a day of interning, what sounds better than Tacos on a Tuesday?

I'm really impressed with this location.  On Tuesdays, they offer $1.75 Fish Tacos and $2 Especial Fish Tacos. Whats the 25 cent difference? More sauce, creamy white sauce/guac.  Definitely spend the extra money and get the especial fish tacos, it makes a difference.  

I ordered 6 tacos to go and asked if I can order 1 more to eat in the restaurant since I was starving and couldn't wait til I got home.  The cashier was very accommodating and went above and beyond with my order.  She gave me a bag as I was filling up my salsa cups and brought my taco over to me and told me that they would cook the rest of my order when I'm done eating so they would still be fresh and crispy when I took them home.  How sweet is that?!  I've never been treated so nicely, especially at a fast food chain restaurant."}
{"text":"@Rubios_BeachMex  at Red Rock Casino #Vegas

I'm always up for some Mexican Fast Food at the food court and Rubios' in one of the better choices. Located right near the Movie theater,arcade,Kids Quest and Bowling Alley its a great option to take the kids before a night out at the Resort.

Their Fish Tacos are the BOMB but this time We choose to share some of their nachos with NO meat but fully loaded with all the good stuff. $4.99 Cheap Eats Alert!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE @Rubios_BeachMex . REAL grilled steak tacos and 4 great salsa to choose from.

This visit I was redeeming my Birthday Email for a $7 Entree!!

I ordered the 2 Steak Taco plate with Chips & Beans!

Fantastic. Friendly Service.  I had intended to take it to go but it smelled so good I had to tear into it right away.

I would have given 5 stars except the nearest location is in BFE:(

Don;t forget to sign up for the Beach Club to get YOUR Free Stuff!:-)"}
{"text":"Our party of five went there tonight, April 21, 2015 for the sole purpose of fish taco Tuesday. They told us they were all out of fish tacos. We asked if they would substitute anything else in their place. They said yes but \"we can only have one taco.\" 

We weren't upset that they ran out of fish tacos, but rather the way they unprofessionally handled it. We were disappointed, and really unimpressed with their poor customer service. We will never go back to that location again. I would advise you to do the same"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have never been to a Rubios that has not had amazing service and excellent food and today was very much the same.  Rubios I always leave with a smile on my face thank you!  Shrimp Taco special is awesome!"}
{"text":"Just waited over 30 minutes. Asked for a refund and the girl behind the counter had the nerve to answer a phone order instead of completing the transaction with me. Never going back."}
{"text":"I wish this was closer to me. I'd eat there once a week if I could.
Obviously the fish tacos are the BEST and the Gourmet Steak taco with bacon is addicting.
The staff is always super nice, another manager, who has been there forever - you can tell he loves his job and Rubios!"}
{"text":"The experience was a good one.  It was a busy afternoon at Rubio's and we had a BIG order for 5 girls who were getting ready for a wedding. I stood in a line of about 4 people ahead of me and then, when it was my turn, I made a $32 order.  One burrito order was pretty much deconstructed (down to the whole wheat tortilla substitution) and then reconstructed.  But they got it all done in a sufficient amount of time and they did it all with a smile.  No attitude whatsoever.  

Everyone enjoyed the food and the salsas.  OH...a worker came out to spiff up the salsa bar while we were waiting too.  I love that with even a busy crowd, workers can work in some side cleaning.  That says a lot about the staff.  

Definitely hit up this place.  Better than greasy Chinese food or even greasy McDonald's."}
{"text":"Didn't find the hype everyone was talking about here. 

Its my first time here on a Tuesday afternoon. Skipping out on breakfast, my buddy and I ordered the fish tacos on special. And just for the record they are $1.50 each, not a buck. (makes a big difference when ordering 8 lol) It was nice of them to bring my order to the table but, the food was not fresh to the bite nor very warm. Seems like the fish was just sitting on a warm rack waiting to be ordered. 
Aside the Verde salsa, I did not catch flavor from the other three. Especially the Chipotle sauce which tasted more burnt than anything. 

Don't criticize me though, from all the other 4 and 5 star reviews, I may have received the bad batch of fish and sauce that day. I'll be visiting again soon. :)"}
{"text":"Well, that was just terrible.  Their taquitos are filled with some kind of creamy chicken paste, their nachos are really dry, and everything is terribly salty.  This place makes Chipotle look authentic."}
{"text":"My chipotle ranch salad with salmon ($8.99) was served shortly after I ordered at the counter. It was generously sized, with plenty of salmon, fresh veggies, guacamole, salsa fresca, and tortilla chips. The chipotle ranch dressing was tasty, but too plentiful. Maybe it's available on the side for next time. I liked the clean, extensive, toppings bar and the clean dining area. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is the definition of three star A-Ok.  The Food is decent, but not all that memorable or flavorful.  The prices are also decent.  The cost runs about the same as Chipotle, but this place is no Chipotle.

I do love that not only does Rubio's serve fish tacos, there are grilled options.  Not only is it healthier, but I personally am not a fried fish guy.  The price for a Pacific Mahi Mahi Taco plate (two tacos, chips, and beans) is a little north of $8.  Not bad for a fairly filling meal.  The fish it self is good.  The toppings are good.  Everything tastes surprising fresh for quick service.  But the sauce is extremely lacking, and when it comes to fish tacos, it's pretty much all about the sauce.  The beans were fine.  The chips were nothing special.  I wasn't a big fan of any of the salsa options.

If you are looking for cheap, quick, and not greasy Mexican food, Rubio's is a doable eatery."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh! Decor was lovely for a quick eats establishment. Only lost a star because my dining partner was very specific about what she did NOT want inside her tacos ( salsa, jalapeños etc) and everything was still inside when she received them. So you may want to check first before you eat if you have an allergy."}
{"text":"I came here for the fish tacos... but likely won't be back. I prefer mine lightly battered and these were pretty heavily breaded and fried. The first two bites didn't even have fish in them, just breading. They do have different varieties, so maybe some of the other kinds are better?"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. This was my very first visit to Rubio's. Found out what I was missing. First off, the manager was very helpful. Said she was with the company for 3 years here and in Tucson. I stuck with the Shrimp Burrito...wasn't disappointed. Staff was helpful, restaurant was clean and presentable, food was delicious, and everything seemed healthy."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this Rubio's quite a few times. Strangely enough it is probably the furthest Rubio's from where I live here in the valley. But I do have a friend who lives close by and if I'm in the area it is always nice to stop in and grab some tacos.

I like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.

The chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. 

Lastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location."}
{"text":"We recently dined at this location. Upon receiving our food, we noticed a mistake in the order. We brought it to the attention of the manager. Her name was Carrie, and she was very gracious, going above and beyond to make things right. It made the experience pleasurable in spite of the mistake. We will definitely be dining here again!"}
{"text":"We're used to the great service from the Arizona Rubio's that this Rubio's doesn't compare.  Only my husband was eating and it was 3 fish tacos.  It took SOOOO long for them to make these, it wasn't funny.  I saw other people get their food and leave and still he hadn't gotten his tacos.  He finally got his tacos.

Anyway, thankfully the Rubio's we go to all have better service.  This wasn't the worst, and we had had bad service at a McDonald's the day before, so the fact we didn't get great service was a bit of a shock as well as a disappointment."}
{"text":"We've been coming here lately because they get my husband's order right unlike the Rubio's at Germann & Gilbert and Warner & Cooper, which often gets my husband's order incorrect.  This particular Rubio's is always clean.  The manager is always around when we come in and works hard to make his restaurant really good.

We're happy to come here now regularly, as we now live closer to this location."}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I love Rubio's, especially me.  I've been to a lot of Rubio's and I always get the same great service and delicious food consistently, that's why we continue to go here.

We got an Ancho Shrimp Burrito and it was so yummy.  Used a birthday cert and I gave my son the burrito and he wolfed it down.  He always gets some shrimp thing.

TJ, the manager that helped me when I went to pick up my order comped the rest of the burrito for the birthday.  So, it was completely free instead of making me pay another $1+.  That was very kind of him and totally unexpected.

We just happened to be in the area and my son was hungry and I had a certificate to use, so we stopped by here.  Will come back to again when we are in the area, but we have been here a few times over the past 2-3 years and always excellent!!

Thank you, TJ!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Southern California where you can get some GREAT tacos - This place reminds me of all the great tacos along the beach area in So Cal.  Highly recommend it - some of the best tacos in Vegas.  I've tried every taco on the menu - all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had never been here before until yesterday.  Came with a girlfriend for dinner.  Decided to get the Coastal Trio to try a variety of their tacos.  I LOVED the classic fish taco. That was definitely my favorite, followed by the salsa verde shrimp taco (super yum).  The last taco was the Regal Springs Tilapia taco and it was so spicy, I could hardly eat it. Either the blackening spices or the serrano slaw made this a must for those who adore spicy things, but it definitely burned the crap out of my dainty little taste buds so beware if you're sensitive to spice.
They have $1.50 classic fish tacos on Tuesdays which is a steal.  I'm definitely coming back to take advantage of that.  The salsa bar was well stocked and the salsa verde was delicious.  The lady behind the register was very nice and happily delivered our food to our table one it was ready.  Overall, I had a great experience.  This is definitely not fine dining, but you can escape the heat, take a seat, and nosh on some pretty kick a** tacos in between getting your shopping fix."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I did not order the $1.50 Original Fish Tacos.  They were located on West Sahara Ave/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.

I had a coupon for free chips and guacamole with the purchase of an entree.  i ordered my favorite Chipotle Shrimp Salad.  i was disappointed that there were no fresno chiles on the salad like they have at other locations.  Maybe the person making the salad forgot to put them on.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"We had family in town and I didn't want to cook. I get tired of pizza or subs for larger groups (10 of us) and wanted something fairly healthy. I thought of Rubio's and wasn't disappointed! Everything was ready on time, and our burritos and salad were delicious. I'll definitely use Rubio's again for my catering needs."}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic bean and cheese burrito.  The tortilla was so fresh and tasty.  The beans were creamy and well spiced.  There was the perfect amount of cheese.  The meal was fast was well priced and the staff was friendly.  The atmosphere was pleasant and clean.  Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I love Rubios in general, but this one is subpar. I always order without white sauce and 9/10 they put it on my order and have to send it back. Often it's clear they just replaced the tortilla but left the fish covered with the sauce. It also seems to take forever for food to come out (and be remade) even when there are only 1-2 people at the restaurant. 
Overall, I'd recommend choosing a different location if you can, or skipping this one."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here today and we're not impressed. The cashier was not very friendly on the welcome. Tables and floor were unkept. Upon receiving our food, my wife said her grilled steak tacos were cold and not as flavorful as she had at Rubios, elsewhere. My Shrimp burro was mushy and lacked flavor as well, but ended abruptly when I pulled a hair out. When escorting my 5 year old son found a used bindle on the floor to which he pointed out on the floor and I ushered him out post haste. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I usually don't choose Rubio's when I'm at the food court at Red Rock.  But I got tired of Villa's pizza, flatbreads from Tropical Smoothie and the shredded turkey from Capriotti's.  The sign said \"Avocado Quinoa Bowl with Chicken and Lime Cilantro dressing, and it called to me.  

It was delicious and very filling; it also had black beans, caramelized onions, and slivered almonds, with some red peppers and a bit of lettuce for added crunch.  If I had checked in on Yelp before retrieving my meal, I would have saved $2.  But that dish was so good that I know it won't be long before I have it again and can even save a couple of bucks."}
{"text":"I'm at Red Rock almost every Wednesday night.  Not because it's Senior Night - I'm way too young for that ;).  It's my night to be out alone, without a non-gambler looking over my shoulder.  Not that I'm a high roller, far from it.  After all, I eat dinner at the food court.  And for the last three Wednesdays, my place of choice has been Rubio's.  I've had the same dish each time:  the Chicken-Quinoa-Lime bowl.

With lots of chicken, black beans, quinoa, brown rice and, whoa - a ton of sliced almonds - in addition to a few other goodies, this dish can't be beat.  It is such a huge portion that I can't even think of it as being healthy; there's just too much of it, and I don't stop when I'm full.  But it sure is delicious.

I've had other terrific things at Rubio's in the past - their chicken with balsamic veggies is another favorite - but as long as they keep offering the quinoa I'm gonna keep on ordering it.  And there's even a $2 discount for checking in on Yelp.  Way to go, Rubio's."}
{"text":"Service is awesome.  Staff is great, ordered tilapia burrito stuff with rice, sweet corn, purple cabbage, omg it was delicious, recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN STREET TACOS!!!  Btw this Rubio is inside the Monte Carlo ( MGM Resorts employees like Aria,Vdara,Luxor,Mirage etc..) gets 15% off just show your employees I.d."}
{"text":"bomb ass street tacos forever fresh, enuff said!"}
{"text":"I think Rubios deserves a shout out! Especially because I ate there three times in a row and ordered the same exact thing every time. What was so delicious that had me addicted three days in a row...the Gourmet Shrimp Tacos! They were so good and it was even topped with bacon. The tacos had a sweet smokey flavor to them. They were cheap but didn't taste like it!"}
{"text":"Store is dirty, burnt out lights, really doesn't seemed to be maintained like it use to be back in the day. The food was fresh but just looking but the lines were hella old. They had the good yellow brown edge all around them. Store could use some TLC before I consider coming back."}
{"text":"2/28/13

Redeemed a couple of free fish taco coupons I was given at the Yelp event held here a couple of years ago (?).  Was told they were for the Alaskan pollock- the same ones we were given at the party.  While I waited for these to be prepared, I realized I don't like the atmosphere indoors, as it felt too fast-foodish for me, and yes, I realize that I am writing a review on Rubio's... I guess dining al fresco is the way to go when you're here.  Should I ever go back, I will choose outdoor dining, or just go for takeout and head to a nearby bar with a better selection of beers and wine and better atmosphere, as well.

Oh, and I liked the beer-battered pollock with the greens and signature \"white sauce\" on flour tortillas.  Just wished each taco came with more than just the one lime wedge-- I need more acid to cut through the grease!

FYI, I was told by a Mexican coworker, who used to work at Rubio's many, many years ago, that the beans' side dish is well-prepared here, for those who are health-conscious.  It isn't refried in lard like in other places.  I can't say I've tried it in recent times, so I can't comment on it any further-- just passing on what she told me."}
{"text":"Love this place! People are friendly, place is clean. I normally have the salmon burrito which I LOVE but, in my low carb world I went with the Balsamic Salad with chicken. It was fabulous!! Everything fresh and tasty. Great place for a quick healthy work lunch!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get cheap and quick Mexican food? Look no further than Rubio's! I don't know what they add to their food to make them so addictive but I can't get enough of their shrimp tacos or their burritos! Service is always excellent. Bonus points go to the guacamole appetizer!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review now that they batter the tacos at each location. Wow does it make a difference, the fish breading is extra crispy & way more flavorful. These tacos are better than most sit down restaurants and they still sell them for $1.50 each on taco Tuesday.  This location always has the best service and it's a clean locations with a clean bathroom."}
{"text":"What a great find! This was my first time checking out Rubio's. Honestly I was thinking this was a certain \"other\" mexican place in Aliante. But I was willing to try this one instead. Glad I did! I thought it would be a good late lunch while waiting for my movie to start...I was pleasantly surprised! YUMMY YUMMY street tacos! Now I am a huge fan of street tacos, but these were amazing! Especially for a \"fast food\" place. I'm used to the little vendor stalls at local events and was not expecting to be blown away. This really was like eating tacos in Mexico! Only I didn't have to worry about getting sick! haha
I had the 3 little carnitas street tacos with chips and beans. A small side of the mild salsa and an ice tea! I asked for it to go, since I don't usually manage to finish a complete meal. Was I wrong. I ate all 3 tacos which were warm and juicy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the cilantro and onions on top! I am a huge fan of cilantro, so if you are not you may not appreciate this as much as I did, but it's not overwhelming like some other Mexican places I have eaten at. The side of beans seemed small at first, but combined with a bit of salsa and the chips it was perfect! My mouth is watering just writing this review! The beans did need a bit of salt to meet my taste...just saying! The mild salsa was a bit too \"tomatoey\" for me, but they do advertise it as tomato based...I'm going to have to try their tomatillo salsa next time. 
They use Lipton leaf tea here so I was pleased! Even unsweetened it was delicious and refreshing. (Just an FYI, I managed to walk into the movie theater with this cup and nobody batted an eyelash!)
BONUS!
So, I don't know what the service is like on a weekend or evening, but since Monday afternoons are my movie days now I thought this was a perfect lunch on my perfect day off! Thank you Rubio's and Aliante station for making my day wonderful!
I hope everyone can enjoy this location!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice little Rubio's.  The employees there are super friendly.  The place is spotless clean too, and the salsa bar is hella fresh, clean, and well stocked.  My burrito was bomb.  I like going there when I want something under $10 and not super heavy.  Location is great too cuz it's in a nice shopping center and starbucks is right next to it so you can get your frapp on after eating.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The manager is fantastic. I've been there 30 plus times and have NEVER had a bad dinner.. amazing... love it... the  chicken burrito is fantastic, chips too...."}
{"text":"I order a lot of catering for lunch presentations and this is the best Rubios by far to order from. Great customer service and the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"First time ever coming here even though I live less than a mile away. I have to admit it was fantastic! I ordered the Surf & Turf taco plate. Both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh. 
I got the Spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious, not dry and over cooked like most places. 
The young man at the register \"Chris\" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant. I will definitely be coming back to check out the $1.50 tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am a fan of Rubio's. I have been to several restaurants, but this was my first time at this location. It was a bit challenging to find, so be sure to look for the Party City store and look across from it.

One of the things I like about Rubio's is they have a lot of lighter and healthier options.

Don't forget the Fish Tacos! The beer battered fish tacos are really popular.

I may eat mostly vegetarian, but eat fish once in a while. If you go there on Tuesdays, they run a special on fish tacos, and if you sign up for the Beach club you get coupons and a free taco.

Very good value."}
{"text":"My last review didn't post, but it is worth repeating,  I love this place. The food is very fresh and tasty, BUT the best part is the staff. SO FRIENDLY and professional. The manager Mark leads by example and is ALWAYS at his best. He and his team make me feel welcome and it's  kinda like my Cheers."}
{"text":"I suppose this goes for any Rubio's location, but why so expensive? Way overpriced for what you get. I'd rather pay the same amount, or less, in a real restaurant. Also, we always had hit or miss service here... sometimes good, sometimes not so great. As for the food, well, it wasn't that memorable. Well, since we're stuck out here in AZ, I guess this is the closest we can get to the real thing?"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you order off a menu at the counter like you would at McDonalds. 
But coming the first time, it would have been beneficial to look at the menu online first. LOL! 
I got the trio tacos, which has the traditional fried fish taco, shrimp taco and grilled Mahi Mahi. The grilled Mahi Mahi was my favorite, but all were good. 
We got an order of the guacamole and chips to share, but both filled up on tacos and ended up throwing the chips away. 
They have a small salsa bar that had many choices from chipotle, med salsa, tomatillo, to jalapeño citrus to name some.  I like the jalapeño mostly because of the spicy it added. What can I say, this Louisiana gal likes it hot!  ;)
I really enjoyed this place and will return to try some of the other choices."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos love them and the sauce, I dont think I have ever had a bad taco or service here"}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve any stars whatsoever! How are you guys still in business??! I came in here a few nights ago ordered two burritos to go. The salsa bar didn't look so hot. That should have been the writing in the wall for how my burrito would taste! Then as I wait for my food a guy and girl call dibs on the desserts and start packing them up it's 8 o clock and they close at 9! My food was cold and tasted very bland. I don't remember ordering a rice burrito! Stay away from this place just don't do it!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today one person ahead of me cafe not full took 1/2 hour to get my food.  Don't understand how this happens doesn't even take this long to get food at a full on Mexican restaurant that is packed full.  Pretty rediculous if you ask me. Should have gone to subway next door"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of fish tacos, some people cringe at the thought, but that's because they have never had a fish taco from here. Rubio's by far has the best fish taco, it is absolutely delicious. After 2:30 pm on Tuesday is \"Taco Tuesday\" and fish taco's are $1.50/ea."}
{"text":"The new Brown rice and Quinoa (salad) blows are so good and tasty. I just had one with grilled shrimp - it was fantastic. They are definitely stepping olio the game from fast food !"}
{"text":"Where is the steak? Found a small amount at the end of burrito after I ate a pound of rice to get to it, hardly even noticed it. Sucks, should have started at the other end. Hope this place is replaced with Roberto's"}
{"text":"I am really pleased with the fish tacos and fast service. I was greeted with a friendly smile and they got me my order with a quickness. They fish tacos were perfect and tasty. The place is clean. Their parking sucks . Really, the parking lot is zoo."}
{"text":"Great food! The salsa bar is amazing, the tomatillo sauce and the picante are the best. The pickled peppers are amazing as well.
They had the best guacamole we had ever had but we are from Kentucky so didn't have the best comparative base.

Grilled gourmet steak tacos were amazing!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, lately when I go it is very bland and boring.  I don't know if they have gotten worse or my taste buds have just gotten more picky.  It is better then like Taco Bell or something, but it isn't really that wonderful."}
{"text":"Flew in from out of town and stopped in with fellow travelers who have eaten here before.  For a quick lunch with a Mexican flair this place hit the spot!  Bright and inviting little place in a strip mall, with very friendly staff.  Service was pretty quick and the food came out hot and fresh looking.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Enchilada and it was delicious.  Only negative to me was that the two enchiladas were on the small side, so if you are really hungry, try the 'pick two' enchilada meal.  It came with rice and beans, which were typical fair, but worked well with the what was a really good enchilada."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh and the staff were very friendly. Price is comparable to chipotle but they have fish here which is my go-to at Rubio's even though it costs a little more than Chipotle. 

LOVE the mahi mahi bowl and well worth $8.50"}
{"text":"First time trying Rubio's, although I've always passed by them wanting to try. I ordered through a third party, so it was for delivery. We ordered a chicken quesadilla ($7.99), a grilled shrimp burrito enchilada style ($8.69) and a large order of both rice and beans ($1.79 x2).

The delivery itself was pretty quick, which was awesome because we were pretty hungry. The chicken quesadilla was just okay, a little bland but good. The grilled shrimp burrito was really tasty, just a little heavy on the rice inside of it per shrimp ratio. They gave us two sides of their chipotle sauce so that was great because it was sooo good on the food and because we were served a bunch of tortilla chips it doubled as a dip! The only real big let downs was the food itself was delivered COLD. Which I don't have this issue a lot at all with the third party. I assume they made the food early and it just sat there waiting for the driver to arrive. Also, they forgot our large side of beans! We were totally bummed! It wasn't a lot of money ($1.79) but it was off just eating the side of rice without the beans to go with it."}
{"text":"In all honesty this place is TERRIBLE. I've been to many Rubio's locations but this one's by far the worst. The food is pretty poor quality in comparison to other locations...I mean yeah it's still decent for 'fast food' but they aren't even fast enough getting the food out to label their service \"fast\". The employees are ALWAYS rude and actually one of the shift leads is pretty condescending with his comments. For example, he told me to \"stop talking\" when in the middle of ordering. Another time, my sister ordered toppings for her tacos on the side and after clarifying and repeating the order back (like he should) multiple times the employee put the order in. The food still came out wrong and the employee said my sister had never asked for the toppings on the side and threatened to charge her to change it. He ended up fixing it after we said that was ridiculous but he continued to act pretty irritated toward us. (Haven't seen him back since) The portions aren't always reasonable, but I mean other things obviously need to be fixed, such as their customer service skills, before they address their portion size ;)"}
{"text":"Rubio\"a is always a good choice when you want to grab some food quick, but you still want to keep it healthy.

I always order the same thing when I eat at Rubios. The Health Mex Burrito. It is pretty good and a much healthier choice than other fast food options. I have tried the fish tacos here before and they are very good as well.

This location is at the Food Court in the Red Rock Casino. The prices are higher than other locations, but that is expected of any eatery in a casino."}
{"text":"This place is a healthy alternative to fast food Mexican food places. They have good fish tacos too. The one reason I come here is that they don't put lard in any of their food. The pinto beans and black beans are vegetarian. I would recommend this place over any other fast food Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey for essentially being one step up from Taco Bell. I ordered the California salad with grilled chicken. Would have probably been better if ALL the rice was cooked instead of only half of it. :("}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Rubio's in a really long time, but I had been carrying a gift card in my wallet that I remembered about when I was shopping over here so I figured I might as well use it. It was a Tuesday no less, which meant \"Taco Tuesday\" (which is what I took advantage of).

I got a bunch of the $1.75 ones, which were good. They're pretty simple... lightly breaded white fish, cabbage, and some kind of creamy sauce that was good but not overpowering. They come on corn tortillas, which I liked. They also have a $2 taco on Tuesday that has guac. 

It wasn't that crowded when I was there, but it seemed like there were some mobile/online orders they were dealing with as well so I did have a to wait a little bit for my order (EVERYONE was ordering tacos and lots of them....why not at that price!).

I also got my nephew a kids meal, and there's a good variety to choose from . He got chicken nuggets (you can also get a taco or cheese crisp I believe) w/tortilla chips (you can also choose rice) and a churro (chocolate chip cookie is an option). It also came with a drink. He liked everything.

I should also point out this location has a VERY clean salsa bar. I tried all three, and like them all."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's fish tacos, and my wife loves the salmon burrito. I really love Rubio's on Tuesday with the special on tacos. The service is really quick and I've tried 2 other Rubios with the same great service. It's very clean and the food is great. I will be back hopefully today."}
{"text":"First time here and it was Really yummy! I got the classic chicken taco plate. I don't like beans so I didn't taste them, but the tacos and the chips were really good. The size was the chips was nice as well, small and bite size! The salsa bar was interesting... The mild salsa tasted like BBQ sauce and the tomatillo, the green one, was really good! The staff was very friendly and brought the food to you. On my way out I got a key line cake pop...OMG SO GOOOOOOD!"}
{"text":"Standard Rubio's Baja-style Mexican fare, with friendly service. The salsa bar has 3-4 different salsas to choose from, including a green tomatillo salsa and chipotle. The mahi mahi burrito was a large portion with big chunks of fish, a flavorful sauce, with cabbage, guacamole and rice."}
{"text":"When I came to Rubios today I ordered the Baja especial steak burrito. I paid .99 to add sour cream. When I began to eat my burrito, I found it had no sour cream in it, and they added lettuce. Ewe. Hot soggy lettuce. I brought it back, and instead of making me a new burrito, they added sour cream to my already bitten one and chose to leave the lettuce in it. My chips were chewy, and my family spent $33. We could've gone out somewhere with fresher food! It is expensive, and they did nothing to fix their mistake. I still leave 2 stars because I have been there before and ordered the same burrito that was pretty good. I'd rather not roll the dice when my wallet is at stake."}
{"text":"Great experience here! Lexy the shift manager was so nice and accommodating to my food restrictions thank you!!"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy Rubio's but this last time was a bit unpleasant. When we first walked in, I noticed (the manager?) Erik yelling at the kitchen staff. He then took our order and rushed through everything and wouldn't let me get a word in. When my fiancé ordered, he also rushed through it and forgot to ask flour or corn for the tortillas. My fiancé realized this shortly after and returned to the counter (before food was delivered) to ensure his tacos came on his preferred tortilla. Erik said something along the lines of \"okay, well that's why we ask what tacos you want when you order\". 

The food was wonderful, but very bad service this time around."}
{"text":"Usually this location is really good and friendly, however, we walked in to this location to the employees arguing about someone's order, for starters. We order our food and sit down and they bring our plates and tell us, \"silverware is inside\", ok, I'm cool, I'll get em. I go inside and there is no silverware. I wait at the counter for 7full minutes while my spouse waits and finally someone says, \"can I help you?\" I let her know I need 2 forks and her response is, \"aren't there any out there?\" Uh, would I have stood up here if there was, I was thinking. She goes to the back and comes back with 2 cold, dripping wet forks with food still in them. By this time she's already walked away and I have to wait again to let her know that I'd prefer a clean fork!"}
{"text":"While having dinner with my toddler, one of the employees started sweeping under the table I was sitting/eating at and hit my foot twice with the broom. They were not supposed to close for a half hour. I asked her to please stop sweeping under the table until after I finished my meal and left. She ignored me so I asked again and said \" you have hit my foot twice could you please stop\". She gave me a hateful look went behind my chair and kept sweeping under my chair. I said are you really going to give me attitude and keep sweeping? Then I asked for a manager. I'm pretty sure the young man that was walking around the corner when it happened wasn't the manager but he said he was. I told him what had happened and his only response was \"so she hit your foot twice, I'll talk to her about that.\" No sorry or apologies to me and didn't ask her to stop sweeping. This employee was so disrespectful to me as a \"paying customer\". To sweep under a customer while they are eating and then disregard anything I asked and keep doing it. Very disappointed! If she worked for me I would have fired her on the spot. The food isn't worth it to be treated like this. The owner should really do his homework and find out what kind of person he has working for him. Lost a customer today. I will never be back to this location or any others."}
{"text":"J and I are fans of the Fish Tacos here.  And we usually only go on Tuesday when they're $1.50 a piece. Dinner for the 2 of us for under $9.00, not too shabby!!!  

J is a fan of the hot carrots they have at the salsa bar. It usually never fails when I go, I'm scavenging for the last few slices from the two containers. So I casually mentioned, \"You know, you guys should have a separate container just for carrots!\" The lady informed me that they do not make their hot carrots (I was under the impression they did), but that they come from a can that has both the chilis and carrots. She then said, \"Let me go open a new can and get you some.\" Sweet!!! Well, more like HOT!! :) 

Arcadia Rubio's, you're a-okay in my book!  Especially on Taco Tuesdays! :)"}
{"text":"Rubios is a version of a fast mex food... their specialty is \"sea\" tacos.. Tilapia, shirp, lobster tacos... their prices are very good and their food very delicious. also if you sign up online you can receive discounts and a free meal on your b-day.. 
i would recommend their combos.. half salad + any taco or their bowl..
the chipotle salad was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad.  Its very similar to Baja Fresh! 
They have a little salsa bar that you can use.   

Their food isn't too greasy or fried.  It does have a little too much salt but if your gonna eat unhealthy fast food and dont wanna feel guilty this is the place to eat at.

The service was great and the place was neat and clean.  
Overall it's a solid place."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic, always friendly.  I love the grilled veggie burro, and also the portabello and poblano taco!  My son loves the cheese quasadilla kids meal, it's sort of rolled like a cheesy burro which makes it easy for him to manage.  On our most recent trip my mom tried the grilled grande bowl and really enjoyed it, she said it was perfect for summer, not as heavy as a burro but very yummy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the veggie burro it's got these super yummy mushrooms in it!  They also have a great mushroom and pepper taco.  Always happy to see places with some vegetarian representation!    

Service is always quick and friendly even when it's packed.  

You'll definitely pay a little more then regular fast food, but this like Chipotle is so much better then regular fast food."}
{"text":"Coming from a Mexican, this is the best \"fast-food\" style Mexican restaurant in the Green Valley Area. Much better quality than Taco Bell / Dell Taco. Location is well managed and clean. Five stars!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this location and most of the staff recognizes us. It's nice to enter and see someone smiling back at you, ready to happily take your order! 
I order the fish taco plate most of the time. I did try the portobello mushroom tacos. They were good for a vegetarian option. 
The kids enjoy the chips, salsa, rice, beans a guacamole. All of these things you can get as sides in small portions. 
Thanks for providing a quality,kid friendly, and relaxed  lunch spot! See you next week!"}
{"text":"Money talks. And where I spend my money, I talk about it on Yelp. Even if it is for a $1.50 Tuesday fish taco special. 

  This Rubios is located in the Pebble Marketplace, which is the Smith's-anchored shopping center off Green Valley Parkway immediately north of the I-215 exit. It sits in the far northwest corner of the shopping center where it shares a patio with Starbuck's. With the corner facing windows and outdoor seating, it is an appropriate restaurant to experience the Vegas sunshine. 

  Between a hard days work and a cup of coffee before shopping in Smith's, the $1.50 Tuesday fish Taco special is a rewarding weekday treat. When I walk in the door, friendly employees including Vivian will greet me before taking my order. They will give me a water cup (immediately after I will be drinking a Starbuck's beverage) when I order the fish taco, a few minutes later deliver the taco to my table, then check up on me. Whenever they deliver a fish taco to my table, it has been tasty and filling. The toppings station is advantageous to the fish taco experience. There are all kinds of sauces including pacante plus peppers that you could place in a small cup or directly to the taco.

   After many Tuesdays spending  only $1.50 on a quality fish taco with a water cup served by friendly people, I talk good about Rubio's on Yelp. This is a  special that will brighten up a Tuesday."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came here and it was OK. 

The chicken was flavorful but the salsa were definitely lacking. 

Also, kind of on the expensive side considering it's a \" fast causal\" type place."}
{"text":"Great regional chain spot for a quick lunch. This place has some good fish tacos, the normal fried fish tacos and the mango habanero grilled mahi mahi tacos!  Both are tasty, if you go on a Tuesday the original fish tacos are $1.50 after 2:30pm.

The chicken burrito especial isn't a bad pick either.  The nice thing they also have here is a churro, nice ending for a quick lunch.  Most meals come with the pinto beans and chips which are pretty decent, nothing special but good.

This location is pretty clean and lots of space to eat inside or outside."}
{"text":"The staff is fantastic compared to how they were last year. Now they seem a lot more engaged and get your food out fast. If you go please try the coastal trio it's amazing and their fish tacos are some of the best! I enjoy trying the new burritos they put out!"}
{"text":"Before moving to Vegas I'd never even heard of fish tacos. Thanks to Rubios they've become one of my favorite things. I highly, highly recommend almost everything on their menu. I've tried everything from their classic fish tacos that they're known for up to their recent Lobster tacos and their Oaxacan shrimp tacos and have not been disappointed. When it comes to the food, this is one of my failsafe choices...I walk in the door and I know I'm not going to leave disappointed. And then there's the salsa bar...with one smoky, dark, flavor packed salsa that I can't get enough of. If I could buy it in bulk I would...I've never had anything quite like it. 

So why not give them 5 stars? I'm not a fan of their drink choices. Half the time their tea is empty, and their fountain drinks have been flat or off a couple of times. But that's the only flaw I've found after many repeat visits. 

In short....if you haven't tried Rubios yet, you're missing out. Oh and they take Apple Pay too and that's a plus in my book."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe there was this good of food from a food court. The food was the most delicious food i'v had in a long time although being a little pricy. I had the original fish taco and classic grilled shrimp burrito and it didn't just taste good, It made me want to eat it again. That woman in the kitchen deserves a pay raise. Every Time i took a bite i could feel the heat of the fresh food straight off the grill and we still got our food at a decent time. I am definitely a lifelong customer of Rubio's!"}
{"text":"Discovered this while in the area from out of town.  Really enjoyed this place.  Decent service, reasonable prices & tasty food!  Kind of like Chipotle with seafood."}
{"text":"Always greeted well here. Love their fish tacos but I ask on flour tortillas; they usually come on corn tortillas. The tilapia, chicken and shrimp tacos are also good. Tilapia taco has a slight spicy sauce. 
They have inside and outside seating. 
This is my favorite location as the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite of lunch. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the restaurant was very clean. Really enjoyed the classic grilled shrimp burrito meal!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place when i went out to visit my mother in Mesa, AZ. She eats there all the time and knows how to order right! As a southern boy walking into what i call a high class taco shop, it was a bit overwhelming! Super busy and long lines!
Asked my sister what to get and she said the California bowl. I go, a what? Yep super unfamiliar with the menu!
what is a California Bowl, Well its Made with citrus rice, black beans, and fresh romaine lettuce topped with handmade guacamole, salsa fresca, chipotle sauce, and your choice of roasted chipotle salsa or salsa verde. Served with your choice of Pan-Seared Shrimp, *Regal Springs® Tilapia (grilled or house blackened), Wild Mahi Mahi (grilled or house blackened), Wild Alaska Coho Salmon, grilled all natural chicken
Had the Mai Mah, shrimp and  salsa verde and it was so good! Got our drinks and the whole package to go and off to home to enjoy.
It was delicious, next time i go back to AZ I will try there tacos. that's saying a lot from the man who thinks jack In the Box tacos are the best! 
Restrooms were super clean and well tended too. I recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Fast Fresh Food Inside a Las Vegas casino!! The Rubio's is Fast!! We stopped for the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco and my husband Loved the fresh fish and the sauce they use.. We will be back next time we have to get a quick bite and we are at Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino in Vegas"}
{"text":"This Rubio's is my favorite. The chicken quesadillas are really good. The food and salsa bar are always fresh along with their condiments. Salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. . The staff are very quick and professional as well."}
{"text":"Normally I love Rubios. Was just not good today. Ordered the shrimp enchiladas. Got chicken. Will try again because I love their fish tacos which is what I should have had."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend who is a big fan; this was my first visit to a Rubio's.  We came in a little after 7pm, they are open week nights until 9pm.  We were served by an indifferent waiter at the counter.  There were a few other tables filled with other diners and some coming by for take-out.  

We filled our drinks from the beverage station.  Several choices for brewed iced tea that was very good.  I thought it odd that silverware was a mix of plastic (fork/spoon) and metal (knives).  The food was served in reusable plastic dishes.  I assume that the staff could not be bothered to the wash the missing metal utensils and plastic normally reserved for take-out was an easy fix.

On to the food - it was good!  I had a salad with grilled salmon.  Dressing on the side.  Tasty combo and good lettuce.  My friend enjoyed her favorite fish tacos.  

Staff was cleaning, sweeping, doing the nightly cleanup routine working around us.  Kind of annoying but we tried to ignore.  After some time, we returned to refill drinks from the beverage station.  It was 8:30 (remember 30 minutes before closing).  Nope, sorry the tea containers had all been removed for the night.  The fountain drinks dispenser had been broken down for cleaning.  What??  I questioned our waiter.  Yes, we removed them to clean and it would take atleast 25 minutes to brew more tea.  And why did you remove them at all?  \"Sorry about that\".  Yes, I bet you were.  And if I'd stayed around to watch, I bet you were locked up and out the door at 9:01 pm. 

Final rating - 4 stars food, 2 stars service.   So many other choices with better service -  I don't expect to return here."}
{"text":"We love this place and eat there often. It has fresh food, is consistant and very clean. The staff is very friendly and gets to know its customers. So far, our best place to eat in our area!  The girls that work there have become like friends to us, Amber and Vanba especially.  We ate there again last night and again we were pleased.  You always leave there full and content!
We always wind up going back there.  We highly recommend this Rubio's to anyone looking for a good meal in a friendly, clean environment.

{"text":"After using the spa I found myself hungry and didnt want to spend alot of money so I saw Rubios had fish tacos and decided to try them out.
They were ok..not the best I ever had. The beans were a bit runny that came with them but the chips & salsa were pretty good.
It was fine for a quick bite but would probably just hit LBS next time."}
{"text":"Terri-bowl! 25 minute wait for a $10  half-filled bowl with undercooked hard rice, some beans and 4 shrimp. Will not be back. Chipotle is a much better choice!"}
{"text":"Best Rubios in the valley! They are friendly, efficient, and have quality tasting food!"}
{"text":"Was not super impressed with the California Bowl (shrimp). Was mostly white rice and beans. Shrimp were tasty. Just OK and for $9 it's way overpriced. Go to Chipotle instead for better ingredients and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are awesome, but my favorite has got to be the shrimp tacos. We eat here maybe once a month and have had hot, delicious food every time! One time they accidentally put corn tortillas instead of flour for my daughters order. When the manager brought us fresh, hot flour tortillas he also gave us two coupons for a free taco on our next visit. The salsa bar and soda machines are always well stocked and clean."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $8. Paid $0. The email club sent me a free entrée on my birthday. It was because of that email that I tried Rubio's for the first time in a decade. The service was typical for at lunch for the restaurants in the area. The food came out hot and the cashier was friendly. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because the best part about this place was the salsa bar, the food was just kind of \"meh\". I would recommend mixing the onions and cilantro with the green sauce . I would also recommend trying your absolute hardest to avoid parking in the lot of this place, there are so many lunch places in the plaza area and people are crazy when they're hungry."}
{"text":"Regular retail price $18. Paid $9. Joined the Rubio's email club and they sent me a free taco, on my last day to use it they sent me a free kid's meal with the purchase of an adult meal. I did two transactions and the manager was really nice about it  The service is what makes this place four stars because the food is like a 3.5. ?"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Rubio's, so we were not sure what to expect. I'd never had a fish taco. I was quite impressed. I had the two fish tacos, especial with beans and chips. It was less than $6.00. Such a great deal. 
The complimentary salsa bar is great and adds some great flavor. 
The person taking our order, Brenda, was so helpful. She told us about their specials on \"Taco Tuesday\" which made our meal an even better deal. 
The food was hot, fresh, flavorful, and at a fantastic price!
I will definitely return to Rubio's"}
{"text":"Love their food but customer service was really bad I was surprised Rubios was always nice to come too not anymore I take my food to go"}
{"text":"a chain is nothing special so when i go i always look for service and this one offered great service...open late in the Monte Carlo"}
{"text":"I always love the food here but my boyfriend and I just wanted to take a moment and mention how wonderful Ben treated us. He went above and beyond and gave us options that we didn't even know were available. We really appreciated all of his help!"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here! So fresh and tasty. When I can't make it to Taco y Taco, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday they have $1.50 fish tacos after 2.30pm :)"}
{"text":"Service here is always friendly, and it's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck. Go for fish over lobster or shrimp, as you get more food for the buck, and it tastes good going down. Plus, salsa bar! They've added dessert, and the coconut-lime bars are really good. Not so good is the sangria, which has a strange cardboard background taste.

Why two stars? Well, it doesn't taste so good coming back up. Five hours later, it all did, and the problem lasted for 24 hours. That matches food poisoning with that meal as the source. It's too bad, as I enjoyed the meal while it was happening, but this is a risk I wouldn't take again."}
{"text":"Rubio's = runny beans. I am not a fan, much rather go to a baja fresh. Rubio's beans are so runny they will make any burrito fall apart regardless of the other fillings. Their chips are too salty, the shrimp (that you pay extra for) is more friend breading than actual shrimp, their chicken has a weird taste to it.. Almost alien.. Weird. The only thing that saves them from a 2 star review is the salsa bar. They have some pretty delicious salsas, oh yea and they serve beers."}
{"text":"The very first time I tried Rubios was when my family came to visit me out here. my dad told me to meet him and my family here for lunch as they awaited for me. At first I just thought it was going to be a regular Mexican Taco place. But boy was I wrong.. Rubios is probably one of my favorite places to go to in Vegas. After living here for a couple years already and never knew or heard about them I was so mad that I never came to their place. Their food is amazingly delicious and you will not have any regrets. My girlfriend's family came to visit her as well and I brought them to Rubios to try and they loved it so much that they \"forced\" me to take them there again before they left. For any person visiting Las Vegas, I would highly, highly recommend giving Rubios a taste that you will never forget."}
{"text":"Rubio's is an establishment I have been coming to for over 10 years now.  They are like family comfort food.  I have taken many family members and friends to this place, and they have become regulars themselves.  The food is always good, the salsa bar is fantastic, and the staff are helpful and friendly.  I tried the ancho grilled shrimp burrito - which was incredible.  The citrus mixture over the shrimp really enhanced the other ingredients in the flour tortilla.  My son got their  bean and cheese burrito with applesauce, churro, and organic drink.  They do allow you to swab out the flour tortilla for whole wheat.  Food was great, just as expected, and the price was just right.  Will always return."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the gourmet shrimp taco at Rubio's!!! I'd give 5 stars if the people working the counter were somewhat alive. Being from the Midwest, I was not at all familiar with Rubio's until my cousin recommended I go there. It's fresh food fast. We're not talking about tacos from TBell, this is really tasty stuff! I prefer a flour tortilla which you can substitute instead of corn. I don't know what exactly is in the sauce they put on the taco, but it makes my mouth sooooo happy! There are several types of fish to order as well..pollock, tilapia..grilled or fried. Order a meal and it includes two sides. I order my tacos a la carte and just get two. What's cool is they have a salsa bar from mild to plenty of heat, picante, verde, etc.. This is my new go to place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner after shopping.  They had a limited time lobster burrito so I gave it a try. Ordered it into a platter which added beans and a drink. The burrito was good and filling 3.5/5. The beans were a nice side to dip the tortilla chips in 3/5 but the tortilla chips were pretty ordinary 2.5/5. The counter staff, a very nice lady named Christine was very helpful even though she was inundated with a high number of customers."}
{"text":"I alway enjoy this place. Great food. Head over after 2:00 pm on Tuesday and have fish tacos for $1.50 each. Enjoy"}
{"text":"ordered two salads today, once again the food and the salads are always good.  the manager Dani was there and the employees are suppose to replace their gloves between meals, they did not I had to ask for the people who were making my food to put new gloves on and referenced several areas which were dirty which needed to be cleaned before making my food.  the manager did not agree.  good thing there is a corporate office"}
{"text":"Consistency of food is why I am giving this a 2 star.  I usually order the especial tacos and some days they have cole slaw  that over flows, and some days, you get a couple of strands.  Today, of the three tacos I got, 2 had slaw, 1 did not have hardly any, and 2 of the tacos were almost dry from the sauce that was supposed to be there, and one taco was so soaked in sauce that the tortilla fell apart as it was soaked to the max. Last three times I have been there it has been this way.  Restaurant is usually pretty busy and the condiment bar is usually a mess from all the people using it.  Not appealing."}
{"text":"I normally sneak a Chipotle burrito into Harkins when planning on watching a so-so movie several weeks after its release, but I couldn't find the Chipotle this time around (maybe they moved? maybe they closed?). I had to settle for Rubio's, and it wasn't too bad.

I ordered a beer-battered fish burrito and it came fully loaded with veggies, guacamole, sour cream, the works. I really enjoyed it--guac especially, but the fish became soggy towards the end of the burrito which was a disappointment but possibly an inevitability. If I were to rate the food alone, they'd maybe be a 4 star but it took almost 20 minutes for my food to come out--this is not something I usually expect when patronizing a mall restaurant in the food court, and it was between 6p and 7p on a weekday.

Overall not too bad, but there are many other options literally walking distance away."}
{"text":"I work next to this location of Rubio's and I come here all the time! It's always good friendly fast service. Sometimes they even give me free chips (I love their chips so this is a plus! ;) lol)
I've never had Rubio's before going to this location and I love it now.  I usually get the Gourmet Shrimp Tacos with double chips. Or the California bowl with chicken is filling and delicious as well."}
{"text":"i love eating here for lunch and always have...best tortilla chips in town"}
{"text":"Everything served here is excellent. The classic fish tacos are wonderful, but so are the burritos, as well as the traditional chicken and steak menu items. Something for everyone, even if you don't like seafood. Also, they have several choices of local beers."}
{"text":"Place has good fish tacos and good selection of different burritos. Good salsa choices Try their breakfast burritos, they are pretty good. But sadly it falls short from Chipotle. Lack of quality ingredients. At least they are better than Moes!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and perfect portion size. I wish they had locations in Texas. Got my free taco and it was outstanding"}
{"text":"In all my years, I never went to Rubio's much until recently. I can't believe how incredibly delicious it is, and now I'm disappointed in myself for missing out on years of intensely savory gourmet food. I LOVE the salsas and the sauces. Also the staff is great! They keep a good attitude even when I show up right before closing. 

(HINT: shrimp!)"}
{"text":"The food is great but lousy & poor in business. If you buy food fm here pls make sure you get your order right the first time. God forbid you forget to buy a drink or want to buy something else. Because you won't be able to do that. Or that you get full on the 1st meal because they don't give you anymore food. I bought my food then I planned on purchasing food to go because I was paying with same visa they didn't honor the transaction. I even agreed to pay extra for the card use. No! That's there policy one card swipe use a day & the register confirms. This is sad & poor service because there was not a sign to keep the customers informed of this beforehand. Money is money. I suggest they change that policy or get a new up to date modern card using machine or charge the visa transaction amount or put a sign up saying this. I wish I could've been informed about this before a purchased my meal then It would have given me a chance to buy everything in one shot one deal."}
{"text":"I had their Verde Shrimp tacos with avocado and it comes with chips and bean dip. 

AMAZING. I loved it and it's better than some of the higher end \"taco spots\" which charge more for less quality."}
{"text":"We always get the chicken tacos-- usually with all chips and their chipotle style salsa. We eat here when we're feeling for something fresh and not too heavy. They have the coolest little in-store events too; I picked up a free re-usable bag that touts a positive environment (ocean-related) message."}
{"text":"Top notch \"fresh Mex\" fare.  I'm pretty much a fish taco junkie when I go here, and it's not bad at all, could eat them every day.

Whole family finds something they like here, and there is a nice little beer selection as well.

Never once had a problem with service or my order.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious every time! 
They should run more specials and keep the salsa bar cleaner."}
{"text":"I typically don't write yelp reviews, but after tonight's visit it was necessary. The food was fine, but the staff was so unprofessional it was shocking. When a group of us walked up to the counter to order the entire kitchen staff just looked at us in disgust. Then started whispering to each other while we were up
There! Um hello?! We can see you! My husband and I's order came out in a timely matter, but our friends took 10 minutes after ours and all she got was nachos! Then the lady brought it out and said sorry it took so long we ran out of beans. My friend asked specifically not for beans. The kitchen staff was screaming and laughing in the background while customers were waiting for their orders. All in all, just a bad experience and definitely won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I love the whole theme and well, the food is great too, the CS is top of the line and well, it make food seem like well, so good, I always want to go back for 2nds; they, always seems to just do things that is just well, thank you for doing a great job and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"So me and my niece show up at this lady looks at us while we are walking up to the door and she locks it and looks away. Corporate will hear about this."}
{"text":"I work in the area and frequently come here when I don't feel like cooking dinner. Food is good. Customer service is good. My complaint is one particular employee. I understand it's a fast food job not paying much but please make your staff cover up their hickies. I DO NOT care to see fresh and old, discolored hickies all over the girl's neck. The area has a lot of senior citizens and I'm sure they don't want to see it either."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service.  I always go during lunchtime too. Manager helps just as much as his employees.  He was friendly and remembered people's orders.  

I don't like fish so no fish tacos for me! But I love their burritos. It is a lot of food!  

They are always clean when we come in too! Overall they are a wonderful inexpensive place to eat!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time when I want to have something quick and healthy. I grab the chicken bowl with either rice or salad. Can't go wrong with a fast food place with healthier options than most other fast food places."}
{"text":"ugh..  i like rubios but come on.. if you charge more but are worse than the other locations you should be slapped.. the beef was so dry it was practically leather.. they just opened but the fish tasted like it was made an hour ago..... i used to work for rubios so i know what I'm talking about... this place is far worse than their other locations"}
{"text":"Love this place , best seafood mexican chain restaurant I know of.  My first time at this location  , it's nice and clean. Big fan of the outdoor seating area. 

I think I have had almost all the items on the menu, but I would say my favorite  has to be the gourmet shrimp taco ( I get mine with a flour tortilla ), taste better than most of the expensive mexican restaurants. 

I also like to get the chicken tortilla soup , it's delicious.  It has the perfect amount chicken and its full of flavor. 

So to sum it all up , it's the best costal mexican taco shop not in mexico."}
{"text":"This location gets busy at lunch time .. they have plenty of inside and patio seating.. 

Check the boards as you walk in for specials .. that's where the good stuff is advertised .. 

I usually have the fish or shrimp tacos but today the pic for their new bowls caught my eye .. I had the avocado mango quinoa bowl with the grilled shrimp (the shrimps extra $) .. it came out in a huge bowl and was really good .. a little bit of green tomatillo salsa helped dress the salad greens under the quinoa .. 

The food is consistent with this chain and this location never disappoints"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for lunch before our movie, for her 10th bday last Saturday at about 2-3pm. (her choice) The food was good, no complaints there but the girl working the front needs a real attitude adjustment. My daughter and I walked in, the worker was sweeping by the front door. She didn't greet us or say a word. We walked to the cash register to order and she just kept sweeping for a good 5 minutes. She didn't make her way to the register until I just kept looking at her. Still not a word from her. She walked to the register... Just stares at me and still says nothing... So I just start telling her my order. She tells me my total, And still says nothing else even after I paid. I say \"thank you\" to her when she handed me my cup and still NOT A WORD from her. WOWWWWW. 

My 10 year old and I go to sit outside to wait for our food. The same girl brings our food outside... And literally tosses my food down on the table, and guess what doesn't say a word! She was EXTREMELY rude! I have been coming to this rubios off and on for 6 years and have never been treated like that. Me being there was such an inconvenience  to her. Hey \"gizzy\" treat your customers a little better, or find a new line of work. Seriously...I don't care how good your food is, I won't be returning after that."}
{"text":"Rubio's is one of the best fish tacos you will find.  Sure, it's a chain, and some may call it fast food, but it has been a staple in the Southern California area for years, and has always produced the best fish taco.  And if it is fast food, then I am fine with enjoying this fast food.  Any fast food that serves me a Pacifico with my meal is my kind of fast food.  

Just like most restaurants, at Rubio's, it's all in what you order.  Don't veer away from the classics.  They didn't become popular because they make great carne asada and chicken tacos.  They became popular because of their fish taco.  Their Original Fish Taco is the best thing on the menu.  Lightly beer-battered Pollock (Cod), fresh tomatoes, chopped onions, white sauce, cilantro, cabbage, and served with a fresh lime.  For many Southern Californians, fish tacos like this are like comfort food.  

If you really don't want to get the fish taco, and there is, for some reason, no possibility that you can force yourself to get the best thing on the menu (the fish taco), then you should get the Mahi Mahi Burrito.  They grill Mahi Mahi and serve it in a flour tortilla with salsa, white sauce, cilantro, and lime.  I usually get it without rice and beans in the burrito, but they usually also have rice and beans in the burrito.  This is a very good fish burrito, one of the best you will find, but I still suggest you get the fish taco.  

Also make sure you order a Pacifico or Bohemia with your tacos!"}
{"text":"We get dinner from here at least a few times a month! The food is always excellent as well as the service. The employees greet you with a smile and actually pay attention when taking your order! The managers have chatted me up a few times when I've been there waiting for my order and were very friendly as well.

The food is excellent! It's basically restaurant quality but at fast food prices! They're not cheap, but cheaper than going to a restaurant!

I LOVE the fish tacos and have been getting them from Rubio's (and Chuy's when they were still around) for 20 years. They're so good I keep coming back for more!
For those who are more health conscious, they have many healthy choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Anytime I am in town, I alway asked to get fish tacos at Rubio's.  I love their lightly battered fish ,which is a nice size unlike other wimpy fish tacos I have had. This week I stopped in and tried the Oaxacan Shrimp limited edition taco which blew me away with flavor.  The fish taco seems bland next to this.  Nice work Rubio's! 

And I just signed up for their Beach club!  Excited to go back since this location is less than 5 minutes from my mom's house. I can literally walk there!"}
{"text":"First time to going to a Rubio's for us. After ordering we went to sit down and the dining area was very small and extremely filthy. We decided to take our food home. Food was decent albeit overpriced for what you get. Doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"I go to Rubio's at Red Rock at least once a week for lunch. I get the same thing every time - a chopped salad with chicken. Why? Because it tastes fresh and it's probably one of the healthiest choices in the casino."}
{"text":"I just ate here yesterday afternoon. I had 3 fish tacos. Today I am suffereing from food poisoning. How lovely."}
{"text":"I ordered catering (on 3/25/2017) for my husband's surprise 30th bday. It was casual and poolside so I wanted something yummy and my husband loves the fish tacos!

I had family pick the food up so I actually was not able to talk to anyone in person there, but they did an amazing job! The price is awesome for all that they provide. I ordered four of the taco bar option (variety of chicken, steak, fish) and they included serving utensils, plates, forks, napkins.

With about 35 people I thought we could be cutting it close on food, but with the overflowing bags of chips, the guacamole, salsa, beans and rice, we had plenty of food and some leftovers! The fish especially was wiped out quick, it might have been the favorite :) 

Lots of compliments to Rubios. For a casual get together they package everything as a ready to go party for you! It made my life so much easier (and made the surprise possible) without compromise of good food. We will totally get Rubios catering again!"}
{"text":"I'ma keep this simple.  I only come here on Tuesdays for their 1.50 fish tacos. 

fresh, delicious, and always hits the spot.

I like up dress up my tacos with their assorted sauces and sides.  Always a good choice after a workout.

They have forever earned my business with their customer service and demeanor."}
{"text":"Food is a tad too spicy for me due to the sauces, but a fresher and healthier choice when compared to typical fast  food fare.  Very good service.   A bit higher in price than I'd like.   Salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service from Joshua and Amalia. Joshua went above and beyond. Thank you!"}

Fast service

Friendly staff.

In center near Target & Marshalls"}
{"text":"We love 1/2 price Taco Tuesday!!!  Always fresh and delish!  Can't eBay fish tacos for 1.50 each!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have to admit that the first time I heard of a fish taco from a fast food chain restaurant I was skeptical...skeptical of the quality, taste, and freshness. Nevertheless, I gave Rubios fish tacos a try and fell in love. These delicious tacos are crispy, crunchy, flaky, tender, and melt in your mouth. With the addition of lime juice they are heavenly. Along with the fish tacos I frequently enjoy their quesadillas that they fill generously with cheese and whatever fillings you'd like, and a plain bean burrito. I'm not sure what it is about the beans, but they are amazing. Everything on the menu is tasty and fresh; you can order as healthy or unhealthy as you'd like, and there is something for everyone. Rubios offers a variety of salsas to choose from
at their salsa bar where you can fill up as much as you'd like (I suggest the chunky mild red and the green sauce). One of my favorite treats is their churro; they don't skimp on the cinnamon and sugar, and they are fried to perfection.  

I order and pick up from here often, and they always get my order right. While it isn't necessarily expensive, I wouldn't say it is cheap either; expect to pay a decent amount. I prefer to pick up and take home because the atmosphere isn't very comfortable to eat in. 

If you want quick, fresh, and good seafood/mex Rubios is a great place!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon after going to the gym and found this place nearby. he ordered his favorite the 2 gourmet taco combo. (gourmet grilled shrimp, bacon & herb. Damn thats good!) and the steak. which is ok. (my 2nd fav. taco is the veggie ..and believe it or not I'm a steak lover burt I also love me some poblano & portabello mushrooms taco. (in soCal it was called poblano & portabello but in LV its called \"Veggie\".  I went w/ the grilled grande bowl. only 550 if you ask for it w/no dressing. and its gorgeous!!! I asked for the dressing on teh side and if you dip your fork into the dressing b4 ea. bite- you get less calories!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"this place is inside the Red rock casino's food court, get the 2 fish taco plate for $7.99, comes with pinto beans and chips, all taste pretty fresh..."}
{"text":"Best time to go here is on Tuesdays. The fish tacos are only $1.50 each! The fish is a generous size, and not a dinky taco that you would expect for the price. I usually order fish tacos along with chips to utilize the salsa bar. It gets pretty busy, so get ready to get comfortable. It took about 20 minutes to get my order of 5 fish tacos today."}
{"text":"The fish tacos and the cheese enchiladas are scrumptious. I have ordered here many times and have always had a consistently good experience. Nice portions. The price is very affordable, as well, compared to many other Mexican food joints."}
{"text":"Rubios has got to be one of my favorite fast food restaurants to grab a good fish taco.

The fish tacos I had were deep fried but the batter they use is what makes the tacos taste somewhat authentic and really close to the fish tacos I've had in Mexico.

The combination plate I ordered came with two fish tacos, a side of refried beans which I thought may have been a bit too refried as they had a border line soft crunchy texture which was not bad but nevertheless ov er fried. 

The combo also came with fresh tortilla chips which were really good and had nice crunch to them. This combo comes with a drink as well all for $12.00.

The service was really good as the gal at the register was very nice and respectful. Over all I would give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"An excellent choice in the Monte Carlo food court.  Good healthy choices for fair prices.

I tried the Classic Shrimp Burrito and it was really good.  Lots of fresh ingredients, including the always excellent avocado.  It was large enough that I ate only half of it and saved the other half for later.  Service was relatively quick.  And the extra chips on the side are always a bonus."}
{"text":"Rubio's is the king of fast food.  No matter what Rubio's I go to, I always get Mexifood so good that I can hardly believe that it's fast food at all.

This location is no different. . .no scratch that, it IS different--the customer service is the absolute bomb.  With our vegetarian habits, sometimes it is difficult for us to find food that we can eat in certain places.  Kimmie, who was the employee who waited on us, really helped us construct our meal, and even brought us salsa samples to try.

The food at this Rubio's location was as good at always, and the service made it that much better.  Count on more service from us at this place--thank you very much!  You made a very long and tiring day end on a good note."}
{"text":"Excellent Baja style mexican food to stay or go. The food is prepared well and very fresh ingredients and salsa bar...well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This location is a nice little spot, for when I really want a chicken bowl. Located near the Golds gym I see many protein needing people in here often, but theres always a few things that bother me here. The chicken bowl, its really really good...But the problem is, that its pricey. At about $10 a meal for something that might or might not fill you up, it might be a better bet to head to a more authentic Mexican place in the area."}
{"text":"I was super hot from spending the past 4 hours on Camelback Mountain and I just wanted something light and fresh.  Rubio's delivered with the amazing Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi taco.  I just had one and it was filling enough post hike and just super fresh with the right amount of sweet from the mango and kick from the habanero.  My boyfriend enjoyed his, but says he will get the mango habanero next time - it was that good."}
{"text":"I sure missed me some Rubio's while living in Texas for the past 4 years!

The restaurant chain as a whole is one of my favorites, but this location is just not up to par. I'm rating based on multiple visits, all having a consistent \"meh\" experience. I have zero issues with the food. It's still the delicious Rubio's that I expect. My office is walking distance away; I would love to come here more often, but just can't bring myself to do it.

The entrance leaves only enough room for 2-3 people to stand in line to order. And stand in line you will! Every time I have come here was during the lunch rush, and not once was there more than one person taking orders. You're forced to either block the entrance/exit or take the line outside (which is not desirable in the heat of the summer). Once you do finally reach the counter to place your order, consider yourself lucky if the employee even looks at you. Not once in 5+ times has anybody smiled and greeted me here, which I had come accustomed to when I worked over by the location on Tatum & Bell (5+ years ago). I have also never found an empty table that didn't require me grabbing a bunch of napkins to clean up so I can sit down.

I don't know if complaints have been rolling in, but my most recent visit was a little better. Tables still had some mess, but not nearly as bad. And the guy that brought me my food actually smiled and asked if I needed anything else.

I'm giving this 1 star for being Rubio's (I already said I like the chain) and 1 star for the hint and turning the service issues around recently. If it continues to improve I will re-visit my rating."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location several times, usually good service and good food. However there was something off last night. The kitchen staff were obviously irritated with each other. Alot of finger pointing and banter going on about how no one was doing anything and the kitchen was a mess. After waiting in line for several minutes, without being acknowledged, our order was taken. I get home and the burrito I ordered with steak, had no steak or guac. Just ALOT of rice and beans.....Not sure what happened last night but it seemed there was no leadership or communication."}
{"text":"The street tacos aren't worth the money. They give you a small handful of chips and a tiny side of beans. I'd recommend going with the burrito or something different. Pretty disappointed with the portion sizes especially when it comes to the chips! We were happy with the shrimp salad though. Very tasty shrimp!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to order here is the cheese quesadilla 
My grandma gets the chicken one we love them"}
{"text":"My family was on the west side of town yesterday and since we don't know that area quite as well we wanted to try a restaurant that had a track record, as we didn't want to take a chance on a local-owned shop.

I certainly wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is clean, as were the restrooms, and I loved the island theme - it give the place a coastal feel, which is nice if you live in Arizona!

I had some kind  of combo burrito that was good sized and gulped down every bite. I was in the restroom when my wife ordered for me, so couldn't comment on the friendliness of the staff."}
{"text":"I was strong armed into ordering lunch for a 25 person Inservice here by my Boss. There's a reason they pay him the big bucks! They not only made a whole lot of tasty food, everythings was made to order, LABELED, so you knew what you were eating, but also set me up with a box that divedes the utensils, plates and napkins, so they didn't get mixed up.
 They also delivered the food on a cart to my rather tiny car, and the guy CRAWLED in to make sure everything was balanced so it would fall.
 While I was waiting I asked if there was a pond store nearby. The lady behind the counter actually did an Internet search, and gave the directions and address. That;'s customer service. Much better than Pollo Loco, who said they only check their fax once a day and didn't know my order was on there last Inservice.
 I am a fan, I will use this Rubio's a LOT!"}
{"text":"My Mom loves the food, and they have Lobster right now! Getting my grub on, then hoping my headache goes away.
 The workers went WAY out of their way for us, even running next door because they were out of the drink my Mom wanted!
 The food was excellent, and the place was spotless. The decor is quirky, and there is always seating.
 I have never left hungry, and even though I think it's pricey it is always worth it once I get there."}
{"text":"This place has been here for the longest and I can't believe I haven't taken advantage of it being so close to home. Not only that I was looking for healthy food that was close to my place so maybe it'll be one of the place I frequently visit. Here it is \"FISH TACOS\"! If you don't like seafood, or sea fare well it's fine you can order something else off the menu, but as for me I go for the new 3 taco menu sampler. Can't get any better than the Original Fish Taco Beer Battered and so good."}
{"text":"I love all the food, shrimp burrito, fish tacos, shrimp tacos, soup, but the reason I don't guve it 5 stars is because they are really cutting back in their portions and their prices have gone up. Usually the fish tacos have the fish sticking out on both sides of the tortilla but on fish taco Tuesdays the piece of fish is about half the sizr barely covering the middle of the tortilla with an overload of cabbage, the same with the new lobster tacos mostly cabbage anf a few pieces of lobster! On the shrimp burrito it takes about three bites before you get a bite of shrimp. Now I think twice about going there with the family."}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty, in keeping with my other Rubio's experiences.  However, the portion sizes were absurdly small. There was about two level tablespoons of watery pinto beans, and the street taco was the smallest I've seen anywhere.

This Rubio's lacks the ambience (if you will) of some of their other locations.  The outside tables are extremely wobbly, and the music leaves a lot to be desired (perhaps due to budget issues). 

I'm able to tap out three stars, based on the flavorful food and friendly service.  If they boost the serving size up to that of anywhere else, fix some tables, and turn off the unknown music and play something known from within the past few decades, they'd get two more stars. :D"}
{"text":"Love Rubio's at home and was happy to see it at the hotel food court. Ended up stopping by for breakfast because I was in a hurry and there was no line. The bacon breakfast burrito was good, love their salsa. I wish it had potatoes in it. They didn't have decaf coffee which was a bummer, the Starbucks line was too long and I really wanted a cup of decaf."}
{"text":"I remember first trying Rubio's when I lived in Arizona 5 years ago, and dreamt of the amazing fish tacos when I moved back to Chicago. Now I'm back on the west coast, and the tacos are still as good as I remember. They've expanded the menu, but the fish tacos are still the best item on the menu"}
{"text":"Ordered the new mango avocado salad. With shrimp for $8.79. There's was 6 pieces of shrimp. Probably 1/4 of an avocado , 2tbs of mango sauce and 1/2 a cup of quinoa. The ingredient seems fresh. Restaurant called fresh Mexican grill with no taco salad? Sad. A bit pricy."}
{"text":"I LOVE their original fish tacos. The best fish taco I have ever had. That's the only thing I get there!! (Although I'm sure everything else is very tasty) 

The staff is always extremely nice. I know that I will always be taken care of when coming to Rubios!"}
{"text":"I do like the food at all Rubio's but the service at this location is just horrible!  So super slow and that hasn't changed in at least 5 years!!  Sigh!"}
{"text":"Dry, skimpy and tasteless.  Like shoe leather and expensive.  Skip it entirely and go to Chipotle across the freeway.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"One of the older food court venues, it has seen many restaurants come and go but this place remains. The denizens of Chandler mall have started to consume more fish. Even though there are other Rubios near by it stands to testament that this one still keeps. I recomend rubios having first discovered them in 2007. this location always brings back memories of happy shopping or sasiate my cravings for seafood and tacos. Everybody loves tacos and they have so much to offer from salsa Verde to grilled corn and fresh slices of avocado."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years! Love this place! Food is always consistent. I find the staff is always very pleasant and happy. Never had one problem in 10 years and we are foodies! Oh yeah, it's lobster season right now which is the best!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience here yesterday. I had a large order that I placed and I explained to the employee that we would be traveling with the food for an hour before we would be eating it. The staff did a great job packing everything up almost catering style. We had plenty of sauces and limes. Nothing was soggy because everything was packed separately. We really appreciated their efforts. Our dessert was forgotten which we stopped in for on the way home. My son said as soon as the staff member saw him she said \"I know what you're here for \" and apologized very sincerely and threw in an extra cake for us. I don't expect perfection. I expect 100% effort and when a mistake is made, own it, and make it better. I'm very happy with the food and the service I received."}
{"text":"Found this cute little spot by the movie theater. The people were super friendly, service was fast and food was too die for. Lucky me!"}
{"text":"Some new peeps joined our team today at work, so we decided to welcome them to the team by bringing them to lunch at Rubio's!  Heck, I go there a lot, I can't believe I haven't written a Yelp review yet.  

When you get in, your taken to a clean venue with an Islander feel.  The salsa bar has a thatched roof feel, lots of windows which offers a lot of sunlight and makes the place open up.  There's a self service soda bar for free refills on your drinks.  When you walk into the location, the order station is surely the focal point, with a huge menu behind it.  The staff is super helpful and super patient.  Heck, we had 15 different orders and he took the time to get our order correct!  I don't know his name because his name tag said Shrimp and \"Shift Leader.\"  He was super cool though!

For lunch, I got the Grilled Shrimp Seafood Burrito for $6.99.  I got the gourmet style which may have been an extra charge, but I didn't notice on the receipt.  The burrito is stuffed with seasoned shrimp, onions, cilantro, beans and cheese.  The gourmet style also includes:  bacon bits, avocado, Chipotle white sauce and rice.  When I think of \"gourmet,\"  My mind doesn't necessarily gravitate to bacon bits, but let me tell you, the burrito is awesome!  Every bite contained super flavorful shrimp.  The bacon bits were smokey and dispersed throughout the burrito as well.  The onions and cilantro offered a super light and crunchy texture and if you've ever read my past reviews, you would know that I LOVE avocado.  YUMMY!  This dish was also accompanied with homemade tortilla chips and salsa.  

The food is clean, the prices are affordable and the staff is on point.  Why wouldn't you want to visit this place!  Come check them out.  There's like 20 million locations city wide!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years, usually good food.  However, my past two visits have been less than satisfactory.  I ordered the fish taco especial plate both times.  My food was barely lukewarm, even though I do not need my food to be piping hot, I want it to be warmer than room temperature.  The beer-battered fish were mushy as well as not hot enough."}
{"text":"Rubio's is very average. I'm never really impressed with the meals that I get here and would much rather go to cafe Rio. I've tried their tacos and enchiladas and have always thought that both tasted very average and bland."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Cold and no taste. There were three of us and every entree was awful"}
{"text":"Came here for both lunch and dinner during a work trip to Vegas. It was a good healthy meal both times. I had their new Halibut Bowl and added shrimp for protein purposes. The place is reasonably priced and the fresh salsa option are also delicious. Would come back for a quick lunch next time around."}
{"text":"So... I kind of wish I had never tried this place. Only because I basically live across the street and am completely obsessed with their fish tacos- and obsessed is really an understatement. I know it's supposed to be a Tuesday thing- but I'm pretty sure I went to Rubio's like three times last week! 

My fav is the original fish taco. If you like gauc and really want to dress it up go for the fish taco especial. The staff is very kind, and I don't think I have ever waited longer than 4 minutes for my food- even on busy Taco Tuesday nights. 

If you are looking to grab some quick tasty food, try this place out. You surely won't be disappointed. Be warned--- fish tacos will consume your thoughts."}
{"text":"Great food fast.  Clean place.  Good service.  Try the shrimp burrito and fish tacos."}
{"text":"I am a huge rubios fan and prefer them over Chipotle. However rubios prices have been getting a bit too high.  They are over priced now just by a little bit.  However their food is fantastic and I love their chips and all their fresh made salsas to pick from.  Their restaurant is always very clean and comfortable to sit inside or outside.  I love their fish tacos too.  Their beans are never refried and I love their black beans too.  I wish they had a location a little closer to where I moved to but that's ok it's still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Ordered mango avocado salad and taco plate, wanted chips and guacamole and was told they don't have guac. Should remove it then as part of the \"specials.\" Paid with my card and after signing it and receiving the receipt, was then told by Wendy \"Just to let you know ahead of time that there would be a 20 minute wait.\" Really!? That is NOT ahead of time."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh. My beef is the lack of service from manager \"Julie\". Rude to customers and employees. They forgot my sons drink to go with his kids meal and typically when asking somebody a question,you would expect a response. She simply huffed, finished doing something, went and got the cup, brought it to table without a word. Nice.... I would never treat somebody with the lack of respect as she did. The entire visit left a sour taste in my mouth. That's the only reason for 3 stars. Would have given 4,but lousy customer service dropped this place down one."}
{"text":"Rubio's is pretty good.  They have good fish tacos, burritos and salads.  Their food does taste fresh, so they live up to their name (fresh mexican grill) and if you're looking for a cheap, fast lunch or dinner, this is it.

However, I haven't ever gone to their website to look at the nutritional content like I did with Baja Fresh, so at the moment, I can still enjoy their food without knowing just how many calories and fat grams they're loaded with."}
{"text":"This Rubio's location is pretty much like any other, except I saw a girl accidentally spill her soda into the salsa and pico de gallo and a person came from behind the counter to help her clean everything up.  BUT I never saw them change out the salsa or pico.  Sick.

Other than that, they have the standard fast food mexican fare, tostadas, burritos, quesadillas, tacos, rice bowls etc... and they're all pretty good.  I still like Baja better though."}
{"text":"I like their salsa, chips and prices. They put some sort of strange chemistry-made cheese substance in their burritos that is kind of gross - it tastes like a combo of cream cheese, american cheese and sour cream - everything tastes premade and slapped together - nothing tastes fresh. I have only been here twice, and prefer Chipotle's over this any day of the week!"}
{"text":"First timers. I enjoyed the food and the service was great. Girl at the register asked how everything was when we were done : ) 

I indulged in the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Chicken was fresh and the black beans were good too. Wasn't a huge fan of the rice. Just lacked a certain flavor for me. 

My husband got the chicken street tacos which were really good too. He added extra salsa from the salad bar because he loves his salsa. The tomatillo salsa was my absolute favorite. I added it to my enchiladas. It was perfect. I'll definitely eat here again : )"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Today was chaos. This place is always busy. They got order wrong. Didn't correct it and did not give a receipt so it was difficult to discuss.  Rubio's always has good and fresh food. Manager seemed to be back in the kitchen. So disappointing."}
{"text":"You go here for the Fish Tacos, period.  I much prefer the flour tortillas vs the corn, but thats me.  2 tacos is a good portion, and the service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Really good... enjoyed this spot while on my lunch break after doing some shopping. Good customer service and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos in Southern Nevada. Quality  food at a good price."}
{"text":"This review is mostly for Taco Tuesdays when a fish taco is $2 after 2:30. You'll find me there often! The size is big enough to fill me up & if I'm really hungry I add a small bag of chips. Then I really take advantage of the salsa bar & load up with fresh salsas.

Be sure to join their birthday club & receive a free entree during your birthday week. Thank you Rubio's!

P.S. Dear Rubio's: I would give you 5 stars if you had the taco special all day on Tuesday! LOL."}
{"text":"I ordered 11 tacos, they only gave us 10. So they either can't count or just genuinely don't care how many tacos you get in an order. They didn't even take the time to put the lime wedge in with the tacos. The whole experience just seemed like a lack of effort to satisfy a hungry dude who just wants 11 fish tacos..."}
{"text":"Garbage.  They spun out this inedible 'nachos' in no time flat with a scowl on their faces from the kitchen and incompetence from the counter. Horrible garbage 'food', never going back.   

Wtf am I supposed to do with that link dumbshit."}
{"text":"Stop it!! I can't believe this is my first time here!! Not only is every item appealing to my taste buds, but it also tastes amazing. But get this, not only does it taste amazing but their staff is incredibly nice!! This type of service and menu is not what I expected for Rubios \"fast food\". I got the salmon burrito I am very pleased, and have found my new hot spot and I can't wait to try all the other yummy-ness on their menu."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a die hard Rubios fan. It's been my favorite for years. I was excited to move closer to one after living hours away from the chain. And this location has been nothing but constant disappointment. ALL the front of house boys I have interacted with are terrible; super slow and EXTREMELY lacking customer service. I was the shift manager of a restaurant for 2 years and would be ashamed if my staff ever presented themselves like they did. And the WORST part about this Rubios (it's so small but so annoying) is the tea machines are ALWAYS mislabeled. You never know what you're getting. Needless to say, I will drive the extra mileage to a different Rubios so I don't have to go to this one. The food is always presentable though, minus getting stale chips half the time."}
{"text":"Customer service, food, atmosphere are all excellent. The food is always fresh and employees are constantly checking the lobby for cleanliness. The service is fast. I know I can look for consistently great experiences here"}
{"text":"What can I say about Rubio's besides I wish we had some in Ohio! You west-coasters have all the good food... By far the best fish taco we've ever had. Great prices and selection. I can't wait for another vacation!"}
{"text":"Shrimp burrito was so delicious!  Service was quick & food was fresh.  One of our favorite places to eat at this particular food court!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food for the price point... fast food... nice atmosphere at cetera very impressed for the money"}
{"text":"The food is incredible for it being a local chain. It's pretty fresh and free of heavy grease or oils. It's a nice way to get Mexican food without that heavy feeling in your stomach afterwords. The guys working the front weren't the most coherent, though. They aren't the best with customer service skills in an innocent way."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and excellent, fast service.  I confused the staff by asking to change how something on the menu is normally presented and it didn't matter.  They made it how I wanted it.

Music selection leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Eat here every once in awhile and always forget to give them a review. Delicious fish tacos. The fish is crispy and delicious. Nothing worse than getting a fried fish taco and it's soggy. Great salsa options too. Fresh tasting food."}
{"text":"Wow, we love this place!I can't believe how good the salsa is. A very good selection of hot and mild sauces. The tacos are excellent. My personal favorite though is the bean burrito. Easily a full meal with their chips on the side.  The prices are affordable. I've never had a bad experience here with either the food our with the employees. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've tried just about everything Rubios has to offer. I have liked everything, but my favorite is the fish taco. The service is good, but the tacos, mmmmboy!"}
{"text":"People let me tell ya bout Rubios! It's just fine.
When you're tired of Chipotle you've got another option for mediocre fast causal place that servers what Americans think Mexican food is.
This place is cool and the gang because they have good seafood choices. 
This particular place was extra awesome because of the smoking hot Latina manager working the Jewish piano. I said damn dropped the gat from my hand. She had some cool tats on her arm and checked ALL the boxes. 
Anyways, like I said. When Chipotle wears thin come here and dig in!"}
{"text":"We placed an order online for pick up. When I showed up at Rubio's, the cashier informed me that they only have small tortillas instead of the large ones. I said those were fine. We ordered chicken quesadillas but somehow ended up with cheese quesadillas. It is wrong to spend money and didn't what we ordered"}
{"text":"Just about as good as it gets, but their prices are getting a little steep.  $2.79 for fish taco $2.99 fish especial I can understand but $1.99 for those teeny weeny street tacos so delicious to my taste buds?  We calculated and it's $.66 per bite 'cuz you only get 3 per taco.  Good thing they frequently have coupons for their email beach club and always a free meal for your birthday, what a GREAT bonus, I love that!  (PS) make the lobster burrito a permanent fixture, will ya?  And get a stupid kids meal toy for my bratty kid, she's tired of just crayons...  Just kidding...  :)"}
{"text":"Bomb as hell love the lobster burrito the tortilla chips are entirely legit. The Carne taco is also incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic food lower priced the f*** it I think the lobster burritos are going to get me laid."}
{"text":"Really good place but service has gone downhill tremendously since they got rid of Cat!! Bring her back!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, orders are fresh and the food is always good. My main critique however is that they make more of an effort to clean the place. Every time we come here we have a hard time finding a clean table. Not only are they not wiped down, the look as though they could use a deep cleaning as well."}
{"text":"This review is based on several visits here in the last couple months and in particular yesterday. The counter girl was just plain rude and bitchy. Her coworker even noticed and tried to lighten the mood with no luck. A word of advice, if you don't like people, go find a job where you're not customer facing.  The food was good, once they got our order right. This was the 3rd time in 4 trips here our order was wrong. All I asked for was no cilantro, not too complicated.  Also, the men's restroom was overflowing all the way past the salsa bar. This place needs help."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping here for a late lunch from time to time. Are usually get the chopped salad with blackened oh no fish on it. The food is very fresh. The people are very friendly and the setting is clean. If you eat in the meal is served on real plates or bowls and they use real silverware. Something you would not find other \"fast food\" restaurant. They have a wonderful salsa bar with a variety of salsas. And I like the fact they have three different types of ice teas to choose from, all made fresh."}
{"text":"I love the attitude of the employees there ,the food is cooked fresh and even the cooks have a great personality and you can tell care about your experience . I wish the customer service level in every restaurant was at this level!!!"}
{"text":"I think I may have been a little harsh in my previous judgment of Rubio's. Yes, it's not the most authentic Mexican food and yes, it's a chain, but I went there today and tried their veggie burrito with a whole wheat tortilla and it was pretty tasty and not too heavy. I definitely prefer Baja Fresh and Chipotle (coming soon to 24th St and Baseline center) for Mexican chains, but Rubio's has some ok offerings if you choose carefully."}
{"text":"Solid, decent prices, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Love Rubio's. The flavour, quality and price is hard to beat. The fish batter is always crispy and the fish tender. One of our favourites."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service here. I mostly go for Taco Tuesdays. There is never a long wait to order or to get your food. Place is clean, salsa bar is always neat and well stocked. I love sitting outside when it's warm, overall a good casual place to relax and have some tasty grub."}
{"text":"I kinda am obsessed with fish tacos..so I feel like I know what a good fish taco is.. And these are just okay. We came on taco Tuesday so they were only 1.50$... I would never pay 3.00$ for them. 

It's decent food..but it isn't loaded with flavor or made very well. Seems kinda slapped together and overpriced. That's all"}
{"text":"Every single Rubio's we have tried has been clean with wonderfully fresh food and pleasant service. My only complaint about Rubio's is we can not get this on the East Coast! You need to bring them to Long Island, New York as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Food is always Awesome!! However Jacob the guy behind the counter is totally obnoxious and really needs to stop yelling \"Soliders\" while people are trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I had lunch with coworkers here on a Thursday. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito. It had flavor and was filling, but it seemed a little expensive (more expensive than Chipotle), and in hindsight, I probably should have gotten a salad. The place was busy but not crowded. Service was quick, accurate, and friendly. The tables and salsa bar were clean and organized. It's not hard to find and parking is easy. They specialize in fish tacos, so that's probably the best bet for fish-eaters. Rubio's tries to market itself or seems to have a reputation as a somewhat healthy option, but that of course depends on what you order. My grilled veggie burrito had 770 calories according to their website's nutrition facts. Not terrible, but I also had some chips and salsa (they came with it free!), so not something I'm going to do everyday. I considered giving it four stars, but it seemed a little expensive, and it wasn't the best food I've ever had. Portions were big, but overall I think I prefer Chipotle."}
{"text":"I did not find the girls to be friendly or patient with me as a new customer. I do however like Rubio food so we will probably stick to ours."}
{"text":"Food is good and they have a great variety of soft drinks including diet ones.  I really appreciate that. The staff is very nice and I appreciate good customer service.  It's also a nice place to dine either in or outside.  The salsa bar has a very nice variety of items s well."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. I haven't been here in years and I wanted something better than Taco Bell but didn't want Chipotle. Well I should have chose of of those. Everything I ordered was bland including the salsa and guacamole. And my churro was cooked twice so it tastes like grease instead of cinnamon and sugar."}
{"text":"So sad to give a 2 star review to one of my reliable Fish Taco fixes.  

Unfortunately while the cashier was super nice and sweet, the fish tacos were dripping in grease.  Inedible, and I was starving!  My son and I were only able to eat not quite half of a fish taco.  Terrible.  

Luckily the Langostino taco was yummy.  Unfortunately, my hubbys grilled salmon tacos were too dry, so literally one taco out of 5 was good.  And we paid $34 for 3 half eaten entrees.  

Big fail Rubios, Las Vegas.  Big letdown. 

On another note, all the CA Rubios have been solid.   Run to a CA Rubios... this one, stay away."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Rubio's on a Friday night. They were training a new employee and everyone was friendly. I got the fish taco especial which is fried fish with guacamole, delicious, tasty, with a light crunch. I will definitely be back since I'm not eating meat on Fridays during Lent."}
{"text":"Rubios is yummy but the staff here is a model for good, friendly service.  They always make you feel welcome and go above and beyond to make your time there pleasant."}
{"text":"Knock out catering for large doctors offices!!! Always delicious, healthy, on time with rave reviews from office staff and doctors who attend. Todd bends over backwards to make sure everything is perfect and you can contact him in the middle of the night and he'll do his best to make it happen. Well maybe not the middle of the night but I've texted him at 8:30 at night and he's been supremely helpful!"}
{"text":"I gotta say I wasn't expecting this place to be this good. I read a news article about how this place is up-and-coming so I decided to give it a try. I had the Baja Burrito with grilled chicken. The flavor was incredible. The grilled white meat chicken was nice and juicy and the cilantro & tomato salsa adds another element of flavor. Be sure to add one of their four or five salsas from the salsa bar. My favorite is the green citrus sauce that was in a squeeze bottle. It's nice and tangy. 

Don't miss out on the fish tacos either. There's plenty of fish in it so you don't have to worry about fishing to get some fish in every bite. Their white sauce and cabbage smothered on top adds the creaminess and crunch that every fish taco should have. I'm already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Clean tables and floor. Outdoor seating. Tasty fish tacos. Great place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"ONLY reason why I'm giving 4 stars it's because of the ancho citrus shrimp burrito , that was amazing!! It has avocado in it, rice beans , and there was a lot of shrimp!:) 


However the cashier was hoooooorrible! Instead of her saying hi how are you or anything I was the one to ask her how she's doing today. Her attitude was disgusting but humorous to watch . Lol"}
{"text":"They're fine. A bit slow. The folks that take the orders are really nice and friendly.  They do have one chef who works at a paint store. Sometimes when I come in he is cooking but a number of times I've been there, he is in a filthy paining uniform and standing next to the kitchen drinking a soda and chit chatting with the cooks. Truth be today if he's not working, he should not be near the food. As for the food, it's really good. My family loves the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"We saw an employee place a dish rag on the trash area then use it to wipe down the salsa and drink surfaces and tables.  She also touched the dirty dishes.  She then served customers their food without washing her hands. Will not be back.  Call the health department!

And - get rid of those gross dishes.  Why should I have to scrape my plate when I'm done eating?"}
{"text":"Always the fish tacos on Taco Tuesday!!! Super cheap and super delicious!!!! Plus the cashier is such a sweet woman :) I come back every week!"}
{"text":"I have been here many, many times over the years but yesterdays visit is what prompted the review.  First let me say I love the food here and would come more often it they were in the direction that I travel often so they usually are just a treat for me.  While doing errands and after Christmas shopping this was the perfect spot for a light lunch.  I forgot to tell them no bacon on my food and when I took it back up I apologized, said it was my fault and I would pay for new tacos but they took it and made me fresh food with no bacon at no charge. Super nice about it, no attitude that you usually get when you take food back.   I read the other reviews about cleanliness and although I wasn't looking for it directly it all appeared clean to me.  All of table were clean and the drink area and salsa bar was all clean and stocked."}
{"text":"The manager: Kat was super friendly... You can appreciate, I can at least someone that is upbeat and nice at any place of business that deals with the public all the time.  
This is a great location, even the employees seemed in good spirits and talkative.  
I cannot complain about a happy work environment here.  The food tasted fresh and the location was clean and in order.  I plan on visiting the staff here again.  This has to be my favorite Rubios.  If you like fish tacos, try the salmon taco, lots of flavor...."}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos!  Good value on Tuesdays with $1.50 tacos. I also feel the staff consistently is upbeat, and provides very good service."}
{"text":"It was alright. We sat on the patio so getting things like napkins/forks/salsas was a pain because they don't have little trays available to carry all of that on. When they brought out our food, it was already getting cold. It was a pretty expensive lunch (Yes, I'm aware it is sustainably sourced and all) for a few tacos and a couple of drinks. They have replaced the Mahi with Ono which doesn't seem to offer up the same great flavor. My especial taco would have been better if still hot and crisp. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I love the chopped salad here.  Also a big fan of the especial burrito & the enchiladas.  The cashier Eva was such a sweetheart.  Super friendly & helpful!  I will definitely be visiting this location again. Great service.  Clean location"}
{"text":"The service here is always friendly. Called ahead and my food was ready as soon as I walked in the door. Highly recommend the California bowl with chicken! Very tasty."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience. Salmon and tilapia taco and the refried beans were very bland! Not usual for Rubio's so I was dissatisfied. The gourmet shrimp taco was excellent. Cheese, bacon and salsa and the well seasoned shrimp blended extremely well. Another positive was that the soda fountain station housed Vanilla Coke which is rare for restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service not good. Order taker was not friendly and when I asked about the beans and chips not coming with my taco meal he simply said my meal doesn't come with those sides. However, the menu clearly states it does. Coke Zero was also out. Again, food was delicious and tasted fresh. Luckily, my home Rubio's isn't this one so I'll be getting better service at my normal spot."}
{"text":"Went to Red a rock Casino for 4th f July fireworks and hoped to get BBQ At Lucille's but the wait was way to long, over 2 hours, so we headed over to the food court and decided on Rubio's. The shrimp tacos were delicious, fresh shrimp with a mild creamy salsa. Add hot salsa to it and wow! What a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos!  Visiting the restaurant in Goodyear.  Lots of parking space available with available outdoor seating.  Restaurant was spacious and well lit.  Staff were friendly.  Service was prompt.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Loved their sauce bar where you can help yourself to their various hot sauces.  Particularly like the variety in the menu with fish options!  Definitely will be back to try it all."}
{"text":"Where to begin hmmm...great food, reasonable prices, very clean dinning area, super friendly staff.  Also, they have whole grain tortillas and veggie meal options (the veggie burrito is to die for), and a selection of beers and other spirits, and very delicious mango tea."}
{"text":"I will start off saying food good salsas great but the staff I can't put in to words about their attitudes it was national burrito day not worst mean day those are things that turn me away from here even if the food is good I will give it one more shot at a different location put a happy face on for once"}
{"text":"Ashley, Miranda, and Lupe are amazing! Restaurant was clean and super busy! Didn't wait long for my shrimp tacos! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"If I'm going for fast food Mexican it's going to be Rubio's; the ingredients are good quality and I've never had an order go wrong. They also do really good party platters if yummy, but not fancy is what's required. I used to eat at this location A LOT in the early 2000s, but those were my fast food days long gone. Rubio's is still the only FF place that I have not eliminated in the past 10-15 yrs."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. Between a shrimp burrito or the original fish tacos I always have fresh and accurately prepared meals, can't say the same for other \"faster food\" locations. I however find it weird when they invite me to the salsa bar but what am I meant to eat with the salsa while I wait for my food? Wish you got chips before your meals."}
{"text":"The employees were friendly. I had 3 steak tacos and a bottle of Coke, my friend had 2 fish tacos... $29. Did you hear me? $29 bucks. Now that's bad but the steak on my tacos was dried out, burnt...I actually had to pull some out of my mouth because it was hard and tasted like charcoal. The tortillas were heavy and chewy. This was my first Rubios meal and last, I don't know if it's just this location or just a bad cook but I'm not willing to gamble $29 to try again. If I wasn't with a friend I would have tossed this meal into the trash and went to McD's or Jack."}
{"text":"The food was good but for expecting fast service I was a bit disappointed. The cashier was sweet but this place just seemed very understaffed and it took a bit for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Fish taco, shrimp taco... yeh, I love it! But if the shrimp is not fried will be much better! I just don't like fried seafood."}
{"text":"This was my first time at rubios. I try not to eat chain foods but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with my meal. The staff was very friendly and patient as I explored my options. I of course got an original fish taco which was ah-mazing. The restaurant was clean and well lit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Rubio's is my favorite Hispanic chain, but the one here was really disappointing. Not sure if I just went on a bad day, or what, but I'm not sure I'll give them a second shot. The burrito didn't taste fresh and seemed like it was sitting there for a while, and this is between the time I got it at the counter, walked about 30 steps, sat down and took my first bite. 

Did talk to the cashier about it, and they offered to remake it, which they did but then, they botched the order and made it something entirely different. 

Only reason they didn't get a 1* was because you could tell the cashier was actually sorry about the mix-up/issue, so props for that. Maybe I'll stop by if she has been promoted."}
{"text":"I'm a 'menu walker' whenever I have the opportunity to go somewhere repeatedly. Over the past several years, the menu at Rubio's has undergone some churn, but the standards are still around. The fish tacos are inexpensive and great -- I prefer the 'especial' version, which cost a bit more for ...

This one is above average due to the staff and they should be commended; always fast, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp tacos combo that had bacon and some type of amazing sauce on it. Happy tummy. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Manager was very nice and service was awesome! This location was Very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"This is the best Rubio's in the whole Valley. The food actually tastes better. Lorena, the manager is awesome. She makes everyone feel like welcome family. I also admire how she interacts with her staff. You can tell there is a lot of mutual respect and affection. Altogether a good energy place. My favorite!"}
{"text":"Solid fish tacos, good salsa bar. Had the three taco dealio with a shrimp, tilapia, and original fish. Yum! The lad was impressed with the original plate. Great \"unfried\" beans."}
{"text":"For a place that has a very chain-like feel, this quick restaurant was a great surprise! Very delicious, with bold flavors in the gourmet tacos (bacon is always a plus!) and the enchiladas were good too. 
The family loved the salsa bar, which has lots of choices. Service was good"}
{"text":"The food tastes great and I like that it's always quality. What stops me from giving a higher rating is their customer service as well as how long it takes for them to make two tacos when there is no line and very few customers in the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Manager Nathan was really friendly and helped with all our requests and did it w a smile. Location is very clean. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We (my son and I) love Rubios - for a fast food chain, they are excellent. Food always good, quick and reasonably priced. As someone with food allergies and sensitive to food quality, I can tell they use quality ingredients and they have lots of options for me to order. Love their grilled fish tacos, CA bowls, tortilla soup and street tacos."}
{"text":"Although the staff was hustling, it was 35 minutes to get our food. And it was cold...... They need to make sure that there's MORE staff at dinner hour.  Had been ok with this location before this time...."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, nice staff and delicious food! I like that it's chicken and steak are all natural. I'm into healthy eating and I like coming here."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's. I've never had a complaint at any of their locations. Clean restaurants. Good food. Friendly employees. Amber at this location is especially friendly and goes out of her way to ensure your experience is top notch. 
Their Tuesday fish taco deal is awesome. $1.50 after 2:30 pm."}
{"text":"Just as good as any other Rubio's I've been too. The staff is usually friendly and establishments are kept clean. I'm addicted to their fish tacos, but I'll try something different every now and then. I've never been disappointed. Always fresh and fast."}
{"text":"Haven't been in for a while, but I had to get one of their new Smoky Red Chile Hand Battered Shrimp Tacos...it was really good. The sauce is sweet with a hint of heat, very nice. Had to get a Fish Taco as well, always a favorite of mine. Love their Chipotle salsa. Staff is always friendly, helpful. I think their food is worth the price, I'd rather eat here than a fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"Boy has this place gone downhill. It's now the Carls Jr of Mexican Food.  Not quite the Mcdonalds as that would be of course reserved for Taco Bell. 

Pretty much all their salsas are boring and bland. Hot salsa tastes like marinara sauce.

High school cashier employee forgot our chips and drinks. Then told me to wait while she proceeded to greet and help another customer. Had to get the bus boy to get them for us.

Carls Jr actually has better street tacos than this. Though not by much, they are about equal. Rubio's puts guacamole on theirs  by default. Who puts guacamole on a taco?

Fish tacos were okay as usual. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! Original fish taco for $1.50. My favorite is the corn flour tortilla. 

You can also order the two taco combo that comes with beans for the discounted price.

The hot sauce gives the tacos an extra kick of flavor. 

You don't want to miss out on this weekly special!"}
{"text":"I normally love Rubio's. We don't have them on the east coast so I was excited to find one in Vegas. Unfortunately the fish tacos had me sick all night and I lost half a day of vacation in the bathroom"}
{"text":"Had the Baja Grill steak burrito this time. Cooked perfect and the guacamole was great. Employee Paris was wonderful and went out of her way to make sure I was doing ok."}
{"text":"Been going to Rubios since the chain came to town in the late '90s.  It continues to go downhill.  The food portions are quite a bit smaller than they used to be and the prices have headed the other direction.  The flavors aren't particularly bad, they just aren't much.  Rubios is a step above Taco Bell, but the step is getting smaller all the time."}
{"text":"Manager and her employees are rude, and could pretty much care less about any sort of customer service. 

Burnt my food and I had to wait around for approx 20 minutes for them to remake my food. 

Have had much better experiences at other Rubios. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in all of NW Vegas.  My absolute fave item on the menu is the blackened salmon burrito. In my humble opinion this is the most yummy-licious item they offer.  Bonus - every entree item comes with chips.  And while you wait for your order there is a salsa bar that you can help yourself to."}
{"text":"Always love Rubio's! The California bowl with shrimp is so good. Get it with extra lettuce. They are happy to tweak your order to your liking. All the ingredients seemed fresh and service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Rubio's is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants and I have tried out a lot of them! Their dishes are a perfect combination of delicious and healthy! I usually get their California bowl and I add shrimp! It's looks, smells and tastes amazing and I don't feel guilty after I eat it lol highly recommend the place for a great and healthy lunch! Also, their staff is very friendly and kind"}
{"text":"Not the Rubio's I knew in San Diego, but not bad. The sauce was different from the yogurt-based sauce I remember, and the fish had a thicker coating of batter than I remember. Good service. Clean place."}
{"text":"YASSSS this place was the bomb!! I woke up craving shrimp tacos and didn't want to go just anywhere to get them and risk a tummy ache. The staff here was very patient with me in explaining the menu items and the food didn't take too long to prepare either. My boyfriend is a self-proclaimed Mexican food expert and even said this place is better than most. I had the Gourmet pan seared shrimp tacos and was satisfied by the end of the meal. The meal in terms of price was a bit expensive, our meal altogether was pretty basic and it ended up costing $20. But overall I had a good experience and will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This location is always quick and I like how they open a little earlier then most places. This was a perfect place for a mid morning lunch before heading around errands. The people are friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Rubios locations. The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathrooms. The salsa bar is always fully stocked and everything always looks and tastes fresh. All utensils, napkins and straws are always stocked too. The staff is very pleasant and the food is always out fast. One of my favorite dishes is the chopped salad. Something about the combination of lettuce and cabbage is so good in a salad. Sometimes I add a little bit of the mild salsa on my salad and it's so good!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me here once after we went climbing and I fell IN LOVE with their fish tacos. Great place!"}
{"text":"14 years ago after moving to Las Vegas, this was a place we thought had some good fish taco's but we had so many other places to eat, we had't returned. Today, on this side of town I thought I'd try it again. 

I got the costal trio, Original Fish Taco, Salsa Verde Shrimp Taco and Regal Spring Tilapia Taco. The shrimp and fish taco's was good, fresh, crispy with crunch, however, the tilapia was a little fishy smell, it turned me off. 

I like their choices, you can mix and match and the have a fresh salsa bar. And i love the fresh mango tea!"}
{"text":"Rubio's is one of my favorite restaurants for healthy and fresh food at reasonable prices!   I enjoy their grilled fish entrees and fresh made salsa.  The menu has something for everyone from burritos, tacos to salads - all really tasty! I have visited different locations of Rubio's and there is always consistency in food quality - wish there were a Rubio's in Prescott Az.!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The two chicken taco meal is my favorite. The place is always clean and usually quite when I go in. If you go in to order it usually takes under 10 minutes so I give the place props for the speedy cooking and short wait time."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience. First no silverware, salsa bar was half empty and nothing looked fresh. Lots of dirty dishes. My wife got her food I had to wait on mine."}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's also super fresh and delicious and worth the wait. I don't get to frequent it as often as I like, but when I do go here I end up craving it again a few days later. 

However, the staff here always seems to be upset or angry. Yesterday I went to claim my free birthday meal, and I asked the cashier a question to make sure I was ordering something covered by the coupon. She rolled her eyes at me, and responded as if I should have known the answer (which I didn't, because I don't frequent Rubio's very much.) Then I told her that since the coupon covered that meal, I would get it. She sighed, and stuck her hand out for my phone so I could give her the coupon.

It was a bit insulting and put a damper on the meal. I am giving it a three star rating because: 1) the ancho citrus shrimp burrito was delicious and 2) the chef who brought me my food was super friendly, and almost made up for the cashier's sour attitude.

I will return to Rubio's, just not this location."}
{"text":"They don't take coupons anymore and their entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I get that it's in a touristy spot, but the ingredients they use are mediocre. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I just yelled at a kid (8 y/o approximately) that I saw stick his finger in the salsa to taste it. 

Felt obligated to tell the staff because you'd assume they would immediately toss it out. It's contaminated! You all know where kids stick their fingers. It's usually not good. I go to the counter, approach a man named Chris with dark rimmed glasses and quietly let him know. He thanks me and I sit back down. Then I watch him do nothing. He tells no one. He continues to take orders. So, that's that I suppose. Booger-butt salsa for everyone! Weee!"}
{"text":"I am personally a pretty big fan of Rubios.  I get the same two items every time I go.  California bowl with chicken and Verde sauce, with a chicken gourmet taco.  Mmmmm deliciousness.  I am a frequent visitor to this location as I live nearby."}
{"text":"I love it here!  The location by my sister's house closed in north Phoenix and when she told me about it, I immediately had a craving for Rubio's and was so thankful that this location is still open and appears to be going strong!  I would eat here every day and I'm pretty sure wouldn't even ever get tired of it!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are delicious. They have good unsweetened mango tea. The manager and employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"Took my sister in law here tonight for her birthday. I am allergic to fish....I am careful to let restaurants know when I go out. I let the young lady at the front know right after I gave her my order. I was met with an \"ooookay\" and given a good 10 second stare. Other locations have been wonderfully accommodating. As soon as we sat down the cashier and her fellow coworker were staring at us for a good 5 minutes. I don't know if there was any training for this kinda thing. Because my eyes are now swollen, my throat is itchy, and my head is killing me....Good thing I'm not DEATHLY allergic."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday I stop in for the fish taco special. For the past few years, the manager Juan has always greeted me and takes great care of the customers.   He is why I keep coming back.  This week he was gone and it was a mess.  People waiting with lines out the door.  The cashier's had little or no experience and the wait times for orders were 20 min or more.  Bring Juan back and let him run this location like it's supposed to be run."}
{"text":"Just finished eating dinner here and it was terrific! Wonderful service with delicious food. Quick, easy and yummy...Rubios is one of my favorite places! My favorite is gourmet shrimp tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Place is clean, food is tasty, and it's priced right. You just have to be careful and check out their nutrition facts online, b/c some of their 'fish taco's are loaded with fat.

You could eat a burger, fries, and a milk shake for the same 'fish taco meal'.

But they have tons of condiments and there's never a line."}
{"text":"Great fast food order at the counter establishment. Very clean. I love their fish tacos and Mahi Mahi burritos. Rubio's never disappoints. They have fat free refried beans and they are so delicious. They also have a great salsa bar with fresh and yummy salsas. We love their $1.99 fish taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I love this place but today was not good. Maybe it's my fault for going so late at night. We got there like 9 pm. The original fish taco was hard and mostly crunchy batter and no fish.  Plus I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and that was the worst part. It was basically rice in chicken broth.  Not 1 single piece of chicken. I love me some chicken tortilla soup but this was not good at all. And idk why you would get flour tortillas with tortilla soup. I'm so used to corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Brought family  here from the midwest where they dont have Rubios.. They loved it.  The gourmet tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice enough when I came in and I love Rubio's food...a lot but the portion size at this location was pretty small. Not sure why but all the meals I saw coming out of the kitchen were being skimped on. Either way, same great taste as any other Rubio's."}
{"text":"Very solid fish taco, friendly staff, and the location is perfect as it's right by the shopping area.  I have yet to order anything else because their fish tacos are so good."}
{"text":"Our morning at work consists of Getting set up and preparing for the daily business prior to opening our doors and a few other small things. But most importantly we have to all come to Agreement on what to eat for lunch.. Well today we had a tough time figuring it out but the underlying theme was Mexican. Someone shouted Chipotle, then someone shouted, \" Ugghhhhh, are you serious?\" Then From the other side of the building you hear a faint, \" Baja Fresh\", and again you hear, \" What? Are you kidding me?\" and finally someone suggested Rubios and there was a moment of silence and  the tension in the room Mellowed and the calmness of Agreement was among us. 

We all put our orders down and I chose to devour a Veggie burrito. Veggie Burrito? You ask... Yep, Portabellos, peppers, beans, rice, and a nice kick to the hot salsa i had them add. Once the order arrived in our office we all headed back to the lunch table like a heard of Lions to a large................. salad..... Okay i know lions don't eat salad but just in case you are reading this as a bedtime story to your kid i did not want to say we headed to them like lions on zebra.. Moving on. The Burrito was plentiful, and they did not skimp on the portabello which i have to be honest I was expecting. This thing was stuffed like a thanksgiving burrito and was really really filling. Everyone elses food looked great and smelled great as well. I now think that this is going to be moved a little closer to the top of our lunch picks for the future feasts. 

If you have not been here, and are in a hurry and like Veggies i would recommend trying out the Veggie burrito that they execute with perfection."}
{"text":"I finally realized I was addicted to the shrimp burritos when I dreamed about eating one.......if loving a burrito is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

PS - If the Big D does not open a Rubios soon, I may have to consider relocating."}
{"text":"Ah....June.  Happy Birthday to me!  I started to get all my \"free birthday emails\" last week, and decided to use one of them today at Rubios.  Sign up for their E-Club, and the week before/after your birthday, you get a free entree with purchase of a drink.  Score!  

Drove down, went inside, showed my coupon on my phone, purchased my drink for about $3.00, and was all set.  I decided to go with the Shrimp and Bacon Burrito with no chipotle sauce.  I got my number, my drink, and took a seat outside (decent sized seating area inside, but like everything near Arrowhead, PACKED...always!).  The lady brought out my plate with my burrito and some chips on it.  Here is how it was...............

Shrimp and Bacon Burrito-  Doesn't that just sound delicious?  Shrimp and bacon?  Hell to the yes!   This burrito was packed with flavor!  It had shrimp, bacon, guacamole, jalapenos, rice, cheese and salsa in it!  It was delicious!  There were probably 10 shrimp in it!  The flavors meshed very well, and the jalapenos gave it some sneaky heat!  The cheese was like a fried cheese crisp almost.  Great texture, and good flavor!  Fresh guacamole, perfectly cooked rice and and overall, it was pretty fat!  I don't know if I would pay the regular price for it ($8.99), but for free??  Shit yes!  This burrito was delicious!

Overall, I was stoked that Rubios hooks it up for your birthday!  Very kind of them, and I appreciated it.  The burrito was delicious, service was friendly, and it only cost me less than $3.00. Score!  I would definitely come back to this Rubios for another burrito and/or their fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Well, a fish taco craving hit the other day.  What to do?  Go to Rubio's (since it was Tuesday and all), right?

Decided that I wanted some fish tacos, stat!  Drove down to this location because it's not too far from home (closest Rubio's to my house) and was just off my path on the drive home from work.  I walked in, ordered 2 regular fish tacos on corn tortillas (no white sauce) and 2 fish taco especials on flour tortillas (no white sauce).  Total was just over $8.00 (On Tuesdays, regular tacos are $1.75 and especial tacos are $2.00).  Took them out to my car to dig in.  Here is how they were..................

Regular Fish Taco-  Rubios makes a pretty damn good fish taco.  They give you a decent sized piece of fried fish inside a corn tortilla, and top that with some cabbage and their red salsa.  They even include a lime in there.  Taco was delicious!  The red sauce and cabbage pair well with the crispy fried fish.  Their tortillas aren't my favorite in the world, but they still are passable.  For $1.75, hell of a deal!

Fish Taco Especial-  I got these ones on flour tortillas.  Same ingredients as the regular fish taco, but these have a little bit of cheese and guacamole on them.  I prefer the flour tortillas here over the corn ones.  They have a better chew and hold the ingredients a little bit better.  Same great taste...crispy fish, cabbage, red sauce and the addition of cheese and guacamole made them a little more creamy with a different texture.  If you like cheese and/or guacamole, for the extra $.25, it's well worth it.

Overall, I liked my tacos!  Service was incredibly friendly, and the price was right.  I don't crave fish tacos often, but if I do in the future, I will head back to this Rubios."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. First place I stop to eat when I'm in Vegas. Loving the fish tacos. . They are over stuff with the ingredients which I like..  if there add the chipoltesauce on top it's two die for...."}
{"text":"The Original Fish Tacos never disappoint. Fish is light and flaky and so is the batter. I least order them with a flour tortilla instead of corn tortilla. Thy have a salsa area with limes, lemons, cilantro/onion mix, and various salsa options. On tuesdays, the fish tacos are $1.75 each-can't beat that."}
{"text":"Not a bad joint to get your fish taco fix, but this is not a place that'll have you chomping at the bit to return, until you just have to have another fish taco.  Stale tortilla's and chips kind of dilute the experience a tad, but they are edible, tasty, and convenient."}
{"text":"I live nearby this Rubio's on 24th St and Baseline Rd in south Phoenix.  I have lived in this area since 2007, and I have frequented this Rubio's regularly and often during this time.  I like the Rubio's menu, and I can always find something to order that is appealing.  The large staff needed to keep a business open like this 7 days a week has been invariably knowledgeable, cheerful and diligent about their work all these years -- they work very hard to do their best at a very challenging goal for an always open restaurant to be their best all the time -- try going back often and see if you don't agree with me !!  Wes Flinn"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to this particular location, 2 of the 3 times it was an unpleasant experience. Although the food is great the staff not to competent. I call and place my order over the phone for pick up. 1st time i placed the order after a 14hr work shift i show up the lady said,\"im sorry i forgot to place it\" today i call ahead i was placed on hold for 22 minutes & 16 seconds and only to hangup after i showed the manager/supervisor my phone hold time. Might i add i walked in and waited 4 minutes at the counter while 1 woman moved chairs and no other customers at the counter. I got a \"im sorry we must have been busy thats why we didn't come back to the phone\" yet, like i previously mentioned no customers were waiting and the staff was moving chairs. 
This will be my last time at this location..."}
{"text":"Good food, good salsa choices.  The fish taco's were really good.  Just wish they could have come baked, broiled or grilled in place offried.  Still, very yummy."}
{"text":"Good fish tacos & lobster burritos!  They also take Apple Pay now which is so easy and secure!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and always good!  Not much you can say, but always, always very tasty!  The people that work there makes it a special place too!"}
{"text":"Great find for a delicious and filling lunch! 
Check in before you check out (there may or may not be an offer) 

Super clean and semi friendly staff!  
Tons of fresh options and salsa bar too. 

I will totally go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Okay it's not a secret that I love fish tacos. And Rubios has the best in my opinion. This is located in the food court of the Red Rock. I got the 2 original fish taco plate coming with beans and chips. The only unremarkable part of my visit was the beans. They're beans. Meh. The tacos were freshly made with crispy but juicy fish. The chips and salsa are amazingly adducting. And the service... That's what making me write this review. While waiting for the food the person who took my order was extremely friendly and made conversation pointing me in the right direction when I was trying to find a grocery store or CVS or something along those lines. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time around August last year and sadly haven't been back since. But I've been craving fish tacos and for some reason thought today was their special ($1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays) but discovered it is Tuesdays they do it. I got their trio with an original fish taco, salsa verde shrimp taco,and a tilapia taco. Also some chips cuz I love their salsa (the green tomatillo is best) I enjoyed it payed little over $10 after tax. Don't care for the price so the $1.50 is probably the best day to come especially cuz their original fish taco is in my opinion the best. I'll be back. Great service there and they sell their salsa $5 for a 12oz cup."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the chicken chop salad. 97% lettuce and slaw, 3% chicken cubed into tiny bits."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service of any Rubio's I have ever been to. Amazing. When I went, Mark was there and was greeting customers by name! Plus the food is spectacular as always with Rubio's. Nice work guys!"}
{"text":"Rubio's has surprised me lately, I've become a fan! They have great battered fish tacos and if you go on Tuesday night, they are only $1.50!! You can't beat that deal.

I also really like their beans, I know that seems like such a simple thing but they have tasty pinto beans on the side with yummy tortilla chips to dip.

The staff has always been friendly and accommodating no matter which location I go too. My dad raves about the shrimp burrito, it's one of his favorites!! Because of the great prices and fresh ingredients, I may find myself at Rubio's more often!"}
{"text":"This Rubios has gotten much better. They've hired better ppl. The food is always good and they've gotten more efficient"}
{"text":"nice, fresh mexican food, fast food with an elegant flair.  Nice salsa bar and portabello mushroom tacos  were awesome....no high fat feel after finishing your food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service, friendly and consistent. They fix everything with a smile... and go out of their way to please their customers. They Care. :) Tuesday specials are fantastic."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been visiting this Rubios in Mesa for about a year. We usually eat there on Tuesdays for the world famous fish tacos, but have been known to stop in other days. We always enjoy the pleasant staff, especially a certain shift manager Chris. She is always warm and friendly and by now knows our names and order. Thank you for the tasty food, fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"So bf and I went here we been to rubbish before but this one there chips we too overcooked and so salty!  3 stars cause the burrito was good and filled me up"}
{"text":"I love their chicken bowls here. So fresh. Just the perfect amount of food for a quick lunch. I also love their salsa bar. Plenty of options for every one. The staff is quick and friendly."}

{"text":"The original fish taco's...yum, my favorite! I have also tried other things here and enjoyed them all. But my go to is their original taco, hold the cabbage. 

The only non positive thing I have to say is that I am not a fan of any of their salsas. But that ok because everything I have had doesn't need them.

If you are looking for something affordable and tasty this is a good pick!"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, I am very familiar with Rubio's.  Consistent quality and the best fish tacos from a chain.

They now have mango quacomole which is essentially regular guacomole with a topping of mango salsa.  The salsa is very good and they will give you some on the side without the guac if you ask (for a small fee of course).

I love the fish tacos and the carne asada burrito.  

Because it is a chain, you don't have the diverse menu choices the more authentic mexican restaurants do but you get good quality.

I am only disappointed with their specials like lobster burrito that come and go.  They lack the proper flavors and when you like something, it disappears for a long time.

Still, for consistent quality and flavor, Rubio's delivers."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and it was a really pleasant experience. This was our first time there and I was very impressed. The manager was super friendly and knowledgeable. He was on top of the whole crew in a very friendly way. The restaurant was very clean. The food was prepared quickly and tasted great. The seating was comfortable and the price was fair. This is what happens when someone with a great idea can keep their dream going with a manager that really cares and knows how to direct his staff. I will definitely be back. Highly recommended. The fish tacos we're delicious. I wish we would have taken some photos of the food, but we were too hungry."}
{"text":"Always tasty. This place is always clean and fast. The employees are nice the salsa bar is always well kept."}
{"text":"Rubio's = good, consistent, affordable fish tacos

I am no mathematician,  but that's an equation even I can appreciate!  

They have chicken, steak, and fish tacos... and multiple types of fish available (tilapia, mahi).  And for most tacos, you have the choice of corn or flour tortilla.

My favorite is still the original grilled fish taco on a flour tortilla.  And the steak \"street tacos\" with cilantro and onion are quite authentic-tasting and delish, just like my imaginary Mexican abuela used to make!"}
{"text":"There is no reason to jump up and down eating at Rubio' s but it's convenient and their salsa bar is pretty good. For what you get, I'd say it's a bit on the high side, but I'm sure  premium  location guides prices too.  I had two small fish tacos with a mini cup of beans and a hand full of chips. Next we ordered chicken Chiquita (kid's menu) and a steak burrito, and two soft drinks for a total of $28."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying, I love Rubio's.

However, this particular Rubio's is not the best. I've been to this location a couple of times and it has been average. This past visit was different. They were friendly when I walked in. The manager, what I assume, took my order. I had to repeat my order twice--as if she was not paying attention. When I got my food, it was wrong. I had them fix it, and it was better--except the new one's portion size had decreased drastically. The employees did not look happy to be there, either. Overall, the food quality was still the same. I'm assuming this visit was just a fluke, but overall disappointing."}
{"text":"Been here before and food was good. 

Came back today to order for pick - up and everything went smooth. 

Problem is we have been waiting for 30 minutes (and still waiting) for 2 burritos.

They're 4-5 workers behind the cashier but no food is coming out. Wished our experience here was better. 

On top of all that, we have groceries that have been in the trunk during this 40 minute wait.."}
{"text":"This location is very skimpy on the food. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was shameful in comparison to the one I've had previously at another location. The quesadilla itself was comparable, but they put hardly any chips on the plate and I would even say the guacamole, salsa, and sour cream was less than half the amount I had at other locations. The manager herself have me my meal and I would have expected her to notice how barren the plate was. I would not recommend this location to anyone. The one in chandler is much better and well worth the drive"}
{"text":"I only been to Rubios on Tuesday because of the fish taco special. Fish tacos are delicious. Very fresh, fish is crispy and flavorful. I prefer my tacos with corn tortillas but a lot of my friends like the flour tortillas."}
{"text":"While staying at the Monte Carlo I ate here at least 3 times. The food was fast, fresh and delicious. I didn't realize it was a chain. I wish there were some in Houston!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a fast food joint, quality of food isn't that great, but I'll still come here if I'm in the mood of mexican food and I'm at the red rock casino. Other than that it's not all that great, I'd rather go to other restaurants in the food court. Not much of a big fan here. Taqueria's blow this place away, but this particular place I'd settle for if I want a burrito or taco's of some sort. Ehhhh"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just get a hankering for things I would never normally purchase. Fish tacos are pretty high on my list of \"things I don't buy.\" On 1/22/14 I just had to stop in and grab something and In N Out had a line wrapped around the block. 

Whenever I go to \"fast casual\" Mexican restaurants, I go for the kids' meal. They're the perfect size and come with a drink, a side and a churro. The kid's fish taco was actually... Really good! 

While I was there, some woman kept ordering extra everything while waiting for her order to come out and sent back soup twice... for a to go order. She was making loud comments about \"oh you know kids, they won't touch it if it has avocado so I need you to fix it.\" She tried to give me a look as if she was seeking my approval / agreement. Think again you heifer - you're what's wrong with people. An entitled PITA  that is holding up the kitchen. Kill yo self. Ugh. 

Next some fool (see photo) in a faux fur vest came in asking what is vegetarian on the menu. B---- this is a FISH taco place. GTFO. The poor guy behind the counter said \"real vegetarian like a vegan or pescetarian?\" This broad said \"what is a pescetarian and vegan?\" Oh girl puhleeze. Stop wasting everyone's time with deciding you're on diets that you vaguely heard about on The View. You're embarrassing yourself. He explained them and she said \"no, real vegetarian.\" Well there's only a veggie burrito so... deal. 

Between the heifer that kept sending food back and asking for extra chips and sides and... Agh! and this other fool, the kitchen was backed up. 

When my to go order came out, I said that I didn't understand how he was so calm with all of these high maintenance customers who need to get a clue - as I glared at the two wenches who were causing the problems. He smiled and said they weren't so bad and that he likes helping customers. I know he had to say it. I said \"yeah sure they are. They're jerks.\" (Amongst other things.)

4 stars for the cashier and the bomb kid's taco I had. Zero stars to high maintenance customers."}
{"text":"This location has  patio seating with umbrellas on majority of the tables. The service here is always great. The staff is very friendly and they always get my orders right. They also have vanilla coke as one of the soda choices! The staff brings the food to your table, which is very unique for a fast food type place. They also started serving the food with real plates and utensils.The sauce bar is always fully stocked with mild and hot. I recommend the mild because the hot sauce flavor is kind of strange. I've never ordered anything from here that wasn't delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the only Rubio's I eat at. The food is always good and the staff is really nice. The manager Mark is excellent! He is always making sure the patrons are doing well and that their food is just the way they ordered it. I completely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I am not sure when the update happened, but they made some changes to their menu.  I used to always order the \"Pesky\" combo, which was 2 baja style fish tacos with beans.  It's no longer called that, but the items are still on the menu.

Say what you will about the tacos (they aren't authentic, etc), I think they are super delicious.  I've been to so called \"authentic\" places that can't hold a candle to Rubio's.  Especially for baja (fried) style tacos.

The service is quick and friendly and the salsa bar is money."}
{"text":"I normally love Rubio's. In this case, the food was no exception, but the service and staff were not so great.

This location is in the food court at Red Rock. We played the 9pm bingo session and were starving, so we decided to grab a quick bite there.

It looked as if they were closed - the cashier had all of the salsas and condiments on the counter and was wiping down everything. I told my friend they were closed and she read the sign, which said that they were open until 11pm (it was only 10).

When I asked if they were open, the cashier gave me a huge attitude. I understand that you want to get out of there right at 11 and started doing your closing work early, but don't be angry when people come to order during your business hours.

It then took forever to get my food. At least, when I did get it, it was good. However, it seems as if the prices here are higher than stand alone locations, which is kind of BS, especially considering the bad service and attitude that came with it."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's.  I'll never understand why people have such hate for them or try to say they aren't good tacos.

I mean, Rubio's was pretty much responsible for bringing fish tacos to the States!  I honestly don't go there for anything else.  I LOVE their fish taco especial, and usually get the combo plate.

They have a fresh salsa bar, and everything has always been tasty here.  The staff is friendly and the food is prepared to order, but doesn't take forever.

Parking is a bit tight, and the location is at a pretty busy intersection (Serene and Eastern)."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat!! Clean and amazing customer service!!! My kids love their bean and cheese burritos. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I asked the lady at the register for any recommendations and she said she doesn't eat any of the food and couldn't recommend anything. I ended up getting two tacos with chips and beans and the tacos were good but the beans weren't. I did like the salsa though."}
{"text":"Omg the gourmet shrimp tacos are on point.  It's like the most decadent shrimp taco you will ever try at a fast food place.  The staff is pleasant and the food is worth the few extra minutes wait.  Careful of bums lurking around though.  This isn't the best neighborhood."}
{"text":"Anthony rocks. Very polite, makes eye contact, says thank you to everyone, welcomes everyone coming through the door. Also store is very clean. Recommend getting the pickled carrots"}
{"text":"I love the healthy options here. And Mason greeted me with a big sweet smile!  I think I'd come back just for that smile!"}
{"text":"It's inside the Chandler mall food court so I had low expectations but my shrimp tacos were delicious. Everything is made fresh so when you order they give you a little buzzer which I thought was weird for food court food but worth it. They have a salsa bar (like Moe's) and their salsa verde (I think that's what it was, the green one) was so good. It had a lot of cilantro which I love. I came back and ordered two chipotle ranch salads with grilled shrimp and they were pretty good but not as good as the tacos. Prices seem a little high but the quality of the ingredients are good and you can honestly taste that your food is made to order. I had a churro too, really good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"i come here at least once a fortnight, maybe more. they have consistantly great burritos, and good service. as far as rubios are concerned, this is the best in phoenix. as far as any mexican resteraunt is concerned, this is one of the better ones, not taco bell, but not tia rosas."}
{"text":"Very slow and poorly organized. Like crazy slow. But the tacos were good. Maybe try a different location that is better managed and staffed."}
{"text":"Rubio's is a solid choice for fast food American-Mexican. Their bowls are pretty good and the food comes out pretty quickly. I like the salsa bar and that you can also add plenty of cilantro, lime and onion to your food. The only thing I don't like about this location is that the bathroom seems in need of some TLC."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience I've had at Rubio's.
As a cashier You must be ready to answer questions about the menu. The girl this night didn't know what kind of Fish was on a specific taco. When asked she responded \"its regular fish.\" I was amazed at the answer an felt sorry for her. Not trying to be hard on her but I could understand if it was her first day. But I'd advise Rubio to make sure full staff gets proper training on menu. Other the food was great and store was clean!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are small but tasty. I don't really think of this as mexican food, but it's definitely clean, streamlined, and Americanized. Not my first choice for mexican fast food, but I'm more the La Tolteca / La Salcitas type.
 Don't let me turn you off-it really is pretty a-ok.

If you are scared by grubby looking dining places, then Rubios is a better choice for you.  It is a clean, attractive, chain restaurant.  I'm pretty sure that it's Number One for decent fast food American/Mexican style."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food was very good.  Love Rubios!  Staff was very attentive.  Food came out promptly.  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Love Tuesdays here!! Fish tacos!!! I get them with flour tortillas and an extra side of white sauce!! So yummy the salsas are also very good!! Bomb dot com! The beans are good too but for me it's all about the fish tacos!! The best!!"}
{"text":"Eh wasn't tasty at all it tasted no bueno  maybe next time it will taste better but for no it's pretty dang garbage and I hope nobody ever goes here evverrrrrr"}
{"text":"The only fast food worth eating in my book. Great seafood tacos and awesome tortilla soup and all the condiments you want at the self serve bar. now that is some damned good grinds!"}
{"text":"So disappointed tonight :( ordered my favorite salad - Orange Talapia, the young lady asked me twice if I'd like the fish blackened or grilled, I asked for grilled and got blackened again (happened at another location once before and I just ate it that time) but it's super spicy, so she brought me my salad and I said I'm sorry I ordered grilled fish, she was so rude she didn't say anything, took my salad came back 15 minutes later (by this time my husband was done with his tacos) and brought it back,  it look like white mush and I think they just scraped all the blackened skin off and reserved it!. Again she didn't say anything, by this time I just ate the salad but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Rubio's before and was afraid trying one at a food court wouldn't give the best first impression. Boy, was I wrong. 
There was a decent line yet the cashiers were able to run orders fairly quick. I was told fish tacos was the way to go and saw the 'new' mango fish taco. The price was little higher than I think it was worth, but everything else about it was great! It was a little sweet from the mango, but after adding onions to balance it out, I'm pretty sure I inhaled the tacos they were so good. I also got to sample my friends various tacos and burritos and all were delicious. 
If it wasn't for the price, I would probably be here once a week for tacos!"}
{"text":"Got my order correct, and a very short wait time for my to go order. Blondie at the front was amazing and so sweet, she deserves a raise Food is exquisite!"}
{"text":"This isnt bad for a self serve taco shop. Its not authentic mexican food, but its clean organized and the price isnt too bad. 

Id say my favorite thing is lobster burrito. I dont go there unless I get that. So I dont really have input on the other food.
I really like the help yourself salsa bar. Thats always a plus. Many different salsa. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love eating here, food has always been great for my partner and I. Always a fabulous choice for quick and delicious! The staff is also always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5-star reviews but if the staff/human interaction factor stands out either negative or positive it has heavy weight in my ultimate rating.

Was heading over to catch a flic and decided to pop in here for a little apres-3 mile run dinner before the movie.  I rarely go to Rubio's based on location as Baja Fresh is closer to me. 

The manager was working the till when I walked in and greeted me with a genuine welcoming.  I ordered the Mango Habanero Ono Two Taco special.  Obviously I am a gringo but it the best way the manager asked me if I like it HOT?  I said not really and he let me know this particular platter was pretty spicy.  I said I just had a hankering for the mango accents.  So, he quickly had the grillmaster put some of the mango salsa in a cup with a single tortilla chip to taste.  Ok, that works for me.  He then gave special instructions to modify the platter so only the mango salsa was added and not the other really spicy stuff.

I sat down and grabbed a 3% lemonaide and within minutes he delivered the meal to my table in a very friendly way.  Great meal for $10 and as I left I thanked him and he did the same.  So many of these \"fast-food\" places could learn from this man."}
{"text":"I love the food at Rubio's in general. This location in particular is always good, staff is always friendly and welcoming. I've never had good that didn't seem fresh and great.  I recently had a picky eater to order for and they so nicely offered to put the spicy ingredients and sauce on the side! I'll keep coming."}
{"text":"The original fish taco plate is the BEST. I love their food here, and the service is always great. I went today and our server was so friendly and gave us suggestions. He came and checked to make sure we liked the food as well! Keep your receipt, you'll get a free large drink with a short survey!"}
{"text":"My Rubios go to blackened salmon burrito was prepared fresh and delicious. Ample portions if salmon rice and guacamole plus spicy roasted picante makes this burrito extra yummy."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  I had the tacos and my husband had an enchilada.  The service was terrible!  Granted its a fast food chain but we seemed to be more of a bother for staff to wait on us and it was pricy.  Our food seemed to be just quickly thrown together and they were not busy!  I went back to the counter and asked for sour cream and they said they had none....I said 'seriously' and staff replied with 'it costs extra'  I said 'just never mind...willing to pay but forget it!  I don't want to bother you.'  Staff member turned around and continued chatting with other co workers.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Since I've lived on the east coast my entire life until I moved here 2 weeks ago, this is the first time I've ever tried a Rubio's. I have to say this place is way better than Chipotle, Taco Bell, or any of the other chain Mexican places. I ordered the Coastal Trio, which came with a shrimp taco, original fish taco, and a tilapia taco. Shrimp was my favorite as the shrimp was tender, fresh, and not rubbery at all. The fish in the original fish taco was crunchy on the outside, and soft and flaky on the inside. I loved the contrast in textures there. Also, the girl at the front register was an absolute sweetheart. I claimed my free birthday meal and she didn't even charge tax. On top of that, she gave me a free fountain drink on the house! This is now one of my favorite fast food joints and will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Rubio's Is always a great choice! Food is always fresh and tasty. I always mix and match what I order and it's always great! Customer service is also great! Always friendly and attentive ! One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"This is the Rubios to go to. I have had Rubios in California for a decade and this one fits right in. 

The management and staff are great at what they do. I recently had an order with a lot of special items and instructions and our cashier was being trained. He quickly alerted the kitchen and another cashier of the needed information. When my food came out the second cashier brought it out and reviewed the items with me that he had checked back in the kitchen. 

Taco Tuesday is a steal and the best burritos I crave are here. If you want lighter but with a little bite the chopped chicken salad is my go to for a feel good/taste good meal."}
{"text":"The go to for fish tacos. They have a deal for taco Tuesday $1.50 each after two pm. Well have like 10 tacos on our table. I usually get chips with my order because they have a salsa bar and one time I forgot to add it to the order the manager just gave me it for free. Mad respect for the crew there."}
{"text":"My son and his friend sent me a special request of Rubio's quesadillas for lunch today. As I walked in I noticed Yelp had $2 off check-in offer, which they honored. 
It was still slow because it was still early in the day, and they made my order really quickly. The restaurant itself was very clean and the employees including the manager were very friendly. 
The food looked really good and I was tempted to take a bite before I dropped it off. The kids said the food was really good and was still hot after it was sitting in the box for 30 min. The meal came with chips and guacamole along with sour cream and fill yourself salsa. 
Honestly, I was impressed with this location. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"They do an alright job for a chain Mexican restaurant. I will say they've definitely improve their food quality look and atmosphere of the restaurants. I know they are rebranding trying to attract a new crowd. Food is what you'd expect. A little on the corporate Chipotle Style restaurant. If you sign up for their email Club you get a free Entree and also free Taco plus other free items and discounted items."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Rubio's in probably 10 years. They have definitely improved the quality of the food. Still corporate but much better. Definitely prefer a mom-and-pop taco shop but they do a good job plus when you sign up with your email you get a free Entree. Plus other specials. I had the chicken and steak burrito Especial."}
{"text":"So a few years ago I discovered my favorite thing about Japan: robotic beer pouring machines. I still go out of my way to change planes inn Tokyo so I can star in amazement. (Plus enjoy a nice Sapporo, or three) Rubios is the closest thing I can find in my native California: a fast food place that somehow serves both beer and lobster burritos. How could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I'm a big Rubio's fan and this could well be their best location. We were served by the manager who correctly prepared our tricky order with a smile. Worth visiting for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I've never been to a better rubios! my food is always cooked perfectly and they work with how picky i am without an issue. Bryce is my favorite grill cook and Daniel the manager has great customer service. the whole pm staff rocks!"}
{"text":"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I came to this location at the end of the day to meet a friend for a quick bite.  I love rubios fish tacos but these had an awkward taste of funky grease.  I notified the gal behind the counter -  they were more than happy to replace the item with some chicken tacos with out question.  I'm usually not one to send food back - but when I might get sick I'll comment .  Thanks guys for making a possible bad experience an amazing one."}
{"text":"I've lived about two minutes away from this place for years but only recently stopped in for the first time. Maybe because I don't eat seafood and didn't realize they would offer awesome chicken tacos! I like that they have plenty of gluten free options too. The grilled gourmet, classic and street tacos are all great."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Rubio's several times as it is a change from the usual fast food fare.  On this particular day, I visited the Bell location.  As I was walking in, I received a phone call.  So as to not be rude, I did not approach the counter...even though there were no other customers there.   After completing my phone call...about 1 minute....I approached the counter where \"shift supervisor\" James was standing.  I immediately noticed he was leaning on the wall with his arms crossed.  He didn't even greet me.  I asked if he was ready and he replied \"yes\".  Not even a smile.  I placed an order to include a plate and an ala carte taco.  After he entered the info into the cash register,  he read back the order to confirm.  It wasn't correct.  I asked again for the items and he began to berate me saying that is not what I said the first time.  I cancelled the order and left.  I won't go back to that location again."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I called to ask about a dish in the menu, the ladie laughed and said no we only have tacos. Thank you for laughing in my ear, you have officially lost my business"}
{"text":"I usually like the atmosphere of Rubio's but this visit I was little disappointed. The service was so slow and they were out of all the salsa at 5pm for the day."}
{"text":"Mmmm Good (and I'm not talking soup)

My first time to Rubio's was awesome.  The girl at the counter was very helpful and knowledgable. She gave some great suggestions and boy were they ever right.  I LOVED the Tilapia fish taco.  Somehow before I tried it the words 'fish' and 'taco' just never seemed to go together.  Now that I've had it, I'm still not sure. 
Thanks for a great experience.  I may try some more at another time."}
{"text":"Man, I forgot about Rubio's for a while, but was pleasantly reminded what a solid option it is when looking for a quick, on-the-cheap-side lunch. 

I had a shrimp and bacon burrito, spicy and fresh and hearty, and I managed to sample the shrimp tacos my wife ordered as well - really solid. The chips were crunchy, and the many salsa's kept me intrigued by new flavors. The fresh lemons and limes to squeeze over food were a nice touch as well. Rubio's the man!"}
{"text":"This Rubio's is located within the Monte Carlo Resort & Hotel in the food court. The prices are a little steeper because of this but that doesn't stop me from eating here. The customer service I receive is always friendly, they have a smile on their face and for the number of customers they are serving during the lunch rush, the food comes out quick.

Their burritos are my favorite. I love their tortillas and their pinto beans. I normally get the kids meal because the regular sized burrito is way too big for me. Their chips are delish...sometimes they need a little salt. If you can make it to dessert then get their churros. They are bomb! Oh and they have a nice little salsa bar with a variety of different salsa and sauces. If you get a soda with your meal then you can get free refills (which is unheard of for a casino!).

Besides burritos they also have street tacos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas. I have heard fabulous things about their fish tacos. Also, they serve breakfast! OMG their bacon, egg and cheese breakfast burrito is to die for. They don't skimp either, that thing is jam packed with all the goods. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Great food every time we come here. Staff is friendly and attentive and food is fresh, salsa bar kept clean as well as bathrooms and overall store."}
{"text":"The food and the people here are always so amazing. They hire the best employees that always greet me with a smile and the food always tastes amazing. I recommend them to anyone. I get the California bowl and it is very delicious. These employees deserve a raise for always providing such excellent service! I will keep eating here on my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked in to Rubio's at 8:34 pm 02/06/16 and were greeted half-heartedly. The cashier came out to take our order and had a bitter attitude from the start. Instead of being helpful about healthier menu options he was snappy and I didn't appreciate it. I understand the store closes at 9, but I didn't think we were late enough to cause such irritability. As we walked away, I heard him say he was going to lock the door because \"it's 8:30\" and I assume it was his manager who said \"no, we're still open.\" We sat at a table as the manager cleaned up around us and proceeded to belch out loud. Absolutely disgusting. Thankfully, the food was decent but I do not recommend coming into this store anytime past 8pm unless that's the kind of behavior you'd like to deal with. What a shame.

Also, the manager then proceeded to literally sweep our feet as we sat at the table finishing our food. Absolutely rude and inappropriate. I'll be contacting corporate tomorrow to complain about the poorest customer service ever received at Rubio's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rubio's!!!! They have fresh ingredients and an awesome salsa bar with chopped cilantro and onions as well as any taco topping you want! I love their fish tacos on flour tortillas . I usually get the regular and the especial fish tacos. The especial have guacamole and some other extra things on them. They do catering and have salads, burritos, enchiladas and also serve beer and wine. Anytime I am near a rubios I pop in and grab food because I'm never disappointed!! Five stars at any location all around the valley!!!!!!! Thank you Rubio's for being so awesome :)"}
{"text":"When I used to work in downtown Phoenix, I would sometimes make the drive out to 44th and Indian School just to get me some fish tacos. The staff is pretty friendly here, it's a large space with a great patio, and clean! 

While I have a wealth of Mexican to choose from in AZ, I really do love Rubios, chain or not. I've been going to them all over the Valley since they first started opening. Solid menu, cheap, and satisfying. Love their salsa bar. $1.50 fish tacos, burros under $5, mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Oh, Rubio's! How I love thee! You must put crack in your fish tacos because I think I am addicted. I have no need to try anything else at your fine establishment because the sun rises and sets upon your glorious fishy goodness. Have I had better fish tacos? Almost certainly yes. But there is some indefinable feature of your tacos that draws me back again and again. I feel almost embarrassed by how much I care for you, Rubio's fish taco. But I don't care. I wish the whole world to know how great you are. You had me at first bite. So long for now Rubio's fish taco, but I will be there soon to enjoy your company once more."}
{"text":"We have come to rubios for years and always been satisfied. Unfortunately tonight was a very negative experience. We were pressed for time so we decided to hit rubios for a quick dinner. My kids love their quesadillas and guacamole. 

Of course the first thing we are told is \"sorry we don't have any guacamole.\" How does a rubios not have guacamole?!?!?! When this ingredient is seriously in almost every single item on your menu, maybe don't do a huge catering order that depletes your entire guacamole inventory. 

I asked for the customer service number to call and complain, I was told to wait while they searched for a card with the number on it. Then they said that they couldn't find the card. I've never heard of an establishment not being able to produce a customer service phone number. I know the guacamole doesn't sound like a big deal to most but we had very little time to eat and without the guacamole, my kids didn't eat their 30 dollar dinner. Such a bummer. Buy more guacamole!"}
{"text":"Friendly service - quality and fast meals- delivered to your table.

Great neighborhood Mexican cafe!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some good Taco Tuesday deals tonight, 4/18/17, and Rubio's did not disappoint.
We enjoyed their \"Original Fish Tacos\" with extra mild salsa.  We ordered to go and the food was quick and fresh.  Even in the midst of a busy night, the staff was polite, charming, and welcoming.  We will definitely go back for future Taco Tuesday cravings."}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times without even considering it. So a friend suggested it. I have to say I love fish tacos. This place did not disappoint. It's now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Picked up a shrimp burrito here in Vegas since I can't eat meat today for religious reasons. It definitely exceeded my expectations! It was delicious."}
{"text":"I love me some Rubio's and my favorites are any dish that has shrimp! I love their Shrimp burritos and shrimp tacos. 

The service is great, the food is tasty and they are consistent. 

This most recent visit was a FREE Birthday meal compliments of their beach club. 

I decided on the Cabo plate which is the Classic grilled shrimp burrito, fish taco, rice, beans and chips.

It was REALLY good, what a nice treat! They have really fresh crispy tortillas chips!


I am a fan of Rubio's it is a nice change and variety from the crazy chicken!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service! I had the fish tacos which were wonderful. My daughter ordered the California Bowl which was too spicy for her. The employees noticed she wasn't eating and asked if everything was okay; when we explained the issue they immediately offered to remake it without the spicy chipotle sauce. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this location! Quick service, hit food, tastes great and clean location too. 
I come here often, especial for their Taco Tuesday specials after 2:30 (Fish Tacos!)
One of their employees is really good and courteous. He is good with remembering names too and always greeting the customers. 
Jackson is very good at what he does."}
{"text":"I would not say this is the cleanest restaurant. I was hesitant to use the self serve bar. I don't expect perfection but I do expect to not see \"grime\" on the Tea container & the Fountain drinks  The employees are very nice. I ordered 3 original fish tacos. Soooo bomb"}
{"text":"Some of the best fast food baja available in the Phoenix area.  For the price, it's hard to beat this place.

This location has received awards for outstanding service and more.  The owner and regular employees tend to learn people's names over time, and it's a great little atmosphere for enjoying affordable, tasty food.

Great location right off the 101."}
{"text":"Completely downhill in the past few months as the management changed and a lot of the staff in general have changed.  NOW HIRING sign has been up for awhile, so perhaps the fault rests with understaffing."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place if you're bored when you get off work on Taco Tuesday and hit the dinner rush hour. Its refreshing to sit and wait 30 minutes for your order and afterwards wondering if the reason I feel like vomiting and having explosive diarrhea is either a gift from god pushing your Faith or possible food poisoning. I don't know if I'm just lucky enough to be the only person to feel this way especially on God's day (Taco Tuesday) or if they were in a big rush during dinner rush hour. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Ana Rocks!! Every time I come into this location she is always on point and provides fabulous customer service! Keep up the great work! This lady deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh. The only thing is expect to wait for your food for awhile. Take advantage of the salsa bar while you wait!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today and picked up a fish and chicken taco. The fish taco was good, but the chicken taco was really sloppy. Upon unwrapping the foil, I noticed the avocado slices were all halfway inside the taco and the other halves were squished in the foil. The guy that helped me was really nice and friendly and very helpful. I've been to other Rubio's in Chandler and Ahwatukee and the food presentation/condition has always been consistently good and never that messy. Could have been a bad service day and might stop again if in the area."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at Rubio's, but this time decided to try something new. I ordered the California bowl and the portion was surprisingly small. Only few pieces of chicken. They charged $9. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Really close to Midwestern University.

I'd recommend getting the kids meal. They will let you swap out the toy and crayons for a large sized drink. I personally enjoy the kids fish taco. Not a lot of food but it will keep your portion sizes under control. :)

I have ordered \"adult\" meals and they are kinda small as well. Especially when you factor in how much they cost. Maybe I am just ordering all of the Wrong items?

They have a salsa bar which is pretty delicious and a great way to customize your meal."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos on the west coast! The coastal trio was delicious and filling. Even though it is placed in the Monte Carlo food court if you are a fish taco lover as my husband and I are then check out Rubio's! Don't knock it until you try it. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great location and store is always clean. Rubio's has new items frequently, and promotions to go along with them! The salsa bar is my favorite in town, and the menu has something for everyone! Try the $1.50 Fish Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Always my top choice for quick service Mexican!
Consistently fresh and always tasty with a great menu, Rubio's is pretty much a top notch establishment. This physical location is not the greatest of locations as it's deep in the Eastern corridor of hell, as I refer to it. The promise of yummy tacos with delicious salsa is hard to resist when I'm in the area, however. The wait can be a bit extensive sometimes but I like to say it's worth it for fresh food. Among my faves here are the grilled gourmet tacos with shrimp (mmm bacon) and the salmon burrito. And the Tuesday fish tacos for $1.50 is now $1.75 I believe. This is always a popular deal and it's usually pretty busy."}
{"text":"Solid, reliable fish tacos.  Sometimes in life, that's all the world really needs.  Rubio's always comes through. 

Now please...open stores in the Midwest!!!"}
{"text":"I need a good make up meal after eating here because the food was so bad. How do you mess up refried beans and salmon tacos? I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for the first time. I ordered take out and Got Home and was eating my tacos and found a brown hair. I threw it out... Such a disappointment and gross."}
{"text":"Good food (for fast food) and very friendly staff. Try the original fish tacos, awesome!"}
{"text":"For you Seinfeld fans \"it's not fast food Jerry, it's good food quickly\".  Rubios has some really good things going for it. First off I love the salsa verde shrimp tacos. I get the plate which comes with 2 tacos and chips and bean dip or you can sub rice or black beans. The also offer mahi, salmon and tilapia....many seafood options which is nice. 

The shrimp tacos are served on a flour tortilla with sliced avocado and a creamy chipotle sauce, absolutely delicious.  Rubios also has a great salsa bar with several different salsas, peppers and fresh lemon and lime slices. For under $9 it is a budget friendly lunch or dinner option. 

The service has always been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"rubio's is amazing.  their fish tacos were so delicious.  i almost couldn't believe they were from a chain."}
{"text":"For a cheaper Baja-style Mexican chain, Rubio's is about as good as you can get. I've had several of their burritos and tacos, and I've yet to really be disappointed. The gourmet chicken/bacon taco, the fish taco especial, the health-mex chicken burrito, and the chicken burrito especial are my favorites. Their mild red salsa and their green salsa are awesome! I don't like the bitter flavor of their hot red salsa, and I'm not crazy about the dark smoky-flavored one, either, but I love the other two so much that I don't care. Their chips are thin & crisp.

The beans lack flavor, so if you're a beans fan, try mixing one of the salsas in with your beans to make them more interesting. I typically don't like Mexican-style rice, so I can't vouch for theirs.

The service at this location has always been good, and they share a cute little courtyard with the other places in this strip, so it's a great, easy place to grab some lunch by yourself or with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, always clean, always friendly, and reasonable prices. We frequently come here for some quick good Mexican. It's fast food without feeling like fast food. I've never been disappointed in anything I have ever gotten here. It's all good from the chicken to the shrimp. I would probably even enjoy their veggie options."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!!! The food is delicious and it's really close to my house. The great thing is eating here before or after your movie. It's one of the better choices in Aliante, if you don't mind eating in the food court. You can also get pretty healthy fare here. Might I suggest the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito?? Cause it's mighty tasty! Especially with the tomatillo salsa and a little lime. I tried the mahi mahi fish tacos as well, but I much prefer the burrito. I think it has more flavor and the portion is HUGE! One burrito will definitely fill you up. If not, it comes with chips too."}
{"text":"I love Rubio's and this location is the best. I always customize a bowl with shrimp and fish and it is always so fresh! The guacamole is to die for!  The manager (Steve, I think) runs this place like a well oiled machine. Consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the Coastal Trio Tacos and Salsa Bar!"}
{"text":"I had my first case, and I hope to God my last case of food poisoning from the chicken street tacos at this location. I used to really love Rubios for a quick yummy meal but am now hesitant to eat at one again. Hopefully it was just a one time fluke. I'm sure with time I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Over 18$ for 1 person to have a burrito, 2 mini street tacos and a drink. Ridiculous price and sadly not leaving even full."}
{"text":"good food!  My first visit was Tuesday, had the halibut taco special, loved it.
The restaurant was clean, and the service was friendly.   We'll be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I come to Rubio's for one thing, the herb garlic shrimp tacos with bacon. I was craving these and I was on this end of town so I stopped by. This Rubio's has great seating (inside and out) and super friendly service. They were also sampling food options as you waited for your food. How awesome is that?!"}
{"text":"I usually go for the garlic herb shrimp tacos- 2 taco plate. You get yourself some picante salsa, tomatillo salsa, pickled carrots and jalopenos, sit down and start eating. 2.5 seconds later when you've inhaled your food- you can thank me. swing by on tuesdays for $1.50 fish tacos (after 2PM). You're welcome."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rubios but this location is having some serious issues. The staff isn't very pleasant or efficient at all. Dining in is a mistake because that place is not clean. It is hard to enjoy the food when everywhere you look needs a clean up. I wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes. The prices are not cheap so it would be nice to have some more quality in the experience."}
{"text":"I ate here twice during my stay at the Monte Carlo. Out of the other restaurants inside the hotel, I enjoyed this one the most. Food was fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"I came in for my birthday free meal. The cashier (Bryson) was particularly helpful. A meal is always just a bit better when the employees seem to be enjoying their job. 
I ordered the Baja Combo plate. A burrito, a fish taco and beans/chips side. This location seems to be a notch better at the size of the burrito. I generally substitute black beans for both the side and on the burrito. It was as tasty as always, but I find I need to add some of their salsa to add to the general flavor.
As a side note, Rubios picante salsa is terrible, however all of the other fresh made salad are enjoyable. 
I came with a friend, and the food was more than enough to split for lunch. Its location is convenient for parking, but it is busy and can take a few minutes to get the fresh made food."}
{"text":"what an unexpected treat!  decided to eat here after seeing a movie.  had the salsa Verde shrimp tacos and they were delicious. just the right amount of shrimp and seasoning.  the condiment bar is loaded with different salsas, jalapenos, cilantro, and lemons and limes. great to eat alfresco and watch the mall walkers."}
{"text":"Rubio's on 59th Ave north of the 101 is very good.  Good, fresh food, good service, and clean restaurant.  I'm a fan for sure."}
{"text":"Wow.  The food was very good and the service was good.  The food was fresh, the restaurant clean and the servings were adequate.  We will return to try some of their new dishes, including salmon tacos."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Rubio's in years, but after overhearing some coworkers talking about fish tacos, I had a hankering that I finally have in to. I stopped in at this location on a Tuesday thinking they had discounted fish tacos, but much to my chagrin, it was only after 2:30. Darn, but I decided to order a fish taco combination plate anyway since I was already.

The fish was ok, but the tortillas were stale and chewy and the sauce was just so bland. Nostalgia is a crazy thing, as I remember loving these tacos, but I don't think I'll be stopping by again any time soon."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Rubio's, I think \"Why didn't I just drive to Gallo Blanco downtown?\" Still, Rubio's is close, quick and has great service.  

This location has very friendly employees.  They keep the restaurant clean and do so with a smile.

The food is fresh and filling.  The salsa bar is great (I prefer the green salsa here, whereas everywhere else I like red).  

They are famous for their fish tacos, but I think their carne asada street tacos are pretty good, too.  This is coming from someone who eats Vegan at home and only occasionally eats meat, so take that under advisement.  

I like their refried beans, which contain no lard.  In fact, nothing here is made with lard.  The beans are still delicious, but they are healthier than your typical Mexican fast food joint.

For the price, I still think it is worth it to go to Gallo Blanco.  If you are in Ahwatukee and have limited time (perhaps you are just grabbing a bite before your movie), then Rubio's is a good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the Ancho Shrimp Burrito today with chips and drink for  $8.99 which is not to bad.

Little skimpy on the chips and the burrito was not bad. Could say it is white man's mexican food but not bad for fast food. The tortilla is not of the home made authentic soft type but it is a chain.

The burrito looked better on the advertisement than in reality. Had a few shrimp but was expecting a few more.

Hard not to compare to the more authentic mexican restaurants because we live in Arizona but maybe not fair.

Will probably be back but if I want a more authentic mexican food experience I will eat at my go to places but considering time and location it is what it is."}
{"text":"Location: lots of tables. It has a huge station for different types of salsas, cilantro and soft drinks to choose from. Folks, knives, spoons, straws were all organized in one area. 

Service: staffs and generally friendly and patience. 
Food: I usually order the mango mahi mahi taco and it is absolutely juicy and delicious. 

Rating: I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about once a month for the last two years. This place is going down hill fast! Last time we tried to eat outside but every chair was covered in bird poop. Clearly they hadn't ever been cleaned. Tonight while eating my husband notice bugs crawling all over the bench inside that I was sitting on and on the wall behind me. Tons of little black bugs. I told the manager and he didn't seem too concerned. The cleanliness of this location is terrible and this was gross. We'll be going to the other Rubio's locations."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years. The food was actually pretty good, but I waited forever and it was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I purchased the cilantro lime bowl and was completely unhappy with the serving size. If you want a vegan option or a salad, don't come here!"}
{"text":"My coworkers favorite place to eat is Rubio's so I stopped in really quick to get a gift card. I think it was around 3pm on a Monday so it wasn't super busy and as soon as I walked in I was told hello and a few employees seemed to be multitasking. I was imeadiately helped with a pleasant smile, got my gc and ran out. It was just very nice to see everyone genuinely smiling. So many times, even at resturants where you are seated and served, employees always seem grumpy like I'm bothering them by being a patron there. Not the case with this Rubio's, even when I just ran in for a gift card. Thank you for being so nice, it's refreshing! :-)"}
{"text":"Gross!  Their tortilla soup tasted like vomit.  After two spoons full I proceeded to throw up in the bathroom!  NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I'm 7 months pregnant and got food poisoning here. I was vomiting for 15 straight hours and had to go to the emergency room to treat dehydration. Miserable and very scary experience for me and my unborn child. Either the food isn't fresh, not cooked properly, or they don't have proper sanitation practices.  Seriously, don't eat here. It scares me to think it could have been so much worse for my baby."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled citrus shrimp burrito. Easy to split with a friend if you have a smaller appetite. Glad they had unsweetened green tea as a drink option. I would also enjoy a caffeine free herbal tea if that were available. Fast service and pleasant outdoor patio seating with attractive string lights to view at night."}
{"text":"Best chain Mexican food I've ever had from a fast food place.  More authentic style tortillas and meat preparations."}
