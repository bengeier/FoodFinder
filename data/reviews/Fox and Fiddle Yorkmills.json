{"text":"I love this place. I hop over with my coworkers from Rogers to here back in the days. My favourite is chipotle chicken wrap. 5 stars because they have Tuesday night half price!"}
{"text":"The WORST Service received anywhere. When you walk in, there's no hostess even ready to help you get seated right away. You basically wait and continue waiting until they choose to walk over. 
When we got seated, it took over 10 minutes for a place that was not even that busy that we had the flag a random greeter down to ask where and who our server was.
When the dark brown coloured hair waitress (Nanya) came over, she had the most unfriendly welcome ever. She asked what we wanted to drink, and we said we were ready to order. We ordered a poutine, a pound of wings, and a chipotle chicken wrap. 
The initial food came within a reasonable time. The male server however dipped his entire sleeve over the gravy and cheese of our poutine and it was literally all over his sleeve. We asked for a new order, along with some plum sauce. After 30 minutes of finishing the wings and wrap/fries, the poutine never came nor did the plum sauce. We told the male server and our waitress and they just look displeased while apologizing once. We never were asked if we needed any condiments or water or anything at all. This place honestly brings down the fox and fiddle company image big time. Perhaps there needs massive training for all their staff. Acknowledge customers regardless of how many tables you need to wait, at least apologize because they are swamped. 
In future, please have a manager on the floor. I think they would have visibly seen some upset customers were."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I took my girlfriend, brother, and brother's girlfriend to this place for a couple of drinks. I was at work until 11 pm and checked Yelp and Google that they are open until 2 am, so we decided to go there for my girlfriend's birthday since it was walking distance from my house. After waiting for 10 minutes the server came and told us that last call is in 10 minutes (at 12) and that we can order what we want before then and then stay there and finish it. We ordered our drinks, but the server never came to ask if everything was OK or if we needed water. At 12:40 a guy came and told us \"hey kids you have 10 minutes to finish your drinks and leave\", which seemed odd that they are closing at 12:50 while online it states 2 am. After 5 minutes he came back told us that they are closed and all the staff is ready to go home and that \" you have two options, leave in 5 seconds or I will toss your a** out\". He then took our drinks away, even though we had settled our $100 bill. I had never been this disrespected in my life."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Westin Prince across the street and just wanted some wings and a beer. The wings were good, bartender told me the beer I wanted was not available and I had to tell him it was in the cooler behind the bar and the staff was more interested in cleaning and cashing out than in service. Too bad that the staff gave me zero reason to come back. Except the cook I suppose."}
{"text":"Been a regular here since it opened, guess you would call it my neighbourhood pub. In general the service is pretty good and the food is decent. Favourites include the burgers (no bun, no gluten free options) and the Mediterranean Nachos. They have a great patio and live music on some Saturday nights. I'd say my favourite part is the patio, great lounge chairs if you can get a spot at them. They show sporting events on the TVs as well, which is pretty standard for pubs. Prices are decent to a little high for some of the quality, but in general the Fox is a good stop for eats and drinks."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. The waitresses basically did the absolute minimum when I was there. It's pretty bad when you have to signal a waitress to refill your water cup, and she was walking past my table every few minutes!

I've been to restaurants like these before, where the waitress do very little and have a sense of entitlement to expect the best of tips, just because they flash some tits and ass. Several months later, the staff was dramatically downsized and they had to actually start doing real work instead of standing around looking pretty."}
{"text":"Their desserts are delicious! The lasagna is also my favourite. I love coming here with my friends for drinks and even for a date. It's good to come and watch games. The fireplace in the back is nice too"}
{"text":"Fancy decor but everyone's casual. We went Saturday night at 9pm and it wasn't busy at all. 

Food was good. Korean bbq chicken wings (12.99) were nice and crispy. Chicken and cheese quesadilla (12.99) and buffalo chicken poutine (13.99?) were good too. The high five layer cake (6.99) was super chocolately. 

Service was good. Everyone was nice."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the patio here!! The chairs were comfortable, albeit the view is of a parking lot and people going into FIVE GUYS. We had a rowdy group who ordered rounds and rounds of drinks - the service was amazing, the drinks were refilled quickly and the food came quick. I'd definitely come back here for after work drinks again. It's too bad patio season is going to be over soon!"}
{"text":"We went for their \"halloween bash\" with our party of 8 and here we are being told that last call is at 11pm.  Unbelievable. When we saw they were having a Halloween night, we assumed we could stay until usual hours on the Saturday. What kind of self respecting business closes early on a Saturday halloween?!?!? They also didn't decide our cheques properly, which normally wouldn't be a big deal but coupled with the circumstances kinda bothered me...."}
{"text":"Decent food, nice decor, great service. Finding a Fox and Fiddle in this part of town was surprising. Nestled between Chinese buffets and pho places, it resembles more of a Moxies or Jack Astors rather than the pub-style Fox and Fiddles downtown.

I recommend a draft or pitcher of Smithwicks, an Irish ale that was a hit at our table. The food was ok, pretty standard for the chain."}
{"text":"I have been here a ton, it's a great place to meet with friends and have a few drinks. 

The food is alright, nothing special. The fries arent very good, but thats alright. 

The waitresses are friendly and talkative. I would recommend this place for grabbing drinks and a snack. 

Ps. The chipotle chicken wrap is 10/10"}
{"text":"Great go-to casual pub. Lots of space, great staff and delicious food at average price range. Beautiful large patio too. We ordered buffalo poutine and spicy chicken  sandwich. They were both great! Nothing overly fancy or special, just a nice staple!"}
{"text":"Good service, clean and lots of tvs to watch the game. Beer deals on Leaf game nights. Had a cheese burger. I've had a lot of burgers in my days from pubs and restaurants and I must say this is right up there as the best one I've had. I didn't want it to end other than the fact I could barely get the last nite down. It's a big juicy burger, nice bun as well. The only thing I could suggest is turning the over head lights down a bit, it was very bright. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience while in Toronto. Food was awful and for the price you'd expect a Greek Salad with actual greek olives and not topped with green and red peppers. Definitely not ta good dining experience. The chicken wrap was mainly lettuce and the chicken in the poutine was subpar."}
{"text":"Decent food at decent prices.   Kid friendly menu too.  Buffalo wings a bit on the smaller side but the sauces were good ( buffalo butter and Korean BBQ).  It wasn't that busy but the service was slow which was a downer 
Interesting to note that the meager selection of Canadian beers on tap and lack of Canadian hockey on the TV was weird. 
Not a bad place to eat if your looking to avoid the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Never going back. Went here for a friend's birthday on a Friday night, we checked the hour before we went and it said that it's open until 2 am, and since we were all at work till late we figured we have enough time. However, at 12:45 this guy (maybe the owner) gave us a 10 minute warning to leave. I should add that at this point we had already paid for all our drinks, which totalled to about $100 and we were only half way done. This person came back in 5 minutes and told us to leave and we told him that we paid for these drinks and we want to finish them, he said \"you have 5 seconds to finish or else I'll toss your ass out\". So he ended up taking our drinks away so we had to leave.
The costumer services was horrible, and I didn't even mention how awful the server was. 
I recommend to everyone to find another place to go to, the Fox and Fiddle is HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Might not know amazing poutine but their poutine was delicious and service was great. Perfect for some World Cup viewing."}
{"text":"I never know what to write for a Fox pub. But this definitely one of the better ones I've been to. We usually go for lunch from the office i find the service a little slow 

The food I've found to be relatively fresh and the menu is definitely quite extensive. Lots to chose from. I didn't like the chicken fingers as much a bit dry and scrawny thin pieces, the wings are a better choice."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of my life in any restaurant or bar. When you tell people there is a last call but they still have time to drink what they ordered, do not come running at them like a hormonal teen looking to get your anger out. The manager, if I can even call him that, based on his poor customer service skills gave us a ten minute warning to leave and when we stayed for our ten minutes came back and started to threaten us by swearing at us and adding in how he was going to \"toss our ass out\". I am a woman and I was not the only one at the table. Threatening all the table and swearing at all of us is not the way to handle customers. I am never going back again. Learn how to talk in the presence of a lady and learn how to be a civilized human being."}
{"text":"Very busy pub so service was a bit slow. Great selection of drinks. I tried the Fox Zephyr. Way too sweet. Pub menu is definitely British. I got the buttered chicken (not spicy at all - really enjoyed it) and my partner got the lamb stew. Table wasn't super clean and there was a lot of foot traffic going back and forth and almost hitting the table. Our waitress was nice but clearly super busy. A bit expensive but we did order several drinks and those do add up."}
{"text":"Good wings. Slow service and closed early on Halloween on a Saturday because \"they were slow\" unsure if they were referring to their service because there was a half decent amount of customers."}
{"text":"We tried this new restaurant for dinner last night.  What a treat!    Clean inviting restaurant, with new furnishings, new bathrooms, new cutlery...  Service was quick, attentive and friendly (Marlene).  The food was delicious!  The only downside was tight parking spaces, but that won't stop us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 3 days as it is across the street from the hotel I am staying at. Service each time has been Horrible. The last time the bartender did not come back for 20 minutes even my glass was empty and though I stared at him around the bar. Internet connection is crappy at best. Pass."}
{"text":"I came in with a party of 20+ at last minute because our office was just around the corner. They were able to sit us and we had 2 waitress' and 1 new trainee. The drinks that everyone ordered came out at a decent time and the food took a little longer but understandable since we had a big party. 

I ordered a Heineken and it was served in a tall chilled glass. 

I ordered the Fish Tacos ($10.99) - 3 warm flour tortillas with battered haddock, guacamole, feta cheese, tomatoes, onions and chipotle sauce
The tacos were pretty good and the fish was a good portion on the tacos. 

Pretty nice locations, nice staff and service was pretty good and fast"}
{"text":"First time here. Must admit not a bad atmosphere. The tables aren't crammed all together so it's very spacious. Surprisingly the food is really good for pub food."}
{"text":"Half-price wing days!

Tried their red ale kettle fire flavor today (a variant on bbq sauce). Not the biggest fan of bbq sauce. Honey garlic is still my favorite. I also found that the honey garlic wings were juicier than the red ale. Hm...

Lots of people today, not just for wings, but for some kind of sporting (hockey?) thing on tv. That being said, service was slower than usual. =("}
{"text":"A solid pub with an extensive menu of greasy goodness. We usually get the appetizer platter to share since it's got a good assortment of items including potato wedges, chicken bites, and potato skins, to name a few, and can feed 5-6 people. They've got specials that change from time to time (not sure how often) in addition to the regular menu. 

The tap selection is pretty standard with nothing out of the ordinary (Coors, Canadian, Stella, Guiness etc). They've also good mixed drinks such as Caesars and various cocktails. One great thing about this location is they aren't cheap about the liquor, you can really taste it!

I've come here with large (8+) and small groups and have never had to wait seating, despite the usual lunch and dinner rush.

Parking is just outside on the lot. It also gets pretty busy during rush hours but I've never spent too much time getting a parking spot. Service is friendly but not very attentive and can be slow at times. However, they're nice when you wave them down though so I don't mind."}
{"text":"Read addendum

great food, great staff, and with the addition of some amazing new musical acts on friday and saturdays with their Live at the Fox nights, this has become the go to pub for us.
We've seen Morgan Davis, Phil Naro, Rita Di Ghent and Mark Bird Stafford live there on several occasions.  These are acts i have only seen in downtown live bars before. What a great addition to their weekends!  i don't know anywhere within 20 km putting on Emmy and Juno award winning acts on a regular basis.  Wow!

Addendum: 
They have changed ownership since my initial review. 
Live music, if it happens at all, is now sub par at best. 
The staff all quit at once after a few weeks and the place has descended into a boring Denny's with a bar overlay.
Many regulars simply stopped going and the general atmosphere is depressing."}
{"text":"We ended up here because the wait for the local buffet was too long. Glad we did. Although service was slow to start and a bit infrequent,  overall it was friendly. The original ceaser (drink) was great. We ordered the fish (2) and chips. Nicely coloured fish, not overly greasy, moist and flaky. Fries were typical. The Tex Mex burger was juicy. The soup of the day (gumbo)was amazing!! The loaded baked potato was a big let down. Small potato and sparse toppings. Totally not worth the $3.95. Dessert was great. The best one was the spice cake. Overall, was expecting mediocre pub food and was pleasantly surprised with great food."}
{"text":"They used to show the UFC fights but don't anymore. The wings are a winner here. There are a lot of different flavors that you can choose. You can get the 1 lb of wings for 1 person with one choice of flavor or you can get the 2 lbs like a real man would get with 2 different flavors. 

Good selection of beers and a large selection of liquor. The wines are mostly canadian wines but if you come here, you're gonna get beer and liquor. 

Do not get their poutine. It's just not good. Everything else on the menu is a lot better. My girlfriend got the lasagna which was decent but I'd stick more to the bar type food here. I just don't trust the Indian dish that they offer."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would! 

Rude rude rude STAFF!!!! and an extremely careless manager.

A few friends and I came here last night for half price wings and to watch the basketball game. After we got our meal (which was fine no problem there) a friend of mine asked to have his meal packed.. The waitress at the bar turns to him and says \"what are you in a rush\" stunned and surprise we continued watching the game. hardly did she come over to check on us, rolled her eyes when my friend asked for cutlery, just plain rude! 

soon after the basketball game was over hockey started, the music stopped and the commentary started for hockey. I have no problem with that at all, but when we asked another waitress who happen to pass by why they don't play basketball commentary when the games on, she responded with \"that's just how we do it around here followed with the bitchiest smirk I have ever seen!

We paid and on our way out the manager was standing at the hostess booth, we explained our horrid experience and he just brushed it off like mehhh whatever..

I refuse to come here ever again."}
{"text":"I often come here on Monday or Tuesdays for the half price wings.

While they don't serve fries with their wings, I like their wings.  I prefer the atmosphere here over the crowded places and the multiple tvs are good when watching a game.

Last time I was here though, the volume of the music was really loud so I could barely have a conversation with a person across the table.

I'm also disappointed that the pineapple curry chicken wings which I tried on my first visit here are no longer available."}
{"text":"Been a few times in the past, a bit more so when they had a wings special (not sure if they still do).

The most recent time, I came on a Friday for lunch. Server might have been a little new, because while he was friendly, he was a little long-winded when available but would otherwise disappear in between. Hard to grab our bill when the time came (and for lunch time on a work day I'd hope for faster service).

I got the Buffalo Chicken Poutine, because it sounded good, and had a 'Recommended' thumb next to it. I only found it okay though, as the fries (or more like wedges) didn't seem that great, there wasn't a lot of chicken at all and the plate was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Still a fan, but I just wanted to add that their fish tacos are great! The tacos are a good size, the fish is crispy and tastes really good, and the sauce they use is very flavourful. My new favourite dish at this place."}
{"text":"After traveling for 15 hours and landing at 10 pm, this was one of the few restaurants that was open at 11 pm. Unfortunately, it was a dud and I would not come back here.

Upon walking in, I wasn't greeted or acknowledged for a good 15-20 min. There were at least 3-4 people working (bartenders, servers), but nobody came over to give me a menu or take my order. It wasn't busy, but they were all chatting and watching a game on TV. Fail. You'd think with just one other party of 5 in the restaurant at 11 pm, they would be a little friendlier and/or attentive.

I ordered a chicken quesadilla which tasted just fine, but wasn't anything special The garden salad was lackluster with mixed greens, cucumbers, and tomatoes. I could've made a better salad at home. But the worst part of it was that it wasn't fresh. As I was eating, I discovered soggy, wilted pieces of lettuce in the middle which completely took my appetite away from finishing the rest. I suppose the bar doesn't sell very much salad, so the lettuce must sit for a while, but they should at least make sure that whatever they are selling is fresh.

Mediocre, not-so-fresh food, coupled with poor service. I won't be coming back. Perhaps if I wanted to eat bar food, drink beers, and watch a game on TV, but I'd rather drive downtown and eat somewhere that opens late instead of coming back here again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the overall dining experience. It was a nice summer day. Many people on the patio outside and just as many customers on the inside. Even though it was so busy the service was quite good.

Beef and dip $12.99 - loved the flavor of the dipping sauce for the sandwich. $2 extra for gravy. Could have used a few extra layers of beef.

Pulled pork flat bread $12.99 - great flavor on the pulled pork and loved the crispy thin crust flat bread with the gooey cheese all over it."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the waitresses there are out of it. Both times I have been there they make too many sloppy mistakes with orders and take very long to serve the food."}
{"text":"I will preface that I've been here a few times but have never left thoroughly impressed or completely disappointed. I am torn between 2 and 3 stars...the food is alright as far as pubfare goes. But let's have a peek at my most recent visit...

I came in at the end of a workweek after enduring a looooong day and forgetting to have a proper meal throughout the busy day. I wanted a burger. A big, juicy, punch me in the stomach with satisfaction burger. I wasn't greeted or seated when I walked in, so I made a beeline for the bar in front of the TV that was playing the rangers and capitals game. Bartender wasn't very chatty and neither was I; we both probably had had enough of this day but the stark difference was I wasn't on the clock anymore. He was totally unattentive, unfocused, and had a general air of 'idgaf'. My bf was annoyed by the crap service...there were only 7 people seated at the bar including us. Do your beer inventory later if you cannot multitask or just look up once and awhile to realize patrons are attempting to get your attention.

And if you were wondering, the whiskey burger was satisfying and so are the wings. Good job, BOH! Bad job, FOH, bad!"}
{"text":"further from the DT one, about 10 km.

Known for their wings and Whiskey BBQ burgers."}
{"text":"3 stars for service only; food was completely sub par. Paid a lot of money for no heart/no anything pertaining to food. Take it from a world traveler during the week who also bartends at shitty but classic pubs when home on weekends. Come here to drink NOT eat! You have been warned! Drink the booze skip the food! To the owner... \"tighten up\"! (Again from experience; ownership doesn't care, they want to suck the money out of the place and sell it)"}
{"text":"So it's a low-key Friday night out with my squad for some celebratory birthday drinks for my girl.  Since we were all coming from various directions across the city, we decided that this spot would be a mutually convenient meeting ground for us all.

A friend of mine made reservations a few days in advance without a problem, but we didn't end up needing it since it was a gorgeous day outside and we decided to soak up the sun on the patio.

With a casual pub style ambience, it was serving a fair amount of patrons both inside and out.  Being a Friday night, they were hosting live musicians to entertain the outdoor crowd for the evening. but to be honest, they only played a few songs and nothing too outstanding at that. 

Our waitress was attentive and polite and offered her suggestions on cocktails.  We ordered everything from draft beers to cocktails to shots...just a side note:  the sangria was cider based and not wine based.  Most of us were just feeling like some apps, so we placed an order for the fare platter, calamari and Mediterranean nachos.  It was definitely enough to feed nine chatty girls, but as for the level of quality and taste...it was subpar to say the least :(

Overall, a nice spot to grab a drink after work, but be mindful of the typical bar food."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Bar!! I actually like the food, good portion.. chicken wings is great!!! Plus not extremely busy so nice to go there for a date.."}
{"text":"Came here two more times since my original visit. We sat indoors these times. Service was better and faster. Food was also good. Their beef pot pie in Guinness sauce was good."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Fox & Fiddle after a quick dinner at Kelsey's down the street. I'm kind of surprised at the mediocre reviews for this place because my experience wasn't bad at all. We happened to be here during half-priced wings night so a lot of friends decided on wings with some pitchers. We ordered the standard pitchers of Miller, Canadian and Rickards. The frozen apple pie and pumpkin pie cocktail drinks were great and fairly priced. The mac & cheese was really great and seemed above average for pub food. The waitress was nice and she checked up on our group several times. We left after having a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The location is convenient for me work-wise, and we sometimes find ourselves here for a bev after work, and it's a good spot for that. I've come here for lunch a couple of times and it's busy but not packed. 
I've tried some of the food here and it is standard pub fare. The fish n chips were just OK, the fish was really batter-y but not the crispy batter like I enjoy, it was kind of...fluffier? Still tasty, mind you. Fries were meh. I had the 'gourmet' grilled cheese (two slices of cheese, tomatoes, bacon on whole grain) and I was very disappointed. This was not gourmet, it was soggy and the cheese was not melted at all. Sad that they charge $13.95 (just as much as the burger!!) for this thing. Might try the burger next time...I have heard good things about it, and it can't be as bad as the grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked with all of the negative reviews. This place has very friendly staff, they are very accommodating and the food is delicious. Really enjoyed spending time here and eating. Will come back for sure."}
