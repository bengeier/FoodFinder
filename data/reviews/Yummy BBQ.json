{"text":"Not many options in this area, but you could do worse.  Decent Menu Items: * Kimchi Stew * Pork Bone Soup * Spicy Rice Cakes * Stir-fried Pork with Vegetables * Side dishes (always nice and average - never amazing; never horrible) I never go wrong with these items.   Ambiance:        Meh.... This place is about the food, not a first-date. Photos of menu items and prices on the wall. Garage sale worthy chairs and table. Small TVs playing K-pop videos on a loop.  Service:        Hit and Miss. Revolving door of servers working here. I usually don't end with the same server twice."}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ is a good place if you're looking for decent food at decent prices.   Their lunch specials, priced at $4.99 to $5.99, are great deals for tasty and relatively healthy meals. I've had their kalbi (beef ribs) special a few times and it can be hit or miss - 2/3 times the meat was very fatty.  The Yummy BBQ special is a great value - you get LOTS of food for the price. I don't think one person can finish the entire combo in one sitting, lol.  Their pork bone soup is decent, but I've only had it once and it contained more bones compared to other Korean restaurants.  Service is quick but cordial.  The decor could use some work, but the place seems clean.  Overall, Yummy BBQ is decent value for your money."}
{"text":"We came with 3 people and so I ask for another side dish and the waitress say we have to share that side dish. I am not happy about it. Never come back here again. At the Owl they give out free unlimited side dish. Learn from them if you want more customers to come back."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and large portions!  This is the ideal combination for any students who live around the neighborhood. The food is decent, and there are lots of side dishes to munch on."}
{"text":"Not too sure what to think of this place. Although I initially enjoyed it, I don't really see myself coming back here. The lunch special is quite cheap though, so that remains an option. I find that all the meats taste exactly the same, and it lacks a certain depth. The BBQ meats are grilled on a mini stove top, and doesn't taste very grilled. The side dishes aren't bad, and there remains many other Korean dishes to try. I would say give it a try, but don't be disappointed if it all tastes the same to you."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ Pork lunch special with Kimchi and Tofu sides.  Go here at least 4 times a month with co-workers."}
{"text":"It's Korean fast food.  It's cheap, it's fast and it tastes great.  You don't go there for the atmosphere.  But if it's a choice between the typical North American version of fast food (Rotten Ronnie's or whatever you care to insert here) and this, then there really is no choice.  The price is probably about the same, the food is far better at Yummy BBQ and there is actually some nutritional value (it's not the exclusive salt, fat and sugar that is contributing to the ballooning North American morphology).  I go there for a bibimbap once in a while.    There's also a location in the Crossways at Dundas West.  Same deal."}
{"text":"Agh.   Friend and I were debating where to grab a simple dinner on Yonge St.. and apparently this place had good reviews (it must've been another of its locations).   It was terrible.   Decor aside, the temperature inside was a bit chilly.. and many patrons had to keep their jackets on.   Perhaps we should've ordered BBQ items, but alas, we didn't.   We got:   1) Tofu stew: so, so, so far off from the authentic Korean tofu stew that it was depressing. Can't even compare to places like Seor Ak San (go there instead!!)   2) Dumpling soup: okay so my friend made a bad menu choice, but it came in this baby blue bowl with noodles, egg, and a few meat dumplings. It looked bland as ever.   Came with a few kimchi side dishes but those were just terrible too.   So disappointing."}
{"text":"This place offers tasty food in this neighbourhood. I have taken some friends here and all of they gave positive feedbacks. Price is reasonable. But the service is too slow for dine in, so I always order take out food. Fast, tasty, and convenient.   BBQ dishes for meat lovers and mixed rice for vegetarians are must try."}
{"text":"After a long absence (winter sucks), I revisited this place for lunch and bought the BBQ ribs lunch special for $6.99.  The meal came with a generous portion of grilled Korean ribs, rice and a choice of two side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, macaroni salad, pickled radish.)  They ask if you want it the ribs spicy or not.  The food arrives quickly and efficiently.  The ribs are slightly too sweet and there's not enough heat, despite the ribs being coated in red, chilli sauce.  Since there was a few of us and we ordered different side dishes, I was able to sample more than two of them.  Here goes... Kimchi: plentiful, nice and tangy, medium spice, it does its job.  Beansprouts: again, there's a decent amount, not as oily as other places (that's good) and surprisingly fresh.  Tofu: two small pieces of tofu topped with green onions in a soy based sauce were delicious.  Unfortunately, there were only two small pieces.  Macaroni salad: it's macaroni salad.  Meh.  Pickled radish: this side dish is a good counterpoint to the ribs, I'd order this again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service,No one speaks English there at all..they don't care about you at all and I saw a mouse run by the kitchen when waiting for food."}
{"text":"Went there several times. The old guy at the cashier told my friend that they don't take credit card and almost threw my friend's card at his face, and then he yelled at us for not giving him tips. Lol only two waitress there during the busiest dinner hour on weekends, we had to wave hundred times just to ask for a cup of water."}
{"text":"We go there all the time, I love it.  The  decor is kind of greasy-Korean-spoon, which I like, I'm not pretentious.  The service is good, always smiling, and pretty attentive.  love the food, fantastic.  my gf lives the pork bone soup and I love the beef.  So good.  We're always surprised when we get the bill at how little it costs to dine.  it's always under thirty for the two, including tip.   The only thing that bothers me is the repetitive Korean music videos.  They drive me insane, lol.  highly recommend."}
{"text":"There BBQ is the best ever. I swear it's cocaine! Get the 2 or 3 BBQ item combo. The bbq ribs and pork are insanely delicious. The decor is casual the staff is friendly. I've brought my friends here and they have joined the addicted club. You will to!"}
{"text":"I've got a problem - two problems, actually. The first is that I am awful at venturing outside of my neighbourhood to try new restaurants (ideal distance is approximately 67 steps). The second is that I am inhumanely addicted to Yummy BBQ (approximately 43 steps).   It's probably not the best idea for me to learn all about Korean food through an establishment that might be correctly described as the McDonalds of Korean (no wait - that's Korean BBQ - it's way better than that!). I'm not sure how authentic it is, but it's sooo goooood.   There are tons of menu options - rice dishes, noodle dishes, bibimbap, BBQ combos, bulgogi, soups - but I'm usually faithful to the kimchi stew. SO GOOD!! I hear the pork bone soup is a real crowd pleaser.   As with every Korean restaurant, the meal starts with three banchan (usually tofu, kimchi and pickled radish). MY FAVOURITE PART.  Anyhoods, the place isn't fancy and like I said, I think it's kinda the fast food version of Korean but I loves it. Three times a week loves it. That's loyalty, nerds."}
{"text":"I traveled from USA without a cash and stopped by this place. When I went some places, everywhere accepted a credit card. Unfortunately this place did not. It is ok  and I understand some place does a tax evasion. A problem is there was no sign saying they were not accepting a credit card.  When I tried to pay at a counter, I saw a small little paper, they only accepted a cash or debit. Of course I did not have the cash and I said I was not notified I could not use my credit card. After that, they treated me as a homeless and they wanted to hold my ID which I needed when I used at my hotel and business place. Anyway I did a cash advance on my credit card and they finally released my ID. Food was little below an average. All staffs were really rude.  Canada goverment shoudl do audit on tax evasion for this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork bone soup for lunch and everything was just mediocre. The soup didn't really have any flavor besides salt and spice and there weren't any potatoes to be found anywhere in the dish. I was really disappointed, but the service and the amount of pork served was decent."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for pork bone soup. The price is pretty standard but in comparison to other places, their serving size is definitely bigger. Our orders usually come with 3-4 big pieces of pork. The soup is  flavourful and distinct from other places. If you like spice, you can request for spicy because mild is well.. very mild. To sum it up, it's cheap, convenient and most importantly, delicious!"}
{"text":"After a few visits, this place has yet to disappoint.  Tasty food, decent service, and really good lunch specials.  The BBQ pork is always a winner.  I went here with a few Korean buddies and they all gave it their thumbs up.  As well,  they have a fermented rice/wheat drink (Makgeolli?) that one friend told me is pretty tough to find in Toronto, so you might want to to try it if you're looking for a pretty unique taste experience (though I believe the drink runs $10-15, so be warned)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place after he had lunch here.  I have lived in the neighbourhood for many years now but I have never once came to this place becoz its appearance on the yonge street is awful.  I'm glad I didn't insist on not going this place again when my boyfriend suggested it, i have been eating at this place for straight 3 days since.  People have different tastes, my boyfriend likes sweet dishes so BBQ Grill and stir fries here are perfect for him, however, if you don't liketoo much sugar in your food, fyi like me, you should try the pork bone soup here instead, it's way better than pork bone soup at ka chi, the soup is so so tasty.  They also have very fresh rice cake here, I always ordered the beef stir fried rice cake. It's quite sweet, so look out if you don't like your food too sweet.  I have no complaints at all for the food or the price. Yet there is something they can improve on, such as decoration, add veggies to their pork bone soup, have more salty dishes.   I am probably going back again tonight. I love this place. :)"}
{"text":"My ONLY complaint is that they stop BBQ items fairly early, twice in a row we were too late. The ribs are top notch, as is the bbq chicken.I plan on expanding on my menu choices next visit (tomorrow) Very polite and welcoming staff , generous servings. Not fancy, but clearly a family owned business that I enjoy."}
{"text":"What kind of BBQ joint runs out of BBQ? Old man working the cash doesn't have any explanation for it. Just a blatant no BBQ! The cockiness and arrogance of this new management is so disrespectful."}
{"text":"I love the food and been on this restaurant many times.  I am giving this a low rating simply because of poor customer service.  I ordered for two BBQ short ribs to go and when they were packing my order I have asked for an extra kimchi as they only gave one.  And I heard the guy in the kitchen screaming  and trying at the girl in the front.  I told her that if it's a big hassle then forget it.  We often dine in and if we ask for this, there won't be a problem....  She just smiled (probably didn't understand what I said). Very poor customer service. Not going back to this place.  There are a lot of Korean BBQ places around that could serve better their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever met. We've been waiting for our order that only contains two simple dishes for almost 40 mins. Super upset about it."}
{"text":"I took my friend here who has never experienced Korean food.  She ordered the bulgogi with rice.  There was lots of meat.  Her only complaint was that this dish doesn't come with any vegetables.  I ordered the jap chae with beef but asked for no rice.  My dish didn't haven't much meat though.  Size was good and most prices of dishes less than $10. The dining area is has photos of the food all over the wall which is helpful for people not familiar with Korean food.  Other people ordered their bbq so maybe I will try this the next time I go as this is what they're known for."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for some quick, delicious and cheap Korean food!  Usually the bf and I just get take-out from this place (not keen on dining in as the restaurant itself is decorated like a fast food joint).    We opt for the house special (the Yummy BBQ special) which comes in a gigantic box of bbq kalbi ribs, beef bulbogi and bbq chicken pieces, along with side dishes of fried tofu drenched with spices, zucchini tempura, gyoza, and bean sprouts.  They also pack other side dishes including a little containers of kimchi, macaroni salad, and preserved radishes. Also included in the package is a big serving of white rice.  The house special contains enough food for my bf and I without even needing to order anything else.  The quality of the bbq depends, as it can vary in degrees of well-done, but usually it is done quite well with some minimal burning on the sides of the meat.  The taste is authentic, and I am a big fan of the kalbi, kimchi and gyoza.  I recommend this to anyone craving some kbbq without wanting to spend the time/money to go to an AYCE kbbq place."}
{"text":"Korean fast food at it's finest!  It was cold out and I wanted Korean BBQ.  But since I couldn't have all you can eat, I decided to go to Yummy.  Cheap and cheerful, if you're hungry, the Yummy Special hits the spot. It's the perfect size for two... carnivores.  If you are vegetarian then you are out of luck.  The Yummy Special is a great deal for 13 bucks which I usually order spicy. It comes with short-ribs, chicken, and spicy beef.... A few dumplings, some deep fried slices of zucchini in egg batter. Tofu, a mini macaroni salad, rice, and of course kimchee...  Sure, all the meat sort of tastes the same.... the tofu is a bit salty... and the zucchini is a bit soggy....  But it doesn't matter. It's a great option for Korean comfort food."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night at 8pm and they RAN OUT OF MEAT. We thought we must have caught them on a weird night, but reading other reviews now it seems that this happens quite often. This basically limits the option of the restaurant to very few dishes as it IS called \"yummy BBQ\"... ordered the Kimchi fried rice, and it was very mediocre.   Very, very poor management and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My favourite pork bone soup restaurant in Toronto. Very delicious and the price is good. It seems like they increase the price a little bit, but it is still cheaper than other restaurants. The bbq for two people is good too. I came here at least 10 times. Love it!"}
{"text":"too oily for topoki rice cake , i also order spicy stirfry squid with tofu n kimchi to go for lunch special. but it happen  only vegetable on spicy sauce on it . seriously im so dissaponted. i dont mind they charge normal price but if order something u expect your order will came according what u want. will never ever  come this place anymore. the worse korean food i ever haved"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever received.. 1)When I asked for a plate to put the short rib bones, the waitress refused and told us to put it on a piece of napkin 2) when we asked for another box to take home, she said \"why?\" 3) after asking for hot sauce twice, it never came 4) she never checked up on us once  Enough said. I've been a server myself and I don't care how shitty your day was, it's your job as a server to be helpful and not be a b*tch. Her attitude and poor service is the reason I will never come back to this place again. There are plenty of Korean restaurants out there that I will gladly go to."}
{"text":"I used to be their customer regularly, sadly they are worst day by day. First of all the portion became lesser and lesser . Even for the beef soup the rice noodle is only few. For the side dishes some time they used to pack 2 or some time 4 as per their mood. Worst thing is they used to put twice kimchi side dishes. In terms of cleanness of food , some times they have small hair inside the food , for me I got twice hair in my pork bone soup and stir fry beef. For the packaging they used to missed chopstick or napkin or both. When u called back their is no apology and asking u want chopstick ? What the heck u want me to eat stuff by hand. Disgusting. When u used to be their r ghost customer they used to forget basic manner like thank u etc... and seeing the same face everyday they have felling of bore. I am not going back to this restaurant again . Worst in over all experience. One more thing to high light, there is a man who used to take take order over the phone , I think his English is not good and beside when taking the order sound so rude..."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Very delicious and authentic tasting : ) the service isn't the best service because of all the times I've been there, waitresses have been pretty harsh like they expect yu to know their menu already...BUT on the flip side, they greet you when you come in and their food makes up for everything else. Not a bad place to take your date to (not really recommended) but an absolutely GREAT place to go out with friends. (The very first time i went, an order came out with spicy beef sizzling ontop of a hot plate, my friend and i couldnt stop drooling and inhaling the wonderful aroma!) But anyway... the food portions are very generous and the prices are extremely cheap and reasonable : ) oh! And takeout order is also available. would I come again?? I've already been 4 times this week : p"}
{"text":"The food itself is okay. But the service is terrible. Had to wait 1 hour to get the food after ordering. When we asked for a refill of side dishes (which arrived at the beginning) they said they don't do refills. Even after making us wait one hour."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with a friend and had their lunch special!  The deal is pretty good $6.50 (after tax) for a plate of rice with stir fried veggies and your choice of protein!   The portion is great and I felt full after eating my plate. I asked for it to be spicy as well but found it was the perfect spice level that it wasn't overbearing in flavour.   Overall, a great place to go for a light lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Yummy BBQ for many years and it's still one of my top Korean picks. It is by far, not a fancy place though; it's quite shabby, but the food is great!  My favorite dish is that absolutely HUGE Yummy Special which includes a bit of every BBQ meat they offer plus sides and your usual selection of Banchan.   More recently, I went with a group and we decided to change things up and one of our orders was the large skillet of Kimchi Rice. I was floored by how good this was and it's inspired me to start making Kimchi Rice at home as well. I'm sure you can find other good Korean places around Toronto but if you are in this particular part of Town, Yummy BBQ is your best Korean option!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this place. Every time I go there's no bbq left. What kind of a bbq place don't have bbq? That's like a chocolate factory running out of chocolate.  Completely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"i just wish i can give a zero star to this place. I used to be a regular, yet i will NEVER go there(i swear to god). a friday of last month, i went there with 4 friends around 6. there werent that much people. we ordered beer and bbq. i waited for almost half and hour and yet out bbq is not done. people come later than us all got their food. so we asked server to speed up our order since we had other business that night. the server told us that making bbq takes time and ofc we knew that and i had been half an hour passed. the server was so rude and then asked us to leave right way. how could you on earth serve ppl like that???? you could v just make sugguestions on other faster dishes or just tell us to be patient. but tell us to leave????excuse me? i will never go back again and i warn all of you that want to go to this place: you are desevered to be treated better! dont fking go there! i would rather eat MC than this."}
{"text":"One of the best price/quality ratio. I typically order the chicken bibimbap, at $7.95, so plus tax and tip you're looking at approx $10 for a meal that can be split into 2. They serve large portions, with great side dishes. The Yummy special is great for those that have a voracious appetite. The service isn't what you're here for, neither is the cleanliness. Your feet will be slipping and sliding on the greasy floor, but you will leave happy and satiated without a massive dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"We came with a group of 20 during lunch, and was almost refused service because they didn't want to serve a large group that was ordering BBQ. They stated that they only had two nets in the kitchen so they could not serve everyone \"at the same time\", and that there may be other customers coming in later.  In the end, they ended up with a compromise: we could choose any of the other dishes besides the BBQ. Of course, they weren't served up at the same time either.  I asked a few people from our group that came a bit later to just grab another table separate from the rest of us to see what kind of service they would get, and they were all given their BBQ orders no problem. So it seems like it was ok if several unrelated groups were to order BBQ, but it's not ok if they were all together.  So if you're coming in a large group (12+) to a restaurant called \"Yummy BBQ\" and are looking to order BBQ, you'll probably want to split up beforehand.  I ended up ordering a bowl of spicy beef soup. There wasn't much beef inside and it had the texture of pulled beef. Comes with a bowl of rice so that you can dip it with the soup, which was ok."}
{"text":"First off, I prefer the location at The Crossways on Dundas and Bloor. With that said, if I'm in the area - depending on how hungry I am and what the other options are - I may stop in. My personal favs are the fish cutlet, and chicken or beef BBQ combos. The macaroni salad that comes as a side is sooooo good. When they get the food right, it's a super duper meal.   However, communication with the servers are difficult at times. Sometimes they run out of food. Like what? It just doesn't make sense to me sometimes! Which is why this spot is only A-OK to me."}
{"text":"Terribly sick afterwards with couple of days of a stomach virus.  Need I say anything else?"}
{"text":"A nondescript joint close to Wellesley station, that fuels your appetite with a dose of Korean BBQ and is nothing short of comfort with a side of a kick.  The staff is welcoming and the ambience is relaxed - which is perfect when you don't want to think of dressing up.   We ordered the house grilled platter which was pretty reasonably priced at around $23 I believe and enough to feed 2 people. It came with 2 scoops of steamed rice and the goodness of 3 spiced BBQ items: Kalbi, Bulgogi and chicken. Also included in the platter was some tempura and 2 gyozas. Not to forget, also accompanied were the usual suspects such as kimchi, sprouts, tofu.   All in all, I would visit again when I'm craving meat, want polite service and don't have the patience to dress up - that seems pretty welcoming in all aspects :)"}
{"text":"Always really enjoyed the food here thoroughly. Done Takeout and ate in person a few times. Taken friends here and they loved the food, including a vegetarian friend. Kalbi is great, so are the stews. Korean stews can be super delicious, and I've had their soondoobu chigae, and kimchi chigae. Not the best Korean Ive ever had, but the best Ive had so far in Toronto.  Ambience not so nice, looks ugly. Went in once on a warm day and decided not to eat there because of the no-air conditioning."}
{"text":"Don't get me started ...  I normally rate on the service and environment/decor, but who cares when this place has the best Korean beef bbq short ribs!!! It's legit! The place is nearby my work and I always crave for it for lunch! I find myself pre-ordering for take out days in a row because the beef ribs are that good. Try it! Yummmmmyyyy for real lol. Order number one. Please :)"}
{"text":"Digital camera pictures of their food selection on the wall- I should have known. When you're eating at a place like this, you know not to expect much. I had hoped it might be a charming little hole in the wall, which are some of my favourite kinds of places to eat, but it is not. Service is lacking and the place just feels unclean. Food isn't terrible but my desire to attend is lessened by the poor atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered much...i ate not so much. I am not a fan of their food or price. Food was edible but no where on noteworthy level. The portion was decent. I ordered a pork bone soup; it was lukewarm, the meat was rough and lack a good soup base. The spicy rice cake was alright, but was a little too sweet and veg too hard. The shrimp fried rice was the best out of the meal. It was well seasoned and well made. The side dishes were typical, however the kimchi was overly fermented thus leaving a strong alcoholy taste. Overall, I wouldn't ordered the same dishes but might give it another try just to give it another chance."}
{"text":"As I said previously, BE CAREFUL about eating their food because or their lack of hygiene/cleanliness..  I have witnessed over time that the owner is racist against the Chinese and especially against the Japanese customers. Giving preferential service to anyone who is Korean.  Get over it!!! The war was over decades ago.  If you are Asian, you are taking a chance as to the kind of customer service you are going to get. It depends on HIS mood."}
{"text":"Close to yonge and Wellesley, this Korean restaurant is one of my preferred places in the area when in the mood for Korean food. I had a 2 person mild stirred meat pot and it was delicious. The meat was cooked just right, and sauce had a nice sweetness to it. The wide variety of side dishes were some of the most delicious side dishes I've had compared to other Korean restaurants. The service was also very good -- and the free Wi-Fi is a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"First time dining there for lunch.   Group of 4.   It is a small restaurant. Similar size to owl of minevera on yonge and finch. The service was okay. Our server did not speak much English.   We ordered pork bone soup and the lunch beef special.   The pork bone soup was good. However it did not come with Potato like owl of minevera. They gave us a small plate to dispose of the bones. Which became messy after.   The lunch special was not that appealing. It tastes okay. The dish consisted of rice on one side and the beef or whatever your choice of meat was on the other.   It is more of a take out Place than a sit in."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, however the owner and management are cheap as $&@?.    I use to be a regular until I came with a group and we ordered the big bbq with assorted meats.  We also ordered beer and soju...  so we were a $80 table for 3ppl.  Not one of those low end tables.  The problem was not the service or the promptness of food arrival, but the fact we didn't get side dishes at all.  We asked the server and why and they said they ran out.   There may have been a mishap in the kitchen said one of the servers and she may have dropped it.  I think owner blamed/punished the server.   Clearly though there was still sides because I saw at least 3 other tables getting side dishes after we asked both servers if we could get our side dishes.  She replied she didn't have any when clearly they did.  They offered to give us pop to compensate, but I kindly replied we are drinking alcohol and don't need pop.  WTH, I was eating meat and rice...  nothing to compliment my food.  People that eat Korean food know the importance of side dishes which are usually limitless to an extent.  This place charges if you want extra if you want refills and here I was getting no side dishes at all!  Are you telling me that the kitchen can't whip up any sides dishes or has run out of kimchi.  I wasn't expecting a discount from this mom and pop place, but could expect a sincere apology from the owner.  Actually I should expect a discount of the price side dishes taken off my bill.  He's always standing at the back, counting his money and micromanaging his staff, with a huge scowl on his face.  Owners like him shouldn't be in this business and I hope new management takes over.   Though I love the food and don't mind the service/staff, I will never go there again unless the management changes."}
{"text":"Came with friends after playing board games. We were about 10 people and waited for a while to get seated even though it wasn't a busy place. The menu was pretty typical Korean: BiBimBap, Pork Bone Soup, Stews, those large casserole dishes, Stir Fried dishes and of course their famous BBQ dishes. The waitress first brought some side dishes, which includes Kim Chi, Pickled Radish, Tofu, marinated Bean Sprout and Potato salad. Unlike other Korean restaurant, there's no free refill for side dishes. After 10-15 mins, our dishes finally arrived. I've ordered the BBQ combo 2 meat with Chicken and Short Ribs. It was literally just that with rice.  The meat was uncut, so I had to chew the whole thing. Luckily it was really tendered, so not too hard on my teeth. The taste was pretty good, and it would have been easier if they gave me a spoon for my rice. Overall it was OK, definitely need some improvement on the service. Their lunch special is almost the same, just a small price difference. I will probably come here during lunch time only."}
{"text":"Good food quality, waitresses are generally friendly.  We came in for dinner Saturday night, sat down and ordered.  Some Korean ladies came in after us, not only did they get their order before us but they were served tea after us asking twice for it! Wish I spoke korean! Asked for appetizer dishes because we were hungry as we were told they were busy bad had to wait 30 minutes for our food. They never came!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad. I always go there 2-3 times a week, but I phoned in one Saturday and they gave my food to other ppl, when I got there, they told me food is gone u have to wait another 30 mins for it................."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a big group on a Saturday night.  There are places that have bad service but this place has absolutely dreadful service.   Business at the restaurant wasn't busy and We were a group of 10 and we waited around the waiting area for what felt like 5 minutes before we were acknoledged.  There was not enough seating at one table for our large group, so we split up into two groups (one group of 4 and one group of 6).  When the waitress came to take orders, she only too orders at the table for 4 and somehow forgot to take orders at the table for 6.  Only when they started serving the Korean side dishes at the table of 4 did they send someone over to take orders at our table of 6.  Some Korean restaurants have a bell at the tables and they don't disturb you unless you ring the bell, which is ok, but Yummy BBQ doesn't have a Bell!  The lack of service was absolutely head scratching.  When the food came, it was pretty good.  The side dishes were a set of 5 trays (kimchi, white turnip, tofu, bean sprouts, etc, I liked the tofu).  I ordered a Yummy special to share.  The Yummy special plate was good.  It came with two rice and there was chicken and beef and ribs on the plate.  The portions was large and there was enough food to share it between two people.  To add the the horrible service, When we finished our food and requested seperate bills, we were asked to go up to the front and pay.  In terms of food and value for food, Yummy BBQ is actually ok.  However, the lack of service was astounding.  From my past reviews, I would have mainly focused on the food and Yummy would have probably scored a 3, but the service was so awful (possibly the worst service I've had in over a year... and I go to some Chinese eateries with pretty lousy service) I feel I have no choice but to drop their score.  1.4 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Okay let me say i used to be a frequent regular here. The food quality is so bad its not even funny and the huge price increases too. The servers were friendly and checked on you even though busy on a Saturday night. The side dishes we only touched the tofu with soy sauce which was still amazing like i liked but unfortunately the bbq chicken and beef ribs were bad quality meats. Would not return again."}
{"text":"The food is decent if you don't mind the heavy sauces. Their chilled tofu is tasty. Besides that, everything is quite pricey for a hole in the wall. The owner is probably the rudest person you will ever meet in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Lunch specials rock. From open to 3pm u can get beef stir fried with veggies cooked with red pepper sauce on rice  (soooo yummy) for only $5 tax included. Don't know why this place doesn't have a long line at lunch. Luv luv this place!"}
{"text":"I live across the street and visit this joint occassionally. Tbe food is tasty, but the owner a scoundrel. He closes the shop whenever he wants and mostly makes excuses about having no bbq left or rice etc. He reminds customers through a million sticky notes across the washrooms about \"Tipping\". I have never been to a place that has a note on the cover of the menu about \"Tipping\"..... I usually like Koreans, but I guess he is one of the bad apples who gives his community a bad rep. Too bad, that such a great business is run by such a moron!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place as the food was decent and cheap, but I'll never be going again thanks to the manager.  I arrived a little bit before 8:30pm on a Tuesday night with 11 people including myself. I host a weekly event around the area so we sometimes come here after. Restaurant looked a little bit busy, but there was lots of seating available. At first the server looked a bit troubled but combined a table and let us sit. 5 minutes after we all sat down and were looking over the menu, the server comes back and says because we didn't make a reservation, we weren't going to be served. Excuse me, what? Despite being regular customers, despite having slightly higher numbers before without problems, and worst of all having seated us already, we were kicked out.  Speaking as a past server, I understand that taking care of large groups (though 11 isn't even that much) can be difficult but really? I have a hunch that the owner is racist, as a lot of the guests with me were Japanese. Some of the other reviews pointed out Korean guests being served first, and that has actually happened before.  For shame."}
{"text":"I got a pork bone soup (mild) for $7.95 I believe. There were a lot of pork in my soup and I couldn't even finish my meal in a setting. The soup was flavourful, not the usual pork bone soup kind of flavour I would get from other Korean restaurants. The level of spicy-ness though, mild is literally mild, I would order medium or spicy next time."}
{"text":"My second vist to this place. The first I came, stir fried chicken and I was not too impressed. This time ordered the BBQ chicken and spare ribs and it was yummy. This is only Korean restaurant I know that don't give refills on side dishes."}
{"text":"I disagree with the other reviewer.  Maybe their meal was not good but I have been here multiple times and had a great cheap meal.  The pork bone soup is wonderful.  The korean music videos are hilarious. The service is not bad.  For the price you can't go wrong here.  Try the cheap pork bone soup, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good BBQ chicken, a must try if you ever visit. Pork bone soup less attractive compared to other Korean counterparts (less materials, no potato). They recently raise the price on the menu, or else it's five stars!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 8pm.  Was half full with two waitresses.  We had to find our own seats and had to waive multiple times for the waitress to take our order.  After taking our order food started to come out around 15 min mark and one of my friends got his around the 40 min mark.  Tea is free but getting refills took forever.  Food tasted good, portion size was good and price was decent.  I got the stir fry squid and shrimp $10 and would probably get it again in a future visit. Side dishes were good too but will cost $2.50 per side dish if you want another round.  Hopefully the service will improve the next time I am there.  Would avoid if restaurant is busy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  I ordered the lunch special BBQ short ribs with rice.  It came with side dishes: tofu and bean sprouts.  The portions were pretty big.  The taste was pretty good.  The ribs were tender.  It was pretty good value. The lunch specials are from 11am to 3pm Mon to Sun.  The service was so-so. They didn't re-fill your tea automatically. You have to flag down the wait staff.  There were two wait staff at the time and the restaurant was almost empty.  But the food came out at a decent time. Will come back."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, Yummy BBQ is there because you're hungry and you want big quantities of KBBQ with no pretence. Straight forward Korean food with no added service. And sometimes, that's ok.  Yummy BBQ may not have the best interior and exterior for a Korean restaurant, nor will it impress anyone with it's service. But what it does offer is the best bang for the buck. Compared to other Korean restaurants in downtown, Yummy BBQ's value could not be beat. For a main dish that includes Kalbi beef and spicy chicken, your total damage will not exceed $25. The food itself lacks elegance and depth in flavour, but it is by no means bland. Different spice levels are provided for some dishes, allowing you to customize to your palette, but what that really means is how much sauce will be on the meat (choose medium).   However, the problem that knocks off stars for this restaurant is definitely the attentiveness and the level of service. For even a presumably empty restaurant, staff was not attentive enough to provide water, napkins, or really any form of care. What's really shocking is the fact that they tend to run out of BBQ hours before the closing time. It's appalling that a \"barbecue\" restaurant can run out of meat in the middle of service. It seems like this problem has only arisen recently, but continues to be a problem. Many of my friends, me included, will call in advance to inquire about the status of the kitchen prior to arriving.   It's a shame that which such good values, that a restaurant like this do not put more emphasizes on service and managerial proficiencies. And maybe that's why it's so cheap. But if Yummy BBQ improved on these points, it would be the hottest Korean spot in downtown."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place from when it was just one hole in the wall place on the ground floor of an apt building at Dundas West and Roncesvalles some 18 years ago.  Since then they've opened 4-5 other locations throughout the city and I've had the pleasure of trying this one and the other Yonge St location.    Can't say I love all their food because I haven't tried everything on their menu and the main reason I go to Yummy BBQ is, well, for their BBQ combos.  Reading previous reviews by some people, I'm not sure why anyone would walk into a BBQ restaurant and order deep fried fish cutlet.  And \"most of the items are greasy and deep fried\"???  This is certainly a news to me.  But I digress.  They offer great selection of BBQ items you can choose from.  My personal fav are spicy chicken and galbi combo (or 2 meat combo).  For around $11, you get 2 scoops (yes, like ice cream scoops) of rice, kimchi, stir fried cabbage and sweet mashed potatoes.  If you're looking for quick Korean meal, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Best Korean Kalbi ribs in the world!!  I've been to Toronto 3 times. Every time my fiance and I come here we have to feed the craving for this place.  From memory the Kalbi ribs are ~$13 for a HUGE order.  Where I live in Cincinnati, Kalbi ribs run any where from $16 to $19 and you get half of what you get at this place.   To put things in perspective when we go to Toronto, if we have 9 meals out to eat over the course of three days 5 of those meals will be Korean at Yummy's   The combination of delicious food, generous ban chan (still haven't figured out what the cole slaw/mayonaise type ban chan side is, must be a Canadian thing) and friendly service make this a must stop destination in Toronto.  The woman who work here are always so friendly and nice, you really feel welcomed. Go, eat, repeat. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"YUMMY!! Out of all the places we ate at in Toronto, this was the best. Best food esp for what we paid, decent service. Wait staff could've smiled more but it's an Asian restaurant, I don't expect the service to be great. (BTW, I'm Asian!)  Loved all the meat. My mouth is watering thinking about how delicious it was!"}
{"text":"Spoke to the owner today, looks like the landlord was overcharging rent and now is being disputed in court"}
{"text":"When you eat their bbq dishes you really taste that taste that comes from charcoal. The real reason for the 2 star is the service though. Before I get into that, the food is good and the portions are huge. It's definitely satisfying and the price to taste ratio is amazing.   Now... the wait times and customer service aren't great, as stated in other reviews. I've been here a lot and will continue to go back when I want that cheap/large meat dish, but really, I should be ready to wait, and possibly be okay with having an argument with the owner.   Sometimes, I'm okay with that. hahahah"}
{"text":"Huge portions that came with a lot of side dishes.  The foods pretty good for the price"}
{"text":"I went here with a group and we were blown away with the ridiculous portion sizes and never ending flow of yummy goodness. Seating is alright, but getting a party of 10+ might be difficult depending on when you're going. The place doesn't have much in terms of ambiance, but it does have kpop playing almost exclusively which lightens things up.   We did have an issue with a waitress which was the result of a severe communication barrier. Basically, someone asked for a knife to cut their stake, and was given a pair of dirty hobby scissors instead. Also, some orders were completely wrong, so after a quite few of these hiccups another waitress stepped in.  The communication barrier really is no excuse for bad service. Maybe get some Koren- Canadians instead of using useless international students/ tfw's"}
{"text":"Ordered: Egg Battered Beef   Food: 2/5  It's not good but it's not bad but there's really no twist to it. It's just egg battered beef with rice.   The first Korean restaurant that i went to that charges people for refilling the small dishes.   Service: 2.5/5 It is okay, they aren't very attentive, may need one more employee to help out.   Price: 2.5/5  Paid 13 for my egg battered beef, it's not too expensive but it isn't all that good. Just don't think it's worth the amount I paid for. I would rather spend this money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and cheap.  I live in the area and, having eaten here a countless number of times, recommend it.  I almost always get either the bibimbap with chicken or the pork bone soup, both of which cost only $9 including tax and tip.  So, why did I award four starts instead of five?  The decor of the place could definitely use some work (I suppose you could call it \"minimalist\"), but this is only a minor detail.  I should also add that the portions are very reasonable.  As well, the pork bone soup actually contains a decent amount of PORK, unlike some places that focus more on the bone aspect.  In summary, if you want good, cheap, generously-portioned food, check this place out."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Yonge Street that's worth the price. Yeah service may not be the best, but that's kind of a given when you go to any Asian establishment.  Get the special, it's good."}
{"text":"Service is unacceptable. It was only 8:30 on a Friday night and we wanted BBQ, but they said they ran out already, completely unacceptable for a BBQ restaurant. We wanted the pot lit, but they refused to serve the dish, for no legitimate reason. It's surprising they still last in a core Toronto neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have to confess, the only time I think to go to Yummy BBQ is when I want to go to Bulgogi Bob but they are closed on weekends and evenings, and I need a fix of Spicy Bulgogi Beef and stif fried veggies on rice - then I realize Yummy BBQ sells it too, maybe not quite as good as Bob's but tasty all the same.  When ordering takeout by phone today I described what I wanted and was asked if I wanted a number 8... And told that the lunch special was over at 3.    I said dinner price was fine and a very bored woman kept saying did I want #8??!!!  So I said yes, hoping for the best, and it turned out to be what I wanted.  Yummy BBQ you will always be my backup Bulgogi, but I will from now on just order by number - 8."}
{"text":"To be fair the food is decent as I often come by here for takeout since near my workplace. Im rating this place one star today because this is probably one of the worst services i have even experienced at a restaurant . We came on a saturday and had to wait over an hour for our food with barely an apology or any updates. We had to ask for an update 40 mins in and the lady said it would take another 20 mins and we couldn't  cancel our orders.  When the food finally came we asked if we could at least refill 2 out of the 5 appetizers given and they said they had to be charged extra.     People were getting meals before us, takeouts were being made, they could have offered us a pop or soup as a gesture for our hour long wait but instead they refused to let us cancel our order and wanted to charge us for some extra appetizers. Also to note that we only had 3 people and as much as we wanted to walk out after the update, but we were starving and didn't  want to be confrontational at the moment.   Its not the servers fault, they clearly felt bad but the boss or manager who was actively standing at cash made the decision to do not compensate.  Don't  think  I'll  come back here again."}
{"text":"Wow, my friend took me straight to this place and I have to thank him again for making such a good choice. Very cheap lunch menus with very good food. Very customizable too. We ate like kings and it cost less than McDonalds. I will definately be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Definitely not five star.   I went to this place expecting a mediocre place. It was worse. The table was dirty. The smell, unpleasant. Food apparently is great but I just could not concentrate. I am not sure if this got the best spare rib - my taste bud was disarmed. I cannot eat in a place that smells like under arms.   The whole place needs Febreze.   Prices are cheap and to my dizzying knowledge, was not bad. I ordered fish cutlet and costed me under $ 7. This is a place to go if you want cheap food for under $ 10, but be prepared to ignore the under arm smell.   There is another Yummy on Yonge Street which is slightly better than this location. I would recommend to take a hike from here, and go Yonge Street. Burn off the fat that you're about to consume. Most of the items here are greasy and deep fried.   If you insist on staying here, bring wipes. Lots of it."}
{"text":"UPDATED.   I'm a regular here. Like I'm here at least 1-2 times a week.The servers should know that by now.   Today I came in with my sister and bf who both got #1 the bbq short ribs. Hers came out OK. and his was burnt to the bone .   We tried sending it back to remake and the server said the kitchen didn't let, and so on. We told them we didn't want it because eating burnt is bad for you . So we told her to just remove it off the bill. (4 mins after its brought to the table) she came back and said the kitchen said NO and that we ate HALF of it so we pay for whatever we ate. There's no way we would eat half of your burnt short ribs in 4 mins or at all.   So then the cook came out and started raising his voice to my bf who insisted we either get a refund or have it  remade. the first time asking they refused to remake it (probably because they usually use the same food If it's ever sent back but in this case ribs can't be remade once it's burnt.) then they agreed to remake it after yelling and shit, and who would want a cook like that to make the food? Probably will spit in it   he said some crap about calling the police when he's the one that is basically saying the customer is wrong and forcing us to eat the very burnt ribs.   Like go ahead you goof. You'd make a fool out of your own business.   There is little to no ventilation in the kitchen so the smoke is always burning your eyes so there's no improvement from the first time I been there   So yeah, my 3 star was just being generous from before. But bad service goes a long way for me, and if you think the customers wrong then you sure are a clever one just for that $11 when clearly we weren't wrong or weren't been rude about it at all. Don't raise your voice so the whole few seats can hear you   call the cops next time idiot- if there is a next time."}
{"text":"Food at this place is just so so...however the customer service is awful!  We came in for lunch one day and stood there for about 15 minutes waiting for a table (mind you there about 5-6 tables that were empty and a few that needed to be cleaned).  There were two waiters working and no one even acknowledged us as we stood there waiting.  It wasn't so much the wait that was annoying, it was the fact that we were completely ignored that made me write this review.    There are many better Korean places to go in TO that have better and more authentic food and better way of treating their customers!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the food is tasty.  That's what this place has going for it. Authentic Korean?  My Halmoni (grammy) would turn in her grave if she ever heard me say that. I try not to eat here often, though my growling tummy often tells me otherwise.  Food has too much MSG, salt, and fat.......wait.........guess that's why I love it.  Usually order one of the stews (Kimchi, or Pork Bone) and BBQ specials, or lunch specials.  And always extra spicy.  Agree with most of the comments about service.  Usually feels like the server is working her first shift...ever.  Though to be fair, it appears that they've hired some better wait staff recently.  Oh, and expect a fun-filled day of pungent kimchi flavored gas following your meal.  Still worth it for me!"}
{"text":"As I mentioned in my previous review, the stir fry chicken lunch special wasn't too good. I decided to venture into this place again to give it another chance. I tried the fried egg with beef dish this time. Extremely salty and kind of gross tasting. It was supposed to be beef but it tasted like mystery meat.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend going with a group and order the PoT LiDs!!   I came here along with three over friends on a Saturday night, it wasn't too busy. We ordered the PoT LiD Bar-BQ, four choices (ribs, beef, chicken and pork). This was super yummy, and it says that it serves for two, but it's much more! It was around $49.  We also ordered the BiBimbap with beef, which is also served on a PoT LiD, also serves for two, but again, it was so much food!!! This was $32.  We also got their side dishes, and soju wine.  For the portion of what we got, we were all super stuffed, and even had to take a large portion to go. For the two portions we got, it would've been perfect for 5-6 people!   Certainly a very yummmmmmy place. I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"This place survives because it's one of the few decent Korean restaurants in downtown core. I frequent this place due to its proximity to where I live. Food-wise, any place in Korean town can easily trump Yummy. Their prices have recently increased, they used to be quite affordable. Well, not so much now. Service, like others have noted, is not their strongest point. They always seem to have only 2 servers juggling a lot of tables. There's an older man behind the cash counter who doesn't seem to have a purpose being there. He doesn't cash out people, he doesn't serve tables = he's super useless. The food here is a hit or miss. I like to stick to a couple of favourites every time I eat here: Yuk Gae Jang and their 2 choices BBQ platter. Other things on the menu, I couldn't care less.  You know what annoys me the most about Yummy? They had the nerve to post \"Tipping Etiquette\" on the front page of their menu (and on the walls) despite their lack of customer service."}
