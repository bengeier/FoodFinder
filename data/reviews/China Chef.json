{"text":"AMAZING food for the price! Food quality is as good as King Wah (Rocky River), but prices are cheap. Seriously, I've eaten Chinese food in LA, Taiwan, Shanghai, Beijing, Chicago, Atlanta, etc, and the food QUALITY ranks in the top 10% of my experiences. I've tried several different dishes, and ALL have been excellent, and they didn't taste the same. The hot & sour soup, however, is out of this world. The gal who takes the orders is friendly. It's entertaining to watch the guys making the food--they really work their asses off because it's busy all the time (probably because the food is so damn good)."}
{"text":"The first order was missing an item. Asked for a replacement and got something that wasn't what was ordered. Rather than admit their error the lady on the phone was very rude and wouldn't fix the order.  We will never do business with them again after the way we were treated on the phone."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about China Chef but if you want really good Chinese food at reasonable  prices this is the place. Service is always fast and they are always very accommodating. Personal favorite is the governors chicken but everyone always enjoys their selection. I can't speak to the delivery aspects because I'm outside their delivery area - but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and fellow food adventurer, Crystal, was out of town and I couldn't find any food that sounded too appealing at the time.  Given that she is not a big fan of Chinese food and I could eat it pretty much any time, I decided to take this opportunity to try out China Chef.  I ordered 5 items to go:  ---  Hot and sour soup - When I get Chinese food, I always order hot and sour soup and base first impressions off this dish.  I was pleasantly surprised by this soup at China Chef.  There was plenty of meat in the soup, and the taste was great without any need to add any soy sauce to keep it from being too bland (as with many Chinese restaurants).  Along with water chestnuts, I was surprised to see peas and carrots in the soup, similar to those you find in many super-generic Chinese restaurants' bright yellow fried rice.  I wish the soup was a touch spicier, but then again, I have a high tolerance for heat and it was nothing a touch of sambal oelek from my refrigerator couldn't solve.  Fried wontons - Some background: I just moved to the Cleveland area from Indianapolis, Indiana, and my favorite Chinese restaurant near my home there has some great fried wontons.  They were cheap and packed full of a delicious pork filling.  Although they are a touch more in price than their counterparts at China Chef, I was hoping for something similar, but I was wrong.  The ratio of filling-to-wrapper at China Chef is way off; it took me 3 pieces before I realized I was eating something other than just the fried wonton dough/wrapper.  Nestled deep in the fried dough, I found a small piece of Chinese barbecued pork, about the size of an average marble.  This being said, the fried wontons were still pretty good for the price, but they definitely need to be eaten with soup or the included sweet and sour sauce.  Governor's pork - I assume this is China Chef's version of General Tso's, only with chicken instead of pork.  I did not recall ever seeing a pork variety of General Tso's on a menu and I am a big fan of pork dishes, so I figured I would give it a try.  When I got home and opened the typical white to-go carton, I was surprised to see the pork was encased in a fluffier batter that is more typical of sweet & sour chicken than General Tso's.  The pork was still very tasty, although a couple of pieces were very, very fatty (and I typically put up with a bit of fat on meat).  Also, there were only a couple pieces of broccoli, even in comparison to the small amount of vegetables that typically come with General Tso's.  Fried rice - As with most Chinese restaurants, steamed rice comes with many dishes, and I opted to sub in fried rice with my Governor's Pork.  I do not recall if this substitution came with additional cost.  In any case, I was pleasantly surprised by the fried rice.  Given the peas and carrot pieces in the hot and sour soup, I was fearing your typical bright yellow fried rice. What I found was surprisingly dark but very tasty.  I was also happy to see that there were plenty of bean sprouts in the rice, but no peas or carrot chunks.  Chicken lo mein - Another surprise here--the lo mein was very light in color compared to the lo mein with which I am familiar.  You typically see lo mein that is caramel in color, but this lo mein was yellow (although not a bright almost-neon color like the generic fried rice of most Chinese restaurants mentioned above).  In addition, it came with pea pods, baby corn, and more bean sprouts.  The chicken was super velvety and not doused in soy sauce.  This was probably my favorite sampling.  ---  Overall, the food was pretty good with quite a few nice surprises in terms of ingredients.  China Chef does not have a lot in terms of ambiance, so this is definitely not a place to take a date.  I believe were 3 booths that could seat 4 each, and one chair under a smaller flat-panel television.  It looked like everyone else was waiting on to-go orders, and each order was served very quickly.  There was a vending machine for soda, and I have a feeling that waitstaff would have came to the table, should I have chosen to eat in.  The woman who took my order was also very friendly, and the food was hot and packaged up quickly.  All in all, I will likely go back to China Chef from time to time, given its proximity to my current apartment (it is currently the closest place to get food, aside from KFC).  I am planning on moving to a different part of the near-Cleveland area once I sell my house back in Indianapolis, and assuming I find another place with decent Chinese food nearby, I don't think I would travel back to Streetsboro just to visit China Chef.  For now though, China Chef is my choice for good Chinese food in the Streetsboro area."}
{"text":"Their brocolli and garlic sauce is so very oily. Very good, but definitely not the healthiest option."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Quick delivery and wide variety on the menu. I got the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls and crab Rangoon. Would order again."}
{"text":"If i could give negative stars i would...Most disgusting place I have ever been to... Not only did I have to wait an extra 15 min past their quoted pick up time my food was cold and had hair in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!.... I will never go to this joke of a Chinese place again"}
{"text":"Ordered tonight and all of it was great! The sauces are flavorful without being too heavy or greasy. Vegetables are tender crisp and the proteins are never rubbery or overcooked. Love China Chef. We've been ordering from them for years and the food has gotten even better in that time!"}
{"text":"yum yum yum!  best egg rolls in town and fast delivery"}
{"text":"I would like to rate this 2.5 out of 5 stars and here is why... My boyfriend and I ordered General Tso's chicken, Singapore chow mei fun, won ton soup, and the special house lo mein. Some of the flavors were there- but the meat quality is atrocious!!!! The \"pork\" was a big culprit- I don't know what they think they used in the won tons, but it definitely was not pork (after trying it, the rest was thrown away). The chicken was very sub par also. I can find a better quality meat at a fast food restaurant. I sincerely hope, even if it means raising the prices, China Chef increases their quality of meat!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy getting take out from china chef but the last time I had it, I found a large caterpillar in my meal. Right on top in the rice. I was absolutely disgusted. Threw out the whole thing and everything I got, talk about a waste of money. Will never go back. The place doesn't seem very clean anyways so I should have expected to find bugs in my food sooner haha"}
{"text":"I got take once and that would that last time I made that mistake. After 45 minutes of waiting for a wanton soup and general Chen's chicken I called to check the status on my order and they said they had just started making it. So after waiting all of an hour and a half, I can honestly say I've had better and will not be back.  For that I give one star"}
{"text":"I'm torn because I like the food, but every time I order delivery from here, the wait gets longer and longer. This past time it has been an hour and a half wait - and I live 5 minutes away, if that. Their excuse? They opened late - okay if you open late, you should call your customers that made an online order at the time you were SUPPOSED to open amd explain to them what happened.  When I call to ask if they have gotten my order, they apologize and say it is on its way, but I can tell they seem confused about the order and then I still have to wait another twenty minutes. Inevitabley, if this happens, there is always something missing. Needless to say, the next time I want to order Chinese delivery, it won't be from here. When I call in for carry out and pick it up on the way home from work, it's usually ready within ten minutes.  So I'm confused as to why it takes an extra hour and twenty minutes to have it delivered..."}
{"text":"Very quick delivery! Food is always good and hot when delivered..... I get the beef and broccoli and sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"I was going to give only two stars but some of my opinion might be a culture difference since I'm from Texas. I didn't think there would be a big difference in Chinese food from the north to the south, but there is.  I ordered delivery, the man on the phone and the guy that dropped the food off were both nice and polite and my delivery was quick.  The sauce on my beef and broccoli was really different, no sweetness to it at all and kind of a teriyaki taste. There were a lot more other vegetables than broccoli.  The fried rice was okay, you definitely don't need to add any soy sauce to it though. And I've never seen fried rice with sprouts in it.  I also ordered an egg roll and crab ragoon which was fine except I didn't have any sweet and sour sauce for either of them.  So for me the meal was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"My family and I used to go here all the time and it was great. Well we stopped going and not I remember why. We just got food from there a few days ago and ordered a quart of sweet and sour chicken. The chicken was VERY small and mushy. I get that sometimes the food can get mushy instead of big, fluffy, and a little crunch. I don't plan on coming here again."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and wanted to try the local Chinese place.  I ordered the beef and vegetable and pork lo mein dishes and the meat smelled and tasted like it was spoiled, especially the beef. The noodles had very little flavor and the vegetables absorbed a lot of the spoiled beef flavor.  It was unfortunately inedible.  The egg rolls were very big and were much better than the food. Also, we placed the order around 730 PM and it took ~45 min for the food to arrive, which is much longer than typical Chinese food delivery takes in my experience, especially since I live less than 3 miles away.  Based on some of the high reviews, I'm hoping it was an off day for them. But I personally will not order from here in the future."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time a month ago and I was pretty impressed with the food.  The servings are ginormous and the food is super hot.  I had sweet and sour chicken so it really wasn't that exciting but my husband seemed to enjoy his dish.  I loved the eggroll.  We need to stop forgetting about this gem!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had delivery from China Chef. There's not many options for delivery food in Streetsboro, either this Chinese or Pizza. The food is ok, it won't blow you away or anything. The dishes are a little on the \"slimey\" side. I'd give them a 2.5 if I could. And there is not many delivery options I'll be using them again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Lorain county. Crab ragoon is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Out of the three of us only one person didn't like their entree. I got: shredded beef combo extra spicy. Good but some meat was over cooked. The spicy was there though. The egg roll was soo good.  My friends got fried wontons and crab Rangoon, big hit very yummy.  Their entrees were Coconut chicken (he love it) and Beef and broccoli (he said the sauce was too bland, kinda not that interesting of a dish to start with lol.).   Overall I would repeat."}
{"text":"Ordered food as a group of 6 for work. All items came as expected. Food was hot although chicken chow mein needed a tad more sauce since they mixed the rice in ot as well sucking up any extra sauce. It was given two stars based on the fact that I found a piece of metal mixed in my food, pic included."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent delivery service. Pricing is very reasonable and the portions are big. Would highly recommend this place.  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"The person answering the phone is definitely not someone built to take calls. She needs to just stay behind the scenes and not interact with anyone! As far as the food, it is just ok. It is sub par and just lie any other sub par Chinese restaurant. I had the general tso chicken and asked for it to be spicy. It was everything but spicy. It lacked sauce and there was hardly any chicken. It is pure breading. The rice is bland. The egg roll was hard. The Lo mein was cold. Everything lacked flavor and seasoning. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. I would take business elsewhere and enjoy better tasting food with better customer service and attitudes. Next!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day and got chicken and shrimp Lo Mein... It tasted like water , the chicken and shrimp had absolutely no flavor at all. It was ready in 3 minutes after I ordered it so in most cases fast is good , in this case 3 minutes equated to horrible food / service. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is better than most delivery chinese restaurants around the area.  It's not as greasy and everyone seems really nice."}
{"text":"Got freaking food poisoning so naturally you can guess my review and the rating reason...  Ordered General Tso's and the fact that it tasted like it was 3 days old should have tipped me off but Chinese is my passion.   $7.20 for a combination platter just like ANY other Chinese spot in the history of ever.   Customer service was good, the lady on the phone was so nice and helpful, I wish I didn't get poisoning from here because the service would have brought me back.   Le sigh...."}
{"text":"I like China Chef quite a bit. The value is remarkable. Very cheap prices. Service is strong. Most important, the sesame chicken is just like I remembered as a kid - served with a strong and sweet sauce unlike other places I've tried that weaken the sauce. The crab Rangoon is also delightful. Always a good dish, China Chef still seems to make it better. It's perfectly crisp, the cream cheese comes oozing out, so delicious, so hot. Would give the Rangoon an A, the Sesame chicken a B+ and the value an A-."}
{"text":"Really good food, at great prices. The boyfriend and I each had a vegetable egg roll, hands down the best egg roll I've had in a long long while. Filled with cabbage,  mushrooms, carrots, perfect crispiness-it was such a nice change of pace from the usual vegetarian egg rolls, which tend to mean cabbage shredded and stuffed into a maybe crisp wrapper, dripping with vegetable oil.  We shared the governor's tofu and the Kung Bao vegetables.  The governor's tofu was really great, I thought the sauce was amazing,  it had a nice sweet heat to it. The tofu was a bit soft for me, but that really is a preference thing and I didn't ask them to make it extra crispy.  The Kung Bao was good, but the vegetables were a bit too largely chopped and the mushrooms looked like they had been frozen. But the sauce was really good. Both portions were amazingly huge for the price.  we will definitely be heading back, they may become our favorite Chinese place if they keep pouring on the sauce!"}
{"text":"Foods pretty good. The price is a little more than comparable places but it's still worth it."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is really good.  Beef Broccoli especially.  Pricing is pretty good and really tastes awesome.  Have ordered from here about 10 times and always satisfied.  Sometimes they forget something on your order, but generally not. There's pretty much nowhere to sit in the place and eat, definitely want to do take-out.  If you live in the Parma area, there isn't another chinese place for several miles that can touch this place in terms of flavor and deliciousness.  Ever since New Dragon on Pearl shut down, we had been trying new places until we found this one."}
{"text":"Very generous portions for a low price, and always very fast with delivery. I've had better Chinese, but it's still pretty good and they have great service!"}
{"text":"Food is ok at best, but the service, person taking the order, is rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I am from the area and used to go to China Chef often. I decided to order takeout this evening for my family. I called and was immediately surprised by how rude the person answering the phone was. After trying to place my order the employee let out an exasperated sigh and said \"oh my gosh\". I was absolutely insulted. I have placed this order many times before. I quickly cancelled my order and hung up. Terrible customer service. They have lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"Your typical substandard Chinese takeout. (There are so many of these places, unfortunately.) Lots of canned veggies, chewy meat, and deep fried options that have obviously been prepared in old oil. The woman who answers the phone is particularly unpleasant and unfriendly, as icing on the cake. The only truly good menu item we've had here are the dumplings; they are better than many."}
{"text":"The first time we had it, the food was great, cheap, hot, and fresh...subsequent trips...still cheap...not as great...but fine..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Was sad when I moved from Lakewood...had a fave Chinese place near W117th. Moved to West Park and tried China chef. I literally order from this okace every weekend I feel! It's so good every time! The crab Rangoons are amazing. The Singapore Mei fun is delicious! The sugar donuts... Wow.my boyfriend and I can't get enough. They're always friendly, quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"Rude person taking orders. The food was the poorest example of Chinese food. Egg rolls old and hard outside, undercooked inside. Soup tasted like no other soup we had and not in a good way. Terrible and never again"}
{"text":"Great food all around. They'll make special orders and accommodate special requests. Their lo mein is on point! It's always only 10-15 minutes! I recommend trying the crab Rangoon if you've never had them."}
{"text":"Love their food. So much flavor...plus delivery. Can't beat it. My favorite chinese in the area. Try singapore mei fun and the hunan shrimp"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery, General T'so was great. The sweet and sour soup is soo good. We really enjoyed it. Dumplings were big and good... egg rolls good to!!"}
{"text":"Holy big egg rolls batman.  Very good!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how rude the woman that answered the phone was this evening.  I have never been spoken to in that manner by someone in customer service.  She actually yelled at me over the phone!  She truly is offensive and not a pleasant person, I will be taking my business elsewhere.  It is a shame because I do enjoy the food and ordered a few times a month.  I promise I will never order from this place again.  You could not pay me enough to tolerate such a bitchy person just to eat some General Tso chicken!  1 star is too much!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area.  Not impressed. Beef was chewy. Rice and egg roll had little flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Under 30min. Food arrived piping hot and smelled amazing. All individually packaged. I was impressed that the sweet and sour sauce was in a separate container than the chicken. This way it wasn't soggy! And the breaking maintained its crunch. Very generous with condiments. Pepper beef w onions was so so so well seasoned. Great overall. Great deal for prices. Friendly delivery guy. Will order again."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to get sick.  I used to go there a lot, but my son got  take out from there and got the pukerinos.  I figured it was just one of those things, but I got sick also. Quit going for a while, but I decided to give them another chance, and went in there one afternoon planning to order. One of the workers was playing with the children on the floor, and another worker brought out a tray of shrimp.  They proceeded to shell the shrimp without washing their hands. Not exactly due diligence when it comes to the health factor, is it? Conclusion: avoid like the plague. If you find yourself in the neighborhood, run, don't walk, past China Chef!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice...food was horrible...almond chicken was not even breaded...no gravy...no taste at all....the almonds tasted rancid...the wonton soup was just noodles and broth...the fried rice was terrible and the only thing good was the white rice and vegetables. I ordered the egg roll, but it tasted like a spring roll. My granddaughter's sweet and sour chicken had a decent taste. I guess I am spoiled...when you've had the best, nothing else will do. Thanks for allowing me to voice my view."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite to order from.  The last two times I ordered green pepper steak, the meat was either fatty or hard to chew.  Something has really changed for the worse at this place.  I will no longer go here anymore.  Another meal in the garbage."}
{"text":"This is my goto Chinese food place since moving to northeast Ohio. They make things exactly how I ask and how I like it. They make it quick and they make it right. Favorites are the house lo mein and the crab rangoon."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to Streetsboro a few months ago and were looking for a Chinese food place. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. If you think this is Chinese food, you've never had good Chinese food. The chicken and broccoli was pretty much bland slimey vegetables. No flavoring. Very unimpressed and will not be returning, which is unfortunate because the service was great. A waste of $22."}
{"text":"We just moved to town and thought they had closed since the gps took us to a random place across the highway.  That's not the restaurants fault, especially since we should have noticed the big sign that we drive by daily! Our bad.  There are plenty of options and the portions are generous.  It's fresh and piping hot even if you take it to go.  Next time we will order ahead and pick up or have delivery since it can take awhile on a weekend.  We will go again, our family loved this place."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. ..your average run of the mill chinese. Do most get their food from the same place? Was told 15 min for delivery & ended up being 45...which I could've handled better if the food was above standard."}
{"text":"I found this place while looking for a Chinese takeaway. They are like any other Chinese takeaway near my office or elsewhere. Their lomeins are good. I like their curry chicken in particular. Overall, a pretty decent and generic place for Chinese food.  They sell super cute and pretty chopsticks too.  Updated 6/3/2018: I ordered schechuan shrimp which had the little chili symbol next to its name but the dish tasted extremely sweet. I don't know how that qualifies as \"Hot\". Even the hot and sour soup was a little sweet."}
{"text":"I have ordered carryout from here numerous times and have never been disappointed.(they deliver) The people who answer the phone are always friendly and very helpful as I explain what I want every time and never know the name of my entree. The chicken noodle soup isn't the greatest, but the crab ragoons here are a must have every time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the epitome of mediocre. Nothing stood out. There was nothing inherently negative about my experience. The service was average. I ordered vegetable lo mein and wonton soup. It was fresh but very bland, no spices or soy sauce. It was just a very unmemorable, mediocre experience, which to be honest is the worst thing you can be. I would rate 2.5 stars an extra half a point, due to it being very very fresh."}
{"text":"Use to be the best around. Lately disappointing. Over cooked food. Smaller egg rolls. Going to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love China chef, price is right and they give you a ton of food ..and it's good!!! .for the people who wrote the negative  comments...if you can't say anything nice how about you practice  saying nothing at all..."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good. Now no matter what you order it seems really oily. The pork egg rolls seriously have no pork in them lol..... we order here a lot and the egg rolls have been like this every time, so it's not like it was a mistake just once. And the girl answering the phone is pretty mean. And when you pick up your food, she isn't much better. We're giving you our business, so why are you so rude??"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around also their delivery is very quick and they are super nice"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood Chinese restaurant around. I've been coming here over 15 years. The food is consistent, always hot & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordered almost $40 bucks worth with tip....35 minutes later cold food.   I usually think 35 minutes is generally a good delivery time anywhere else, but Chinese 1/4 mile from my house... Not good.  One of five dishes were hot... So that tells me everything else just sat around.  Regretfully I must stop ordering Chinese in Parma heights, it seems east china on broadview in good ol' regular parma is the only place worth dealing with (if you can see past the terrible attitude they have).   I am so sick of writing bad reviews for terrible Chinese takeout. Is there anywhere worth ordering from around here?"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant menu. Nothing terrible but nothing spectacular. My sons prefer this to be our neighborhood go to Chinese restaurant. My way of tellin a good chinese restaurant is how thirsty I am after eating there. Barely thirsty! So I'll take it! I enjoy their crab ragoon, veggie lo mein and ham fried rice."}
{"text":"Well, it looks like China Chef took ownership of this Yelp page and listened to its customers because the lady who works the counter and answers the phone is now more friendly and respectful both on the phone and in person!  The added personality and kindness was much needed. (See Grant W's and James B's review and my tip)  Food is still very consistent and inexpensive too and they do make the best hot and sour soup around! My mother even said it was very good when I brought takeout over for my parents tonight. :)"}
