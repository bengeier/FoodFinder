{"text":"I got the turkey sandwich.  Slightly small sandwich but the side dish added value and it was delicious! Nice clean, contemporary decor & good service.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with my experience last night at Bloom. The food was fresh and yummy, the restaurant was immaculate and the service was excellent. The employee who helped us was polite, kind and aiming to please. I wish I had gotten his name, but he was the only one working on Saturday night. This bakery bakes deliciousness and has a wonderful mission."}
{"text":"love this place. drip coffee isn't so great, but won't go anywhere else for my croissant and espresso :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful staff, good coffee, and the most exquisite strawberry cheese pastry! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great people. I enjoyed my visit downtown; as for the campus location my experience was not great but not awful. I had the tuna salad and a baguette as a side. My friend tried the curry chicken salad? (Sorry I cannot recall the name) with baguette as well. The bread was very hard to break apart and eat, but it was manageable with a lot of hard work and effort! The food was decent if you are looking for a quick meal. Overall, I'm glad that they moved closer to campus. (: can't wait to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"Never been here before so I decided to try it between my classes. They were very helpful when I entered the store when I stated I have never been there before and they promptly brought me a menu. After deciding on the tuna salad sandwich and potatoe salad I decided to add a coffee as well. The total was around $10, which is normal for a cafe this type.  She gave me my coffee and told me sugar and cream was down at the other end. It seemed to take a long time to make a simple sandwich. I got my order to go and when I got to my location to eat I discovered they gave me the wrong sandwich, it was a turkey which was still good but not what I ordered.  Over all the food was good but not somewhere I would be eager to go to again."}
{"text":"Great selection of bakery items - any kind of donut you could want! Amazing freshly baked bread. A nice soar to work or eat in and a window to watch them make the bakery so you can have a Willy Wonka moment! The service was exceptional and it is for such a great cause. Social good rock on! Go eat some pastries!"}
{"text":"Walked there because Yelp says it closes at 9pm. Was closed when we got there. Storefront says 6pm."}
{"text":"I've pretty much only ever stepped in to get their coffee and maybe a pastry of two. They knew what they were doing when they opened this place up across the street from Cleveland State.  I've had their caramel machiatto or the equivalent of it and I wasn't the biggest fan. I like my coffee sweet but this went bit above and beyond. Their lattes are perfectly lovely thoough.  This time around I grabbed a asiago bun...thing? The name is not important, what is important is the fact that it was beyond delicious and it was $0.99. My friend got their almond croissant and it was great at the first bite, then she found out it had a filling and it just got better.  Overall this place seems lovely and I'd love to see what else they have. Apparently they'll soon be selling donuts made in-house!"}
{"text":"YaY! At this cold weather, you can find me at the a Bloom Bakery! First, they always have home- made, healthy, and hot soups-love it! Next, they offer combos such as soup+salad, and I often go for it (I like beer salad). Service and food are wonderful- so far, I haven't been disappointed with anything. The waiters are always smiley and helpful. Also, you can come here to work on you computer- the place is spacious and comfy.  I would give this place 4.5. The minus is that sometimes I would like to see variety on the menu and maybe more healthy stuff from the bakery (I mean some vegan or flourless items). Anyway, I like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"They butter the bread in your sandwiches you guys! That may not sound so exciting, but it made my day! Its so refreshing to have a sandwich prepared in a way that you are not used to (same-o-mayo).  I chose the pork loin and apple chutney sandwich on their artisan white bread and it definitely hit the spot.  The chutney had a nice kick and it complimented the savory and tender sliced pork loin. All sandwiches are served with a side. I chose the potato salad and I was glad it wasn't swimming in dressing. It was herby with the perfect amount of pickle. For $7.95, I was very pleased"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never had something at Bloom that I didn't like. I've tried their bakery items and sandwiches and soups and all are so delicious. My favorite sandwich is the smoked salmon (it comes with butter and egg salad type spread!) on a baguette, but I'm also a fan of the Catalan Chicken. The beet salad and potato salad sides are also great.   As far as desserts, the almond croissant is so buttery and pulls apart perfectly. Their chocolate chip cookie is also great - it's big enough to share (but you don't have to!) and so soft and chewy.   I find it hard to leave without getting something to-go as well and their house white bread is a staple in our household now. It's crusty and has a slightly sourdough like taste.  The staff are also great. Caitlin (sp?) is always helpful and friendly and I genuinely enjoy stopping by the cafe!"}
{"text":"So happy to have Bloom Bakery's second location open now in the Campus District. Their pastries are amazing and breads are delicious.  Have used their catering services for lunch meetings and they are top notch and reasonably priced.  On top of all of that - this is a social enterprise of Towards Employment, to help people with barriers to hiring gain skills and have successful careers."}
{"text":"This place has such friendly staff. The beet salad was fantastic! T also had an Oat cranberry cookie that was out of this world. Loved it and will return if I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Delicious java. I had a vanilla latte which had a pleasant nutty roast, lightly sweetened. Loved it :) Service was genuinely warm and friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Bloom at Public Square before, but not this location.   I tried the Pastrami with a side of the house potato salad this visit. The pepper cured pastrami sandwich came with Swiss cheese. I opted for the suggested rye bread, but they were out of it so I got wheat. The sandwich was very good and a thick serving of Pastrami was provided. The Pastrami was not as spicy as I was expecting, but it certainly can appeal to more palates that way.   The potato salad I really enjoyed. The potato pieces are kept large and the dressing was not overwhelming in quantity. The potatoes were cooked skin on and to an al dente quality which kept them from getting mushy in the dressing.    I'll also mention that I recently used Bloom for a small dessert catering order and they nicely presented 3 dozen cookies. The Cranberry and Oat Cookie being one of the most wonderful cookies I have had in awhile."}
{"text":"The granola bar is perfection. It's not too sweet, there's a balancing tinge of salt, and its texture forces me to chew and about each chomp. Its density is not too chewy and definitely not hard. The bits are well mixed and chopped fine so nothing sticks to my teeth and only a few sesame seeds stuck around between, which I don't mind at all. I want more!"}
{"text":"Having previously visited Bloom at Public Square, I have been wanting to stop by this location and finally did so today. It is conveniently located right across the street from Cleveland State.   As soon as we came in, Evan warmly greeted us. I ordered the Catalan chicken sandwich with seeded bread and a side of beet salad. They were both healthy and tasty choices, although I found the chicken a little plain. Next, I tried the house potato salad which was so good that I am craving some at this very moment. Due to a promotion they were having, I was able to receive a free cup of coffee as well which was a bonus.   Needless to say, I was a satisfied customer."}
