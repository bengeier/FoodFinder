{"text":"To be honest, I was hesitating between 2 and 3 stars. The food is ok. Just like any other Russian restaurant where food is plenty, Tatiana restaurant has nice plates of everything to start with and food keeps coming throughout the dinner like there is no tomorrow. It flows between 7PM and 1:30AM next day, so you can imagine how much food is served. It comes with its price, though ($70+ to be precise) However, for that amount of food this is negligible. The music is typical Russian-Ukranian mix. I believe for some $20 you may order Russian song of your choice. However, the music is loud. How loud? Well, you won't be able to speak with person sitting next to you, unless you yell at the top of your lungs. Again, similar to other Russian restaurants, the alcohol is flowing in. Most people bring its own due to price. Russians do not consume alcohol in glasses, but count in bottles and containers (I suspected some guests would be dragged out by the end of the party when carton after carton of vodka was entering the hall for neighbouring party. Why I said in the beginning I rate between 2 and 3 which does not seem fair based on the review? I guess it all depends on the expectations from the restaurant. I value a little food and a lot of conversations. If you like enormous amount of food, extra loud music and few drunk guests along the way as part of the typical Russian culture, then the restaurant is for you. Few more points to notice. The entrance's checking room charges $2 per coat, which is ridiculous given the food price (and it's not a theatre) Most guests were using chairs for the coats even though we were told coats are not allowed in the main hall. Also, the owner of the restaurant bearing her name is ... sharp person. Not exactly comely and homey, but sharp commanding style general, knowing its business."}
{"text":"I have celebrated my 30th birthday at Tatiana's over the weekend.   First of all the food is just fantastic! The service was excellent and I had an amazing time overall.  I would say it's one of the top Russian restaurant out there.  P.s. This review was supposed to be posted in March 2014 but got stuck in my draft folder instead."}
{"text":"Whoever that other person that gave this amazing place a 3 star clearly a) doesn't have enough experience with Russian restaurants and b) doesn't understand how to properly approach a \"sharp\" owner named Tatiana (duh) who is the sweetest and the most helpful person. I hope people don't take this seriously as he has just one review. Speaks volumes about his Russian restaurant experiences...  Just FYI I have been to over 15 different Russian Restaurants, including 2 more in Los Angeles. Let's do this review right and give an amazing place justice.   THIS IS THE RUSSIAN RESTAURANT RIGHT NOW. THE PLACE. ASK ANY SINGLE EASTERN EUROPEAN BAKERY IN NORTH YORK/TORONTO and they will tell you wow, everyone is going to Tatiana. We had to reserve our Saturday night 3 months in advance. People from Hamilton, St Cathrines, Pickering, Ajax, Mississauga -everyone is trying to get into this restaurant. Why? You need to understand the nature of RR (let's just go with this for Russian Restaurant(s) from now on). It's an extremely difficult and restless business - you need to be working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. RR management and names and chefs change weekly if not every other 4 days. So, if you go to one RR and you LOVE it and go back the next week you may not find that you have the same food or the same service.  Russian people drink and they dance. This is what RR is about. Don't come here with expectations of a friggin steak house on King St, what is wrong with you? It's an EVENT. It's a BANQUET HALL. People come here to wear their beautiful suits and dresses, to meet with their best friends, to drink and to eat amazing food. I've had bad food experiences with RRs but this one is great I have no complaints about the food AT ALL. (except for the holodets, anyone who's Russian will know and will understand that no one ever likes or eats it at RRs...)   So. About the service. Have you ever seen Orange is the New Black? Tatiana is Red. She's not rude. She is not mean. She is extremely helpful, she is nice, she is stressed out but she is organized to the tits and she will get sh*t done and FAST. If she tells you how many people don't go hmmm...welll....i was thinking... NO. NO! TELL HER HOW MANY GODDAMN PEOPLE AND MOVE ON. If she tell you come at 8 do not come at 7. She will say what the F are you doing here. Because this is business and ain't nobody got time for your indecisiveness.   Tatiana also has one of the best RR websites out there - with a full menu available online.   Booze: bring your own. to the other reviewer person - are you friggin kidding me? Where else can you get a 2L bottle of wine for $12 bucks (LCBO) and a 7 course dinner with caviar, seafood, lamb, traditional Georgian food (that's hella hard to make), huge marinated oyster mushrooms, kebabs, etc for $65+10% tip and tax. HELLO. WHAT PLANET DO YOU LIVE ON. Also, $65+tip is the weekend night price. Weekday nights and brunch are much cheaper and much quieter with no sacrifice in quality.   Food: i posted some legit pictures. White fish fillet stuffed with crab and baked with cheese, smoked salmon, marinated mushrooms, grilled pepers artichokes zucchini and asparagus, roasted potatoes, pate, 5+ different kinds of salads, cold cuts including chicken with apricot INSIDE (yeah.). stuffed eggplants, prosciutto with melon, chicken salads, red caviar, rice, chicken lamb and minced meat kebabs, mussels and shrimp sauteed in some kind of cheese tomato sauce, i could go on for days. you get the point, there is something for EVERYONNEEE and it's impossible to list everything I ate there.  Service: Fast, attentive, cute and funny. We even gave our servers one of my mom's 50th birthday bouquets because she was sooo cute.  Entertainment: Saxophone dude - you're so cute and your voice is like an Angel's. Also, those sax skills...wooow. The girl, i wish i knew your name, thank you for singing that Ukrainian song in support of our motherland. GO HOME PUTIN.   Decor: Lovely. The table pieces were tasteful and charming, I love the table set up and there was plenty of room.  TIP #1: Bring your own wine. There's no corking fee.  TIP #2: Ask them to pack up whatever is left over! They have boxes, it's allowed and you can eat delicious resto food for a whole week!  TIP #3: Dance. Enjoy yourself. You're coming into a different culture's home - embrace it and enjoy it, try new things.   I LOVE YOU TATIANA!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was embarrassingly bad. The servers were warm and friendly but the owner was a bitter pill. They sat us quite awkwardly near the bar  literally my back was against the bar. The owner rushed us through the meal and was generally unpleasant. She limited what we could take home as leftovers, not allowing two,e of the dishes with mayo in them and any of the pickles. I strongly suspect that they put the pickles etc. back with the stock in the kitchen. Which really grossed me out. I would not recommend this place unless you are in a large group and part of the Russian community.  The staff were otherwise lovely and they food was tasty. Just the owner was weird, suspicious behaviour around the food and rude to myself and my friend."}
