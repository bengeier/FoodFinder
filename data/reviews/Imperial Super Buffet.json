{"text":"I'd been here for lunch twice recently for lunch--$4.99.  Food is very well prepared without exception.  For example they had a spicy hot and sour egg drop soup with tofu and loads of fresh mushrooms.  Very very good. They also cook a pork roast that is tender and delicious. There baked crab and cheese casserole was cooked perfectly. I'm sure the big chunks of crab were artificial -- but a high quality product.  Service was good.  Staff  was genuinely friendly --not like in many oriental buffets. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"While the concept is not strange to me (I mean I like the idea of a buffet-style meal on some occasions...usually to proceed a night before of too much fun), this place doesn't do anything well.   Pros:  -It's open in the sense of space. You aren't on top of one another -the food generally gets replenished in a decent manner  Cons:  -Wait staff are all non-english-speaking. While getting a drink for you isn't rocket science, they make you feel like it just might be. -Hovering. They REALLY want your dirty plates. REALLY bad. Even if they're empty. I can only imagine they're being beaten if the gal in charge sees some slacking..... -the gal in charge dresses like a prostitute from a cheesy 80's comedy. She is also extremely thin. I have various nicknames for this one that all involve a reference to Skeletor.   The food isn't amazing. Should it be expected to be? It's next to a Walmart in/around Eastlake...so with that, you get something as well.    If you are just hungry AF and don't care at all, go. It will scratch that itch."}
{"text":"I truly have no idea were to start, but lets begin with if their kitchen is remotely in the shape as the restroom or dinning area how do they stay open , the food is absolutely disgusting oh wait everything about this visit was disgusting never ever again ! Just hope we dont all get sick"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and we ate here 4 months ago. This restaurant is under New Ownership.  The food is better than it was in June. The Crab rangoon's are my favorite. We were pleasantly surprised to find Loquat fruit near the banana pudding food bar. It is our favorite Asian fruit.  The food was hot.  My guy said the Beef that you carve yourself was good.  I really like the Egg Fu Yung sauce and I put in on the Vegetables and rice.  Unfortunately there were not any Wontons in the soup so I put Pot Stickers in the soup and it was almost the same.  We didn't see the Hostess who dresses strange there and hopefully she doesn't work there anymore.  The Waitstaff doesn't speak much English and hopefully they will hire people who speak some English."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese buffet. Good food at a very reasonable price. Lunch buffet is the same price every day of the week."}
{"text":"Mmmm good yeah the hostess wears a micro mini skirt but who cares good food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Above average Chinese buffet.  Food is generally hot and tasty.  Selection is more limited than most, though."}
{"text":"I got chastised by my family for saying this place was 5 stars. I just thought it was such a good deal for lunch - $4.99. But they are right. The stars are right where they should be at 3.5. I'll give it a 4 cause it is so cheap like you wouldn't expect it to also be grand but it is def not 5 stars. Carry on!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times it's pretty far away unless I'm out that way I don't go. Huge amounts of different foods to choose from. Seafood chicken sushi. If your out this way it's 5 stars in quality and price."}
