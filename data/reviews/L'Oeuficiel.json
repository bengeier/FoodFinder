{"text":"Quel accueil! Équipe souriante et accueillante. Service rapide, assiettes toujours chaudes. Magnifique place de cartier, différente ambiance des grandes chaînes, plus personnel. Choix similaires aux autres restaurants déjeuner mais avec une différente twist si vous avez envie d'être plus aventureux. Essayer le chili en choix de viande!!! Délicieux !!!"}
{"text":"I liked my experience at L'Oeuficiel, even though its name is yet another cringe worthy pun off the word egg.   Anyways I came here with low eggspections but I was really suprised on how well everything turned out. We were promptly seated and I went with their Swiss cheese and ham Egg Benedict. The side was some fried potatoes and a bowl of fresh fruits. No bread, unlimited filter coffee for about $13.  The Egg Benedict was good but not the best I've had. I felt the English muffin too hard for my taste. Also having some bread with this meal would help clear up the yolk mess the meal left behind! Yum yum. The fried potatoes were just ok. The bowl of fruits was very fresh and good.  Our waitress Isabelle was eggcellent, taking care of a dozen tables and the wait time was close to non-existent. She was very friendly, helpful and made me feel welcome. Service was exceptional.  All in all, a solid breakfast joint. I'll be back to check out their other options for sure."}
{"text":"It's good nothing bad to say eating going out for breakfast always cost alot but every now and than its worth it.  Realy good service coffee for me not so great price what you expect took eggs bacon with sausage"}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are more for a child. This plates does not do justice to a full grown man. I love it when a restaurant shows abundance with an array of fruit mix on the plate and not just 2 tiny slices of fruit and 2 small pieces of susage for premium price for breakfast plate."}
{"text":"Just finished eating my breakfast at L'Oeuficiel and it's not that different from any other breakfast chains but I can't say it's bad. Nice decor, very warm and cozy look. The food is very average like 99% of breakfast places. They have good friendly staff. If your not in the mood for Tims or Cora give this it a try."}
