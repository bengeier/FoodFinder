{"text":"I'm half way through dinner and already this is some of the best and beautiful sushi in Montréal."}
{"text":"Terrific sushi with excellent presentation. The outside terrace is really fantastic. Well worth checking it out. We'll certainly be heading back!"}
{"text":"There are many places to get sushi where ever you are. There is \"sushi\" and then there is \"ah-mazing sushi\". Mizu falls under the category of \"ah-mazing\"!  We can easily be critical of sushi on so many levels. It starts with the texture of the food; how fresh the ingredients are and equally important - the presentation.  We were invited to go there by very dear friends whom we hadn't seen in a while. Their palate is discerning enough for us to definitely trust them and we were not disappointed.  Tina, the owner, came to greet us and say hello to our friends, when we arrived. My friend asked her to prepare dishes for us, which she thought we would enjoy. What struck us was the visual appeal as we \"taste\" first with our eyes and then the other senses take over. Our first dish was a \"piéce-monté\" of sushi on a pedestal plate, with incredible seared Ahi tuna which could not be more perfect. We knew instantly that Tina and her team, take this art very seriously. The other  varieties of sushis and salads which accompanied the evening were simply, one delight after another.  Do not expect to find your sushi and sashimi to be camouflaged by an abundance of wasabi and other sauces here - a practice held by many \"assembly-line\" sushi places. Instead, expect the dishes to be prepared with such an attention to the balance of flavors and textures that I can promise you a total sensory experience. Lastly, the staff are ever present when you need them and always discrete enough to know when you are engaged in conversation so as to not disturb.  To my friends in Toronto and Manhattan, this is now our go-to place when in Montreal.  Thank you Tina, for making our evening so incredible while we enjoyed catching up with our friends,"}
{"text":"Really wanted sushi and this was the closest place. Seemed like it has just opened, both by the lack of people inside and no reviews. Lots of seating, but only 5 people there when I arrived. Sushi was good, fresh, but nothing to rave about. Service was a bit slow, despite the lack of customers."}
{"text":"We just tried this place yesterday. What a neighborhood gem!!  The presentation is exquisite and the sushi is perfection. The staff was extremely friendly. We were there with our kids and they ate very well. This is an ideal place for a date or to gather with people who love food."}
{"text":"Belle presentation des assiettes, grand local avec 2 etage pour les receptions privée aussi. Bon service. Ambiance de bar puisque c'est un lounge sushi."}
