{"text":"Love this place. Great butcher with a wide variety of meats. Great in-house chorizo. I also love the al pastor, chicharones, and blood sausage. Amazing selection of fresh tortillas, including a few from North Carolina companies. Plus limes  are 5 for $1.  The restaurant in the back is great too. Fucking legit tacos, and the best tortas I've found in Charlotte.   Oh and the whole place is very clean and has English signs. In case you worry about that kinda stuff."}
{"text":"Located in the rear of this supermarket, the small, clean restaurant (with characteristic loud tv) has a walk up counter to order. They will bring your food to you after a bit of a wait (fresh, not frozen, made order), but when you get it be ready for a flashback to your trip to old Mexico. One thing: I'm not a fan of the chicken as it is a bit tasteless and ground, other than that the other proteins are pretty good."}
{"text":"This is really only a review for their chicharon . It's sold by the meat section and is the best fried pork rinds I've ever had - can't go back to \"packaged\" or bagged pork rinds after you go fresh made. It is both crunchy and has some \"heft\" to it so it doesn't feel like eating fat air. I want to go back to try their fast food though looked really good too."}
{"text":"Head straight to the back and get some tacos! I'm from Southern California and this is the closest I can get to authentic Mexican food in Charlotte. I speak minimal Spanish but my order is fairly simple so I get by. The salsa verde is great but the guacamole is a little too spicy for me so don't make the mistake of loading up before you try it!"}
