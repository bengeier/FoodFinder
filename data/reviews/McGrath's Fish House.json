{"text":"I am so sad to learn that the place is now closed.  I loved it!  Luckily, I had the chance to go there about 3 weeks ago and enjoyed an awesome lunch with a friend and we were there for 3 1/2 hours and they never tried to kick us out.  (it wasn't busy or anything so that always helps).  I'll have to find the next closest one."}
{"text":"Bad service...waited 15 after being seated, went to host and asked for a server to be sent to the table. Most tables empty....food was not good, over-cooked and dry.  I bet they will close soon."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago my lunch was bland & tasteless so I decided to give them another chance today. Seating was very quick; they aren't crowded at lunch. Wait staff took my order of grilled salmon, veggies, salad and one side dish.  I chose coleslaw and WOW--- all hell broke out!!  \"You can't have a coleslaw because it comes with a vegetable.\"  OMG!! Call Mrs Obama & the White House veggie garden to my rescue.   Calmly I pointed to the coleslaw on the list of approved side dishes. After a 20 minute wait the salad & bread were served. Then within 3 minutes my main dish was brought out. There is no coleslaw. Round 2: Where is my coleslaw? Can't a girl get a coleslaw around here? The reply was\" oh, yes, another vegetable.\"  It took another 5 minutes to get my coleslaw. Yes, I kept checking my watch. Just wondering if the cabbage could be shipped from Australia or Chile  faster.   Wood fired grilled salmon was tasty, broccoli & carrots were still firm, not overcooked, bread was warm & salad was ok. Coleslaw with a few shredded carrots on top was just bland and had little flavor; it really needed some spices to give it a kick."}
{"text":"My family lives about 5 miles from this place.  After moving here several years ago we stumbled on this place looking for a non-chain place (yeah I know it is a semi-chain, but not huge).  Since that first time was several years ago, I will not put in a review on that experience (which was 5 stars, easy).  We probably go at least once every 2 months, now.  I almost always get the Fisherman's Stew.  L O V E it.  I am not sure what that manic-depressed chick from Cali was talking about in describing it.  I put hot sauce in everything (no offense), so I tried it 'dry' (no hot sauce) and it was good.  However, throw some Chipotle Tabasco in it?  Uh, what?  Crazy g()()d.  I generally get that and either the ahi app or a salad of some sort.  The ahi app is great, the salads are fine.  The bread by the way is excellent.  My wife usually gets the Coconut shrimp app as a meal.  Her favorite dish just about anywhere.    My wife and eldest daughter always get the clam chowder.  My daughter says she dreams about it sometimes, and when I mention McGrath's she generally goes nuts and demands we get in the car much faster than we are doing.  I sampled it a few times and it is in my top ten I think.  Good stuff.  She also likes the kid's fettucini alfredo.  My son _loves_ the kid's fish n chips.  He usually does not eat fish but he destroys this dish quite quickly.  My younger daughter eats a little of everything and never has any issues.  The only problem we have ever had here is the service.  Usually it is hit or miss.  I would say 25% of the time we get pretty crappy service.  Generally this means they are quite slow, or keep messing up the order and/or forgetting to bring out something.  It really boggles my mind that this happens.  The last 3 times, for instance, not great service.  By service I mean the waiter/waitress.  The up-front hostesses are effecient.  The one time I sat at the bar she was dang good.  Since the food is so dang good though, we will certainly be back.  My kids love coming here, as do we adults.  I cringe when I get certain servers, though......"}
{"text":"The fish was gross and the service was aweful :( we were really looking forward to going and were so disappointed with the outcome :( Looked and tasted like it was from the freezer section in the market, and our waitress was the absolute worst. Will never, ever go back"}
{"text":"Although we live in California, we have family near Mesa and have eaten at McGrath's in Mesa twice, including this evening.   I say \"eaten\" rather than \"dined\" because McGrath's is not fine dining, it is fun eating. There were five of us tonight, and all of our meals were well prepared, well presented, and completely consumed. Was the food extraordinary? Nope. But it was definitely better than ordinary and the prices were very reasonable. No wonder my brother-in-law offered to pay! (Actually he's a generous fellow, but it did happen to be his sister's birthday.)  The two desserts ordered at our table -- mud pie and marion-berry cobbler, were both a cut above. I didn't sample the mud pie, but it was a very generous size -- enough for two people or one brother-in-law. The cobbler was served in an \"individual\" pie plate, with the crust overflowing the edges and done just right.  The service was solid, with a knowledgeable waitress who was attentive without being pushy. She wasn't as fast as Apolo Anton Ohno, but no one passed out from hunger before the food arrived, and she was working a fairly good area.  If you're looking for a decent meal in a pleasant setting with reasonable prices, consider McGrath's. If you're looking for an outstanding fish-house, I know this little place in Palo Alto...."}
{"text":"This might be the worst food I have ever eaten. At least I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I haven't had seafood in a while and this place really hit the spot.  Salmon tasted great, as well as the clam chowder and the excellent sourdough bread that came with it all.  Good stuff for those looking for some good fish."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  3 of us had different entrees-all were fine."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to eat fish on the west side, I'd definitely recommend McGrath's.  I've eaten here several times, most recently last week.  My biggest pet peeve about most fish served in restaurants is that it's overcooked, but McGraths's fish is always moist and fresh tasting.  I'm counting calories, and they offered the veggies and potatoes \"naked\", without any sauce, but still very good.  The wine selection isn't very extensive, but I'd say that was my only complaint.  Just remember this is the desert, and keep the expectations realistic."}
{"text":"Tried to pop into White Chocolate Grill the other night only to find an hour and a half wait.  Should have waited!  Instead we walked across the parking lot and found a cheap seafood chain that is actually worse than Red Lobster.  Please stay away as you will only be disappointed by their failure at every turn.  The only reason for the second star was that our server was actually quite funny.  We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and sat at the bar.  The bartender was slammed with work and getting no support for the longest time.  He finally served us with drinks and took our food order.  The bar was quite busy and the bartender was out of clean glasses and yet the (really weak) manager just cruised thru the bar.  The manager then decided to help out and you could tell the bartender was very thankful.  He told us he was sorry at least ten times during our visit.   The quality of the food was good and we will return.  I do believe this place would be a better place if they replaced the manager.   Poor management!!!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why there's two different pages for the same restaurant, but regardless this restaurant is CLOSED!  I would've given the restaurant three stars for inconsistent service, but hurry up and mark this closed so you don't give false hope of close seafood."}
{"text":"Was Aileen B. with me?  Actually, a couple of friends and I had dinner here last night, and if it were not for the terrific service, I would not have given this restaurant 3 stars.  The food was simply not good.  But where else in Scottsdale can one get a meal for $14.99, including bread and salad!?  The martini's were darn good, and a great bartender knows that we want that extra little yummy bit that is left in the shaker once he's poured!  This bartender did not disappoint.  My friends and I were celebrating our birthdays.  After two drinks, we had the courage to ask the Server if he could convince the General Manager and the Vice President (who were visiting that day) to come over and sing us Happy Birthday.  The General Manager did so with a smile on his face.  It's so sad when there is great service like this that the food is not better.  Where will these great Servers go when the place closes down?"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since the place opened. Its some what of a chain, but not a very big one. I have definately seen an improvement over the years from when it opened to what it is now. It definatley has gone from bad to good to better. Its a good alternative to Red Lobster. All their specials are fresh, not frozen, and its usually a different special a night. So if you see something on the special menu, make sure to get it because you might never see it again.  It can get on the pricey side rather quickly depending on appetizers, main course, alcohol, and desert. We usually run the gambit every time we go there doing a 3 course meal.  My wife and I have tried to go a few times in the last couple of weeks on a Thursday or Wednesday and the place is packed, with an over an hour wait. We never had that back in the day. I think this just attests to where it has started at, and where it is has gotten to now working out all the problems. Its not perfect, but the food decent every time we go. I personally think this place is a step up from Red Lobster because of how fresh their fish is."}
{"text":"I have been five times now. Not once have I had a decent meal. So if a friend suggests we go, I will send them on thier way while I go somewhere good."}
{"text":"McGraths in Scottsdale is CLOSED!!!!!  The wife and I actually stepped in for lunch here today and they have a pretty affordable lunch menu. We both had halibut and shrimp fried with french fries. very good stuff! The Cole Slaw is also very good, creamy and flavorful. Coming from the Pacific North West I am very particular about fish. This halibut was white, solid and flaky. I'll be trying out the Soup and Salad next time. Gotta' have good clam chowder or it just aint' a fish house!"}
{"text":"So, shame on me for not taking the reviews of this place seriously and actually suggesting it for lunch today.  It happens to be in a convenient location (in chain restaurant hell off of Stapley and the 60) and we've had drinks there a couple of times.  It's really a pretty restaurant inside....too bad the food doesn't live up to the atmosphere.  They've been advertising $5.99 lunch specials via their email list, so I thought it might be worth a try.    The large  menu seems fairly impressive and includes fresh seafood, fried specialties, pasta, salads and a long list of sandwiches and wraps.  We opted to share the Calamari Salad and the fried  Alaskan Cod/Shrimp/Chicken lunch.  We should have been forewarned when the food suddenly appears within five minutes of ordering.  To put it nicely, the salad just plain sucked.  The menu describes it as a Greek salad....NOT.  Wilted romaine lettuce tossed with some sort of sickeningly sweet poppyseed dressing (WTH?) and a few pieces of calamari on top.  I will say, however, that the tender, non-greasy pieces of calamari are the reason why I'm NOT giving this place one star.  The fried platter was OK...she ate the fish and I ate the shrimp and chicken.  The fries weren't bad...just nothing to write home about and the cole slaw was barely passable.      The service wasn't much better than two stars as well....I mean just because we're drinking H2O with lemon and not having cocktails doesn't mean you can ignore our need for refills. On our last visit we sat at the bar and ordered martinis...I guess that doesn't count.  Anyway, we didn't pay for the salad (thank God) and I left starving..it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish.  I'm embarressed to say it, but I'm sure Red Lobster would have been a better option, or, even Long John Silvers for that matter :("}
{"text":"I will bet my money that the fish is frozen!! It looks like those frozen breaded fish sticks that you get out of the box...remember when you were a kid? The salad was fine but the dressing I swear was the Kraft stuff - which is ok if that's what you want......somehow I was wishing that we stayed home. The quality of the meal was pretty disappointing at best - so I dont remember anything else."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place  to anyone seeking good seafood. We started with crab cakes that were sub par. My husband's steak and prawns were weak. The steak was not sirloin quality and the shrimp smelled and tasted badly. The manager was kind enough to knock off about $8 for his meal, but the plate was so bad the entire entree should have been deducted.  My snow crab legs were good, but the side veggies were not. They had a strange lemon flavor which doesn't normally accompany green beans and zucchini - which was over cooked. Squishy zucchini is never good.  Overall our only positives were the side salads.  The restaurant itself is also very dark, the lights never seemed to get brighter. Our server was pleasant but very slow. The place was not that busy so we are still not sure what took so long for the food and check to arrive. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"***This location is closed*** Received a gift card from Mcgraths after they had seen my previous review. I actually was surprised because I didnt really give them that bad a review compared to some of the others that were posted. In any event, I though it was cool that they were willing to give me a free meal. So I went to use my card at lunch one day and was disappointed to find that this location is \"closed for good\" as I was told by a woman who I guess was an employee? I am actually a bit disapointed because McGraths had a great soup and salad lunch. Not sure if there are other locations where I can use this gift card..."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the menu for this place.  W walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too.   We started with the onion rings. Fried onions how can this be screwed up? They found a way the bater was flavorless and the onions were just a bit to raw and hard. ($6)  We had our included salads and hey were good, just lettuce dressing crutons and the obligatory garnish of cucumber and carrot.  I had the MACADAMIA MAHI MAHI $11.99,the price was great, but the execution was anything but, it tasted just like the frozen stuff I can get from the store, the crust was soggy and the fish was over cooked and it did not taste fresh, this is nothing like Roy's version.  A family member go the pineapple \"shashimi grade\" ahi $11.99 This came over cooked despite asking for it seared and and too much of the white sinuous Grissel in it for a \"quality\" ahi.  I really want this place to be good, but it just was not."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Was looking for good seafood in the area, and hoping it wasn't overly priced. I was disappointed.   My husband got the wood grilled blackened halibut, and it was tiny. It was alright, not good not awful, and overpriced for the size. He came home and ate again.   I got the steak and shrimp combo. The NY strip was inedible. 90% grissle, 5% fat, and the rest seemed to be meat. The shrimp skewer was overcooked. They were dry and had very little flavor. I sent the steak back and the replacement one was a bit better, but not enough to make me happier. By the time it arrived everyone else was done their meal.  They didn't offer to take anything off the menu or compensate us in any way for the sad food. My daughter had the chicken tenders and didn't like them either. The breading was very heavy and over done.   In all, skip it. Red Lobster would probably have been better and cheaper too. Very disappointed and we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said \"they try the best they can\"  hmmmmmm isn't this a \"fish\" restaurant?  They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"When my parents were separating (well, they still are, except this time all their talking is done through lawyers instead of airborne furniture), my father and I used to come here a lot.   Not by choice, mind you. My brothers always had their birthdays at Red Lobster, and so it would have just reminded my dad of all the family time we had, and he'd go crazy again. The same thing happens whenever he hears Christmas music or drives by Cabella's. I wish I was making this up. I really do.  The food at McGrath's is pretty mediocre even without my association of shrimp scampi with watching my dad cry and mumble about murdering all of us when we would least expect it that my poor poor brain has developed.  The fish is sparse and overpriced, even for a seafood restaurant in a land-locked state. I mean, I might not be a fisherman or anything, but I've seen some on the discovery channel, and salmon are usually bigger than that.   And that isn't catfish. I don't care what your \"chef\" back there says, it's not. It might be someone's cat, but it is definitely not catfish.  If Fishermen actually had to subsist on that flavorless tomato puree you call \"fishermen's stew\" like you claimed they did, there'd be no fishermen. Nor would there be any whalers. And Bob Marley would have never found a backup band.  I'm just grateful that my dad ruined this place for me, and not, you know, a real fish house.   I would have never recovered."}
{"text":"We have been passing by this place for years.  We always mentioned we will stop in to try the food one day.  Well after 4 years the day finally came.  My hubby whipped into the parking lot with a sharp right turn.  I guess he was that hungry or really wanting to try this place?  We got there at one of those in between times 3:45pm, so the place was dead.  I do not care as long as the food and service is good.  We were greeted and seated pretty quickly.  Cool!  The server was good and ok.  We were always checked on and drinks were always full but she did not have any emotions.  Not sure if she did not want to be there or what??  We ordered: Half dozen of the blue point shucked oysters on the half shell - Ok, a little too sandy  Sesame chicken tenders appetizer (Freshly breaded and served with our Homemade Honey Mustard Sauce) - This was surprising very good.  Lunch portion of the Sesame Ahi (Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds, seared medium rare with a ponzu sauce. Served with Garden Salad, fresh vegetables, and red potatoes) - My hubby said this was very very good.  The Ahi was dead on.    I will be coming back to try the other items on the menu.  I think the place is ok, I do not love it yet."}
{"text":"If you have Cracker Barrel, or Claim Jumper listed as your favorite restaurants, McGrath's is right up your alley! Honestly, the restaurant is nice, the wait staff was fine, the food was edible. But it's corporate food.....plain and simple.  Have a Claim Jumper clone Cobb Salad, a forgettable stuffed flounder.  Boring.  Conclusion: Save McGrath's for that business lunch where you don't want to offend anyone. But don't look for any kudos regarding your creativity....take them to the San Diego Bay Restaurant in Guadalupe instead. And watch those bonuses just keep on comin'!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family for dinner, even though it was the first friday of lent they got us in pretty quick. The combos appetiser was on the small side but our salads were fresh and everything came quickly. Food was pretty good, good prices for seafood, seafood jambalaya was yummy. Would come again as a alternate to red lobster."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here on Saturday night.  I say \"tried\" because we never ended up seeing our server.  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full.  The thing is, our server never came.  Never.  No \"hello\", no \"I'll be with you in a moment\", nothing.  Very strange, since the place was NOT busy.  A confused busboy walked by, and another waiter walked by, but nobody every came to our table.  WTF!?  We left after 10 minutes.  So, definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times, and I have been pleased almost without exception for every visit. The daily specials are very fresh and usually enticing, and their regular menu is fairly diverse. I had Gulf oysters as an appetizer, and although they're a bit pricey and small, they tasted fresh. (Be prepared to make your own coctail sauce.)  I've had a seared tuna dish that didn't impress me much, but I've been very pleased with the salmon, flounder, crab cakes and other fish dinners. Everything tasted fresh. It's an amazing bargain... these entrees are very good dinners at the Chili's/Applebees price range. Kid's menu is extensive and affordable. I recommend it as an affordable dinner."}
{"text":"Went there to meet someone after I've already ate at Olive garden on Sunday (read previous review). It was 7 pm and this place was EMPTY! I was bit surprised. We walked in towards bar area. there were only 2 other people there. We weren't hungry, but I can always eat (as I'm munching on kimchee right now), especially seafood. so I glazed thru their menu. I noticed 'micro brew' in beer section. Since I love beer, I asked if they brew their own (hence, micro-brew...) She pointed out bluemoon, sam adams, and something else... Ummmm, I have never seen any restaurant categorize them as \"Micro-Brew\" oh well, I got bluemoon. $4.25 for a pint.   My friends had ahi-tuna salad. I glazed thru the menu some more for food, but nothing really sounded good...  It was a very short trip to the place. Had a beer, and left. by the time we left (8pm) they've already shut down the dinning area.   I guess we won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service, empty restaurant, salty broth, EXCELLENT live oysters  --server didn't know the menu. Not seeing a \"raw bar\" platter, I asked for it, was rebuffed and then saw \"raw bar\" options in the separate drinks menu --the live oysters were awesome. So tasty! --restaurant is cavernous but there is no one dining here.   Go try the oysters."}
{"text":"We just had the worst dining experience since we have moved here at this place.   We had been regularly eating here about once a week, and even recommended it to some friends, however since we first starting frequenting this location, the service and quality of food has been sliding downhill over time.   Tonight was the final straw so to speak, we will not return. After having to wait a ridiculous amount of the time while the manager got our table ready (It was not crowded at all, and he could be seen back in the kitchen doing things.)   After a ten minute delay, we were finally seated, and we waited, and after about five more minutes we were about to get up and leave when the manager came over to take our drink order. About 7-10 minutes later a waitress finally came to the table, to verify our drink and appetizer order (why?) so we had to wait another couple minutes for our drinks (water.)   When the appetizer finally came, my salad and my fiance's clam chowder were on the tray, at which point the waitress asked if we wanted the two items with our appetizer. We said yes, because why would we want to wait when they have already been thawed, and the waitress had already brought them.   It was another 10-15 minute wait till out entrees arrived, and mine was not what I ordered. I asked the waitress and she said \"Yes that is what you ordered\" then backtracked and said she would check with the kitchen.   Apparently the manager said it was okay to prepare me the proper order, but I was not notified. So after sitting and waiting another ten or fifteen minutes the waitress came by and asked if I had been told that they were preparing the correct dish. I said no, and she said it would be out soon. The Manager never came by our table, for I think he did not want to hear the complaints since it was obvious we were not happy, especially after all the wait time. Finally about 5 minutes after the waitress informed me that I would get the proper meal, it came out, and was obviously \"hurried.\"   We asked for the check, and received yet another ten minute wait, and when we looked at it, I was appalled that we were given no discount whatsoever for the issues. The Manager still never came by our table, and would not even look in our direction.   This place is such a disappointment, when we started eating there it was great, well priced, good service, good quality. The last 4-5 times we have been there it has been horrible, and tonight was the worst. I really do hope that the Owner/Managers see my review, for they have lost our business, and we ate there frequently, and we will not continue to tell people to try it."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't get a chance to read the reviews here before I had my first visit, or I may not have given McGrath's a chance!  I arrived shortly after 11a (when my first visit to White Chocolate Grill turned out to be a bust since all of their breads contained corn syrup or some other allergen and so did the desserts- it struck me that the server had had enough of checking with the kitchen, so I decided I'd save him more trouble and take my business elsewhere) and was one of their first customers, so perhaps this led to my not having any problems with service.    I found it refreshing to be able to ask the manager, who served as the host that morning, many questions and have him immediately know the answers (he only had to go back maybe twice).  This means that I don't get to annoy my server as much, although the server that day was very friendly and understanding- she also has a few food allergies to grapple with!  I had the parmesan-crusted cod, with veggies and wild rice.  However, the rice had allergens, but the server didn't even hesitate to ask what I'd like to substitute it with.  No frowns, no annoyed pauses.  Excellent service.  Afterwards, she even offered a complimentary birthday sundae!"}
{"text":"I was invited back after my previous review and we went back (before my wonderful return to vegetarianism) and it was better.  Service was friendly food was decent.  It is what it is for sure you're not getting super fresh but at least this time it was prepared well and the service was A LOT better.  I won't be returning because they're without a single vegetarian option but for those in desperate need of a seafood fix I'd check it out just keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience their last year, complained to corp they sent me a 'sorry letter' and gift card for $25. So I went back, and things were noticeably better, but was still quite dead in the place.  Then a few weeks ago I drove by an noticed that it was closed down."}
{"text":"Not the best place, but not the worst place either.  It's right down the street from my house so I end up going as a last resort to the numerous chains on this side of town.    Came on Cinco de Mayo and it was dead.    They highly recommended the side of corn, but it was not good at all.  We sent it back and got french fries instead.  Those weren't that great either.    Oh well..."}
{"text":"Went here with my girls for Father's day :)  They have an excellent kids menu, reasonable prices on their food and drinks. Good service (likely because they are surprisingly empty). I like the atmosphere and assume it would be more fun with a packed house. Note: this is a family joint - not a romantic getaway.  The scallops were decent, my grilled shrimp was good, baked potato was pathetically small. Both kids got the popcorn shrimp kids-meals, which they enjoyed."}
{"text":"Ho-hum. Why do we always wind up at average chain restaurants. I'm firmly placing blame on someone else, namely my partner. I like to plan, he doesn't, so we wind up at average or less than average chain restaurants.   We tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: \"I'm really hungry.\" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath's Fish House. Since we'd been to White Chocolate and McGrath's would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath's. This was not the better of the two choices.  They seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we're both very uncomfortable.  The good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King's Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner's platter was also just okay. He said there's no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur.   Another average chain restaurant. You can do better than this!"}
{"text":"Over the years, McGrath's has been hit or miss for me, more hit than miss....but last night was a home run.  We had a party of 10, mom was taking the whole family out on the last night we were all in town for the holidays and she is a fish fanatic.  We had a very motivated and attentive waiter (Aaron) who got all of our special orders correct and did a bang up job.  Two in the party were little kids and the menu was exceptionally kid-friendly.  Everything you can imagine from a fish house was offered and each meal we chose was unique, fresh and delicious.  I believe that if you are in the mood for fish and stuck in the desert, this is a great place to visit, you will not be disappointed!!"}
