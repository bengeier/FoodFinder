{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant.  Finally a Mexican restaurant that truly serves real Mexican food. Not just nachos and burritos and such but truly good cevice, and stewed meats with the real flavors of the country it's proud to represent.  The service was fabulous and the prices are reasonable. Love it."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant;) Quaint quiet atmosphere, staff very friendly. I had the steak asada, done just right served with chilaquiles, sprinkled with cheese. Delicious. Portions are ample, and very reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"We were a group of 14.  Very authentic Mexican food. Everyone loved it. It was a Friday night and the place filled up fast. I had Fiatas. Which were excellent. My friend had a chicken dish that she raved about"}
{"text":"Good traditional mexican. I ordered takeout so maybe did not see presentation at its best. All in all, its real Mexico, I'm difficult as i know the cuisine and remain unimpressed when comparing to taquerias or traditional joints in Mexico city"}
{"text":"Plats excellents. Service client impeccable. La soupe Aztèque et la barbacoa sont délicieux..."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican fare.  Family-run business, super friendly and accommodating.  I've tried over half the menu and haven't been disappointed by any dish!  Ask for their hot sauce, you won't be disappointed!  It's the only Mexican resto I'll be going to from here on end."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in verdun! I had the tacos al pastor and my boyfriend had the carne asada served with chilaquiles. We drank a margarita and a michelada. It was good food! The man who welcomed us was super friendly. Will be going back a huevo!  Since my first visit, I've returned a few times with different people and every time, our friends have enjoyed this place. We've tried the cochinita pibil, the enchiladas verdes, the mole verde, the ceviche and the sopa azteca; everything is delicious. I think you can pretty much order anything on the menu and it'll be yummy! Provecho!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Authentic. Family run restaurant. Fresh. Can't wait to come back and try something else. Feels like a five star restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellente place  Super bouffe Très bonne portion Service attentionné Ce resto est devenu notre petit resto du coin que nous allons les vendredis soir La terrasse est très aussi Je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"Nourriture authentique et toujours excellente. Restaurant probablement géré par une famille, toujours super acceuillent Et à l'écoute. Notre classique de Verdun."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Mexican place in the hood! Came here on an early dinner date and had a nice time. The service was prompt and friendly, the space was simply and tastefully decorated. We arrived around 5:30 and the place was empty but it started to fill up with customers as we were eating. We started with the guacamole and chips and it was a small-ish portion to share (which I actually appreciated, I didn't want to spoil my appetite). Guac was really tasty. I had the pork tacos (can't remember what they're called on the menu now) and they were good. My boyfriend had the mole poblano chicken and he loved the sauce but said the chicken was disappointingly dry. Overall it was pleasant. Not mindblowing but I'll probably be back next time I'm craving Mexican!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tried this place on a whim and very pleasantly surprised! Sooo delicious. The service was fast and everyone was smiling! Really authentic Mexican dishes and very reasonable price. A new favorite."}
{"text":"The service was really lovely and I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I can't recommend it. I ordered the chicken mole and despite being warned about the spice level, it was really bland and the meat was dry and overcooked. The guacamole we had as an appetizer was great though."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Whilst the menu is not too varied, the tacos al pastor are to die for. They always treat me very well when I go whether I'm with friends or family, and it's a quite cozy and clean place. Packed over the weekends so make sure to reserve beforehand if you plan to go on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Une agréable surprise pour ma famille et moi. Quoi de mieux que déguster une cuisine mexicaine authentique, servie avec attention, dans une ambiance conviviale et chaleureuse ? Une adresse à mettre dans votre carnet, si vous êtes du genre à préférer l'authenticité? en cuisine plutôt que le cliquant et les égos surdimensionnés de certains restaurants montréalais..."}
{"text":"Came here with my authentic Mexican friend in tote to see how this place fares to a Mexico native....I was pleased to have him confirm it was in fact pretty dang authentic. He did note a few gringo-fied elements but as I pointed out, and we both agreed, it's hard not to incorporate a bit of local flavour into one's cooking style regardless of where they're from.  The service was fabulous and friendly and thanks to my friend speaking Spanish the whole time really helped maintain that authentic feel to the place.   We started with two types of fondu the fundida and the choriqueso both were delicious and super filling! You must ask for hot sauce on the side because they are homemade and soooooo gooooooood (probably my favorite part of the whole meal!). Don't be afraid to ask for super super spicy either because I'm not a huge fan of things that are too spicy (but I do appreciate a good kick) and even their spiciest sauce asked for by my friend was not enough to scare me away.   The main dishes...well to be honest we both found the meats a bit on the dry side. But they were quality and delish none-the-less. I tried mole pablano for the first time...it will likely be the last time for me too because I just don't dig cocoa chicken lol but it was made well and my friend confirmed its authenticity so if you're a fan of mole go ahead and try it! My friend tried the barbacoa despite it being Monday (traditionally barbacoa is ONLY served on the weekends as a special dish in Mexico) because he wanted to see how it compared to his gramma's...well apparently it was too dry and too lean but otherwise cooked nicely and went lovely with the corn tortillas and cactus salad.   We of course had deserts to finish with and I had a café latte. The flan my friend ordered had no sauce around it and was a bit dry. The treis leche I ordered was fairly good and quite moist. However unfortunately they put this weird fake-cherry-cough-syrup-tasting drizzle underneath both deserts as decoration and it damn near ruined them both (really blech!! Ask for it without the red syrup if u can, trust me). They also put cinnamon on my latté which is a real piss off for me but i was able to spoon off all the foam that had cinnamon so problem solved and otherwise a really good latté.  For the 2 entrées, 2 main dishes, 2 deserts, a glass of wine, a glass of coke, a glass of milk and the latté the bill came to ~93$ so a bit on the pricey side...as my friend said \"not a place I'd bring a first date to\" lol. But I will definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, no more driving up the hill into foreign neighborhoods to taste authentic Mexican food. This small restaurant had only few tables occupied on Wednesday night, quiet and relaxing atmosphere, and clientele that obviously consists of local residents. The place is not fancy, but there are the Mexican music and few typical for the region decoration elements.   The food was delicious, so were the cocktails. My preferences are with the guac and the tacos al pastor. There is no need to order the cactus salad as an appetizer if you have chosen the lamb dish, small bowl of the same salad comes with it. The strawberry daiquiri was magic.    Nice service, attractive menu, I'm coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Tonight we tried a new restaurant and since my cravings have leaned toward Mexican food, something I haven't had in quite some time, we decided to try El Sabor De Mexico located on Wellington in Verdun.  We had made a reservation since I didn't know how busy it would get right after work on a Friday night.  When we arrived, there was one other party of 6 people and by the time we left around an hour later, the room was beginning to fill up.  I have honestly never had \"authentic\" Mexican food before- so I didn't know what to expect.    We started off with the guacamole appetizer and it was some of the best guac we've ever had.  We did wish they had more tomatoes on top of it- but it really is so good.  My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada and the steak was DELICIOUS.  It was cooked perfectly and I wish I had ordered it by the end of the meal.  I had ordered the Enchiladas Rojas since I had read other good reviews of it.    While it was good, I don't think I would order it again.  I ate a third of the plate and took the rest to go.  Let's just say, I would definitely try their fajitas or have the Carne Asada next time.  The staff is really polite, although they don't seem to know how to speak english very well, which is not a bad thing, of course.  The service is quick and the ambiance is really cozy. Overall, we had a really nice time and I think my boyfriend will be drooling over the steak until the next time."}
{"text":"I'm actually not a big fan of Mexican food. Correction: I'm actually not a fan of Mexican fast-food. Tacos, burritos, Carlos and Pepes, 3 Amigos, that sort of stuff.  But authentic, regional hard-to-find Mexican dishes? Bring it on.  Years ago I read an article in Air Canada's magazine \"enRoute\" while on a flight about a woman who was in search of \"Chiles en Nogada\" (Chillies in Walnut Sauce), a dish invented by Mexican nuns and involves soaking shelled walnuts in milk overnight in order to make them that much easier to peel, using those peeled walnuts and crushing them in order to make a heavenly sweet sauce (any skin left on the nuts and the sauce will come out sour) which is then poured over a roasted green poblano chile, which has been stuffed with \"picadillo\", a complicated mix of braised meat, candied barrel cactus and the shaggy Mexican cinnamon called canela. The whole thing is then sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.   The nuns made this dish to commemorate Mexico's day of independence, since the colours of the dish represent the colours of Mexico's flag (white sauce, green chile, red pomegranate) and it is usually served in the first two weeks of September in very few Mexican restaurants. It is a very rare dish to find outside of Mexico. You will never find this dish at Three Amigos or Carlos and Pepes because it is very complicated and involves painstaking work to prepare.  El Sabor De Mexico is in my hood and while I have walked by countless times since it opened 8 months ago, I yet had a reason to go in. Well, I walked by and I saw a special poster in their window, that they were serving chiles en nogada from Sept. 11- Sept 16 in celebration of Mexican independence. I knew I had to try it.  Reader, it was wonderful.  I now understand why this dish is one of the Holy Grails of Mexican cuisine, all the flavours have to work together and not one should overpower the others. I could tell immediately the walnut sauce was authentic, I could see and taste the sweet ground walnut in a snow-white creamy sauce, the candied cactus and the nuts in the meat stuffing, the combination looks deceptively simple yet is astounding in taste. I then followed up with the coconut flan for dessert which came with a doll-like jug of an alcoholic-based sauce to pour over the flan. It was rich, creamy, decadent, not too sweet and hit the spot.  The servings weren't large at all, but this was another clue that everything was authentic. I find \"real\", authentic food is usually quite rich and fills you up because of the quality of the ingredients and I was quite full after the chiles en nogada and the flan.   Prices are higher than usual but this is authentic Mexican, not Taco Bell. The people here are really nice and friendly and now that I know how great the food here is, I'm not going to wait another 8 months before coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Grosse déception: après avoir lu tant de commentaires encourageants et prometteurs, nous avons réservé pour 6 adultes et 3 enfants.....25mn d'attente pour les entrées, simples nachos et guacamol....+ 45mn d'attente pour les plats....aucune courtoisie ou attention de la part de la serveuse. Pas un mot! Je n'y retournerai pas et ne le recommande pas. Le rapport qualité prix est franchement décevant....que  le contenu de nos assiettes n'ai rien d'extraordinaire ne me dérange pas tant que la lenteur du service et le mauvais accueil."}
{"text":"The Ceviche is truly outstanding. Kicked the meal of the charts. The veggie enchilada was unique with a killer sauce. Vampiro cocktail and margheritas were excellent.   Loved the atmosphere and the service."}
