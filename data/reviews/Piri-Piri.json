{"text":"Interesting Place! 
I love the Shrimp Soup and the sausage in 'flame'. We should have had the Seafood Platter but instead we got the steak. The owner was friendly and so were the staff, but super busy place on a Saturday night. Great place for casual Portuguese dining."}
{"text":"Been going here for a number of years and alway enjoy the food and service. Try the Gamba La Plancha. These shrimp are the closest taste I have found to found memories I have of traveling in Europe when I was younger, the grilled sea bass is a winner with hubby."}
{"text":"Hit and miss! We have found the best time to go here is when the owner/ manager is around. The food and service are much better when he's around.Don't go otherwise!
Tried the grilled sardines, would not order again. Love their Piri-Piri sauce!"}
{"text":"Good Portuguese food, not great. A bit pricey for Portuguese food in the area. Better choices out there."}
{"text":"Being portuguese/italian . . . this place is pathetic!!!!!

Portuguese culture is very much salt-of-the-earth, down-to-earth  etc. Our food reflects our working-class sensibility . . . rustic, country-style, family food. 

Our 'cuisine' is popular because it's accessible and absolutely deeeelish IE fresh seafood, bbq chicken, grilled steak with egg on top (bitoque) etc.

Piri-Piri - poser resto, so waaaaaay pretentious they're f**kin delusional . . . WTF???

$23 cod fish

{"text":"The food was delicious. They get 4 stars for the food because the main course was delicious, but the bread that they served us for the first hour was cold and they only brought butter after being asked a few times. And the desert was flan, and I happen to dislike flan. Someone else at my table said it was pretty good, if that helps.
Which brings me to why they got two stars: TERRIBLE service.
Our waiter was almost non-existent. He forgot drinks and simple requests (case in point: the butter), and when he did remember it was over half an hour later.

The entire dining experience was FOUR HOURS. It should not take this long for a waiter to come around and get food on the table and drink orders taken and drinks brought out. A long island ice tea took 25 minutes. A tea later on in the evening took 40 minutes and he didn't bring, or even offer, milk/cream.

It takes two seconds to stop by your table and say, \"how is everyone doing here?\" That never even happened once. I had to flag this guy down everytime I wanted something.

The tables are WAY too close together. The table next to ours bumped their chairs into mine numerous times (without apology), and I ended up with some woman leaning on my chair with her fingers on my back, in spite of my casual hints by \"stretching\" and bumping into her \"by mistake\". One of the patrons bumped the waiter and I had empty cans flying into my head.


Again, the food was great. Really enjoyed the food. But I will not be dining here ever again. The only way I will eat from this place in the future is if it is takeout and someone else goes in to get it for me."}
{"text":"Coming from a Portuguese background, I'm always looking for a great place to dine and be brought back to the memories of my favourite flavours. 

Piri Piri is a great place for families, and all. With a variety of typical Portuguese foods ranging from chicken, to steaks, cod and seafoods, they serve up a great dish every time. 

Right when you're seated, you're often served a bread basket with some fresh sliced  buns, and also some sliced corn bread which is to die for! You can ask for butter, however there is also some red wine vinegar and olive oil on the table which when mixed together makes for a great dip!

I usually order the bitoque which is a steak typically served with fries, rice, egg and pickled veggies. The steak also has sauce/gravy over it which I really do look for in this dish. Huge portion, great tastes and possibly the best I've tried in TO so far! The fries are fresh cut, not at all the frozen type that many Portuguese grill houses tend to serve, so it's really great!

They also have this orange spicy piri piri house sauce which is so amazing! I pour it on everything it's so great! Good amount of heat and flavour which is amazing.

Highly recommend for events, fancy dining area is perfect and really enjoyable with all it's decor."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for all different occasions. I have never been disappointed with the food. When I am craving some good seafood this is where I go. Their seafood is well seasoned and flavorful. It isn't just steamed and drizzled with lemon juice. I have had the seafood platter. It is a bit pricey but is worth it. It says its enough for 2 people but it could feel at least 4. It comes with lobster, crab legs, muscles, scallops, HUGE prawns, clams, and squid and rice. It was delicious . The only downfall would be that the service isn't the greatest. They aren't friendly and welcoming. Our waiter didn't say much just brought us what we asked for but with an attitude."}
{"text":"Great little portugese restaurant, feels at home and great service. Seafood is very good mussels amazing."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice when searching for Portuguese food.  can be a bit hit n miss at times but for the most part pretty good.  My go to dish is the fried fish-they do it well
They also had a seafood platter that I remember being quite good back in the day"}
{"text":"Meh. Not much to offer the vegetarian, which works if they're packing a meat punch, or mean punch, or whatever. Alas, it seems that none of their meaty entrees was anything special either, not even the much-touted piri-piri sauce. Skip dinner and go bouldering right behind this mediocre spot."}
{"text":"Good food and ambiance, and also great prices! 
I am a fan of the appetizer tiger prawns and their 10 oz steak done medium rare with fires. For desert I usually have a latte and a chocolate mousse. Their home made white sangria is also quite good. On Fridays and weekends, it tends to be busy.  
The decor and ambiance is very nice. The house piri piri hot sauces are excellent. Excellent place to take a date."}
{"text":"I went there a few times during lunch for their chicken which tastes all right. But I stopped going because the service is so horrible, I don't know if it's because I'm not Portuguese or maybe they're watching TV in the back and only come out to take your order during commercial breaks."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and we ordered the shrimp appetizer, grilled pork chops, grilled cod fish, and the strip sirloin steak.
The place looked tired and needs a makeover. 
Very few tables with customers.
The food was tasty and the house Piri-Piri sauce is very nice.
The only issue we had was that the chef is incapable of grilling a steak to medium. It came to us blue and when we said it was far too raw the waiter said that he thought it was medium. He lectured us that the chef didn't want to grill any steak too much as to not ruin the steak. We ask him to have it cooked to medium. It came back and he asked us to see if it was cooked to our requirement. It was now medium rare. Once again we said that it was not medium and he once again lectured us. We sent it back again with an explanation as to what a medium steak looked like. It came back the 3rd time and we checked to see if it was OK. It was medium. The waiter once again gave us the lecture as to why no one should order a steak past medium. In all it took about 20 minutes to get the steak cooked to what we asked for when we ordered the steak. At this point everyone had finished their meals. Not cool."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate the end of of our time on St Clair. It was a great choice. The place is a cut above the typical churisco place. 


The Calamari was great. Nice and tender and not rubbery. The piri piri sauce with the bread was also delicious. 
 
The steak and the baccalau (traditional Portuguese salt cod) were both wonderful. 

Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"The ambient is just ok. 

The menu shows something that set an expectation that will never be met: food is just ok, portions are sufficient to feed a kid while the final bill would settle just fine for the pockets of a Maharajah!

Food is very pricy for what you get in the end, especially when you find out that you have been billed for food you haven't eaten. 

Despite the server was cooperative to set the bill right, I found the total be still steep. 

I wouldn't recommend to spend your hard earned money in this restaurant because you can find better places for better value unless you are driving by, ridiculously starving and with a flat tire. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm convinced they put crack on that garlic sauce, absolutely delicious. I've ordered seafood and some of the specials, (veal, calamari, cod) never left disappointed. Service is nice too!"}
{"text":"Awesome Portuguese cuisine!
Try the steak with egg, it's a Portuguese favorite (Bitoque)

The service here is pretty good, and the staff is on the ball.

The Portuguese food is authentic, and very tasty and good sized portions.

Not hard to see why the joint is so busy.

Been here a few times over many years, and it;s never a dissapointment..

Also, the Custard dessert was fresh, and made perfectly!

Who could ask for more???"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm on the hunt for the best Portuguese chicken, rice and potatoes. 

This place is just about average!
The chicken didn't have any grill marks: but was cooked.. The rice was ok: barely any veggies in it.. Potatoes were ok: barely seasoned. 

Like I said. Meh!"}
{"text":"We arrived late on a Sunday and the place was nice and quiet. The staff was friendly and attentive. They have this dipping sauce 'piri piri' that is, for those who like spicy hot, is fantastic. We asked what it was and got the 'special secret recipe' response ;-) The staff was helpful in recommending dinner for us and the food was also great!! We order the octopus and the grouper from the menu... Both were done really well with lots of flavour!"}
{"text":"Over priced, nothing-to-write-home-about portuguese food.
Poor value for money proposition."}
{"text":"Old, need a face lift, but that is not very important ... they have good, very good portuguese food! The bitoque is awsome ... the shrimp soup also ... i'll return again ... for sure ... and many times!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when dropping my kid off at a rock-climbing birthday party in the complex. Though I got take-out, the dinning room was nice and looked very family-friendly. The food in the display cases looked fresh and tasty. We decided on a whole chicken and a small size rice/potatoes and salad to go. The bill came to about $23. My family of three enjoyed our dinner - it was good and properly prepared - however, it wasn't my favourite. My only complaint was that there was alot of grease in the bottom of the potato container. Piri-Piri is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as Portuguese chicken goes. I'd go back if convenient, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"This is the worst Portuguese restaurant in the city, no doubt. For starter, woman at take-out counter spoke no English \"yes, good\" was her answer to any question asked. I ordered 1 large beef, side of rice, and small salad ($14), and the salad lettuce was old and brown, and drowned in oil, the rice and beef was mediocre at best - i know women that cant cook, that still can make better tasting food. If i knew quality of food, i would not pay $5 for this order. Save your money."}
{"text":"This is the worst Portuguese restaurant in the city.  The sauce is a frozen concoction of butter and peppers.  My chicken was frozen in the middle.  The rice was a day old at least.  The bread must have been 2 days old.  My girl's calamari REEKED of fish and had an ice chunk in the middle.

If you like frozen old food this is the place to be.  If you enjoy freshly cooked Portuguese food - look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We originally ventured out with the intention of going to a different Portuguese restaurant (Cantahede), but they were closed as the owners were on vacation.  We learned this after a semi-long hike from the Metro station.  A girl working at the cafe next door told us there was another place nearby.  With that vague description, we set out walking again.

After doing a quick Yelp search (during a long walk), we found Piri-Piri, and we had walked totally out of the way.  We finally found a taxi, hopped in, and when we arrived at Piri-Piri I wanted to kiss the ground.

The interior of Piri-Piri sets the stage for something more formal (but not black tie) than we were expecting.  There were a few families dining here, but the restaurant was mostly empty.  The restaurant is clean, open, and inviting.  The décor has some splashes of Latin flavor, but it's not tacky or overdone.

We both ordered the Piri Chicken, served with rice and fries.  The piri sauce was full of spicy and garlicky goodness.  Our meals were delicious and filling, but in the end it was a bit expensive ($50 for two entrees and a beer), especially when you consider the fast-casual places serving up Portuguese chicken.  I'm happy I at least got to try Portuguese chicken, even if Piri-Piri was not our original destination.

The beer list could use some work.  Coors, Miller, Stella, but not much else was available.  They have a full bar, but no real cocktail list.

Great place for a casual lunch or dinner date if you are already in the area.  Not so great when you're sweaty and tired.  We ventured out in search of something GREAT, and Piri-Piri's food was awesome (still thinking about that sauce!), but after all of our walking, buses, and trains...Piri Piri just wasn't worth all of the craziness."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Other than everyone in the restaurant looking at me funny....I dunno if I had something on my face, or they're just not used to non-portugese patrons, but I got the distinct impression I was an uncommon sight.  It's a good thing I'm ok with being constantly stared at (haha) or I would have been uncomfortable.

On to the food...

Cream of Shrimp soup:  Delightful, though slightly salty, but just LOADED with fresh(ish) shrimp.
Hubby had the chorizo...said his mom makes it better, but he still enjoyed it
I had the 8oz Bitock (steak and a fried egg): Nicely cooked (still bleeding..mmm) though a tad grissly.  
Prices are fair, decor is old, could use a touch-up.  
The owner likes to walk around and greet his patrons, though he walked right by us..lol...
I wasn't too happy with the wait staff, only because they automatically treated me like a person who doesn't understand the language, traditions, etc.  I might look like a redneck, but I swear I'm more cultured then you think...ya hear?!?

ok maybe I'm slightly redneck..haha..but at least see if I'd LIKE to be treated like the rest of the clientelle and not an outcast that needs the english menu :P:P"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We went there on Saturday for a late lunch, we had the seafood platter for two. It was soo good. The lobster, crab legs, mussels, clams, we really enjoyed it. We are seafood lovers and we have not tried Portuguese seafood before. We will definitely go back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It has been a while since I experienced Portuguese cuisine like this! 
The place was packed when we walked in, so the slow service was understandable and definitely worth the wait. The chicken was very tender, and juicy. The grilled Octopus nice and crispy and not rubbery. However the fish filet was very oily and mushy. 

Moreover, I recommend you give this place a try. Its good for dates, Large parties, and other venues!"}
{"text":"Good food especially the appetizer shrimp and the 10 oz steak.
Can get crowded in the evenings.
The decor and ambiance is very nice.
The house peri peri hot sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"Piri-Piri is a Portuguese Churrasqueira in the Junction. I have no worthwhile adjectives for it, because I was generally unmoved by my experience here. The most emotion I felt due to Piri-Piri was in the parking lot, on my third attempt at reverse-parking. But otherwise, the experience was unspectacular.

Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely and airy space with a charming decor and competent service. There is a solarium-esque area which is somehow both outside and inside, and the high ceiings and rustic look give it some charm. Our waiter was polite and attentive, but not really remarkable in anyway. I was nonplussed. Is that the word I'm looking for?

I do have more to say about the food. Our complimentary bread was cold and unappetizing. I could have gone without. I ordered the \"half chicken seasoned with marine salt and specialty herbs, grilled and basted in \"Piri-Piri\" sauce served with rice and fries.\" It was OK. I expected the Piri-Piri sauce to be 1000x spicier, so that was a bit of the let down. The rice was bleh but the fries were pretty solid. Yay, fries.

Other yelpers have remarked how difficult it is to write a middle of the road review and I empathize here. This place is so middle-of-the-road, it deserves a five-star mediocrity rating. That is to say: it's A-OK.

Obligatory Title Pun: Snooza-squeira.

Menu Readability: I recall that it was actually decent.

Need to mention: There is parking in the back, but don't park in front of a garage door.

What this place teaches me about myself: I can't pronounce Churrasqueira."}
{"text":"If you want real portuguese frango assado. This is the place to come !! The food is very tasty and prices are decent,service is ok nothing special,but the food just drives me crazy for some reason, if i could i would eat here everyday and i would not get sick of it, there piri piri sauce is the best iv ever had if you know any better places with a piri piri like this,please let me know !! highly recommend the place for a nice evening  dinner, you will not be disappointed !!"}
