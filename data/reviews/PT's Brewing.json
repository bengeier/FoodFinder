{"text":"Fantastic new place for locally-Brewed beer. Great food! Friendly staff. It's definitely worth checking out!  We had the  Sunset Wit - and it was delicious. Also, the short ribs are amazing."}
{"text":"Have been in plenty of other pt's in the area, decided to give this one a try. Great atmosphere plenty of space and flatscreens everywhere. Had their meat lovers pizza, I forget the name of it but it started with a G. Pizza was great though and they have numerous craft beers on draft. If you like a lighter brew try their Horizon ale. It is a great specimen of a light beer. Overall great experience, the bartenders are lively and with the back and forth bar convo there was never a dull moment. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Been sitting here for an hour and only seen waitresses go to other tables.  When I try to flag them down they ignore me.  This place is not even full.  Why are they even here if I have to go to the bar to get service?"}
{"text":"Beer was just barely ok the company shouldn't rush the brewmaster, but the way they treat there players is a shame they never tell you twenty dollars only buy one comp. I may give it a try again in a few months but as of now I'm not interested in returning. They also need to better educate the bartenders on the beer they two there that night were nice and friendly but couldn't answer many questions."}
{"text":"Nice clean place and friendly bartender. Use to have the best loaded chips ever but they recently changed the potato chips to tortilla chips. Now the \"loaded chips\" are just plain nachos that aren't any better than anywhere else. Highly disappointed. One of the many reasons to come here was for happy hr and the loaded chips. Probably won't be back as
often now."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I love it the bartender John makes the bar he is so funny and attentive I love him great man the food is delicious the beer everything is fantastic John needs a promotion and A raise he makes the bar and atmosphere a tremendous place to be I always lose track of time when he is there I love the bar may God Bless John and PT's Brewery for now on this is the only bar I will recommend to friends and colleagues John is most definitely in a prestigious league of his own top of the line customer service Excellent bar and food it doesn't get any better 10 stars"}
{"text":"This place doesn't take care of the gamblers!! Played $100, had 4 beers and got a bill for $15 for 3 beers!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try out a new bar, so we headed over to the new PT's Brewing Company. We had a great time. It has a really cool atmosphere, and a great patio with nice outdoor heaters. We chilled outside on the patio all night and our server (I can't remember his name) was on point. I can't say anything about the food, as none of us ordered any. The beers are a little pricey before happy hour, when they become half price. My only complaints are that I wish they served happy hour food (other than the half off pizzas) and the large size mugs like they do at Sierra Gold and other PTs. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I suppose it's possible that I just came here on a bad night, but I doubt it. The drinks were nothing out of this world, but weren't bad. What made this a one star experience was the service. I met two friends here who were sitting in the dining area when I arrived. There were maybe six other customers in the whole place, and it took roughly ten minutes after I ordered for the \"waitress\" or whatever her title is to bring me my drink. We then relocated to the bar area which apparently caused some huge issue with the check. Two other friends then met up with us and were served fairly quickly, I'll give them that. Once they were served, the bartender sat with another employee who was not yet on the clock shooting the breeze while I sat and waited for at least 15 minutes to order another drink. The bartender then proceeded to put all of our checks together for some odd reason, and when we asked her to split them, she split the whole check in half instead of splitting them per individual. Is it not common sense to ask each person if they want to start a tab? Why would you assume that a party of five people who all walked in separately would want to be on the same check?... Not to mention that one of the people in our group had already paid for his drinks before he left, but we were charged for those drinks AGAIN on this five person check. The whole experience here was weird/unprofessional and unlike any bar I've ever been to. I almost felt as if the bartenders thought that WE were the ones inconveniencing THEM. I definitely won't be returning here and I doubt that my friends will either.

The only good thing I have to say about this bar is that they have USB ports built into the sides of the bar that can be used to charge your phone. What a concept.

Also, props to the bartender Ryan who took over after the two girls had left and actually decided to take care of us. You the real MVP, Ryan."}
{"text":"Good place to go play some pool have some drinks and just relax and have fun. Karokie if you want. Nice place to go hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"Used to come here when it was tenaya creek brewery, it was awesome then. Everyone was very personable, it was a very fun place to be. I went to the new pts today and asked about their happy hour specials, the bartender said there are none just pizza. I said really? Because on the pts website says differently. Anyways, the menu isn't the same as all other pts, the service wasn't welcoming at all besides the blonde bartender (which I forgot to ask her name). It just seemed very dead and not personable in there.  Sorry pts, should stick with what they know best and not trying to be a high end brewery..."}
{"text":"I cheated on my Craig Rd and Decatur PT'S. This place is handsomely decked out. This restaurant reminds me of my secret brewhouse in Summerlin. Good lively gang of people at the bar and in the restaurant. Let me start by praising the attentive staff, they are easy on the eyes and friendly. I ordered the Calamari and the Boulder Stout. Calamari is my personal favorite. The Boulder Stout was surprisingly tasty, I don't normally drink heavy beers, but this will be a favorite of mine. As I sat in the restaurant, I tried to think of another restaurant to compare it to. However, it's hard, it's cool like my favorite buffalo wild wings without the high school drop out crowd. PT'S Brewing is a place to come in with friends, yet, not on your own unless you sit at the bar. Most tables sit four and I felt awkward sitting by myself. It is located across the Mountain View medical building. Incidentally, your crafted beer is delivered by a man sporting a cool beard, the barkeeps are attractive, the wait staff charming and even the young guy who brought my dish looked smart. Yes, I left and quickly made north towards my pub. I can't wait to visit PT's Brewing again...I hope someday PT's can carry the beers made here."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go. There is outside seating, great for those nicer days, and staff is fantastic.  Always prompted and courteous service. They take the time to get to know you and they remember you when you come back. 

I don't know what PTs has done, but this chef knows his way around the kitchen. The food is always good. You must try the shrimp and grits, by far one of the best things on the menu. 

My favorite time to visit is Saturday afternoon or Sunday mornings. Steak and eggs, or hangover tots; ask for them by name. They are not on the menu, but should be. Delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  If memory serves it was during the great transition and PT's Brewing (PTB) was doing a soft opening.  This time around...PTB is is full operation.  Parked and walked in during happy hour and found a mellow vibe.  Lot's of different peoples just chilling, eating, gaming, drinking, watching TV, and doing a little of all the previous mentioned.  

Sat down towards the rear and took a gander at the happening in the brewery while I waited for friends.  The service was attentive and advised me I was in the happy hour.  The service kept me abreast of how long I had to enjoy the happy hour with every round....Cool.

I ordered up a Chicken Caesar Salad with steak.  When it arrived it was healthy serving, but not in the traditional meaning of healthy.  By that I mean, it was filling and left me not wanting anything more than I could sip from a glass.

Beer!  They got it.  You want some local brew...you got it.  You want some beer from someplace else..you got it.

Not a manic PT's by any stretch.  Looking for a place to chill?  This is it.  Wi-Fi is free and while putting in for tags for Utah after the group arrived, the Wi-Fi was seamless.

You can bet when I am looking for this kind of chill chill, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great local bar. Service is fantastic!! Awesome happy hour. Go see Ebru, Carly, and Heather behind the bar. They are great bartenders."}
{"text":"Service is non existent! The worst and rudest female waitresses I have ever encountered.  First one named Lopez did not even try to be nice.  Asked her what the special was, she was bored and uninterested; inquired if a cocktail was available, she proudly replied I don't know; asked her something on the  menu--- yup, I don't know! The whole persona was the opposite of what a server in this industry should be.  Next up, bartender - since we sent back a drink she comes by and says for her not to wast anymore liquor let me clarify what you want (really!).   And the next one cleared our table was no different.   Reading through the reviews, common thread is really RUDE service.   Do you really need to come here for happy hour?....any hour? NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great location across from hospital and just off interstate.  Good beer menu.  Staff very attentive,  personable, and they listen to what you say.  They food is excellent, the best I have had in the area.  I loved the calamari, especially with the jalapeño and thin lemon and lime slice,  my favorite app.  The chili was great and the chef is open to try different suggestions.
The beers are good, loved Sahara pale and hualapai ip.  
The Gilroy pizza was great, but maybe have individual pizzas also.
Definitely wii be back to try entire menu.
Highly recommend over other bars in area."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 4th visit to PT's Brewing. I've yet to have a decent meal at this place. The first time I got a Caesar wrap and it was just ok. By my second visit a week later it was already taken off the menu, so I ordered a salad. My 3rd visit I split a BBQ chicken pizza with my husband. It was good but it had way too much BBQ sauce on it. Finally on my 4th visit I got the Chicken and Quinoa salad. It was pretty bland and I couldn't even finish it. The food is just mediocre here and pretty expensive for bar food! My husband has tried a few of their beers, but didn't really like them. I'd probably come back, but just for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Great Pizza/ Great Beer/ Good table service by Rachel.
Bartenders were rude, Danny and Josett asked us not to sit at their machines.  
Good to know Golden Gaming wants machines saved for their employees, bar was empty by the way from 5 pm to 6 when we left.  
Way too many bars out there PTs to treat your custmers badly."}
{"text":"The food is underwhelming, but the beer is good enough to make up for it. Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, just doesn't live up to the atmosphere and brews. 

Really liked the Sahara Pale Ale. Reminds me of my favorite east coast beer. The stout didn't impress, but the Hulalapai IPA was amazing (saved it for last on my flight. 

The vibe of the place is great. And since it's not terribly crowded I think I could make this a regular-ish spot. A pint or two of the Sahara or Hulalipai would make for a great evening"}
{"text":"This.
Place.
Right.
Here.
OMG! The Shrimp & Grits. A MUST have.
The Cobbler Salad with their Kilroy Pizza? Serious combination! 
I'm like WHAT THE HELL??????? This is so good I can die today and be happy. 
As a chef for over 30 years who is picky-picky-picky - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place with their chef who brought amazing new items to their menu!
Don't ever let him - or your server Gabriel - go!!!!!
When I return, I'm definitely coming back!
And ... I gotta add ... the service is amazing. 
NO ONE IS LACKING IN THIS AREA!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a half of a wrap type sandwich with fries at PT's Brewing in North Las Vegas, NV on Friday, 3-24-17.  I shared the other half with a friend.  The wrap wasn't on the menu but the waitress offered to have this made into a wrap for us instead of how it was listed on the menu--as a sub with fries.  The wrap was filled with lots of crunchy lettuce and good meats and cheeses, as well as banana peppers.  The fries were served piping hot and the portion was what I'd call large.  Very good service.  We sat outside, in the shade, and because the weather was perfect, well, it was a really good lunch.  They made a fresh pot of coffee for us (much appreciated) and it was pretty good for restaurant coffee--a nice change.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place . Best place to stop by and have a drink or 2 while playing some poker ."}
{"text":"Must get the New Yorker sandwich. I'm from New York and they made this sandwich rite! Huge portion size and the flavor was epic. Make sure you try there local brews on tap as they are a micro Brewer. Best part is they are open 24/7 for beer and food!"}
{"text":"Every beer in the flight tasted as if it had been greatly watered down. 
Food was mediocre at best.
2 stars for good service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Sean Patricks Irish Red. Was a reddish Carmel color and was pretty tasty.

The Hualapi IPA had very citrusy floral taste.  One of my favorites at this brew pub.  

Did not try the food on this visit.  It seemed a little over priced but I will have go back and report my findings."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at this PT's location and Danny was the bartender and she done an amazing job my drink was always full and the machines are super hot! Me and my colleague were both playing Keno and one of uisneach of money on our lunch break! Oh yeah and did I mention Danny done a great job! Definitely a keeper for this bar"}
{"text":"It's rare that I feel the need to go online and give a bad review... but the staff here has been rude to me on more than one occasion for no reason whatsoever. I understand being busy during happy hour, but there's absolutely no need to be rude and dismissive. 

Tonight, I was exceptionally polite to the waitress who served us. I don't even feel like she made an effort to be polite in return. As a server, it's your job to bring water, condiments, beverages... don't make me feel like I'm burdening you when I ask you to do what you're getting paid for. 

There are a ton of beers on tap, and they're all pretty tasty, so you can't go wrong there. 

The food is unimpressive. 

5/7 wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Attempted to try out the new PTs. Sat down at a table....no machines left to play on. Settled at a table waited 20 minutes no service. A group of 3 sat down next to us and within a few minutes already had drinks. There were also plenty of servers available. Too bad wanted to try this new place out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good beer selection food was ok bartender was ok I just didn't  like the ambiance, too bright for a bar in my opinion, bad music, and the people there were kinda stuck up not my crowd probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I had been here a couple times for a late dinner when my dad was in the hospital & thought it was a decent place
Went there yesterday and totally different from what I thought. It was dirty and it smells in there...the water stunk like toilet water...
Won't be going back and note if you do try it go on the night shift otherwise you will wait FOREVER even for a hello much less a warm beer"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The service has been GREAT everytime. Food is AMAZING. The grilled cheese is to due for. The short rib dinner just as amazing. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Tried to go there for lunch today.  As you enter, the smell of cigarette smoke is overwhelming.  We went through the bar into the restaurant area hoping there would be less smoke there.  Still too strong.  No way to actually enjoy a meal if the strong smell of smoke bothers you."}
{"text":"This has become a weekly habit of mine. The beer is great! Love the wheat and Hefeweizen. I usually get the Cobb but I just had their \"special\" which was sliders with bacon mushrooms and blue cheese. Hope they make it a regular menu item because I'm a sucker for sliders. Also love that these bars have tots as an option for fries. 

Looks like they took pool tables and what not away to make room for a dining room. That being said, no pool tables or games of any kind. No jukebox. But nicer, more upscale version of PTs without all the smoke. Really like the layout but not sure if I would come here to hang out because of the lack of entertainment. Food and beer though are worth it.

Update: I came here recently and found they've added a few dishes they serve at regular PTs bars including their bikini wrap and pizzas. They got rid of some of the weirder dishes like ramen. I think this is a good move and I still enjoy getting lunch here."}
{"text":"This bar has amazing wait staff and bartenders but dont go there for food i went to watch the Golden Knights game and waited almost two hours for four potatoe skins and it wasnt just me the guys next to me waited nearly the entire game for their pizza it was ridiculous this place really needs a new kitchen manager ive worked in kitchens nearly 15 years and ive never seen such a shit show TWO HOURS FOR POTATOE SKINS!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me, I really loved this place when it first opened and I love their beers. The issue is it's so smoky and smells bad. The ventilation is very poor. Even if you come here when the place is dead, it's reminiscent of Nana's house back in the 80's. The food is usually hit or miss dependent on which chef is working. The bartenders, waiters/waitresses are all super nice and attentive. I get a lot of people like to relax and drink a beer/cocktail when smoking, but I think more people now days just dislike the smell and I would rather taste my food than that rancid air. Hopefully they will start selling their beers in bottles and kegs so I can avoid the smoke"}
{"text":"stopped for lunch on 7-21-17 (at noon)..... very few folks in the restaurant, which should have been an indication. Service was terminally SLOW. took almost 45 mins. to get lunch. Food was OK, but not anything noteworthy. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Food is good. I got the Asian style wings once and a house special pesto pasta another time. Beer is better. I've had a few, but the 9.1% ABV Double Durango IPA was actually damn good and really stood out. They allegedly brew it on site, but I didn't see any options to check out the facility (there is definitely the equipment there) so if you guys are reading this set up a tour with some tasting and I'm there. Yes, it's a PT's, but it has a significantly more upscale atmosphere. The food is not \"bucket of wings\" or \"questionable pizza\" but actually something I would take a date out to eat. Instead of a windowless box it feels open, has a sweet patio area, and is not full of your traditional bar accessories (pool tables, darts, etc). Great place for casual drinks."}
{"text":"went in there a few days ago and sat at a table i recieved some of the best service i have ever recieved at any restaurant from Kimberly. She was very attentive, gave me great suggestions on both food and drinks. i can not wait to go back and see her again. But i would love to have her take care of me while i am gaming."}
{"text":"Eh.  Plenty of better brews in town.  It is sort of out of the way in north Vegas and besides the great Happy Hour (half off 4-7pm) not much going for this place. It gives off a very similar vibe to the previous owner, Tenaya Creek's, digs Their own beer brand did not match my expectations from when I heard this brewery was opening.  The pale ale was soft, the stout a little watery, and the ale nothing to note.  The Wit was quite refreshing, however, so I would have liked to try their saison as well which was out when I went.  Their IPA had a nice bitterness but a bad aftertaste.  The food was also too overpriced.  Overall, there's better breweries in town if you're looking for local brands."}
{"text":"Name of business should be pt's brewing company 1st of all. They have only been open for a week. Have to say the atmosphere was pretty cool. Very different from a regular PT's pub or Sierra gold. Lots of beers on tap. Also they will they will be brewing their own batch of PT's beers. Most of those were not available yet. Menu was very different from PT's. Prices were a little extreme $15 for a grilled cheese? Hamburger was only $10 I'm not sure why the prices were so crazy. Staff was friendly and attentive I will go back but probably only for happy hour prices and not the food prices."}
{"text":"Great food and beer close to home I had the new Yorker and the wife had the spinach Quinoa salad loved it will be back"}
{"text":"Well pts happy hour just became worst than a 99 cent tostitos pizza. They used to have awesome pizzas. A little pricey  but dam they were great. Happy hour had them at half price. The new crust is like a hard flat stiff piece of hardboard. I ate  a few bites and left it. Sorry to see the food quality go from a 10 to a 2.  Would not recommend eating here anymore. Staff is excellent,  beers very cold, awesome place to watch sports. But worst pizza , save your money, frozen store bought   even has them beat ."}
{"text":"This place was great. The beer was good, didn't attached to a specific one- did a flight of six. My favs were the coffee stout and apricot sour. Food was great. Will definitely go back. Just hoping for a stronger double IPA next time."}
{"text":"I've tried beer & food from 5-6 local breweries in Vegas. As a Portland craft beer snob, this place had the most balanced and delicious beer hands down. The pretzel was fantastic and service is top notch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"got lucky enough to sit in Kim's section. best service i've had there. she was great"}
{"text":"We put over $300 in the machine and he didn't comp our $10 pizza?? What the hell, plus he didn't know what the progressive was. Come on dude, instead of talking about EDC the whole time with two people learn to pay more attention behind the bar. ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with PT's happy hour if you just want to be in a chill environment with friends and enjoy a couple of drinks-- or PLENTY of drinks during happy hour because their happy hour is the bomb!!!! Lol.

Giving this specific location 3 stars because I came here with my sister, brother, and boyfriend for some drinks to ring in my sisters birthday. The drinks of course never fails me which it always a plus. BUT when I checked my bank statement the next morning I realized my card was charged for TWO transactions -- one that I authorized and the second I did not authorize. It's not like my card was accidentally ran twice on my bill either because it was 2 completely different amounts and it wasn't even busy at this location at this time for a mistake like this to happen. I called them to let them know as soon as I noticed but management wasn't in at the moment therefore I just disputed it with my bank directly to avoid having to wait any longer.

Definitely not a 4-5 star rating for the inconvenience I had to go through. But 3 stars for the drinks, bar food, and the fact that even though this honest mistake occurred the workers were all nice."}
{"text":"So pretty much our go to spot after a long ass 12 hour night at the hospital for a well deserved drink and food. Typically I go for the breakfast burrito, which you can't go wrong with, ever but this time got the steak and eggs and I gotta say, it wasn't bad at all. And to makes things better, they have Kona Big Wave on tap so that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Bar area staff was nice and courteous. Then we decided to sit at the table to have some food during happy hour. We waited, waited, waited...waitress ignored us the whole time. She brought waters to a table behind us, and checked in on a table in front us. For us, we were left alone for 15 minutes. We just got up and left, it was the worst experience I've ever had with service."}
{"text":"Best microbrews I've tried in Vegas easily! Great food and service too. I'll be back. Try the pretzel and Irish nut beer!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite place to meet as he is getting off work! The staff is fantastic and always remembers us, our drink preferences and the manager always drops by the table to say hello.
Today we had our favorite appetizer, the Brew Brussels, and as usual they were wonderful. I had the Ramen Noodle Bowl with pork belly, and the hubby had the Cheesy Sliders. Best food, cold brews and friendly staff, you can't ask for better!"}
{"text":"Good staff here and thy make you feel welcome. Always cheery and the food is good quality. Excellent brew selection on tap as well. Good service and well located to places nearby out-of-towners would find easy."}
{"text":"Great location, decor, ambiance and beer choices.
We were there on a Saturday night. 
It was too bright in the bar area; felt like they were cleaning up/closing.

Another problem we ran into was with service: the bartender was friendly, but spent most of her time at the register, apparently looking at her phone. There were people waiting to be served. Our beers had been empty before we were offered more. We decided to cash out and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Opening up this coming Wednesday. Great staff. Really pumped for the opening. Good selection of food and beer. Highly recommended.

They are trying to take the food and beer quality up beyond the typical brewpub. 

Shrimp and grits? Check? More traditional? Awesome burgers. And did I mention tater tots? What can go wrong.

Really glad to see PT's over in this area. The former brewery was good but too limited in terms of selection.

The staff is really top notch. Ebru at the bar is the best. Friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week today i come in today 4:15pm and the young lady working at the bar was very rude to me. I worked all day its not pt's the food is great im going to tip the cook more than the rude one at the bar next time see her i will get a table."}
{"text":"Not at all what I was expecting for a bar, we were pleasantly surprised! The decor was nice, modern and clean. Service was a bit slow, the waiter took too long to bring my drink out and a double looked liked a single. My suggestion would be to use a smaller class instead..it's about perception. I ordered their chicken Greek salad, very fresh, chicken had a nice  flavor to it and the portion was attractive."}
{"text":"Horrible service and was charged $5.75 for soda water with dry limes instead of vodka soda. When I didn't drink my it, I wasn't asked if everything was ok. Horrible customer service very rude."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and I must say I am very impressed with the changes they have made! They have an excellent specialty drink menu. You must try their version of a Moscow mule, it's the bomb. They also have a menu that has upscale food, a better selection than just a bar menu. I tried their grilled cheese and the giant pretzel with beer cheese sauce, both of them were very delicious. The only complaint I would have is that their food prices are a little high for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"Josette and Kim are amazing. I have been displaced due to travel and have tried several places. It wasn't until I met this duo that I decided to leave this as my travel go to place. They are amazing. I can't recommend this enough!"}
{"text":"The place seemed dead, but somehow the server couldn't attend to us much.  The beer was great, the wings were very good, but I can't speak to the pot stickers that I ordered and didn't get.  I'd give them another chance in the future."}
{"text":"Wish i could tell you how good this place was. My wife and i sat there for 10 minutes and a server and busser walked right by us. Sat another 5 and then left to Aces and Ales."}
{"text":"This use to be Tenaya Creek. They upgraded a whole lot. I really enjoyed the new upgrade. The drink tried was pretty good and the bartenders were friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great prices. Joe is amazing. Best bartender I've had in a long time. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Stop in after work the girl bartender is completely rude! Ask her what's on tap she points and says it up there(on the wall) wasn't walks away. Then out of everyone sitting asks me to get up for someone to gamble (I know the bar is for the gamblers). But there was others around me not gambling. Will not be returning to this place"}
{"text":"Just left after a truly disappointing lunch here.  First, there are only bar height tables, not a deal breaker but there was one tiny tanle stuck behind a pillar so we sat there.  Hubby ordered a pulled pork sandwiche and I had a club.  The food came out and hubby took a bite of his sandwich and nearly gagged!  He asked me to taste the pork...it was totally spoiled and rancid!!!  We notified the server who asked if he wanted something else and apologized.  He ordered a burger (they have a 24 hour special for $7.99).  The burger came out and was OK.  When we got the bill, he was charged $11.00 plus $1.00 for the slice of cheese!  In top of everything else, the bar and the restaurant aren't separated and people were smoking at the bar so it smelled inside.  We were so disgusted that we just paid the bill and left.  It might have helped if management would have spoken to us, but CLEARLY, they don't care.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"So this place is okay. One thing they have going for them: awesome bartenders.

There seems to be a weird vibe here. Maybe because it's a bar and people are drunk. But it's crazy mellow. Last night, there was a wasted couple that we're having a heart to heart. The guy started crying. It was super awkward. And of course, they drove home. 

The food here is not that great. We've had:

 The fingerling potatoes - super weird. It's boiled potatoes with a sour cream dip. 
The Brew House burger. The bun was good, but the meat did not taste like Kobe. It was well done when I asked for medium. 
Shrimp curry - the curry was good. But they use minute made rice, which completely fucks up the whole dish. You have to serve basmati or jasmine rice with curry. Seriously. It makes the dish what it is. That or serve it with no rice. But they pile the curry on top of the pre cooked horrible rice. 

Overall, I'm not impressed. PT's brews aren't that great. You're better off sticking with different brews or liquor.

The renovation does look great. And again, the bartenders are really awesome. Very nice, tentative and make it a better place. Just hoped for a better outcome of everything."}
{"text":"4 stars for their beer and excellent service! The bf and I had just finished hiking and wanted a nice cold beer - Yelped and found PT's. Pretty quiet on a Saturday afternoon, maybe about 10 other people enjoying beers and TV. We tried a few beers before ordering and we really enjoyed their Wit and Ale. Price point was great as well! Only $5/pint for the beers we chose. 

Super friendly and attentive service, place has a ton of TVs and a nice outdoor patio area to enjoy your beer. Pretty good variety on the food menu as well. Good place to relax and grab a beer in the afternoon :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on within the brewery at PT's.  Former manager Joey was awesome from bet #1 then he leaves for another store. 
Then we had Susan who was every bit as friendly as Joey and even more personable. Now she is gone  There has been questionable food production over the last couple visits as well.
Now we have Jeremy. I want to give him a chance but in my humble dollar driven opinion, he has stumbled out of the gate.
My wife and I went in last night as it has become on of our regular spots. 
This is when we find out the changes. Ok we can work with this. Sure he is personable and quick to get our beverage and food order.
We play a couple 20's each.... I get two Miller Lite's (yeah I know we are at a brewery) my wife gets a couple Jamison and Gingers. We order a sandwich with fries to split all is good.
Well until I wanted ketchup.....no follow up until we are 90% finished and who cares about condiments at this point.  
Now we ask for the bill and get the bill. 
What, not even a comped bottle if Miller Lite?
Really?  
Now don't get me wrong. I will happily pay. We usually get one drink comped for every 20 we bet. 
Looks like Ace's and Ales and Big Dog's move up in the batting order and PT's is gonna get benched for a while. This is ok as the beer selection has been missing the mark lately anyhow. 
Follow up likely in a monthish"}
{"text":"Alright, so if you plan on going to the bar, you'll have a fantastic time. Service is great. It's the waitresses that are horrible. We had a HUGE party come in ready to drop money on food and booze and the waitresses were nothing but rude. Rude enough to make 10 grown men want to leave and go to a different PTs down the road on lake mead. 

We didn't even have a chance to be rude to cause these waitresses to be bitches. They were rude right from the start. I feel bad for the bar tenders because they lost out on some serious cash"}
{"text":"Want to counterbalance some of the comments about service.  I sat at the bar last night and the bartenders were both friendly and efficient.  I had the nightly salmon special and they went out of their way to make tartar sauce and it was very tasty.

The new place has a nice vibe and the bar stools are comfy.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was a teneya regular but must say, the revamping is amazing! Food is great and I do love how they have some better beers on tap.  My only real issue and why I won't give this a 5 star is the service.   I sat in the dinning room a week ago and it took FOREVER for our waiter Christian to check on us, we had to order the same drink twice before he actually brought it to us.
Last night I sat at the bar, it took too long to order a simple beer.  Even longer to order food, food is great though.
All in all k do love this place and hope that with time the service improves.  The bartenders and waiters need to realize they are there to do a job but they seem more interested in watching TV or talking to each other."}
{"text":"Weird Vibes. One of the female bartenders I've encountered isn't too friendly. It's a convenient location but I'd much rather take my happy ass to Aces and Ales down the street. I want to like this bar but I feel awkward sitting in front of a judgy bartender. Decent Beer."}
{"text":"The brewery is fantastic if you are into craft beers this place is for you! Not your regular bar food! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Sad clean place.  Like alwaya the bartender fu,,k the place....  Is like he is doing you a favor of direct a word to you"}
{"text":"The house pinot griogio is Amazing and their Gilroy pizza for happy hour tastey. I made the mistake of going to a different location near work and was sorely disappointed with the pizza ans Greek salad. I will only come to this location from now on! The chef, service and bartender rocks here"}
{"text":"Saw the sign about food & brew...so glad we did. Great staff, great food, and superb beer! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In response to  the \"Vidal C\" review, I call BS.  I was there last night and had the pleasure of being served by those waitresses you trashed.  In my experience, they've always been kind, courteous, fun, and consistently provide great service. Actually, they're one of the main reasons we come here. 

I saw your group of ten come into the bar and find it amazing that you formed your opinion of waitresses you didn't even interact with. 

If you're going to make the effort to write a review, at least make an attempt to make it accurate, or else, you're doing a massive disservice to these hard working girls, potential customers, and the Yelp community at large."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice , I normally go to Ace's and Ales but I decided to try this new Bar. The bartenders were not very friendly they were your basic hello how are you but almost treated my friend and I as if we wouldn't be spending money . We ordered 4 drinks and shared a plate and to get a new drink we had to flag someone down. 
I will give this place a second try but it will most likely be for happy hour"}
{"text":"This place popped up on my radar after I was astounded to find Tenaya on Bonanza in its new home.
 Nothing wrong with it, but nothing stands out, either. 
 The interior facelift is nice, food menu is intriguing and selection of beer is extensive- nothing you can't find elsewhere. I was disappointed that the house brew didn't include hef, only wit. Light and refreshing, but I like cloudy yeasties and will remain loyal to Tenaya for that. 
 We ordered calimari, which again, was neither good nor bad, but I did think considering the venue food should be priced about 15-20% less. 
 The place had a lively atmosphere on Friday at midnight and had one energetic and incredibly efficient bar tender with a flower in her hair working the bar. She finally got some reinforcements, but even alone, she didn't miss a beat.
 Thankfully it had nothing of a seedy vibes at some PTs, I felt safe and comfortable. 
 That's really about it. Check it out if you must, but I won't be making it my go to spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing time!!  My server, Kim was all smiles and high-spirited.  She even sang some 90's hits with me.  Good times.  

As for the bartenders, Christian is the man.  The drinks were on point and on time.  Very professional and very courteous.  That's not to take away from Joe either.  Joe was comical from the start and still professional.  Lots of laughs.  

Lastly, my favorite...the food.  I don't know who the heck they have in the kitchen, but whoever it is deserves a raise.  From something as simple as pizza or grilled cheese to more quality dishes like the salmon or steak...everything was amazing.  Gourmet-quality food.  I'd choose this place over most restaurants.  All-in-all, I'm more than pleased.  Definitely will visit more and refer this location to friends and family."}
{"text":"We were in on Saturday, the day after the grand opening. Fabulous day, so soaking up the sun on the patio - great setting. Gabriel was fun and informative, if a little busy. 

Three flights and a Rum Bull later, our party was very impressed with the drink service. Great sizes on the tasters, and of course phenomenal beer. 

The food was AMAZING - everyone was impressed with the choices they made. For the record - dirty jambalaya, fried chicken sandwiches, and the New Yorker. Great attention to detail and all done very well. 

We thought we were done, but the Skillet Cooke is not to be missed. We shared it between 4 of us, and there was plenty to go around.

This is a trip across the Valley for those of us in Henderson, but is a  pilgrimage we will gladly make!"}
{"text":"Pt's and Sierra Gold went from having the best Happy Hour to the Worst Happy Hour!!! If you want a micro brew on tap, they now make you order one of their nasty ass PT beers! The most disgusting beer in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great beer and food in a nice sports bar w/great tvs.  Service is good by bearded guys.  I like the Brussel sprouts, pea soup, pork and beans and pizza.  Restaurant for a bar is outstanding.  Variety of draft and bottled beers is top notch.  I will be back for gourmet poor food dishes.  Good bar too w/nice cocktail menu."}
{"text":"Was there about a week or so ago and ran in to Dave, the brewmaster.   He is still brewing great creations at PT's if you remember him from Big Dog's.   Had his Dave's Double IPA, it's a very good double.   Also, his west coast IPA is still on the mark.   Wifey had the Sean Patrick Irish which was also really good.   It's a pretty chill place and the staff there is very friendly."}
{"text":"Since they have some brews that can only be enjoyed at this location, I went to check it out for the first time on a Tuesday. I hadn't been here since Tenaya left, so that was many years ago! 
The bar was pretty tame and the bartender was friendly. I had looked at the draft choices online so I'd be prepared. I requested the brew with mango and guava, as listed for this location. He offered me the Sahara Pale Ale, which as it turns out wasn't the one with mango and guava (Festival Pale Ale). I did ask for the Festival after consulting the draft board. They had quite the variety going for draft beer here, a good reason to return! 

The decor is more polished, with some neat-o beer related art and a more modern feel to the place than it used to have. The bar area (with video poker) is nice and there are plenty of tables near the bar and in the adjacent dining room. Half price pizza at happy hour is popular, and they have other deals for football games also. A patio area is available, and I would likely take advantage of that next time!"}
{"text":"Love PTs happy hour. Glad they started brewing, added the brew master from Big Dogs, nice catch there. Friendly service, dedicated staff.

Ordered a flight of all their Brews. The 2 ales were awesome, very crisp and light for ales. The wheat....um....um...bubble gum flavor was the best way to describe it...redo..
Red and stouts were bang on.. The IPA was close to being great..balance off a bit from the citrus accent...but I'm glad they made it... a little more work and look out ballast point!

Of course the Gilroy pizza is one of the best in town..happy hour $10!!!

Improved the inside of Tenaya Creek, big screens everywhere with something to watch for everyone.
Good job PT'S !!"}
