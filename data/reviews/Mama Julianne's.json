{"text":"Great fricking place!!!  Local, not a chain, and your pizza is cooked by true pazinozs...Seinfeld...thanks guys!!   Try the breadsticks with cheese...they rock and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a local pizza place, found these guys on google. I believe they were once pjays. Unsure. But saw the Meat Monster pizza advertised and had to do it. The pizza had ham, pepperoni, bacon, sausage and meatballs. Delicious. I enjoy small pizza shops and this one did a good job. First time trying them and I'm happy. Will definently try again. Overall prices seemed pretty reasonable for a small pizza shop. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Best pizza in my area.  It's always our go to when we have family over and need a quick meal.  Their prices for half and full sheet pizzas are really good.  The quality of the pizza is excellent.  The owner works in the shop, answers the phone, etc.  The only knock against them is that their delivery time (45-60 min) is a little long, but I just order earlier, and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We wanted to patronize a local pizza shop and ordered a large 3 item pizza from this local business it seems that unless you order extra sauce on pizza,you get very very little sauce. Very disappointing especially when it cost 15.00.We will try other local businesses not this one again. Not sure why pizza shops skimp on the sauce..hint hint ADD THE SAUCE"}
{"text":"Every Friday evening for the past 8 years, my husband and I have enjoyed Mama Julianne's food!  For the salads, the lettuce is always freshly washed, and made to order.  The pizza is perfect, great sauce and crust, never greasy or soggy.  The lasagna and pastas are also delicious, and the sauce is not too spicy or acidic.  The sauce seems to have a hint of sugar in the recipe, which we love.  The chicken tenders are lite and tasty, very good, as well as the cole slaw.  The dinner rolls are wonderful too.   We usually call ahead and pickup the order ourselves, with no bad experiences.  Mama's crew is friendly and efficient, and they work well together.  We would definitely recommend Mama Julianne's to anyone! :)  Sue & Chris Kish Columbia Station, OH"}
{"text":"New to this side of town and love this pizza. Favorites so far... Sicilian and Meat Monster."}
{"text":"Yes they have pizza.  This is actually a place formerly known as PJay's Pizza.  The sauce is very light (not seasoned very much)  The toppings are usually pretty generous, but cheese is rationed.  There is no decernable difference between regular and extra cheese.  The crust is fresh but again not really flavored. They have awesome stromboli.  While this is made with the same ingridents it has some weird interaction in the oven, or its the extra sauce to put over it.  The place has some good deals for two pizzas, and has lunch specials.  This is an average pizza place for area, better than a chain."}
{"text":"Third time we ordered from here, and I am not sure what happened. I thought subs were supposed to have lettuce and tomato, they didn't they need to ask that question instead of customers guessing or hoping to get them on their subs. also the boneless chicken was all burnt never has happened before, I guess we will try one more time since the last two times were really great!."}
{"text":"Needed to pick up pizza and jojo's for a New Year's Eve party and it was a challenge to find a pizza shop that has jojo's on the menu. That's how we came across Mama Julianne's. Ordered 2 half sheet pizzas and an order of jojo's. Everybody complimented how good the pizza and the sauce was. Workers were super friendly and service was quick when i came for the carry out order. Would definitely recommend this pizza shop and will return if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Lasagna is great, rigatoni and meatballs are great, pizza is delicious. If you want your wings hot, she has HOT!!!! I LOVE Mama Julianne!!!!"}
{"text":"I ended up getting a free pizza from here as a new to Strongsville coupon which was really cool. I ended up upgrading it to the large but it was a great deal none the less. Unfortunately the pizza itself was not that great and just kind of bland."}
{"text":"Come on, people! I love this place! Recently, Mama Julienne's sponsored a fundraiser for my kids' school - they are good people, with a great, extensive menu, and very good food. The fried chicken and stromboli were new tries for my family, and big hits! The traditional Italian dinner fare are also quite delicious. I love lasagna, and Mama Julianne does not disappoint. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their homemade salad dressing - it is really good! You can't beat their specials. So, move out of your comfort zone a little, folks - you'll be very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good....but the wings are freaking awesome!  20 bucks for a large pie and 12 wings on Thursdays!  I always do takeout and hit the bar next for for a quick beer while the Mama and  Co do their thing."}
{"text":"This pizza joint was formally known as PJ's pizza, and while still under same ownership from before I don't understand why the pizza changed so much! Mama Julianne's pizza is not as cheesy as I would like and the crust is tasteless! I expected better from this place since we used to be regulars at PJ's. Minus another star for the price, definitely too expensive compared to the other pizza places around."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza ,  absolutely nasty staff. We ordered pizzas for a party. Prior to delivery we added more to the order. The rude , clearly annoyed order taker was  insulting, condescending, and clueless. She refused to even take the order claiming unless we gave her the credit card  first she would not even write the order up. The large order had already been paid for earlier in the day.  This was merely adding another pizza to that order. I tried to explain we were adding bc other people arrived  we weren't expecting to which she replied. Quit talking and I'll get your order, right??   When tbe driver arrived 15 minutes late. We tipped him 25%  he tossed the food on the table took the tip and walked out. No thank you  nothing.  Theres so much better from businesses that appreciate you. Skip this place  its a loser"}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago when an older gentleman working in the back dropped a piece of pizza on the floor.  He scoopws it up the pizza spatula, dump it in the trash, then use the same spatula to remove a pizza from oven.  Hilarious and gross at the same time.  Didn't stop me from ordering a couple slices for lunch.  Pizza is great, not the cleanest."}
{"text":"I have done both carry out and delivery with success. Having tried 5 different pizzas here so far, I really love the 'white' pizza offerings. Recently we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and there were arguments over who would get the last piece."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around!!  Not only is all the food good the staff and owner is awesome!  I love it!!!"}
