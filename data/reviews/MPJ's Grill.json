{"text":"We were back out in Fountain Hills yesterday to drop off some jewelry at Style With A Twist, a fun ladies clothing and accessory boutique. Our friend Candy, the owner, enthusiastically told us about a new restaurant that she thought we'd like. She was especially happy because it was one we hadn't yet heard about. It's called MPJ's Grill and Restaurant, and it turns out to be catty-corner from Phil's (see below). We had, in fact, driven right by without noticing it when we ate there last week.  The chef/owner who used to work at Phil's has put together a nice menu, much smaller and slightly more upscale but with comparable prices. There are 7 starters including crab cakes and seared tuna, each $7, two quesadillas, and a shrimp and avocado tower ($7). We shared a cup of corn chowder (a steal at $2), loaded with fresh corn kernels and subtly spiced. Since we were both very hungry we skipped the salads and sandwich portion of the menu and settled on meat - NY strip steak ($14) for me, with blackened spices and blue cheese. Ken ordered the marinated  center cut pork chops with melted gorgonzola ($11) which Candy had raved about. Each came with a side salad and choice of potato - mashed, rosemary roasted or fries - or rice. No veggies.   The salad was disappointing. It was clearly made from bagged lettuce blend, and none too fresh. A few chopped tomatoes and cukes had been added. The thousand island dressing was quite good (it tasted very much like Phil's), the blue cheese dressing was mediocre. We perked up when our entrees arrived. My steak was quite large, and spread with a melty blue cheese/cream cheese mixture. It was cooked medium rare as I had requested, and was tender and not fatty. The pork chops were the real hit. They were juicy as could be, flavorful, and well served by their blue cheese topping. Our rosemary potatoes were good too, although I would have liked them to be a little crisper on the outside. The one jarring note was the clump of lettuce mixture used to garnish the plate - it was useless, messy and certainly didn't add to the presentation. That aside, we were very happy with our choices, particularly for the price.  MPJ's has only been open since the end of June, but they have quite a following. We had arrived at 5 PM, and by 6 PM there were people waiting for tables. I hope that both this place and Phil's will each survive the competition. Once they get a liquor license MPJ's will likely be even more popular. They're already expanding into the next store front. In the meantime, the decor is nonexistent. And the bathroom is outside around the corner. Their website stresses the notion that this is a \"fine dining\" restaurant, and shows a very misleading photo. But really, this is just a place to come to get a good solid meal at a remarkably good price.  So, let me finish telling you about the menu. There are 8 main- dish salads, most around $8. In the sandwich department there are 6 different burgers ($7 and $8) and they looked really delicious. Paninis, club sandwiches, and wraps round out this category. And finally, there are 8 pastas, from $10 to $13. Sugar spiced salmon with creamy spinach pasta and Romano cheese tempted me. The desserts sounded \"corporate\", cheesecake, tiramisu and chocolate cake. We didn't try any."}
{"text":"I went to this place with friends  on Sunday, and basically, there was nothing really good or bad about the place, just meh. We were a party of eight, so they had to cobble together some tables to fit us all in. Other than ourselves there were another three people eating there. The atmosphere was particularly bland, nothing really special or unique about the place. The menu is quite diverse, but really no more than simple diner cuisine. The service was ok, the food was presented well. I had a smoked bacon burger, which was nothing special. Prices were ok ($8.50 for my burger which came with fries, plus another $2.50 for Iced Tea).   So, all in all, this place is nothing to write home about, but isn't a place I'd stay away from."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. The food quality and service was always good. Too bad the place is now closed."}
{"text":"MPJ Grill is a family owned restaurant in Fountain Hills and by far this families personal favorite.  From the moment you walk in the door you see smiling faces and caring people.  The owner is always there and truly cares about every piece of his business.  The food is beyond fabulous with so many options.....everything from the best fish and chips we have ever had (Friday/Saturday) to amazing lamp chops (Wednesday) to burgers, pasta and outrageous pork chops.  There are even vegetarian options which are wonderful as well!  Having lived here for over a year this is the one place that is consistent in food quality and we are there weekly.  You can not go wrong.  Any negatives about this place are totally unfounded, it is excellent, clean, friendly and just perfect."}
{"text":"Had dinner here about 2 weeks ago and thought the meal, service and ambiance was nice. Kinda basic, which is on par for FH, but very clean & comfortable.  The staff made us feel welcome even though we were the only ones in there and they basically had to work for only us.  But the main reason for going there is the food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I had the Talapia entree and my husband had the sausage pasta. Both dishes were excellent. We had the chocolate mousse pie for dessert which was also excellent. The ambiance needs a little work to catch up with the quality of the food but I am sure that will come in time. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner."}
