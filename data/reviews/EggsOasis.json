{"text":"A great place for breakfast.  Went for the first time today, and had the eggs, potatoes, bacon, fruit.  Nothing was greasy, the bacon had a nice hickory flavour, the potatoes were cut like thick chips, and the fruit slices were fresh.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday morning, having just partied the night before so we were all hungover and in need of bacon! It was fantastic food! Service was great as well. The menu has a really big variety to choose from so we all took a long time to finally pick what we wanted. The menu is also hilarious because of the certain words they use to describe the amount of food you'll be getting, ie. \"Myriads of fruit!\" haha they have a few other ones that are pretty funny as well. 

The only complaint I have about this place is that it's a little over priced. I had orange juice and Eggs Benedict and my bill was a little over 20$ so don't go expecting Denny's prices. Other than that, excellent breakfast and service. Would go back for sure"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. It was not super-packed busy but there were people there. 

Service Review:

The waitress seemed indifferent of us being there. She put our drinks and food plates on the table next to us instead of just walking around to where we were sitting to put the plates in front of us. Very weird. She even set our coffees at the end of the adjacent table as she \"dropped them off\" at the table. I have never seen a waitress not set my food/drink in front of me before. 

Food Review:

The food was absolutely DISGUSTING. We ordered the Florentine Benedict and the Beefsteak Benedict. 

First off, the Florentine Benedict was made with frozen shredded spinach heated up over the cooktop. It stank and was smothered in cheese. It was the most un-fresh food I have ever tasted. Just to get an idea of the food quality, I ate the benedict without the sauce. I could not eat more than two bites. We informed the waitress that the $14 benedict was inedible and she shrugged and charged us for it anyway. My boyfriend ordered the Beefsteak Benedict. The meat tasted like rancid horse meat. The eggs were poached with too much vinegar so that you could actually taste the vinegar on the eggs. A big NO-NO for good poached eggs. Neither of us ate our meals. Our bill was about $30 for the two sub-par inedible breakfast plates.

We left hungry.

Denny's would have tasted like a 5-star restaurant after this disgusting meal. Overpriced. HORRIBLE QUALITY. You can spend $30 for two people at MUCH nicer restaurants for breakfast in Calgary.

Do everyone a favor, EggsOasis, and close your doors!"}
{"text":"Don't go for the coffee it's horrible. The food is below average of most breaky places. I feel like they want to be Cora's but just don't cut it. Whenever I drive by I get cravings for crepes but then I go in and I it all tastes blah and the ingredients don't seem fresh. Service is great so they get the second star. I also feel like it is pretty expensive if you just want some eggs and toast about $12. I do however like to go here with kids...they don't care about coffee and like the chocolate so I can chat with a friend. 
Oh and their chocolate sauce tastes like it was squeezed out of a bottle..."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 12 pm. Not very busy but had painfully slow service. Server was nice but not attentive. Food was below average for taste and freshness. Good value for a sub par meal and service since we didn't feel like cooking. Thankfully we had not stopped in expecting much and that is exactly what we got."}
{"text":"I wouldn't describe the food at Eggs Oasis bad, but the breakfast I had here was completely unremarkable. The eggs benedict I had was the culinary equivalent of water - a competently neutral flavour, albeit smothered in too much mediocre hollandaise. 
The service was extremely fast, though I don't think the waitress came by one between dropping off our food and bringing the bill. 
If you're desperate for breakfast and for some reason can't get to Cora's or Ricky's, you probably won't have a bad experience. There's just no reason to come here with other, better breakfast joints nearby."}
{"text":"We just moved to Airdrie and needed to find a breakfast place as it is my favorite meal of the day. We were leery to go to Eggs Oasis because we had never heard of it (coming from BC). 
We were very happy! It was new, clean, friendly and tons to choose from. We've had plain ol' eggs and toast which was great... Eggs done the way I like them and the sausage was really good too. Spinach and cheese omelette which was terrific - the cheese was so tasty. Spinach and cheese crepe - this one blew me away. It was so good. 
The waitresses are very attentive and personable. 
Over all we're very happy we found our new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"My go to breakfast spot when in Calgary.
The Country Hills location has tons of parking, fast service, and the Hunter's Omelette will keep you going for days. (Well, til lunch time at least)"}
{"text":"Despite the hype it was just an ok experience.

Had the vegetarian Omelete and it needed seasoning, the homestyle potatoes were hot but just ok as compared to others \"homestyle potatos\"
Waitress was friendly enough to get a tip but did not bring additional carafe of coffee, when asked to pull the blinds down due to the sun reflecting off a windshield she said ok, then proceeded to clean and clear tables and checkin with other tables and left for the kitchen without addressing our concern.
The lack of non-meat options unless you want a juice or smoothie was disappointing.
Could not locate pancakes on the menu, waffles are close but i have a hard time paying $12 for a single waffle.
The coffee was ok"}
{"text":"I've had bad and good experience. 2 times I came in at 230 and I stood there waiting to be seated but servers did not care to sit me or even say anything to me so I went and sat  and maybe hope I will get a manu or something but no so I just walked out. Every time I came before 2 they were all welcome. I don't care if your shift is close to end of the day, the sign says your open till 3 not 2. The food is good but service is just as important as food. So ya never again"}
{"text":"Oh my God, I love this place!

My wife and I went here for the first time a few weeks ago on a recommendation from a friend. 
My wife ordered the omelet, and thought it was quite good.  She also liked the addition of fresh fruit on the plate, as well as the uh.. hashbrowns?  Potato chip fries?  I don't actually know what to call them, but I thought they were a nice change from the usual clump of shredded or chunked potato you get everywhere else.

On to my favorite part:  The crepes!
This is the one menu item that intrigued me, as:
1. I love crepes.
2. I haven't had crepes in years, because I suck at making them, and most places don't offer them.

I ordered the strawberry crepe.  What I received was a giant crepe, crammed full of cream and strawberries, with some fresh watermelon on the side.
Long story short, the entire time I was eating, I felt more like I was having desert than breakfast, but I didn't care because it was so good.

All in all, I enjoyed the food, the service was decent, and I plan to mix this place into my breakfast choices in the future."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast!  Our server was very friendly and went over all the specials in great detail. We had breakfast poutine was fries, egg, sausage cheese curds and gravy side of fruit slices. As well as the early bird special of 2 eggs home style potatoes, bacon with fruit and a side of toast as well as a thermos of coffee. 
Food service was fast considering the place was very busy.  From the time of ordering to the time the food came to the table was about 15 minutes. Didn't even have time to finish reading the morning newspaper. LOL
The food was hot which was a great surprise. 

About the parking. 
There is no problem with parking here. There is abundance of parking stalls to choose from. 

Hours of operation: 
Monday - Saturday 6 am to 3 pm
Sunday 7 am - 3 pm

Free Wifi 

Well worth the stop for breakfasts or lunch you won't leave hungry. 

The price for our breakfast for 2 people was about $21.85."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and I've never been disappointed by the service or the food. Personally, I love the fact that they serve cretons and buckwheat crepes, plus other not so easy to find delights. Plus, their kid's menu has great value and selection. My little one loves the banana chocolate crepe as a special breakfast treat.

For a busy place that is usually wall-to-wall on Sundays, I have to say that they have certainly trained their staff right! They are aware and listening to their patrons, making sure that every little detail is right, even at a table of nine where there are five children!

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Been a few times for breakfast on the weekends. Always quick service, fresh and affordable entree's. They have a great menu with lots of variety and a perfect place to go with the family that wont break the bank. Will be back again! !!!"}
{"text":"This place never fails. Good service. Large portion, great tasting food. Reasonable priced. All around great place. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant to try this place, as it has absolutely zero curb appeal, and hadn't heard anything too exciting about it. Airdrie doesn't have a lot of breakfast places, so we thought we would check this new-ish one out. 
It is way nicer inside than I was expecting, lots of tables and very clean. The menu is huge, with a bit of everything, about 5 different Benedicts, crepes, waffles, omelettes, and lots of combos. 
I went with a combo plate that had a crepe with blueberries and cream, bacon,sausage, eggs and hash browns(?). Oh! And toast!  It literally had everything, so you can get a huge meal without having to order anything on the side. I did leave a lot of it uneaten, but at least I got to try a bit of everything. 
The hash browns are these deep fried potato discs. Not bad, but could only eat a few. The crepes are nice and thin, like crepes should be, not like the big fat dry ones at Cora's that are more like pancakes. The blueberries and cream inside was a delicious touch. Should have asked for my bacon crispy, it was a little wobbly for my liking, but each to their own. The fruit garnish on the side was a little sad looking, but everything else was really good.
Another nice thing about this place is they leave a carafe of coffee on your table, so you don't have to wait for the waitress to come around. 
Overall, we were quite impressed with this place, and it will most likely be our go to brekkie place in Airdrie now. Sorry Cora's, your chubby crepes and jet fuel coffee have been replaced!"}
{"text":"This is one of the rare restaurants we will never go back to.

It started out iffy, the wait to sit down was almost 10 minutes in a restaurant that was only half-full, and our order was taken around 10 minutes after that.  D ordered the Brie Cheese and Ham benny with the Royal Blend fruit juice, and I ordered the Oasis Ambrosia, also with the Royal Blend fruit juice.

Now most breakfasts are cooked relatively quickly, especially in a restaurant that specializes in that style.  An agonizingly long 35 minutes later we had our food and yet no drinks.  I asked the server who brought us our food where our drinks were.  Now, 10-15 minutes prior to being served our food our drinks were put up at the pass but they were not brought to our table until I asked where they were.  That is an unnecessarily long wait for drinks and to find out it was the pair that were sitting directly within my line of sight was upsetting to say the least.

For the food:
-The oasis ambrosia was decent, lots of cream and fresh fruit, however the french toast was flavourless and almost uncooked.

-The royal blend was so thick it was difficult to drink, not typical of fresh fruit juice, and mostly consisted of seeds (we found out why afterwards).

-The benny had no brie, or if it did it was so well hidden D couldn't find it, and the whole plate came cold.  The potatoes that came with it were under cooked, not seasoned, and had a taste similar to styrofoam (which I tried as well so the description is definitely accurate).  His fruit was not very fresh, the eggs were cooked okay, and the hollandaise was bland and cold.

When we got the bill it had an upcharge on our juices for 'smoothie.'  We never ever ordered them as smoothies, preferring freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, which turned out to be why they were almost undrinkably thick.

The biggest joke here was that it was passed off by management as 'trainee server,' however even a newbie server cannot also be responsible for the terrible food that came from the kitchen or the lack of drinks when other people MUST have noticed the two glasses sitting at the pass for so long.

All in all it was a terrible experience and we definitely will not be returning, nor will we be interested at any time in trying any other branch of the franchise."}
{"text":"Nice place for Brunch! have been there few times.

I tried their Club Sandwich, Omelettes and Salad. The portions were good and I savored all the items. My Wife has tried some juices and she really likes it.

There always good crowd on weekends but usually you'll find a free table.

Would recommend to try it once, its not a high profile joint but is very suitable for the cost."}
{"text":"Fast service, but lacking in imagination and quality. While I'd come back, I'm more interested in the low early-morning prices and carafe of coffee on the table than in the quality of the food or the mostly uninspired menu items. While the Airdrie Cora has terrible service most of the time, this place lacks the quality and branding that would make the experience enjoyable and more memorable.



We were a little bit skeptical about coming here, given some of the poorer reviews EggsOasis has gotten already, but due to consistently sub-par service at Cora, we chose to check this place out. I'm even more skeptical about trying breakfast places on Sunday mornings due to the high chance of things being really busy and getting poor service. 

When we pulled up, we noticed several open seats on the patio, so we were hopeful that there wouldn't be much of a wait to be seated. When we walked in, we were seated instantly inside, and the waitress was at our table within seconds to take our drink order. We grabbed coffees and waters, and they were there, along with a carafe of coffee, within a minute or two - super fast. We both ordered breakfast food - I grabbed a \"Double Bite\" which included a banana-creme crepe, eggs, meat, and potatoes, and my date grabbed an eggs benedict which came with potatoes and fruit. 

I don't think it was 10 minutes and our meals arrived at our table. Our waitress left a bit to be desired - she wasn't the friendliest person on the planet, but we also didn't really need anything either - there was enough coffee in the carafe, and all of the condiments were already on the table. We ate in peace, and the bill came after our plates looked finished, and we were brought the debit machine to pay up. All in all, I think from the time we were seated to the time we left, we were there for 30 minutes or less. 

The food was good, but not spectacular. The crepes were more like thin pancakes than authentic french crepes - a bit too thick and doughy? The sausage was good, but generic, and the bacon was tasty but thin. Potatoes were cooked well, but a bit bland. Essentially, I could have made this at home, but for not wanting to cook. The menu boasted some very low-price breakfasts from 6-9 AM, and lunch specials that included soup and coffee in the price.

As a note on the ambience: I feel like EggsOasis is having an identity crisis. Their branding suggests a desert oasis, morning refuge sort of environment. What the interior and the menu suggested were very different. There is a very open concept to the restaurant - essentially four walls, divided by a pony-wall pathway from the entrance to the hostess stand. The beige-coloured restaurant was very loud, even though there were a decent number of empty seats available. The walls were decorated with canvas paintings of food items, as well as Rocky Mountain-inspired oil paintings in ornate wood frames. There were the odd palm frond around the restaurant for greenery as well. Even the menu was sort of all over the place, where you could order \"Double bites\" (which really had no reason for the name - the plates were neither double-sized, nor offered much different than the standard egg breakfasts), and things such as  baked beans and creton spread which were considered \"classics\". Basically I feel like the restaurant can't decide if it's going to be themed like a generic restaurant from the 80s, a Cora knock-off, or a Denny's (I feel like the Double Bite may just be their version of a Grand Slam?)."}
{"text":"We went there for Saturday lunch.  It was my first time here and to my surprise, the place had many open tables.  I was expecting the typical crazy crowd similar to what they have at Cora's.  We were seated promptly but the server took some time to get to us for drinks and order.  

The food portions were huge.  Much bigger than at Cora's.  The quality is good too.  I had no complaints on my meal but my companion's meal was nothing special as I was told.  At the end of the meal, it took a while for our server to get our bill to us. I would have given this place a 4-star if not for the service."}
{"text":"Terrible food bad service. Me and my hubby went here when they first open up. Waited 30 minutes before they ask us what kind of drinks we want. Hubby asked for coffee with honey, i just asked for water...drinks came after 10 minutes with no honey.so we asked one of the waiter but they seem very forgetful. Didn't bring any nor refill for the coffee. Food finally came after another 25 minutes of waiting. Potato was burnt and my plate had hair in it..we didn't say anything..second  was today when my sister wanted to try it out.. I was hoping that the bad service we got before was just one in a million chance but nope.. For a weekday being not too busy service is still bad. Ordered traditional benny with soft eggs in it..eggs is close to being raw!and  watery!  Potato is still over cooked. Some were burnt ( maybe that the way they serve it.lol) fruits oh my god ..why would you serve a blueberry that looks like raisin . seriously just dont put it... Over all experience is bleh..not impressed.."}
{"text":"I visited EggsOasis with a group of 8 (6 adults, 2 kids ages 2 & 4) today for brunch. This was a family brunch, and my sister-in-law had previously been to this location, and therefore suggested it.  We arrived at 10.30am on a Sunday and there was no wait, which is unusual for most breakfast places in Calgary, and we were seated right away. 

Our server was friendly, and attentive and was right over to take our drink order. However, she did admit she didn't write it down, and one of the kids got orange juice instead of apple juice. No big deal - this was a quick and easy fix, and our server did rectify it right away when we told her. 

We ordered our food, and it came out after about 25 minutes. My hubby and I both had eggs Benedict and we both commented that the eggs were on the cool-cold side. However, being with a big group with kids, we didn't cause a fuss. We also ordered 2 sides of bacon in the group, and this was forgotten from our order. We did tell the server, and she brought out one side of bacon - we told her again about the second side that was still missing, and it came out shortly after. 

The kids were given colouring sheets and crayons, and this place was a family-friendly environment. However, we weren't super impressed with the food. Service could have also been a little more polished, although our server was friendly and seemed like she tried to put the issues right."}
{"text":"New location, food was great and so was the service. The menu is not as big as a Cora's but then again this is not a Cora's so it wouldn't be fair to compare. Food was  nt that expensive. Presentation was good. Fruits and veggie were fresh. Definitely would go back there again"}
{"text":"Food is good but is your typical fast-food type breakfast. The omelette I had was very greasy, I only ate half of it. I totally recommend their fruit smoothies though. They are seriously delicious and taste fresh. The restaurant itself is very nice and looks very clean."}
{"text":"Food was good portion sizes and generally pretty tasty. However, the service was slow. And unfortunately, I've found hair embedded in my pineapple. When I told my server, she mumbled, \"oh hair? I'm sorry.\" When she returned again, \"how was everything?\" With no prior memory of the hair in my food. Not impressed with the hygiene of this particular place. It is definitely more expensive than Cora as well. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Eggs Oasis (Royal Oak) is my favourite breakfast and lunch restaurant. The staff are super friendly. The food is very delicious; I particularly love their chicken club sandwich, it's my number one menu item. I also love their Montreal smoked meat eggs benedict. My husband and I come here at least 2 times per month. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch on Father's Day. Obviously it was busy but we were seated right away (4 people). 

We waited a bit for our drinks and when we finally got our coffee there was no creamers and sugars. We tried to flag down 3-4 waitresses but no one paid attention to us. We liked that the coffee was bottomless though and that we got a carafe on our table. Anyways not a good start and it didn't get better from there. 

I got the oasis breakfast which consisted of blueberry pancakes, two eggs, sausage, bacon and potatoes. The blueberry pancakes were completely cold. Not even warm a little bit. They needed more blueberries. Everything else was super average, if that. This place is nothing special. The potatoes were plain.

Then my friend was served crepes instead of the Belgian waffle she ordered so they took it back and brought her the Belgian waffle. When they brought it back they said it was 50% off because it was not perfect as the waffle had become stuck to the waffle iron. So they get her order wrong, and then serve her something that probably shouldn't have been served. Or at any other place it wouldn't have left the kitchen anyways. 

Our table had mixed reviews some of my other companions thought the food was cold as well; others said the Cretan, eggs and beans were tasty. It was a mixed bag. Also the chocolate milk came in a super tall glass which was also appreciated. The portion sizes were huge... but would have preferred quality. 

Ultimately however, all the apologies and discounts didn't make up for the lackluster food and service. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"My Royal Oak impression: When you walk into the restaurant you can feel the cheapness and you can tell the owners are looking for anyway to save a penny.

First of all they hire teen's so they can pay them minimum wage and they have no idea what is on the menu, what's in the special and clueless to any questions.

-Fresh Orange juice tasted like orange's were rotten and should have been tossed.
-Food was cold.
-Powered Benedict sauce made by young kids in the kitchen.
-The Fruit waffles were a bit hard, the fruit wasn't washed properly and some of the fruit tasted spoiled.

It cost us an average $20 per person, it was terrible and we won't be returning.

For the cost of the food, you would expect good benedict sauce and proper cooking."}
{"text":"Now THAT'S how I like a restaurant to make me feel.

Eggs Oasis sets an example in its treatment of its customers. When I first walked through the doors, the ladies on wait staff were smiling, welcoming and friendly. They gave me the impression that they were quite happy to see me--despite it being a brunch rush.

They sat me in the middle of the restaurant. This normally would make me exceptionally uncomfortable. But the amazing comportment and good manners of the lady seating me disarmed my anxiety. Like magic. I've never experienced this before. Normally I'd be insisting upon sitting at a booth (and there were three ready booths, tempting me) but I simply couldn't find the discomfort within me to care. That made it an unfamiliar restaurant experience in my mind.

Thinking back upon it now, I believe I actually learned something from their behavior. I. e., that with sufficient social poise and friendliness, you can disarm a person's common social anxieties. Hm, now I'm all thoughtful and pleased.

Other than that gem of a thing, the place was quite clean and busy and orderly and bright.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine and it was quite delicious. I was impressed by being asked if I would like my eggs cooked Soft, Medium or Hard. She chipperly explained the differences and I ordered medium. It was the most perfectly cooked eggs for a Bene that I ever have had the pleasure of having."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late breakfast.  Was surprised to see place almost empty at lunch time.  Thought oh no but we were hungry.  We stayed and were extremely surprised at the food experience.   Farm fresh eggs perfectly poached.  Potatoes described as hash browns were discs of potatoes perfectly deep fried.  Nice change from the usual old fried potatoes with burnt onion.  Fruit on plate was perfect.  Nancy our server  was friendly and very efficient.   I would go back again and try other dishes"}
{"text":"I had high hopes when I walked in because I thought the restaurant was cute (although cheap). The restaurant was pretty empty and it still took us a while to get seated with drinks. Our waitress was standoffish and it took FAR too long for her to take our order. I got the eggs benedict with asparagus. It was cold and the eggs were not cooked. You'd think a place called \"EGGS OASIS\" would have cooked eggs. I couldn't eat it. As soon as we left we started feeling very sick. I'm pretty sure it gave us food poisoning. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than seeing other tables getting their food first even though they sat down 10-15 mins after us.  Poor service...the staff was too busy chatting with each other in the kitchen instead of checking to see if we needed anything or bring us our bill.  The food wasn't very good and you can tell that the fruit wasn't fresh.  Had to spit out a bad strawberry.  Yuck!  Will not come back."}
{"text":"From the outside you would think it would be a more higher end breakfast house but boy that is misleading. I went with a group of 5 and the quality of food is def not up to the pricing they are charging. I be frankly honest, it's like they don't have the \"love\" too cook the food. Bland, funny tasting hollandaise on the Benedicts that tasted like soap. Coffee not fresh. Worst chicken and waffles ever, mushy skin no crisp. Omelettes not worth the money they used cheap meat and sloppy presentation on everything that we ordered. Compare this place to a Denny's but double the price. Do yourself a favour and skip this place. I would've given this place 1star for the food, but the waitresses were stellar"}
{"text":"EggsOasis is located in a great spot, nearby Walmart and other shopping stores & looks quite inviting from the outside; there's a patio and it looks quite spacious inside. 

The hubby-to-be (boyfriend at the time) and walk-in & only end up waiting a short time, which was nice. As we're browsing the menu, they seem to be similar to what Cora's has on the menu, score we think! Until 20 minutes pass and we're still waiting to be acknowledged by a waitress; raising our hand as well as attempting to stop one as they passed didn't seem to work. 

Close to 30 minutes pass and just before we're ready to head out the door, a waitress stops by our table and asks us if we've been helped in which we reply that we had not been; automatically she cops an attitude with us and storms off to loudly complain to another waitress that no one told her that she had another table. After about 10 minutes, we finally see her again & she asks for our drink order. (Normally I wouldn't have waited this long for service, but hubby-to-be & I were feeling pretty ravenous & our first option of Cora's was packed, so it was this or going on another search.

We opted to stay; ordered our drinks & meals at the same time which ended up coming out about another 10-15 minutes later & we devoured it within minutes.

Overall, it was a terrible experience and for the price of the food, I would have rather ate elsewhere; I won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh yuuuuumy!!!! My traditional 2 eggs over easy were perfectly cooked. A nice assortment of fruit came with the plate. My bad for gobbling this up before I could take a picture to show how wonderful it was. Service is quick and friendly.  I like the choice of round fried potatoes or grilled.  Washroom sparkling clean. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice large restaurant, very clean, fast service, friendly waitresses. I went there for breakfast at 6 o'clock in the morning and your options frankly are limited in Airdrie at 6 o'clock in the morning.

That said my breakfast was quick, eggs were cooked perfectly, and the coffee was fantastic."}
