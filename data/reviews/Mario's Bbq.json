{"text":"If there was a no star option,  that is what I would be rating this place. Let me start off by saying,  I went to this location to order a platter of chicken and potatoes for my grandmother's funeral reception.  GOD BLESS HER SOUL. She would have been outraged by this whole mess of what I had to deal with. So I walked in and waited for a few minutes to be served (the woman at the front was yelling and having loud arguments with  the kitchen staff) finally as she served me I asked for my order and for it to be delivered. She yelled at some younger guy to come talk to me about delivery.  We established that he would drop it off to my address at the time I needed it for. I then paid for my order fully as I did not want to deal with it on the funeral/burial day. I waited to get a receipt but she did not give me one and walked away.  So I waited and demanded one from her but she said don't worry about it.  I was already upset I just said ok and left. On the funeral day I was worried that I was being tricked and maybe they just took my money and wouldn't bring the food. So I called at the time they opened.  An older man answered and first said he couldn't find my order so I became panicked and then he said to hold on.  He came back and said he found the paper and it will come. Suddenly I was relieved again.  After the funeral everyone is gathering at the reception and little to my surprise all the other food from other places gets there on time and still no sign of my chicken and potatoes!! ?? Well...  I decided to call again.  The lady that took my order answers and I ask about my food and she said the delivery guy is sick and asked if I can leave the funeral reception and pick up the food. Furiously I jump into my car and drive down to get it as all our guest family and friends are waiting.  BUT WAIT... IT DOESN'T JUST END THERE...  As I arrive I get my order and ask for my delivery fee to be reimbursed.  In total I paid 181$ I obviously know how much I paid so she agreed but as she puts in the order amount and subtracts the difference. . She said the delivery is only 20 or 30 dollars but the difference was 40 once the food and taxes were taken away?!? Anyway she hands me a 20 and didn't want to give me the difference. My cousin had to tell her to give me 30 back at least but clearly there's something wrong with these rude people.  Like come on.. it was for a funeral and she was ripping me off.... really unimpressed.  Horrible horrible place. Would never ever EVER go back. Makes me sick thinking about it.  So if you enjoy chicken made by such terrible people.  Go ahead but there's plenty of good Portuguese restaurants with amazing chicken.  Don't waste your time on bad service.  Thanks ;)"}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst.
The food is a good \"middle\" quality Portuguese chicken restaurant. I find the grilled chicken is better than their rotisserie. however. I gave it a 3 star because the service is poor. They make you wait even longer than you have too to take your order and I find the lady owner can be very rude to the customers."}
{"text":"Chicken grilled just right. Soft, just enough juice and flavourful! The Piri Piri sauce makes anything taste amazing. I keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered Mario's delivery and have been in the restaurant before and both were amazing experiences. The food is delivered promptly and is so hot and fresh. Their chicken is perfect - so juicy!! And so well priced. Delivery guy is always friendly. And don't forget to get their piri piri sauce it's THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cute joint with the best bbq'd chicken in Mississauga. I've been coming here for years and have never EVER been disappointed. Their potatoes are on point! 

Also, the cute guy who's the son of the owner? Such a sweetheart"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great juicy chicken. Sauce is delicious and the price is definitely right. Would definitely come here again! Great job!"}
{"text":"Came here after my graduation with my family and friends. The food was amazing and the best part was since we were so confused about what to order and how much to order, the staff suggested we get 2 and a half chickens and we also got a huge box of rice and potato balls. SOOO GOOD. And the piri-piri sauce was amazing as well. So glad to hear that it will be available in stores soon."}
{"text":"Mario's BBQ is my new place of choice for Portuguese chicken dinners. Tastier rice, better potato balls, and more chicken. The hot sauce is A+ and can buy full bottles of it. Good meal for $10"}
{"text":"Work at the hospital and our group frequently order from this place... The chicken is always fresh.... Juicy and perfectly cooked.... We always call in before we pick up Cuz the line during lunch hour can get really long at times... The potatoes are really flavorful as well... Good choice for dine in as well..."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. The chicken was moist and the piri piri hot sauce was delicious. Got steamed vegetables which was good. Next time i will try the potatoes and rice when i can eat carbs again. $10 for half chicken meal. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, before they moved to this location. One of the best Portuguese chicken places in Mississauga. Hot sauces are the best! Family special is great value."}
{"text":"Real place owned by real people serving great food.  Take out area is great, right in the kitchen, some of the staff could be dudes escaped from Jersey Shore, t-shirts and diamond ear rings. Chicken is delicious, hot sauce rules!"}
{"text":"The take-out here is the main attraction. Not huge selection but whatever is there is usually good. 2 or 3 different types of potatoes and all fantastic. I usually have fish and their cod with potatoes onions egg and olives (gomes de ca) is excellent. Most take-out items are priced fairly
The young guys serving are cool. The owner's wife not so much
Great value for the money."}
{"text":"This chicken is delicious, the rich is amazing the the potatoes are to die for. The salad is always fresh too. This place is great for catering, dine-in or take out, can't really go wrong. Good friendly atmosphere, I suggest anyone that hasn't been here go check it out!"}
{"text":"Always hits the spot, Marios Bbq is by far the best for Portuguese take out in Mississauga.
Service is quick, Staff is friendly, Especially the owners younger son , He is very courteuos with customers at all times, Excellent customer service. The chicken is prepared to perfection full of flavour and usually never dry like other places.
Ill be back soon Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken in town always busy so it tells you something also try the cod when they have it , it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Freshly grilled bbq foods. It is an easy grab and go after work to take home and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the most flavorful Portuguese chicken situated in the heart of Mississauga! Perfect dinner solution whenever you don't feel like cooking. What you get for the price is ridiculous! The rice, chicken and potatoes goes together so well..Must ask for the piri piri sauce, it makes the meal that much better!"}
{"text":"Always great.  The food is reasonably priced and properly cooked.  Chicken and potatoes are great - and great to pick up when you have a group coming over.  Service has always been good every time I've gone in.  I need to get here more often."}
{"text":"Love their chicken & potatoes!!! I can eat it anyday! The service is fast and friendly. Good eats!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today to get lunch to go and was really surprised by the quality of food for a take-a-way joint. If you've never been to Mario's before, this is one of two locations in the GTA, the other being in Mississauga on Hurontario. This was my first visit to the Vaughan location and it's conveniently located across the street from Canada's Wonderland along Jane street, 'just' south of Major Mack.

The chicken was pre-cooked and kept warm in a small oven, but for something being kept warm it was very juicy and not dry at all. I was thoroughly impressed! Typically the trade off for having service this quick (literally out the door in under 5 minutes) is overcooked or under-seasoned chicken - not the case here at all!

I decided to pair my 1/2 chicken with parisian style potatoes (the round ones) and some grilled veggies. The potatoes were great, and while I didn't have any, the rice looked great (I wish I had gotten some). The veggies on the other hand weren't very good, mushy, overcooked and lacking in any sort of real flavour. I take a star away for this, but I think this might have been due to the fact that it was post lunch rush (1:30pm) and items on the hot table may have been sitting for awhile.

I paid for my meal as well as my friends meal and the total bill was less than $25 all in, a pretty good deal considering we also had a drink each!

Portuguese chicken is always my go to \"healthy-quick\" lunch, when I have access to quality stuff, knowing the high quality of food Mario's serves I'm certain I'll be a regular at both their Vaughan and Mississauga locations.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I went here to pick a rotisserie chicken and potatoes. As I came to the cashier to put in my order I asked for the rotisserie chicken. It was 5:30pm and the guy told me they ran out. I asked how they ran out so early and why?  The guy answered that the previous customer took the last 3 and that they haven't made any more. He also told me that rotisserie takes an hour to cook and the grill takes half that time, and that's why they have more grilled.  So I had to settle for the grilled chicken. I took it to my grandparents house who are Portuguese and know they're Portuguese chicken lol. They said it was really good and we're definitely satisfied with the chicken and potatoes as were I. 

All in all, the food is great but the customer service not so much. Being the only reason they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love the food and customer service at the Hurontario location. The location near Heartland should take some tips."}
{"text":"My staple Portuguese takeout place in Mississauga for over 15 years. They have moved twice, and this is their current location. They have a sit in area, buy I mainly go here for the takeout. The BBQ chicken with rice and potatoes is the general fair, but the sis kabob, ribs, roast pork, and steak sandwitches are also good to go. If you get the steak sandwich, pay extra for the sauted onions and peppers, add some of their house hotsauce, and pay the extra dollar or two for the thicker cut steak for the sandwich...well worth it. The only issue with this place is that organization and customer service is not their forte, which while highly annoying at times, is tolerated because the food is good."}
{"text":"Food is so good, some times service so so , but is OK, I will always go there the best chicken place in Mississauga #1"}
{"text":"Great Portuguese style family cooking at BBQ. If you're looking for a quick place to stop off for an inexpensive and filling meal, look no further! I've been going to Mario for years, since they were originally based on Dundas St! 

The chicken is great - moist and full of flavor. The piri piri sauce is great, it really adds a kick to the flavor! I often get take out and bring it home for dinner. The rice and potatoes are alright, and could do for a bit more seasoning. The portion sizes are good and often the servers will load up your platters for you. A $12 meal can easily feed 2 people.

There are often lines during dinner time so you might be waiting for a while. There are some seats available for dine in but most people seem to do takeout."}
{"text":"1st timer. Ordered chicken sandwich only. 230pm on a Wednesday.  No line up, quick pleasant service and sandwich quite good. Large fresh crusty bun with tender tasty juicy chicken breast. Spicy but not an inferno. Option for peppers and onions. I'd eat here again. Cheaper water option preferred though...I will never pay $2.50 for water that's essentially unregulated in our country."}
{"text":"Mr Mario, if I could meet you I would kiss your forehead for blessing me with the taste of your piri piri sauce. 1/2 Chicken Dinner = Half of a GOOD SIZED chicken and two sides (I opted for roasted potato's and veggie mix). Lets just begin by saying that for years, I have been really health conscious. I would plan meals, meal prep, and worked out 5 days a week. Hence, the reason for my big love of roasted chicken. Chicken is Chicken, which is mostly dry when roasted with dry rub. Regardless, the chicken is as delicious as can be, perfectly salty just like I like it. Potato's were nice and plumped, not salted but oven grilled to perfection, veggies tender. For 10 bucks, I cant complain, its honestly big enough to feed two."}
{"text":"I have been coming to take out here for 30 years. The first location on Dundas and the second location on Dundas  And now on 10. They have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty chicken, plus some great sides. My cousin went for the healthier grilled veggies, but I opted for the potatoes. 

Service is very friendly and there's a bit of seating if you want to stay."}
{"text":"Great place for some Portugese Barbecue.  Love the chicken and roast potatoes.  They just moved down the road a bit and its much easier to access.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Portuguese flame grilled chicken and so much more. I usually order delivery but today decided to eat at the restaurant. Having spent time in Portugal, I can honestly say that this is authentic Portuguese cooking. I ordered the \"lulas grelhadas\" (grilled squid) and it was extremely tasty and the presentation was also very appealing. The portions are extremely generous (my wife and I shared one order and it was more than enough). The wine list is not extensive however the wines they do have are a good example of what is available in Portugal. The service was prompt and professional, in no way over the top pushy or over attentive, which is nice to be able to have a conversation with someone without being constantly interrupted by the servers. The expresso reminded me of the typical \"bica\", not too watered down and not too bitter, which is hard to find. We will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time tonight after craving Mcdonalds right beside it but the line was too long. I was intrigued by the bbq smell and delicious looking grilled chicken. After looking at the menu I ordered a half chicken dinner with 2 sides. I wanted the rice and mushrooms and politely asked if I could have some macoroni salad and the owner gladly gave me some. The total was $12 which included my bottle of water.  What a deal! The portiom was massive and it tasted even better! 

The owner even told me that if I ate it and did not like it, he would give me my money back no questions asked!   So I was up for the challenge and the chicken was sssooo delicious! The hot sauce thrown on the rice was even better! 

I will definitely be coming back here for more eats and treats!"}
{"text":"I live in Toronto and passed by Sauga for a professional training. My home area is lacking in good BBQ chicken places so I am always looking for good Portuguese places. Mario's is pretty good. 

As usual I get 1/2 chicken with rice and potatoes. You can never go wrong with this choice. 

As for quality, I can't think of anything special to say. It's just...good. Great portion, great prices, great taste. No complaints from me. I'd go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We went to visit family and decided instead of going out to eat we'd just order take out and bring it back.  I had asked my uncle what we should get since we were in his hood and he had mentioned a Portuguese chicken place called Mario's at Bristol and Creditview that would be good for all of us.  

My uncle also said that this place used to be Sita's but Mario who has another location near Dundas and Hurontario took over this place.  This Mario's location however is basically take out only.

I had looked online for their menu and even noticed that they had online ordering as well.  The ordering had to be done by credit card if you wanted to do it online and since we just wanted to pay cash I ended up calling them and putting in our order over the phone.  Basically what my uncle said was true.  He was saying that we could just go there and pick it all up.  I didn't understand that this place wasn't really a made to order place.  They are so busy that they are constantly cooking birds and that they already have most of everything ready to go cafeteria style.  When I made the call for the order and asked them when it would be ready the person on the other end said it was ready now... OK I get it now.

We drive other and yes there's a lot of traffic in Mississauga around 530pm on a weekday.  We get there and we're third in line to place an order.  I had mentioned that we called in and while they had the order on a piece of paper they were pretty much busy helping others ahead of us and after us, others behind us.  One worker behind the counter looked at our order and on the spot basically just put everything together.  

We went with the family meal #3 which includes 2 whole chickens, a medium salad, a medium rice and a medium potatoes.  After looking at the size of the sides containers I thought we needed to add another rice.  Little did I know the guy who packed the containers packed them tight and to the very top of what they could possibly hold.  Sure these containers are domed lids and rectangular in shape but if there was a contest on who could put the most into these containers I swear this guy was world class.  The rice was so full I had to chip away at it carefully so it wouldn't tumble off because it was a mold of the top portion of the lid, seriously.  Because I also wanted some fish I had ordered another half dozen fried  mackerels which were oh so good.  

The chicken however was great.  I mean as far as Portuguese BBQ chicken goes there are many places out there but I think this place is the best I've had to date.  The chicken is tasty, not dry and their sauce, they make themselves and that too is good.  Their piri piri is not so runny and smooth and consistent in color.  It almost looks like French dressing as it has that color but nope, it's hot sauce.  

As far as quality goes it's very good.  Mario's put together some good options and they're not afraid to put their food on display so you can pick and choose what you like.  The portions are generous.  We were six and we still had left overs and the 2nd rice I thought we may have needed was barely dented.  

With some drinks and all it basically came out to under 80 bucks after tax."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem located in the heart of Mississauga. We decided to give this place a go seeing that it had pretty decent reviews. The last time I tried Portuguese chicken was at Nandos and this place was 10 times better, the food had a very authentic taste. You could tell by the heart and soul they put into making their food. Immediately, when we walked into the mom and pop restaurant we were greeted with a smile. The gentleman who served us gave us recommendations of what to order and even gave us an extra side to try even though the grilled chicken meal came with two sides.

The portions were very generous that we were able to share it between the two of us. It was $12 for a half grilled chicken and two sides. We opted for rice, mushrooms and macaroni and cheese, all of which were cooked to perfection.

The only thing that loses a star was that the chicken was a bit oily. I guess they must have soaked in oil or the sauce to let the flavour set in. So expect the meal to be heavy especially if you are eating it alone.

If you're looking for a place to try delicious Portuguese chicken, come to Mario's bbq."}
{"text":"Awesome traditional Portuguese BBQ chicken joint. I grew up going to Portuguese weddings and family gatherings and it took me right back to my youth. 
Chicken is served right off the grill. Juicy and delicious. Served with rice and potato balls just the way it should be. 
I'm jonesing already for my next visit."}
{"text":"Another place I pass by frequently that I decided to visit today.  I figure if I see 20-30 1/2 chickens on a grill, it must be good right?  Right??

So I ordered the 1/2 chicken dinner with two sides for $10.  The chicken had good flavour but it was a bit dry.  However, it is 1/2 of a BBQ chicken, so it's good regardless - love my BBQ.  The two sides I had were rice and vegetables.  They were okay.  

Would I visit again? Yes, but not right away. There's much better chicken in the area (though it's Caribbean or Middle Eastern)"}
{"text":"This place is no longer a restaurant but a take out place. There is a small sit down area with high counters and chairs. The deals are pretty good. We ordered a whole chicken, full rack of ribs, veggies, potato balls and rice for $34.00 plus hst. The rice was abundant, filled to the brim, the potato balls were mushy and had no unique taste, the veggies were great, consisting of yellow and green beans, corn on the cob cut into pieces and carrots. The ribs were smaller than a full rack and had sauce that is different than the usual BBQ sauce, it tasted more like soy sauce.  The ribs were quite short.  The chicken was served already cut up with peri peri sauce on top. The skin was crispy on one of the chicken pieces, however, the bad part of this whole meal was that most of the chicken was burned!!! This is not good because this is their signature menu item! The peri peri sauce didn't taste home made, it wasn't spicy, it was just okay.

They sell canned or bottled drinks you take from the fridge, but I saw no straws around. They give you paper plates and pre packaged cutlery. 

The place is hard to find as the sign isn't big or noticeable. It's beside the McDonald's.  Parking is not an issue, there is a large parking lot.  

Overall, I'm not sure if I would come back for the chicken as it was burnt. The ribs had a weird sauce. Potatoes were blah. However, they are quick and the prices are good, which is good for a quick takeaway."}
{"text":"Discover Feijoada [Portuguese Pork & Beans] only few days ago.
Frown down on myself to say the least. Pork & Beans! Magic Combo!
It should have been introduced to me while I was a new-born.

3.00 + 0.50 = 3.50 s t a r

I am glad I had it during Labour Day lunch while office's empty.
They don't call Beans the Musical Fruit for n o t h i n g...
This version had subtle smokiness flavour to it as well.

Black Sausage. Cured Ham. Bell Peppers. Beans. Pork. + Rice.

I was expecting Pork to be overcooked while in stew over steam-tray.
Nope. Delicious, I wish there was more than Two 2-bite pieces inside.
Cured Ham provided savoury saltiness to balance Sauce and Beans.

{"text":"Never had a chance to try it I was in there about 20 minutes ago and waited for more then 5 minutes calling saying hello and no one even cam to the front. I saw about 5 chickens on the grill that looked gross. I had chance to look around while wait and the place looked like it has never been cleaned once. The silver door is black. Mario should invest in some staff and a few cleaning supplies.... I f this place was in Toronto he would have a big red fail... i suggest never go there unless you own a commercial cleaning company you should be able to pick up a contract..."}
{"text":"I was excited when I went, but I think I need to go back again to get a better sense. 

They were out of ribs when we got there so we didn't' get to try this! The chicken piece I got was moist, skin was pack full of spices and delicious. My friend's piece was dry.

The potatoes were okay, I liked Brasas better for those. The Portuguese tart was really good, creamy and not overly sweet :)

Service was nice, friendly, like we've been regulars forever!

The tables were covered with sauce and previous diner's garbage. We cleared it off as best as we could, definitely a take out place."}
{"text":"The gold standard in Portuguese chicken. You want the best, just come here. The level of attention and dedication these guys have to make sure they put out the best product is what sets them apart from everyone else. 

I heard a new location is opening downtown soon!"}
{"text":"I go here every other Sunday with my friends.  Some of the best chicken I've ever had is served here.  Always get the chicken dinner with a side of potatoes and fava beans, then smother the fucking thing in their AMAZING piri piri sauce!  Never have I left there without polishing off my whole dinner.  As well, that piri piri sauce is so good that I eat that shit with everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck. A great spot to grab a quick and filling lunch, but not the place to bring someone to impress. It's great for exactly what it offers. Chicken is great and has a bit of a nice kick to it. 

Only complaint was that they didn't give me plastic utensils with my takeout order - small thing, but frustrating. I'm sure they have them, but I didn't think I would have to ask when doing take out."}
{"text":"I don't like chicken  ... but the Portuguese chicken at this place is truly the best. The chickens are roasted using coal hence giving a natural roasting flavour. A great place to get great food on a busy day."}
{"text":"This place is something that I have been meaning to try for so long. And since I finally gave in and went this month, I have actually craved their food and went back again within the same week.

The place speaks for itself, if you wanted a good seasoned grilled chicken, veggies, potatoes or rice...definitely come here. I find that they are generous in their serving and its inexpensive as well. Just a little annoyed that beverages (i.e water bottle) can be expensive now a days, even in restaurants/takeout like this. 

There are a few seats if you want to dine in but customers seem to do take out more. Service is friendly and straight forward so no issues at all."}
{"text":"We love going to marios for a quick chicken purchase. The staff is very friendly they will add some Piri piri sauce to your chicken and cut it all up for you. They send it home with you in a nice little thermal bag to keep it warm. Just be careful because the sauce does start to leak out after some time :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mario's bbq chicken since they open on Dundas and Hurantario that's about 22 year's  they're very good food and very good potatoes very good rice and chicken but their attitude towards customers has gone down the drain their quality of food has dropped dramatically it's just that their heads are in the clouds when you order the dinner the portion of the chicken should be all the same the chicken should be served hot fresh and juicy not dry and dehydrated and cold it's just that they just don't care about their customers there heads are in  clouds and they think they have the best food without any getting any criticism or feedback from the customer if the customer has a problem they should replace the dinner right away without any hassle or questions in the restaurant business customer service and customers are number 1 . If you do go there make sure you get the chicken right off the grill and before she cuts it make sure you're happy with the chicken otherwise she'll give you the worst chicken that she has are the coldest chicken they have from the heater box not from the grill so it is not fresh and hot and juicy if you get it from the heater box tell her that you do not want it from the heater box and if she asks you why tell her it is not hot and fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"I love their chicken and their sauce completes the taste! I definitely recommend it other than the fact that it is delicious, they give big portions and it is also inexpensive. 

The place is more of a to-go place rather than a dine in as there are only few seats available but feel free to dine in if you prefer. 

Overall it is worth trying this place out! My friends and I really loved the food!"}
{"text":"The chicken is the best in Mississauga.  (Short of Portugal, Toronto is where you find the best). Customer service is not their forte. I've followed Mario's BBQ for over 15 years, so I have a soft spot for them. 
I prefer their chicken over Brasas."}
{"text":"Great food but can be a hit and miss. Today the chicken was really dry, rice was uncooked and oh my the lady taking the order whom I assume is the owner gave the worst customer service ever.  The jane location is much better."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Portuguese chicken from Mario's BBQ. My parents used to pick this up all the time from its previous location just east of Hurontario and Dundas, and I can say that, despite the move, for the most part, the experience still stands the test of time - portions are still very large, and the hot sauce slathered all over the chicken is still unbelievably delicious.

Note that the chicken is most likely oilier than you're used to. The chicken is coated in both hot sauce and oil, but it's super flavourful. The skin isn't overtly crispy (it's soaked in sauce, after all), but overall, very delicious. The chicken is definitely the standout; the fried rice is usually pretty average (but tastes great with hot sauce all over it - can you tell I love my hot sauce?) and the potatoes can sometimes be a little bland. But, when eaten together, everything melds together very well, especially when the sauce from the chicken drizzles over everything else - their hot sauce is magic. 

On our last visit, for two people, we ordered the \"family special\" that includes a whole chicken, a medium tray stuffed with fried rice, and a medium tray stuffed with potatoes, for a little over $20. Great value and portion size - we had enough for dinner the next day!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum delicioso!

I've been meaning to try this place for a while now... But I thought to myself, \"this place can't be better than my Portuguese go to place, Brasas\"... Well, it definitely is really close Brasas' flavour. The customer service was awesome, smiling friendly faces and the owners son even made small talk with me. The potions are huge, and the prices are right! I am definitely thinking about using Mario's to cater my next event... I was that satisfied!
 I give the food a 4.5/5 but because of their stellar service they get a 5 in my opinion. Their chicken had a nice crunch on the skin ... I love that the skin wasn't soggy but... It was a tadddd weeeee bit on the dry side and the potatoes could use a bit of herbs or seasoning to jazz it up. The hot sauce isn't too spicy and provides great flavour, and they even sell bottles of the sauce right at the cash. All In all I was pleasantly surprised at this family owned business. I am a little sad it took me so long to discover it. You've gotta try it!"}
{"text":"We've only had take-out from Mario's but the chicken, potatoes, rice and hot sauce are amazing - such good value for the money.  I would give it five stars if the young guys were always serving as they are quick and very polite; however, the wife and another girl are a different story though.  One time the wife gave my husband a container of rice rather than his chicken dinner; he had to go back to the restaurant and she didn't even offer up anything for the inconvenience.  Also, we ordered a bunch of food last weekend for our dinner party and they forgot to put the hot sauce in the bag - what's the point of having the chicken without the sauce ... otherwise, as I said, delicious food though."}
{"text":"On my quest to try Portuguese food I decided to try this spot based on fairly good Yelp reviews. 

Geez I wish I could go back in time. So I wanted a whole chicken, rack of ribs, large potatoes/rice and a salad.

Guy working there accommodated me  and told me he could make it happen for $70, np. I took the food to go.

Let me first just say the first red flag for me should have been when I walked in and saw all the dirty tables with bits of food left over from people eating and how the food in the buffet looked like it had been sitting there for a long time.

Honestly nobody there seemed friendly and even though the guy behind the counter accommodated me by putting together an order for me he seemed like he did not want to be there at all.

My chicken was okay, ribs??? So tough I couldn't even hardly get it down with water, not fall off the bone at all. Rice meh.., Potatoes!?!! Effing burnt!! Yes I got served effin burnt potatoes!! 

Really upset about that and that's why I gave this place a 1* only. How can you serve your customers burnt food?????  

Never will I come back.."}
{"text":"I'm really glad that we found this while in the area! There's great variety with grilled chicken, fish and traditional Portuguese dishes. It looks like it's family owned and operated which makes you feel like you're sitting down and eating with them. The chicken was absolutely delicious. I wasn't too hungry, but I still finished an entire half chicken combo. After that, I didn't eat for the rest of the day. Overall, this place has had the best Portuguese chicken in the GTA. I will definitely drive out of my way to go back here!"}
{"text":"Mario's the best and the worst Portuguese chicken place in Mississauga. I have had a love hate relationship with them for the past 15 years. They were in Dundas, east of Hwy 10 and then they moved further east on Dundas and now on Hurontario and King. 

My issues in the past very incredibly poor customer service. If you spoke Portuguese you would definitely get better service. But the chicken was so good that I would put up with being ignored and sneered at (that was at the first location). 

If you manage to get some chicken straight off the grill it is amazing! However, if you get there when they have too much inventory, you might get a dry burnt piece of chicken. 

After finding out about their new location from a Yelp review, I rushed back. My first visit was good. Then I went back and they were closed. They have inconsistent hours. Monday and Tuesday until 8 then Wed to Sat until 9 and then Sunday until 7. 

On my last visit, the grill was filled with half chickens so I ordered 2, spicy. They go into the back and put  2 half chickens into a bag. Have a look at the attached picture. 

Sorry Mario's I can't take it anymore. You stress me out and playing lotto with my chicken meal is not my idea of fun.  There are other places."}
{"text":"Okayy so coming here on a Saturday was a bad idea for getting take-out here....go figure


We went to the back of the restaurant to get some good Portuguese chicken to take home and ended up waiting about 30 mins for it...which was understandable that it would get busy on the weekends. When we were ordering the owner of the store took our order and was getting it ready but when we asked for sauce for the chicken, there was actually no more. Which was again fine, but she didn't ask if i wanted another type of sauce. Soo When we got home we ended up eating dry chicken...yummy? 

That was the only thing that ticked me off about this place and the long line-up thing. Other then that it was not bad, the potato balls were really good and the chicken was really good too except kinda dry because there was no sauce...insane! 

Next time i come here i will personally make sure we get some sauce for that chicken, i mean it."}
{"text":"Their famous ckhn and sauce is amazing. You got to buy the sauce and put that s*** on everything!!!!!! If you are in sauga and you gotta eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This Portuguese barbecue place is great for those times when you don't feel like making meals at home. 

Upon walking in, you already smell delicious food being grilled or fried. The only problem here is actually deciding what to get. There are many offerings daily such as different types of fried or grilled fish (sea bass, mackarel, cod etc.), grilled squid, bbq chicken of course, cod mix, fried battered shrimp or cod balls. There are also sides such as grilled vegetables (zucchini, peppers, mushrooms), steamed vegetables (cauliflower, carrots), potatoes to name a few that you can include as part of a combo or buy it separately. There are plenty of options for everyone - even my family members who have several allergies and dietary restrictions can easily find something here.

Prices are reasonable for the large portions that you get. Staff are polite and efficient as well with filling orders and getting orders checked out despite how busy they are all the time. They accept cash, debit and credit.

There are also plenty of spots in the parking lot but it just may not be directly in front of this place since it is a busy one. 

Definitely check this place out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"The chicken was burnt and bland. Sauce is really super duper oily. Chicken is somewhat dry and bitter cause burnt."}
{"text":"When I first visited this restaurant I had high expectations since I have gone to other Portuguese bbq places. I order the quarter chicken dinner with rice and potatoes and I was disappointed. The chicken was dry and some of the potatoes lacked flavour and one of the rice grains were still solid. I went back a couple months later with a friend and I ordered the same thing and the food was really good! Went back again a few months after that and the food was dry again. I find it's just inconsistent cause when it's was good the flavours were great! Consistency is"}
{"text":"Note:  Primarily a takeout place, but there is a centre table with high stools.  Atmosphere is definitely take and go though!

As an institution in Mississauga, I am shocked that I haven't been here before.  (I may have been to their old, sitdown location on Dundas Street, like a decade ago.)  Since then, they have moved from their sitdown to Hurontario (takeout).  This change in business model most certainly helps to keep their cost down.

Portion vs. quality, Mario's is a solid, Portuguese chicken joint!  A half-chicken combo - half chicken + 2 sides (salad, steamed veg, rice, round potatoes, &/or fries) = $10.50.  TOTALLY shareable between 2ppl!  C'mon.  Where in the City can you get a legit meal, with sides, for just over $5??  Can't be done.

Between the potatoes and rice, potatoes were much better.  Rice was blander.  I did get the spicy piri-piri on the side, but tbh, the chicken really didn't need it!  Chicken is well-seasoned already and doesn't really need anything else.

You can pre-order off their website.  Looks pretty easy and straight forward.  Going in for a takeout was rather quick too!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Picked up some food here this past weekend.  Burnt potato balls dry rice.  Chicken was meh and they give less sauce.   Not surprised shame on me"}
{"text":"Always a go to place when you want take out but still want something \"home cooked\".  The owners son is always smiling and very friendly. The only reason I'm not giving at a 5 Star is that the chicken can be a miss or hit. Most times it's perfect but sometime it can be real dry. Regardless it's one of my go to places"}
{"text":"Mario's Bbq is definitely a solid choice for Portuguese chicken. Obviously, I can't help but compare it to Brasas. I think the chicken is pretty close but Brasas' chicken wins, as it is better seasoned in my opinion. That's not to say that there's something wrong with Mario's chicken. Just a personal preference, I suppose.

In all other aspects, Mario's Bbq wins. There are far better choices for side dishes. Portions are more generous. The service is great - very friendly, chatty, smiles everywhere (so, like, total opposite of Brasas). The prices are better. Location is more convenient - right in the middle of Mississauga (totally depends where you live though).

I highly recommend it. I'll be back there soon!"}
{"text":"Mario's is solid Portuguese chicken. Sometimes can be on the dry side, but overall good value and good flavours. The potatoes are the bomb, add some piri piri sauce to them and its a party in your mouth!

One time I had a poor experience with possible food poisoning which I attribute to the lady behind the counter using the same tongs for raw and cooked chicken. Which might have been an accident, because I have come here SEVERAL times and never had an issue before."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from Mario's a couple of weeks ago. 

I read the reviews and since they were so mixed (mostly good though), I figured we had to give it a try. I'm so happy we did! 

We ordered 6 half-chicken dinners with salad and roasted potatoes. We were comparing it to our usual go-to Brasas and we definitely were NOT disappointed.

The chicken was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy and oh so tasty. The spicy piri piri sauce was fantastic (better than Brasas in our opinion) and there was plenty of it. The little roasted potatoes were the best we've had! They were crisp on the outside and soft inside. The Greek salad was absolutely delicious.

And the service was just great. So friendly and fast with no super-long lines like there always are at Brasas.

We will definitely be ordering from here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Was here a couple days ago, ordered the 1/2 chicken dinner, came with rice and potatoes. Pretty authentic Portuguese style chicken and tasted very similar to Romaldos in MTL. Portions are very big enough to feed 2 people. Full meal with drink costed around $11. 

Will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best place for Portuguese food in Mississauga, the chicken is perfect and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The best way to describe these guys is ghetto-fabulous. When you look one way you'll say to yourself \"Wow, that's ghetto\". But then you lok the other way and say \"That's fabulous\". 

Example 1:

The outside of their building isn't that great looking: Ghetto
At the entrance to the parking lot they have a gigantic bronze statue of a chicken that looks very expensive: Fabulous.

Example 2:

The dining room decor looks like it has seen better days: Ghetto
The tables are set like you are at a fine dining restaurant: Fabulous

Example 3:

The take-out area is literally inside the kitchen: Ghetto
The equipment they use for the food is new and/or well maintianed: Fabulous.


I had the half chicken dinner. You get some options on how spicy you want your meal to be. Basically what this means is that they're either going to cover your chicken in Frank's Redhot or not. The rice has some colour to it like a spice of some sort was mixed in but it just tasted like butter mixed in. The potatoes were awesome, specially when drenched in their \"hot sauce\".

The young guy behind the counter that helped me was great. He seemed like he really cared about serving me. He also looked like he had the fear of god in his eyes when the manager came into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food : The potatoes are a little bland for my taste I think caramelizing the potatoes would add more flavour.

The rice is ok needs more seasoning and it was a bit greasy but better then being dry.

The chicken was good some pieces had more flavour then others but not bad the piri piri sauce taste like buffalo sauce.

Customer service needs help though. If there is bad customer service then that will turn customers away."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try out Mario's BBQ for awhile but never got a chance till now. 

I walked in on a Tuesday around 1 pm. 

I stood there for 5 minute, looked around and the grill was cold and no one was at the counter to sell me any food.

But I was kind of glad as the chicken on the grill looked sad.

I just left and went somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"It was a pretty cool and chill place to hang out with your family. Went here for lunch time. The only problem I've had was the fact that the roasted vegetables were cold as hell but other than that, I would definitely recommend the Portuguese chicken, honestly the chicken with the sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Mario's BBQ is the better than Nando's.

I've been coming here for a couple years and they've always been consistent. Rotisserie chicken grilled just right, smothered with their home made Piri Piri sauce.

Happy they renovated the place in January to allow better indoor seating (their takeout & sit-in menu were different)

Make sure you grab a bottle of their Piri Piri sauce on your way out, it's addictive!"}
{"text":"I love Mario's BBQ. Ever since they were a little take out place on Dundas which has now turned into a money mart.

Their food is delicious and flavourful. Prices are great and the portions are way more than what you pay for.

Im so happy they launched their own piri piri sauce in a bottle because it is mouthwatering. I truly believe their food is a good reflection of Portuguese BBQ. 

Highly recommend to anyone looking for catering, a quick bite alone or for family!"}
{"text":"I dig this place.  I should mention that I have only ordered take out from this restaurant.  My only complaint is that the line up is a bit insane.  I think it's because the food is awesome for the price they charge.  They have THE best potato balls ever, soft, warm, filled with flavour.  Be sure to get some hot sauce because the hot sauce at Mario's is so good I could drink it on it's own."}
{"text":"Super good chicken, rice and potatoes, the hot sauce has a little heat and great flavours, the service was good too, little seating more of a take out or small group eating section which I didn't mind at all. I would recommend cuz it's very tasty and you get good portions for the price"}
