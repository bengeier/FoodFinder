{"text":"Awesome spot, I found this place two weeks ago and I've already been 4 times. Super good."}
{"text":"I'd love to write a review but this place is closed an Sunday! Not happy at all. A 24/7 town and a NY bagel place, as they say they are, is CLOSED??? Are you kidding me????? You'd NEVER find a closed bagel place in NY.  SMH"}
{"text":"Love this place, the veggie bagel is super good. I love the flavored cream cheeses. They have garlic, veggie, and a sweet one. the coffee is alright, not the best.   Only issue i have is that they sometimes mess up the order, be very clear when ordering. But seriously the best bagels around.   They even sell day old bagels for super cheap. Whicb stay fresh for a long time if you keep them in the bag"}
{"text":"I've been here probably about 20 times in the last 4 months, typically for an onion Bagel with veggie cream cheese. The bagels and cream cheese are delicious.   I saw some review saying there was bad customer service but that is completely untrue of this place. These guys are definitely working hard behind the counter and I've never had a bad customer service experience here.   Knocking off one star because I wish the quality of breakfast sandwich would slightly improve, if so I would be here probably everyday."}
{"text":"I am really upset because i went on my lunch break to satisfy my craving. To my surprise the shop was empty. I walked in waited around for 10 min no one ever came out. I shouted out to get someones attention, there was no response. The shop was empty with no employees. Personally i will never go again. Waste of my lunch break. Really UPSET."}
{"text":"love this place just wish the had gluten free items on the menu. maybe some day,right?"}
{"text":"Service was whatever, coffee was crap and the bagel was the worst I have ever had! One positive, was only $4.50 so I figured I got what I paid for!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place twice a month for several months to purchase 2 - 3 dozen bagels.  I have been treated rudely and have received the worst customer service that I have ever received.  I have gone back in the hopes that maybe it was just an employee having a bad day.  After 4 tries, I am convinced that they just have too many customers and have no desire to do business with new businesses/customers.  After my experience today, I will never go back to this place again.  I REALLY tried.  I'm done."}
{"text":"This place is small & has irregular hours, but a pretty extensive bagel menu, excellent schmears, & from my experience (& having tried this place bc o review from a native New Yorker) this place has the closest to authentic you will find, outside \"The City\", at least in \"Sin City\". There is also a good variety of sandwiches, but j have never tried the gyros. Overall, worth checking out & a great $5ish breakfast/lunch!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite today, and service was fast, as we were the only customers. A pretty large menu, but make sure they get your order right. There is a VEGGIE wrap, which has eggs and peppers, and a VEGETABLE wrap, which has straight-up vegetables in a whole-wheat tortilla. I had the latter, which was OK -- nothing special. My husband fared better with his Italian sandwich, which was a mix of meat and cheese on tasty chewy bread.  Prices were reasonable, but there was no ambiance to mention (mismatched chairs and a couple of TVs). I may stop in again when I'm in the area, but I won't go out of my way. And I'll definitely order it to go..."}
{"text":"The Gyro was absolutely horrible the meat was dry it did come off the cone but they have NO grill to take it and grill the meat or the pita was ran through a toaster it was just warm !The French Fries was the only thing that was hot &Fresh the tomatoes and lettuce was old just a waste $17.06 and when I went to complain they start speaking Spanish and my dad was a black Cuban so I let them finish and then made them aware I speak Spanish as good as you .This place is 5Thumbs down.Kadray Brown"}
{"text":"Yes the bagel are just ok.  Honestly I eat a bagel once every six months but I do stop by here per husband request which has been about five times the past 1.5 years.  They are nothing compared to NY but they are better than Fresh and Easy/Smiths kosher...not even sure what to compare them to. They are not those thick doughy things from Trader Joes, but they are not like the Bagel Cafe places either.  They are light a almost crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. Boiled but maybe prior frozen? Can't figure it out.  As far as having eggs in them, none of them do EXCEPT for the egg bagel that is clearly marked.  She told me that they don't use those crazy dough conditioners (human hair or duck/chicken feathers, yes that what most generics use!) so these bagels are actually vegan.   The service here is always very nice, the lady is always eager to help.  I just wish that here in the medical district area/Alta loop they would step up their game because they could get A LOT of business. For petes sake the Starbucks next door does millions a year! and that's sad."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has so few stars.  Solid bagels and schmear."}
{"text":"Love this place... I've never had the bagels but love the gyro! So good. I would give five stars but the place could really use some freshening up inside and the ordering experience is always odd (order, stand with a bunch of people, 5 min later you can pay, then stand around until someone yells out your order) probably sounds picky but it's just weird."}
{"text":"Damn, the reviews are all over the place: one- and two-star rants about the low-quality bagels alongside four- and five-star raves praising the NY style bagels. Maybe there are consistency issues, but the two bagel sandwiches I've had here have been solidly fresh and tasty.  But if we're focusing on the bagel itself, they're misshapen with oddly large holes. Good chew, fresh taste, and a few different varieties of schmear available (strawberry, scallion, jalapeno, and more). I tend to stick with Asiago, Everything, or Onion bagels, and those have worked out fine for me. The bagels here aren't bad, but they're not going to take you on a mental trip to the Big Apple unless you also drop some acid.  I still think your best bet for a large, perfect bagel is the Bagel Caf√©, but in a pinch this spot will do for breakfast or lunch. Favorite pick is the Empire State, but I sub scallion cream cheese for the mayo and add sprouts. I've never tried the gyro part of the menu.  NOTE: Their Yelp hours are incorrect. All this time I didn't stop by because they're allegedly closed Fri-Sat-Sun, but I swear I saw a sign that said they're open one or both weekend days until 2PM? Didn't think to snap a photo."}
{"text":"The hot bagel sandwiches tasted ok, but they forgot to add eggs on both of the breakfast sandwiches that I bought. They also swapped the top and bottom of the everything bagel and garlic bagel that they made the breakfast bagel sandwiches with."}
{"text":"Store has reopened after being closed for a while.It has now changed hands and the bagels are even better than before. They also have cookies and baked goods. Everything is excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe I just didn't order the best thing on the menu. I attempted the healthy route.  I had a Cesar wrap and although I was excited to see hat I could add avocado for 50 cents!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, they didn't have any. I opted for no tomatoes, because they are gross. There's a \"creamy\" Cesar dressing  that was watery. There was a lack in flavor and I'm not even sure all the chicken was cooked through. Lol. I'm laughing because I ate half until a came across a piece that was borderline. Maybe you'll have better luck with a bagel entree. I made a spur in the moment decision to go here since it was close to my doctors appointment and it was open!!! I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. They definitely have a big selection of sandwiches made with bagels and their bagels are spread good."}
{"text":"This is the closest bagel place to me. Every time I come here. I order a bagel lightly toasted with garlic cream cheese. They heated the bagel in the microwave which makes it rubbery and then they skimp on the cream cheese. I will be finding somewhere else to get my bagels."}
{"text":"The best New York style bagel I've had in a while. Got a toasted everything bagel with plain schmear. Medium size bagel, great texture and taste. I wanted milk but they ran out ... I'd pick this over Einstein's any day. In the strip mall that shares the Smith's parking lot. Bleh atmosphere.  Call in your order to save some time when you're late (my lifelong battle) Mon-Fri:  6am-4pm Sat-sun : 7-2"}
{"text":"Another locally owned place I frequent as often as I can.  I love their breakfast sandwiches.  Eggs, cheese, and meat on you choice of bagel.  I've never had a bad combination.  They also have great sandwiches, wraps, and Gyros for lunch.    The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is that their coffee is below par.  I'm a self-described coffee snob.  I just can't dink the coffee.  Other than that, NY Bagel is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here craving their bagel sandwiches and the door is locked at 1:37 PM on a Saturday. Their sign clearly states that they don't close until 2:00 PM. The open sign was also still lit up. What time do I need to arrive before they lock up?"}
{"text":"The woman who processed our transaction would not get off the phone even while taking our order. She did not make either item the way we ordered it. No onions no tomatoes is not that hard. Also when I order a bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and end up with a plain bagel that is very dry and crunchy I am not a happy customer!"}
{"text":"I love Nova Lox and they did not disappoint. The bagel was served in a form of a sandwich and was packed with lots of salmon. The guys behind the counter were really friendly and greeted us as we walked through the door. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I love this bagel shop, they have sandwiches and gyros. I had a salt bagel Mediterranean sandwich, it was amazing. My son had a chocolate bagel w cream cheese. The food is super quick and the service is awesome. Found a new spot for some delicious grub."}
{"text":"Extensive menu, quick service and good prices, but the food is kind of lackluster..I was disappointed with my chicken wrap - quite \"empty\" and not filling at all :(. I probably should have gotten a bagel sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Let me start off by pointing out that I'm a NYer, born and raised in Manhattan.  Bagels are my thing and I'm picky. When I first moved to Vegas and began working, I needed to find a solid bagel place that is close to my office.  New York Bagel Deli & Gyros popped up on my Google Maps.  I was skeptical at first...a bagel and gyro place rolled into one...in a relatively shady-esque, crowded strip mall.  Hmmm.  Unfortunately, there was no other bagel place nearby at all, so I decided to give it a shot, and I'm sure glad I did! It might not be the best bagel I've ever had, but it sure is the best bagel place I've been to in Vegas so far! They have a solid assortment of bagels and a variety of sandwiches and spreads.  So far, I've gotten the lox sandwich twice and the lox spread and both were very good! The everything bagel is definitely one of my favorites. Prices are also extremely reasonable! It's become my go-to spot when I'm at the office and craving a bagel!"}
{"text":"I pass this place every day on my way to work and finally decided to stop in for a quick breakfast. I was short for time so I called ahead for an everything bagel sandwich with egg, bacon, cheese and a little butter. When I arrived it was ready, hot and very good. As I wasn't expecting much, I'm rather surprised at how much I enjoyed the sandwich despite the lackluster presentation."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've found so far. Was hot and juicy not dry and cold like I've found at other gyro places. I've also had one of the breakfast bagels before and it was really good. will come again."}
{"text":"Visited last thursday to get a quick gyro fix. Opted for the gyro platter. it was 50 cents more than the gyro it's self. But let me tell you, it was well worth it. Came with a huge portion of meat on top of a pita with lettuce tomato and onion on the side. Along with your cucumber dill dip you can opt for fries or hummus. Man that hummus was delightful. Not to grainy or oily but perfect for the soft pita i had. Will definitely have to try the bagels next. Almost forgot to mention, I had so much leftover that I took it home. I was dying to eat it the next afternoon only to come home to my roommate begging for the name of the place. At least we enjoyed it together!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in between a busy Starbucks and a large grocery store, among other small mom and pop shops. I needed a quick bite to eat and didn't want to deal with the line at Starbucks so I decided to pay a visit.  There's a huge poster in the entrance that advertises their $3 special for bagel with cream cheese and coffee. Bingo! I made my way in to divulge in their special. The dining area isn't anything extravagant, it's just what you need with lots of tables and chairs. Walking up to the order stand, I was quite disappointed to see that three-fourths of their bagel selection wasn't available. It was 10:50 AM so I wasn't sure that they just sold out of everything earlier in the morning or if they don't offer a large selection as listed. I opted for a simple blueberry bagel with cream cheese.   Unlike Einstein Brothers where you can see the preparation of your food, this place has a huge wall from the order stand to the cashier's stand so preparation isn't visible. Whatever, I figure you can't mess up a bagel with cream cheese. They toasted my bagel (I didn't ask for this but I think I'd be annoyed if I didn't want it toasted) so that it had a nice crunch. But the bagel had absolutely no flavor. Blueberries? Nah, this bagel had me scratching my head wondering where the blueberry good ran off to.  They serve regular coffee as well as vanilla flavored coffee. Their vanilla coffee was pretty good, can't complain about that.   As the name states, this place serves gyros and deli sandwiches. Their \"New York\" bagels didn't impress me so I'm not sure if I'll be back anytime soon to try other items on their menu.  Sad face."}
{"text":"I'm really sad about this place, I had high hopes that it would be amazing since they claim to be NYC style bagels. But sadly they weren't even as good as Einstein bagels :( won't be back again."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel place in LV.  Staff is really friendly.  Get the everything bagel with jalape√±o cream cheese on one side and vegetable cream cheese on the other.  Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Not so great. Order egg and cheese for breakfast. One guy at the counter. Egg was cooked through microwave. Bland! No salt or pepper. Should have went to mc donalds instead. Was hungry. First and last time here."}
{"text":"A little amazed at the number of positive reviews.  Walked in, ordered a bagel w/coffee.  They were out of creamer and out of 1 of the 2 flavors of coffee they offer.  I sit, eat my bagel then decide to order 2 VEGGIE SANDWICHES to go.  I pay I leave.  I get home open the bag unwrap the first bagel and realize it's not a sandwich just a shmear. I open up a second Bagel same thing. No sandwich. I call find out what happened and instead of apologizing for the mistake the owner actually yelled at me and blamed me for the error.  To annoyed to even deal with this guy I told him to go pound dirt and hung up on him. I will never ever take my business to New York bagel again and recommend anyone else think it twice."}
{"text":"The bagel I just finished eating has inspired my first on-the-spot yelp review, which I am writing from a table in the center of New York Bagel Bakery.  If I'm being honest, there are better bagels in Las Vegas. For me though, bagels and cream cheese make up the entire package completing the experience, and NY bagel bakery has probably the best cream cheese I've ever tasted.  Like many of my reviews, my opinion is affected greatly by the hot and spicy options available at a given establishment. The jalape√±o cream cheese offered here is perfect. Just spicy enough to provide a great kick without compromising the fresh taste of the already delicious cream cheese.  Despite what I said about better bagels elsewhere in Vegas, these are quite good. You can tell they make them fresh and the flavor and consistency is the way a great bagel ought to be.   There's a large sandwich menu for breakfast and lunch and they even have salads. I haven't tried anything except the bagels but given the outstanding quality of the food, I'm pretty sure I'll try it someday.  Decor and atmosphere is fair.. It's a comfortable place to hang out and enjoy a nice breakfast with the family."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a while since I read the reviews on yelp. I found it because it was walking distance to where I work and there wasn't a lot to choose from in this area.  This joint is a true hole in the wall! I can't believe they've been here for 3 years. Got here at 7 AM and we were the first customers but it quickly filled up. The gentleman helping us was by himself but he did a great job. I got the lox & eggs on jalape√±o bagel and my coworker got the egg & cheese on cinnamon raisin. We were both blown away by our first bite! The bagels were soft and truly fresh, the lox had the perfect amount of salt (I often find them too salty), and the cheese mixed so well with the cinnamon raisin (I had a bite of that too).   This will be my GO TO breakfast spot from now on and now I know I have something new to tell my friends about that no one has heard of!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick snack and needed something different.  Small little bagel deli'ish establishment. Got a pastrami bagel sandwich that was decemt. Wasn't horrible, but it definitely didn't hit the mark, or very close to it for that matter.  The young man served me in about 5 minutes and then promptly returned to the table of young girls he had been talking to when I came in.   I'd keep shopping around....."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and we really love the French Toast Bagel! Often times we order the breakfast sandwich bagel and it is quit filling considering it's misleading \"little\" size lol. I really enjoy this Bagel Bakery and I hope it's around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Very good spot clean and friendly staff 2 other location one in aliante and another on rainbow, always get there turkey cheese or veggie wrap for breakfast always good and fast service."}
{"text":"I loved this place people were nice, I asked to wrap my food really well since I would be taking it to go and he did. Amazing!!! I will be back!!! I was actually looking for a good Gyro place other places I just haven't liked and I found the place right here! Very clean very upbeat people. I was sitting down and the woman came and brought me my order instead of saying here you go. Even called a friend while there saying we had to go one day for lunch"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food. They also have a good selection of bagels and cream cheeses. I've been here several times and it's always been a great experience."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. How do you screw up an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich? I knew that I was in trouble when the guy asked me if I wanted the bagel toasted. Yes, and please cook the egg and melt the cheese.  I award you no stars and may God have mercy on your soul.(Yelp won't let me give zero stars.)"}
{"text":"Not quite worthy of the title of New York Bagels but still a good place that deserves for stars for decent food and a solid breakfast at a good price."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and this is the closest place I can find to my house that is comparable to good ol NYC bagels AND they deliver! Which is awesome for my days off when I don't want to go anywhere"}
{"text":"The BLT is delicious. About once a week I get a craving and this place really delivers. My husband grabs us bagel and smear (mine with tomato) and 3/4 of the time it is correct. (Full disclosure: my husband has a German accent. So it might be a language barrier) I think this place is a gem. Support local business."}
{"text":"They are right next door to a super busy starbucks, and so I went in one day to see what it was like.  I was very underwhelmed with the service.  The counter makes it kind of hard to see what they are doing behind while making the food.  I was actually late to work becuase they took so long with making my bagel and ringing me out.  The staff is friendly enough but somewhat slow so don't go if ur in a rush!"}
{"text":"The only place I've found in town that has a pretty close NY style bagel. The sandwiches on the bagels are very good. Don't waste the bagel by toasting it.  They also have good salads and sandwiches that aren't on bagels."}
{"text":"Best bagel spot in town!!! For lunch or breakfast. I used to go to Einstein's bagels but this place has better food and the prices are even a little better. The guy who owns it is an awesome dude as well, been coming here for years now. Often times I just go in and ask him to make me whatever he feels like making, which is easy for me cause I like all food, and end up with the best sandwich I've ever eaten for like 8 bucks. (If you do that be sure to leave a good tip!) Favorite place for breakfast or lunch, these guys are rad.  My goto breakfast sandwich is like the mushroom swiss breakfast bagel with added veggies, plus sundried tomato cream cheese and bacon on an everything bagel. So basically all veggies in an egg omelette with bacon and the sundried tomato cream cheese really kicks it off.  Bomb.com  But like I said lately Ive been coming for lunch and just having them make me whatever they feel like and its off the hook."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food. Love their gyros! Just hate the fact their closed on Fridays :("}
{"text":"This place is not too far from my work and I have been meaning to come here on a lunch break. Out of all the places in my area, this is one of the better ones because it is not fast food, and it is not a chain.  I think it is quite popular in the mornings, because when I arrived around Noon a majority of the bagels were all gone. I noted they sell day-old bagels bagged up for $3 a pop. I will consider coming back here for those, maybe on a Friday so I can take them home for weekend breakfasts.  Pretty simple gist to this place: bagels, bagel sandwiches (lunch and breakfast variety), plus they do a gyro sandwich and a gyro platter. I went for the gyro sandwich. I mean, it was OK, it wasn't the BEST gyro I've had, nor was it the worst. I am thankful they didn't completely douse it in tatziki sauce.   I think you may want to contemplate this mantra before coming here, \"You get what you pay for.\". Prices are low, sandwiches come out quick, aaand it's just a little hole in the wall place that is convenient. Oh by the way, don't get the fries - they weren't good. Opt for a bag of chips instead."}
{"text":"Gyros are the best I've had in Vegas.  Pita is nice and soft & meat is tender.  Just the right size to fill you up on a quick lunch break.  Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS for a NEW YORK BAGEL SHOP in BRIGHT LIGHT CITY    The New York bagel is a part of my heritage. Unfortunately my heritage is on the other side of the continent. The next best thing to paying at least $800 round trip to fly between Vegas and New York plus parking, car rental, and taking time off is to patronize a Big Apple bagel shop in Bright Light City. New York Bagels does a good job of bringing me to a New York State of Mind.     The New York bagel is as rare as a snow blizzard in Las Vegas. I only know of three New York style bagel shops in Vegas. They are Bagel Cafe, Harry's Bagel mania, and New York Bagels.     Recently I have left Vegas for a New York bagel experience on three ocassions when I was in the area of Springs Preserve. On each occasion I ordered a different bagel sandwich. In three visits I'd experience a delicious toasted poppy seed bagel with lox, tomatoes, onions, and cream cheese, a toasted poppy seed bagel with egg salad, and a toasted sesame bagel with bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. The lox sandwich is my favorite. I love lox on a toasted bagel. Maybe it is a biased taste that brings me back to my elementary school years sitting with my grandparents at the table enjoying a lox sandwich breakfast. Biting into the lox sandwich brought me miles and ages away from Rancho at Charleston. My second favorite sandwich is the egg salad. Biting into the Bagel overflowing with delicious egg salad brought me back to my twenties, enjoying breakfast in a New York bagel shop. And the BLT brought me into the adjacent Starbuck's to enjoy the sandwich with a cup of Starbuck's coffee. The New York bagel shops never served premium coffee. This one is not an exception. The Coffee is decent. It is nothing that has a bad taste  like it came out of Lake Mead or a premium taste like it came from Starbuck's or Einstein Bagels. Einstein has New York beat on coffee. Anyways a delicious bagel sandwich and Starbuck's is a great marriage of sandwich and beverage.     New York Bagel is a self serve bagel shop unlike Bagel Cafe. There is a menu board on top of the Bagel case. The majority of sandwiches with a coffee will come up to less than $10. When you decide on what you want, you tell the friendly person working here your order and a few minutes later it is ready. There is sufficient seating in New York Bagels. There was never a dirty table in the room. At the corner is a rack where people are free to read the local free newspapers.     Just like my New York Heritage, I am a bit vocal. I will state my minor complaints slash constructive criticism. To start off, there are some sandwiches with the corresponding prices are omitted. The Bagel potpourri scent that I am accustomed to in the New York bagel shop is missing here. The bagels are not as soft, warm, and in all honesty as delicious as the New York bagel shops of yesteryear. The side item that is omnipresent at the New York bagel shop is air here. I used to love the slice pickle and potato salad or macaroni salad that went with my New York bagel sandwich. I enjoy taking a few bites from the sandwich then the potato or macaroni salad. This is like having a hamburger without fries. My ultimate vocal is addressing the fact that the Bagel case was in want of critical varieties at noontime on Sunday, October 26, 2014. My fellow New York friend wanted me to pick up either a pumpernickel or salt bagel. Both of them were out.     New York Bagels is one of three bagel shops that I currently know of that are as close as Las Vegans will get to the New York bagel experience. Under the neon of Bright Light City it momentarily brings me across the continent to the Big Apple. With that said I support a part of my heritage by bestowing New York Bagels with 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's a good solid bagel. Sadly, being from SC, I'm use to the Einstein's of the world. This is more like a real NY bagel with that nice crunch on the outside. A little small in size with very little bacon that seemed pre-cooked but fine.  Still in search of the best bagel in Vegas."}
{"text":"Coming from the North American East Coast, I have been spoiled in the bagel department.  This place did not do it for me.  At all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We were visiting from hawaii and we got to meet Ramona and the staff... they were very friendly and the food was great. We all (4 )ordered different things and it was to die for. We don't have this kinds of stuff here in hawaii so it was a treat for us! We will be back here for sure next time... don't worry ramona, we will be sending you a postcard soon!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a gyro from this place and the cashier kept calling it a ji  (long I) row. I corrected him and he did it again.  I will not be back. How can I eat at a place when their employees can't even pronpince the name of what they're selling. Also everyone was so grumpy. Very sad place, no smiles."}
{"text":"Started going since new owners took over. Now I stop whenever I can. Breakfast and lunch are great and bakery items are awesome!"}
{"text":"Here for my brother's 20th birthday and he's loving it. He's a regular and this is my first time. I only got a bagel to go but I'm going to go back to see what else they had. I got a taste of the iced tea and it wasn't too sugary like most places. I want to make a more in depth review next time I visit but the bagel was delicious."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but I saw cockroaches on the floor near the restrooms. Didn't order anything.  Immediately left."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for bagels. Although their bagel is basic and simple. I really enjoy their customer service and their cream cheese. The jalapeno, vegetable, and sun-dried tomato cream cheese is very delicious and tasty! I usually come here in the morning and purchase their bag of bagels and cream cheese and bring it into work. every one loves it and get all excited when i bring it in.   Will definitely want to try their breakfast bagels next time"}
{"text":"awesome food, good prices, nice speedy service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Las Vegas to get a gyro. Staff is always friendly. Bagels are also good, but I rarely get one because the gyros are so awesome."}
{"text":"Yummy low fat chicken wrap. Fast and friendly service is perfect for a quick lunch. Also decent prices."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning and was very glad I did. I had a garlic bagel with jalape√±o cream cheese, egg, ham and cheese. It was great lots flavor especially the bagel. Will definitely repeat. My brother had the Reuben which he said was very good and full of flavor. Located in a strip mall next to a pizza place and starbucks/ port of subs. Nice little bagel shop setting couple small tvs. Bag of day old bagels (6) for 3$ good deal."}
{"text":"Talk about a literally hole in the wall restaurant! However I went here for lunch today and found myself a fresh, unique treat! I ordered the gyro plate served with steak fries and side of zesty yogurt dip. You can tell from my picture that the food just looks so fresh. I was able to wrap up my own gyro with some lettuce, tomato, and shaved lamb-beef meat. Mmm it was a light, perfect dish for my belly!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the bagels or the deli but as for the Gyros and Greek food, they should really take it off their menu. The gyro meat was greasy and not flavorful at all. The meat was placed on the pita, which was soggy because of the greasy meat, and was warmed in the bagel warmer,it wasn't fresh at all. The hummus was bland and the white sauce was watery. I would not recommend this place if you want Greek but I saw a guy eating a bagel sandwich and it looked good."}
{"text":"Came to this place cuz it was right across the place from my doctors appointment. I ordered the Ellis Island bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and my boyfriend ordered the gyro with everything on it. The everything bagel was so good. Most everything bagels have too much garlic or too many poppy seeds or sesame seeds but this bagel was nice and salty with not too many poppy seeds. I also liked how it was still soft even after it had been toasted. The pastrami was tasty and the mustard complimented it perfectly. The gyro meat was tender and very flavorful. I liked their tzatziki sauce cuz it had a nice hint of cucumber. And the two guys working there were really nice and chill. Didn't take too long to make our order. Cute little local business. Will try to come here more often."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait and be ripped off.  Special in window was $2.99 bagel with cream cheese and coffee.  Tea is extra.  You didn't ask for the special.  Everyone was paying almost $5.00.  It is a shame because these are the best bagels I have found in Vegas."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC I am very disappointed in this place.  NOTE: when I first tried New York Bagel on Rancho in 2012 i thought they were about average for non NY or LA bagels.   END NOTE  My office gets bagels every Friday for the staff.  However, the last time we purchased bagels for the office the bagels from New York Bagel Deli and Gyros they  were thin and small and had a different consistency than expected.  That is why we stopped getting bagels from here for our weekly bagel day.  It is clear that the person making the bagels does not know the way to properly make a NYC style bagel.  There are much better bagel options in town such as Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"Stopped here this morning and was horribly disappointed. Got two breakfast sandwiches.. They literally are just microwaved frozen eggs and meats.. The egg was wet and rubbery and basically inedible. In addition to this, we had two bagels with cream cheese.. The layer of cream cheese was literally so thin it barely covered one side of the bagel. There was one employee in the whole place at 730 am on a weekday, should've taken this lack of business as a sign not to eat here! Will NEVER be going back!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent the everything bagel toasted with smear was fresh and delish coffee was great. First time here I will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the gyro with extra veggies and my little human loVe the fresh bagels.    A great locals spot. Off the strip, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years out of convenience and basically because there are no other decent bagel shops around.  The bagels are consistently decent but not amazing.  You can do better, but not much better in LV.  Someday there will be a 'great' bagel shop in LV, but until then NY Bagel Bakery will take care of your needs competently and affordably.  Compares favorably to Noahs/Einsteins.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food and the price was right!  I found this place while driving around the outskirts of the strip and glad I did."}
