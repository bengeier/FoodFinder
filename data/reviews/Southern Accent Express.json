{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place. Me and my fiance came here to order takeout. The place was dead...and we came at 1pm. Also, the decor was pretty boring..not comfy at all. 

We ordered the shrimp poboy and the voodoo pasta.
The shrimp poboy was nothing special. My fiance said the shrimp were smaller then expected. The only thing he liked about his food was the bread. 

I ordered the voodoo seafood pasta. The portion was okay..a little smaller then I expected. The seafood was overcooked and small. I swear it tasted like the frozen  seafood mix you can buy in food basics. There was no crawfish too! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was pretty tasty. I expected more to be honest. 

We will be back though. I still need to taste the Mac n cheese and the calamari.


UPDATE: went back to get the fried calamari and Mac n cheese. The calamari was tender but too salty and by the time I got home it was not crispy at all. The Mac n cheese was pretty good. Heavy but pretty good flavor."}
{"text":"This little store does not seem like much on the outside, but let me tell you that it serves the same tasty, spicy cajun cuisine as the restaurant downtown. We had ordered the Voodoo pasta (seafood), hush puppies, cornbread, piquant shrimp, a shrimp po' boy sandwich, two root beers, poutine with brisket, bread pudding and a wedge of pecan pie. The pasta was just as delicious as the one prepared in the Mirvish Village restaurant, the po' boy was tasty, the hush puppies with sauce and piquant shrimp was hellishly hot (in a good way) and we fought over the bread pudding with banana fosters sauce. Again, the portions are generous so we had enough for lunch the next day. It is awesome to have such a great place so close to home. Thanks to the wonderful guys and gal who prepared our dinner tonight. :-)"}
{"text":"Southern Accent started up in the Annex Downtown and recently opened up a location at Midland and St Clair in Scarbrough. I love that there is now a Southern food place on the East end of the city! I have been meaning to go in and just stopped in for their coffee and beignet special (1.95!) this morning. The service was great and the coffee (I am drinking now) is very good! The beignets were made fresh to order and were warm to eat. The menu looked great, the oysters and brisket po boy sandwich were items that caught my eye first. I am looking forward to trying a full meal at this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket poutine, let's just say the poutine was great MINUS the brisket which tasted like canned dog food. The hush puppies were crispy on the outside but doughy on the inside. I mean it wasn't horrible but I wasn't impressed. I will try again because I heard the sandwiches are good and I'd like to try the shrimp po boy . Oh I also had a butter tart which was delicious but probably not made in store?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the restaurant in the Annex a couple of years ago and had an amazing dinner. We went to the Express restaurant this evening in anticipation of the beignets. The girl serving us was very friendly and helpful. I asked what the most popular dish was and she told me the blackened chicken and brisket were. I ordered the seafood voodoo pasta dish (I had it at the restaurant and it was the best pasta I had ever had, this time it was disappointing and under seasoned) and my husband ordered the brisket (it wasn't as tender as we expected and it was also under seasoned. 

The beignets were the highlight of the meal. There were four of them and they were quite small but delicious. If they would make them in the shape as the beignets you get at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans they would be the closest I've been able to find. We really wanted to like this place but we just didn't, maybe we're biased from our restaurant experience at the Annex."}
{"text":"March 14 2017. I literally just drove across the city through \"Winter storm Stella\" to buy a sandwich from here and it was worth it! i also did it yesterday LOL, but if wasnt through a the worst storm of the year!."}
{"text":"I thought it was a fairly decent set up for a take out place. They do have a sit down area and it has a diner feel to it. The prices are fair and the kid at the cashier is incredibly informative and knowledgable about the menu. I didn't go check it out for so many months because the online menu showed such little selection but the reality is - there is a full fledge menu available and it's pretty awesome priced! gourmet food on a dollar. 

I had the seafood pasta which had an amazing sauce but the line cook didn't boil the pasta long enough so it was a bit hard (I heard it was his first couple of shifts, but still quality is important).

I loved their calamari which is only $6. 
Their seafood pasta is $11(and nice quantity of it too!)
Their blackened chicken was good but I prefer the breast cut into strips or pieces that way I taste more of the flavour, instead of a hunk of breast. I forgot the pricing but the mashed potatoes and veggies were great. 

when I went in the second time the owner told me that he would give me some sugar beignets on the house due to the undercooked pasta my first visit 
 - and they were a tasty treat at $4-5.

Overall i'm bound to be a regular at this location (since it's only a hop away from me). Honestly, this restaurant probably deserves more traffic and customers than its currently getting."}
{"text":"Southern Accent's got a rotating vegetarian main, and it's always proven to be well-executed and decent for value. It also happens to be gluten free in case anyone has that preference/restriction.

Their tofu po'boy is solid too--one can't complain when a sandwich + fries combo is $6. If you're satisfying a sweet tooth, their sweet potato brownie is worth a taste. On top of it all, you can get a Babbling Brooke's Root Beer from Nickel Brook Brewery to round out your fast food experience."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Scarborough  location ever since they opened, I love the food, best Mac n cheese I've ever had and at $5 the price is right                          HOWEVER.. the past two times I've gone their my Mac n cheese (that is premade in the morning at the downtown location and heated for tops 1 min in the oven but still delicious) has taken 20 minutes to a half an hour. I'm extremely disappointed  in the service so I won't be dining there anymore...maybe if they address this issue I might consider going back."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every two weeks and I've yet to be  disappointed. I recommend the blackened chicken! *drool*"}
{"text":"As I was already in an area I wasn't normally in, I thought to myself let's forget the Pizza Nova next door and try something different.

Walking in trepiditiously (yes, I may have just made that word up). I was greeted by a very jovial and welcoming group of staff. Being a person who's afraid of spicy food, I was really nervous but they quickly put my mind at ease telling me that many of their menu items could be made 'mild'.

Ambience is casual about 6-8 tables with tablecloths and lamps. Their menu required some studying as it's quite varied. I eventually was encouraged to get their pasta in a creamy sauce with chicken and sausage (no spice). This dish did not disappoint! Tri-coloured pasta, slightly firm with a good amount of meat.

They also offered a taste of their jambalaya which was just at the border of my spice tolerance. Wash it down with an Arizona half lemonade half mango drink and I was a happy camper.

As I was the only customer at the time and all the staff were giddy that they had gotten their liquor license and could offer their Scarborough clientele their fabulous cocktails from the flagship store at Bathurst and Bloor, they were quite chatty. Hearing about the history of the restaurant made me enjoy my experience that much more!

I'm glad I didn't go familiar! And I'm planning to go back on a day off to try one or two of their signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from here for the first time tonight, and opted for a \"family style\" approach in order to try as many items from the menu as possible. It did not disappoint.

Firstly, the service was wonderful. Upon placing the order, we were told the food would take approximately 45 minutes. When the delivery time was delayed due to a busy kitchen, we received a phone call from the restaurant apologizing and offering us free desserts and drinks. This was such a kind and unnecessary gesture, especially considering the fact that the food was only 15 minutes late. 

The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the mac and cheese, brisket, jambalaya, shrimp po boy, hush puppies, cornbread, and banana bread pudding. Two sweet potato brownies were thrown in due to the aforementioned delay. While all were mouthwateringly tasty, with generous portions, the standouts were certainly the brisket, jambalaya, and po boy. Fries and collared greens, which accompanied the main plates, were on point. Dessert was surprisingly amazing, with my personal favourite being the bread pudding. Wow, that was great. 

We ended the meal uncomfortably full, and yet wishing for more. Will certainly order again in the future, as I look forward to trying the catfish and gumbo. Thank you for the dinner!"}
{"text":"Went to get take out tonight. No One answered the phone, so I assumed they were busy. Their hours are supposed to be 2-10 today according to the outgoing message. I showed up at the door. The place was all closed up, no holiday notice, nothing. What's happening guys?"}
{"text":"3.75/5

I had the Cracked Catfish and grits. I really enjoyed them both. Was a good batter on the fish and the grits were creamy and went well with the fish.

My wife had a shrimp po'boy. While it wasn't as good as New Orleans, it's hard to find a po'boy in Toronto.

We also had sweet potato fries that seemed a bit under done.

Our meal came with 3 sauces: a tartar sauce, ginger remoulade, and a spicy mayo. All pretty good."}
{"text":"Yummmm!  Great food, great service, friendly.  Great addition to the neighbourhood.  Free samples!  We'll be back:)"}
{"text":"Amazing Cajun food for an affordable price!    Had the jambalaya, hush puppies, blackened chicken and voodoo pasta.  All were amazing 5/5!"}
