{"text":"Showed up here at 8 PM on a Sunday (a hour before close) with the intention of ordering for takeout.  The place was quiet as one would expect, and this was our first visit so we didn't really know what to expect beyond that.  BUT, we were pleasantly surprised to say the least.  I wanted to order a dish of Mao Po Tofu, which wasn't on the menu and the cook came out and told me that she would gladly prepare it!  Awesome.  My girlfriend wanted to get their Singaporean Chow ___ Fun (can't remember the exact name) but with tofu and she was totally happy to do that as well.  The sesame chicken, a so-so staple of the Chinese food world in the US, was excellent.  When she presented us with our order, she even made some homemade hot mustard for us to try with the egg roll they gave us.  Pow!  Stuff was strong, but excellent.  Overall the food was delicious, crisp, flavorful, not overly oily, and we did not feel hungry an hour later!  Great service, great food, a must try."}
{"text":"If you want really good chinese food, and not just the same old carryout, go to China Qiu. This place is under new management and boy is there a difference from the old buffet that used to be here. The quality of the ingredients is more in line with PF Chang or ENoodle, without the expensive prices. You can tell the chef takes some pride in preparing your dish. We had the Moo shu pork and sesame chicken. both were really good. Service is top notch and the place is spotless. They have really good lunch specials under $6 and comes with an eggroll and rice. We are now going once a week!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Concord area and looking for a good restaurant, I highly recommend China Qiu on Highway 29 near First Assembly/Concord Fire Station 3. Clean, inexpensive, and delicious with incredibly nice staff, it's become the place that my family and I tend to meet if we go out for dinner. I think they're slowly growing in popularity, and they definitely deserve the business! Conveniently located between a number of fire/EMS stations, and they have great lunch specials..."}
