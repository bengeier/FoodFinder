{"text":"Within the range of ordinary/family restaurants, the Masala offers at least 3* food. The onion bhaji and vegetable fritters served as appetizers were truly delicious accompanied by a tasty fruit sauce (pineapple?). The shish kebabs were however dry and chewy however much mint sauce was added. All main courses sampled had fabulous sauces. Unfortunately, the meat in the  beef and chicken dishes had been simmered to the point of an unpleasant texture. The lamb sampled was succulent, as were the spinach/potato and cauliflower accompaniments. The service was attentive though explanations were hard to understand (I did not even attempt to speak in my native french). And it should have been, as the venue was nearly empty on this Saturday evening. Perhaps because of the location, the Summer season, or the rather dull decor. All things considered, I am glad to know of Mandala's existence as it is somewhat better than the typical fare in NdG's Sherbrooke west. But I will probably order out another time."}
{"text":"The food tasted good (especially the paneer makhani!) but the portions were very small, yet very expensive. Service was mediocre (the waiter makes jokes like charging you for tap water but you never know if he's serious or not). The naan basket was very dirty, full of dust."}
{"text":"Steps from the Snowdon metro, two of us went early on a quiet Sunday night and ordered all vegetarian dishes. Fantastic garlic naan and well flavored sag panir (spinach cottage cheese), OK vegetable curry. Pleasant, but distant service. People keep mentioning the portions, but I find them equal to other Indian restaurants. And the lunch menu is an incredible deal for $7-$8."}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, mais malheureusement le restaurant n'est pas très agréable.

Mieux vaut commander pour emporter ou faire livrer!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Naan is perfect, Lamb Korma was the dish I tried I likes it, but the size of their dishes is not acceptable for the price they charge (when you order by phone or online you get more food, but two times I went to dine in there the dishes were so small that made me to go for an additional naan."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place when it was called Sitar, and over the years its ownership has changed hands a number of times I believe. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants and then it ceased being so for various reasons. A few weeks ago my sister and a friend wanted to order some Indian food without going out to get it.
We ordered Paneer Pakora, Butter Chicken, Shrimp Dansak, Basmati Rice, Sag Paneer, Nan bread, and some papadams. We enjoyed all the food, so when my birthday rolled around last week we ordered some of the same items but also tried Tandoori Shrimp, a Vegetable Curry, and Vegetable Biryani. I really loved the flavor of all the dishes, the spicing was spot on, and we savored every drop of sauce in all the dishes. My only complaint would be, as some others have noticed, that there seems to be a tendency to small portion sizes for some items. However everyone was courteous and I'm elated to be able to have quality Indian food delivered again."}

{"text":"Very delicious! Portions are \"small\" compared to what you would expect. But I think that's more endearing since you have just enough to be full and don't feel like a whale. I had the chicken biryani-- sooo good. My vegan friend had the vegetable curry which was only alright. Sort of tasted like vegetable soup. 
The service was excellent and the ambiance was pleasing. Overrall I had a good experience."}
{"text":"As with others, we found the portions here truly wanting. We got takeout: butter chicken, lamb bhoona and spinach paneer, plus one rice and one naan came to about 42 dollars before tip. When we got home we found that the takeout pans were not even close to full; for 11-12 dollars per entree the portions at, e.g. Bombay Mahal or Punjab Palace are far more substantial. 

The butter chicken and paneer were way too sweet and the naan wasn't very fresh. I suppose the sweet butter chicken (with raisins and almonds) and paneer (a lot more yellow and saucy than I'm used to) could be due to different regional variants; it was not to my taste at all, but your mileage may vary. The inexcusable part was that it included 7 small pieces of chicken. We counted. 7. Sitting lonely in a shallow bath of sickly sweet sauce.

The lamb bhoona wasn't all that bad, just small (and the sauce was a little thin for my liking), but my girlfriend was so unsatisfied with the butter chicken that she made herself a grilled cheese sandwich instead.

Save your money, go over to any of the many excellent Indian restaurants at Jean-Talon at Acadie (or the Bombay Mahal Express at St-Laurent and des Pins). This place is not worth what they charge. I will absolutely not be going back here, ever."}
