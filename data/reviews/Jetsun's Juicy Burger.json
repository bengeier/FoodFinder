{"text":"Decent enough for a fast food joint. Same set up as Harvey's. Although the meat is slightly better. Soggy fries."}
{"text":"Compared to McDonald's and Wendy's, yes, notches up.

For where I live, best burger joint by default."}
{"text":"Hits the spot, not fancy or pretentious just a nice burger joint but get the standard fares. Done of their home brew foods lack seasoning or quality. Pountine is good"}
{"text":"My teenage boys frequently done at Jetsuns. They love the homemade burgers at Jetsuns. The food is delicious and very generous portions. The kitchen was very clean and organized as well. The service was exceptionally good. The young man at the grill took real good care of us. My son tried the Philly cheese steak,  a new item on their menu and gave it a definite thumbs up!!  I highly recommend Jetsuns Juicy Burgers great establishment. They even cater now. Fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went with two other friends, they screwed up all of the orders. My buddy ordered a shake with his meal and got it 20 minutes after finishing eating. Food was mediocre , burgers were over cooked, fries were soggy. Overall horrible experience."}
{"text":"If I have a choice, I would leave ZERO star.

First, the food there was totally TASTELESS... and the onion rings were just COVERED with oil..... supper soggy... to the point that I used napkins to blot ALL of the oil from ALL pieces of onion rings that I had.... so its flat.. and I think it tasted better than the OIL because now I actually can taste the onion!!!!!!!!!!

anyways, I ordered the combo, and asked the cashier girl if I can substitute onion rings with the fries... and she says sure.

I didn't realize this until I was walking but she CHARGED me each one separately..... like veggie burger, onion ring, and the pop...so she overcharged me.. basically. 

anyhow, my veggie burger was just plain tasteless.... very very soggy for some reason... and the person who was grilling the patty wore no gloves and handled the patty with bare hands.......

its just BAD.... NEVER HAD THIS BADDDDDDDDDDD BURGER before in my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE... I SWEAR..

plus its over-priced.... next time, I will just go to BK, McD or A&W...
their services are much better and staff are polite than those at jetsun's... the staffs at jetsun's are just SO not polite.... kinda scary in a way........

NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"What can I say about this little burger joint? 

Jetsun's advertises that their burgers are made fresh daily - I highly doubt that. 

Even the hamburger buns were cold with a smudge of grease on top - Probably why they aren't advertising fresh hamburger buns. 

The burger itself was large in portion. The onion rings we got on the side was slightly burnt. Soft drinks are self serve with standard options. 

There was one person working as both cashier and cook, so service was pretty slow. You can imagine that the place isn't the cleanest when that poor woman has no help at all. Tables were left dirty with bits of burger and hamburger crumbs; the floors also need a mopping. Every time a customer walks in the store, a gust of freezing wind would blow into the store, so keep your jackets on if you're dining in. 

They do have specials - complimentary mushrooms and onion toppings - and mini burger options, but would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone is comparing this place to Lick's when Lick's is far superior than Jetsun's.

Jetsun's serves what I can just make at home. The burgers are extremely dry. And the buns ... Oh man, it's ALWAYS burnt to a crisp. (i've been here 4 times by the way)

The only good thing about this place is their fries, and that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm a fan of a good home-made tasting burger and this place definitely hits the spot. I like their ice cream too, (99 cents in the summer for a hefty single scoop!) Love this joint, will go again."}
{"text":"Being in the area, my husband and I went there for lunch on Saturday.
The decor is nice. Diner style ambiente with pretty colors.

As for the food:
We both had the Juicyburger Combo ($8.84) with cheese (+$1).
He switched his pop for orange juice (+$0.68). With tax in the total was ca. $24, which is a bit pricey for my taste. 
Luckily we came with TeamBuy vouchers.

As for the food quality and the service: I was a bit disappointed.

First we had to wait quite some time for the burgers cause the guy at the grill didn't get it to work. They told me they have issues to get the temperature right... Uhm, ok. 
So the first batch of patties turned black and to coal and he had to put on a second batch for which we had to wait. That created a lineup in the store.
Because of the long wait, our fries had already been ready and sitting on the tablet for while. One of the guys came and took them away, saying I would get new ones. I appreciated the thought, but when our burgers were finally ready as well, one of his colleagues just took our old fries, threw them into the frier and then gave them back to us. 
They looked pretty disgusting to be honest. So I complained and we got new ones. Unfortunately those weren't that tasty either but at least they were fresh.
About the burger: It was alright. Nothing to write home about, but alright. My husband enjoyed his burger a bit more though to be fair.

Will I go back? I don't think so..."}
{"text":"Ten dollars for a very good burger, mushy fries, and a small pop in a paper cup makes Jetsun's the best choice for burgers in a suburban Walmart parking lot. If you're willing to forego the Scarborough parking lot ambiance, there are many better choices in Toronto."}
{"text":"**Update** Their chicken burgers seemed to have gotten smaller. The chicken filet used to so big that the buns don't cover it 100%. Now their buns more than cover the entire chicken filet. It's still pretty juicy but the dryness of the buns somewhat ruined it. So I no longer have a reason to come here.

**

Burgers are hard to screw up. You take a patty and grill it. Then you put it on a bun and add toppings. So the question is really: a) What is the quality of the meat? and b) Do the cooks know how to not over/under cook? The answer is a) pretty good and b) yes the cooks do a decent job. 

In particular, I like their chicken burgers. The chicken is more juicy than other places. I had South Street Burger and the chicken burger was dry as sand. But I think that was the cook's fault because I felt he left it on the grill for too long. Jetsun's chicken burger has never disappointed me. Furthermore, I like whatever they are using to season the chicken. South Street's chicken burger barely has any taste if I add no condiments. 

My only complaints are the prices and the buns. The buns don't feel fresh. The prices seem really steep. But with so many burger joints around GTA, even small differences can spell doom. I generally don't eat burgers anyways and Jetsun's is not going to be my first choice."}
{"text":"I have never been to the North York location but I have been to the Warden/Eglinton one. I have mixed feelings on this place.  The first few times we went here it was phenomenal! Unfortunately it has slowly went downhill since. When they first opened it was great, they took pride in their food and you could see that they were proud to be serving it. My husband and I always get the juicy with cheese we usually share a large fry and both get a diet coke. It is quite expensive for what you get and they don't have a massive selection. When we have been there lately there has been teenagers running the place and it shows. Loud music, shady characters at the tables and repeating your order is never fun. 
We have taken quite a few people here from out of town and they seem to really like it the first time but the second and third time it wares off.
I hope they go back to the service of when they first opened."}
{"text":"Cadillac Combo [with bacon & cheese]
Regular Fries + Soft Drink

Good char-caramelization effects visually on the Patty.
I expected hint of Pink.  There's a note on the table about, Pinkness.
I just wished the Pinkness impact on the Patty made it better.
First time eating such a Patty and the texture wasn't appealing.  
Good outer texture, completely MUSHY mess inside.

Maybe there is clientele that prefer this style of preparation.
Maybe my Patty was a one off.  
Maybe other reviewers can explain better.
Not for me."}
{"text":"Dec 3, 2010 7:40PM at 5165 Yonge Street location. I order a Juicy Burger, the meat was badly burn. Onion and lettice was not fresh. Onion in one of the containers was dis-colored.

The worst part, there were 10 teenages playing some tile game. More kids came in but they did not buy anthing, they just join their friends. They were shouting and they scare me and my son. Employee did not do anything about these kids.  They need a professional manager to run this place."}
{"text":"I don't have much to add that the FTR poster said already. The Juicy Burger combo comes to $9.99 with tax. The burger and fries were piping hot. The patty was quite delicious. The toppings are your Harvey's standards. I'd like to have seen some more exotic topping choices. The place seemed to lack a/c which would have been nice.

If you want to get a burger up in North York that's not Wendy's, Jetsun's is probably your option. I can't see it being worth anyone's trek up to North York."}
{"text":"Jetsun's is just another burger joint, doesn't stand out from the rest of them although it is better then going to the nearby Wendy's. 
The burger is your average sloppy, thrown together burger with the usual bland toppings. 
The combos are ridiculously priced for the food you receive, but who am I kidding, this isn't a fancy restaurant; just a burger joint.
They could however go a little easy on the pocket if they wanna survive against the neighbour Wendy's."}
{"text":"Burgers are yummy...uncooked burnt burgers...that's another story (and a skill in itself)

NEW LOCATION
so me checking out the Metro saw an ad for a $2 Jetsun's burger to celebrate its new location. $2 for a hamburger? well sure!

now if only one could find the place...that would be a good start. The location of this joint is a little hidden. I had to drive passed twice just to find it. It's across the street from the old City TV building. The only thing is that it's inside of another building. It's kind of like it's in a mall except this mall has no other vendors.

ATTENDANCE
Well for such a cheap price, I thought I would be waiting a long time for a burger.  Fortunately or Unfortunately (depending on whether you're on the side of the customer or owner), I was able to walk right up to the cash and order w/o having to wait in any line.  That was kind of a bad sign. Did the public know something that I didn't know? Why wasn't there anyone else there? It could have been b/c it was spitting a bit during the evening and it scared off all potential customers...but that's only a \"could be\".

BURGER
So my friend and I each had a burger. It tasted pretty good until I had my 3rd bite. I said hey... why is my burger all red inside! My burger was RAW still. RAW?! how?!  I stopped eating it right there and then b/c I didn't want to get sick.

My friend's burger was fine. He ate his.

My friend and I talked afterwards and he exclaimed \"didn't you notice the cook tossing away a dozen burgers or so? he was screwing up royally!\". 

Yes this is a new business and yes there is a learning curve.  I just don't want to be the guinea pig in this learning process."}
{"text":"This is actually the second location, but I haven't been to the first, so this one gets to be on yelp first, go figure.

The best way I can describe Jetsun's is that it is just a burger joint.  That's not a knock, because Jetsun's makes a pretty solid burger.

The burger is a nice fresh ground beef burger that's a good size, grilled fresh and topped with the usual condiments you'd find at a burger joint.    The sides are again the usual; fries, onion rings and poutine.  And that's pretty much it.

I don't actually have anything against Jetsun's, in fact it is exactly what I'd expect from a burger joint.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I don't think you'll be disappointed by going, but there are other burger places nearby that I prefer.

I must mention though that they serve Kawartha's ice cream in scoops or in a shake, which is just fantastic."}
{"text":"Jetsun's Juicy Burger is a convenient burger place near my work that is a notch up from the local Wendy's.  It has an old-school diner feel and the burgers are made from thick non-frozen meat patties.  The poutines with cheese curds and gravy are okay too.  My opinion of the poutine is that the cheese curds are not melted enough by the gravy.

It is not a top-notch burger place, but when I am craving a juicy burger during work-hours it's alright.  The people behind the counter are friendly.  I just don't go here often because it takes forever to get an order out and waiting in line and smelling the stench of the opened washroom door was kind of gross."}
{"text":"I was a around this area and wanted to try a restaurant that I've never been to so I decided to give this place a try. There was a special deal going on - $2.99 for a burger. I decided to build my own burger - beef patty, sautéed onions, mushrooms, bacon and cheese. It was good! Was it the best burger I've ever had? No. But it definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This was once a good burger joint, no longer!
Did Management change? It now sucks! Don't waste your hard earned money here, for a good burger experience try south street."}
{"text":"We went here because we were in the area plus we had a coupon from the entertainment book. Bad idea! We ordered 1 juicy burger each & shared a regular order of fries, some onion rings & two small iced teas. Total bill came to about $15.24. 

The burgers were so-so. Kinda greasy for my taste. Hubby said the area where they had the condiments there were fruit flies buzzing around. Cover your food for heaven's sake if you're going to leave the door open! Yuck. Fries were also greasy & dark in colour. They also tasted old. Like they'd been cut a while ago & then left out a while before cooking them.  We were pretty disappointed at the quality of food. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was utterly disappointed with the food at Jetsun's. I tried the hot dog and it was very much comparable to the average street dog, and it only costed $10 (with combo)!!! The fries were soggy and tasteless. Maybe the \"juicy burger\" will be less disappointing."}
{"text":"How did I end up in Jetsun's Juicy Burger?? Since I don't know where to go for dinner so I decided to: 

Get off North York Centre Subway Station... and go up to ground level, exit turn right..and just go in the first restaurant... 

Should I be glad that I am not eating at a \"House of Chen's\" Canadian Chinese restaurants? or I might be eating at a dark seedy place full of interesting characters? But I am at Yonge/Finch not Jane/Finch... 

I was trying to kill my Yelp friend with Cadillac Burger with bacon and cheese... and myself with a Mini Juicy Burger which they were out and I was upgraded for free with a regular burger.. Maybe they want to kill me too? 

Untrained staffs were slow and kept messing up everyone orders..and took forever to even start cooking my order!  They asked me 3 times what I ordered... I should have told them something different every time to mess them up more! CP24 was on......... CP24 keeping some people entertained while I giving nasty looks to those staffs...

The patties were cooked with a hint of pink inside... not really usual at other burger joints I been to.... the toppings were kind of boring and standard.. I expect more gourmet toppings with the prices Jetsun's are charging! 

I don't like the buns, I don't like the toppings, I don't think I like Jetsun's.. 


Now next time, I will say turn LEFT and go in the third restaurant and wondering what it would be?"}
{"text":"Everything about my subsequent visit to this place was stunningly disappointing. It was downright comical actually. They were still honouring their $2 burger deal, so I couldn't resist. Late on a weeknight however, the service apparently goes down a few notches. My laundry list of \"quibbles\":

- The sole server, whom I'll call Burger Girl (BG) was sitting under the communal table when I approached and had to rush quickly to her post behind the counter
- BG literally threw the burgers (like meat frisbees) on to the grill.
- BG's BF was in the back with her waiting for her to finish her shift.
- BG popped a few of the burger toppings into her mouth in plain sight.
- The burger took over 15 minutes to grill. WTF.
- BG's BF's hat was cocked to an absurd angle. Nothing to do with the burgers but this annoyed me.

This is all too bad because for a ramshackle shop in a terrible location with mediocre food, they can't really afford to have lousy service. And eating food off the line? I shan't return."}
{"text":"Felt like going for some burgers today for lunch.  And being at work really limits your options.  Time and location was kinda key... sad I know.  So I decided to drop by Jetsun's Burger around the North York Centre corporate area.  Walked in and this is your typical diner type feel.  You get some funky colours going on and you can feel the greasiness slowly but surely settling into your clothes.  I quickly ordered the Cadillac Combo which was pretty expensive for lunch outta the dt core area.  I decided to dress my burger with ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles.  The burgers are freshly grilled when ordered so it took a little while for them to be ready.

Got my burger, fries and coke and sat down.  I ended up sharing a table with some other corporate folks as seating was a little limited, but no biggie.  I ate a couple of fries and they were still covered with oil.  For me, I like my fries a little bit more crispy than being just lightly fried.  I believe if they were deep fried for just a little bit longer it would have made a major difference.  But then again it was the lunch rush hour, so speed was definitely a factor in service today.   

I took a bite into my burger and right away, not bad.  The patty's seasoned well and it still maintains its juiciness (or grease?).  Do note, it was a little greasy and there was a fair amount of oil spots all over the paper wrapping.  The burger felt like your typical diner burger.  I'm fine with it being greasy and all, heck sometimes my body just craves this.  So for the health conscience, be warned.  

Overall, I would say Jetsusn's burger is a little bit better than the average, but not by much.  For the health conscience, I would say go for W Burger Bar as they serve many more 'healthier' options.  Jetsun's is a diner type burger.  You wouldn't go to McD's and expect to find gourmet burger with organic patties.  Same mindset with Jetsun's but for this price... I'll have to pass.  Maybe in the past I wouldn't say this but with Toronto's burger scene getting better and better, go out and try others."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the quality of the burger and fries. Over-cooked, tasteless, too greasy, leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and a bad feeling in your tummy. 

Even if you passed by it and was starving, keep on walking by and just get a slice from Pizza Pizza. I do NOT recommend this place."}
