{"text":"Maybe the best tacos in Vegas, but definitely the best (and only?) handmade gorditas in town. I highly, highly recommend the pastor gorditas.  The tacos are also very good - check out the \"giro\" tacos (carve asada with grilled onions and guac). My favorite taco might be their birria, which sadly isn't part of their regular menu. But when it's available, I always eat at least three."}
{"text":"I love this taco shop. It's fresh made to order. And it's just not tacos! They have mushrooms quesadillas, and Nopales! (Cactus). Just like my moms home cooking. I love, love, love Pos Pa que Takos!"}
{"text":"We've been here at least four times in the last two weeks and I love this little place! My husband gets the vegetarian tacos and I get the Al pastor. Always delicious, fresh and so good. The owners are super nice, too and that goes a long way with us. I want to try the carne asada, but the al pastor always calls to me. Someday..."}
{"text":"This is the best food truck around!!! My family is now a customer for life!!! The takos were ridiculous!!! Soooo delicious!!!!!  The mulitas were on point and the fish takos were the bomb!!!!! Sonja rocked the food for us and we will definitely be back and will most certainly be telling everyone we know about her!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A late night taco food truck that just hits it out of the park !!    How could a taco taste so good? It's not just the cooking and ingredients it is the LOVE and PASSION added to the preparation.  
Look, $2.00 for tacos prepared to perfection.  I ordered the chicken tacos ( chose to come off pork for a while , a tough decision ) and whilst enjoying my tacos I spied the Mushroom tacos on the menu. Those sounds good I thought out loud, The next thing I know the lady working the truck came out with a big smile and a freshly prepared mushroom taco on the house  !! .. Dove in with gusto, looking up between bites, caught the chefs eye who was watching my diligently. With all the dignity I could muster whilst mushrooms and taco fillings were overflowing onto my fingers and face I gave a Big thank you and two thumbs up.
 These Guys are sending love into the  world one bite at a time. Here is the kicker, When you visit, and if you are reading this you will very soon,  pay for an extra taco and ask them pay it forward to the next customer. It's fun a way to continue sharing the love this super couple (thinking husband and wife ) are dropping into downtown."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Great menu fast service!!!!
I found my taco place when I come to Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here and I'm glad we did! The mushroom tacos are so delicious. Everything is made fresh. The people that work here are so nice. Everyone needs to check it out."}
{"text":"If you've never eaten a fresh gordita, you are seriously missing out! You have to taste their homemade deliciousness! I have often lamented about the quality of Vegas' Mexican food offerings, and this place offers exactly what I've been craving all these years.  Thank you!  I've been there four times in the last two weeks and can't seem to get enough.  My husband loves the birria takos (not always on the menu), I'm addicted to the al pastor gordita and gyros takos, and the cactus mulita is tastier than you'd expect.  We haven't had anything we don't like yet."}
{"text":"On the Southwest corner of Charleston & 14th sits a small taco stand run by two very nice young ladies. 
And well I experienced:
THE BEST BURRITO I've ever had. My asada burrito had to weigh in at over one pound. But it would still be the best at half the size. The meat was very flavorful and in an appropriate ratio to beans & rice. Ad the green hot salsa and magic happens."}
{"text":"I ordered seven steak tacos, lots of steak, onion/cilantro, and cabbage. The xtra hot salsa was an amazing kiss to my taco, I started to sweat from the heat. And the bean and cheese burrito was delicious."}
{"text":"Don't be like my wife and get freaked out by the somewhat sketchy parking lot of the mini-mart where this taco truck resides.  Sure there are often interesting people hanging out in front of the store, but nobody has every bothered me the 4 times I been there, often late at night. My son goes to LVA which is nearby, so its the perfect place to go after his performances or when in the downtown Vegas area.

Their tacos cause such happiness and bliss to happen in my mouth and tummy. I have not yet made it through every taco option offered, but am getting close. My favorites so far are the tongue, cheek, mushroom, and carnitas. Lovely spicy salsas, and frothy tasty horchata. And such nice and friendly owners. If only I lived closer, this would be my regular happy spot, and I would likely be fatter and have the best onion breath!"}
{"text":"This is a great little taco stand, flavors were on point and the ladies working there are awesome.  Why not five stars?  Only because of the quality of the meat... don't get me wrong it's delicious but it's not the best I've ever had.  If I could give 4 1/4 stars, that'd be about right.  Which is very respectable, I must say."}
{"text":"Great service , delicious , clean home made food . Salsas are  full of flavor and not water down. I had the the steak tacos perfectly cooked steak with fresh guacamole and grilled onions also had the cactus tacos so good you won't miss the meat if your a vegetarian. Yummy  !"}
{"text":"If you're craving some bomb.com food, this is the place to be. I was greeted with smiles and extremely wonderful service. Everything is affordable and made-to-order, with lightning speed! I highly recommend this place if you're craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to drive past it, and made a spontaneous decision to stop. And we were glad we did. This is truly the \"street-style\" experience. The food is sooo good (have realistic expectations, people seem to expect everything to be out of this world). Anyhow, great food and very cost-effective! I think this place has the potential to become a Vegas staple."}
{"text":"I will keep it simple. The food is DELICIOUS! Everything is fresh and flavorful, and the prices are cheap. Unfortunatel they are only open 4p to 10p, so get your grub on before you go out."}
{"text":"Great  place to grab a quick bite and really enjoy authentic Mexican food made fresh!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a chicharrón taco and a bowl of pozole, both were absolutely outstanding. The taco was full of VERY spicy chicharrón complete with a tender interior and crispy edges. The pozole was some of the best I have ever had, multiple layers of complex flavors simmered to perfection. This place is a great addition to the taco trail that has emerged along East Charleston."}
{"text":"Was craving tacos so went to Yelp for some help and found Pos Paque. Wow they didn't dissapoint! Had their asada tacos and al pastor mulitas both meats were delicious. Great food and great service."}
