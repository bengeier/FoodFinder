{"text":"First time experimenting with Indo food and it was not that bad. Its inside a supermarket that sells a bunch of stuff like bread the size of your body for 75 cents!!! Anyways, that's where this Indo joint is. You see their menu posted on top with no pricing listed at all. We decided to order quite a few things family style. 

Beef Rendang: Suppose to be tender beef with sauce. The sauce was sweet like, but we got this dish cold and they reheated it. The beef is a bit tough, so I imagine its frozen meat.

Fried Fish: This is ordinary fried fish...Nothing to explain really.

Goat Curry: The curry was very watery, and the goat was alright. I'm not one to enjoy goat really, so this dish was a fail to me.

Chicken Satay in Peanut Sauce: This was probably the highlight dish of the day. 10 skewers for $15! 

Mind you, the family is very polite and nice and brought tea knowing that the up-stair seating environment is quite cold. The price I paid at the end didn't really justify the food we were eating.

I also bought their Crispy Jerky for $8. It was really crispy and no flavour really.

I'm glad to at least try out Indo food. It is quite pricey, for the few dishes b/c its family style, I ended up paying $60+! They minus one of the dish b/c it was cold, so that is a nice gesture on their end. And considering that its not a restaurant, their service was fine as well.

They let you eat first, then pay later."}
{"text":"I called them today. They're CLOSED FOR BUSINESS right now. But Agnes, the lady I spoked to, said that they are looking for a new place for them to set shop.

WAITING!"}
{"text":"Warung Kampung inside JD's Market serves Indonesian food as what a mother would had made it for you with love and care.

Beef Rendang+Kale+Rice ($7)
Pepes - Grilled King Fish in Banana Leaf ($8)
Sate Ayam - Chicken Satay in Peanut Sauce ($1.50) 

A little on the pricey side as the portion is small, of course compare to eating in Indonesia, but this maybe the closest I can get in Toronto. The spices used is quite unique and flavourable.

A takeout place only...or you can just eat in the street... as it is street food after all!

Ask for their house made Green Chili Sauce... it is really spicy!!

They also takes orders for Rijsttafel (rice table) if you want to host a Indonesian feast at home!"}
{"text":"I totally share Darren's excitement that there's finally a place serving real authentic Indonesian food. Wahoo! I came out on opening weekend and found  a good gathering of people already in front of her setup, mostly other Indonesians who had heard of this through word of mouth. After ordering, you can make your way up to the 2nd floor mezzanine and they'll bring up the food when it's ready. It was pretty chilly up there on my last visit as it's poorly-insulated. I hope they can do something about it as the weather gets even colder. In the meantime, you can warm up by chowing down on the delicious food.

Having been there twice now, I've really enjoyed the majority of items I've had a chance to try. They are from Central Java and so the food is really familiar to me. You can order a 4-item tray for $8 or an extra dollar for each extra item (I believe). Prices include tax. I would go for the kale, beef rendang, sate ayam, kambing, .. ok, I recommend everything in their hot tray except maybe not the eggplant, which I found lacking flavour and chewy. 

If you are wondering why it is served as a hot tray item rather than prepared after you order, it is because Indonesian food takes a damn long time to cook and, in general, you can't just whip up a dish in 10 mins. Many items are cooked for hours with a plethora of spices or take multiple steps to put together (boil, roast, then cook with other stuff, then shred etc). 

I was able to try their weekend special last week : soto ayam!!! (This is my favourite dish in the world btw) So if you see this item when you visit, I highly recommend it. Just a note on how we eat it - dump the rice into the bowl of soup and mix!
Oh, one more note to re-iterate another one of Darren's points - don't miss out on the chili!"}
