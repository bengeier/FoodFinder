{"text":"Poster says 2 slices 1 pop, it does not say anything else. But when I went to buy it, they charged me an extra dollar saying the price is only for pepperoni pizza.  They have misleading advertising, and the poster even has a lady eating pizza with vegetables on it. We will not be returning here.  Pizza is overcooked with no flavour and very little toppings."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Hardly any cheese and the crust seems premade. A bit overcooked and bland. Can't say I will be back as there are big box stores that make better pizza.

Hard to know what else to write other than it is unremarkable."}
{"text":"There are a lot of pizza places in Georgetown and Joe's is IMO the best because of the base sauce.  I have walked in for a slice and its under $3 pretty good pizza.  I have also ordered the XL 3 topping walk in special with EXTRA sauce always, and this pizza becomes GREAT!"}
