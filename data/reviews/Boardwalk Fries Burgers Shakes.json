{"text":"We have been waiting for the day we could try what we thought could potentially be a little gem close to our house. That day was yesterday and well, we were more than a little disappointed. 

First impressions are good with the place being new, clean and quite cute inside. But... you know what they say about 'lipstick'. 

We got a huge shock when we ordered since we paid almost $30 for two 'classic' burgers (their most basic burger), shared chili cheese fries and a shared drink. What??? This is still fast food, right? At this price we were really hoping for some great food. Nope. 

My burger was dry and the bun was saturated with some sort of 'secret' sauce (they should probably keep this secret to themselves). I was going to take it back but my Hubs offered to switch with me. The chili cheese fries were bland and tasteless with the cheese looking like someone boiled 'no name' cheese slices in water.

The most intelligent thing the owners have done is set up business across from the high school. Kids don't care if they are getting snowed, can't tell quality and need a place to loiter.

Just an FYI, this is a chain fast food restaurant not a locally owned place as we had assumed."}
{"text":"Despite the poor reviews I thought I would give this place a try...  It was good but nothing super special. I ordered a basic burger and fries. The prices aren't \"fast food\" prices, but really aren't crazy as suggested by other reviewers. The burger was fresh and seasoned just right with a soft tasty bun and adequate toppings. The fries were ok... similar to Five Guys... The kind where you eat every single one in the container but then afterwards you wonder if they were worth all the calories :). Theres a good atmosphere (Saturday afternoon) and staff was friendly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the peanut butter milkshake!! To die for! The Hawaiian burger is amazing."}
{"text":"New ownership. Service is terrible now. The counter staff doesn't take orders correctly. The owner takes no responsibility. The word \"sorry\" doesn't seem to exist in this place."}
{"text":"First off, OH THE MILKSHAKES ARE SO GOOD
But the Burgers or only ok, I would rate it a 4, but I wasnt really blown away. I mean its worth trying but not worth tracking across the city for"}
{"text":"Not a great burger, mediocre fries, long waits. 

For my money is rather go to Five Guys for a better burger and fries. 

It's not a staff issue, I guess I just don't like this chain and their food."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Went in on opening morning at 11:30. Ordered a chocolate shake and an avocado bacon burger. The shake was promptly delivered to my table. Small and watery for $5.49. A few mins later my burger arrived. Looks quite plain on the large tray without fries, and I would expect more do the over $15 I spent on a quick lunch. 

Burger was ok. Lots of avocado, but disappointed with the rubbery texture of the two quite small beef patties. ($9.49 for a double burger, $7.49 for single patty)

As I was eating all the school kids from across the street piled in, huge line and terribly loud. Hopefully they have success with the school age population as my odds of returning are low."}
{"text":"Too bad about all the terrible reviews! I've had decent food here several times, we order and pick up. I like the burgers, they are better than average for sure. Their regular poutine is really good! I'm from Quebec, the land of epic poutine, and man Calgary poutine sucks! This place is good though, feels like a little taste of home. 

I wouldn't say it blows me away, hence the 3 star review, but I've never been disappointed. Large portions, fresh food, friendly service, good topping and sauce selection. The patties could be a little thicker, to compete with 5 Guys, but overall it's A ok!"}
