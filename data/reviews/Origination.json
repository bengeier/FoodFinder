{"text":"So I went to dinner tonight and was reading review about if I checked in on yelp that I will get a chilled noodle.  So I told one of the girl server whose english wasn't very good that I checked into yelp and she said she doesn't know then ran off to the back.  I assumed that she put my chilled noodle in.  Then when our order came, I asked the server (guy) whose English was better about the chilled noodle dish, then he said it was only for afternoon.  It didn't say anything about afternoon on yelp at all so I was sort of disappointed.  The service was so slow but we were just for the food only.  The restaurant was busy and only 2 servers taking orders.   The food was quite tasty.  Minus one star for the washroom being out of service.  Seriously?? So your staff don't need to go to washroom."}
{"text":"Expensive and same order with different ingredients often happen,they just put whatever food materials they have for the day."}
{"text":"Simply 5 star Chinese YunNan rice noodle place. Reasonable price with amazing taste."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this restaurant as it opened recently near our workplaces. The restaurant has a homey feel with its eclectic collection of cute cutlery and tabletop items. Their seats are also quite comfortable, especially with the pillow cushions.  We tried the beef shank appetizer, beef stew noodle, and cutepot rice noodle. The beef shank portion was quite small and tasted suspiciously of just store-bought roast beef slices, but the peanut butter sauce was quite delicious. The main dishes came in colorful and hot claypots, with the contents still boiling/steaming. The beef stew noodle soup was very flavourful and they were generous with the noodle portions. Sadly, one of the pieces of beef had no meat on it and was just cartilage that hadn't been stewed long enough to be edible. I would recommend you eat the noodle soup very quickly because the noodles ended up soaking up all the broth. The cutepot rice noodle broth is a bit spicy, but not intolerable. The noodles were too soggy though, and the noodle-to-meat ratio was too high.   We saw some interesting menu items that people at other tables ordered, such as the Origination Yunnan rice noodle and kung fu tea. Nevertheless based on the food items we tried today, I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Origination has nice concept and comfy ambiance.  They specialized in Yunnan cross bridge noodle where they put all the topics and ingredients in from of you and then add them into stone piping hot stove at the end.  I don't know much about Yunnan cross bridge noodle soup but it's good to give it a try. Ordered a hot savoury noodle soup and I add extra chilly sauce in it.  The flavour is quite flavourful and spicy with lots of spice, it's a good flavour for a hot summer day.  The freshness and cutlery of ingredient are well presented. However, what let the overall experience down is the overall service.  It's unenthusiastic and slow.  For a Chinatown eatery I normally don't care much about it, but their price point is pricier than the places nearby.  Not to mention lack of protein.  It does have sufficient amount of noodle tho. Overall a solid meal, I'd have graded higher had the service been a little warmer.  I might visit again in the future but probably not very frequent as there are many other alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the place is not very clean. The cup is not washed, there are sticky stains on the outside of the cup(possibly coke) and the table is not very clean neither."}
{"text":"For a Chinatown restaurant, they had above average service (the waitresses were attentive and nice) and all the cutleries were in sets (no broken edges on their bowls and plates either).  The food tasted good, impressive load of condiments and nice presentation of the food as well.   Would go back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm love the Origination noodles where they bring everything separately and put it altogether in front of you. I get cravings. Decent price too. Would be an easy 5 stars if only the service was better - they tend to be fairly nonchalant and not the most attentive. But it's clean, delicious, and decently priced. Will be going back often! Also, they have a Vicinity card so you can collect points and free stuff. 10% off with cash."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! It's the best place in town if you wanna have some EXCELLENT food. The staff was friendly and helpful. The place was clean and well decorated. Most important, the Yunnan rice noodle was soooooooo delicious!!! Just like what I had in Yunnan!!! It's the best restaurant you  ABSOLUTELY MUST go!"}
{"text":"Good price for ALOT of food (free noodle refills!)  Highly recommend the beef stir fry noodles (I forgot the actual menu name) and the tofu mixed noodles! The little cart with extra condiments is great for adjusting the flavors to your liking :D"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me. I forgot which Chinese province the noodles dishes originate from, but they provided a good change of pace from typical Chinese restaurants.  The broths are quite complex and have unique flavours to them. A lot more pickled ingredients than the average place. During your meal, they provide a cart which contains a variety of delicious condiments. Each dish was only between $9 - 11 which is very reasonable. Good portion sizes as well."}
{"text":"This is best rice noodle I had , the taste is amazing and love it. Need to improve in service , overall experience is good"}
{"text":"I've been here twice trying out different dishes. I recommend their tofu rice noodle and the chilled shredded chicken appetizer. The tofu rice noodle reminds me of Chinese black bean noodles with tofu. It's not too spicy so you can customize the spice level and the overall flavour with the condiments provided. The chilled shredded chicken appetizer was fabulous! It has a crunchy texture from the cucumbers but soft from the shredded chicken. I suspect they put a little Sichuan peppercorn oil in the dressing.  The spicy and sour rice noodle soup is mehhh... I have had better at Dagu Rice Noodle (which is basically the same concept).  The prices are decent and you get 5% discount if you pay by cash."}
{"text":"Would do 4 stars for the food, but only 2 stars for now just because of their extremely bad service.   Usually you get to see a chinese guy in his 50s coming out of the kitchen, and he is good.   However, the young woman at the front literally made me giggle, that something you'd only expect from bad YouTube acting (entitled: asian restaurants vs. western restaurants) suddenly shows up in real life. Her poker face, gives you water without even looking at you.   I didn't say anything, because the weather was hot and I had my plans for the day. No intentions whatever to ruin a perfect sunny time, ended up giving her tips just to be polite. Tho, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night   Pros  -Good service  - Family Style ambiance  - well priced   Cons - Food was average"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. Came here for dinner with a friend and ordered the rice noodle with beef. It came in a cute pot, and portion of beef was decent. Noodles were cooked well, not too soggy and overall the whole dish was tasty. Nothing exceptional, but still tasty. I do really appreciate the thoughtfulness of the restaurant though. I remember on the table there was a decision chart to help you decide on a dish to order. I do hope to return to try one of their more interesting dishes/ teas though like their tofu rice noodle. If you have a chinese noodle craving on a cold winter day, definitely give origination a try!"}
{"text":"3 stars only?!! Com'on...when you enter an asian restaurant and you are the only western...2 options: food is gonna be really weird so be ready or it is a hidden gem...in this case second option hands down. Just look the pic and take your conclusion. Amaaaaaziiing!!! Cheap and super authentic. Sorry first option too...i ordered the dessert...sweet lotus seed with white fungus. Made of a white fungus that grows in trees. What an amazing place!!! Delicious. Still the only western, been here for an hour now."}
{"text":"Very interesting noodle place in Chinatown. Prides itself on Yunnan style noodles and broths made from scratch. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and after a disappointing show at the AGO this seemed like the ticket. We wanted to do hotpot but decided to try here instead.   Nice noodle soups like the \"Crossing the Bridge\" came with things to add to the soup. Also a large selection of condiments came with each soup."}
{"text":"Ordered this off uber eats, once again a nice Asian restaurant in the heart of China town that exceeds expectations. I got the spicy beef broth rice noodle and it came with beef shank. The shank was really tender and the broth had amazing flavour. I would definitely recommend this place during cold Canadian weather. One thing I would say is that the soup is on the oily side."}
{"text":"I have my go-to ramen noodle, viet noodle and korean noodle places, but no Chinese noodle place downtown so I thought I give this place a try.  I read on the menu the option for noodle: rice noodle or noodle. When I asked the server what type of noodle is \"noodle\", she looked confused. I thought it was a silly question and expected a response like \"oh, it's egg noodle, udon noodle or vermicelli.\" After providing her with examples like instant noodle or egg noodle, she responded egg noodle. I wasn't confident in her response so I just stuck with rice noodle. Afterwards, she was prompt in providing extra napkins and refilling our water when needed so that was nice.  As for the food, I order the marinated pork hock rice noodle. The dish was flavourful and the pork hock was nicely marinated. My main feedback is more meaty pieces for the pork hock and a better balance of the oil in the dish. I know pork hock can be oily and depends how you cook it, but the oil was very noticeably in the dish. It would probably be good for them to recommend a pu'er tea to help cleanse the system of the oil while eating.   Overall, it's not bad, but not amazing. I might go back to try their signature dish, but this place is not going on my go-to noodle list."}
{"text":"Got the Crossing-the-Bridge noodle soup ??????, after seeing another table having their noodle bowl prepared in front of them and asking the staff what they ordered.  It was an entertaining experience.  Soup had a lot of flavor, and they bring you a cart full of various condiments including preserved vegetables, garlic, hot chili, MSG, and so on. So if the flavor isn't enough, you have a lot of options available.  The bowls are very hot, so avoid burning yourself. While they do not warn you in advance, please exercise caution and/or common sense.  It's pretty good for $11.90 10% off if you pay cash. They've also got a yelp check-in special for a side of chilled noodles."}
{"text":"Pretty solid restaurant concept! I thoroughly enjoyed their presentation of the food. I ordered the Tom Yum Goong rice noodle soup, and they laid out all of the ingredients on a platter in front of me. Then, they brought out my soup broth in a dangerously steaming hot pot and helped me pour everything in it to cook.   WARNING: the menu shows a thumbs up for the Tom Yum Goong and NO chili peppers, which is completely misleading. It IS spicy, I repeat, for those who are weak like me, it IS spicy. It's also a bit too sour for my likings.  So anyway, I ended up trading soup broths with my friend who had ordered the Origination soup, and I found that one to be a bit too bland. I mean, the restaurant claims to be MSG-free so the health-conscious me can somewhat let it slide, but I definitely felt like I was just dumping my food into hot water.   TIP: Don't forget to check in for your free dish of mini chilled noodles with any main order. Pretty great deal, thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place only got 3 stars on Yelp when it deserves 10!!! This is my absolute favourite YunNan style rice noodle in Toronto! It's authentic (verified by my friend from YunNan), packed with favours and the noodles are always perfectly cooked. I come here 2 times a week on average for lunch & dinner. It's also very decently priced for the amount of food you get. My favourites by far are the original YunNan rice noodle (with soup), and the Tofu rice noodle (no soup). They recently added some dessert options which are also amazing (try the Mango one). I also suggest staying away from the Tom yum noodle - personally I felt that the soup was way too strong but not in the right way. Other than that I love this place and will continue to visit every week! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sometimes, when you're in Chinatown, sanitation is second to food quality and service would be third in that order.  Origination encompasses this entirely.    When my friend and I walked in for another stop on our Chinese noodle crawl, we were not greeted with professionalism.  Instead, the servers were chatting it up and did not seem to take their tasks seriously. There were tables that were used previously but were not yet cleared and when they wiped a table for us to use, the smell of chilli oil from the previous diners' meals still lingered. Furthermore, when we needed to ask for service, the servers nonchalantly shouted across the room at us rather than coming up to our table to speak to us one on one. By no means is this a standard in family-run Chinese restaurants because my dad comes from a background in running Chinese restaurants and I have never seen such inefficiency in greeting customers to clearing dirty tables to providing ad hoc service.   Food-wise, their fare is average. They have Yunnan style noodles as well as pre-made beef noodle soups.  The ubiquitous ''free noodle refill'' gimmick is a value add here as well, but they don't have many varieties of noodles on the menu.  The broths were not flavourful and were very oily, making it hard to enjoy the entire bowl. The quality of their food was as unappetizing as their level of service and sanitation.    I will not be coming back and advise you to choose another noodle restaurant, like fudao, that is just a few minutes' walk from this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Honestly the biggest assault on the palate. It was scarily salty. Added water to my beef broth and was still inedible. What was disappointing, even more so, was their lack of customer service. My boyfriend and I went into a small quaint restaurant expecting a nice edible lunch to what turned out to be an overdose of sodium and lack of any distinguishable flavours. the noodles itself was passable and nothing spectacular; the lack of protein was well noted, even when I paid extra for added pork hocks, among other additions. We enjoyed their over-priced Taiwanese sausage dish.   The side cart of condiments was a nice touch but was not a redeeming factor. this restaurant was definitely a regretful choice as I spent over $18 on my portion alone and the meal was anything but cheap or worthy of its price tag. I would've rather spend that money on MacDonald's in this case.   I would not even entertain the thoughts of returning, no way-no how."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant when visiting Toronto and loved it. Really kind staff who walked us (the only non Asian people there) through the menu, including a really intricate tea ceremony. We are vegetarians and while there was only one vegetarian noodle dish, it was delicious and we got some vegetarian appetizers to supplement. All the food was great, and really different from the Chinese food we are used to because it's from south China. The place is also really cute, with great decor and fun music. Would definitely recommend as a great unique spot in Chinatown."}
{"text":"It's really great! Tastes so good! Even more delicious than the ones I had in China. Helped me kill my homesick hah! Lol"}
{"text":"We came on a Groupon, our expectation was low due to the medicore review on Yelp. However we were pleasantly surprised. The food was good! I ordered the Tom Yum rice noodle and my husband ordered the beef ramen. Both were delicious. I was also impressed by the condiment cart which they wheeled to our table so we can put whatever toppings we want on our noodles. I would definitely come back again to try the other noodles on the menu.   To the people that gave low ratings on Yelp and complained about service... It's Chinatown, what do you expect? If you want impeccable service, go to a fancy restaurant with the fancy price tag to match. I'm perfectly happy to pour my own water. Overall, I think the prices here are very reasonable. Even better if you came here on a groupon."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese noodle place in downtown Toronto. Huge portions, great price, delicious broths and combinations. My fav dish is the traditional Yunnan 'crossing the bridge' rice noodle soup which comes with a plate of meats and veg that they put into the boiling soup for you at the table. You then can load it up to your taste with the pickles, chilis and various other garnishes and sauces that they wheel over to your table.  Perfect meal for a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Luke warm service. Uncomfortable IKEA chairs and furnishings. Reminds me of eating at a friend's apartment back in my college days. Terrible dessert. Won't be back."}
{"text":"After trying a few other yunnan style noodle, we decided to give place another try and since then, we are hooked!  First, do not forget to check in to get your free mini cold noodle because that dish is delicious, especially for the summer! The waitresses tend to forget and charge you for it so do remind them!  Their cross bridge noodles are amazing, with a very clear broth with no additives (you can taste the difference!) and a generous variety of toppings. Portions are very generous and could feed two not very hungry people. We also enjoy their DIY noodles (which are cheaper) where they let you choose two toppings and a soup base and add in the rice rice noodle (Just be careful to understand what soup base taste like what or else you might have a very disappointing experience like i did in my previous review...) Portions here again are HUGE.   Overall, this place has become our our go to for some soupy rice noodles."}
{"text":"Authentic Yunnan noodle in town. Can't find another rice noodle place better than Origination in GTA. Must try their rose pedals syrup dessert. The rose syrup is  homemade from real rose. it's healthy and really good for your skin."}
{"text":"Condiment cart is so key. I'm a big fan of adding the Sichuan Pepper Oil to the broth, especially if you're a lover of spicy food. It makes a huge difference with the signature soup noodle dish I ordered.   HUGE.  To finish your meal on a sweet note, I'd opt for the White Fungus dessert. Skip Bubble Lu - it is simply coconut milk with clumps of sago and sweet croutons (?) atop of the mixture. I was lured in by the name's novelty... but it's nothing special.  Service is friendly and attentive. Big plus for serving warm water in these wintry months."}
{"text":"When I saw pictures from this place on instagram, I was super excited to try this place.  The dish I got,  pork hock noodles, was photogenic indeed...but not memorable. My bf and I were intrigued by this place before the visit since it is different from other restaurants around this area. Turns out...it did not measure up to our expectation.  SLOW SERVICE although the place didn't have many customers. OK food... wish they were more generous about protein. Way too much noodles compared to meat.  and Yes, the cart with condiments.... the waitress did not even mention about it. We weren't sure if we were supposed to go grab the cart on our own... again bad service.   Overall, overpriced food, bad service, cute atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Chinatown, Origination is by far the most memorable I had during my three days visiting Toronto. The waitresses can all speak English; don't worry about communication issues! The menu is pretty diverse but they have a cute map that recommends dishes for you. When you order noodles, they bring out a huge tray of pork, fish, chicken, and various vegetables. Then when your noodle broth arrives in a hot pot, they pour all the ingredients into the pot in front of you. There's also a cart of different spices that you can add yourself. Great taste for the value and I wish I could go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed nice and friendly and the ambience was alright. However, the food was really disappointing in comparison. Their signature dish origination Yunnan rice noodle supposedly should have a really tasty and aromatic broth. And my expectation was amped up even more when the waiter encouraged me to drink more of the broth when this dish was served. The broth, altogether with the rice noodle dish turned out to be over salty and lacked complexity.   The real bummer was the beef shank slice appitizer: a total waste of $6.50. A handful of really small and thin slices, some five spice powder and two types of sauce was all there was to this dish. The beef was totally bland if you don't dip them in the sauce and tasted medicore even with sauce. And for the price, you really expect at least twice the amount of beef, especially when the restaurant serving it is surrounded by cheap yet good value eats in Chinatown.   Stay far far away. I would choose $19.99 AYCE hotpot next door over this any day."}
{"text":"My husband and I started coming here early on when they first opened. We LOVE that they advertise MSG-free, and that they have unique dishes that are a fun authentic Chinese food alternative to Dim Sum, and equally delish, but completely different!!  Today I tried the Wonton Soup for the first time and it was spectacular. Light, but so flavourful -- my mom and aunt loved it too! The eat-in price for this was $4.50, but the order out price appears to be $5.90.  Usually I get the Tofu Rice Noodle(vegetarian), eat-in price: $7.90. My husband sometimes gets the Origination Yunnan Rice Noodle which he says is 'fun because they bring all the ingredients separately and add them to the hot broth!' Regardless of what you add the staff bring a cart with extra condiments and you get to add more of the flavours you like best. The tea KungFu Tea is great - really relaxing and flavourful -- $9.99/2people $15.99/4people  We've noticed that the staff often have a meal together if there is a lull in customers, they seem relaxed :)  Also: if you pay cash you get 10% off!!"}
{"text":"Some good yunnan noodles here for cheap.   Located centrally in Chinatown, this place provides great Asian comfort food. I usually get the customized noodles (you can pick everything you want in your bowl up to the broth) but a lot of people opt for the cutie pot. Regardless, I don't think you can go wrong here. They also steer additional toppings such as scallions, garlic and hot sauce once your noodles are ready."}
{"text":"Cutepot beef was excellent, really tasty..  Waitress couldn't have been nicer. Save 10% if you pay cash (sorry govt!). Want to go back.. Temperature wise, hottest soup ever! Long wait to eat it :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food, the people, the place, and kung fu tea, woah!  The food was healthy, not greasy, and doesn't have MSG, perfect.  Also, vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the restaurant because the servers were so nice and the concept is great, but the food didn't blow me away - it was just alright.  The noodles are served in a stone pot to keep it piping hot for longer, and it also comes with a lot of condiments on the side so that you can add flavours to the noodles to your liking. I think the condiment options are fun to play around with, but if you're not familiar with Asian spices, you might not be able to identify the different condiments. Because there are a lot of choices, it can get confusing as to what you should put in the noodles if you don't have the palette to identify what exactly is missing on your taste buds.  The portions looked big, but I wasn't too full after my meal. I think the portions look bigger in pictures and the noodles tend to float on top which make it seem like the entire bowl is filled with noodles, but there actually wasn't that much. I probably could've had a second bowl with no problem. Although, I wasn't overly hungry that day so it wasn't much of an issue.  I guess my primary concern was the price. For a meal for 2, we paid about $40 for 2 bowls of noodles and an appetizer, which is fairly high considering neither of us were full. I also wasn't in love with the noodles enough to justify the price - it was just ok, a bit bland perhaps because I didn't use the right condiments. The decor was nice and the service was good, but we were the only two customers in the restaurant so that could be why. I wouldn't be opposed to coming here if someone else wanted to try - I just probably wouldn't recommend the place myself."}
{"text":"Almost every entree here involves red meat. I ordered the shrimp and I got exactly three, although they're good-sized. The noodles are quite unique and the interior is really nice, air-conditioned, and served with a smile. There were as many non-Chinese as there were Chinese, when I was there, so I worried about it being like a fusion restaurant, which I dislike and am glad Orgination isn't. The portion issue seems to be a common complaint, and I hope they fix it. The noodles are delicious, again, but I don't want that to be my main course, despite the relatively cheap menu."}
{"text":"After passing in front of this restaurant sooooo many times, I finally tried it.  The noodle soups are really delicious. I should have stop here a long time ago.  The service is very good and fast. The place is nicely decorated and clean.  I will definitely come back and highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a good noodle place for downtown Toronto. We like the location and we came here on New Years day and we were happy to see that it was open. We had the pork hock noodles and the spicy beef noodle soup. The pork hocks were definitely better but both would have been improved with hand pulled noodles. It's understandable though, hand pulled noodles are a luxury and this place is good for what it is.  They have a special for $3.99 noodles and tea between 2 and 5 pm - sweet."}
{"text":"the origination rice noodles tasted light, and decently authentic from yunnan, although the noodles were thicker than typical. was kinda cool to see the entire tray of toppings brought out before the noodles, which the server added to a clay pot of boiling soup, one by one, and naming each thing as he went.  the service is pretty good. attentive servers, who were also funny and polite.  bonus - got a free cold noodle dish for checking in on yelp. a great way to finish the meal, as the noodles were flavourful and light, to cool down after downing a bowl of spicy hot soup."}
{"text":"I can't believe how stupid and irresponsible people can be.  My daughter went on Sunday evening September 3 and ordered a vegetarian noodle dish. She said she was allergic to peanuts. They brought the order with peanuts. She returned it. They scraped off the peanuts and gave her back the same dish.  She ate it and a few minutes after leaving the restaurant she started having an allergic reaction. We had to take her to emergency at Micheal Garron hospital where she received an intravenous treatment and was kept under observation. Thank goodness she is fine and recovered fully.  This idiotic behaviour to save one dollar of noodles is inexcusable. How stupid not to know (or care) how serious peanut and other allergies can be.  I reported this to the Toronto Public Health Services."}
{"text":"Umm 3 stars? I seriously doubt I people who do Yelp reviews know about Chinese cuisines!  This is a authentic Yunnan style noodle house. What's specially about yunnan noodle is they are made of rice. So similar to Vietnamese pho, but the broth and ingredients are very different. Super flavorful and the price is very reasonable.  My favorite dish is the shredded chicken and traditional noodle soup. But try as many dishes as you can, you won't be sorry,"}
{"text":"Tried beef stew. Bleh! There was no beef in it. They claim they used ox tail instead. Anyways, it was a bowl of broth with noodles (that tasted just so-so), and no meat, just pieces of cartilage or some connective tissues. I had to go buy something else after lunch at this place cause I was still hungry. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Ordered solely on other reviews. Pictures looked great and it is basically the only place that delivers Ramen. Should've known... We were pretty disappointed. Broth was salty and noodles were worse then that served from a package. Only reason they get 1 star is because it was delivered by Door Dash - Awesome delivery service!"}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times because I love the Spicy Ori. Rice Noodle and Yunnan Style Fried Rice Noodles. The beef ramen isn't bad either. They have great flavour without using MSG. They also have a trolley with additional condiments you can use.  Some improvements they can use are 1) more comfortable chairs, 2) more amount of vegetable and meat with the noodles and 3) firmer noodles."}
{"text":"This fast, affordable and yummy Yunnan style noodle house is a nice rep for the regional Chinese food scene downtown. Walked in on a Friday dinner with a party of 6 and we did not have to wait! There wasn't too much seating so the staff put together a few tables for us. Interiors felt like a cozy home kitchen and had student artwork on the walls. Rice noodles in soup are their specialty and I had the Cutepot Rice Noodles with Original Sauce (~$9). It came in a savoury broth with a mildly sour and spicy kick and was packed with minced pork and pickles. I loved the condiment cart that came as well where we could add extra toppings, chilis, and sauces.   For the savvy, they had make-your-own noodle combos which had a choice of soup base, noodle type, and toppings - this was useful tip they gave to a vegetarian friend. They recommended customizing the Tom Yum Goong soup base rather than ordering the Tofu noodles and she liked it a lot! Servers were attentive and always topping up water. Paying with cash is 10% off so my meal was neatly $10 including tip - a really good price for the taste and portion."}
{"text":"There was alot of heart and effort put into the interior and great selection of music played as background and ambience music. The concept is interesting like a hotpot concept with the food served. However, the proportions of the food seems too large with the noodles and insufficient toppings. There was alot of base soup. I ordered the Tom Yum with rice noodles and the tom yum has a bland taste ...although I would return to try out a clear base fish broth soup just for comparison. The staff was friendly. What I liked at the end was a small portion of melon cubes fruits was served. Serves as a refresher to your taste palate."}
{"text":"Two things about this restaurant really set itself apart from other restaurants in China Town. First, the staff were super friendly. Unlike the other Chinese restaurants in the area, when I asked the staff how each food on the menu taste like, they actually explained to me accurately, and patiently (sorry for being an annoying jack ass, by the way). Second, the restaurant is clean and organized. Most of the restaurants in China Town are greasy and kinda messy, but not Origination. Origination is cozy, pleasant and comfortable. I feel safe and happy to dine in this restaurant.  Food: they accurately presented how Chinese (Yunnan) people eat rice noodles. Upon the arrival of your hot broth, the staff will help you by putting all the ingredient into the broth. It's pretty cool. However, there was one thing that didn't satisfy me: the amount of ingredient was totally not enough. As probably you can see from my picture, I only got 2 slices of chicken, pork and unnoticeable amount of ham in my order. Unfortunately, because of the lack of diversity in ingredients, the noodle became pretty boring and monotone at the end. I think Origination should do something about that."}
{"text":"The interior decor is really artistic and the cutlery are very cute. Menu is different from most restaurant and u can tell that alot of thoughts were put into the design. The owner and staff are really nice and knows what to recommend for those firstcomers. I had tried most of their menu items and i enjoyed them all. The only thing i would recommend on changing is the portion size for the appetizers. Its a great lunch choice for those working nearby and if u just want a place to kick back n relax with some nice tea. :)"}
{"text":"I thought I've tried all the noodle restaurants in Chinatown, but I missed out on this one! My friend recommended the tofu rice noodle and at first I was skeptical because I was afraid of a small portion size and the lack of meat would leave me hungry, but I was wrong. The portion size was quite substantial and while there was a bit of minced meat, the not-so-hot special sauce on the soft tofu more than made up for it. The different ingredients were laid out beautifully on a bed of round rice noodle (not sure if the noodles were made in-house). My friend ordered the rice noodle with pork knuckle. She said that she usually orders a regular noodle bowl and the pork knuckle on the side, but ordering it as one dish was cheaper. While both our orders were not the soupy noodle, there was still some sauce in the noodle dish and once you mix all the ingredients together, the result was perfect! If you still want to customize your noodles a bit more, there is a cart that comes with an array of minced garlic, green onions, peanuts, hot chilis, various sauces, etc. I will be back for sure and will try their soupy noodle.  Tip: If you pay with cash, you get 10% off. And if you check in with your Yelp app, you can get a small order of cold noodles for free - double yum!"}
{"text":"I will come back again! We have tried the original flavour, it was so good! No MSG plus the soup was bey nice"}
{"text":"Origination gave me a feeling of home although I'm not from Yunnan. Been there twice so far, I really enjoyed their decoration, their service, and even their music. I had the pork hock rice noodle and one of the spicy cross bridge rice noodle. They're both very delicious. I really like Taste of Yunnan, but I think Origination has the better cross bridge noodles. The cross bridge noodles do seem a little pricey, but they have some cheaper options as well. I believe I'll go back and try one of their cold noodles soon!"}
