{"text":"Dommage, je ne retournerais plus là bas. Lorsqu'il est venu le temps du méchoui, j'ai du m'absenter à la toilette accompagné de mes nièces et il y avait une file devant la toilette (seulement 1 toilette/sexe et le resto est plein). Lorsque je suis arrivée à la table, les serveurs ramassaient les assiettes de méchoui et je leur ai demander de m'apporter un morceau de poulet et un morceau de filet mignon. J'ai demander à 3 serveurs et ils m'ont tous dit oui avec un rire moqueur et il ne me l'ont jamais apporter. Lorsque venu le temps du café, j'ai demander très gentillement à la serveuse si elle m'avait oublié, elle m'a confirmé que non et que me lapporterait en roulant ses yeux. Beef - ils ne m'ont JAMAIS rien rapporter et ont éviter mon regard. Quelle absurdité, surtout lorsqu'il restant bcp de méchoui. Je ne leur ai même pas demander d'en faire du nouveau, simplement qu'ils m'apporte un morceau ou 2. Du bon taboulé et hummous pour un prix qui est supposer inclure un repas complet est un réel manque de respect. Plus jamais je n'y retournerais et ne recommande pas ce resto."}
{"text":"The platter is set up beautifully. The tiger shrimps are huge and taste amazing, too. The filet mignon was very flavourful and each bite was delicious with the rice. The chicken was very tender and good as well. The only thing that I wish was more juicy would be the quail. Great value for the dish, easily shared between two people."}

{"text":"Lebanese food is something I'm not very well versed in. You see folks, in a land far far away where I grew up in Central Canada it's not very common. So I've only experienced it the last 11 years of my life. Also, it's not a cuisine I seek out on a more than frequent basis. Most of what's readily available are what one in Quebec would call casse croute (junk food) Lebanese Schwarma places. They still are delicious, however it is junk food no matter how you slice and dice it. 

On a casual meetup with a friend he suggested La Cave du roi. We always try to go to new places. I'm thinking....I like the name!  The cave of the king in literal English translation. I was thinking before I arrived, what kind of King would possibly live in a cave? A king would typically live in a lavish palace? Would you digress? 

When I'm at an establishment with a huge menu offering I find it hard to decide what to order? So my friend mentioned Lebanese is great as you can order a bunch of small plates. Fantastic. With a few questions and suggestions from the server we were on our way. The table came with a bag of pita bread. We ordered fattoush salad, hummus, baba ghanoush, soujouk, kafta, filet mignon and to finish it off was an atayef with Lebanese coffee. It truly was a meal fit for a King! 

Exceptional standout from the meal was the fattoush salad. The kafta and fillet mignon were cooked perfectly also. The soujouk was okay. I'd probalaby not be in a rush to order again and all the small plates were a great compliment. I've never had atayef before but it was a nice finishing point with a strong espresso style coffee. Overall a very nice meal. We went a little crazy and thus it was $32 after tax and 15% tip. There are reasonable options that should run you around $15 for lunch but we went a bit gangbusters. 

Only downside to the meal was we entered the restaurant early and were the only ones seated. Then a group of about 10 people entered and in an otherwise empty restaurant they sat them right up against us. You know the feeling when a loud boisterous group competes for volume and is seated next to you? Yup... That's what happened to us. A minor annoyance to an otherwise excellent meal."}
{"text":"'La Cave Du Roi' provides Lebanese-styled food with a specialty geared toward entrees for both the hot and cold varieties. They do however offer an extensive menu of others options in Arabic cuisine.

We came here for lunch and we opted for a meze styled lunch that pretty much destroyed all hopes and aspirations to be productive at work later on in the afternoon. We shared plates of  hummus, baba ghanoush, fattoush salad, soujouk and a meat plate of kefta and filet mignon. 

We washed it all down with some Lebanese coffee and a atayef dessert. 

So... let's break it down!

Hummus : Chickpeas blended with tahini sauce with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. What's not to like from this popular dish? Their version was very good with the right amount of everything to make this a strong start to our lunch marathon.

Baba Ghanoush: This dish is basically cooked eggplant mixed with onions, tomatoes, olive oil and various seasoning. Their version was alright but I'll freely admit that I'm not a huge fan of this plate in general.

Fattoush Salad : The ultimate salad for me. Basically it is a bread salad made from toasted or fried pieces of pita bread combined with mixed greens and other vegetables, such as radishes and tomatoes. Add some olive oil and a lime-vinaigrette and you're in for a good time. Their version is probably one of the best fattoush salads I have ever eaten! So good!!! I'd go back for more of this! We took a small plate and I regretted it immediately after I had my first bite... definitely wanted the large portion. :) THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!!!!

Soujouk : Soujouk is usually a dry, spicy sausage usually found everywhere in eastern europe and the middle east. The variety you can find can be wildly different from place to place. Sadly, their version of this is \"wet\" and almost soup-like. Disappointing and I won't find myself having this one again.

Fefta/Filet Mignon meat plate : Kefta is minced meat seasoned with salt, paprika, cumin, parsley and so forth. It's also not unusual to have cinnamon, paprika, onion and mint as well. Everyone has a a slightly different take to this yummy recipe. Their version was very good, slightly smaller than expected but quite good. The star of this dish to me at the very least is the filet mignon. It was marinated in something and completely out of this world good! I'd go back again just for this.... SO GOOD... PRACTICALLY orgasmic.

Lebanese coffee : We opted for dessert and took some Lebanese coffee served in a small coffee pan where you can personally pour your coffee in tiny beautiful cups. The portion we got allowed us to each have 2 refills which is great!

Atayef : For those of you wondering what this is, let me break this down in fine detail. An Atayef is a thin Arabic pancakes. What sets these pancakes apart from what you're used to is that they are cooked only on one side, the other side is velvety because it is covered with bubbles, this allows the flavors of the filling to permeate the atayef. These pancakes are 'usually' stuffed with a cheese or nut filling. In their version it tasted quite similar to ricotta cheese. Then these pancakes are sealed and baked or fried. Then they are dipped in ground pistachios and served with a drizzle of syrup or honey. 

Long story short, it was amazing and I wanted more! :)

As for the resto....

The place is clean with nice seating, nothing good or bad stood out .

The service was friendly and helpful. The food came quickly, table was maintained well and things went smoothly. The dining experience took an hour which is OK for lunch.

My only gripe was an odd seating arrangement with other patrons. When we came in we opted for a pair of seats near the front window. The restaurant was empty. A large group came in and were sat right beside us. They were loud and obnoxious until the food came. This bothered us greatly (thus why I'm docking rating) as there was easily 40 other tables but for some reason they were sat beside us... and the odds are were to make sure the window looked full of patrons for other patrons wanting to come in. 

Not a fan of sacrificing our dining experience for some marketability for more patrons.

As prices go, you don't need to go eat at Damas that will cost you $200+ for 2 people. We ate very well and for $50 for 2 people there's was some serious value to be found here. We can come back and opt out of a few items and eat well for $20 a person. Very reasonable.

I will find myself coming back here in the future, it's not the best Lebanese I've has in Montreal but it fulfills the need at a great price vs value. Excellent lunch option as well.

Conclusion, 3.5 stars rated down."}
