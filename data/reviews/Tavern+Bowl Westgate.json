{"text":"I came in the other night hearing about the place from a friend. He said the food was good but they had a bit of a problem with their service.

When I got there there I did have to wait a bit before I was seated, around 5-6 min. There weren't a lot of people so it was a bit annoying. After that things went smoothly.

I didn't bowl as I just wanted to try out the drinks and bear and let me tell you, the food is amazing. I ordered the fish and chips as well as the tavern burger. The food took about 15 min to come out but when it did... MY GOD, WAS THAT BURGER GOOD. If you go def. get the tavern burger as is. By the time I finished it I was too full to eat the fish so I got it to go. It was good but man, that burger.

I would say the service is 7 out of 10.
The mood is a 9 out of 10.
The drinks were fine 8 out of 10.
Food (mainly just that burger) 10 out of 10.

I think I have found my new fav. burger."}
{"text":"Sad, went there today and was rudely turned away by the people standing and decorating the front door. We asked if we could enter and they said \"no\". Then another staff member chimed in, after seeing our frustration, \"no there is a private party\". No signs, northing posted and nothing on their website. Drove all the way there to get lousy customer service and rudeness. Super sad too, we were there last week and had a good time. Need more consistent professional customer service."}
{"text":"Great specialty drinks, our bartender Shannon made the best margaritas ever!  The macaroni and cheese balls are awesome!  Great service, nice place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was way super expensive and he service was slow. If your gonna go just to eat and drink, I would not go. Food was ok, not amazing but good."}
{"text":"Went on a slow Wednesday night. My family and I had to wait until the hostess and another employee finished their conversation about their mothers before being acknowledged.  We sat on the patio to watch the game and waited 10 minutes with no service. So we went to another establishment."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in after passing by and seeing how cool it looked on the inside. It was pretty full but we were able to get in right away. We let the host know that we wanted to watch a fight that was on, but were seated at a table that was inconveniently located for good viewing. When we asked if it was possible to get a different table, we were told that the the restaurant charges \"around $50 or $60\" to change tables. We hadn't ordered anything at this point. We decided it wasn't worth paying for a different table and ordered food and drinks. The beer was fine, but the food was not. The chicken wings had no flavor besides salt and pepper, and the chicken \"strips\" were really four flattened chicken patties. The fries were the only saving grace. Overall, the experience was underwhelming. The food and service needs some work. Could be because the place is new, but we don't plan on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I have to say I will be going back! The food was hot, delicious, and packed with flavor. They also give great portions so you can take the rest home. They have deals and specials on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  They also have a great range of alcoholic beverages and beers. There is definitely something for everyone. You are also able to sign up for rewards and receive coupons, promos, etc."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place to get a margarita, bartender said \"I'll make a good one because we're out of salt\" and it was basically drinking sugar water. Cool place, gross drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and here's the skinny.  This place is a lot of fun, especially with a group.  There are a couple of things that are a bit of a draw back.  

First, it's a bit pricey.   The lane price is not so bad with a group of six, which is the max they allow per lane, but the drinks and food are a bit overpriced.  This isn't the end of the world. 

The thing that really caused me to drop the rating to three is our most recent experience.  We had a group of six and we didn't even get to bowl one full game.  We were in the tenth frame and the game just shut off.  The waitress let us know when we had 7 minutes left and asked if we wanted to purchase another ($45) hour, but really...?...you can't just let people complete at least one game?  We dropped over two hundred bucks for an hour and didn't get to complete one game.

It's a fun place, and I'm sure I'll go again, but from a customer perspective, there's room for improvement.  

Please consider altering your time policy to at least allow your patrons to complete one game."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar tables and after a couple minutes the manager Pete came over and introduced himself. Jenny our waitress was very friendly and took care of us.  Brittany was very friendly as well.  I have to say they all made it a point to demonstrate that they wanted us to come back and have fun. Definitely check this mutha fucka out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been there a few times for the food and drink. Very good so we took family and friends today. Disappointed with service and food. Waitress had an excuse why we couldn't get ice for ice tea. Tall beer glasses not available because no clean ones. The place was not crowded how could you not have enough clean glasses! Asked for limes they never came just got up and got them myself. Outside tables needed to be cleaned. Bathroom locks not working. Food not hot. I'm hoping it was an off day. Will try again. This place has only been open months and its already going down hill. Please get it together."}
{"text":"Food was great, good place to watch a game... but the service is really slow and not very attentive. We waited for about 20 minutes (after we were given the bill) to close out while 6 people stood (our server included) at the hostess desk and ignored the tables. Nice people and good food, just bad service."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered some nachos. I told them I had an AVOCADO ALLERGY and they said they would accommodate for it... then the food runner brings me a pile of nachos and the main topping is avocado/guacamole... I left shortly after... horrid service I will never again come here due to their late timing and obvious lack of attention to details especially allergens"}
{"text":"This place is great all around. Diana who was our server is a great asset to your establishment.  She was very friendly, my drink was never empty and her food suggestion was on point.. The grilled wings were awesome... This is a fun and entertaining place!!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I'm here visiting from LA with my 3-yr-old, and he loved it! It's kid-friendly, just as friendly as our server, Daniel. He was awesome!! He was on top of it all, and great w/suggestions. I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I took my youth group here for a great night of bowling. We loved the themed bowling options. We chose the \"you-tunes\" bowling theme on our touchscreen stations. It snapped some pictures of us to show on the big screen as we bowled. The teens loved it. We ordered food too, the most memorable item was the Parmesan garlic fries! I think I'll go back for those alone! Great place to bring family and friends!"}
{"text":"Brought my family including kids for summer vacay...we had an awesome time...great service, food, & environment! Our waitress was Sierra-the bomb!! We will definitely be back! Keep up the good work, great idea to have a bowling alley at Westgate!!"}
{"text":"Next visit to this place was horrible.  Food was greasy, and cold.  Manager was firing a server in front of the patrons.  Who does that but some idiot for a boss.  Will tell all my friends to stay away from this place.  It doesn't deserve one star, but it does deserve a -10."}
{"text":"Daniel was beyond the BEST person I've ever met. I'd highly recommend him to serve you guys. He definitely over exceeded at his job. I couldn't be any happier!! Definitely coming back soon  Thank you Daniel if you're reading this! 
-little petite gal ?"}
{"text":"Love it! A perfect place to hang with the family; a few drinks for the adults and some bomb bar food like Mac n cheese balls to snack on while we play. The price is decent, we did the hour for 3 of us and got almost 3 games in! If we weren't snacking between turns we probably could've gotten a full 3 games in. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite bowling alley! They have so many good food options but, I recommended the donuts in a bag. They're so delish! Gonna be making frequent visits in the future. Just thinking about the place makes me hungry. I came on a saturday and the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Such a great place. Food were amazing and cocktails  were even better. The bar tender was energetic and fun."}
{"text":"New place so we decided to give it a try.  We like near Westgate, so something new is always nice!  This is a trendy place -- food, bowling, craft beers.  Seems they only have maybe 8-10 lanes so I assume a reservation would be great.  We decided to come for food only today...

We walked in and there were 2 hostesses standing at the front talking.  No one even acknowledged us for a good 7 minutes.  Then the manager came up and they decided to sit us.  Not a great start...which sadly continued.  We were sat for almost 20 minutes before 4 servers and a manager came to ask if someone helped us.  We said someone took our drink orders but never came back.  He said ok and walked away.  Lol...5 minutes later we got drinks.  Then we found out our \"server\" (never said his name) was training Jake.  Jake was fabulous!!!  He is training as a server but will be a bartender.  If it wasn't for him we probably would have just left.  If u come ask for Jake H (there are 2)!!!! Ok onto the food....

It's Wednesday, so majority of appetizers, beers and bowling are 1/2 off.  Not a bad deal right!  We decided just to try some apps with the specials.  We went with bacon Mac and cheese balls, loaded tater tots, and chicken fingers with fries (yes this is a app!).  The loaded toys were good.  My hubby loved them!  To me they were a little soggy, but he wanted them so we got them.  The bacon Mac and cheese balls were room temperature which irritated me at first, but I then realized that I wouldn't burn my mouth.  My husband liked that they were not scoring hot.  They were good but had no bacon flavor, which was disappointing.  The sauce they come with was also spicy and good flavors.  Lastly was the chicken tender and fries.  Ok....TRY THIS!!! This was amazing!!!  First it's fresh chicken with great flavor and crust!!!  So yummy in the tummy!!!   The French fries were also crisp and hot!  We opted for the salt and pepper fries, I would order this again!   It was so good!!!  

Overall the food carried this place.  At first I was ready to leave and then our views turned around.  I think I would for sure give this place another try.  I will update with a hopefully better overall experience."}
{"text":"Initially showed up around 3:45 on Sunday 5/28.. saw it was $3 per person per hour before 4pm to bowl per game.  Me and my 2 buddies thought the prices were awesome.. 15 mins later after standing AT THE COUNTER a manager or someone walks by.. asks if we've been helped.. we say no.. he says \"someone will be with you shortly\" and proceeds to the couple behind us, asks them the same thing then says \"come to the bar and let me get you a drink while you wait\".. umm we were there 20 mins before them and wasn't offered a single thing. AMD THATS JUST THE START!!! 

Then there's 4 workers standing in a circle laughing and cracking jokes not even helping!! We finally get help from the front counter and he tells us we're only allowed the hourly rate because it's after 4... I mentioned we were there before 4 but whatever.. he sits us at our lane and tells us a server will be with us shortly.. our server finally shows up in the 8th frame of our first game..  we don't see him again till 7th of our 2nd game and by then the keg is tapped so we have to wait even longer for our beer. 


We get the check, and notice they charged us $7.50 per beer when the menu says 5.50. The waiter never asked us if we wanted a pint or a \"tall\" even though the \"tall\" was barely above a pint. Only reason this gets 2 stars is because of the atmosphere and the potential of this place seems to be good but for now it sucks.. I'll update my review if I go back and get better service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Chef Paul recognized us from the last time we were there and delivered a spectacular salmon and grilled romaine Caesar salad that I had been craving! Our server Chelsea was great and kept our drinks full ($1 home brewed beers on Thursdays) and was super sweet! The atmosphere was great and we were super happy overall! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Good, Bad, Ugly beers are good and $1 on Thursday. Who has dollar beers, much less good ones?  Came in tonight before a concert. I love their grilled cheese but it wasn't on their event menu. I asked and they made it anyway since they weren't slammed yet. Nice! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First experience was a Saturday afternoon of day drinking & we rolled up to the indoor bar & happily found $3 cans of Kilt Lifter & a few other craft beers which was a good deal at Westgate. The selection of drafts are really great too.So we stayed for a couple. This was our first stop so eating something was a necessity & decided to try the chicken pesto sandwich. The sides offered were seasoned fries, sweet potato fries, tots, sweet potato tots & a house salad. We opted to share & get the house salad. The sammie was definitely big enough to share. The chicken was juicy, bacon crispy, the arugula brought the peppery freshness, the  roll was warm & soft. I really didn't get enough pesto in my opinion but I like a messy sammie. The salad was a homer too. It was layered with flavor & fresh veggies. I really liked the pickled onion on top. Just brought it home for me. I'm looking forward to checking this place out again at night for a date night & get some cocktails & some fun games."}
{"text":"Went there last week and was treated especially rude by an employee by the name of Crystal.  The food was cold, beer was warm, and the staff was rude. When I brought it up to a manager i was told not to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped at Tavern+Bowl for a weekday happy hour and we were happy that we did!  The drinks (Margarita's, Michelada's, house beer's) were all very good.   Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful.  

On the menu, the pork sliders were good, but nothing to get excited about, however; their Bacon Jam Sliders were amazing!  I would definitely order them again when I return.  

We didn't play any of the games, but it's nice that you have the option for bowling, pool or shuffleboard."}
{"text":"The wings here are delicous!! I got em spicy and they were nice and crispy and WET  the way wings should be. Fried pickles and ranch also great!"}
{"text":"Tavern bowl looks like s fun place to hang out.  I took my gf there for the first part of her birthday gift and it was a fun time... the catch?  $$$

We paid for an hour of bowling before 3pm on a Friday which was $20 + $4 each for shoes.  We both played on a single lane with no-one else and got in 3 games with a little time extension from the hostess (Sierra our server, was awesome).

Bowling is timed and minutes are provided in the top left corner of the screen and time starts 5 minutes after the front door clerk takes you to your lane.

Drinks (alcohol) we ask a bit pricey at $8 each and didn't taste like much alcohol was in the drink.  

Pizza was slightly better than typical bowling food... but not by such a margin that would make me want to eat dinner here.

The other thing about the bowling experience is that it may not be for the serious bowler.  The lighting cast a glare on the lane to such an extent that one couldn't see the arrows on the lane.

Overall 2 drinks, 1 pizza and an hour of bowling + tax and tip was close to $60 and that was before the pricing increased $10 to bowl after 3pm.

Fun, once, but won't be a regular spot unless really good deals or discounts are found."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews but this place is probably the worst place. They make u pay after you bowl so it ends up taking an extra 20 to 30 min to get your check. Then they give you 3 checks to sign ( one for shoe, bowling, and what u order). Most importantly, they charge me an extra $10 in tip money after I only ordered 2 beers. Don't pay with your credit card! They will write in extra money in your tip when you u leave and hope you don't notice. Damn $10 + $2 = $12 in tip I gave him to bring me 2 beers. Better to go to a regular bowling alley!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and I heard if it's recent opening. It's in Westgate which is a very enjoyable and attractive area. Tavern and Bowl blends well with the setting and perfectly balances an atmosphere for your college friends or your family. The staff were kind and bowling rates were finely priced. Here I had their amazing Bacon Jam Burger which was a bit pricier than the average restaurant burger, but very substantial in size coming along with fries. The food was great, the area is awesome, and it is a great place to decide for a night out."}
{"text":"I had high expectations but when our party of 4 walked in, we decided to sit outside because the music was so loud and obnoxious!  If this was a rave I could see it but a drink after the game was impossible! We had one drink and left.  We also counted 14 people who left without being seated (who came to the same conclusion)!  They were younger then us!  I will never come back.  Can't see this place making it.  It could be such a cool place...sad."}
{"text":"Ran into this new spot after Cardinals game and I loved it!  They have bowling, games, sports bar, brewery, great food and beer. The best part of the excellent service! Will was on top of it and really gave us the weekly specials and w a smile.... great service! The manager Peter was awesome as well! Thank you so much for the service and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Bowling was great! Pizza was good and beer was good! I wish the place would be busier- ILove a good busy atmosphere for bowling! Definitely will be visiting again soon"}
{"text":"The staff was great, very friendly and helpful.  Someone was always around to help us.  We bowled and hung out at the bar, never did we receive bad service. Bar tender is cute, fun, and efficient. Love my girl Rae!"}
{"text":"Had our corporate event hosted at Tavern+Bowl and it was great!  Both managers on shift went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly.  Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating 2 birthdays last night.  The food was good, service was ok.  We bowled too.  Bowling was fun Happy Birthdays scrolled across the screens which was cool but the server did not acknowledge the birthdays or give us the birthday desserts.  She also took about 20 minutes to split our bills.  So all and all good food ok service from the server.  People up at the front were super nice!"}
{"text":"Our whole group had a great time at our party in Tavern and Bowl. The service was great. Our server was as nice as can be but a little scattered. The manager that night was wonderful and very attentive. Food was great I recommend the brownie!!! Drinks were great but a little pricey. I would plan a party there again. Thank you Tavern and Bowl!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the set up and atmosphere! My friends and I went for a couple beers, food, and bowling it was great. The employees were all so nice and the service was amazing. Food tasted great. They have really nice daily deals too! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos with bean salad was awesome. Clean and fun new spot in Westgate. Check it out!"}
{"text":"They took care of us!! Great service and super attentive!! Will definitely be back! Ask for Joseph...he is the bomb.com!! \"He's a villain, ready to make a killin', like he's ill'in\"!! For real, come check them out! Fun. Period."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday for our first visit did not disappoint! The chicken tacos are an early fave, but each of their flavors are delicious. The service is great. It's still new and people are learning, but everyone was very attentive and super friendly. Try the tequila poppers to take the edge off of an ugly days and to open your appetite. And then eat some more!"}
{"text":"Bowling, food, beer, and FUN! Gotta love Tavern Bowl... it's something we definitely needed here at Westgate. The Strike pizza is a MUST HAVE! Very very yummy! The music was great, and so was the atmosphere. Will for-sure come back. You can bowl 6 people per lane, and the couches and seats are very comfortable. #lthx #tavernbowl"}
{"text":"OK, finally a bowling alley at Westgate. I think that was the only thing lacking but now its complete. To top it off this bowling alley is actually really cool. Its a tavern and alley so if u want a restaurant, bar, bowling alley, chill spot to play pool...hello!! 

The decor is very outspoken. I am actually not sure what its suppose to be saying but its a bit of skulls mixed in with large in your face quotes. 

Something interesting is they offer different types of bowling games. So the normal bowl and strike is not your only option. We played one and it was actually very interesting and fun. 

They offer you to pay for an hour for $19 or per game ($3 per game per person). We learned with 6 people it took us about an hour to play one game so if u have less than 6 ppl might be cheaper to do it by the game. Another thing we learned when your hour is over the game just shuts off. Also, careful when you buy an hour because it starts 5 min after you arrive at your lane (who knows how they determine when you arrive) but if you dont have your shoes on, if you haven't picked your ball or set up the players then you better do it quick.

The food I will say is a lot better than normal bowling alley, bar food. 

Service was par. Our server actually forgot a few things and we had to find our own silverware but she was very nice and personable so thats a plus."}
{"text":"Wow... What an awesome place.. Each time I go there I have a blast.. One of my favorite places.. Food, drinks, atmosphere is just awesome.. Oh and our Server Daniel was the best.. 
I'm only asking for him now on.. Can't wait to go back.. Thanks Daniel and TavernBowl your guys are the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We went in for the first time on a Saturday night....Jade greeted us with a smile, and was super attentive. Even though here weren't any lanes available, she made us feel welcome. We went over to the bar, and met Ray, who was not only an amazing bartender but very personable and was quick to point out the bar's specials. We will definitely be back! (By the way, we ended up bowling and having a great tome!)"}
{"text":"Was here on 5/4/17 prior to going to the movies. I actually tried the Yard House but they were packed. I read about this establishment in December and that they would open mid-March. I was intrigued as I love craft beer, bowling and live close by. 

The initial appearance was good, plenty of space and a clean design. Despite ample staff they seemed unprepared for the rush of customers that would soon befall them. They lacked communication and the food runners didn't know the table numbers and had to be redirected by servers or bartenders. My sever bore the title of \"trainer\" but when asked simple questions like \"do you have a wheat beer or a porter or stout?\" He admitted that he wasn't 21 yet and didn't know what any of that meant. Later I found out that the brewery portion of the establishment was not operational and only canned and bottle beers were available. Disappointment is an understatement. 

The manager Pete stopped by to ask how things were going and was receptive to feedback. He offered to take an appetizer off our bill for providing feedback which was much appreciated. 

I used the restroom which was inconvenient to get to because of the layout and could definitely see problems on busy nights as the only hallway that has access to the bathrooms intersects with the door leading to the kitchen and the line; collisions are bound to occur. The bathrooms were set up nicely but with only two hand dryers and no towels, it doesn't encourage hand washing by patrons.  

The food was typical fare and was completely adequate. Despite the promise of flavorful combinations, the mac and cheese bites and pork BBQ sliders were quite standard and uninspiring. I understand this is not a fine dining establishment and more of an Applebee's with rental shoes, but some flavor was expected. 

I'm not writing this place off yet as Pete explained this was just a soft opening and the official opening is scheduled for the end of the month with an appearance by the mayor and media. 

That said, I found it disconcerting that a place that touts having a brewery opened its doors without one. 

P.S. I received my bill with the appetizer that Pete said he would comp, still on it. I paid in full and informed the server that if he reminded Pete that he promised to take it off the bill, he would have another $4.50 (on top of my 15% tip) for himself."}
{"text":"Decent food, but if you are going to depend on local patronage, you should use Arizona based companies to outfit your business. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to head over here with a couple of friends and we were not disappointed! We ordered a Strike flatbread and some wings and they were both delicious and modestly priced. The lanes had enough space so that we didn't feel cramped with the party next to us. It was a great night out!"}
{"text":"First off AMAZING FOOD! We ordered way too much and it was all delicious we definitely over ate! Second, this is definitely the coolest bowling alley I have ever been too, I loved the sports bar meets bowling alley meets night club vibes and can't wait to go back for more fun!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for a date night and had a blast! It's a cool, hip version of your typical bowling alley. More modern. Huge selection of food and drinks. We got the ballpark pretzel which was gigantic! Came out hot and the cheese sauce was delicious. Also got the Hawaiian flatbread which was alright in my opinion, wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order it again. Think it was just me because the hubby liked it. Overall fun place and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Tavern+bowl for the first time on a Saturday night, greeted by a very nice hostess, had great service, food, and drinks. There was no wait for a table and 40 min wait for a bowling lane which worked out perfect for us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was kind of lousy. Our waitress was on her phone while we were waiting for our check for about ten minutes. At one point there was no one at the bar or in the dining hall. We were told our meal comes with loaded tots, garlic fries, fries, or sweet potato fries so my boyfriend and I got the garlic fries and loaded tots, just to see on our bill it was charged extra. Kind of sleezy for her to say it comes with our meal only to find out it's extra. Food was ok. Really pricey for how it tastes."}
{"text":"This place has lots of great specials, but not during special events. Boo. We thought it was happy hour and ordered some stuff just to find out that it was a limited menu and no happy hour. But they have specials every day of the week. It was Tuesday, so we got to order some yummy tacos. And the kids enjoyed the flatbread/pizza. We bowled for two hours and had a blast!"}
{"text":"First off our server didn't know what a Newcastle was to say they didn't have it.  Secondly our lane wouldn't pick up the pins then clear the downed ones.  They reset it.  Then it didn't record my strike and gave it to my husband.  They we're going to reset it again when I requested a new lane.  The fried pickles are in spears so that's a plus.  I ordered a Meatza pizza, which I thought was a small size pizza, it was actually a flatbread, and a disappointing one at that.  I'm pretty sure our server just has a hearing problem at this point because I have had to repeat myself several times.  Other than that it was ok."}
{"text":"Can you guys not put a giant pillar in the middle of the bowling alley where people are supposed to bowl, it makes it impossible to do curve shots which is the only way I bowl. Thanks."}
{"text":"Stunningly clean bowling shoes which could count towards 5stars alone! Adorable selection of videos that run after your turn, perfect to entertain any age. You can link your game to Facebook or even insert your selfies to the videos (instead of just an old school playback of pins falling you'll see vids of your face imposed in sheep and a fox, sumo wrestlers, etc). The hours FLEW by! Yummy pizza flatbread, too."}
{"text":"Had a patron on the rocks and crown on the rocks with an order of 12 wings. We were charged for 2 patrons. 1 at $11 and patron on rocks as $14. (Of course he took off the $11) Since when is ICE $3?!?! Seriously. There are better ways to earn a buck than charging for ice. The wings were decent but your charging for ice is stupid.

Meanwhile over at Bar Louie about 2 seconds away from here:"}
{"text":"Brand new to this area and found a great tavern with a bowling alley inside...took the family out this afternoon and the kids enjoyed it so much it's really fun for adults and kids it's worth going especially the westgate area there's so much to do #tavernbowlwestgate FUN FUN FUN FOR ALL"}
{"text":"Had a nice appetizer and beer sample tonight. Crazy huge pretzel and solid margarita/beer. Michelle was our server and we had probably the best service in years. Def come back, maybe try bowling next time!"}
{"text":"We had a company party at Tavern+Bowl last week. The experience was good. The consensus is that everyone like the environment, loved the food (we had a Mexican spread). Everything but the nachos were a hit. The staff was very attentive as well. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our first experience at Tavern + Bowl was a good one. The kids get to bowl free for an hour during a summer promo they're currently running, and their half-off happy hour prices make for a cheap date here. The overall look of the place is modern and well maintained. We ordered two different flavor of wings (Tavern Kick-ass sauce & Beerbeque), both pretty tasty and bigger than your average wing. The kids seemed to enjoy the chicken strips, and had a blast overall. Also a fun way to escape the brutal mid-summer heat for awhile."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends and I am never disappointed. Tavern has a huge location with lots of TVs to watch games or fights. It's a great spot for birthdays. Burger is awesome. Huge beer selection. Staff could be a bit more organized when taking food orders & bringing them out. Other than that, I've had a few amazing experiences here and never leave unhappy."}
{"text":"This place has become our favorite in Westgate. It has a pretty large draft selection, big TVs for watching games, and phenomenal food. We love to come here and eat/hang out seeing as it is usually the least crowded restaurant at Westgate, which is a huge plus if you hate being packed in at places like BW3's or YardHouse. Not only is it less crowded, but the food is better priced and WAY higher quality than both of those places. We have never even bowled  we just love it here.  The nachos are out of this world. We always get the carnitas."}
{"text":"Scene: Located in the Westgate district of Glendale, Tavern+Bowl is just a short walk from either the hockey arena or the football stadium. Tavern has a central hostess stand to the front of the primary entrance and behind it bowling lanes. To the left of the stand is seating for folks to eat and drink. It looks very corporate and trendy but caters to all sorts of crowds.
When I was there, they had a live DJ playing some music. There wasn't much of a dance floor, but a group of girls made do dancing between some tables. 

Service: The service was okay. I walked in to an already seated table, and it took several minutes for our server to come take my order. She was friendly, but nothing about the service was fast. I ordered a Guinness (Which she wasn't sure if they had it (They did), and a hamburger. The burger took about fifteen minutes to receive, the Guinness, five. 
The real lack of communication is that we had to wait to ask for our tabs, and when we did it took about ten minutes to get them, and an additional five to get our cards back with the check. 

Food: The food was okay. My burger had a significant amount of char to it. Not enough to make it bad, but enough to make it taste like it had been cooked over a live flame for just a hint too long. The fries were fries, tasty but still the standard fried potato fare.

So Would I recommend The Tavern+Bowl? Yes, for groups of folks meeting to go somewhere else. If your not in a hurry this place is not bad. If service is important to you, it might be worth going to one of the more upscale places within the complex."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! When you first walk in it looks like a more adult place to have a fun night out and maybe it is on a weekend or after a Cards game. But we came in on a slow Tuesday afternoon with our two small kiddos and the ladies at the front made us feel super welcome. We got a lane and they set us to have a blast. Our server was always smiling and quick to check on us. Even after some small tantrums and spilt milk from our three year old. As far as the beer and food go we only had some appetizers and a beer but they did not disappoint either. We come to Phoenix every year for Spring Training and we will make sure next year this place is on our list of stops. Thanks to the lovely ladies who made our little chaotic family feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"You must go!  This place is fun and the food is amazing!!!  I have been here two times in the last two weeks and have not been disappointed at all.  This place has great customer service and the food is phenomenal!  I spoke with the chef and was told that the kitchen is a scratch kitchen, it shows in the taste and quality!  We ordered the french dip both times and we've ordered the spinach dip and nachos.  Did I mention that the food is really good?  We have told several people that they must go because the atmosphere is lively and because of the FOOOOD!  The rest of my group is looking forward to the craft brews to be served!  One day we hope to try bowling.  Also, they show UFC and hockey on the big screens :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have a great happy hour and it's even better on thirsty Thursday...they have $1 GBU 16 oz draft beers from 5 til close and 1/2 off appetizers during happy hour...everything was excellent even the service that was so busy"}
{"text":"Jade at the front desk is the best. She made the whole experience amazing and totally worthwhile . Food was awesome too."}
{"text":"Tavern+Bowl is a new addition to Westgate! Really glad they opened up a unique bowling spot so close to home. More modern than the oldschool bowling joints and connected to a newly built brewery! 

Some friends and I decided to go bowling last night and we had a blast! The bowling alley was definitely nice! It was clean and modern and made you feel like you were at an upscale bowling alley. Reminded me of Lucky Strike! There were many gaming options to choose from. There were mini series, the classic bowling option and others. We rented a lane for two hours and tried most of their bowling game options. They were all so fun! Some of the games even incorporated you into the game by choice of selfies! 

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I went back this weekend to give it another chance and I have to say the food was phenominal. 

We had the loaded nachos, the wings, chicken strips and fries. My wife and I had a few beers and they were awesome as well.

Our service was great, the atmosphere was great and we definitely will be coming back for sure!

{"text":"One of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had but could use some raspberry jam on side or a slice of green apple on it. The fish and chips could have used one more piece of fish, almost looked like fish sticks but it was really good. The grilled wings were very good especially  the beerbque sauce. The 3 cocktails we ordered were delicious...Moscow mule, stormy colada, and sex on a bull. The water in the bathroom was too hot and needs to be turned down for sure. Overall great new place in Westgate."}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends! Food is good a little pricy just under $60 for two to eat. Long wait times for the lanes. Manager came over and told us of all the stuff coming up like their brewery. Definitely worth coming to have a night of fun."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Our strike pizza was delicious, and it was so nice not being on top of the other groups, nice and private and cozy. First time bowling for our daughter and she cannot stop gushing about what a great time she had, thank you thank you thank you!"}
{"text":"Had such a great Friday night. Staff was friendly and fast. Drinks were great beer flight highly recommended. Bowling was fun and little to no wait. Above average customer service, great happy hour on food and drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Saw a movie at AMC and came over here after to have a little fun. Asked for the pool tables and was told to pay with the server. 20 minutes later and after many employees walking by ignoring us we decided to leave. When we returned the balls to the front desk they told us we couldn't leave until we paid. After explaining to them we didn't pay because no one bothered to serve us  (when there were just about as many employees as there were customers) they told us to sit tight and then someone brought us a bill a few minutes later. I was ready to spend the rest of the night here not to mention at least $100 but they just lost my business for good in the matter of 20 minutes."}
{"text":"We had so much fun bowling this weekend.  We had our family and friends for a round of bowling, shared a pitcher of beer and devoured the fried pickles.  We like that the food and drinks are an upgrade from the usual bowling ally culinary selection, and the kids loved taking their photo for their player icons. 
Just make sure you're prepared to pay for parking if there's a Cardinals Game that day!"}
{"text":"Went there and it wasn't what I expected. Bowling prices are very expensive, food was awful and service was downright non existence. I gave my food back to server and told him it was awful and he did nothing. No visit by manager either so we just left. I won't be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends and have a great time! The food was excellent and the beer selection was great. We went on a Wednesday night and had half priced appetizers and drinks. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in for bowling on a Sunday afternoon. It was great! They have shoes for kids and lots of different bowling ball weights. Snacks were terrific. We tried a flight of the house beers, a GIANT pretzel with cheese dip, a flatbread pizza, mac'n cheese balls, wings and donut holes. Service is pleasant and prompt. Everything was clean and in great condition. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wish I knew about this cool new place sooner!!! We had a great time bowling, drinking and eating! Daniel and Michelle were great servers! The interior design, menu and prices are spot on...U must try this new place!"}
{"text":"Came to westgate to watch a game- wandered into this place because it wasn't too packed!!! Was presently surprised by the food and drink! The lemon pepper wings were amazing! Perfect crunch on the outside, and  good size for wings. I got the southwest salad- it was great- my only complaint was that the cheese on it tasted strange. My husband got the bacon burger. He really enjoyed it! Our waitress D was really sweet and kept checking on us often. We also got the bottomless mimosas- but we ended up only drinking one, so she took it off our bill! Super awesome service- D's attention to detail- really made me want to come back!"}
{"text":"Overall had a great time at the bar. It's unfortunate that the bartenders feel like we owe them something for being there. The first time I got my beer the male bartender just slammed it on the bar and half of my beer spilled on the coaster. Come to think of it it wasn't even a coaster it was just a napkin. The beer is good and the atmosphere is good however the lack of customer service or attention to detail really makes me question whether I want to go back there or not. I would like to feel welcome at a bar,not a burden."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could!! Absolutely amazing place to go. The free kids bowling Monday-Friday is a great way to beat the heat in the summer. We had the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers (omg, soo good!) and a pizza which they put on a pizza round (normally a flatbread) since we had 4 kids with us. They all loved the pizza!! My kids are always begging to go back!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place impressed me and they aren't even fully open! I walked in was greeted immediately by staff they were so bubbly and outgoing and already made a big impression on me! My boyfriend and I just went to check it out and now we have a new hang out spot just for drinks and fun! The manager jason was so nice and he really made sure we were taken care of! For a manager just opening a business and running around making sure his customers are taken care of first huge props to you jason!! But what really impressed me was the server we had Daniel! This kid was so outgoing and so polite! Give that kid a raise! He always made sure we were taken care of had drinks or needed anything else! Everything is brand new and I can't wait to come back and bring my friends and family! Thank you Daniel and Jason and Staff you guys are doing an amazing job for just opening! Ignore the negative you guys will crush it with the customer service we received tonight! Thank you!!

{"text":"I am not a huge bowling fan. I am not good at it. But I went to a birthday celebration at this place and I love the set up. Music wasnt too loud. Food was real good. Drinks were good. The space and seating you have in front of your alley is comfortable. I might actually go bowling again soon. Oh and the tv walls....definitely a great place to watch boxing, UFC, or the games"}
{"text":"While peaking in the window Saturday afternoon one of the staff came out and told us we could bowl for free as they were having their soft opening. We decided to have a beer and something to eat but we never got to bowl since the Kane's weren't ready. The staff was great and I fell in love with Kilt Lifter Scottish ale! Yummy! I just wish I could find it in central California."}
{"text":"The place is perfect! The staff is amazing and so is managers. The place is clean and the drinks are always amazing! Great for dates or families! Plus walking distance to other festivities in westgate. The music also is popping today! DJ on point!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent venue to go bowling. The DJ was playing great tunes, the food was delicious and we received excellent service from everyone! The Margherita flatbread was to die for! There was not one thing I would've changed. Amazing experience had by all!"}
{"text":"First time here! Great atmosphere, had a really great time! Didn't realize the Fiesta Bowl was taking place in the stadium next door so paying for parking was weak sauce, and they don't validate parking. If they did, I woulda given this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great environment and had a lot of fun bowling , but very pricey. The food is way too expensive for what you get. We got the nachos ($12.00) to share. We payed the extra $3.00 to add chicken. I definitely would not recommend them. The chicken tasted like it came from a can. Yuck! The giant soft pretzel was really good, but the cheese to dip it in was nothing special. The beer flight was really good and tasty!"}
{"text":"This place just opened and it's a glorified bowling alley, with less lanes. Take a restaurant (ok food) and add, a DJ, pool tables, a booze locker, tons of televisions and 10 lanes, BAMM! This is a glorified bowling alley with a wait and more booze. I can see what the owner is going for and wish them well, I just don't see it lasting. I still feel like I'm in a weird bowling alley with the same quality food and lanes that are simply in two different locations. There is the feel of a sports bar and yet the sound of pins and a DJ are throwing that off as well. There are some things that you shouldn't combine, it's a Frankenstein effect."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 different times. Tonight we took our daughter, who is a Marine home on leave, we have been bragging about the food to her. Because, there was a hockey tonight, their menu was non existent!! It is ridiculous that prices jump that much because there is an event. As a local that lives in the area, we will now make it a point to nor come here during events. Where we usually spend over $100 per visit, this time it was a flat $25. Our server brought the appetizer we ordered and when we asked for our check, it took over 15 minutes to get that. Because they were all prepping for the hockey game. Now we will really be sure to not support our local area on nights there is an event at the Arena."}
{"text":"Came in because we heard kids bowl free from 11-4 in June, July, and August, Monday through Friday. Plus happy hour is from 3-7p so that was enough of a win to bring us in! Interesting atmosphere, I haven't been Bowling in years but this place is definitely not your typical bowling alley. We were greeted right away, grabbed shoes, and brought to our lane. It wasn't busy at all, and the service was pretty quick.
Our server (not sure what his name was) was friendly and attentive... 
I was looking forward to the happy hour menu, but was told no happy hour due to the Soccer Game (ugh!) 
Multiple types of beers, and specialty drinks. The Netflix and Chill was tasty/sweet but barely had any alcohol. ..was more like soda.
We ordered the Mac/Cheese balls, & Pulled Pork Sliders, which were pretty good! Along with a Burger/Tacos. The food was awesome, again nothing like your typical Bowling Alley food! 
There is a small kids menu, but everything a kid would love (chicken, pizza, etc) 

The only thing I would actually complain about is the game pricing, and the fact that we had to pay $10/(30 minutes) to finish the game (so we had to pay for half an hour but finished in less than 5 minutes) 

Overall a fun place with great food, just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Tavern has  a really cool vibe as soon as you walk in. We arrived a little early so we were able to go to the bar and get some drinks. 5$ flight of their own beers was really cool! Our lane had awesome lighting, lots of throwback music, and the best part was getting to add our own pictures to our bowling names. The food was surprisingly good with quite a few options. I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"had a great time there with wife and kid. but wow was it pricey.  we bowled , had food and had some drinks and the bill was over 100 dollars. we will go back but no way doing all three again."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of having tasted Chef Paul's food at the West Valley Moms Blog Bloom event last month where they served the Wilted Cesar Salad! I must say I was taken a back when I was informed they catered the event. And that the salad was not a regular on the menu. So yesterday we went in and I had to ask for it! I was surprised that Chef Paul came out to meet me! Beside the salad all their food was on point! My husband also ordered fried pickles (spear shaped and not greasy) chicken tenders and chicken wings. If you are looking for a place to take the family to have fun, but not \"bar food\" this is the place!!"}
{"text":"I brought my nephew (age 4) here because I heard they have a free bowling program. For bowling with a child, I would not go back. With paying for my bowling and food, it cost much more than had I gone to a regular bowling alley. Also, I just bowl for fun, but if I were serious about it I would not have been happy. A couple times the computer did not track my score and one of the guards that was up for my nephew stayed up while I was bowling too."}
{"text":"We live near by and have been to the tavern several times. The service has always been on the slower side with few people in the bar but non the less the beer and food is always good. Tonight we invited some friends with us and the tavern was very busy compared to when we are normally there. Service was slow but it seemed under staffed all around. We do appreciate the manger picking up our tab with the meal that was behind in kitchen and a round of beers but non the less they need to work on more help all around.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Fun bowling spot with great service. The food menu is your standard sports bar type food (pizza, wings, burgers). We ordered the flatbread pizza, wings, and spinach dip. All were very yummy. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that we had to call the bowling attendant at least 4 times because of glitches we were experiencing (needed our pins reset, screen reset a few times, time expired too early). Other than that we had a great time bowling."}
{"text":"We came here before my first NFL game, and it was delicious - GO HAWKS.

Four of us came here to grab some dinner before the football game, and we made the right decision. The guys grabbed chicken strips and fries, and myself and another friend had the Southwest salad. We also shared a pitcher of the Hefeweizen. Good decisions were made.

Service: It was great! They were slammed with the snowbird/Seattle crowd, but the waitstaff did a really good job. I get it, the Seattle crowd can be a bit rowdy, and I suppose some would say... high maintenance. The waiters were super helpful and considerate given all those extra variables. The only issue that we had was that the service was a little slow. Given how packed they were though, I have no real complaints.

Food: Tasty!! The chicken strips weren't your regular deep fried crunchy chunks of chicken. Instead, they appeared to be panko-breaded pounded chicken breasts. By far, one of the best chicken fingers I've had! The fries were also good, but I feel like we got the random ends of the fries instead of whole pieces.

My salad was so so good. It was slightly spicy and very flavourful. The chicken was tasty, and the only thing that threw me off was the grilled avocado. I prefer the fresh uncooked variety.

Ambiance: This place was absolutely full of energy and fun. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, the first thing that caught my attention was the lighting in the bowling area. It was night vision with green lights - I think it looked awesome! They have a few bowling options meaning you can bowl a traditional game, pick themed games, or even do quick mini games. I forget all the choices. My friends and I tried a mini games where you try to knock out your opponent's castle. For every pin you knock out, a portion of your opponent's castle is destroyed by aiming a canal ball. I just love how you have different ways to bowl to change things up a bit. We had ordered a flatbread and soda, and our serve was super attentive! He checked on us throughout our time to make sure we were all good. I really appreciate that kind of service."}
{"text":"Nice spot at westgate to hang out but last couple of visits service was lacking.   I ended leaving the last time I was there because the server never samento check on us for a food order."}
{"text":"First everything about this place is amazing!Staff Is so warm and inviting,although they've been going through a soft opening the place looks fantastic.Oh my goodness and the food? The food is amazing I had a southwest chicken salad and holy freshness! I couldn't decided what the best part of the salad was! Was it the grilled avocado or the perfectly spiced black bean and corn salsa? It was just great. Give these guys a chance I mean bowling and beer on top of great fresh food,what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Had my son's second birthday last weekend. This place is really new, and it's great for small parties (20pax approx ), whereby both adults and kids would be able to enjoy. We love how it is Not crowded (on a weekend afternoon) and we were the only few who is celebrating my boy's birthday. the pricing for the bowling is quite reasonable, @ $29 per lane per hour for 6 pax max. But Shoe rental of $4 per pair is not inclusive. 
And I like that they had a variety of food selections. Our personal fav are the beerbeque wings! 
Everything is great and the only downside is that food takes abit longer to served."}
{"text":"My whole party was turned off that they had the napkins and silverware with the bowling shoes. So much so we decided not to stay. They were spaying the shoes right next to them. Gross. First thing you see when you walk in."}
{"text":"Simple and sweet. 
Overpriced to bowl, expect bills to be mixed up and confusion if you have a big party, and a manager that doesn't know how to lead his staff or train them correctly. I probably won't find myself here again."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place! It's something we don't have on this side of town and the food way surpasses that of what you would find at a regular old bowling alley or most restaurants in the area. The server said it was a scratch kitchen and you can tell! The mac and cheese balls are the best thing on the menu and they're huge! We also tried some flat bread pizzas and the cheese is super gooey and piping hot! Great and friendly service, we had people refilling our drinks and checking on us all the time. It'll definitely be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"We were exited to see this place going in at Westgate, as we live close, and have the occasional date night there. We went for the first time for a birthday party, and it was so so. 

First, it is expensive, especially if you're gonna bowl as well as eat. They were busy due to being a Saturday night, but the service was very slow. 

The food was typical bar style food, and wasn't bad, but nothing special. For what you pay, I was expecting better. 

The bowling is much cooler than your typical bowling alley, so if that's what you are going for, then you won't be disappointed. The atmosphere is fun, and usually good music playing.

UPDATE: after leaving this review I was contacted by the manager of this location and offered for my wife and I to come back and he would make it right. I just wanted to say that was great of him and I truly appreciate the offer. Thank you!"}
