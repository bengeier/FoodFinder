{"text":"This place used to be one of our favorites. We both got sick after getting the fish during Lent last year. Decided to give them another chance and was disappointed.  Menu was smaller than I remembered,  service was slow, and the food (chicken) was dry and bland. Four waitresses standing around bickering.  5:30 on a Saturday and only two other tables were occupied. There is a reason for that."}
{"text":"Awful service. 

We don't come here often but have always had decent experiences. Good food, not quite the value of Armstrong's but a closer drive. Upon hearing they were under new ownership, we decided to take the family for dinner. 

We walked in and were \"greeted\" coldly by a server. Not a great start but we gave it a pass not knowing what she may have going on. We were seated and asked for our drink order. Drinks came fast but that was it. Once our orders we taken it was all down hill.

The kids' food came quickly as was decent. Once we received it, my son decided that he wanted a ginger ale. I told him to wait until the waitress came back and we would order one. She never did. 

Once we started serving the kids, we realized that we didn't have napkins or silverware. We tried to catch the attention of another waitress but could not. The kids could eat their pizza and quesadilla with their hands but we needed napkins. My wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels. 

It became comical after 15 or 20 minutes when my boys were done eating and our steak salad and steak hoagie did not come out. At that point, the table behind us caught another waitress walking by, \"We've been waiting for 15 minutes for our check.\" We weren't the only ones forgotten here. We couldn't even ask for our son's ginger ale or silverware for the table because nobody stopped by to check on us and our waitress was missing for over 20 minutes.

When our food finally came out, we had been there for almost an hour. The kids were done eating so I asked if she could wrap it up. \"I'll bring you some boxes.\" Seriously? I could almost understand that response if we were troublesome. We didn't have the opportunity. In the hour that we had been there, the only contact with the staff was being seated, ordering, and receiving drinks and half of our food. The few touches we did have were decidedly negative.

As I sat there packing up my own food while my family got their coats on, I decided to write this review. What an awful experience. 

The food was just OK. The quesadilla had bacon in it. Fine I guess but just call it a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and serve ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Otherwise, just make a decent quesadilla. The kids pizza was fine. The steak salad tasted fine at our kitchen table. The steak was the best part. The rest was mostly head lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumbers with shredded cheese on top. (Go to Armstrong's if you want to have it done right.) My steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches. They soaked the bread in butter making a fat pill even bigger. I wouldn't recommend it. Bellisario's across the street does it way better. The fries were fine.

They were busy but the general atmosphere, lack of service, general lack of caring makes this place the worst restaurant experience that we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Note the date on this review because, yes, this place used to be awesome. I keep giving it chances and now i am DONE. I just had the worst meal ever here. It is the NV salad. It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting. Ad the draft beer is luke warm. Not surprising it was empty when it used to be packed on friday night for dinner."}
{"text":"We live very close to this restaurant and go there often.  I appreciate how the new owner has tried to institute new specials and discounts however I think he is missing the point.  This restaurant does not need new gimmicks to make it better, it needs a new chef.  Sorry Chef Jeff.  This place needs a staff that knows how to cook, not a new menu with the same old crappy menu items.  Hire a new kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!!! 
When I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago, I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant. We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!"}
{"text":"About exactly what you'd expect for average local place.  Nothing terribly spectacular but not inedible. The food is on the bland side but again about what you'd expert. The server was nice and we did not wait long for appetizers or dinner. Keep your expectations realistic and you'll be fine here. Otherwise, seek dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Getaway in a few years, and now I remember why.  Aside from my hubby, who got a burger and fries, we were all rather underwhelmed with our dishes.  Once upon a time this place used to be really good.  Now not so much."}
{"text":"Went there with the family because it was a close option. Got there before the dinner rush. I ordered two different kinds of draft beer, they were both terrible. The taps are dirty and the beer is flat!  We heard a server and cook shouting at each other in the kitchen. The staff walked through the dining room having shouting conversations from a cross the room with each other, as if were not there. Our server had her cigarette pack hanging out of her apron. Classy!! Unfortunately the food did not make up for the lack of professionalism of the staff.  The menu had nothing exciting. The food quality was subpar! The new owner's have a lot of work to do!"}
{"text":"My daughter recently moved nearby.  Despite a bunch of negative reviews, we decided to check it out anyway.  4 of us went here for lunch.
My my my, what a pleasant surprise!  I was expecting (due to the negative reviews) a real s***hole, but upon entering, the decor is actually very pleasant.  It does not have that typical bar, rundown, needs updating appearance.  And from what I was able to observe, they try to keep it clean; even the Men's bathroom was clean.  The servers were not just wiping the tables clean, either.  They were spraying them with sanitizer and THEN wiping them.
On to the food.  As I said, it was lunchtime, and they had a pretty good crowd for lunch.  It took a while for our server to get to us, but once she did, the service was excellent.  Prompt drink service and didn't have to ASK for refills.  She kept our glasses full.  Everyone enjoyed their food (a burger, club sandwich, and 2 different salads).  Not only did the food TASTE good, the presentation was excellent as well.  Nobody in our party ordered dessert; we were all too full.  They DO have a dessert case with some scrumptious looking selections, though.
We all agreed we would return to The Getaway Cafe.
As I said before, all of the negative reviews of this place made me a bit skeptical.
I am glad we checked it out anyways.
Based on the fact that my daughter lives in this neighborhood now, we WILL return.  And when I do, I will update this review.  If the food/service/decor changes, so will the rating.  Based on 1 visit, though, I was impressed.
Oh, one more thing.  I saw several complaints in previous reviews about this place being overpriced.  I'd say they are about average.  The days of the $5 hamburger are about gone.  This is 2013.  While they may be a buck or two higher than some places, our bill for lunch for a party of 4 (drinks included, tax included) was $44.  Considering that a value meal at McDonald's is about $6 now, that's not too bad."}
{"text":"I was greatly disappointed by this restaurant. I had a  coupon for a meal there and finally went. The place was very busy and noisy. People who were,obviously regulars shouted to each other. The woman sitting in the booth behind mine startled me by shouting to someone right over my head.

I ordered a steak, Delmonico, (rib-eye) my favorite. I ordered it medium rare. I suppose it might have been medium rare when it came off the stove, but, since it had been placed on a steaming iron serving platter, it was more like medium-well when it was put before me. The meat was inferior, full of fat and gristle. When I was finished, half the plate was filled with the fat and gristle I had cut out. Further, there didn't seem to be any seasoning on the steak. It  was tough and boring. Yuk. 

I complained to the manager about the meat. He was very gracious about it, told me the meal was on him, and that I could come back and use the coupon at another time. I decided that I wouldn't do that, that forgetting the place was the best option. 

Unfortunately, my head is sometimes up my own behind. When I got home, I put the coupon back in my stack of coupons and forgot it. A couple of months later, I found it and decided to go because I didn't  realize I'd been there before. 

The place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit. I ordered barbecued wings and a pasta dish with shrimp. 

The wings were awful. They were large, tough and tasteless . The sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste. The pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, though, and I was thankful for that.

I must say that the service was excellent on both the occasions I visited: courteous, friendly and efficient. The managers on both my visits were very kind and accommodating. Nevertheless, I will not go there, again."}
{"text":"The Getaway Café is tucked back off of McNeeley Road in the South Hills.  It is a casual restaurant and bar that serves many types of food.    The food is delicious with something for everyone.  The desserts are varied and decadent.  They have events and music different nights of the week although we haven't been around for those yet.  They have lots of drink options (beer, wine and a full bar).

The first time we visited, we met the owner.  He gave us his card and wanted us to let him know if there was anything he could do for us.  Since then, we have been here a few times with family and friends; every time, we have had a nice experience."}
{"text":"We go to the Getaway at least once a month. It gets a little crowed and noisy but the pasta and wine and other entres are worth it...And the service is great..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative I would. It was horrible. FIve people there on a Saturday evening. Service sucked. Couldn't get a beer if we tried. Bartender gave last call and didnt realize the owner was there, and he yelled at her. Horrible, horrible all the way around. Steer clear if you want a beer!"}
{"text":"This place has always had a reputation of terrible service and average to below average food. I heard recently that it was under new management so I decided to give it another shot. Well it might be new management but everything else has stayed the same.

When you walk in you have to wait to be seated and you will wait. The staff will do their best to not make eye contact and treat you like you are bothering them.

When we finally got seated, I asked what beers they had on draft because there was no drink menu and the waitress had no idea. When she brought me a list, I placed my order only to wait 15 minutes before I was told they didn't have what I ordered. I asked again if she could tell me what they actually have and once again she stated that she didn't know.

The food was average at best, we would have been better off just going to Eat N Park. As we ate we watched and listened to other patrons complain about the food and service. Some customers were so aggravated about not getting their check they just waited at the front trying to get anyone's attention. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Dined here this past week.   We had to dine early due to a commitment so when we entered only one table was occupied.   The dining area did fill up.   My dining partner ordered the prime rib.   The meat was a little over cooked and about 1/3 was fat which couldn't be eaten.  (we know to expect fat on prime rib but this piece seemed to have more than usual). Ordered a baked potato which arrived with no butter.   My meal was crab cakes which were OK.   We've been to this place many times and sometimes the meal is good and other times it is just OK.   We were just glad they still had the carrot cake for desert!"}
{"text":"Your typical local neighborhood bar. We live right down the street and every time I drive by it always seems to be pretty crowded.  Last Saturday we ventured in and sat in the bar area.  They have plenty of dining room seating as well.  Getaway offers a nice list of draft and bottle beer. They were out of the Rivertown can I wanted so I went with my second choice of Angry Orchard cider.  The menu has many options including salads, burgers and sandwiches plus dinner entrees. For Saturday the special was all salads were $10. I went with the buffalo chicken salad with blue cheese dressing, it also came with tomatoes and onions. The buffalo chicken was fried and had a great sauce.  My fiancé ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich, a very big portion, which he got with fries. The service was very good and we had a nice evening."}
{"text":"We were pleased to see the dining area not busy at all. Ordering was fine, food came out in great time and hot. 

I Thought things were going ok but the server never bothered to check back for any refills on beer or water. When she finally came over she dryly asked if we were ready for our check. Um, I guess we are being encouraged to go? 

I can see not coming back around  if the dining room was packed and they were short staffed but we practically had the dining room to ourselves and our server just never bothered to come back."}
{"text":"Once one of my favorite places, Getaway Cafe kind of fell off of my radar around the time that I wrote my original review for them. I've only come to Getaway two times since then.

The first time I came back to Getaway after last reviewing it, I was actually treated to a very good meal, much like what I'd come to expect from Getaway in the past. A friend and I opted to copy each other and both ordered the Getaway Signature Wrap - a wrap stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, chicken, oranges and feta cheese, plus balsamic dressing. While the contents of the wrap were admittedly not evenly distributed, meaning some bites popped with more flavor than other, this was a VERY yummy meal option, and a nice break from the usual wrap options you find in restaurants. And the piping hot fries that came with it were perfect, as usual. While the food did not disappoint, however, we ended up waiting almost half an hour for someone to come and ask if we wanted dessert or a check after finishing our wraps. That wait time was with us trying to flag someone down. We weren't sure what happened but we weren't exactly pleased with the delay. The moist and thick chocolate cake at least helped to improve our moods a bit, but I left thinking to myself, \"yep - still just 3 stars.\"

Then last I came back to try Getaway yet again, this time after spotting a special burger option on Facebook. Once again, the food did not disappoint, as I received a juicy burger that dripped meaty grease and egg (as one of the special toppings was an egg) with every bite. As usual, I couldn't have stopped eating their addictive yummy fries if I wanted to. Aaaaaand unfortunately the service once more left a lot to be desired. This time I actually had to point to what I wanted on my menu, as my waitress didn't seem to understand what I was saying when I ordered. I wondered if she was new, even, since she didn't actually seem to know what was even on the menu. She also forgot to ask how I wanted my burger, and ran back out from the kitchen a few minutes after ordering. At least she checked. Fortunately this time around my dining buddy and I did not experience a 30 minute lag in service after eating, but we did think that things ran pretty slowly considering the place was mostly empty.

At this point I think my final score of Getaway is a solid 3.5. The food really is usually delicious and even if most of the menu is standard with the occasional twist here and there, it's at least full of perfectly cooked comfort foods. But during my last three visits service on the floor or the kitchen has always had a hiccup of some sort - it's officially become normal at Getaway Cafe for me, and so I can't really justify a full four stars. Sorry, Getaway. I'll definitely still visit you though, if it helps!"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve live entertainment was terribly depressing & a poor choice for New Year's Eve.  Talked to his buddies over the mic & was very annoying.  Food mediocre.  Disappointing overall.  We left early."}
{"text":"Very strange place. Idk what was going on but I went in around 12 pm and there are tons of young kids (5-8) running around the bar. Not a big deal just thought it odd. Got a huge plate of nachos were alright. The rest of us got assorted hoagies. Just meh sorta flavorless. And side dishes tasted as if they were made a long time ago. Good place 4 a large group to drink get apps tho."}
{"text":"Great Service.  Went to the getaway with my sister for lunch. Our server linda was great. Told us the specials and kept our drinks filled. Had the steak salad. Very good.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great for wings, especially take out orders. You get 10 crispy, meaty wings for 8 bucks and they are delicious. Take out takes about 15-20 minutes and the service has always been good. Nice bar as well and they Alain have a decent size dining room."}
{"text":"I debated posting the full story, but the service was very bad, and I'd like to justify my low rating.

Let me just say, the food here was good when I actually had it. So good, I wanted to place a pick up order that a friend would get and bring to a party I was having.

At noon on a Friday I called Getaway to place an order for wings. 

1) When I asked how many wings were in an order I was placed on hold so the hostess could get a manager to answer my question. (Ok)
2) After deciding to get a bucket I asked to pre-pay so that my friend would only need to pick up and go, I was put on hold again while the Manager got ANOTHER manager who knew how to run as credit card payment, (really?)
3) I hung up after providing all my card info and letting them know the order would be picked up at 4pm.  When my friend got there, no one had any idea about the order and said that didn't have it, and that the earlier manager hadn't left any note. I told my friend to forget about it. (You've got to bee kidding)
4) On the way out they stop her to say that the kitchen did indeed have the order made. GREAT! Except they still didn't know anything about a payment and she would have to pay for the order. (Oh, heck no!)

This was after already being there for 20 min and the wait staff were not remotely apologetic.  Not only had they failed to check with the kitchen in that time, but they expected double payment.  So they kept their wings and my card was still charged.  When I called on Monday to speak with a manager about the charge, I was told that none were there and they weren't sure when he'd arrive.  I called twice and had zero apology, help, or resolution."}
{"text":"This is Brookline's best kept secret. There. I said it. Jack H. and I took a last-minute \"Getaway\" for lunch after one sad Pitt loss. Our spirits were buoyed by their delicious gyros and friendly service. It was the weekend of a Blue Moon promotions and the glasses were etched with the Steel City. I inquired about buying a pair, and the manager kindly GAVE them to us instead. From start to finish, a positive experience. Next time, I'm going straight for their killer cake selection."}
{"text":"I feef that the waitress was not trained correctly and she should never have been fired"}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Getaway Cafe, and it never disappoints. I had the Mykonos salad, a favorite gyro salad loaded with feta, gyro meat, pita  and a tasty dressing.
The Mrs had a steak salad, daughter an Italian hoagie (also a favorite) and we shared a basket if home made chips. I have to admit it had been a while since we had dropped by, but I am looking forward to returning soon. As mentioned in other reviews fantastic desserts by Signature Desserts in Castle Shannon. Great food friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. 1 bartender/waitress per 40 customers... And the owner is sitting around drinking, watching a game. I came to watch a playoff hockey game and there is classical music blaring in the background. Had to go to the bar and order food, and was given attitude by the bartender/waitress. No thanks."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by the getaway. We are here often for dinner or some drinks. Their dinners and specials are the best part, for me. Could have a better drink selection, but still always something decent on tap.

From wings to hummus; chicken to fish, the meals are always well worth it and delicious."}
{"text":"not good, and I wanted it to be.

the decor has been the same for 20 years.  there were flies everywhere.

My friend had the scrod and it was flavorless and dry.  my salad was just ok.  they need a new chef and menu.

The menu was stained pieces of paper stapled together.  add subpar service w mediocre Food and there's no reason to go here"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Sorry, guys. It used to be awesome, the steak salad was my favorite. Huge and filling. The last two times we've gone the potato skins were so dried out I could only eat half of it and the steak made me sick all night. And the service is sad. I'll eat here if someone else is paying but it's not my choice place anymore."}
{"text":"This place is in need of some serious upgrades, from the food to the decor.  The look of the place from the outside is not very inviting.  It looks dated and boring.  This should especially be an issue for a business which is not on a main road and should be looking to attract new customers that drive by on McNeilly.  The inside is kind of depressing to be around.  You can definitely tell that the atmosphere has not been updated in a very long time.  This might keep older generations coming back, but it is just not an attractive place for new customers.

On top of the atmosphere, the food and menu are very boring.  I'm not going to say the food is terrible, but it is very basic food.  I have been eating here with my family since I was young and I have never had something that has stood out.

I will say, service is usually very friendly and nice, so they have that going for them.  If they would just bring the place up to date it could be much better however."}
{"text":"Cute place...
I went here after a kickball game with some of my team members.  The staff were fantastic.  I called to make a reservation and they were very nice.  They also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar.  

Upon arrival the bartender was very pleasant.  She showed me to the table which was marked reserved.  

She took drink orders then food orders.  My guests said the food was good but I didn't have anything.

There are TVs all around the bar and some games to play as well.

This is a little gem in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best-kept secrets in the South Hills.  Try the bruschetta as an appetizer.  They have an okay vegetarian selection and the drink menu is average.  The service is awesome, and the desserts are to die for!  I usually don't eat dessert, but the carrot cake... Oh boy!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Getaway for years and I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed yet! We used to frequent the Saturday AM brunch with family but since you can't always please the older crowd we've unfortunately strayed away for a bit. Since then I've been to the Getaway for random lunches but most notably my wonderful MIL threw my wedding shower and a surprise birthday party for my FIL there. Both events were fantastic! I can't say enough about how wonderful the food and staff was for both parties. My shower was almost two years ago so I'm not sure if fits in with the new ownership but the surprise party was just the other night. For the shower, guests could order off of a small menu and the party was buffet style. The food was wonderful and we had the perfect amount of servers attending to our needs with no sour attitudes. We got together with family yesterday and couldn't stop talking about how great the party was. I can't wait to head back soon to try out some of their new menu items. Thank you, Getaway Cafe!

Added bonus: their desserts are from Signature Desserts in Castle Shannon! Don't leave without getting your dessert on! You're welcome."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved up the street from The Getaway. We have been here multiple times for drinks and the late night menu. I the hometown bar atmosphere here after 9. The bartenders have all been super friendly and attentive. 

I've also attended several Meetups at The Getaway. These were with parties of 10 or more. The food was great as always and the service was still on par with a full dining room and a large party people. 

I enjoy pub events, and The Getaway has a full complement! I've attended \"Name That Tune,\" and it was another noteworthy evening!"}
{"text":"I was out for a girls night.  Decided to stop at the getaway.... We arrived there was no one here then about 10 o'clock a band wagon of middle school children arrived with there\"parents\" took over the juke box and dart boards.  We finally decided to leave at 11:30pm it was very inappropriate.  The parents were pre occupied by there social activities.  The mothers took part in these inappropriate behaviors with underage children at a bar/restaurant at 11:15 at night.     Would rather go to chucky cheese!!"}
{"text":"I like that they support live music but this place smells like feet other than that it's not too dreadful.  NOTE: Management changed sometime in July, 2017.  I don't know if this review is still valid. I'd very much like to hear from folks who have been there post management change."}
{"text":"I know I just wrote my review but I stopped here again on Tuesday (11/11) to meet my boyfriend,his sister, and her husband for dinner/drinks and the Pens game and I had 2 food items that I would order here regularly so i had to update......for my meal I had a turkey rachael (and yes I had it on rye not my usual italian or French) and this easily was one of the best I've had in awhile (not quite as good as my favorite from the Smallman Deli but still close). The chips were homemade and crisp-kettle cooked how I prefer them. For apps our table got cajun wings (I did not try these) and a Buffalo chicken pita pizza ( grilled chicken set atop pita bread with Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing) and the pita pizza was 4 pieces so it could easily be a full meal too-which is exactly what I think I'll do next visit. It wasn't overly hot and the ranch definitely helped tone that down. Service, as usual, was stellar so will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Seems like a very nice neighborhood restaurant and bar. A bit on the expensive side for me with dinner probably in the $15 - 30 range when all is said and done.

That much said I had the Prime Rib and it was very tasty along with a simple baked potato. 

Good service. Plenty of parking in their own lot."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. What else can you want? 
This is not a five star restaurant and the decor is home grown.
If you want to pay for splash, go someplace else."}
{"text":"My sons and I decided on a last minute lunch together and we ended up here. I think we were the 1st ones there but when we left it was about half full. It's decor is an 80's brass rails,  hunter green, and walls that are wooden. There is also a tall case filled with desserts that looked tasty. 
I ordered the Cobb Salad. When I said \"no tomatoes\" the waitress offered cucumbers instead. I asked for Blue Cheese Dressing. When the salad came out it was big. I only ate 1/3 of it. Everything was crisp and fresh. I believe the dressing was homemade. 
My youngest son ordered Chicken Strips and fries. There was a whole lot of chicken!!  It was golden brown and crispy. The coating was light and was a good proportion to the chicken. The fries were excellent. All 3 of is kept eating them. 
My oldest son ordered a gyro salad. It had a lot of gyro meat and he said the dressing was really good. It looked really good!  
So, good food, mediocre service and just ignore the decor. The only thing I didnt like was that they charged me $1.00 for the Blue Cheese dressing for my salad. It's been years since anyone has charged more for Blue Cheese dressing."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times, typical bar/restaurant setting. Inside can use a facelift in the restaurant area. Recently there in a Monday for lunch, relatively busy and only one Server. She did a great job but definitely was a delay in service. Something that surprised me though, we had 2 Caesar salad with chicken, a bowl of French onion soup and 2 soft drinks, and our bill was nearly $50. The food was good, not phenomenal and salad not worth $15 each. Didn't have dessert but have had in the past, and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, we sat at the bar, food was good. We'll definitely be back. Try the calamari."}
{"text":"Note: Getaway Cafe also serves breakfast from 8:30AM to Noon, but it's only on weekends. 

Believe it...or else, I've only been to Getaway Cafe a handful of times since they opened around 18 years ago (I believe this was a Fantastic Sam's hair salon before that), and Friday night marked my first visit (with Kay in tow of course) in at least 4 years. Each time I stopped in prior to the other night, I ordered the crabcake. Since then, they have stopped carrying the crabcake but have a host of other menu items to choose from including pasta, fajitas, BBQ ribs, Prime Rib, steaks, gyros, hoagies, burgers, and a brigade of different salads. 

I think I remember why I always ordered the crabcake; I could never decide upon what else to get. Once again, it's a Friday night (a pre-concert meal), and I'm stuck on what to order. 

Let me introduce you to The Baja Burger, a golem of ground chuck studded with diced (minced?) jalapenos. A flap of Swiss cheese acts as a cape, fried onions straws jut out like strange appendages, and a chipotle aioli (something that always makes me happy) plays the part of the lone condiment. 

There's a reason why so many burgers have standard builds, and the Baja Burger is one of them. 

The jalapenos and chipotle savage your tongue as you pierce the soft, succulent beef and crispy onions, punishing you for each bite, reminding you that this burger will not go meekly. A fantastic burger, its name is deceptively laid back; you're thinking The Eagles and get Guns 'n Roses instead. 

The house potato chips were likely the best house potato chips that have ever been reduced to particles by my teeth. Impeccably fried, the chips were stout, never drooped, held their shape, and revealed just how wonderful starch can be. Bagged potato chips are not an easy way out anymore, are they? The mandoline has arrived and snack foods will never again be the same. 

Kay, like me, hadn't the faintest idea what to order either, so I suggested a dish my mother ordered the last time I was here, one that I recalled sampling fondly: The Peachtree Peach. 

And it is so exquisitely Southern. A boneless chicken breast gets an egg wash. After being sauteed, it is deglazed with Georgia peach schnapps and is accompanied by peach slices. Kay, a Southern girl at heart, adored it for it is as tender and sweet as she is. She liked it so much, she started singing this POTUSA song, giggling all the while...

Here comes the missing star: Instant mashed potatoes. We both tasted 'em. 

All is forgiven when we shared a mammoth slice of their Towering Carrot Cake. Sour, yet sugary in terms of frosting; thick and carrot-riddled in body; unfathomably indulgent overall, a tandem assault wasn't enough to bring down this ultimate example of a classic dessert. Concede we did, calling for the styrofoam container with a quarter of it left. 

And how could I forget our appetizer? They call it Baked Feta. It's a pile of feta logs wrapped in a phyllo dough and...errr...baked like Shaggy after a rough night in the Mystery Machine. It's amazing how the bitter feta cheese takes on a lighter, more savory flavor and creamier mouthfeel after spending time in a hot oven. Lemon wedges and kalamata olives tag along. The marinara dipping sauce had more sass than Nell Carter at church in her Sunday best. God bless her by the way.  I miss her and her show. Tangents be damned...

What to say about the atmosphere and decor? \"Quaint\" might be an apt descriptor. Add \"congenial\" to the mix as well. Our server Marlene missed not a beat and like the best big sister we never knew, she made sure we didn't forget the rest of our carrot cake, which we almost did (Clutch on our brains...). The bar area in particular looks like it once served as a set for a sitcom. 

Getaway Cafe is even better than I remembered it being. It's just a damn shame about those mashed potatoes. Nevertheless, I hope that they're still in the business of making tasty food in 2029 and that business is good. 

Come...errr...Getaway!.

Wait, this ain't the Smiling Moose, but you dig, right?"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you really really WANT to like, especially if you live nearby.  I have been mostly underwhelmed by the food,except for their desserts which are perfection.  They have a very ambitious menu which perhaps does not give the cooks time enough to really focus on making fewer items really well. Sometimes the dinners are good, sometimes they are not. The salads are good.  I would only go there to meet a friend for a drink or attend an event that you are invited to, going there as dinner date is a real gamble, even if you do have a groupon."}
{"text":"so, we are on owner #3. haven't been going like we did in the past.  we finally decided to take another chance. while it looks the same, there have been a few changes. the nasty, yellowed ceiling tiles were replaced. they painted, & put in new flooring, floor pads in the kitchen & a few more kitchen updates. i  would suggest however, that they at least wash the booth fabric! you can see the years of dirty hands on the corners of the booth we were in. a lot of new staff too, but mickey is still there! we love her!
we asked about a bottle of red wine. the g.m. brought over 5 different bottles to choose from. they were decent wines, but they should have a just a smidge more variety. you can't really complain because they were only $25/bottle!
the menu was slightly changed, but the prime rib was back, just on weekends though. they used to have the BEST, used to. tom got the 14-oz. prime rib while i had the 10-oz. ribeye. we both asked for rare. the dinners came with a salad & a \"pick 1\" side. we got all of our food quickly. the salad was your basic salad. when the dinners came, & i looked at tom's plate, i  swear, it was still moving! (haha!) we like rare, but this was blue rare, like throw it on the fire for a few more minutes! tom doesn't like to make waves, so he said nothing. he had to saw through the meat! the seasoning was good, but not great. a guy at another table complained about his being too rare. the g.m. tried to comp it, but the guy said no. instead, they got a free round of drinks! my ribeye was kinda thin, which meant it was a little too done! DANG! we always have room for dessert here because they get their desserts from signature's bakery. LOVE the burnt almond torte! tom had a slice of the limoncello cake. so light after a big meal.
it seems as though this guy is trying to make it better. i think there are a few more wrinkles to iron out. we'll go again, at least once more, to give them a chance."}
{"text":"Great little bar/restaurant! They always have the games on, good crowd of people in the bar area and a very family friendly restaurant portion. 

They have live music sometimes, darts, juke box... typical get up. The service is prompt and friendly, they remember the regulars and the prices are very reasonable. Even the desserts are well worth your time! There is a private lot, plenty of parking, take cash and credit. 

Thursday nights there is a guy named John McCann who plays the guitar and sings, with other singers and musicians who come up and join in. 

Check them out, its a good night out! :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years on and off and sadly I can't say it's the same. It wasn't very busy at the bar and service took forever. Just to get menus and order our food it took about 25 min in itself. We ordered French onion soup, the fettuccini Alfredo,  and prime rib. Our soup took half an hour to come out. It tasted okay. The fettuccini was very bland and sadly not appetizing at all. The prime rib had fat all over it which needed to be cut off. That consisted of most of the meal. In the past appetizers have been okay, but that's the only thing I would probably get if we were to ever return."}
