{"text":"Love, love, love their hummus -  pricey but so worth it get from McEwans or Pusateris.   Discovered it through taste test in store and now buy religiously every weekend. Consider it my healthy treat.  Pair with Blackbird whole-wheat sourdough bread it's addictive"}
{"text":"I ordered Better than Yia Yia's for a small event recently and everything was delicious. I loved the grilled fish and the spanikopitas. But, the hummus and all of the sauces were out of this world. Seriously. There were even vegan dessert options that were super tasty. Will definitely use them again."}
{"text":"We used Better than Yia Yia's for catering for our rehearsal dinner at a downtown Toronto party room before our wedding day, and couldn't have been happier.  After shopping around a bit I found their prices very competitive, and the quality was terrific--all 55 people absolutely loved the food. Their servings were very generous and we ended up with lots of leftovers too--which is great, because the food is delicious! Deanna was a pleasure to work with and had excellent communication. Definitely recommend Better than Yia Yia's!"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek cuisine!  I tried the hummous, tzatziki, tirokafteri, melitzana and taramasalata, and was very impressed. Their desserts are very nice as well: I enjoy their baklava and kourambiedes with a cup of Loumides coffee.  I'm looking forward to trying their other menu items next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"I live on the Danforth so I have a lot to compare to when it comes to eating Greek food. I think the presentation and flavours are excellent. Some of my favourites are the potatoes (because they are lemony and greasy like most places), the sweets and especially the DIPS. Everything is always presented nicely but not pretentious or over the top. I've tried some of the foods from this caterer at parties where Greek food is not severed and I haven't been disappointed. They serve a variety of really healthy options to if you are having a party where people have many food allergies or restrictions."}
{"text":"we are addicted, and I mean addicted to the tzatziki and lemon hummus. They are to DIE FOR. Me and my daughter go to Mccewans just for these two items. the only downfall is they are 9.95 each, so you spend 20$ on dip. But well worth it. They go great with the blackbird breads.  DELICIOUS! we discovered them when they had a taste testing booth at the grocery store (mccewans) and we were hooked ever since :)"}
