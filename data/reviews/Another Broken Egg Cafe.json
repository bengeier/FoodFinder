{"text":"Sat for 2+ hours, got an app and then ignored, empty tables but wait at the door. Employees wander around while tables need busing. Not enough servers. Think about it.... 2 hours.... No food. I had to get my own drinks..."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the service on Sunday around noon was very inefficient. Make sure to call ahead at least two hours in advance. The restaurant was understaffed and servers were not proactive. There was wifi though."}
{"text":"Great service and good choices!  The veggie omelet was yummy. Next time I'll be decadent and try the Cinnamon Bun French Toast."}
{"text":"Had previously had poor service but tried again because the food is good. This time we ended up leaving as our kids were ready to go. We won't try again. 

Our drinks were wrong but the waitress was nice to fix, and she said \"everyone orders waffles on the weekends\" so that backs things up. After 50 minutes waiting - and they did realize we were waiting because they did give us beignets - we bailed. 

Hope they can learn from these reviews. We used to really like this place. Two times is a trend."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, of course.  That's their specialty.   Had salmon eggs Benedict with their homemade corned beef hash and a order  andouille sausage as a side.    Wife had the Hawaiian French toast.  We were both puzzles as to what made it Hawaiian?? All in all excellent.  Decent price and food was excellent."}
{"text":"We were excited to find this little cafe, right near our massage location, open early and can get a Bloody Mary!  Unfortunately the food was just ok.  Hash browns are deep fried and would be so much better if they were done on a flat top. The hollandaise sauce was broken too.  The service was friendly but really slow. Had to ask for refills and for our dirty plates to be removed. Left disappointed. The Bloody Mary was good and if they improved the professionalism of the staff and the food it could be a great place."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little breakfast cafe. The atmosphere is bright and cheery. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. The parking is limited considering the number of businesses in the area. I had to park near the Barnes N Noble and walk over, which made me a little late. When I arrived my friend already had a table. The waitress overheard me talking about the parking lot and said: \"yeah, the parking here sucks, but I'm glad you're here, can I bring you a Bloody Mary to help start your brunch off right?\" What a wonderful greeting! I love for someone to empathize with me and then immediately offer alcohol to console me!! I thought to myself, \"man, this woman is good!\" :-)

I had the Popeye's Favorite scramble: three eggs scrambled with spinach, onions, baked bacon and Monterey Jack cheese served with potatoes and an English muffin. I added a side of bacon, which was served extra crispy (just how I like it :-) 

The meal was very good and very filling. I didn't eat anything else for the rest of the day. I also had a mimosa, which wasn't very good. It tasted like it was made with cheap OJ and cheap champagne. I wouldn't order it again. 

My friend had the shrimp and grits. She said it was one of the best she's had.  Overall, this place is solid. Give it a try. You may have to search for parking, but it's worth the effort."}
{"text":"The food was so delish! I had the crab cakes and eggs Benedict with hollandaise dish (forgot the actual name), accompanied with a classic mimosa. I wanted to order the Rum Chata & Java but they ran out of the ingredients to make it. I also had the beignets with the orange marmalade which are also very good--definitely perfect for a sweet treat. The only downfall was the 45-50 min wait to get our table, which is to be expected for \"brunch time\" on a Sunday. It also took a bit longer than expected to receive our food, but it was worth the wait. The wait staff were very friendly, even with the influx of people waiting around. I can't wait to go back to try another dish! The menu has a lot of offerings for all appetites and dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Wow is the word that comes to mind.  We had salads for lunch and they rocked.  Not at all what you expect from a place with a name like this. Cannot wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Slow inattentive service. $11.00 for 
scrambled eggs, with little bacon pieces, onions, mushrooms, a little ham and Cheddar-Jack. 40 minute wait for a table for two and 35 minute wait for the food. We sat in the back room. Our food was brought to the table not by our server and for the first three times our server came back into the room, she didn't check on us. The 4th time she asked if we were ok but I was done at that point. The wait + the cost + the service = SKIP IT."}
{"text":"PRO: I wish I could remember my waitresses name because she was a hoot! But let's get to the food..I had a hankering for a fully loaded breakfast so I had the steak and egg breakfast with a side of city grits. Now that I sound as greedy as I felt sitting at breakfast alone stuffing my face, let me just say I felt absolutely NO guilty! It was worth every calorie and then some! I live nearby so this will be my little guilty pleasure! 
CON: it was early on a Friday morning the place had 2 other patrons and I had to wait a bit before anyone even came to seat me. But hey when they did it was only up from there!"}
{"text":"Friendly hostess. Cute atmosphere. Friendly and attentive sever. Ordered the Huevos Rancheros egg dish. Ok. Must be a southern take on it."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday with my boyfriend and his family.  We were a party of 11.  One of my boyfriend's relatives complimented the waitress several times, and she definitely deserved it.  She was attentive and very patient with us, as there were a lot of us.  While we were waiting, she made sure we had more coffee if we liked and refilled other drinks.

It took between 45 minutes and an hour for our food to come out after we ordered, which may have been because there were a lot of us, but breakfast food is usually ready pretty quickly also.  I had the biscuit and gravy meal, which was delicious overall.  The sausage patties were a bit on the burnt and crispy side, which is not my preference.  The biscuits were fluffy though and the sausage gravy was thick with plenty of sausage.  The potatoes were soft and seasoned just the right amount."}
{"text":"If you're expecting the Broken Egg experience as found in Destin, you'll be disappointed.  My eggs for eggs Benedict were overcooked, and the potatoes were straight from a bag in the freezer (unlike Destin where they were prepared in house).  Service was good and food was okay, but definitely not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Decided to try Another Broken Egg Café while in the area. The staff was super friendly and the décor reminded me of a New Orleans café. The first time visiting this place; my order started with a mimosa and beignets. The texture of the beignets was harder than expected. They could've been more light and airy. It didn't scare me off! When the waitress came back I ordered the Hey Lucy! Omelette (cooked w/egg white) and it was delicious! The waitress excitement about how much she like the Hey Lucy! was a reason to try it. Also, I love avocado! The omelette is filled with breakfast chorizo (crumbed sausage), avocado, sautéed onions, and green chilies. Also, topped with cheese, side of English muffin, sour cream and salsa. 

I decided to revisit Another Broken Egg with a friend because of my first experience. This time I ordered the Black Bean Benedict with another mimosa. The taste wasn't to my liking! The black bean benedict should be altered because it was to much going on with that dish.I sent it back!!! Just for the record the waitress was kind and understanding~ She simply asked if I would like to reorder and I did. My breakfast date ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast with coffee. The Banana Foster French Toast was amazing!!! The thick sliced Hawaiian bread was topped with a New Orleans-style Foster sauce, fresh bananas, pecans and whipped cream. SO DELICIOUS!! 

So how did I come up with giving this place 4 stars? The overall experience was pleasant. Both times the staff was extremely friendly, the mimosa was on point, and the food was pretty good. I will definitely revisit this place over a few local breakfast restaurants/cafe. The plan during my next visit is to stick with what I enjoyed the most. I will reorder a mimosa, either a different omelette, simple eggs, grits, fruit, or even the famous Bananas Foster French Toast. Remember everyone preference of flavors in food is not always the same! By the way the mimosas are the best!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé loves breakfast...me, not so much. We hit up Another Broken Egg around noon on a Saturday and both walked away happy. The hostess wasn't overly friendly and our waitress needed things to be repeated a few times before she heard the order correctly, granted it was crowded and on the louder side. I loved their ceramic pieces and found the decor to be very cute. I got a delicious omelet with egg whites and the perfect amount of feta. Their homemade sausage gravy was quite good, and my fiancé really enjoyed the  beignets, which were piping hot. I would personally choose to go back to Another Broken Egg before any other breakfast place in Charlotte but it didn't quite impress the fiancé enough to make it the top choice."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Another Broken Egg Cafe, so it is very convenient for brunch and breakfast. I have been there a handful of times and the food is generally pretty good. I wouldn't say it was anything great - but you will likely leave feeling satisfied when it comes to the food.

I have had a few of their items from waffles to omelets to eggs benedict. They have a pretty good selection of food and a lot of it sounds delicious! I would give the food a 3.5 stars if we could star food separately from service.

Service, however, is a different story. It seems like they do a poor job of managing how employees split tables to be able to give customers the service they deserve. I have never run into a bad employee - they are all incredibly nice. But the service that they provide in regards to timing is horrendous. 

Instead of having someone behind the bar full time, that employee is also running around to a bunch of others table, so the bar is left unattended 65% of the time it seems. And there has not been ONE time where I have gotten out of there in less than 1.5 hours. So if you want a quick brunch or breakfast, this is NOT the place.

One time our food took 45 minutes to come out for 3 of us. Since it took so long, they comp'd the meals, which was the right thing to do so I can appreciate that. And then just today, a woman came in and complained about how she had come in earlier today and was completely ignored by every employee. The manager had finally acknowledged her but still didn't get anyone to help. When she came back later, which is when i heard about this, they gave her the meal she ordered free and a $25 gift card because of the poor service. So again - they did the right thing.

One other woman was there waiting at least 30 minutes for her to-go meal, which they also gave to her free since it took so long. And just to lay out how the restaurant was - in the beginning of the morning, at the start of our 1.5 hour stint, it was pretty full. But at the end of these two to-go orders - the place was pretty much empty. I am surprised they are still in business the amount of free food they end up giving away due to the lack of service.

It just seems like this restaurant is dis-organized, needs better management and planning on the staffing side. But the employees are very nice every time that I have been, and they do have decent food. So there are positives and negatives. I just hope that they can get a little more organized and have their operation a little more put together.

I am also hoping that another breakfast spot makes its way around that part of southpark."}
{"text":"Egg - cellent omelette s!  I had a bacon and sausage combo.  I'm not a big fan of the usual home fries that come with breakfast dishes, these were different.  Everything was well presented, fresh and tasty.   And the service was friendly.  I had the omelette for lunch."}
{"text":"The second star was earned only because the food was very good.

We went here on a Sunday, later morning, so a wait for brunch was expected.  What wasn't expected, however, was how understaffed the restaurant would be during such a peak time.

We were told the wait would be 20 minutes, but it definitely got up over 30.  Near the end of our wait, the hostess came out to yell at one of the servers that she'd been sat, while a customer came to complain she'd been waiting 10 minutes for her bill.  Then we got inside and only about 2/3 of the tables were even being serviced.

I thought maybe perhaps a server or two called out, but then it took forever for the food to arrive after the order.  That suggests that the management team simply didn't have enough employees on schedule for the front or the back of the house.

How could you not anticipate that a breakfast restaurant would be busy around Sunday brunch?!

On the way out, we walked by several unserviced tables and a waiting line that had grown twice as long.  All in all, a failure on the part of management."}
{"text":"Good but overpriced.  Spent $36
Same as IHOP where I spend $20 for 2 people.

Service was excellent and buttermilk pancakes were amazing"}
{"text":"This place suuuucked! Wanted to try a new breakfast restaurant since I was tired of going to the same ones all the time, so thought I'd try this place. We were seated in a back room where the tables were literally right up against each other. There was no on right next to us so I thought it would be ok. 5 mins later they sat someone right up against us. I don't understand this... Why do hostesses think anyone wants to sit right against another full table. My back was literally 1 inch from the guy next to me. Very uncomfortable! 

We ordered our food.. I got a French toast combo and the wife got an omelette and potatoes. The potatoes were tasteless.  They basically were just French fries with no seasoning. Horrible. The omelette was just bleh...  French toast was also just bleh.. Had no taste at all. The homemade sausage patties were ok, but way over seasoned. They tasted more like a meatball. Very weird. Everything was just barely ok... But far from good.  

The only thing I liked was the coffee. 

Total bill for my wife, 2 young kids, and myself was over $50. Way overpriced for breakfast... Especially a tasteless one. 

I wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for an omelette. Food was good,  but not worth the price. And definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain. We have eaten here on numerous occasions but today was the worst. I think our waiter was new so he tried hard. It took very long to get our meal. Group of 8. 4 people asked about beverage refills but then no one brought them. Pancakes were dry, syrup container was clogged and nasty, over easy eggs were over cooked so not a great experience today. No mangers were asking how things were. I think they must have been in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Overpriced and they use egg batter. Make sure you read the fine print in the menu. Save yourself some money and go to waffle house."}
{"text":"Excellent meal.
After a few appointments this morning my Mom and I decided to try this place just up the street from where she lives.  Well it did not disappoint.  We enjoyed pancakes, eggs and turkey sausage and the city grits (Oooh!!! the bacon bits added a sumptuous flavor).  Best grits I've had to date in Charlotte. Great hot coffee too. I love the bright decor.  Service was great as well with smiling attendants.  I'm sure going on a Sat. or Sun. you'd have a bit of a wait, but if you can stop in after the morning rush hour, it's heavenly.  It's my new favorite breakfast spot and we can't wait to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Asked for our drinks three times, finally got one but cancelled the other because I didn't want to pay for a thirty minute wait. The food was fast, efficient and very delicious unlike the service. If you have two hours to waste, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  The staff was excellent the decor was wonderful, the restrooms are clean.  I enjoyed the special ceramic coffee mugs which are artistic and everyone is  an individual.  Nice touch. 

I had two scrambled eggs which were good, bacon which was excellent, potatoes which were passable. English muffin which was excellent.  I thought the coffee was much better than I was expecting.  Others at my table enjoyed all their selections.

The French donuts were perhaps the best I've had outside of New Orleans.  It's worth the trip here to try them. Powdered sugar and a special dip for them as well.

For those that are interested, it is a franchise. The original was called \"broken egg Café\".  The franchise locations are called \" another broken egg Café.\"

Outdoor seating looked great. But we ate inside.  Certainly better than the typical trip to IHOP.  Probably a little more expensive as well."}
{"text":"The prices here are in sane these people are crazy for the amount of money they charge for eggs I would not recommend this place to anybody it is highly over priced it is so expensive money money money money it is expensive bring a lot of money money money money."}
{"text":"I have never been treated so rudely in my life . Helena was extremely rude when I tried to call ahead. She kept saying they were busy, asked me how far away I was. I told her we were on our way, we live 5 minutes away, and she continued to ask if we would be there in 30 minutes. I've done a call ahead almost every weekend for brunch and she  was very sarcastically explaining to me how a call ahead worked. All the while she was very sarcastic and short. When we gave her our last name she replied, is that it??? I told her we wouldn't be coming in because she was so rude. She said fine, they were really busy."}
{"text":"I was here last Thursday, when my friend and I were searching for a casual brunch spot to fill up our afternoon. We had never tried it, but decided to take a chance. The website made up our mind for us, actually - it's an aesthetically pleasing, impressive one. Worth a look.

When we arrived, the restaurant was surprisingly empty, maybe two or three other tables taken. This worried us until we sat down, ordered a Monster Cinnamon Roll and were sold on the menu.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benny and he ordered the Southwest Scramble. Both were incredible, and my salmon was done just right. The capers also added a little bit of extra, unexpected flavor. The eggs (arguably the most important part) they served us were done fantastically, and we could tell that they were fresh. They were so fresh, in fact,  that the man in the booth behind us was telling his waiter about finding feathers in his. We still don't know if this was a joke or not...

All in all, it did seem sort of expensive for brunch, but it's absolutely worth the trip and the money. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our Parents of Allergic Kids members were discussing safe breakfast options. One of our members said:


\"The broken egg cafe off ballanytyne commons has been a safe place for us. (P/tn). The manager will work with you to prepare in separate pans. We've had pancakes, bacon, eggs, hash brown potato cubes, boniest here\"

Thank you for taking food allergies so seriously, it's appreciated."}
{"text":"Had their gravy and biscuit plate and their valentines special dish of chicken and waffles and both were awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast food. Nice waitress, but long wait times for drinks and food. Be prepared to wait 30-45 minute for your order to arrive. The food made up for the delay, however. We'll definitely come again when visiting the area."}
{"text":"This place received some questionable reviews in a few of the local rags....let me tell they were wrong. This place has awesome food and the service has always been outstanding. Highly recommend the huevos rancheros with chorizo. One way ticket to flavor town!"}
{"text":"The service here was pathetic, doesn't matter how good or bad the food is if it takes an hour to get it after you order it."}
{"text":"Folks from the Midwest or Gulf Coast may recognize ABE as a knock-off of Egg Harbor Cafe (down to the plateware). With so much promise, though, ABE just doesn't deliver. If ever there was a restaurant in need of a good manager, it's here. We've visited five or six times (the allure of another breakfast spot like this near South Park is that strong a draw), but each time has been an inordinately bad service experience. We've only once been greeted by a hostess at the front door, and have a few times circles the restaurant twice while the waitress/host tries to decide where to sit us. The food is average-to-good, and with a better oiled machine might appeal even more. But a year's worth of effort, and ABE seems to be stuck in 2nd gear. 

There are too many other good options nearby, including OPH and especially now Dogwood."}
{"text":"Don't try the lemon poppyseed French toast! It's Sara Lee type pound cake grilled on one side with poppyseeds sprinkled on top. Keep you $11.99."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for the family! Just had a wonderful meal, with great service! I would advise persons who come to this location to be prepared for an additional wait, but trust me it is worth the wait! I suggest the Belgian Bananas Foster style"}
{"text":"We are often there for breakfast with my husband. They skinny omelet is really good,  i got so hooked up on it that I don't know much about other items. Their Coffee tastes like evey other breakfast place, kind of medium. Not too bad, not too good. They have nice outdoor seeting area. Overall it is decent place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just average at best... not a big fan but it's a place in our breakfast place rotation."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place... It's just not a good place. $10 for two way overdone scrambled eggs, two pieces of way underdone bacon, a barely toasted English muffin, and some deep fried pieces of food service potatoes. Throw in a tip and you have a $12+ plate of mediocrity. Coffee is good, and service is ok but it just isn't worth the price tag."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and sadly will be my last.  While the food was pretty good - it certainly doesn't make up for the service.  We arrived to a restaurant that wasn't fully seated but was on a wait.  Once we were seated at our table, it took 30 minutes to get the bloody mary's that were ordered.  The food took another 30 minutes - so we ended up being at the restaurant from 10:40am until 1:00pm.  Kind of ridiculous for a restaurant that wasn't super busy on a Monday morning."}
{"text":"Poached egg still had clear juice running out of it from an eggs Benedict. Asked for mustard and they brought me Dijon that was expired and asked for regular mustard and it was brick hard in the packets. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Another Broken Egg originally started out as as the Broken Egg Cafe in Mandeville, Louisiana back in 1996 and has grown steadily across the country ever since. We rarely pass up an opportunity to check out a new restaurant so we made our reservations and were on our way.

We started breakfast with the Baked Brie Delight with Apples, pecans & raisins sautéed in a Grand Marnier butter sauce over warm Brie cheese with toasted French bread. This was definitely the best part of our breakfast. The cheese was perfectly warm, soft. and gooey while the sautéed apples added the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the salty cheese. I usually see baked brie wrapped in puff pastry, but serving this dish with toasted bread added a crunch to the dish that really made it stand out.

Ella got the Belgian Waffle with strawberries and bananas with a side of eggs and bacon. The waffle was delicious, but I have not had many waffles that are not. The strawberries and bananas were fresh and added a touch of fruitiness to a sticky sweet dish. The part that really stood out was the bacon. It was nice and thick and full of flavor.

I decided to step way out of my comfort zone and get the Benedict Oscar with Grilled flat iron steak, two poached eggs topped with garlic sautéed crabmeat & asparagus with Béarnaise. I hate seafood... and I'm not very keen on asparagus, but despite those shortcomings I really enjoyed this plate. It did seem a little heavy for a breakfast plate but the flat iron steak and and sautéed crabmeat were absolutely delicious. The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy were the side lack luster side of squishy potatoes.

Another Broken Egg is a tremendous step above the average breakfast restaurants. The food was incredibly fresh and the menu was diverse without being overbearing. Its not a good spot if you're in a hurry but if you want to kick back and relax while eating something delicious first thing in the morning then Another Broken Egg is a good spot to check out."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Today's was definitely a miss. Food is typically okay. Breakfast this morning was so overly salted it made us both sick to our stomachs. Nothing needs THAT much salt.  Complained to the staff. No manager in sight.  Our last time there."}
{"text":"Today was a lot like the other two times I've been to this restaurant.  Food is good but simply not worth the 45 minute wait (at the table), the poor service and the screwed up bill.  Charlotte simply has too much to offer, for anyone to put up with this over a waffle and some beignets.  Not going back."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast experience every time. I usually get the Hey Lucy omelette or the Southwest omelette. The beignets are awesome as well. The coffee is good, but not strong enough. Overall I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in on a saturday morning pretty early and got seated with no wait at all. Started out with some beignets which were not really all that great prob would not order them again, just not what you are expecting when you think of beignets. Otherwise everything else was great! Waiter was friendly and food didnt take long place started to fill up after we placed our orders. We got the cinnamon roll french toast.....man talk about good! Also a veggie omelet will be back for sure to try something else"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come in for a late breakfast. The staff was amazing! Especially our waitress Eloisa. Her accent is adorable but her service was exceptional. The food came out perfectly delicious! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Encouraged by an interesting menu, I wanted to give them another opportunity since my last visit their a few months ago.  I won't be back for a third time.  As was consistent with my first experience, the service was poor including earning the attention of the server, the accuracy of our order, and the quality of the food.

Once we were approached by a server she took our drink orders and returned with three out four drinks as correct.  Additionally, she provided my 6 year-old daughter a large, adult cup rather than one with a top.  Once our food arrived, my wife and I both noted ours was very cold (but was supposed to be hot).  My order was incorrect and when pointed out to the server, she returned with the wrong side item again yet charged me for the higher priced side item I didn't receive.

Frankly, I'm shocked they remain in business given what I expect is a consistent experience for other patrons.  I know with certainty that I will not visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Like some other reviewers, I didn't initially realize this was a chain until I scoped their website looking for a menu preview (what, like you don't do the same thing?). My mom was in town for a visit, and we decided to give it a whirl as a change of pace from our usual brekkie joint, Toast of Dilworth.

The food was pretty decent. I had the veggie/goat cheese omelet, which was a little light on veg for my tastes, but overall well-balanced. Grits were good and thick, and my sub rye toast (instead of the ubiquitous english muffin), thickly sliced, was appropriately crisp and crunchy.

Mom and Hubs both seemed to enjoy their breakfasts, and we all had a lot of leftovers by the time we were full.

The only sticking point was the speed of service. Everything seemed slower than it should be (and it did not seem very busy), and it took forever to get the check. My mom, treating us, got tired of waiting for the server to come pick up her card, so she finally just threw down some cash and made to leave. *That's*when the server came hurrying over. 

Again, I will stress that the food was good and plentiful - just don't come here if you're on a limited time budget. 'Leisurely' is the name of the game, I guess."}
{"text":"Wasn't able to even order, was sat by the host and waited 10 minutes wherein 2 waitresses and the host walked by without acknowledging my presence. Only 5 tables had patrons so not sure the malfunction. Went to Metro Diner 10 minutes down the road and was seated and served immediately."}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon Benedict is on the money!
Or those who don't comprehend, in other words, it was fantastical!"}
{"text":"My wife and I called ahead a breakfast order to eat at Another Broken Egg restaurant.  When we arrived, the bartender man said we couldn't keep calling ahead our breakfast!  I asked why, he replied we are too busy.  It was not busy in the restaurant. There were only around ten people eating in the whole restaurant. There were many tables open and unoccupied!

Furthermore, he was rude and argumentative with us justifying his wrong bullying behavior!!! I have never felt so unwelcome and treated poorly like this morning.  We will not eat there any longer!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this restaurant in Charlotte and will definitely go back to the Raleigh location. The menu has lots of options and everything looked great. I got an omelette which was very good- also liked their potatoes and andouille sausage.

The gluten free pancake and egg scrambles were also great. If you go, do NOT pass up the beignet appetizer! It was very popular at our table! Looking forward to trying more options here."}
{"text":"Love the cosy, home-y atmosphere. Great place to relax and have some nice comfort food, like sausage gravy biscuits with potatoes and eggs. I got the Chobani Tuile bowl - a bowl made out of a cookie filled with yogurt and fruit!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok. Had the southwest scramble, and my friend the biscuits and gravy. Our waiter didn't really seem to want to be there."}
{"text":"Service and staff was fine/friendly.  However, our bill was $54 for 4 people (2 adults and 2 children).  This place is WAY OVER PRICED!!  The food was very average and not unique and for it to be that expensive for breakfast it should have been.  This place is just to much money for breakfast food.  We don't mind spending money on food but it has to be good and this just was not very good."}
{"text":"Out of business!!! Remove this listing so no one else wastes their time driving 40 minutes here like I just did."}
{"text":"Not a good experience on a Sunday morning.  There are three hostesses up front but not enough servers on the floor.  25% of the tables are empty but customers are waiting in a line up front to be seated.  A simple order of eggs and sausage came out ice cold.  

Coffee is great... wish I could get a refill."}
{"text":"Best brunch location I've been to in Charlotte! They had the best French toast which is my favorite. They also had a great rating posted for cleanliness (97 or 98). The waiter did check on us often but the food was delicious! I definitely plan on going back very soon."}
{"text":"Ambiance of this place is totally cool

Iris was our server and very bright and personal

Coffee was excellent

We started with the Cinnamon roll at Iris's suggestion and it was the absolute bomb

Mrs had Granola Quinoa and fruit

After a struggle to decide between the southwest scrambler or eggs Benny I chose to go the healthy route and went with Steel Cut Oatmeal

This place is a have to when in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to reflect my last two experiences here at Another Broken Egg Café. Both visits were on Sunday mornings around 10 AM which, arguably, is probably their weekly peak. However, on both occasions, our wait times were extraordinary despite seeing many unoccupied tables from the lobby. 

On our latest visit, my wife and seven-year-old daughter and I were seated with three adult menus; we had to ask two different staff for a kids menu. It then took about 30 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered it and, when our orders arrived, they were all cool as if they had been sitting for a while. By that time we were so hungry we did not complain. 

On the earlier of the two visits, our service was so slow that the manager offered to comp our meal. We did not take her up on the offer because we figured it was a fluke and she was trying her best to manage the situation.

Are there factors such as variety and quality that justify dining in a place despite subpar service? Sometimes yes. However, my wife and I agree that there are other nearby options that deliver an overall richer breakfast experience than Another Broken Egg Café. We do hope that they are able to address their service and quality issues as their menu is unique in our area."}
{"text":"I like the environment of the place, such as their artwork and other aesthetics. It was a relaxed atmosphere you would think of for a casual brunch. This was a Sunday afternoon and the place was full but it wasn't crowded. This was my first time here. 

The prices were slightly overpriced in my opinion, but this is very normal for the area in general in Charlotte. So, I suppose you can say it was averagely priced. I would guess that most of the entrees were right at $10.00. Not great, but not horrible. The menu was full of interesting styles of egg dishes, and various pancakes, toasts, and even some sandwiches and burgers.

I got the veggie burger and was pleasantly surprised. It was like a veggie burger/ black bean burger hybrid, with avocado, onion, and tomato. It was really good and this is why I am now a fan of this place.  It's a gamble when ordering a veggie burger as many places just heat up something from a box like Morningstar Farms (which I like by the way, but preferably it's not what I want if I eat out). This veggie burger wasn't too messy and it wasn't a brick. It was perfect in my opinion.  The homestyle potato chunks or whatever you call them also were very good and had a tasty seasoning that had me licking my lips. My friend got the veggie scrambled eggs (I don't remember exactly what it was called) and although I didn't try a bite, I will say that she enjoyed them and they looked awesome. If they can hold the mushrooms, it's near the top of my list of menu items to try next time I go, although the sweet potato pancakes also looked interesting. 

All in all, I am a fan of the environment and food. That brings me to the staff. We entered and the hostess told us it would be a 15 minutes wait, but we only waited about 2 minutes. They address us by name after asking what they were which immediately gave me a good impression and a friendly vibe. The waiter was super nice and wasn't bothersome or neglectful. It did take slightly longer than usual to receive the food after it was ordered. I have noticed this has has been a common complaint on these reviews, so that tells me it's not unusual. Also, one lady at a table near me, when receiving her order, asked them if they had to kill the chicken. So if you are thinking of eating here, just know that it's good food but you may have to wait longer than expected. Personally, I can deal with it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Although the place is pretty cute and the service awesome, the food was pretty unimpressive. I had the Beignets for appetizer and although they came out quickly they weren't warm at all, as they should be, And the marmalade it came with wasn't good at all. I had the pancakes with eggs and bacon. The pancakes tasted like the ones at Dennys (aka like frozen cheap pancakes). My friend tried the huevos rancheros which looked pretty good and I think she enjoyed. I would come back to try some of their other dishes but probably not anytime soon since there are a lot more breakfast places around me I still need to explore."}
{"text":"Food was quite honestly nothing special at all. Most of it seemed pre-cooked and its most definitely not healthy at all. Place was dirty. 

What finally made me give this two stars was the service. It was absolutely horrible, it took nearly an hour to get two waffles out and they were warm too. Not hot! The person waiting on us didn't seem to want to work there. People like him cause people like me to leave bad reviews. If you don't want to to work leave. Don't ruin the experience for everyone. I won't be back. Lot of health code violations in there too."}
{"text":"It's been 45 minutes and they haven't served us our food. We noticed everyone around us who sat after us was being served. When asked why it was taking so long, the waitress said because our party was so large. We have 7 people.... Considering walking out."}
{"text":"We actually first tried this place in ATL and wasn't impressed as the service sucked and we were nickled and dimed for every little thing from the syrup on the side (warm) to the separation of the fruit from the waffle (REALLY?!).. We were totally turned off and planned to never visit again however one morning we saw that the old breakfast restaurant (which we didn't like) had change to Another Broken Egg & decided to try it in NC. 
The service was good, the hostess was welcoming and prompt to acknowledge and sit us. We found some great options on the menu and the waiter was very accommodating. The food was not the best but it was food and edible. I had a egg white omelet with veggies and rye toast that came out untoasted which the manager quickly took it back and toasted the bread for me. My husband had the same and my daughter had the pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs with cheese and some bacon (she is the only pork eater in the family).
I wouldn't make having breakfast here a DEFINITE but I wouldn't object if invited. I have other places that are much better with food taste within distance that I would eat at if I had a choice. However if in the area (on that block or in the parking lot) definitely check them out for breakfast food which is all that we tried."}
{"text":"Okay, Another Broken Egg Cafe, we're done.  It's not me, it's you.  Really.

We've been a handful of times over the past couple of years since they opened.  At first, it seemed like a great addition to our list of breakfast places.  However, they've been going downhill for quite awhile now, and I say enough's enough.

I've tried various breakfast menu items here, but nothing has ever wowed me.  Breakfast is my favorite meal, and for nothing to wow me from a breakfast place with egg in their name is pretty sad.  The Eggs Benedict is so-so.  The Black Bean Benedict is dry.  The Andouille sausage is gristly.  The crawfish too fishy and suspect.  The omelets are just plain amateur-looking .  And the breakfast potatoes have never been anything but bland (no seasoning whatsoever) and overcooked.  

This past weekend we went.  We arrived and were, surprisingly, almost promptly seated.  We just had to wait for the server to clean off her own table, which took longer than it should have.  No bus boy?  How about the lazy teenage boy walking around pretending to be a host occasionally?  Or maybe the manager wandering around pretending to look busy, but never really doing anything?  

It took us awhile to order and then even longer to get our meals. One of the kids ordered the Cajun Crawfish Skillet, and he even pointed to it on the \"special\" menu so our server could see what he wanted.  After about 20 minutes, another server came by (not too happy) because apparently the kitchen had asked her (instead of our own server) to ask what kind of potato skillet he wanted.  He was confused (as we were) as the miscellaneous server rattled off some options.  He picked some and she ran away.  I then went to grab a menu from the host stand, because it all seemed odd.  That's when we realized that our server must have put in the build-your-own potato skillet into the machine instead of the Cajun Crawfish Skillet.  But...wouldn't the machine ask you for the items for the build-your-own potato skillet?  Anyway, we chased down the 2nd server and explained what must have happened.  She said she'd advise the cooks.  The food came out after much more waiting and our server said \"The Cajun Skillet\" as she placed the plate down.  However, it wasn't the Cajun skillet.  It had the items that he had told the 2nd server out of confusion.  We brought this to our server's attention a few minutes later and she said that he had only ordered the potato skillet, not the Cajun skillet?  What?  First, if he HAD ordered the build-your-own potato skillet, she never asked what he wanted in it.  Second, when she delivered the plate, she specifically called it the Cajun one!  She offered to have the kitchen make the correct one, but we didn't have another 45 minutes to waste.  We just asked her to make sure we weren't charged for the higher-priced one he DID originally order.  

Yes, she brought us some complimentary beignets after we had waited there for over 30 minutes for our breakfast food.  And they were good.  But everything else was, as usual, bland.  My Bacquezo omelette (one of the only things I've tried that has any resemblance of flavor) looked like a five-year-old made it.  The accompanying potatoes were -- as usual -- bland, unseasoned, and dry.  The English muffin was slightly warmed, but nowhere near toasted.  When you're charging a few dollars more per item than IHOP, don't you think you should step up your game?   And how sad is it when IHOP outdoes your breakfast options in both presentable and flavor, and comes out 10x quicker?  

All in all, we were there for an hour and a half and had only a tolerable experience.  So, yes.  We're over, Another Broken Egg Cafe."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Their menu selection, at face value, is great for breakfast/brunch and the service we had at our most recent visit here was amazing as well. It's just the food itself tastes like it is missing something. I've been to their location in Raleigh and most recently gave it another shot in Charlotte as well. Speaking to the food, both times, it was just so blah. I had the biscuits and gravy along with the Supreme skillet. The biscuits themselves were fairly ok but the gravy was a little on the runny side. Some people may like that but I'm more  of a \"spoon stands straight up in it\" gravy kinda guy. The Supreme skillet I got had sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, cheese and eggs but everything seemed a little dried out. Beyond the lack of moisture it tasted just sort of bland. Not sure if one ingredient was lacking or several but it just didn't do it for me. On a high note though, I do have to give props for their biscuit beignets. Those sugar and honey covered little devils were amazing."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I have never had an omelet that has such great flavor. Definite coming back to this place!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning around 10 and arrived to a full parking lot but got lucky and found a spot. Walked in and there were people already waiting.  We waited about 10-15 minutes and than we were seated. The food came out pretty fast.  I ordered a southwest scrambler and beignets and my fiancé order the French toast and some city grits. My food was very good came with guacamole and salsa and two tortillas. The beignets were ehh okay. The sauce it came with was very weird. My fiancé loved her French toast and LOVED her city grits. She was full but wanted to ask for more grits cause they were good. The city grits had pieces of bacon and green onion it looked like.  Place was very good and worth a try."}
{"text":"Came in for a breakfast with my 10 year old Monday and had to leave before we were able to finish due to the couple sitting directly behind us.  They we making out so loudly and were inappropriately discussing their plans for the day with no worries about who was around them.  My head was inches from theirs and I was mortified by their actions.  It was apparent that the waitress was uncomfortable as well.   I feel management should have done more to intervene in this situation.  Breakfast and a porn show was not on my agenda for today."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, my first being the Ballantyne location. We arrived at 1:30, which was 30 minutes before their 2pm closing time. But we were seated right away. The server was very nice and accommodating and it reflected in my tip. My friend ordered the fried green tomato BLT, and couldn't stop raving about how good it was. And she is very particular about food. I ordered the basic 2 egg, bacon and potatoes which was also very good. I always ask for soft scrambled eggs and no matter where I go, no one seems to get that right. But they were good. The bacon was crispy and the potatoes were not as good as the Ballantyne location. They seemed more bland but I still enjoyed them. Over all, I like this place and will certainly go back. My reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 would be the prices, which are a little steep. But not outrageous."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I ordered an Omelette which was absolutely superb! The potatoes were perfect! Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. That with my sweet tea will set you back $12 so to save a few bucks I'll just get water next time. The service was also very good and the food itself is worth the price. I hope my next visit is just as positive."}
{"text":"The sweet potato pancake was better than expected. It's not too sweet or too spicy. The service was solid and dependable.  ... Come with an empty stomach and a full wallet (prices for breakfast are high)"}
{"text":"This place was delicious ! Even for Sunday brunch and with a wait, it was so worth it! Great serious with delicious food! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I got a plate of Bacon and eggs(2) with home fries with a toasted bagel, which was not in the menu.  Simple and plain nothing can go bad with bacon n egg.  The problem was the \"Fresh\" orange juice was not fresh as the ones I'm more familiar with, but I did not wanted to make fuss out of it.  I almost flipped out of my chair when I got the bill.  $10.48 for bacon n eggs (little pricey), $7.78 for 2 small cups of Orange Juice????!!!!!  This is my first review in Yelp, I never cared to leave comments but i hope anybody that choose to drink OJ over a coffee for breakfast, like me, should walk in with a bottle of Tropicana and walk out with it."}
{"text":"The food was great. The wait was absolutely terrible. Not sure if they didn't have enough staff that particular weekend. The hostess seemed a bit disorganized which created further confusion with the costumers that was waiting. For example, after was told the wait was 15 mins which turned out to be more than an hour. After being seated the manager did apologize and got our food out quickly."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. There was a bit of a wait but it was a nice day so we were able to sit outside until our table was ready. The place was packed so we really had high hopes! 

I'd been before and enjoyed my food but this time I thought everything was just okay. I ordered the Lobster and Brie omelet and we split a waffle with strawberries. I'd had the omelet before and really enjoyed it....but this time it wasn't my favorite. Perhaps because it seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. Our waffle was burnt on one side and came topped with a pitiful one strawberry cut in small slivers....really? The same with the potatoes...just okay. 

I left a bit bummed, but I'd be willing to give them another try but not go out of my way to suggest it as a \"go-to\" brunch spot."}
{"text":"No stars.  Should not be affiliated with ABE Cafe's found along the Gulf Coast.  Hard beignets, burnt toast, lukewarm food with no garnishment.  Steak N Shake has much better skillets!  

Service is okay.  Obvious why there is no wait during peak brunch times.  We went on a Saturday and the place was a ghost town."}
{"text":"I came for brunch over the weekend and the service was good. The food was just okay. 

I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette which comes with avocado, chorizo, onions, green chilies and then topped with cheddar jack cheese. 

Well...mine didn't have the cheese (see photo) but overall the dish was just missing something. It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream but i still needed something more. Seasoning? Flavor? For my side, I chose the country potatoes and they were cold - but I did sample the city grits so if I return I'd chose that side instead of the potatoes. 

Overall, the food for me was just two stars. But everyone was so friendly so I threw in an extra star. But this wouldn't be my main brunch spot."}
{"text":"Wait time is insane but the dining space isn't the largest. My mom got some kind of blackberry French toast it was amazing she kept raving about it but couldn't finish it all. The eggs weren't her favorite but the ham was a perfect match a little salt for her sweet. I got the crab cake and fried green tomatoes! Oh boy the spinach salad was good enough to have by itself I'll be ordering that again! My friends both got omelets southwest and lobster they enjoyed their food to say the least we had a great experience. Call ahead to get your name on the list if you're coming on a weekend as the brunch crowd has grown in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I had the crab cakes egg Benedict. Not a great texture, was like imitation crab meat. The server wasn't the best. She was short and inattentive. I wouldn't suggest it but if I was invited wouldn't be hating life either. It could have been what I ordered. Perhaps if I would have ordered pancakes or something simple, it would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The staff is always so friendly and it's good but also quick. Can get busy so don't wait til you're starving during rush.  You may wait."}
{"text":"After having a great time the night before, a few of us decided to visit Another Broken Egg for breakfast. Being upfront, I judge breakfast on Biscuits and Gravy. We knew that a Saturday morning could be problematic so we called ahead to see if we could get reservations. The answer was no, but the waitress was able to put us down on the \"call ahead list\". 

When we got there the place was packed, so I'm glad we did get on that list. We were seated right away and after ordering caffeine, everyone else ordered an omelet type dish, while I ordered my signature biscuits and gravy. 

When the food came not too long after my meal also had an egg, English muffin, and bacon. The biscuits and gravy were ok, nothing to write home about. I was actually jealous of everyone else's and they all said they were good. 

The bill ended up being around $15, which is kind of pricey for breakfast. I probably wouldn't come back for the biscuits and gravy, but i might try again for those omelets."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Charlotte. The food was great, service was good. So why did I give it 3 stars. Well, when I checked my bank account... the tip I left and the tip I was charged did not match. I'll probably just pay with cash next time."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, i was a little leery about trying this place. We originally chose another restaurant for brunch, but people were lined up outside so we decided to pass. When we checked in at Another Broken Egg Cafe we were told there would be a 20 minutes wait. Since that would probably be our wait time anywhere, we decided to stay. It turns out we had to wait less than 10 minutes. Both my meal and my husband's were delicious. The portions were generous. Our server kept our coffee cup full. I did think it was a little pricey for brunch at $33 without tip, but that is what you would pay anywhere in Southpark."}
{"text":"We got the chance to eat here on our way out of town. The selection was perfect for our group of diverse tastes. My husband got a hamburger for breakfast and my dad ordered the lobster omelet (said it was delicious, though it sounds gross). They also had a selection of gluten free choices! The gluten free pancake with berries was great! Kids had typical pancakes and eggs- neither really ate well, but they are kids and you can't always count on them to be big eaters. The older child asked for chocolate chips on her pancake and they happily obliged. Only draw back, I had to ask for a refill of coffee every time, and the children's drinks got ignored completely. Though otherwise it was great!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this restaurant but if they do not get a FOH manager that knows what they are doing this place will not succeed. This is the third time we have tried to place an order to go, not only does it take 7-8 mins for someone to answer the phone, they ask to place you on hold to get a bartender and then no one ever picks up. To go food is one of the easiest ways to make $$ but if someone does not step up and run the front like a true manager you are going to have a lot of people passing up in dining either in house or to go."}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere different in our brunch rotation. The place is very colorful, inviting and clean. Did not take long to be seated and the host was kind. Our server did not ask us if we had been before, but once known they recommended some dishes. We tried skillet,&cinnamon roll French Toast. Although the food was tasty, over $10 for French Toast is steep. To make any dish a combo ( egg?? - tasted& looked like Eggbeaters  +protein) is an additional $3.19. Regular coffee is over $2.50. Needless to say we are not in the business of spending over $35 ( before tip) for breakfast for two and no buffet like Heist Brewery. Service was decent, but at times we were forgotten. I would go back;however,prices will keep us from coming every week for regular breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Eh . . I'm not sure. After hearing the rest of my family rave about it for weeks I finally had the chance to try it when I was in town visiting mom.  At 10:30am on Friday there was only a very short wait. After we were seated. It took a while for our  drink order to be taken but that's not a big deal. The coffee was very good and the beignets are SO good, seriously. . . order yourself some beignets you will NOT be sorry. After that things sort of went down hill for me. Mom's omelet was very good. My beef and seafood benedict just . . . wasn't. The English muffin was soggy and rubbery. The crab/seafood mixture was awfully 'fishy' and the hollandaise sauce was really REALLY lemony and didn't sort well at all with the crab/seafood mixture. The beef was very good but didn't really make up for the soggy rubbery English muffin. All in all just not good. I'm aware that some of this may just be me ordering poorly. But I've had lots of benedicts in lots of different places and the good ones always have a nice cutable with a fork English muffin. I'm very willing to try them again and am totally open to giving them 4 stars but for now I'm going to go with 3. They are also a bit on the expensive side 40 something dollars for breakfast for two and an appetizer seems a bit much. But it is Ballantyne so . . yeah. I'll be back (if for no other reason for the beignets) but so far I'm not really whelmed by anything else."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. The service is always spot on (ask for Beverly!) and the food is really good. I love the potatoes that come as a side. I am a sucker for some good potatoes and these are right up there, plenty of crisp and a little spice, but not too much. 

I am a plain Jane breakfast kind of girl so I typically stick to the traditional bacon and eggs and I am always satisfied. Hubs likes to try different menu items and the menu does not disappoint for that. 

It has quickly become our new regular breakfast spot."}
{"text":"When this place was Skillets, we came on several occasions and it was always hit or miss. So, when we found out Skillets had closed and a new restaurant was coming in, we had high hopes that this place would be even better than Skillets. After my visit, I don't think that is going to be the case. 

On my visit, the food was properly prepared and nothing was outright bad, but it wasn't great either.  It was ok. However, I thought the menu options were \"meh\" and the prices were a bit higher than other comparable breakfast/brunch places in the area. 

I opted to go with the veggie omelet which included spinach, goat cheese, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes. (I think it was either 8.99 or 9.99) This comes with potatoes and an English muffin. The first couple of bites of my omelet were sort of bland because the ingredients were sort of clumped together instead of being spread throughout the omelet.  One thing that was disappointing is that it was sort of \"watery\" (?!) and I had to move my English muffin away from the omelet so it wouldn't get soggy... not good!  But as I got to the center of the omelet, I actually began to get some of the flavors from the goat cheese & veggies that improved the overall taste.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the potatoes taste like bland frozen potatoes... definitely needs improvement! Also, the English muffin was \"meh\" as well. They should serve a better quality of English muffin.  Also, they don't leave the jams/jellies on the table, so you will have to request it.  

On the \"plus side\", our service was pretty good, I thought the portion size was ok, 
and we did not have a long wait to be seated.  Another plus is that they do not charge an upcharge if you want your omelet made from egg whites (many other places do charge extra for that).

I would consider giving this place another try if I had a great coupon or some other incentive. But quite honestly, I would be more inclined to go to Le Peep or Brigs before coming back here..."}
{"text":"Yum yummy! This place was delicious. Friendly staff, quick service, and good food. I enjoyed my breakfast. I really liked the grits. It's someplace I would go back to if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"The first time we went to this place it was really good. I remember giving it a 5-star review, but now coming back for the second time, it was very disappointing. Wait staff is always friendly and accommodating, but the food is mediocre. Poached eggs came underdone, the scrambled eggs were watery with a weird grayish tint and tasted horrible. I paid 37$ for 2 people and will not be returning. Feel ripped off."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place.  There is always a wait on weekends, but they are on the app NoWait though, so that helps.  My favorite is the cinnamon roll French toast.  It's literally a cinnamon roll that has been sliced & made into French toast that has cream cheese icing on it. It is served with strawberries, blueberries & raspberries on top.  There are 3 mounds of whipped cream on the plate as well.  Two eggs cooked however you like, as well as choice of meat come on a separate plate.  This breakfast was $13.49.  I ordered the bacon, which was very good.  Service was good.  One thing that stood out to me was how slow the busboys were.  I have never seen any move slower.  They left food on the chairs & floor also."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this chain in Jackson, MS and  had a very positive experience.  Today we decided to visit for brunch. It was busy but that was ok. We made it very clear to our sever that three of us had to eat gluten free she was not knowledgeable nor did she understand how important it was. Even though GF items were ordered I still got sick.  We sat for an hour before getting our food and glasses sat empty. Then when we received our food it was under cooked.  Not sure if this was a one time occurrence or a regular situation. We can't go back because we can't afford to get sick. Hopefully if you go you will have a completely different experience."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the breakfast options.  Just had The Lucy with green chilis and avocados.  Home made corned beef hash and fresh tomato salsa.  Wonder why their hash browns are standard frozen cubes that they deep fry?  Wish they were fresh.  Always friendly service too."}
{"text":"Great brunch!! Ate here after running a 10 mile race in Charlotte! They make a very good mimosa! My friend enjoyed his bloody mary. I got the lakeshore scramble, which was amazing! The hashbrown potatoes that come as a side were browned and crispy. :) It was a lot of food for the price you pay! I would definitely recommend eating breakfast here!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at one other location in New Orleans so we wanted to try this one out. The service was great. Our waitress was attentive and we were seated quickly. The bathrooms were clean too. We ordered the beignets with coffee as a breakfast appetizer. The Honduran coffee was amazing. But the beignets are nothing like the authentic NOLA ones, but still good. Our food was delicious but the breakfast skillet has a smaller portion than before. We had one small issue with our biscuit and gravy being cold but they fixed it professionally and quickly. All in all, it's a great breakfast but a couple little improvements to our experience would've given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food was so good I forgot to take the picture before I dug in! This place has multiple locations in the US but maintained that home feel! Each item on the menu is unique and designed for all kinds of preferences vegan and meat lover combined! I had the Baquezo Omelet with City Grits and it was FANTASTIC. the grits were so creamy and and the chorizo in my omelet had a nice subtle kick. My Mom had the Southern Crabstack and she could not put her fork down. Excellent suggestions from our waitress."}
{"text":"I've been to Broken Egg Cafe twice now, and I've got to say, I'm a fan.  

First, I've never had bad or poor service.  Sometimes it can be a little slow depending on when you go, but otherwise, the service is above reproach.  

Second, the food is pretty good, but not great just yet.  Perhaps I need to try a few more items on their menu...So far I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've had to eat at BEC.  I've had the Stan's #1 omelet.  It comes with crawfish, shrimp, mushrooms, ham & Cheddar-Jack cheese.  Not bad right?  Though it tasted great, the shrimp were a bit soggy and tasted as it they were maybe frozen?  With that being said, everything else was great.  My English muffin was great.  The bacon, which I usually get a side of, has always been cooked perfectly - crispy but not burnt.  

Its worth a visit if you have never been here for breakfast and definitely worth keeping in the Breakfast rotation if you have already been."}
{"text":"My husband used to really enjoy going to Skillets, and we finally made it out to Another Broken Egg Cafe a few weekends ago.  I ordered an omelet that had chorizo and something else in it.  Whatever it was, it sounded delicious on the menu.  The omelet itself though, was not as delicious.  The chorizo was like a chili meat...not the breakfast sausage I was looking for.  I don't remember what my husband ordered, but I do remember he thought it was just okay.  In the end, we both decided that Terrace Cafe is SO much better for about the same price."}
{"text":"The wait for 2-3 people on Sunday afternoon was 20 minutes. There is a small area at the entrance where you can sit and wait for your table to be come available. To the left of the entrance is a small bar area. Parking was difficult due to condo parking that is shared with the retail location however, if are willing to walk there is a parking garage a few blocks away. 

Service was good for a busy Sunday afternoon. Food came out timely. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. We drove an hour to try this place and were not disappointed. I had the egg white omelet, so delicious full of flavor - I did switch out the goat cheese for jack though. The omelet came with a generous portion of fresh fruit (melons,grapes, berries) on the side. My groom had a basic breakfast of two eggs, baked bacon, hash browns and English muffins. His eggs were over easy and perfectly cooked with a runny yolk. 
Service was great, very attentive no wait at 8:30 Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The beignets were delicious. They made my custom omelette just right. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend by locals and was not dissapointed at all. Everything was great and fast for our party of 7. Wish we had a few in the Hampton Roads area."}
{"text":"Our experience today was wonderful! It was crowded and there was a lengthy wait but that did not surprise us. Eventually we were seated and our service was excellent. Each staff member was friendly and attentive. We received numerous apologies and thanks for our patience over the wait time. Clearly this is a popular place with the locals. It didn't take long for us to discover why. The menu options were all so tempting and surprising. Amidst some traditional breakfast offerings, there were also many others with shrimp, crawfish and andouille sausage. They have amazing homemade sausage patties that are so full of flavor and deliciousness- truly never tasted a sausage patty so yummy. Actually, I hate sausage patties normally. We ordered an appetizer with fried green tomatoes and crab served on a bed of fresh spinach with feta cheese and a spicy remoulade sauce. Absolutely wonderful and interesting flavor combinations! I settled on blueberry pancakes, eggs and crispy bacon. It was all super fresh, high quality ingredients. The pancakes were the lightest and fluffiest ever! Hubby enjoyed a Mardi Gras omelet with crawfish and shrimp, homemade potatoes and an English muffin. Indeed everything was scrumptious, including the coffee. No doubt we will return to explore more offerings!"}
{"text":"Loved this place ! A little pricey but the menu variety and food were the difference! The atmosphere and unique table settings add to the experience - but mainly the food- all of it was wonderful ! Great place to enjoy breakfast or lunch ! Not your average eggs & bacon joint ... Lots of wonderful unique dishes ! And by the way - their dishes were all too cute ! Loved the coffee cups ! Don't miss this place ! Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"Service was great place was packed food sucked I had grilled chicken sandwich with potatoes they didn't have s vegan section so I had no choice but tipped the waiter cause she was nice but won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Wasn't a fan that the waiter added more of a tip on my card then I gave him, by like $15. When I talked to the manager she asked if \"I had issues with the service because the tip I gave was low\". First of all, it doesn't matter what the reason is why I left the tip I did, if you take more money then you allowed its call theft. Second, yes a matter of fact it was crappy service."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and got the Black Bean Cake Benedict.  It was so-so.  The chipotle hollandaise was way too spicy and hard to stomach.  However, the potatoes were great and the staff was very friendly.  I would come back here again but next time I would get an omelette."}
{"text":"Just hoping the food is better than the service here. 40 minute wait for a table which I didn't mind since it's a Sunday morning. Sat down and it took 15 minutes for our server to come over to take our drink order (coke and water). 20 minutes later and no drinks....waitress finally shows up and says sry I forgot about your drinks and puts two coffees down...politely tell her our correct drink orders and another 10 minutes go by before we get them. 

I've worked in restaurants for years so usually I'm considerate of factors that influence service. But 45 minutes to wait for water is a bit excessive. Not sure if it's worth waiting for the food at this point honestly. 

Update** finally got our food and it was as disappointing as the service. Both of us got the eggs Benedict with steak and crab. Waitress brought the food out and clearly didn't know how to carry plates because she had one pretty much balanced on the other. Result being my food was squished and the other plate got food all over the bottom which smeared all over the table when it was put down. The food itself looked ok but ended up stone cold, steak was chewy, and the crab tasted fishy. The only upside was that the manager comped the meal, but overall a complete waste of time and money. Plus I'm still hungry!"}
{"text":"I visited Another Broken Egg for the first time today for brunch with colleagues. It was packed when we arrived around 10:30 on a Saturday, but the wait wasn't too long. We ordered some beignets to share and they were delicious! I had the Southwest Scrambler, an omelette with breakfast chorizo, onions tomatoes and green chilis all topped with cheddar jack cheese. It also came with sides of salsa, guacamole and tortillas.  It was so yummy! I had the country potatoes for my side, which were ok. Next time I would try the city grits my colleague ordered....they looked wonderful. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great place breakfast!! Gourmet eggs and other dishes are wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant one every 2 weeks to try all the different menu items"}
{"text":"1. We were told 20-30 wait and waited 45 for a table while looking and seeing open tables not being used
2. We waited 15 minutes to have someone as us what we wanted to drink
3. We waited 1 actual hour before food was brought out...

The food here is great (cool coffee cups too) but this location is managed horribly and the service is awful. Go anywhere else, literally anywhere."}
{"text":"A-Okay.

Great offerings to use their space: private room, an intimate outdoor patio, plentiful tables and booths on the inside, and even a small bar. 

Tucked away and easy to miss in the Morrison Shopping Center. This location has had its share of various businesses over the past 4 years from entertainment center to Bank of Granite (I think), maybe something else, and now this restaurant. 

Friendly and attentive service. Food is average. Ordered the veggie burger made with black beans with a side of house fries (squared potatoes with seasoned salt). Fine, but not delicious. Friend ordered the BLT. Both of us enjoyed the quite diner-like experience, but noted that it isn't a place that we'd likely pick for a frequent lunch spot. 

Well decorated in perfect Southern flair, reminds me a bit like the Flying Biscuit. Needless to say, it made for a quiet lunch and service was great. Food, on the other hand, doesn't make my mouth water."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered appetizers that never came, delivered drinks with no straws,(we went and got our own) no silverware... Food took forever, when it finally arrived it was wrong, and we still had no silverware. Server ended up crying at our table, manager made her apologize, still crying, and it was absolutely mortifying. Never again. Another broken egg has a great concept but it's horribly managed and executed. It's an absolute shame."}
{"text":"The worst service, food and experience I have had in quite sometime. From the moment I walked in the door, the personnel felt like it was more important to chat with the regulars than to wait on me. It wasn't like they were busy at lunchtime. It was like I was an afterthought to this young lady's shift. The food (burger) had brown guacamole on it. They tried to hide it between the lettuce and the jalapeños. The coffee and refills were hard to get and not that great once I got them. A $13 lunch should be better in just about every aspect. First and last time going to this place."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from New York and a friend referred us here. So glad we came here! Great atmosphere, amazing staff and service, delicious food! We were in town househunting and will hopefully make this one of our regular breakfast spots when we move!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch around 12....expect a wait it was about 45 minutes! The frustrating thing about the wait was they had tons of empty tables so I think they just need to better manage their staff or maybe they were short staffed that day? We finally sat down and ordered a strawberry lemonade vodka drink which was yummy but pricey ($7) and of course being born in louisiana had to get beignets! The beignets were good and served with a fruit jelly of some sort (they didn't say). I ordered the lobster brie omelet which came with potatoes or grits and an English muffin. I got potatoes which were perfectly crispy and so good! The omelet had cream cheese inside and lobster and brie on top...it was amazing! I would go back and have a hard time not ordering this again even though so many other things look good!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, Memorial Day, my husband and I were up early. We wanted breakfast since we had the day off. Well, it's not easy to find a place open early for breakfast on a Monday. I first thought of Cafe Monte. Closed. The Original Pancake House down in Southpark is open, but then my husband reminded me of Another Broken Egg. Sold!
 I really like this place. I find it to be consistent which is a big plus. Parking can be challenging on the weekend but it wasn't yesterday. It's over in the same center as the Earthfare. 
Right now, when you check in on Yelp, you also get a free half order of their biscuit beignets which are really the best, especially dipped in the orange marmalade they serve alongside them. Must get these! 
They got your standard 'build your own breakfast'  sort of things like eggs, toast, potatoes, etc. Then many Omelettes to choose from as well as sweet options like sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon syrup. Make sure to ask for the REAL syrup because they have it. 
I think it's open everyday and early. Just know there will be a wait during the weekend breakfast hours. 
Check out their cool, custom made mugs when you are there enjoying your coffee or tea!"}
{"text":"Having just moved here from NJ we were looking for a great breakfast place like most of the diners in the North. We decided to try the Broken Egg Café. We walked in, were promptly seated and ordered coffee. Only then did we look at the menu. What a disappointment. Overpriced fancy shmancy dishes mostly slathered in cheese. Basic eggs, hashbrowns and toast were not to be seen. That's a meal that would be under $5.00 at a good diner up North. We decided we would not eat there and just pay for the coffee. When the bill came it was just shy of $6.00 for two cups of coffee (and not very good coffee). We payed it and left vowing never to return. Sadly, I can't speak to the quality of the food as we never got that far. There must be a good greasy spoon somewhere down here. We'll keep looking."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted some breakfast and felt like going somewhere other than Waffle House or Ihop.

My server was really nice, and actually started a conversation with me; probably since I was alone at the bar.

I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette which had breakfast chorizo, avocado, and cheddar cheese. It was served with sour cream and salsa on the side, and also an english muffin. I had the choice of potatoes or grits.

Honestly, I had a higher expectation for the food but it was still good.The only issue I had which is unorthodox was the speed that my food came out. Yes, it was warm but it was just a flag to me."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch! Their food has always been delicious. The wait time can be a little long but I feel that it is worth it. I was excited about the drink options for brunch time but wasn't impressed with the drink itself. I believe it was a Peach Sangria of some sort. Way too sweet and had no ice or fruit. But like I mentioned before, the food has always been great and the staff is pretty nice."}
{"text":"Bleh... in almost every way.... bleh.

I never went to the Skillets that was here previously, so I can't compare it to that.  But I have eaten breakfast before, so I based my expectations on that.  If you are anticipating IHOP or Cracker Barrel portions, food or prices, this ain't your jam.  I don't think it was overpriced necessarily for the selection and options, but I do think it was overpriced for the quality and taste.  

The young lady that seated me was very pleasant, and another woman that was walking around checking on people was nice as well.  My waiter was a little zzzz but competent, though my water was never refilled and once the food hit the table I didn't see him again.

The food:
The Traditional with corned beef hash ($9) - from their menu this is 2 eggs any style, an english muffin and seasoned potatoes.  My 2 eggs were indeed over-well but were nothing special and seemed small, the english muffin was somehow hard and chewy at the same time and tasted odd, and the only seasoning on the potatoes was salt.  The \"butter\" that I put on my english muffin tasted off.  The potatoes seemed to be the standard frozen style small cut potatoes, but were well done, though overly salty.  The corned beef hash was horrible - I love corned beef, like LOVE it, I'll even eat the canned corned beef hash on occasion when I need the salty beefy potatoey stuff, but this was not good - not at all.  The meat was pulverized, but grainy (?), and mixed in the mash was tiny cut green and red peppers, onions, and I was told potatoes as well, but I didn't taste that at all.  It was fried crispy like I like, but after two bites I wasn't going to punish myself anymore.  Yuck.

Side of a sausage gravy biscuit ($3.49) - Relatively good, but I make better.  Biscuit held up well to the gravy, the 3 pieces of sausage were good.  Well seasoned.  

The total (I had water to drink) was a little over $13 and absolutely not worth it.  The best part of the meal was the crushed ice in the water (I love crushed ice).  I could make everything I had better at home or jump on 485 and head to either Cracker Barrel or IHOP for better food.  

\"I ain't goin' back.\" - Pawpaw C."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on this review. I really wanted to like ABE and had high hopes when entering the building for a memorable breakfast. 

Instead I stood by the \"Please Wait, We will seat you!\" sign for 5 minutes prior to anyone approaching us. The person who finally spoke to us was a server who then went to clean a dirty table to seat us even though 95% of the restaurant was empty and clean. My group of 4 sat down and placed our drink order with our server. He brings me my coffee in a styrofoam to go cup and tells me that they are out of clean coffee cups. When the restaurant almost empty I doubt that was the case. 

I ordered the Sausage and Gravy biscuits. The gravy was delicious and the portion was pretty large. The sausage patties were strange, very sweet and off putting flavor. Another guest at the table had a burger and they cooked it to order which gave them brownie points in my book! 

Overall I was disappointed but will probably try again. Maybe they just had an off day! Everyone deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"I guess my expectations were just too high. First off, the first thing that popped out at us were the prices. Normally I don't squawk IF the quality and portions justify it. In this case, they did NOT. 

I'm keeping this review simple. The food came out COLD. Portions were VERY SMALL. I ordered their signature Lobster Omlette and the Lobster was NOT very fresh....a little \"fishy.\" At most these were 2 medium egg omlettes. There was supposed to be a \"Champagne Butter Sauce\" on top. I didn't detect it. There was supposed to be Cream Cheese in the middle. Nada. The Cinnamon roll to start was just OK to me. My friends liked it more than I did. Quite frankly Cinnabon is MUCH better. Sorry it is!

The Good : Coffee was excellent. Our server Iris was super friendly and attentive. Location is close to my house.

The Bad: High prices, cold food, average quality and SMALL portions.

I do not believe I will come back. There are way too many breakfast places that are much cheaper and far better. I've had much better breakfasts at IHOP and a few other places in town to justify coming back here."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 9 days after posting my original review, the restaurant is permanently closed. Can't say I will lose any sleep over it."}
{"text":"I give them two stars at most and will not be back. The first time I went was in September. I went to eat lunch by myself. I waited for my food for over 30 minutes. Once the food came I got up to use the restroom since I had already drank a gallon of water while waiting for my food. When I came back my table had been cleared. Understandable I guess! The waitress gave me a free entree coupon for next time. The food was ok that day, wish I got to eat the entire portion or was refunded, but whatever. Today I called in a pick up order. They told me it would be ready in 12 minutes. I get there in 15 minutes and she said the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 10 minutes. Aggravating. Someone else was waiting as well and having the same issue. I ended up waiting 20 MINUTES!!!!!! As I waited I saw several patrons getting up to find employees to ask for water refills and such. When my food finally came I asked if I could have some
Ketchup. She very sarcastically told me she personally already put it in the bag. Got back to work and Of course no ketchup in my bag. Food was very greasy. I am so done with this place! Never again!"}
{"text":"I used to work downtown and now work in the South Park area.  There are a couple cafes in the area but none that are really memorable. ABE I found by accident doing a Google search. I absolutely love this place. The breakfast is priced just right and  tastes homemade. The bacon is crispy, their scrambled eggs taste extremely fresh and their potatoes are large and in charge. Zero complaints and have been back 3x this week."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and can write a review stating that the food is average but the service is terrible. Once I actually got cold eggs and another time they actually forgot us!"}
{"text":"Can tell it's my another favorite!!! I had the skinny omelette which was great :P randomly stop by here but will come back when I come to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We are liking Another Broken Egg.  A kitchy country kitchen motif serving lunch and breakfast.  And it is convenient to my father's assisted living digs and St. Matthew Church.

We like the menu.  Lots of suggestions and creative omelets.  And they will create what you like better or want modified on their menu.  Service is prompt and the food comes out hot and as described.

Endless coffee and iced tea makes for a good leisurely breakfast or lunch.

Given the fine location in Ballantyne, Sunday is a mob scene with the various church crowds coming in on schedule.  Waits will run up to 45 minutes, but you end up sitting with nice people to pass the time.

A nice place. Worth the weekend waits.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"A great place for sunday brunch. They have a great variety of options for breakfast and lunch. 

Veggie omelet - It was excellent and cooked perfectly. The goat cheese was evenly spread out. 

Hey Lucy - I got it without the meat and with egg whites instead and it was delicious. The avocados really added to the dish. I wish there was a little bit more salt and pepper in the omelet but that is a personal touch, nothing against the restaurant. 

Potatoes - The side of potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and well seasoned. Exactly how I like them.  

Mimosa- It came with a strawberry and that gave it nice touch. You could also taste the champagne so it was just all orange juice which was good. 

Overall, I would come back here. The food, drinks and service is great! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Smoked salmon and pouched eggs on a bagel with cream cheese and crêpes. Fantastic taste and great service!"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying this, I don't really do breakfast. 
Because of that, when my family does breakfast, it is a large group of people (15+) that descend upon a restaurant and cause havoc for everyone involved. 
With that being said, I found ABE a very nice break from the normal restaurant feel.  
Upon walking into the restaurant, you realize that there are several rooms spread about the interior, giving a smaller restaurant feel when you are seated. 
The menu is a little limited, however every one of the offerings we had were nicely prepared and seasoned properly.   The menu prices seemed a little on the steep side for breakfast, but as the food came out, I realized that the serving sizes were appropriate for the pricing.  
All in all, everyone was quite pleased with the food that they received, and was extremely happy with the staff that took care of us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast! I always go with my boyfriend or my friends and they all love it just as much as I do. My favorites are the Floridian omelet and the cinnamon roll French toast. The service is always great, it keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Saturday brunch. Great service, friendly staff. The food was delicious - southwest scramble and Louisiana omelet were a perfect start to the day!"}
{"text":"Before even sitting down this cafe is a terrible experience. Customers are walking in and leaving because the wait time is 30-35 minutes but when you look through the lobby there are tons of empty tables. I waited 30 minutes to sit at a table that was empty the entire time I was waiting in the lobby area. While the food maybe wonderful, service is a key part of any dinning experience , and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Okay I have to admit upfront that I was not overly excited about trying yet another unspectacular chain breakfast restaurant and did not have the highest of expectations walking in here mid-morning on a Tuesday. I did so thanks to a BOGO coupon.

I ordered the Salmon & Raw Kale Salad and it was surprisingly good. The ample serving of  salmon steak was both seasoned and cooked well. The light dressing over the kale was sweet and tangy however I did encounter a few pieces with brown spots. Avoiding such  is always a challenge with kale even at home.

My buddy ordered the Sausage Chorizo Omelet with hash browns. Despite being a bit dry it was acceptable and plentiful.

Service was fair as waitress seemed young and inexperienced. Atmosphere was relaxed and attractive. It did exceed my expectations but in this case that means it was just fair to good. Glad I tried it but probably won't be back simply because there are just too many better options."}
{"text":"Ecclectic Creative Breakfast Menu

First time we went to an Another Broken Egg Cafe was earlier this summer in Vinings Ga when we went down for our Grandson's birthday and baptism.  Enjoyed it and since we were down in the Ballentyne area, decided to give this one a try as well.

Biggest difference between the Vinings locaiton and this one is the level of energy.  Vinings appers to be smaller and more crowded so the servers have to be more fast paced.  This location is bit more spread out and the pace of the service is a bit slower but this would only be a problem if you were on a tight time budget.  That said, it's not slow service but rather, you don't feel quite as rushed.

My wife ordered a Veggie Burger with a side of Fruit. She like both and was particulary pleased that the side of fruit had more than just melons in it.  In Vinings, she had had an omelet that was called a Floridian which looked great so I tired that for breakfast. It's a stuffed omelet with Cream Cheese as one of the filling and it was indeed very good.

It's a good menu and the food is well prepared and excellent service.  Ballentyne is a bit of a hike from Cornelius, but next time we are in the area, we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. It's best to go around 9 AM on a Sunday. My friend had the Belgian waffle and it was a little bit spongy for our taste. I had the spinach omelette and it was great definitely would order again."}
{"text":"First try at Another Broken Egg. Probably last try. I came on a Monday morning at 10am. It was not packed but steady. Service was horrible. Not friendly and rushed feeling. I ordered Bellini to drink and watched as a woman, ON THE PHONE, tried to make it. She poured a few things in and dropped a frozen peach in, looked at my server and shrugged. Needless to say worth the $8.00 price tag. I am pretty sure the one who made it was the manager. 

I had the Lobster and Brie Omlette which was not bad. Not worth $15 but not awful. The grits, on the other hand, were great!.

Overall, I say skip this place and go to Toast or Flying Biscuit. You will have better service and better food."}
{"text":"I should've listened to what others were saying in the reviews. They were literally SPOT ON!  We came here being optimistic of a shorter line than other well known breakfast spots on the morning of New Years Day.  We were optimistic because we had just visited two other places that we knew had amazing food, but left due to 60+ min waits.  We then called Broken Egg and asked about a reservation over the phone but were told it wasn't offered. But they did promise us a 20 minute wait so we headed on over.  After arrival we waited for about 35 minutes outdoors after putting our names on the list...  And then we stepped inside, and despite asking about our promised seating time multiple times, we had to wait for an additional 20 minutes.  As another reviewer noted, we saw very slow turnaround of tables while waiting after customers left.  Tables were left dirty for a while before anyone came to clean or in some cases there were just empty tables and people just weren't being seated at them.  If it wasn't for having a party of 7, we would've definitely made it a point to request an empty table that we were looking at. Well at long last after being seated, you would hope the food was worth it.  In our case, it sadly was not  I wanted to like the food, but the cinnamon bun pancakes I ordered just weren't good.  The way everything was thrown together somehow kept the flavors from working as the menu would have you think it would. My homefries were great however, there's no denything that. Another sore, spot was that my wife's food (waffle sliders) was served cold to the touch.  Like refridgerator cold.  It was sad because you could imagine how hungry we were after the wait.  Instead of asking them to heat the food back up, she simply asked for some warm syrup. The waitress said ok, and then left never to be seen again. We asked a different waitress we caught walking by and asked her for the same thing.  She said yes and also was not seen for at least 10 minutes.  When she did come back, it was without the syrup. Very frustrating.  My wife ended up pickng over her cold food but we chose to get something else to eat after leaving.  I would not recommend coming here to anyone curious.  Not only was the customer service among some of the worse I've experienced, but the food was not worth it even if there was no wait.  There are much better options close by"}
{"text":"The rustic, country feel when we walked in was immediate.  We were met by a cherub faced young man who's pleasant southern charm radiated through. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait and it was only 20.  
Our server Amber welcomed us right away with a huge smile and suggestions for beverages. We ordered coffees and grapefruit juice.  I found the coffee a bit bitter and the juice was not fresh squeezed  (probably out of a soda gun). Amber recommended the Benyets (sp?) Fried donuts with powered sugar and marmalade for dipping...delish!
Our breakfast was Banana Foster waffles (crispy with a wonderful sauce and homemade whip cream) and Corn beef hash with 2 eggs and roasted veggies which was outstanding! 
The service was fantastic and the food was excellent we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and bright environment. Happy workers. Service was great. Full belly. Great place to try if you haven't already. Cost is 10-15 per person. Good amount of food for price. Our new fav breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"45 minute wait on a friday morning for a $36 breakfast that was mediocre at best...Nah...not my cup of tea ."}
{"text":"One of the BEST brunch spots in Charlotte! They're known for their omelettes, so you can't go wrong with one of those. Get the potatoes as a side; they're scrumptious. Also, the pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Had the sampler breakfast with eggs, Turkey sausage and an English muffin. Service was ok. The real complaint I had was that there were a bunch of flies that were uber annoying. I tried to mentally block out the fact that at least twice there were flies in my food. Please take care of the flies because for many this is a complete and 100% deal breaker."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I'm so excited to find a new favorite breakfast spot.  They had a huge menu - it was hard to decide on what to get!  I settled on the veggie omelet (which had goat cheese - yum) and was amazing.  I look forward to going back and trying some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning and was seated immediately. I had the super omelette with potatoes and grits. Everything was great, well seasoned. The grits were nice and creamy. My date had the crab cakes and fried tomatoes, my food was so good that I forgot to ask her how the crab cakes were. The fried green tomatoes were so sweet and the breeding was perfect. We received good portions of everything."}
{"text":"Waiting 20 minutes to even order drinks and another hour and ten minutes until food arrived--no surprise the server had put in the order incorrectly and had to wait for food to be prepared again. By this time we had been at the restaurant for an hour and a half, my friend had already finished her mediocre-at-best breakfast burrito, and I had not received any food at all. We had somewhere to be as we never expected breakfast to take this long, and had to ask to get my food to go. No offer to make amends for the multiple errors and long wait, and to top it all off even after we stated we were in a hurry she walked right passed us when we had cards ready to pay for the food and took ANOTHER 15 minutes with the check. Have never experienced service quite this poor before. Run from this place!"}
{"text":"By far, the best brunch I have ever had! It was so hard to choose what to eat. I had the lobster and brie omlette and added a banana foster pancake. I couldnt eat it all but couldn't eat it all either. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the wait time is just too long. If you plan to have brunch on a Sunday, prepare to wait. That's disappointing! I had the crabstack and others had the pancakes and French toast and everything was 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I visited this location last Wednesday and was delightfully surprised!  This is an attractive, well run restaurant with great ambience and a great selection of delicious food.  I had the Waffle with Bananas Foster...I make yeast waffles at home and this rivalled mine...the Bananas Foster topping made it scrumptious!  Great coffee, too.  My friend had the skinny omelet, which I didn't order because so often egg white omelets are tasteless.  This omelet looked & tasted delicious...filled with asparagus, goat cheese, baked whole cloves of garlic.  This omelet was accompanied by a generous fruit bowl and an English muffin.  We were able to converse easily and privately.  Our waitress, Eloisa, was attentive but not intrusive.  The manager/owner, Veronica, stopped by to make sure we were satisfied and we sang our praises!  I'm a good cook and baker and am fairly fussy about eating out...this will be my brunch go to from now on.
I can't believe the negative reviews!!  We loved it!!!
Thank you!
Eileen J."}
{"text":"$13 for eggs Benedict. Lol. $4 for a side pancake.  Listen, I'll spend money on food but lol.  This is breakfast. Peace and love and good luck!"}
{"text":"Since this restaurant has limited hours, getting a table has to be strategic so you're not waiting an hour for a table.  The after church crowd rushes in around 10:30am on sundays, so be cautious of that. Staff is super friendly and helpful, they don't rush you out even though there's a ton of people waiting to be seated. The food is delicious and filling. I actually don't like stand alone egg dishes where you see a the yolk, whites or scrambled together, but I heard great things so I wanted to try. It was VERY limited if you are looking for something besides egg. Had the Sweet Potato Pancake. The spiced pecans had too much spice, nutmeg maybe? Made it unappetizing. Can't really taste the sweet potato either, and pricy for one layer of pancake!  The Biscuit Beignets, however, were so delish. Split those things in half and spread the warm marm on top and you're in heaven. I'd go back only for the beignets.  Unless I turn into an egg eater."}
{"text":"We finished a tax review meeting with our accountant working up an appetite for some comfort food to take the sting out of our tax due. Arriving at Another Broken Egg Cafe, we were greeted by our pleasant and bubbly server, Eloisa. The food was amazing! I enjoyed waffles topped with pecans, slices of fresh Brie cheese, and Raspberry Crisps (made with fresh raspberries and granola.) Served on the side were 2 perfectly poached eggs (medium soft yolks) served with extra crispy bacon strips (very crispy, to my delight and per my request.) My only criticism was that the maple syrup was watery (probably due to warming.) Eloisa quickly met my request to replace it with a lovely, thick honey to drizzle over the amazing waffle creation.  What a fabulous salty/sweet treat!
Green tea accompanied it all, and was tasty and served in a lovely ceramic mug. A manager even came by to confirm our satisfaction. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch. Our 1st time here. Almost empty. My wife just had gum surgery so we tried a place where we could order \"soft\" food. Her pancakes were very good, large and flavorful. My chicken salad was so so. Didn't care for the flavor. One note of caution: soft drinks are pricey-&2.69 is pretty steep."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My favorite breakfast spot.  I had to make an agreement with myself to only go when I have friends or family visiting from out of town because the beignets at so delicious.  Actually everything I have tried is delicious!  All of the Benedicts are tasty, however if you are a Benedict snob you may not appreciate that the poached eggs are usually overdone, not sure if it's deliberate but I don't mind.  The shrimp and grits weren't my favorite and I was a bit disappointed considering how often I have heard people raving over them but perhaps as a newyorker in the south I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I love the mugs in which they serve the hot beverages.  They are super cute!  The restaurant looks like your average diner but the food is anything but.  I know for sure if for nothing else, I will be back for those beignets :-)"}
{"text":"Better than a diner!  This is one of our favorite breakfast/brunch places.  We sit at the bar almost always... The service is quick but thorough.  I love that they have healthy options like the delicious blueberry quinoa bowl and guilty pleasures like corned beef hash and grits topped with bacon and perfectly brown hash browns and gluten free options too if that's your jam.  An equal opportunist eater like me can appreciate this.  You must try the beignets at least once!  Yum... The orange and honey marmalade they serve them with isn't for everyone but it's tasty all the same.  I love that they have wifi that actually works so when I need a change of scenery to get some work done.  Be warned that it does get crowded during prime brunch times but the bar is always an option and hey, they serve coffee while you wait .  Last mention is they serve alcohol... Never a bad thing right?!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place. Seen the long line when it opened up and gave some time for the crowds to slow down, and bugs to be worked out. I went in yesterday for lunch with higher than average expectations, just to be pretty dissapointed. Food was average at best. I'll take IHOP over this place any time. Skillets was much better. I ordered from the breakfast menu, two eggs over easy, home fries, toast and sausage patties. Average crowd for lunch. No wait. Place was half empty, so there should be no excuse for making mistakes. Sausage patties were two average tasting, squashed down, meatballs. One of the eggs came out broken and yolk fried hard. Instead of toast, I got english muffin. way too many mistakes on one plate and not so busy lunch. No quality control. No chef or food expediter should have ever let plate like that leave the kitchen. A form of a redemption came in the form of bringing out additional toast and giving me 50% off.
All in all, with all the competition and choices around Ballantyne, if its up to me making a decision, I am not going back there."}
{"text":"Long wait but great eats!!! This place knows how to do breakfast. French toast is delicious. Breakfast meats are great also!!!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit for brunch and once again . . . Y-U-M!!!  The first time I got the crabcake benedict and bloody mary.  Both were delicious!  I took half of my food home with me so I got 2 meals out of it!  

This second time I got the black bean benedict and again, I was impressed!  the tomato hollandaise sauce was great!  I enjoyed the smoky flavor of the dish with the black bean cake, poached egg and sauce!  I can't wait to go back and try something else!  

My husband and friend both got the Hey Lucy omelet and loved it!  They give you so much food so it's well worth the money!!"}
{"text":"First impression was good. Smoked salmon Benedict was a cool concept over all decent taste but salmon alone was disappointing. If your going to serve salmon it has to be good quality. 
We dined outside and enjoyed mimosas. Good atmosphere. It's good, it's not toast good though."}
{"text":"We drove around looking for something new to try for breakfast, and happened upon here. It was a Saturday morning, and we had to wait about 30 min. for a table. Our server was very attentive and friendly, although a bit forgetful in getting a couple of extras. We tried the beignets, and, as others have mentioned, they really weren't that good. They were hard and tasted slightly burnt. The Eggs Benedict were good, nothing special. The Southwest Scrambler (with soft tortillas) was pretty delicious, and the salsa was a standout. The home fried potatoes were good. We got a Mother's Day coupon so we may go back one more time as we want to try the Huevos Rancheros with the salsa. Side note: we asked if they had tomato juice (most places do not), and they offered V8. Upon arrival, the server told us we got the last 2 glasses as it was being discontinued."}
{"text":"Pricy. Sub par food. Pancakes taste like flour. Tough. Potatoes cold and over cooked. Very slow service. Sunny side eggs scorched and lacy. However waitress was good."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch the day after Xmas, it was pretty busy but didn't have to wait too long. Got the black bean eggs Benedict with the chipotle hollandaise and, besides the poached eggs being underdone, the flavors were pretty good. Noticed the appearance of the potatoes on other tables walking in, so opted to substitute grits instead, and was so glad I did. We also ordered some of the biscuit beignets to share at the table, and they were pretty disappointing, the dough was extremely dense and heavy, and I couldn't get past the first one I ate. Also took a star off for the service. I'm not a fan of waiting by committee, and it lead to a lot of confusion, as we were left waiting for condiments, side orders, and drinks a little too long. For the prices they charge for a breakfast, I'd expect service to be a lot more on point."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, family friendly, clean, and all around happy feeling.

Besides the poached eggs being REALLY runny, everything was great.

Props for the pickled okra on the Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience!!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast / brunch. Nicole was our server and she was the sweetest! She made great suggestions, told us all about the menu & went above and beyond to let us sample a couple things prior to ordering. My husband ordered Carnitas eggs Benedict which was on a jalapeños cornbread, city grits which had green onion, bacon & tomato in them. I got French toast, scrambled eggs, sausage patties & grits with cheese. The sausage has rosemary & hot sauce in it and is to die for! This is our new favorite brunch spot & we cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really great brunch spot - they have a spicy Bloody Mary and delicious Eggs Benedict! What more do you need?"}
{"text":"My bf and I make it a point to find different breakfast locations that offer more than your typical bacon, eggs and toast menu. I stumbled upon this place via instagram. I was very impressed with the food! The biscuits beignets are a must! Their eggs were fluffy and their bacon was crisp! I tried their chobani tuile which was very light and refreshing. The service could have been better but it was a holiday weekend and you could tell they were a bit understaffed. Completely understandable due to the holiday -  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their food was so good we're coming back this weekend!  I had the (and I can't remember the exact name) lobster egg omelet with potatoes.  Everything was on point.  My boyfriend got the Cinnabon French toast which was excellent as well.  The andouille sausage that came with it was so good.  I want to try the shrimp and grits next since it has the andouille sausage and I think it's cheesy grits too.  They have a good variety of entrees on their menu which means we'll be coming back more to try the different items!"}
{"text":"Hostess has a terrible attitude. We were asked to wait 15 mins for our table. The table they ended up sitting us at was empty when we arrived and already bussed. Many open tables throughout the restaurant. Everyone was asked to wait while she disappeared to the back for the majority of the 15 mins. She was awful at identifying who she was actually seating. Everyone was confused. When we ordered I asked for an OJ and a latte. Still have not received the OJ and we've been sitting here for about 15 mins. The item I ordered off their \"Holiday Menu\" they are out of. Nothing irritates me more than to have a specials menu and be out of those items. The person I'm with ordered a hot tea and got half a small cup of hot water. The entire serving staff has the same attitude of the hostess. WE WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.

I just asked for ketchup and got 3 straws instead. There are 2 of us ... ???"}
{"text":"Get the cinnamon roll french toast with mixed berries!! AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Went in today for breakfast, sat at the counter, and had the Oscar Benedict. The food was good but wasn't worth the $14. I think the price was because of the ingredients (crabmeat, asparagus, and steak) but not of the quantity or quality. 

My real issue was the server at the counter. Not my assigned server, but the stringy haired brunette with the Santa Claus cap who's hair was not tied back and she ate at the counter, during her shift, in front of patrons and didn't wash her hands after. And she ate with her fingers and kept waving her hair back and forth. Girl, you ain't Beyonce or Becky. Yeah...

I considered saying something but I was with company and so I'm here sharing with you Yelp family.  I won't go back here and I'm disappointed that she was allowed to be so poorly behaved on the floor."}
{"text":"Really like the variety in the menu at this place. Plenty of seating and the waiter kept my coffee cup full and checked in enough to be helpful and not annoying.  I had the Lobster & Brie omelet and it was cooked firm, the brie nicely melted and the lobster in chunks big enough to get good flavor. 

I'll be adding this place to my breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"My dining mate and I had breakfast here and we were not disappointed.
 The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch features a wonderful assortment of dishes from specialty pancakes , waffles,  a variety of egg dishes,  breakfast cereals and yogurts,  and sides such as biscuits, grits, country potatoes, and a variety of sausages etc.
 Brunch features burgers and salads and other brunch specialties such as crab cakes, chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and specialty omelettes etc.
Menu prices moderate, good portions, food plated nicely came out hot.
Our breakfast bill for 2,  was around $35.
Our waiter was friendly and accommodating and offered to suggest customer favorites. The atmosphere comfortable.
We both ordered the smoked salmon benedict on a bagel which was delicious. The coffee was great but pricey.
 As a matter of fact the coffee cups were made in the US and were on sale for about $19 a coffee cup and $25 for a cappuccino cup.
We would certainly return  agian and try another menu choice for a special breakfast.
A kids menu is also available.
I read other reviews but ours was very positive with our visit."}
{"text":"Let me start with a positive. The wait staff were attentive. Now let's go to the negative... the food. It was pedestrian. The pancakes were chewy, the oatmeal had a glob of berry compote rather than fresh berries, the potatoes and biscuits were cold. I was hoping this would be better than your average chain but I was wrong. I had been before during the week and it was much much better Perhaps Saturday is not a day to go."}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time. It was great, I don't know I f it was because I was so hungry or it really was delicious. I had the \"hey Suzy\" it was great."}
{"text":"We came back to use our gift card they gave us due to the horrific experience we had the first time we went. So this time was much better until the very end. Service was excellent,  food was hot and delicious we asking for the check and that's where it began. We gave the the business card and out debit card from the manager that read $25/off. The check came back and it was incorrect she only took off $8.00 we asked her about it and she said she read it wrong let me fix it. well after 21 minutes later she came back and said the computers are all messed up its all on us. which was nice but 21 minutes later a little ridiculous.  so we needed change for a $10 to tip her we asked the hostess stand and the guy went to two waitresses to ask for change and both said they cant give up their $5's and $1's.  we just left. customer service is severely needed at this restaurant when things start to go bad."}
{"text":"Compared to another local breakfast restaurant (Toast), this one has much better service.  The wait staff was efficient in getting us seated, providing refills on beverages, and checking back to make certain everything was okay.  The food, however, was not quite as good as what I found at TOAST.  I ordered the vegetable omelet and was underwhelmed by how thin and sparse it was.  It was covered in goat cheese, which I am sure that I must have missed on the menu -  since I am not a fan of goat cheese.   The English Muffin was better than the little piece of toast at TOAST.  The grits were a tie!   Bright atmosphere and definitely family friendly as there was a noisy baby near our table.    Overall, less expensive than TOAST and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Below average food. The French toast was simply wheat bread toasted and dry. It was just plain bread, I dk how else to explain it. We were guilt tripped for asking straws. Apparently we are destroying the planet for requesting a straw. Club music was blaring for the entire time we were there. Our biscuits were hockey pucks. I dk what all the hype is about. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good brunch!!!   Perfect size helping!!  Get ready for a bit of a wait, but I assume mainly because the food is that good!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. The eggs Benedict didn't have a proper hollandaise sauce - it was more of a cream. And don't get me started on the water they serve. It literally comes out of the kitchen's sink and has strong notes of chlorine, fluoride, copper, and other minerals characteristic of bad tap water. I couldn't even mask the foul taste with a lemon. 

Owners, if you're reading this, please, we're all begging you, invest a small amount of money in a water filter. It makes a huge difference in the taste of the water - and it is healthier for you, too."}
{"text":"This cute breakfast cafe has some of the unusual breakfast plates of anyplace you will ever find. Food is excellent and service was acceptable. One problem is for brunch on a Sunday you have to wait till noon to buy a Bloody Mary or any other brunch liquor drink. The prices are a few dollars more than most other breakfast cafes, but for the experience it is worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I want to like this place; been here 3 times but the service is so slow. 
The girl asked me if I wanted fruit with my skillet and then she asked my husband if he wanted fruit with his pancakes.. he was so disappointed; there were some soggy raspberries on his pancakes that ruined the whole taste for him. We had to ask for more coffee cause none came on its own and then when we wanted to pay and our waitress couldn't be found, my husband went to pay and was told he couldn't pay and had to sit for the waitress.. what a waste of time."}
{"text":"Very excited to try this place as we had never been before. This location is huge and we had no wait for a table this Sunday morning. Our waitress was efficient and friendly. The food was excellent and no complaints at all. The biscuit beignets were out of this world served warm with homemade marmalade. It was the favorite part of our entire meal but not free so you have to pay for them (I would eat the whole plate myself if they were free).
Hubby went with the Floridian omelet that comes with breakfast potatoes. He had a side of Andouille sausage and was very pleased with his meal.
I went all out and had the Cinnamon roll French toast, which was delicious as well.
The hand glazed mugs they use for coffee are very cute and you can purchase them. My only complaint is that it was a very expensive breakfast with the sides we ordered, and not something we would do all of the time."}
{"text":"A dear friend and I had breakfast at Another Broken Egg Cafe this morning and could not have been more pleased! Rice was our server and was quick to answer questions, refill our iced tea, which was perfect by the way and offered overall, outstanding service! We both ordered The Floridian Omelet which included crabmeat and was AWESOME! The grits we ordered were excellent; best I've had in a long time. I look forward to going back! It would be a huge plus if the menu could provide more gluten free items AND if it was open at night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here for our breakfast date. Excellent choice for our first date in almost 2 years. I had the Crabcakes Cavallo and my husband had a traditional breakfast of pancakes, eggs and turkey sausage.  I enjoyed my crabcakes benedict but I wish it was a little spicier.  You can tell my husband enjoyed it by the animalistic noises. What I really is the friendly staff. The chef introduced himself and we had a great convo with Aaron, the manager. So we will be back ;)"}
{"text":"ABEC is usually good, but lately, with the restaurant being overcrowded, the quality of service AND WORKERS has gone all the way downhill. More than likely never to return to being good. This morning, as many Sunday mornings, I called in my order. Same as usual, Bacon, Egg & Cheese on toasted bread. The only thing I asked for in regards to the eggs, are Egg Whites. They can never get it right, So when I get  back home, I am sorely disappointed!!!!

So today, I arrive 10 minutes AFTER (late) the girl said the order would be ready. Since I know how they roll over there with counter service. I land at the front counter, and as always there is no host behind the counter because the place is PACKED with people standing inside and outside.
Usually my food is sitting there next to the computer, waiting for me. Not this time.
I did overhear that they are short staffed and people are always calling out.

OK, so now, there are workers all over the place and one guy comes behind the pick up counter to go to the  ordering computer/system. He looks at me and keeps it moving. Never once asking if I need anything. Never really recognizes that I am standing there looking stupid, for assistance, but he keeps it moving. The same with ALL the girls at the intake counter, right behind me. I mean if I am standing there looking like I need help, do they even offer any? NOPE!

I contemplated to myself, if I should just walk out & leave and let them eat the  food themselves and waste my order. Since there was no service to me.

So, after about 10 minutes of standing there looking stupid, I turn around and ask the girl (the same one that I have seen  all the time standing there, and she saw me looking stupid) if my order for pickup is ready. She asks my name. I mean come on!
She goes to talk to a woman who brings two bags from the back out. It wasn't that she thought I ordered the pancakes w. Syrup...no. It's that the fool who ordered pancakes are going to get home and realize they are probably ICE COLD!!! Oh yeah, that person wasn't there either! He/She probably tipped them  about $10.00 extra for the \"great\" service. LMAO!

Ok, so now on to the order itself. I mean it comes up to the same amount every time: $8.22. This time I opted NOT to give a tip on the receipt! And do you people notice that's the first thing they look at when you hand them back the signed receipt??? And I wonderfully walked out!

Ok, for the past few months, it's been the same kind of \"service\" at this place. And it all seems to be ok, judging by the clientele that comes in, they have no problem with being overlooked! NOT me!

So as usual when I get home and open the carton, the sandwich is warm. Decent.
Now, let's look at THE CONTENTS...The sandwich is cut diagonally. However, I notice this doesn't have egg whites. Just regular yellow eggs.
Usually the bacon is blackened to a crisp - literally burned. Not today. It's just overcooked and really crispy (almost burned) to the bite.
Now as upset as I am, I'm not going to make a scene, since I am home..lol.
I go to break apart the sandwich, but notice that the bread on both sides is positioned WRONG (upside down)! It's cut diagonally on the bottom ( top of bread facing right), but the top piece (top of bread facing left) , it's completely turned in the opposite direction. So, it doesn't match up. Which means they have stupid people working there!

Now I am hungry.  I just paid $8.22 and I am going to eat it.

I know a man made my food, because women are not disoriented like this. They are very precise and organized and orderly about things.
And can I tell you out of every restaurant I went to in this Ballantyne/Piper Glen area where men prepared something, I have been disappointed EVERY TIME! The men that work in these places have no skills in the kitchen out here (most recently Applebees across from my apt on Piper Station Dr.).  AND I AM A MAN!

I really need to return to cooking @ home. But I'm a single man who lives alone, with no nagging wife or spoiled kids. I expect the best when I order out.

I can't do this with this place anymore..I'm done! I will gladly continue to go to my lil Light-rail  Diner on Sharon Lakes Rd and South Blvd! That place gets it RIGHT EVER YTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never a disappointment!

Maybe because the workers are EXPERIENCED and older. These young people are a lost cause!

UGH!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks, place is clean and staff is very friendly. Best breakfast spot in Ballantyne. Have been here many times and never had an issue. If you're looking for a great spot to eat breakfast this is the place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the black stone Benedict, and added the any flavor 2.99 pancake deal! Unfortunately i never received the pancake, my sister order banana foster pancakes they gave her French toast, my cousin had the lemon blueberry goat cheese pancakes that weren't tasty at all. My waiter was good but he seemed a little stressed , i understood . But overall , when i come back in town, i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Extraordinary quality and great service. Bacon perfect, eggs perfect, English muffin perfect. My favorite, though, was the grits. Best I've ever had. Coffee was okay; a little strong for my tastes. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Way, way, way overpriced. Eggs were dry and potatoes not homemade. For 10+ $ for breakfast they need to step up food quality 1000%. Staff was very attentive though."}
{"text":"They have very unique breakfast not just your ordinary breakfast place. They have amazing pancakes and omelette. I got the Veggie Omelette and it was delicious. They are generous with their portion and you will not leave this place hungry. Also great coffee."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast experience I've had! Our waitress took 20 minutes to greet us, never told us her name ( short , Hispanic maybe? Black hair) Took our drink order then waited even longer to get our drinks. By this time we're ready to order but she is no where to be found. Finally got our food but didn't check on us till we finally flagged her down to tell her we needed our check and Togo order. Felt like she was ignoring us and rushing us out at the last minute. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"Ok! So there was a bit of a wait..20-30 mins for brunch...but service was fast and friendly! Everything tastes good here! I was satisfied with my meal and got exactly what I wanted. I'll just say it was worth the wait for a good brunch. It will be about $40 for a meal for 2 depending on what you get, but it's good, hearty options here. This place did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to eat here I have always left satisfied. Their eggs benedict is always delicious. Be sure to get there before the church crowd because the place will fill up fast!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Everything was very fresh tasting and cooked perfectly. Our server was very attentive and helpful when we had questions. Definitely one of my go to breakfast places in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Just OK. Way too expensive for the mediocre food you get. There's not much else to say. I would say Cracker Barrel is three times better and five times cheaper. Also, slow kitchen here."}
{"text":"You know how you grow to expect and like certain things when you go out?  Doesn't it suck when it changes?

I take my little princess out for breakfast this morning and had my heart set on the Yogurt and Fruit parfait.....a little pricey, but something I enjoyed.  They changed their menu and pulled it off.  Now, they have the fancy Chobani something or other.  $9.99 for a dollop of vanilla Chobani with some blueberries and strawberries mixed in.  It was in an overly sweet bakery type shell which was tasty, but dammit I'm tryin' to eat healthy.  They add some stale, out of season fruit to the plate and drizzle some honey on the plate to try and justify the price.  The value wasn't really there on the former Yogurt Fruit Parfait, and now it really isn't there.  

My daughter got the pancakes and we asked to add powdered sugar and whipped cream to it.  They NEVER remember the add on's but they do fix it.  I guess there's no button on their screen.  The service was lackluster and slow this time and I had to wait too long between \"touches\" which I guess was right on target with the experience.  I had a coupon from the City Pass book which I guess was a bright moment that I didn't wind up paying $40.00 for 3 people to eat breakfast.

Goodbye Another Broken Egg.....It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"Good food, long wait. Please hire extra weekend staff and OPEN up the back dining room. Your in business to do business and the business is there and hungry. You have loyal paying customers that came to pay to eat. Dont make them wait an hour to have a scrambled egg.  I have observed basically 2 ladies doing all the work in the front area one at the front desk and one in the bar. They need help!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us dined here for breakfast yesterday morning. always better during the weekend, no wait. This was our first experience, we had a dealsaver coupon. initial service was good but dropped off when we needed refills, waitress was MIA.
The food is fair and a little overpriced, but then this is Ballantyne area. Eggs benedict were very good, the potatoes that comes with everything were tasteless.
Poached eggs were underdone, the whites were runny....returned and cooked right. Pancakes and waffles also good. Strange though, if you want real maple syrup its an extra $1.59. 
Overall, this place is just ok. If you go on weekends, the wait time can be 45 mins."}
{"text":"Ok,nothing great. My waitress was super, rest of the staff was average and not really friendly. 
Bring a sweater, it's cold inside .... cannot stay for more than 20 min."}
{"text":"Had a classic omelet which was good. Service was also fair. Nothing extraordinary in my visit here, but a solid breakfast for sure. Overall looks like a pretty good spread for breakfast and lunch. I'll definitely give it another try next time in town. Waffles looked pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I've gone here about twice only because I really wanted to some grits and a biscuit.  Neither were that great.  The grits:  overly salted, lumpy, and too runny.  The biscuit: decent enough as far as biscuits go.  Didn't disappoint but didn't delight me either.  The potatoes:  way too salty for my taste.  

Maybe I'm sensitive to salt, but you guys really need to monitor that. I know it's breakfast food but at least be mindful of the sodium. I had no problems with the service on each of my visit, but I'm unlikely to return again."}
{"text":"Didn't wait more than 5 min on Saturday to get a table. Decor is nice and very \"homey.\" We ordered the biscuit beignet appetizer which sounded a lot better on the menu than it tasted. Dish concept was good but the actual powdered biscuits were kind of hard and felt like they had just been reheated. 

I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of grits, and my fiancé ordered an omelet. I think he enjoyed his omelet but mine was just ok. Again,  I thought the food tasted like it had been reheated and wasn't necessarily freshly made to order. Ham used in the dish was a thick cut and pretty flavorful. Grits were the best part of the meal - very creamy! 

Overall I'd give the food maybe a B. In my mind, breakfast is the first meal of the deal so nothing should be sitting out and have to be reheated. The restaurant was not busy so no excuse to not make everything fresh. May try again in the future but won't be rushing back. Seeing a few comments about there not being a wait for a Sunday brunch. If you don't have a wait for Sunday brunch in Charlotte, most likely you're not the brunch place of choice, and with a name like \"Another Broke Egg Cafe\", your breakfast should probably be good...."}
{"text":"This place gave my son and me the best service of our life! It was his 21st birthday and was busy later that day so it was his only birthday celebration. The staff was incredibly friendly and gave him a celebration to remember"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place in Charlotte! I was completely satisfied with my meal and the service was nice! I recommend the bacon and cream cheese omelet! Wear a sweater though because the restaurant was chilly."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous!!! We had the Lobster and Brie Omlette, Crab Cakes and Fried Green Tomatoes and French Toast. Our waitress recommended the City Grits and I'm delighted she did! They were incredible! Our waitress was awesome! We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!  We were greeted warmly as we entered the restaurant and seated right away.  Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly.  We ordered a little bit of everything, starting with the Biscuit Beignets.  They came out warm, coated in powdered sugar, so good!  The French toast bananas foster style was some of the best we've ever had, and the omelets we tried were also tasty.  If we are back in the Ballantyne area this will definitely be our go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot! Food is delicious, menu is extensive and service is great. Sweet potato pancake, skinny omelet, breakfast quinoa, and sausage patty are all fabulous! A definite go to in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Great service, crispy bacon, oatmeal stayed hot entire meal, fresh fruit. Only complaint was potatoes were to salty. Will be back..emily e was our fantastic server."}
{"text":"I personally have been to this location twice; let me say the interior is beautiful, very colorful and lively.. 
Unfortunately, I just didnt particularly  care for the food or the service. 
I went the first time with my entire family to try it out, I  ordered the crab cake benedict... I was very disappointed... in fact I didn't eat it all.  The service was mediocre..
In passing and on the way to taking my daughter to work one morning I thought I would give this location another try... Why?? I should have learned from the initial visit . My daughter and I both felt the same way. 
The waitress seemed as if she wasn't really interested in serving us and the food was really not all that good."}
{"text":"Good, consistent brunch place in South Charlotte. Lovee their scramblers! Had the Crescent City Scrambler with English Muffins and potatoes. Always have friendly service but waits can get long on the weekends. Family friendly and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is an upgrade from your normal breakfast fare, but delicious. If you want your normal eggs and bacon, this isn't your best option. The grits are stone ground. Service above average. A little too cold and I'm hot natured."}
{"text":"I am all about breakfast and brunch... I am also guilty of doing \"breakfast\" for dinner on occasion.  Another Broken Egg has been on my radar for a while and I have had several visits.  Each visit has never disappointed.

I do remember this place was another breakfast place at one point, but it seems that the new owners put their own touches to the place.  The wood paneling (originally just natural, stained wood) is painted with warm cozy colors.  The tables are copper with wood trim and are very clean.  It's almost like the place gives you a nice, grandma style hug to welcome you in.

They do have a rather extensive menu, but their signature items are marked with a small broken eggshell icon.  I highly recommend the shrimp and grits!  Also the Benedict Oscar is super awesome.  I'm a bit obsessed with poached eggs (mostly because I can't do them myself at home.... yet), but toss in some steak, asparagus, crab, and Bearnaise sauce, and you get one hell of a breakfast!

The servers are super super nice and just always a treat to eat here.  Probably my only complaint would be how popular the place can get so there could be a substantial wait depending on when you get there in the morning during peak breakfast weekend hours."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE!!!  You would have thought I screwed her husband the treatment we received.  We were seated and it took our waitress 10 mins to greet us.  Although there were 4 others standing around no one came to the table to say anything.  Once the server came she says, \"I know you guys been waiting a few minutes\", I corrected her and said more than a few.  At that time she ask for drinks, appetizers and meal.  She never came back to ask if we needed anything so. I had to flag down another server to bring syrup.  She then comes and fills up the jelly yet doesn't ask if everything was ok.  She finally ask us about the check so now we know her name is Susan.  She was terrible.  I will not return thanks to the service because the food was outstanding.."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the last year or so. The service was very poor and it took nearly 45min to get pancakes and eggs and we were a party of two. We spent nearly 2hrs here and not to mention when we did get our food it was totally cold. However, when I sent back a portion of my meal since it was cold I got the replacement in under 60 seconds, go figure. Even more disappointing is people who came in after us that were larger parties were getting served way before us! I gave two stars because the only redeeming feature was their Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Passing through Charlotte and happened to find this gem. Food was great atmosphere really nice and our waitress Iris was fantastic! Thank you"}
{"text":"Completely disorganised with unacceptable wait time for the number of customers in the place. The coffee is horrible."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Amazing iced coffee! I had the blueberry pancakes and eggs and my friend had the biscuits and gravy, both were beyond delicious! We will def be back and will def recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Southern spinach salad was pretty tasty and decent price. Came first lunch on Sar and had no wait. Servers were friendly just a tad slow but not too bad. If I was in the area again I would come back.

Location is kind of tucked in the corner so can be hard to see and park at peak times."}
{"text":"We waited around 20 minutes on a Saturday morning, which is what we were told the wait would be. We were surprised to see other parties that came in after us get seated sooner though. I enjoyed the grits, potatoes, and eggs. My biscuit was just ok, it didn't taste homemade. I also thought the turkey sausage was just ok. My husband got the BLT, which he enjoyed but was not a fan of the sauce that came on it. Overall just ok."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Food is good, but the service is not worth even walking into this place. Both times, terrible. It's probably the worst I have ever had, and it takes A LOT for me to write a bad review. Really, this takes the cake. We ordered, received our food, and proceeded to ask for silverware since we didn't have any at our table. She said they ran out of silverware so it would be a minute. We were literally one of four tables in the place, so what she was really saying was that no one has been back washing silverware. Two minutes later, she returned with dripping wet forks and knives in her hands that she said she \"rinsed off\". She then was examining the forks to make sure, and I quote \"that all the food is off of them\". So appetizing! Since they were dripping all over my food, I then asked for a napkin. Gasp! A customer asking for a napkin! And this was not only to sop up the puddle from the silverware that was pooling in front of me, but perhaps to wipe my hands, mouth etc. Crazy, I know! She huffed and puffed a little and then said she can give us plastic ware instead. Yes! Please!! Why didn't you think of that before?! Then as she went to get the plastic forks and knives (with their ever so convenient napkin already wrapped up) you heard her throw the other silverware as hard as she could into the sink. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. 

To say that this was a bizarre interaction with a member of a waitstaff at a restaurant would be an understatement. I will not be back. Not worth it. Not even a little bit! Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large party (maybe 20 ladies) for a brunch meeting (I didn't pick the place) I read the reviews  from fellow Yelpers before and I just knew it would mediocre. We were in a back room since the party was so  large. I thought we would be there alone but they sat other people back there. I knew it was probably difficult for them as we we doing ice breakers and several conversations were going on at one time. I order the crescent city scrambler, a side of city grits and the mango kiwi mimosa. I will start with the mimosa since that came first. It was delicious. I would say stir it up before you drink it. The mango syrup sits at the bottom. The drink is mostly champagne (I am not complaining though) The crescent city scrambler was good. The portion size to me was small. I finished all my food which I never do. I also ordered a side of city grits. Everyone raved about in their reviews as the one good thing and it did NOT disappoint. It is flavored with bacon grease and had bacon crumbles. I mean do I need to say anything else. Overall the food was good. I would come back if someone asked to go. TRY THE CITY GRITS. I took some pictures of my neighbors food as well. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Maybe I visit at just the right time, but I never seem to experience the extended wait times that others have mentioned. I should add that I have only frequented Another Broken Egg during the weekend brunch hours, so that may be key. The food is good.. Sometimes (not always) GREAT, but always good. The consistency is a bit lacking. I often order the exact same thing the exact same way and the preparation can still vary quite a bit from visit to visit. Like I said though, it's always good."}
{"text":"Since we are always on the lookout of a GREAT breakfast place, we had to check out the new Another Broken Egg when they opened.   My husband travels quite a bit and had been to Another Broken Egg in Florida and he loved it. so we thought it would be worth the trip to Southpark to give it a try.  We actually live much closer to the Ballantyne location, but after reading the initial negative reviews we thought it might be best to skip that one for now and try this one instead.   We're glad we did!  

We ventured in their first opening weekend.  We fully expected some hiccups along the way as they were still new and getting their rhythm down.  We anticipated correctly, but it was nothing major.  The waiter was such a sweet kid, but he was clearly a bit nervous and a little frazzled.  He did just fine though.  Several staff members stopped by to check on us and the Manager came over to chat with us for a few minutes, too.  He was about nice as one could be.  He was engaging, he clearly loves the company and his job, and he seems to have a great rapport with his staff.  

First off...the restaurant decor is so adorable and very homey!  It's a great first impression!   The menu is quite unique and extensive without being overwhelming.  I love that their menu includes breakfast and lunch items and is available at all time.  (I'm not always a breakfast food person, so the lunch items are perfect for me!)   Some items have a Cajun/Creole influence, which some people seem to enjoy.  

We opted for a couple of appetizers (I LOVE the idea of appetizers at breakfast!)...we ordered the Monster Cinnamon Roll  and the Biscuit Beignets (with Honey Marmalade dipping sauce).  I didn't try either of them (I'm trying to low carb...UGH!), but my husband and son enjoyed both of them very much.  My husband was especially fond of the Beignets and for someone who doesn't like Marmalade, he couldn't get enough of it!

My son ordered Steak and eggs.  He ordered his steak medium, but it came out medium-rare.  He still ate it and still enjoyed it very much.  The steak came with eggs and potatoes.  He loved the potatoes!  My husband had the Southwest Scramble and he loved it.  I had the Cafe Burgers (sans bun).  I ordered it Medium, but it came out almost rare so I had to send it back.  Once it was cooked correctly and they remembered to put the bacon back on, it was delicious!  It was seasoned nicely and the toppings were delicious...Bacon, Blue Cheese, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Roasted Onions, and a Garlic Aioli.   YUM!!

We liked it very much and will be sure to go back."}
{"text":"My husband went to Another Broken Egg in Louisana and really liked it.  So, he was excited to see them expanding into Charlotte.   When we heard that this location and South Park had both opened, we read the reviews on both and decided to try South Park first based on the unfavorable reviews for this location.  (I've posted a review for the South Park location, too)  However, when we received a Coupon deal, we decided to give this location a try since it's significantly closer to home.   We're so glad we did!   The service was excellent and the food was delicious!   Thankfully, we didn't experience any of the issues that have been posted here!

My husband and I are trying watch our waistlines so we decided to share a dish.  We had the Huevos Rancheros and it was delicious and more than enough for us to share.  We also ordered a side of fruit and was pleasantly surprised by the fruit selection...fresh raspberries, sliced cantaloupe, sliced kiwi, and sliced pears.  The fruit was very fresh and quite substantial for a \"side\".   The coffee was also quite good.  Next time we visit, I will be sure to take a picture of the Heuvos Rancheros to post here.  It looked as fantastic as it tasted!  

Our server was very friendly and attentive.  She was also happy to answer the handful of questions that we had about the menu.   During our meal, the Manager also stopped by our table to check on us and to ask if we enjoyed our meal.  She was very friendly, too!

The prices here are comparable to other local breakfast restaurants.  So, no complaints there either. 

I do need to say...I wish that Yelp had the option of giving a 1/2 star, because I probably would have gone with 4.5 stars instead of 4 and only for one reason....all of the food is fresh, but it appears that the breakfast potatoes are not made fresh.  Don't get me wrong, they were still very tasty and we ate them all, but fresh potatoes really would have kicked the rating to 5 stars for me.  So let me say...in my opinion, this should be a 4.5 star rating, but that wasn't an option...so I need to go with 4 stars.  If they had fresh potatoes, the rating would have been 5 stars.

We've been searching for a go-to breakfast place for several years and it looks like we may have found it.  Finally!    I can only hope that our future visits will be as good as our first one was.  (Keeping fingers crossed!)"}
{"text":"This morning was our first visit to ABE. The service and food was good (wait time was long & there were only two other tables seated), but the restaurant itself was a mess. Apparently the cleaning crew didn't show up; there was trash on the restaurant and bathroom floor and there was no toilet paper. We were presented with dirty silverware wrapped in a dirty napkin. Our Sugar in the Raw packets were moldy. TBH, next time I'll go to Flying Biscuit or iHop."}
{"text":"Second time here. This time with the hubby and it was great. The bacon was just like I like it ... crispy!!! We will definitely come here again. It's a bit of a drive since there the one near us is closed but well worth it!!! And I love the mugs!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I tried this place out for our monthly meet up. The food was great,  it's somewhere we plan on visiting again. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Try the cinnamon roll pan cakes."}
{"text":"9 months ago, I posted this: 
Called ahead to get wait time as this would be my 2nd attempt to try the brunch cuisine Another Broken Egg had to offer..1st attempt we didn't get seated due same issue, being told one wait time and upon arrival, having to wait much later.
We were finally  seated  this 2nd go around after waiting 20 minutes when we were told 5 min wait on the phone. (We were in the parking lot)

Our 1st server (yes 1st server) took our drink order and after she served them, became \"too busy\" to take our order, so someone else obliged us.  Our food arrived luke warm. Did I mention that we were told several  times that the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes frequently? This is where I grew a disdain. We arrived at 1:10pm... waited to be seated for approximately 20 mins...after being told it was a 5 min wait.
Server situation took an additional 20-25 mins. Now the server  has mentioned at least 4x how the restaurant closes SOON.

I give every place a 5 starting out. As the visit progresses, whatever happens dictates my ratings. I allowed myself to get excited about a mediocre restaurant just by reading the menu online. NEVER DO THAT!

I will not recommend this establishment to anyone. My Bloody Mary was the silver lining. So disappointed!


TODAY:
Better service and no wait time is what the difference was. Other than that, the lobster brie omelette tastes more like imitation crab and brie. The brie was sliced thickly this visit which overwhelmed everything else.
The temperature of the food was served luke warm again. 
I can't seem to win with this location. I actually have given up. No more attempts to be made."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! 

I came on a sunday morning and got sat right away. Server was great and very friendly. I forgot what his name was, oops! I ordered the city grits and a side of turkey sausage links. City grits were amazing. I'm not a huge grits fan but with all the added toppings to it, I couldn't resist. It has bacon, green onions and tomatoes on topped. I added a bit of hot sauce to it and it was amazing!! I will definitely get that again!! Turkey sausage links were good, but a bit pricey for what you got. 

My husband got an omelette thought it was good. Came with potatoes. He added salsa to it and was pretty pleased. Our friend got got sausage and gravy biscuits with scrambled eggs and ate the whole thing. Our other friend got the benedict and loved it!! 

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in all of Charlotte area. Everything on the menu has a unique twist on breakfast staples. Servers are helpful and friendly. I really love that you can give the hostess your number when there is a wait and they text you when your table is ready. I really recommend the Cinnamon Roll French toast. It is amazing!!! Also their house hot sauce is delicious. The restaurant is decorated very tastefully and feels very homey."}
{"text":"Went way down in quality! Yikes haven't been here in a while and big sad changes to food. Yuk. Never again. 

Service was good so that had not changed...small blessing over very gross food. And yes it's what I always order, yet now tastes bad."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The menu sounds fantastic.  Unfortunately, that's where it stops.  I had the crab cake benedict.  It was so fishy it wasn't edible.  My wife had regular eggs benedict.  The poached eggs were cooked completely through, solid yokes.  Potatoes that come on the side are completely bland.  I guess I know why we were able to get a table on Sunday morning so quickly."}
{"text":"The ABE in Ballantyne is my hangout; I was up in the South Park area one day, and needed a place to park myself for 2 hours in the morning.  Having a point of reference to compare to, I can say the food was pretty much the same, but the service was not nearly as good at this location as the one in Ballantyne.  It was clean and quiet, and in a nice location, so all in all, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in this place right now.  I just had a great omelette; they call it the Baquezo, and it is wonderful!
The service was great, the food was great...I have no complaints at all.

A word of advice - DON'T GO TO BRUNCH ON SUNDAY IN CHARLOTTE.  99% of the city goes to church, then breakfast/brunch.  Every restaurant in the city is packed to the rafters, and everything suffers (food, service, etc.).  No restaurant is a positive experience on Sunday mornings here."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse Frittata is reason enough to go!! By far the TASTIEST dish that I have ever had at this chain. Their coffee is always hot and delicious too. Their skinny omelet is also always a go to for me if the specials aren't too appealing. Service is a hit or miss depending on what location you're at, but most have proved to always be busy and on a wait on the weekends, so get there early!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 11 on a Thursday morning and the place was pretty full. I think they were understaffed or something because the service was annoyingly slow. I think we saw our waiter 3 times during the entire meal. We spent more time waiting for the food and later the check than actually eating. I ordered coffee, and the mug was cute, but the coffee was very average - definitely not worth $2.69. I also never got a refill :( 

I ordered the Hey Lucy omelette because I saw the word avocado listed as an ingredient. It wasn't bad but could have used more filling (I tasted maybe two slices of avocado? sad.) They were pretty generous with the layer of cheese on top though. The overall portion size was great. The omelette came with toasted english muffin and potatoes. 

I might come back when I feel like spending $16 on subpar service and slightly above average  food."}
{"text":"A little bit of a wait both for seating and to order but we'll worth it! I had waffle sliders and they were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"First visit.  My mother is in town so I made a week of visiting places I've never been.  Mom wanted breakfast so I took here here since I've heard good things and pass it often in the evening (when the restaurant is closed.)

It took a few minutes to be acknowledged and seated.  Once seated, the server was quick with the drink order.  Unfortunately, the specialty coffee machine was broken.  The food was fresh and delivered within ten minutes.

I got the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was flavorful and crispy, unfortunately a bit dry and over cooked.  Then waffle was sweet so I ate it with butter only.

I don't review other people's food but in this case I will.  My mom had the Floridian omelet which is a cream cheese filled omelet topped with crab meat.  My mom didn't like the crab so I tasted it.  It tasted old or like it was close to being spoiled.  She let our server know and my mom got a replacement omelet without the crab.  The server gave a discount on the omelet so she was charged for a cheese omelet.

I will definitely think of visiting this place for breakfast or brunch in the future."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot and am looking forward to going again.

The service was spectacular.  I thought the hostess was really friendly and she was all smiles.  Friends and I walked into this spot after golf for some late breakfast.  She kindly showed us the menu and explained a few items.  I was sold.

The food came out relatively quick, and tasted really good.  We came at the tail-end of the afternoon lunch rush.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, and my buddy had the rancheros huevos.  I've never had shrimp and grits before (really!) but if I did, this is the place to get it.  I've had grits before but this place does it right--not too watery and not too pasty.  For a bland-looking dish, it was packed with flavor.  I couldn't finish my plate because it was a tad bit oily from the yummy sausage pieces.  My friend devoured his dish though.  We both walked away full and pretty happy about the place.  Affordable too!

I'll be coming back soon.  Keep it up everyone!

dmo out."}
{"text":"I love the food here but had a horrible first experience with service so I wanted to give it another shot. Yeah it sucked again. Everything from the hostess to waitress. I can get good food somewhere else. Save your time and DONT go here (at least the southpark location)."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait time and it took them an hour too prepare our order. There are many other options around for breakfast and I don't recommend this place unless u r dying for a pancake"}
{"text":"Not a restaurant we will come back to.  It took an hour and 10 minutes to get our food. Service was slow and food was not very hot. There were 8 of us (including 4 children). No manager ever came around and the server took over 10 minutes to return with our drinks. The fact that we had to wait so long and that the management did not even come to our table is not a good sign that they have issues. I have been to other Another Broken Egg locations and never have had an experience like this"}
{"text":"Great weekday breakfast for the companies nearby - service has always been pretty good and coffee is good!!!  They offer mini beignets which are \"ok\" - but I'd suggest skipping and ordering your meal - it comes quick, so there's no need for the \"breakfast appetizer\" ;) I think some of the staff came from Briggs, which is good - I always loved that place. I've never ordered the gluten free pancake here, but I hear it's fantastic - I always get the oh-so-reliable omelette.... Tasty and HOT! My son (toddler) gets the oatmeal and eats every last bite (it's the good oatmeal - none of that quick oats nonsense!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow the waitress were standing around while we were waiting to have our to go order taken. I ordered the grits. The container was half full and the grits were very watered down. No flavor no seasoning just plain watered down grits! Never again!"}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere: feels homey. Food was good, but we waited an hour for a simple waffle and scrambled eggs. Server was unamused and to himself. Seemed to have avoided us because the food took forever. We waited and watched three other tables get there food before us even when we arrived first."}
{"text":"The omelet is ok 'pancakes  is saggy  waffles is not good ."}
{"text":"Called ahead, seated about 10 min. after arrival.  The hostess was friendly, but once we were seated we waited for drinks, for silverware.  We ended up waiting 1 hour for our food.  My omelet had the stem of the avocado in it, not worth the wait.  A friendly attentive waiter can often make up for a long wait, but we did not have a waiter like that.  The manager gave us half off our order."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go if you just want brunch on a Sunday without experiencing a long long wait time.

I didn't try any of the hot dishes, but a friend of mine ordered the gluten free pancake and she said that it was actually really good.  I ordered the fruit parfait and it was warm and just not all that great.  I ate it, though, since I was starving.  

Mimosas came out a little on the warm side and on the weak side.  It would be nice if they had a brunch special on Sat and Sun that offered a reduced price mimosa and bloddy mary.  I can find a better bloddy mary for half the price of 6 bucks elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST visit. The food is always good and the staff take pride in making sure you are well satisfied. If anything is ever wrong they will correct it immediately. This is a must try. The Lake Shore is wonderful as is the Skinny Omelet they have this wonderful mix with quinwa (sp) and Coconut milk that is to die for. Private meeting space for weekday use is an added plus!"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with this place after hearing some good things.  Everything on the menu is disgustingly expensive.  I got the crab, cream cheese, and brie omelette.  The crabmeat was very greasy, or maybe it was from the abundance of cheese. It definitely wasn't worth over $10.  The service was pretty slow even though there was only one other table in the restaurant. I was just really upset that I paid so much for not being satisfied. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was pretty awful. 30 minute wait to get seated, I'm guessing because they were understaffed because there were plenty of open tables. Once seated, my wife ordered a latte and I ordered a reserve coffee with Kahlua. She got her latte is about 5 minutes, my coffee didn't arrive until 35 minutes later, which was after our food had arrived and we had eaten it. Also, on a side note, I don't drink Kahlua often but I'm highly doubtful that my coffee even had any Kahlua in it; either that or there was so little that it was unnoticeable. I was really expecting that slight warmth of the liqueur but all I tasted was a bland coffee taste. Not to mention my water sat empty for 15 minutes from before the food arrived and was never filled. The only reason they get 2 stars is the food was really good. Other than that it was a pretty terrible experience."}
{"text":"I had been hesitant to try this place because of the mixed reviews.  The food and the waitress were both stellar.  The 20 year old host seating everyone had zero personality.  He stared with a blank look, jaw slightly dropped as I walked up, then waited for me to speak.  Definitely not the best greeter.  My omelet was perfect, the \"Hey Lucy\" I believe.  I did a substitution of the side and they charged me nothing extra.  The food was fast, hot, and had all the accompanying ( butter, salsa, etc) right there in good size containers.  It is not a cheap place.  $2.69 for coffee.  The waitress did keep it filled for me.  Overall, I will be back, but I don't see this as a regular morning stop.  They seem to cater to the breakfast meeting crowd or the 10:00am breakfast with a Bloody Mary crowd."}
{"text":"Gotta say I love this place!  Always provides quick service and the staff is very assertive!  I usually choose this place for weekend breakfast gatherings with family and friends!  Only reason it's missing a star is because of the hostess,  who always seems overwhelmingly anxious and somewhat panicked.."}
{"text":"Friendly,  courteous, funny staff. Enjoyed the Chez B omelette that was delicious. Biscuit was perfectly fluffy and the coffee kept coming."}
{"text":"Yummo!! Favorite breakfast so far!  You MUST order the City Grits!!! Unreal. So delicious and creamy, with just enough cheese and theyre topped with bacon pieces, scallions, and diced tomatoes. OMG! The biscuits and gravy were to die for. Flavorful gravy and nice pieces of sausage on theit fluffy biscuit. My BF had some the Hey Lucy omelette loaded with cheese and chorizo and and came with sour cream. He said it was delish!!. Coffee wasn't great, but I'm having a hard time finding good coffee anywhere except Terrace café. But, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here, I got chicken and waffles. The chipotle syrup for the meal had a little kick to it. The chicken can be a little more moist but overall it was enjoyable to eat. Got a side of Home fries and they tasted good. 

I'd def go back to this location for breakfast and Brunch. Service was quick didn't have a wait. Super cute interior."}
{"text":"Tried the black bean burger.. it was yumm..dont let the whole garlic cloves throw you off track. It added great taste.. will also mention..the servers are great warm and very welcoming.. talk about breakfast like a king.."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. And it was not congested like the usual Saturday morning restaurants."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see a new restaurant in the location Skillets had occupied on Community House Road. I was even more thrilled to find a coupon for a free omelette in my mailbox. So I decided to hike on over and take a taste. That was a mistake.

I took a seat at the counter and perused the menu. Omelettes and eggs benedict occupied most of the menu, all at prices of $10 and over. All of the omelette options were unusual and I didn't see a make your own option. As I watched food come out of the kitchen, it seemed very disorganized. The staff don't appear to have any system under control just yet.

I went with Stan's #1 - an omelette with shrimp, crawfish, ham mushrooms and cheese. It was not something I would normally order, but for free, I was willing to give it a shot, as I liked all of the ingredients in forms other than omelettes. I asked them to make sure the eggs were cooked, as i hate runny eggs. When the dish arrived, it was bone dry. The crawfish tasted old and the shrimp was about the only edible part of the creation. Unlike the omelette, the english muffin that came with it was not crispy. The highlight of the meal were the seasoned country potatoes, which were salty but good. Had I been paying for the dish, I would have sent it back and gotten something else.

When I got my bill, I was stunned to discover the charge for my unsweet tea was $2.69! Really?! So glad I got the to-go cup. 

Because of the convenience of the location, I may try it again, but no more omelettes for me. Can't recommend this place at this time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  Don't know why, but I had high expectations.

To begin with, the person running front of house was overwhelmed.  It wasn't that busy, but she seemed very flustered.  Someone asked her if they could have a cup of coffee or a drink while they waited for the table and it looked like she was having hard time deciding if that could be pulled off.

Our waiter was very nice and animated but seemed a little forgetful.  I had told him I didn't want any more Coke and about 5 minutes later he brought a fresh one anyway.  After taking our order, he came up to us asking where our menus where like he had forgotten that he took our order.  I also saw him drop a knife on the floor and he didn't pick it up.  It was just left there for a few minutes until someone else noticed it and picked it up.

On to the food.  I had the crab cake benedict and while it didn't taste bad, it sure wasn't great either.  I'd call it more like deviled crab benedict, there wasn't a lot of crab flavor.  I even closed my eyes and ate it to see if I thought it was crab without looking at it.  I found that I couldn't tell if it was a crab cake.  The menu said the hollandaise sauce was \"infused\" with Andouille sausage but I found when it was served that it actually had chunks of sausage with it.  It didn't go together well.  Also, the green and red peppers served on the dish were too raw.  Finally, the egg was not poached well.  The yolk was way too runny for a poached egg.

My wife's omelet was good, according to her.  It was on the smaller size for the price, IMO.  Also, she asked for grits instead of potatoes.  What she got was grits AND potatoes and we were charged for both.  That's fine if they don't sub, but the waiter didn't mention it.  Same deal with the biscuit instead of the English muffin.  No mention of the upcharge."}
{"text":"Really yummy brunch spot! The potato sensations was very good, along with the (huge) pancake flight. Good portions and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went in around noon for brunch. I ordered chicken and waffles and was told they ran out of chicken. So I ordered a drink and breakfast for my son.  Service was good, but the menu didn't have anything else that was appealing to chose an alternate option. I have tried several items on previous visits but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast and it was a disaster. They aren't equipped to handle any crowds. The hostess kept running around and asking people what their pager numbers - why? I have no clue. Our table was dirty upon being seated. It took awhile to be waited on. The hostess cleaned a table and then put the towel on the floor then picked it up later to use again. Another hostess kept wiping his nose with his hands and shirt. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great service, yummy food, and honest people. I left my wallet there yesterday with lots of cash and called today and they had it there waiting for me untouched. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Not only is the food delicious every time I go, but the owner and staff are wonderful. I go here at least once a month for breakfast and always bring my out of town friends. ABE never disappoints! I highly recommend the biscuit beignets. You must go here, do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I don't often review unless I've been to a place multiple times, but this morning kinda made me feel like I need to say something. I'll update the review when I go back. 

So a lot of the reviews on this location are poor based on service, and I knew that going in (although they have the \"People love us on yelp\" sticker...I kinda walked in snarkily thinking \"Are you sure they do? Really?\"). I can't say that I experienced any better service than the reviews on here. 

Let's cover the food first: The food is good. I'd love to be back and try other things on the menu. We ordered beignets and 'monster' cinnamon rolls to start, and both were great! Beignets were a little denser than I'm used to (they used funnel cake batter) and the cinnamon rolls were pretty good as well! For the main meal, I got their version of biscuits and gravy, with eggs, sausage, and hash browns. The biscuits were great, sausage was alright, potatoes were great. Server didn't ask what style eggs I wanted (on the menu it says 'any style', and they came out scrambled, which i don't like, so I didn't try them. 

The service was pretty dang bad. Our waitress didn't really understand timeliness, nor communication, nor personal bubbles. Throughout the entire meal she was uncomfortably close and physical with multiple people in our party. Coffees took about 7-8 minutes to get out, an order of hot chocolate took about 15, our appetizers took about 20 minutes, and then our main courses probably took about 35-40 minutes. We were STARVING by the time our food came. The only update that we got was about 30 seconds before the food came out as well.  When the bill came, one of our checks had a mystery \"iced coffee\" on it that we had to request removal as well. And our waitress' response? \"What in the what? That is SO strange!\" ... You're the one who input it!!! Don't act so surprised! Ugh.

Anyways, folks, I'll be back because the food was definitely decent, but I hope next time the service picks up."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and they were busy, ended up sitting at the bar because of the wait. The decor is super cute, the place is not very large... The menu is big, lots of tasty selections and different options. We settled on shrimp and grits, huevos rancheros and a side of biscuit and gravy. BF said the shrimp and grits were some of the best ever.. the huevos rancheros were decent, I should have added the chorizo on.. it came with two crispy fried tortillas which was too much on top of the fried potatos.. there was not enough black bean/peppers served with it, salsa was good. The biscuit was disappointing.. it was $4 (I think) for one biscuit and gravy.. both were COLD... cold biscuit I would have been ok with, but the cold gravy was bleh... I think hot it would have been pretty darn good. Prices could be considered high but look at the area it is in and it fits right in."}
{"text":"Adequate- clean, decent food, but somewhat overpriced. My pancake was a little undercooked but eggs were fine. The potato entree with small wedges of potatoes with cheese and three other items (eg bacon, mushrooms) was a small portion with very few bits of the \"sides\". Would have been acceptable as a $5-$6 item, but disappointing at $9.99.  So overall, nothing wrong with the place but just nothing special in my eyes."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The staff are super nice and very quick. The breakfast is one the best around the area -- perfect french toast/waffles and tasty coffee. They also offer up coffee to-go which I love -- and it always seems to be on the house!

We've gone a few times between 9am - 11am. It's been relatively quiet and get a seat right away. 

Big fan."}
{"text":"Breakfast is very good and they feature many traditional breakfast items and some eclectic choices too.   The Belgium waffle has a slight vanilla flavoring and is quite good.  Comes with two eggs and breakfast meat.  I had the black stone eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise was light and tasty.  Michelle was our server and she was very pleasant and supportive to the temperature in the restaurant as my dad was freezing.  Coffee cups remained full.  Only recommendation I can offer is to teach the bus boys to clear with small trays.  It would help expedite table turns quicker.
Great breakfast and we will return."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Another Broken Day Sunday afternoon, knowing there would probably be a wait. Upon arrival we were told 20-25 minutes which wasn't bad, however, we spotted two open seats at the counter so we decided to go that route. 

As we reviewed the menu, being first timers, we were greeted and placed our drink order. The bloody mary, my choice, had too much horseradish so I replaced mine with a mimosa, much better. After looking over the menu I chose a scrampler, with potatoes and an english muffin.  The scrampler was okay, but the potates were very dry and bland.  The service was hit or miss, as our waitress seemed to be working the counter, other tables and assisting in running food from the kitchen.  So, water and coffee refills, requests for butter and jelly, etc. took a little while.  Overall the food and service was just okay. Nothing to run back to in my mind."}
{"text":"I have to say, I've only been to this restaurant twice. The first time was amazing. The server was polite, asking if we needed anything, and our food was prepped according to order. Yesterday- this place took a turn for the worst. The waiter never refilled drinks, gave us a frown and scowl when we asked for hot water for tea. Took my plate and I had to grab my English muffin before it was whisked off. We were never asked how our food was, if we needed anything, or offered a box. Very disappointed with this experience as it was a business meeting. I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't realize until I popped in here that Another Broken Egg is a chain of restaurants. I'd been to the one in Birmingham AL a few weeks back.

My veggie omelet was quite decent but the coffee refills were slow. Home fries were crazy hot but after the cooled enough to eat, they were tasty. The English Muffin was a little on the underdone side.

No wifi service in the restaurant. And strangely, I got zero bars on T-Mobile. So if you're thinking of using your phone to read the news while you breakfast, think again.

And yes, parking is a major pain!"}
{"text":"While waiting for my car at the AAA across the shopping plaza, I headed here for a late breakfast. Not too busy when I arrived, I had no idea that people were waiting when I left. My waitress did not seem to mind that I sat for an extra bit with my laptop (free wifi!) while drinking a third cup of coffee.

I chose the huevos rancheros for brekkie, after I'd already enjoyed a half order of their beignets. The beignets were tasty (covered in powdered sugar) and still hot, but a little too hard for my taste. Not light at all. The eggs arrived shortly after. Properly cooked and with the usual black beans and spicy cheese and salsa, on top of two grilled tortillas. I found the tortillas to be way too hard from being grilled, so after fighting with them and a knife, I opted to slide them out and ignore them. The home fried potatoes mixed into the eggs and beans and salsa were excellent and I enjoyed the rest of my meal.

Great service from Emma and a good meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could add an extra half star as it really deserves a bit more then 3. We waited almost 50 minutes to be seated then another 15 for water or coffee. It was very cold inside and prices for what is was, a bit high. I got the skinny omelet which was okay but I asked for no cheese and got cheese anyway. I mentioned it to the server and my meal was comped, which earns hen a star I think. The pancakes were generously sized and good according to the other guests, coffee a bit dull, but nice fruit. Wouldn't really recommend it but do appreciate the professionalism of coming the meal."}
{"text":"My niece and I came here for our weekly brunch date.  It was very packed and parking was a nightmare. We didn't have a long wait to be seated, maybe 10 minutes. Our waiter was very nice and efficient. It took what seemed like forever for our food to come out. more than 30 minutes for sure. I was not happy at all with my meal I ordered the fried green tomatoes and crab cakes. The tomatoes were decent but those flat skimpy crab cakes, they could keep em. They didnt serve V8 which was another negative. My niece asked for strawberries on top of her pancakes and they sliced cold strawberries and put them on top, she told him that she wanted more of the warm syrupy strawberry concoction. Overall I wish that I would have passed on this place. The one thing that was good were the grits other than that a definite miss, definitely not on our list for our \"Brunch with Bae\" dates."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far with many more to go I'm sure. Each time the food, waitstaff, and drinks were good. If you like Bloody Marys please treat yourself to one here because they are the BOMB!!!! The food is eggcellent too!! I love the atmosphere the Decor is nice and comforting and it's just an overall good place to go eat. I like to go on days that I've played bookie from work. Try this place."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have had in a restaurant ever! I am a former server. From seating down at the breakfast bar to leaving the restaurant was bad! 
1.service was really bad
2.watch other people order after me and get their food before me
3.the food wasn't that great. I got a omelet and a pancake that I never got syrup for. The girts were nasty. 
4.watch expo touch dirty dishes with gloves on and went back to the window pulling out people food to go out to tables. Never change his gloves!
5.watched my server be on his cell phone only a few feet away from me. Also saw him take food that was made wong from the window and sit it to the side and use his hand and shove the food in his mouth.
There was so many other things I witness while being in that restaurant I will never step foot in this place to eat ever again!"}
{"text":"We got seated on the outdoor patio but decided to go inside after we placed our order as it was too hot and dust was being kicked up towards us from big trucks passing by on the road before us.  Our waitress asked the manager to move us inside but to allow her to keep us as her table.  The manager refused, which was odd considering our waitress was serving the table right next to us inside. Some uncomfortable politicking going on there.  

Our new waitress brings out 3 of the 4 meals we ordered saying the 4th will be out soon.  15 minutes later, my daughter's meal arrives.  I dig in to my Bokeyzo omelet to find they have completely left the cream cheese out which leaves the omelet bone dry and completely unpalatable.  I tell our waitress who says \"I got you\", but I wait over 20 minutes for the replacement which never comes.  They say it's coming out soon, or they can box it up to go which I decline since I've already picked off my family's meals as I was starved waiting.  

Just an overall unpleasant, weird vibe.  Absolutely will not return with so many better options in the area.  It's too bad as I generally am very happy at the other ABE locations.  If the GM is reading this, I hope you get out to this location and clean it up.  It's a shame to see this at a generally good franchise."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Another Broken Egg Cafe and overall it was pretty good. We walked in about a half hour before close and from the waiters and waitresses flying around it seemed that they were fairly busy. We had a nice conversation with the hostess who sat us towards the back of the restaurant. 

The waitress was extremely friendly and was back to check on us every now and again always filling up empty glasses. 

It was odd because the people around us seemed to be complaining a lot about the time it took to get their for (45 minutes). When we go out to eat time is really not a huge deal, since we are enjoying the experience. With that said, it did take about a half hour to get our food, but it was DELICIOUS!

We both ordered the scrambled eggs with English muffins, sausage/bacon, and breakfast potatoes. The portion size was perfect and I didn't feel sick afterwards.

We would definitely stop back in here again for a small breakfast."}
{"text":"Crowded, not because of the rush of people but because the front foyer is extremely small!! There is no where to wait without being in the way of the numerous hostess running back and forth from the podium to the seating area. 

The food was alright, but nothing to rave over - typical greasy spoon. I had the veggie omelet - the big cloves of garlic & goat cheese was great, but the veggies were not cooked all the way through (red pepper and asparagus) which made it all a bit crunchy..

Best Tip about this place: You can call ahead to put your name on the wait list... And they have booze! Godiva chocolate liqueur in coffee so good!"}
{"text":"I love this place - I lived right near the original Broken Egg Cafe when I lived in Louisiana so I was super pumped when I learned the Charlotte area had a franchise as well. 

I almost always go with an omelette because you get a huge omelette, arguably some of the best home fries around, AND and english muffin. There's no way you're leaving hungry. But they also have a bunch of yummy sweet options if that's more your speed, and I swear one of these times I will try one of the benedicts or lunch options. I really don't think there is a bad option here. 

The prices can get up there depending on what you get but in general the items range from $9-15 which I would say isn't absurd. The service was pretty great too, so between the atmosphere, service, and food I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"First let me say... I love breakfast!  So I was very excited to try this place.  I ordered two eggs sunny side up... They were not sunny  but I like eggs any way you can cook them so that was ok.  They don't have any wheat bread so the multi grain was very good.  The fresh OJ was awesome, bacon was crispy just liked I asked and the grits came with blackberries if you wanted.  Of course, I like trying new things so I had blackberry grits... The salty sweet taste was wonderful!!  So overall under $15.00... The OJ was almost $4.00 so not so bad.  I will be back.  They open at 7:00am!!!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere but overpriced crappy food and terrible service. Wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Had a bit of time before work so I decided to give this place a try. I asked the waitress for recommendations. She told me that everything was good except the Sausage Patties. I didn't see Turkey bacon on the menu & I haven't eaten the yolk of an egg in so long and now have an intolerance for it so I ordered the Skinny Omelet, sub Goat Cheese for Parmesan. The omelet was mediocre. Looked like something I could make at home. And they just kind of threw some parmesan cheese on top instead of cooking it into the omelet or even inside the fold. Also i couldnt find a single Garlic Clove. No effort at all. I saw some other omelets that I'd like to try on the menu but the little omelet I got today came to $12 & wasn't even that great. I think I'll stick to the Omelets at The Flying Biscuit in this area for now."}
