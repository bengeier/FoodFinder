{"text":"It was quick, reasonably priced, service was very nice.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious. The Greek salad was good (not great) but did have delicious olives."}
{"text":"I believe thus place is only above 3 starts because it is next to several hotels.  The food is more Americans than Greek and the atmosphere is very much like a fast food restraunt.  The gyro was bland, but edible and the drink selection was minimal (only soda and water).  This place is great if you are to lazy to venture from 1000 feet from your hotel.  I'd go someplace else if you can cook.  3 stars are for location and waiting staff."}
{"text":"Great place. Obsessed with the Gyros. Love taking my friends here for lunch because of the peaceful quiet environment."}
{"text":"we had a great dinner.  It is casual and  you get a good serving of food.   I had flounder. large portion.  My wife had popcorn shrimp. It too was a large serving.  You order at counter and they bring it to the table.    Hamburger on pita bread. You can also by phone and pick up at window."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch. Food was great. Ha d chicken pita & onion rings. service was exceptional, food was fresh & fast! Glad I tried it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating in our ordering. Service 5 .   Menu choices are not as broad range as some of the other locations. Restaurant was clean, orderly and inviting.    All in all, if you are wanting your standard items such as Super C's, Fish Sandwich,  Pita's, Shrimp plate, Gyros then come here. If you are seeking the BBQ go to another location.  Otherwise, food was great!!! Again, hats off to the staff for exceptional customer service! !!"}
{"text":"-2 stars cuz a group of employees socializing is revolting to see as a former military chef and present customer civilian.   From before we got there (1430hrs) to after we were done (1500), the social hens waste the business owner's dime while the cooks still work. This might fly if this was the military and you can't get fired, but here? No. Oh no no. If y'all wanna talk about dieting and nutrition, get off your hiney, and get active. And split your \"breaks\" so I don't have to post this crap on Yelp. I'm usually positive but no. Memories of the Navy surfaced. So no thanks.   Great food. Thank you, kitchen staff, for a meal that even my luxury-eater kid ate entirely. Fish Sammy excellent. Could use extra tartar or less fish. No biggie.   Who's the manager? Mandate fewer females on job because it seems this happens. I'd be finding them something to do because there is always PLENTY to clean in kitchen or dining floor. Can we say field day?"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and always got our order correct. The service was excellent! I like that there is someone who comes and checks on your and refills your drink for you so you don't have to get up.  One of the employees also remembered that we were newbies to showmars and welcomed us back on our second visit!"}
{"text":"Perched high atop a hill at the 321 and I-85 junction, Showmars delivers it familiar fast caz fare in a slightly stripped down menu form, but still with the classic gyros and pita burgers.  The gyro platter is just a mess of food for anyone who has been on the road for a spell to recharge with -- really good gyro meat and a quality Greek salad that rivals some table service joints. The tzatziki sauce is just   thin enough to run into all the nooks and crannies of your pita-meat jam-up. Now a want another one."}
{"text":"If you happen to find yourself on 85 near Charlotte in search of some delicious food, I can't recommend Shomar's highly enough. It is an order-at-the-counter type place but with an extensive menu of Greek items as well as burgers and a great selection of side items. We got Greek salads with gyro meat. They were honestly about as good as 've had in any Greek restaurant - a nice bowl of fresh mixed greens, cabbage, onions, etc plus a generous amount of feta cheese, pepperocini, olives, etc and a good portion of good quality gyro meat. Outstanding! Our food was brought to our table by a super friendly server and when we asked for Tzaziki sauce she came right back with 2 servings for each of us. Apparently the salads are usually served in a taco bowl or with pita instead, though we opted out of both of those. The unsweet tea was fresh and delicious and our server checked back and got refills for us. Showmar's is really doing things right and was a particularly pleasant surprise to find in roadside SC."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food is consistent, the staff is friendly, the store is clean, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Looks great and the food was wonderful! Though I do wish there was a little more seasoning on the chicken nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix. Added feta to my chicken pita because well I love feta and i feel like it brings the whole sandwich together."}
{"text":"Excellent fish sandwich and fries. Staff was very friendly and talked to us like people not just customers."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I ordered the gyro- great pick  I also ordered the fish chili- I know doesn't sound good but was delicious! Very clean quick service style. Team members checked on us throughout my meal I will def be back Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Honestly say I'm not a fan. The place is clean, servers are attentive and pleasant. Maybe I'm just not into fast food greek style? Idk.  The onion rings were good, not great. My pork pita was not this amazing thing as the server had described it.  The meat in my husband's gyro was the best thing other than theor in house tzatziki sauce which was THE best thing we had. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Walking in I expected to place my order and getting my food. Instead it was brought to my table and the kind waitress checked up on me asking if I needed anything. I appreciated the refill on water. The Gyro sandwich was great and fries were tasty. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place has great food and they are not stingy with their portions....A business that is ran very professional!"}
