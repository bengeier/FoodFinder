{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday because we were in the area. This place exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend ordered pulled pork sandwich and I got 2 pulled pork sliders. The food was delicious and bbq sauce was amazing. The place is decorated with beautiful pictures of az and some other interesting decor. The waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"BBQ so good you won't even want the excellent sauces! Nice quiet out of the way place with a little bar. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! And Ms. Nancy was the best!!! Definitely a place to visit more than once!!"}
{"text":"I love the baby back ribs, Chicken wrap, Potato salad, The Boss hog and fried chicken wings. And the nicest people. The cleanest place I know. A rating."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork, my wife had the brisket.  Both sandwiches piled high. No skimping on the meat. A little dry and didn't seem to have that smokey flavor but both were clean cuts of meat. Lady/owner? Was the only one there. Her employee a no show and no call. She managed well for just one person."}
{"text":"I'm a harsh judge of BBQ being born and raised in East Texas. for this reason i feel i have to speak up on this place.. Had a craving for some brisket today so I checked this place out....hardly bbq at all. It's basically oven baked beef sliced thin like you would get at the deli. crazy talk! didn't have much smoky flavor either.  anyone could make better brisket on their first try than this. iced tea was watered down colored water too. terrible. all around bad food. the service was ok and prompt but i won't be back."}
{"text":"The best brisket I have ever had. I have been back 3 times very consistent.
All their meats are good, my wife loves the pull pork. Reasonably priced.
If you like BBQ you must try this place."}
{"text":"I don't normally review restaurants but this one needs to be experienced. We ordered the brisket, tri tip, and mack and cheese skillet. Everything was great but the brisket was amazing!"}
{"text":"A fabulous find! The full rack of ribs was perfectly done and enough to split by three. The potato pancakes were perfect. Be careful when ordering the ice cream because it was such a large portion we could have split that also.
Excellent food."}
{"text":"We had a holiday party in the valley. We needed dinner before our trip to PAYSON. We like BBQ and this place was on our route. I ordered Ribs, my husband ordered the combo platter of brisket and spicy link. We were so pleased with the food. We both really loved it. 

The business is establishing itself since August. There were not many customers at 8PM on a Monday night. Don't let that deter you. The BBQ is fabulous."}
{"text":"Great bbq.  Newly remodeled.  Awesome prices.  Love to eat here regularly. I'm not sure why this place isn't packed! Delicious."}
{"text":"Love this little, local barbecue joint for good, reasonable barbecue!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place as it is around the corner from our home.  However we arrived at 5:25 pm on a Wed evening and there was  hardly anyone there. We ordered ribs...they were out of them. They recommended the brisket but it would be at least 20 min before it was ready. We explained we were on a time crunch so we ordered a hamburger and meatloaf. 30 min later still no food.  Now the brisket is done and they have just put my hamburger on to cook. REALLY??? We had explained to our server we were in a time crunch and settling for a hamburger since the cook had told the server \"the brisket will be done when it is done\".  We left after no food and 40 minutes and went elsewhere for dinner. Unless you have several hours for the meal...don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place has made huge strides. A year ago it was mediocre at best buy the new owners have cleaned up. I love the ribs, by the pulled pork is also excellent. 
The brisket is good too but I prefer a nice thick cut, fatty, dry rub brisket (I'm a Texas style man). But they're shredded brisket is great in a sandwich. 

The atmosphere is totally casual and comfortable. Unpretentious and delicious. Much better than Dickey's and I like supporting such a small business"}
{"text":"Had the brisket last night, tasted like thin sliced roast beef with bottled sauce.  Collards good, baked beans good"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ brisket.  We asked for it to be lean and they delivered.   Very nice. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried American BBQ Shack because it had good reviews and 4/5 stars. Boy, was I disappointed. The food was less than mediocre and the service was just the same. I do not recommend this place. There are plenty of other better BBQ places."}
{"text":"This is a great local BBQ place. We ordered the combo which included dessert. Everything was really tasty. It is definitely comfort food. We will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This BBQ place has some good smoked ribs! I ordered a side of Mac and cheese and it was delicious! Loved the beef brisket, it had a some flavor to it. The atmosphere is really nice and friendly! I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"We had good service from the start then we were not checked back in on after getting our meal. When we recieved the check we presented a restaurant.com gift certificate. They told us they would not honor it and told us to contact restaurant.com for a refund. it was funny because they said they use to work with them, the gift card said never expires and then they argued with us for 10 mins until they accepted it. If your going to use a company for advertising don't try to go back on it. For that reason this place put a bad taste in my mouth. I would never go back for that simple fact that they will try to dispute a gift card for there restaurant... I won't waste another minute or dollar at that restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ place in town! The Tri tip and Boss hog are my favorite sandwiches. Valentina, as well as the rest of the staff, are awesome. 

Great beer specials and a solid selection of 4 peaks brews. The restaurant is clean, friendly service, and they even have Russian food available on Saturdays."}
{"text":"We've tried this place twice.... I have no idea how the reviews are soo good because it is terrible... we live right down the street so thought we would give it another shot, the brisket was dry , mac and cheese was bleh collard greens didn't have much flavor.  The best part was the fries and really how can you screw up fried potatoes?  cornbread was also dry.... and pretty blah... I've made better out of a box.  I want to like this place because it is within walking distance and the owner seemed really nice.... but nice doesn't make the food taste better."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery which took an hour and 35 mins to receive.  When the food finally arrived it was totally inedible.

-The ice cream was a melted soup on top of the cookie

-The sandwich and fries were packaged in styrofoam without vents so condescension built up and ran into the food making it wet as well as cold. The bun was so wet it just fell a part.

-I ordered a side salad with ranch and got a caesar salad instead 

When I contacted the restaurant they said I needed to call when a manager was there. The next day they insisted they were on time and refused to refund me. 

Worst of all the receipt in the bag had been printed on the back of a previously used piece of paper that had someone else's information on it. Name, address, phone number, and Mastercard number

I will not be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Food was good, except you better be willing to eat things like mashed potatoes and green beans with your fingers since they do not send any plastic ware or napkins with the order.  My order was delivered by UberEats to a hotel, so it should be known that I don't have anything to eat with.  Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"I just had AZ BBQ for the first time because one of my roommates eats there enough to apparently get his picture put on the wall with the rest of the regulars. Take that for what you will for him personally, but it's just that kind of place which I appreciate. 

I had a hop knot IPA, a tri tip sandwich per recommendation, and green beans. Tri tip was kind of thinly sliced/shredded and well coated with BBQ sauce, and I will pass on that recommendation to you. Green beans were very good as well. They had these thinly sliced pieces of some kind of bacon or cured meat of some sort (if you know what it is let me know). Ambiance and overall experience wasn't anything special but it's a good meal served by good people so I'll be back in a week."}
{"text":"Ordered baby back ribs, baked beans and a salad delivered to my hotel room. It took an hour and 40 minutes for my food to arrive and it was totally cold. If that wasn't bad enough, I received no napkins and no plasticware. On a delivery to a hotel room!  The ribs were OK, but I'm not sure about the taste since they were so cold. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Great ribs, tri-tip not bad either.  8 hungry golfers and everyone was very pleased.  

I highly recommend.  It looks to be family owned and operated.  Friendly service.

Only 5 minutes from Talking Stick Resort."}
{"text":"Great BBQ menu, very reasonable prices and quiet atmosphere.  Will definitely come back !!!"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a new local go-to BBQ spot but unfortunately BBQ shack didn't hit the spot, it almost missed the dart board.
I went for the big meat plate and got their specialty, the brisket. For about $18 it comes with a decent portion of brisket, two big sides, and a small stale cornbread. The brisket was dry...what a let down. The fat in it gave it good taste, but it had no chance because the actual meat itself was dry. I ate it because I was starving, but it was far from memorable. The potato salad was a good mix, and the baked beans were just ok. The cornbread confirmed that someone in the kitchen has bad taste and is ok with serving old nasty cornbread. If cornbread can't be done right how the heck can you make good BBQ?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch and asked the sweetest gal ever what do you recommend , I'm famished...\" TRy the Brisket  she shares , it is the best and sit down honey ,  I will spoil you silly! \" . Absolutely the most delicious barbecue I have ever enjoyed and I'm from the SOUTH! Loved the small town feel, the great great handmade light fixtures - JO JO Gaines would covet this guys work. I'm coming back cause they have fried okra and home made peach cobbler ..oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I want to register on Yelp, to let people know about this place and food I found. I had BOSS-HOG(Friday's special), its like 2 in 1: sliced pork, bbq sauce, melted cheese, and cole  slaw on French roll. Huuuge sandwich for only $7! DELICIOUS!!!   They have all week something special. You should try it."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with a group of friends to have dinner on the Russian food night. Everything was really great, the meatballs and the cabbage rolls were my favorites. If your into dessert you really have to try the big cookie with ice cream and strawberries, it comes straight out of the oven and it really delicious! Prices are very reasonable. I plan to return often!"}
{"text":"I have tried everything on the menu and Pulled pork sandwich is piled high and VERY tasty!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork and brisket were amazing. Shared 1/2lb of each with toast and beans and coleslaw. It was plenty of food for two. You might need to wait a minute but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in during AZ Bike Week. Saturday special....Burnt ends. AMAZING!!!! Beef brisket was great too. Definetly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting AZ and looking for great BBQ we turned, of course, to Yelp. This place showed 4 stars. I rate it 5.

The location is not visible from the road and not a huge dining room. We did take-out. Those dining in when I picked up raved about it as they ate. :)

I fed four adults and three kids - all of them loved it. Baby back ribs are awesome - so tender, falling off the bone - really good sauce - just the right balance of tang, a touch of sweet and a little spice; we did not order the spicy - :(

Cornbread is excellent - moist and had some bell pepper in it. Green beans are perfect with a little bacon flavor. Baked beans and Coleslaw did not disappoint.

The beef ribs were awesome (come as 3 big ribs with a salad). The salad was really good - Feta (I think), cucumber, cherry tomatoes and a nice dressing.

Baked potato was big (not huge - which is fine for the price) and came with all the fixins'.

Family owned, super friendly. I think they have been in business for just over 2 years and hopefully Yelp will keep them going.

We visit Paradise Valley/Scottsdale area 1-2 times a year and this will be one of our \"must have\" meals."}
{"text":"Found the place in the corner of the shopping center on a Saturday dinner. New ownership, and even a Saturday special for burnt ends seemed promising. The pricing is pretty good, and both the place and the food had a lot of heart. Even so, our meal ended up being okay.

Came with a couple bros - one wanted some saucy, tender ribs. With some succulent pictures and their menu focus on their meatier Pork Back Ribs, we figured this fit the bill. And with the Saturday special of burnt ends, this should have been some of the most tender bites of meat ever. And with BBQ, the meat is always the focus.

Pork Back Ribs: the smokiness and dry rub were fantastic, going all the way down to the bone. But our expectations were askew - that Mahogany Glaze felt cooked through to a barky crust. Definitely doesn't match some of the other pictures of ribs on the Yelp page. There is enough flavor you don't need sauce to eat, but of course sauce helps. But the biggest issue was the ribs somehow being moist and tough at the same time. Just a hint above tender, we could bite the meat off the bone but needed a little more effort to chew through the meat. A braise or finish in sauce could have counteracted that, but that's not the AZ BBQ Shack style, and I respect that.

Burnt Ends: I was on board with this Saturday Special from the first minute, perhaps 8 very saucy cubed bites in a cast iron for 1/2 pound. Then I took the first bites. I could not find the marbling I needed for that melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Unlike the ribs' stylistic difference, this was just straight off - they were chewy and hard to eat, just under a giant cube of beef jerky. I don't know if these were true burnt ends or brisket just incinerated to a crisp, but I was just straight up disappointed. Maybe I should've seen it coming on an 2/3 empty Saturday night dinner.

I think the sides largely fit the bill. Mac and Cheese, Cornbread, and the Collard Greens were all good, just a tad bland. We asked if the fries were fried alongside bread crumbs due to a gluten allergy, but our waitress didn't know. We ordered anyways, and it turns out the fries were the frozen kind that are slightly battered. Not gonna detract from the experience since they were delicious, but it seemed like an easy enough question the cook could have answered and sad that our friend who wanted fries couldn't eat them.

I might come back in the area to try their sliders or some of their other meats, but the stars of tonight's dinner largely did not perform. Maybe could go for a lunch special, but would not order meat en masse again based on faith."}
{"text":"Honestly did not know this place existed until I found it on Yelp. Based on the other reviews I figured I would give it a try and was not disappointed. I came here for lunch and ordered the pulled pork and potato salad to go. The portion size was huge and the spicy bbq sauce is the TRUTH. I was more than full and happy after eating here. I will be returning to try their ribs."}
{"text":"So I order a $50 combo to go with Ribs, Brisket, Mac&Cheese, Cornbread, and The dessert cookie!  Not a single customer when I went at 6pm.  Well for starters some napkins would've been nice!  The Brisket and Ribs have absolutely no Smokey flavor whatsoever!  The cornbread was old and reheated in the microwave, the cookie was raw, the Mac and cheese wasn't authentic!  Maybe I'll try some of their Russian food sometime, but at this point highly doubtful.  The BBQ that I had is really a joke, sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue, reasonable prices, great atmosphere! whenever we are in Arizona we always stop by here it's so  good!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this place because very few restaurants deliver to my work and I was getting very sick of Chinese and Subs, so this was a breath of fresh air! The food was good, the service was fast and they delivered, so couldn't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great service and pretty quick. The tri tip sandwich was the highlight! Super soft and flavorful. There are two options for wings: fried chicken wings and smoked wings. The fried wings are split drummettes, while the smokes wings are whole. I loved the trio of bbq sauces but the Carolina vinegar was the best. Definitely will come back. Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Had some food delivered. Unbelievable. I threw most of the food out. The bun for the brisket was all wet from condensation inside the box. The meat was dry and tasted old. I tried eating a little with the BBQ sauce and that helped a little. The mac and cheese was OK. The green beans overcooked. Baked beans were OK. Potato salad was put thru a food processor with small pieces of potato--awful. Never again!!
I almost forgot---the Chinese salad had wilted lettuce and canned oranges. Do people actually eat this stuff????"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fantastic lunch from Arizona BBQ shack this weekend. We made a large order for pickup for our family. On arrival, I was warmly greeted by the wonderful lady working the lunch shift. Our food was hot and ready to go which I was grateful for as everyone was very hungry.

The brisket...The brisket...The brisket. The best I have tried and I have eaten BBQ from Fort Lauderdale's \"Georgia Pig\" to through our great inland states to the West coast. The BBQ brisket was excellent and I highly recommended it.

The family agreed. We also enjoyed the mac and cheese, cole slaw, the pulled pork, the tender tri-tip and other items. No doubt we will be back again and again for another great meal. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed drove a good distance and the pulled chicken was so dry I have to drown it in sauce or it might have chocked me, ugh. Brisket was average and sides average would not come here again."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food was processed. Paid $83 for lunch. Super disappointed for a first time experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We were visiting my stepfather's old neighborhood, and he let us know that this was placed was known for having great barbecue. We were definitely not disappointed. We were able to get a lunch special on a Saturday that we visited, which was $7.50 for three sliders, a side, and a drink. My goodness, their pulled pork was delicious! They also had some different barbecue sauces at the table to try (spicy habanero and bourbon were the most notable of the three), and their fries were delicious. 

This place definitely has a nice mom and pop type of feel, which definitely made everything feel more personable. It did take about 20 minutes for us to get our food, but it was comfortable enough inside and we weren't in any rush. I would highly recommend this place if you're out with the family and looking for a casual place to enjoy some barbecue."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and price is right for lunch.  All the meats are marinated over night and smoked for 6 hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Really cool and clean. Staff is very nice and best part is that they have dollar beers from 7-9 everyday. This is my new local hangout."}
{"text":"Small and plain place -- nothing but excellent BBQ.  Ribs are fantastic; baked beans are outstanding.  Service very nice.  Excellent value and excellent food experience.  Don't miss this restaurant.  Ribs are great without the sauces, but if you want to spice it up, the Spicy sauce will do."}
{"text":"The new ownership was definitely something this place needed. The owner, Michael, knows his BBQ and everything that comes out of the kitchen is stellar. Everything is made with spice and soul, which can be tasted with every bite. The home made sauces are so amazing, especially the sweet BBQ sauce! My family and I always look forward to the weekend because it is now a family tradition! My 1 year old son can't get enough of the brisket! All of the sides are great with the food, including the mashed potatoes and gravy! The beer served there is just icing on the cake with everything else! I strongly recommend stopping by sometime and giving them a try!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Stopped in after the lunch rush.  I sat at the bar and the bartender seemed to be more interested in looking at his computer than any of the 3 customers in the joint.  The BBQ was good but not enough for me to go out of my way to come back again."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood BBQ joint.  We share a full rack of ribs that are delicious and they have beer including 3 different 4peaks brews on tap to choose from."}
{"text":"I come here every few years, (seriously) as it is near the house, but not near where I usually shop. We decided that last time the ribs were great, but relatively expensive for the type of place, so lets grab some food instead of the Mexican food down the way. It appears to have changed ownership. It seems every time we come in here there are new owners? 

Place was clean, but empty. Service was super friendly, but not overly fast and we were the only ones there. The food was good, but the ribs were pretty fatty, which makes them taste better, but still a bit too fatty. The Brisket was not smoked at all. Like another review here, was more like pastrami. It was thin and a little chewy, but was OK, just not great.  The big cookie and ice cream were a nice treat.

The \"Hot\" sauce tastes like they took the mild sauce and added tabasco. I hate tabasco. Totally the wrong flavor for BBQ. I suppose I may try the \"off the menu\" Russian food if I go back. another review suggest making it a Russian restaurant. Probably not a bad idea. Add Czech and Polish food and I'll be there."}
{"text":"tri tip was good but small portion and the potato salad looked great but had a strange sour taste...cheep industrial mayo?"}
{"text":"Go when they have burnt ends, thats amazing. Great brisket, and great pulled chicken. Mac/cheese good too. Def worth stopping by. Good deal for quality BBQ."}
{"text":"After an away game at saguaro high school decided to get something to eat and we ended up at the shack. Very nice surprise, cozy , good music, decent service and food. Very interesting owner, we ask about the lights and he seem very friendly. Sad that is not near my house."}
{"text":"This place actually used to be anywhere between 2 to 3 stars. I stopped going due to inconsistency in food product, service and quality. Anyways, I heard this place had a new owner so decided to give it a try again. Damn. The food there is awesome. The new owner clearly knows how to make some good BBQ. The new staff is super friendly.  Got a pulled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese my sister got the same with fries. The fries are that thicker golden crunchy fries and they were awesome. The mac n cheese was amazing. The chicken is pulled but not shredded. You're getting actual chunks of chicken that has been smoked with a dry rub.The sandwich could be eaten without sauce, but the house bourbon sauce is really good. I've heard that the brisket is awesome and it's smoked for like 10 hours and not dry at all. They also have a great lunch special. I will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"OMG HORRIBLE !!! I normally don't write reviews and maybe we went at the wrong time late lunch Saturday . The food was horrible . The ribs were dry and had no flavor. They were also very fatty. The chicken wings were not your traditional wings. They were the whole wing. Totally under cooked inside and burnt black on the outside. We paid 36.00 and walked out after 2 bites. Worst restaurant ever !! We only tried it because of the great reviews. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I am extremely picky about chicken when I eat out. I had the Pulled chicken sandwich.... It was so good! The place was clean, staff was attentive and personable. I would HIGHLY recommend this place for lunch... Since that's when we did, but it looks like it would be a great place to hang out in the evening as well. Other family members had the bratwurst and the half rack of ribs and they also enjoyed their food as well. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have an update.  I wrote the review immediately after I received a call from their delivery vendor.  There had been a breakdown in communication and they apologized sincerely.  I got off the phone and was not counting on having BBQ.  However, a moment after I finished this review my phone rang and they were at the door.    

The driver apologized sincerely and I could see that he was frazzled.  I took the order inside and found the food was hot and delicious.  Prior to this I had only had their pulled pork sandwich for lunch, which was yummy.  This time I got the combo pack which included a slab of ribs, 1 lb of meat (beef in this case), 2 sides (I chose slaw and beans), and cornbread, and desert.  The ribs were the best restaurant ribs I have ever had, hands down!!! Meaty, Meaty, Meaty!  Better than what I have tried in Memphis and as good as my beloved KC Style ribs.  Also, I am not a big beef brisket fan but OMG!  The smoke ring was deep and flavorful!  We saved some added it to our omelet in the morning.  The desert was a cookie, at least 8 inches in diameter with ice cream to go on top.  The slaw was good and the beans included multiple varieties had good flavor.

At the end of the day, there was a delivery screw up.  I wrote my first review as soon as I got off the phone with the delivery vendor.  However, Stuff happens!  They owned it, came through with a great meal.  What happened, happened and I will give them another chance in the future because they owned it."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night the family got an itching for some barbeque.  I happened to be in Scottsdale, so I went on my phone and found the Arizona BBQ shack.  The restaurant itself is no frills.  The aroma of barbeque is alive and well here.  I was somewhat concerned that we were the only ones in the restaurant.  However, this concern was unfounded.

My son was hungry, so we got him an order of fries and Caesar salad.  The salad was large, even for me.  It tasted great with slivers of parmigina cheese and dressing.  A first rate salad at a barbeque joint, what is not to like.

My wife and I had  1/2 lb. of brisket and chicken.  The brisket was near perfection; the chicken was good, but dry (my only negative remark of the night).  The sauces are on the table and range from basic to Carolina vinegar to hot and spicy.  We also ordered coleslaw and potato salad.  My only misgiving was that rolls were not included.

The food arrived quickly and the service was good.  The prices are affordable.
I highly recommend this spot for some good barbeque."}
{"text":"Although there has been a BBQ restaurant at this location for some time, the new owners have kicked it up several notches from what it has been in the past. We have now been here three times plus a take out. The Bar-B-Que and everything else is excellent.

Pluses: Brisket is juicy and very tender, Mac and Cheese hits the spot. The beans are as good as it gets. We got there early on a Saturday, just in time to get the next to last order of burnt ends, a regular Saturday feature that should not be missed.

Negatives - If I can think of one I will come back and edit this review.

Comment - This restaurant is a small family owned establishment that deserves to be supported. It is not a big chain or large (well financed) restaurant. As such there can be some hiccups. But the food is excellent, the food server/waitress/bartender/busser is friendly. When it is crowded, I can imagine the service could be slow. However, the food is well worth any minor issues that may arise.

Enjoy!!
Feb. 2 Update: If you live locally I would urge you to try their food on a take out basis. Take out is a large part of their business and Bar-b-Que carries well. -- DDL"}
{"text":"We just ordered the $87 combo meal for a birthday get together and it was fantastic!!! The meat on the ribs just fell off the bones. Mac n cheese, baked beans, and coleslaw were great! The cornbread and dessert was great too. The pulled chicken and pulled pork and all sauces had fabulous flavor. We are all from Kansas City, the home of BBQ, and we are thrilled to find a great BBQ place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"BBQ is back! This place was always a fave, and with the ownership changes, we just gave up. But now, our long desert of waiting for hole-in-the-wall BBQ is over. We needed a place in SoSco to grab a quick bite and had noticed the change in ownership, again, and after seeing positive reviews, we went for it. It was fabulous!!! I had the burnt brisket ends with mashed potatoes and gravy. Hubs had brisket with baked beans and fries. Our teen had a hamburger and fries. All tender and juicy and all kinds of BBQ wonderful. They make their own lemonade. Decor is casual but updated. We may get back to our weekly habit!"}
{"text":"I am very happy to say that the owner reached out to me personally to apologize about the service and the food and refunded by money."}
{"text":"So, I'm writing this review after having just inhaled 2 pork sliders and some of the best french fries I think I've ever eaten.  Just wanted to set up the scene for you.

First, to begin my story, I have been to this little out of the way restaurant several times over the past 8 years hoping against hope that I could find a new BBQ place to frequent for ribs, brisket and deliciousness.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case up until this point.
Fast forward to today.

I had remembered seeing recently that they were bought out and after checking on the newest amazeballs reviews on Yelp I decided to take my appetite for a bacon burger to Arizona BBQ Shack to give them yet another try.
Did I mention that I freakin love BBQ?
I was the only one as I walked in and was immediately greeted by someone behind the bar asking if I had been in before.  I told the same story I have reiterated several times already, that yes, I come by and check them out whenever they have a new owner so I decided to give them a try today.  I asked if they had a basic burger and was asked if I would like to try the lunch special instead, 2 pork or chicken sliders with one of several choices for sides and a drink.
Why yes, yes I would.  I chose pork and french fries and she sat me down to get my input as to which homemade BBQ sauce I would like.  The Bold Bourbon was amazing, I will not lie.

Within minutes my sliders and french fries were boxed up and I was out the door with my choice of BBQ sauce, a container of ketchup for my fries and a to-go drink.  

The sliders are now a distant memory as I write this review (20 minutes later) and I am seriously contemplating going back and getting an order of the chicken sliders because damn, that was some freaking amazeballs BBQ I just ate.

I will be letting my husband know that BBQ may be a regular dinner item that I will be bringing home during the week.  Can't wait to try their ribs, their brats and their brisket.  Oh, and everything else on their menu.  Don't walk, run to this place NOW! EAT ALL THE BBQ!"}
{"text":"Supposed to be a BBQ joint but the best thing in the place is the off menu Russian food.
Perhaps the worst thing you can say about a BBQ place is \"get the pirogi\".

The BBQ is dry and stringy, especially after they reheat it in the microwave.  They should bag the BBQ and just turn it into a Russian restaurant."}
{"text":"I rarely give bad ratings but I feel this place deserves it. I ordered the Mac n Cheese to go along with the brisket. The brisket was mediocre at best. It came out half cold as well. The Mac n Cheese was undoubtedly Kraft Mac n Cheese or something of the like. It was a very uninspiring experience and I felt ripped off that I spent my money here as I walked out."}
{"text":"This is a nice hidden treasure tucked away in the corner of this shipping plaza. Found it completely by accident when the restaurant we wanted was closed. This place ended up being a great rebound. 

The decor is very rustic and Western. Wood tables and a bar. They had some out door seating as well. The food was to die for. I had some pork sliders with Mac and cheese for a side. Other people in my party ordered the brisket and fries. 100 percent comfort food. To slide it all down, they have some house made BBQ sauces to use. My favorites were the spicy and the bourbon. I believe they sell the sauce by the jar too.

Prices were okay.  A little higher but you're playing for quality. I ordered my sliders from their lunch special for the day.  Service was a little slower, but this isn't a fast kind of joint. You come here to talk and enjoy yourselves. Will be back for all my BBQ cravings. Eat local, eat here."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! Big portions! I had the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and it as yummy. I went in the late afternoon so, they weren't busy at the time. I sat at the bar and the young man working did an incredible job. I've eaten at several BBQ places around town over the years and this is still my favorite."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and decent pricing but the pork was really dry and over cooked and my hot link was waaaaay over cooked.  We got our food first thing when they opened and it seems as if we got reheated leftovers from the day before.  Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I took my dog there yesterday, a Saturday on a holiday weekend, there were 3 people in the restaurant waiting for their TAKE OUT order. My dog and I sat/waited on the outside patio for 5 minutes and no one came out.  We were the ONLY ones there, the employee (a girl with long dark hair) saw us and even heard me when I popped my head in asking what do to since I had my dog. She did not come so I assume they have enough business and didn't need ours, so we took our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brilliant pork ribs plain and simple. This place is in a shopping center that you could easily miss. I asked the bartender what was good he suggested a 1/2 rack of pork ribs. I added the coleslaw and corn bread. The spicy sauce was divine- if you do not like spicy this sauce is not for the faint of heart. I happen to like my sauce with a kick. The coleslaw was very good the cabbage was crunchy and its dressed very nicely. My only complaint was the cornbread. It had pimento in it not a big fan - personal taste. Other than that the price was very reasonable. Support this place its rare to find a good barbque place what is good and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Love it! Large portions, and they are awesome for \"to-go\" food... instead of putting the meat, BBQ sauce and bun all together, they separate it out in individual containers within the to go box, so it does not get soggy before we can get it back to the office to eat. And the guy working when I go to pick up the food is SUPER NICE. Younger guy - maybe mid/late 20's. Very nice man!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. My husband and I both got the slider special (me chicken, him pork). Flavor was ok, but I didn't like the big bone I found in my chicken. Mac n cheese was nothing to write home about. Cornbread had a good flavor.  My son's chicken tenders probably were the tastiest thing we ordered, which probably shouldn't be the case for a bbq place."}
{"text":"New ownership! We ordered takeout last week and the food was BOMB.com. The baked beans and green beans were better than most BBQ places I've been to, and their house sauces really topped everything nicely. Our tri-tip and brisket BBQ was unfortunately cold by the time we got home, but we'll be back for sure because it was good even not being at proper temp. 

The cafe itself has been renovated with nice Edison lights and metal artwork. They also just installed a bar. 

I hope good things come for this rejuvenated business!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have great food and service . I love them beer called \"Four Peaks\"! All food are just delicious ! And also ,do you know they have a Russian style food? OMG ! You must try it !!! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"First time here for a meal, and it was awesome!  We stopped by a week ago when we were at the mall, the owner gave us some samples of his brisket and pulled pork, yum! He smokes all of his meats onsite.  Our dinner was a pulled pork sandwich and beef brisket sandwich with a side of some of the best fries ever. Sandwich's? Awesome, meat was perfect, meat melts in your mouth, great home made sauces on the side.  Haley the server was great, very friendly and knows the menu well.  A must try!!"}
{"text":"This business has been though a couple of owners and names. The current situation is much better than under previous owners. 

Three of us ate there on a Sat night (2nd time for 2 of us) and the food was well-prepared, fresh, and tasty. I highly recommend the brisket. My companions had chicken and pulled pork that they liked very much. Our side dishes--mac & cheese and caesar salad--were generously sized and very good. The baked beans needed a bit more baking. The large cookie desert (formerly the pizza cookie) was fresh out of the oven and topped with 3 scoops of ice cream.

The interior has been completely redone and much is cleaner and pleasant than in previous incarnations. The service was friendly, and they switched on the unfortunate ASU-Stanford game for us.We had soft drinks but they do serve beer & wine.

I'd say give the new place a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing fast delivery right to our hotel. A what a huge spread of food for a decent price!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting visit.  The owner, I assume, this foreign speaking lady, was super helpful and seemed devoted to our happiness. We ordered wings and she recommended the smoked wings and they were SUPER good. They were huge and juice, like fresh chicken juice. You know most wings are frozen in a bag and we all adapt to that dry fried meat. This was simply the best chicken I have ever eaten. As far as wings go. They have BBQ and lots of neat items on the menu. DJ on weekends gets the place rocking. A real unique experience. Wil be back."}
{"text":"Don't forget the SAUCE! 

My girlfriend and myself were looking to try a NEW BBQ spot and we chose this establishment because Little Miss BBQ was closed. We ordered a rack of ribs, 1lb. of brisket, two sides which were baked beans and potato salad, cornbread and a pizookie style chocolate chip cookie served a la mode! 
The ribs were tender and fell off the bone. The brisket was cut thin almost like bacon but it was delicious none the less. The sides were very tasty especially the baked beans! Cornbread had pieces of corn inside which made the bread a two thumbs up for me! Cookie was ! Hard to mess that up! 

Only complaint........... NO SAUCE for the BBQ was included, even though they asked us Mild or Spicy! 

So for that they receive a 3 Star rating. 
Be adventurous and try this shack out for BBQ just remember to grab the sauce."}
{"text":"We ordered the ribs, brats and hot links. Our sides were the baked beans and mac and cheese with corn bread. The ribs were meaty and tasty but the links were over cooked. The sides were good but the corn bread was very dry. The service was terrible. It took almost a hour to get out food. Bad experience-try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Literally just finished eating the tri tip sandwich. Must say it was quite delicious. I went with the spicy bbq sauce which had a great flavor and wasn't overly spicy. I am definitely going to be back to try some more of the menu.

Not a 5 star simply because of the ambiance of the restaurant. Food was really good though so I'd recommend checking it out. Compared to the other bbq I've had in AZ this was great."}
{"text":"Food was a good.  My husband and I ordered some $30 combo that had ribs, brisket, potato salad, fries and a large cookie with ice cream.  We came here because we had a coupon from the Entertainment Book.  They would not honor it as they said they no longer accept it.

This is a fairly new 2015 Entertainment book, so they should work with that place to get their coupon removed.  I was upset by it, but my husband said to let it go.

Service was fine, though.  We were the only ones there for a late lunch.  We'll probably be back and next time we'll call and verify that the restaurant or whatever place will continue to take the Entertainment coupons."}
{"text":"Been through a couple name changes since we moved to the neighborhood, but food quality has remained above average and a great value in Scottsdale. My favorite brisket in PHX."}
{"text":"New ownership! 

That is what this little local BBQ dive needed. Super friendly, great service, new sauces, revamped sides and great classic BBQ. Brisket is on point!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan of Arizona BBQ Shack. I have been going in there for several years, I'm on ther third owner.  I go in there about once or twice a month for lunch.  Scottsdale is a snooty city (they call it Snobsdale), so it's good to find a decent BBQ joint there.  The restaurant is open, bright and clean.  The food service is courteous and prompt.

I usually get the pulled pork or the tri-tip sandwich with a side of baked beans or red beans and rice.  My vegetarian friend usually gets a salad and corn bread.   Both the pork and tri-tip are genuinely smoked and finished off in the kitchen.  The sandwich and side fills me up.  The pork is usually juicy and tender and the tri-tip is smoked goodness.  My friend's salad is a normal size,  The corn bread portion is large and it is sweet and fluffy.   

The prices keep inching up with each new owner.  But, this is not one of those over-priced high-end restaurants typical of Scottsdale.  It's like a hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint.  In fact, it is tucked in a hole in the wall in the back corner of the strip mall at Granite Reef and McDonald.  

Good BBQ, decent prices, good service."}
{"text":"Arizona barbecue shack!!

Hey lets start with cleanliness: 5 of 5 stars. Floors were spotless, no food under the tables and the restrooms were clean. I haven't been here in a while and noticed they renovated the restrooms, look nice.

The restaurant is not large but its about Pub-size and can accommodate small groups.  It was dinner time and there wasn't a soul around. This didn't discourage me because I've been here before and know the food is good.

I ordered the brisket sandwich, onion rings and drink. Total damage was $14.67 out the door. Upon opening the container I saw six onion rings on the tray and a ranch dressing container. The onion rings were amazing, crispy and cooked to perfection, just wish i ordered two....

The sandwich is just brisket in a cup and the buns. The meat was a little dry but overall it was a good sandwich. I ordered the spicy  bbq sauce and it had the right amount of kick to it. Overall this meal is a solid 4 of 5 stars and would reccomend it."}
{"text":"We ordered to go and asked for a rack of ribs and a 1/2 rack. They were supposed to put spicy sauce on the full rack and mild on the half. The rack had the sauce on the side and the 1/2 had sauce on it. They were completely different types of meat, the 1/2 rack the meat was tender and stringy but the full rack you couldn't get the meat off even with a knife. They just seemed as if they were boiled, not even grilled to try and help with the layer of fat on them. Couldn't even eat them, threw them away and went to bed hungry!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighborhood my whole life.  I have been into this place with every new owner.  However, the owner of the place now has absolutely taken it to a whole new lever.  Soooooo good!  Wow!  Everything I have had has been amazing but the gumbo I had tonight was the best gumbo I have ever had...ANYWHERE!  So, so amazing.  Prices are awesome and the staff is awesome.  I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is by far the most delectable BBQ I've had the pleasure to enjoy in a long long time. It melts in your mouth. The service is wonderful and the atmosphere is pleasant. If you were looking for a place to go, this is it. The cornbread is to die for and the desert cookie was so much fun!"}
{"text":"The people who work at Arizona BBQ Shack are some of the nicest people I have ever met since I have been in Arizona. The cook if proficient in preparing Items on the menu and presentation of the food is beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised at the serving portions sizes. A more than ample amount of food is delivered in each portion. The taste of the barbeque has only been surpassed by the barbeque the my late step-father in Texas made. But he is \"late\" and they fill his vacancy quite well. Another interesting surprise on my first visit. They serve Russian cuisine. I was married to a Russian doctor for four a half years and I did acquire a liking for that, yes indeed. I love eating there and I love their food. I like it is an under statement."}
{"text":"Yum! Great heat, loved the beans and rice, green beans and roast beef. Ribs ok as well as cornbread. Humongous cookies were a hit with the kids. Easy take out, friendly service!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, I'v had the pulled pork, tri-tip and the ribs. The food, as well as the service, is great. Never very crowded, so get the word out - great local business to support!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Arizona everything from the meat to the sauce and the sides if you haven't been here get here and have some amazing food at a great price"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for lunch because I had tried it last week and loved the tri tip that I got. Today I was very disappointed. First of all it took 40 minutes for our lunch. This food is already cooked so I don't understand why it took so long. And then I got the pulled chicken and it was super dry. I doubt I will return"}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Low key atmosphere.  I need to go again and try something else.  Had the brisket sandwich.  It was a bit pricey, hence not the full 5 start.  Oddly, for $10 it didn't come with a single side.  I think that it should at that price point.  

Nonetheless, the sandwich was killer.  I didn't even use sauce on most of it because it was so tasty and moist.  My girlfriend had the lunch special which was a good way to go.  It was 2 sliders and a side for $7.50.  The fries were very good.

I will surely be back for my BBQ fix when I need it.  We love The Thumb and Bryans too, but this was just as good as any if not a smidge better!!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, the delivery was terrible. Took 40 minutes after they said it would be 15-20 & the prices were a LOT higher than quoted on the website. Also it's $6 for delivery which they don't mention on the website. Food was actually good though. So, if you can't get to anywhere else, at least go pick the food up so you don't have to wait forever and you'll know what it costs."}
{"text":"The service is a bit disorganized , for example having to ask for straws and no towels in the restroom. The ambiance is somewhat rundown and feels oddly desperate. But the smoked wings are really really good. The coleslaw and Caesar salad are way better than most. The brisket was more like pastrami but it was good pastrami.  On Sat they also offer Russian food. Borscht  and wings, that I could live with."}
{"text":"This is some of the best barbecue I've ever had since I moved to the valley 1969 highly recommend. My favorite is the beef brisket and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Omg so surprised how delicious their BBQ is. I am from Texas and this is the best I have had in phoenix. Beef brisket was my choice. The bourbon BBQ sauce is divine."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best places around.  The food is delicious and fresh.  The people working there are super friendly and nice.  The mac and cheese is the best I have ever had.  We go here a few times a month.  If you want good food and service by all means visit this place."}
{"text":"Giving this place three stars is a stretch. Stopped by after seeing the great reviews.I should have figured when I arrived at 6 p.m. on a Tuesday the only customer was drinking at the bar and not eating. I should have moved along. I ordered to go the two meat with brisket and sausage. Brisket reminded me of ordering Arby's roast beef sandwich. No BBQ I've ever been to sliced beef so thin. May have made an average Italian Beef sandwich.  The sausage was the second meat and very unremarkable. I had choice of Brat or Hot link, hot link was what I picked and seemed to me to be right out of Johnson's hot link package. Corn bread was pretty good. Macaroni and cheese as well as the coleslaw were meh. I might try this place again to see how their ribs and pulled pork are but my feeling is this place is to be avoided. The spicy BBQ sauce was good, maybe bottled. I asked the gal behind the counter how long they had been there as I drive the 101 every day and she said \"the business has been here 8 years.\" End of conservation. Not a welcoming place for sure  The more I think about it the less likely I'm to go back. My meal was  20 bucks with tax. I'm a big BBQ fan and there's likely a good reason I never heard of this place. As a matter of fact I'm moving them to 2 stars the more I think about it."}
{"text":"Delicious food and impeccably friendly service. We took our three children; 7, 10, and 13.. who are usually picky eaters and all of them cleaned their plates. I ordered the  tri-tip which was so tender and yummy, sauce isn't needed, but they do offer different great tasting sauces. My husband liked the bourbon sauce. We just moved from South Carolina and slaw is usually the first thing I want to try and Arizona BBQ Shacks slaw is on point! We will return.."}
{"text":"My buddy brought me here first time and I had the Saturday special burnt ends and it was by far the BEST I've ever had! This place is a hidden gem. If you like BBQ Try this place!!"}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I've found so far in Phoenix. Tried the sliders- chicken and pork- and a sample of the brisket. There were 3 kinds of sauces when I was there- sweet, bourbon and spicy, but honestly they are not needed. The service was truly outstanding and the price was well worth it. I'll be back frequently!!!!"}
{"text":"New ownership. Changed decor and lighting, built a new bar with full liquor licence and the food is really really good.
Great dry rubs and deep smoke on the brisket and pulled pork. Milder rubs and smoke on the chicken and ribs.  All sides fresh house made.
This is BBQ done right!"}
{"text":"This place just changed my life right now. If I knew how good the food was gonna be, I would have given more money.

Ordered delivery from yelp. Got the $30 combo dinner that comes with 1/2 rack ribs, 1/2 lb meat, two sides, cornbread and dessert.

Delivery was on time and the food was delicious. The ribs fell off the bone and were more mostly meat than fat. Brisket was thinly sliced and had a good smoke flavor. The BBQ sauce was the slightest bit spicy and not too tangy. Mac n cheese tasted homemade and not super processed. Southwest beans n rice were very good as well. Cornbread came with honey! My dessert was a giant hot chocolate chip cookie WITH chocolate chip icecream on the side! Enough food to feed 2-3 people for sure.

This place exceeded my expectations and I will definitely order again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. 
BUT the wait was ridiculous. We arrived about 5:40, and were only the second party in the restaurant.  Our drink order was taken and filled quickly, but the waitress waited another 20 minutes to take our dinner order. By that time, more parties came in.  The people who came in after us ordered, got their food, ate it, paid and left before our food arrived. We assumed it was because they ordered only sandwiches vs our full dinners. Our dinners did not come out until 7:00.  We did complain to the waitress about the wait,and she told us (like it was a matter of course) that there is only one guy in the kitchen doing all the orders. 
Maybe (if we go again...) we'll order take-out. Those orders seemed to arrive more timely than anyone in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great bbq joint that i will be coming for more. The prices are reasonable, and service is bueno. They also have russian style raviolli (pelmeni) which they sell and cook for less money than other eastern european stores/restaraunts."}
{"text":"Came all the way here to find they don't honor their advertise hours of operation...BOO!!!!!!! It's 1105am and im still hete 1119am on a tuesday.
What a waste of time, car millage and gas.  Big banner says \"new owners\" blah blah...well you got to step up and do it right!!!  Right now i see 3 customers sitting on curb twittering their thumbs waiting to spend hard earned money here. I'm leavimg...can't waste my lunch time any more...boo!!!! Besides, if they did open right now how prepared for the day would the bbq be? I dont want last second prep cold bbq."}
{"text":"Key words:  secret Russian menu.  Pierogi, vareniki, $4 hop knots, borsct, bratwurst."}
{"text":"Few of the favorites are the brisket, ribs and chicken wings! Friendly staff and food is always great."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of delicious bbq tucked away in a shopping center. Omg the brisket. I could wax poetic for hours on this moist, delicious, barky brisket!! Oh and by the way, they make the bbq sauces in house. And they are delicious!!!! This place is totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had family in town and they really wanted Ribs so I looked up BBQ places on yelp and came across this little place. It was VERY good and it was very affordable!! Everyone loved there meals! We were actually the only ones that were in there so we were a little skeptical at first but so good! The service was pretty slow and they don't check with you as often as they should but the server was super sweet. They also have a DJ that will play fun songs for you while you eat! I would go back or get catering for a function!"}
{"text":"Given some of the reviews, I had high expectations for AZ BBQ Shack. I arrived for a late lunch and so didn't think it was remarkable that the restaurant was empty. My server was friendly enough, but not very attentive. At his suggestion I ordered the Tri Tip Sirloin sandwich. My food came fairly quickly, and was hot. It was served plain, just a sandwich on a bun on a plate with no garnish at all. The meat was sauced already and was very salty. The flavor was ok at first, but eventually the salt was just too much and I had to give it up. My server never returned to see how my food tasted, or to see if I wanted anything additional. I finally had to go ask him for my check after sitting there for some time. I'm not tempted to try this again."}
{"text":"I will first say that the food we had was fairly good. The order consisted of shredded pork, shredded chicken, mac n cheese, fries, and onion rings. 

However, I must submit a one star review due to the company's unprofessionalism and tardiness in delivering our catering order. We work for a large bank and had planned a lunch function for our group. I asked that our order be delivered at 11:45pm today. In anticipation of this lunch, many people had foregone breakfast and by noon were getting restless. Hoping this 15 minute delay wouldn't stretch out much longer, I called Arizona BBQ Shack and spoke with Valentina (the woman who originally took our order 5 days prior) to check on the status of the delivery. Well, it was soon apparent that she had completely forgotten about our catering order. She assured me they would arrive with it in 15 minutes. 

I wasn't convinced this would happen and of course my instincts were correct. 

Our delivery didn't arrive until almost 12:45pm- AN ENTIRE HOUR LATE. We were given a small discount and free delivery, but this was of little consolation. Many of our people had meetings scheduled around this lunch and our intention to eat together as a team and engage in team building exercises was completely ruined due to this company's extreme lateness. Unfortunately they are unreliable and we would not recommend this establishment for catering if timeliness is a concern."}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ spot! They have three great BBQ sauces and the corn bread and mashed potatoes are amazing better than homemade dish!"}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant it seemed very clean and quiet. I was surprised that there were not more customers (we had the restaurant all to ourselves) given it was a Sunday afternoon. The waitress came over immediately to take our drink order and was very pleasant. 

I wasn't too hungry so I decided to order the chicken nuggets (waitress said they were homemade) with the mac n cheese and baked beans. My husband made a smarter choice and ordered the pulled pork, also the mac n cheese, and green beans. The food came out pretty fast, maybe a little too fast in my opinion. 

Honestly, I was not impressed whatsoever. Although my husband really enjoyed his sandwich along with his sides, I did not. The mac n cheese was prepared with processed cheese sauce (maybe Velveeta) and the nuggets reminded me of Mc Donald's. I'm sure lots of people (like my husband-he ate most of mine in addition to his :)) enjoy food prepared like this, but me not so much. It may be even that my expectations were too high. The tastiest side dish I ordered was the baked beans which did seem homemade.

Perhaps I made poor food choices this time, but not sure I'll chance it and go back."}
