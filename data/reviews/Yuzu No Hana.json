{"text":"As a long time frequent customer of Japango, I decided to give their sister restaurant Yuzu No Hana a try.  First thing I noticed was the difference in atmosphere.  The lighting was dim and the dining room had a modern Japanese look to it.  The music was loud enough that you would have to speak up to have a conversation with the rest of the table (understandable since it was also a sake bar) but not unbearable.  The service was standard, nothing stood out in particular

As for food, I tried a california roll, spicy salmon roll and a chirashi don.  For all three dishes i found the rice to be a bit too hard and could have been made a bit softer.  The california roll had an equal proportion of crab meat and avocado which is nice but i do generally prefer a larger proportion of avocado in my california rolls.  The spicy salmon roll, not saucy making it a bit dryer than other places and gave a delayed kick of spice.  The amount salmon in the roll was less than I expected and in my opinion they could have added more to it.  The chirashi don was great.  It had a more than fair portion of sashimi.  There were 3 pieces of each fish and about 6 different types and on top of that a giant scallop on the rice as well.  The fish was extremely fresh as expected and sushi rice with seasoning was used instead of plain rice.  Definitely a well made chirashi don.  

Overall, Yuzu No Hana was good but not amazing.  In my opinion Japango makes much better rolls, an equally pleasing chirashi, and offers more economic options so I would definitely prefer Japango over Yuzu. 

P.S. If you order a Yuzu roll (their signature roll), its literally on fire. (They lit a bit of alcohol on the plate on fire)  Bonus points for creativity there."}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi and sashimi and great Sake selection.  Great quality for the price."}
{"text":"Yuzu is my favourite mid to high-end Sushi spot in Ontario. In terms of quality, ambience and service; this is the place to go.

Every time I've gone, I've sat on the sushi bar and had the head chef serve me whatever he felt was in season or was the best catch that day. They have some of the best Japanese imported fish, bluefin tuna, wagyu, and other local seafood. 

One of the biggest factors for exceptional sushi is getting the temperature at a perfect state. Optimal sushi rice should be around body temperature and the fish should be near room temperature. 

The head chef is always friendly, engages in conversation and educates you throughout the meal. Sometimes you get caught up and end up having a 15+ course meal with 'exotic' imports and that could really dent your pockets (ie. A single order of wagyu or toro is about 30$ each)...BUT IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. 

Plus, if he likes you, he hooks you up with a couple freebies .

Ps. Their sake cheesecake is crack!"}
{"text":"Uni was super fresh the night we went, and desserts were spot on. Overall really enjoyed the atmosphere and food was good."}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi was very fresh.  appetizers are interesting and unique and definitely worth trying.  loved the yuzu roll...a bit pricey but very tasty.  no soya sauce or wasabi needed for that one.  try the green tea creme brulee as well!  better for a date than for groups as the dishes are more or less for individuals.  One thing I have to complain about though is that we brought an ice cream cake to the restaurant for a birthday which I requested specifically to put into the freezer (repeated two or three times).  However, when we took it home (instead of eating at the restaurant because we were full) it was basically completely melted indicating they did not put it even in the fridge.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went to Yuzu with my wife and son. We all had Chef's selection. Was not cheap, but it was worth every penny. The waiters were great. Overall, great experience and definitely recommend to anyone who want to eat at a great Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"We ordered the 7-course dinner and everything was amazing. Even my boyfriend, who is a tad afraid of sushi, loved all the food and made him into a japanese food fan. The clam soup was a stand out dish. The prices were good for the quality of the fish, which is the most important thing! I was worried about how empty the place was and the neighbourhood is quiet after dark, being on the fringe of financial district...I hope this place stays in business!  

The sake menu was almost overwhelming, but the server helped us make some informed decisions."}
{"text":"don't like the waiters' attitudes. Their serving speed is so slow i didn't feel like i have eaten anything. and the food was not that good, it was among average. not worth booking an reservation at all."}
{"text":"Authentic with a nuance. Great ambience, very warm service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Yuzu is definitely NOT your typical sushi joint! It's somewhat more expensive than the other sushi restaurant where the quality and variety is higher. I've tried many Sushi places in the GTA, and I would say this is the best restaurant in terms of fish quality - it's really fresh, flavourful and is sliced in perfect manner. The entire presentation makes it a very pleasant experience. Yuzu has it all - delicious dishes for those that have delicate palletes; service that makes you feel like royalty; and an ambiance that heightens the whole dining experience! 
It's different from the hundreds of sushi restaurants in the city and if you're prepared to spend over $30 for a meal, give Yuzu a try - it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews on here I thought this place would be THE sushi place in downtown Toronto to go to.  Unfortunately, I was rather underwhelmed by my experience.  The restaurant itself was very nice and the atmosphere was just what I was looking for; calm and casual.  The staff were also helpful and polite.  The disappointment was the food itself, specifically the sushi rolls.  The pieces were so small and the taste was bland.  Perhaps I just ordered wrong or it was an off night but my visit just didn't live up to what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Nicht sonderlich neuwertiges Ambiente, aber seht authentisch. Klasse Sushi und gute Auswahl an Sake. Service war japanisch - reserviert."}
{"text":"Came here with the CTO of the company.. great service, great food, great atmosphere!

The food was absolutely amazing.. and since it was on the company, I cannot complain on the 1600 dollar bill at the end of the meal. (we had a table of 12)

Yuzu is definitely a place to go for a special night out. =)"}
{"text":"What a gem.  Comfortable décor with great attention to detail.  Staff was attentive, friendly and courteous.  The sashimi deluxe was fresh and beautifully presented.  Soku (sic) was the sushi chef and asked my preferences and gave a nice tutorial about what she made.  Best sushi experience in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and they were not ready for us. Menu was confusing, sushi was overpriced for quality. 

Servers / kitchen was slow."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The food was acceptable, but the overall experience was not. Was on an 8 course menu. It felt like there was a time limit and we were getting chased out. Before we finished one round, the next 2 would already be sitting on our table and they would be trying to clear my first plate. For $100+/Person (before drinks), I think I'll pass the next time someone wants to go."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the service is gracious and omakase is simply amazing. But even if you don't go for omakase, there are a few menu options that will get you close.

A very high favorite - one of the best places in TO."}
{"text":"Sooo good.  Overall quality of all the dishes is very high.  The rolls are expensive, but I felt like they were extremely big.filling..is it just me?  I loved the tuna tataki and the eggplant, well I loved everything I ordered including the green tea creme brulee.  I would say that the spicy tuna roll and spicy salmon roll (with the tempura bits on top) had a spicy sauce that was a touch too acidic (however, thankfully, no mayo).  My favorite spicy tuna roll is from Tokyo Sushi on St.Joseph Street.

Overall, I think this could be my favorite Toronto sushi place!  Yes, it is expensive, but it is still think it is cheaper and much better quality than other \"high end\" sushi places ahem Ki, Asuka."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Excellent gyoza.  Beautiful setting.  It was a random choice that turned into a great find"}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi tasted smoked for some reason, and the fish didn't taste particularly fresh. Overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"FOOD:
My husband and I started with the gyoza and the avocado salmon tartare. Both were just okay. I prefer my gyoza a bit crispier and the salmon tartare was lacking in flavour. 

For main entrée, I ordered the sushi deluxe and the nigiri was delicious. The maki that came was a bit lacking though. I prefer my maki not to have tempura flakes and the maki in my order was covered in them; took away from the presentation as I couldn't see what was in the maki as well as the flavour.

SERVICE:
Just above terrible. Maybe they were short staffed on a Saturday evening but I found the wait staff to be very slow and unfriendly. It was 20 minutes after being seated for anyone to come greet us and take our order. My entrée came first (the sushi deluxe) and my husband's order (bento box) didn't arrive until 10 minutes later. Nobody checked in on us after we got our entrées either (I've been a server and this should be standard).

I was also watching a table in front of me (party of 10) and the horrible service they received. No body had taken their drink/food order for about 30 minutes and when someone asked if someone could take their order, the waiter said something about nobody telling them that they were ready to which the customer replied why they would have to do that, a server should be checking in with them."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with co-workers and ordered the sushi lunch (sushi & nagiri) and gyoza to start. The gyoza was divine! The filling was delicate and delicious, the dough was the perfect thickness. The sushi was good and presented beautifully but nothing to rave about. Also the service was spotty; while every waitresses was very friendly, our food arrived at various times and half our group finished their lunch before the other even received theirs."}
{"text":"The sashimi is the freshest I've had in Toronto thusfar! And this is coming from someone from the west coast where sushi is always good anywhere you go. Plating was great! And the lychee cocktail (forgot the name of the drink) was delicious! 
One thing I didn't like was that they closed at 11pm on a Friday night, so they were kind of rushing us out at the end..... who closes at 11pm on a weekend in downtown Toronto?!?!

I would come back again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Very poor service! Lied about a reservation and wanted to argue that she wasn't lying. Another waitress missed our order and also lied and didn't not admit to it until confronted. Food was okay but if you expect service, don't come here. Water was never filled during entire dinner..."}
{"text":"One of my fav. Sushi places. Had chefs choice sushi plate, and black sesame ice cream. Definitely go again"}
{"text":"Came here for the $18 summerlicious lunch and it was well worth it! Even though the place was busy the food arrived quickly and was delectable. I chose chirashi for my main - tasty and fresh sashimi on proper sushi rice and not too heavy."}
{"text":"Been here for both lunch and dinner. Every visit I've had the pleasure f enjoying fresh sushi and sashimi. If you visit this place, try out their unagi."}
{"text":"Firstly, I need to say: sushi purists need not apply - Yuzu is not that kind of place. What you will find are delicious creations, raw and cooked, that are beautifully presented. Most importantly, the fish is fresh and the rice is consistently solid (with an occasional blip here and there).

Every time I go (which is often), I am always happy to be sitting at the bar, talking to the chefs, and eating some really tasty sushi. Tonight's hand roll was especially lovely; the nori was delicate and crunchy, and the texture of spicy tuna, shrimp, and avocado makes me want to eat another one right now.

Other favourites include the salmon belly, seared madai, the chawanmushi, and their oyster and uni shooters (something every Yuzu/Japango initiate should try).

I'm currently at 173 photos from Yuzu... and counting."}
{"text":"Somebody hold me down before my head pops off: I am in Uni ecstasy. I ate the best Uni of my life here. It was served live, and, as any true Uni lover will appreciate, it was the creamiest, smoothest, fresh-from-the-sea, salty deliciousness I have experienced to date. It was so good, I ordered two orders. And I am going back for more. 

I want to grab a megaphone and run down the streets of Toronto shouting the praises of this place but I know that will make me seem nuts. Then again, I watched a dude in a Spidey outfit whiz by on a skateboard on Queen in high traffic..it takes all kinds. 

Hyperbole aside, here is what makes this place worthy of five stars: the service was prompt, polite, and attentive. The seared butter fish was buttery, ditto for the seared tuna sushi, the unagi was tender and perfectly grilled, the spicy salmon roll exceptionally fresh and definitely spicy, and the bluefin toro melted in my mouth (and set my wallet on fire: at this place, you get exactly what you pay for: high quality fish for a high price). The miso soup and edamame appetizers were excellent: the miso soup served piping hot and the edamame was bright green, bursting with freshness. 

Uni lovers: this is the place for you. Penny pinchers: this isn't. 

Expect exceptionally fresh fish, excellent service, and a big bill...that is worth every salty, creamy, perfect moment in this sushi lover haven."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese cuisine. The selection of sushi and sashimi was impressive and incredibly fresh. Although I usually prefer fish over beef. I recommend the beef yakiniku in the bento box which was delicious."}
{"text":"I came on a snowy Saturday evening. Enjoyed fresh sushi, California rolls and spicy salmon crunch rolls -- all very tasty. The candlelit atmosphere and warm service was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I have come here twice. The first time was a 3.5 star experience where the food and service was adequate. The second time, a beef dish gave me diarrhea. I should have known from the off-smell that was radiating from the beef when I chewed it, sigh."}
{"text":"Worth trying, but after comparing with Jabistro, I have to lowered the rating. Because their price range are kinda similar but Jabistro(slightly more expensive) offers more variaties of unusual fish, and they were fresher.

We had tuna tartar and the soybean which were fine.
Deluxe sashimi: I love the king salmon, definitely will go back for that. the butter fish was AWESOME. I've always thought that butter fish are ordinary, but no, with the perfect texture, long last flavor added by green onion oil, it can be outstanding. Oh no, mouth is watering.

Blue fin tuna: I know it's good stuff, fresh, melting in mouth, expensive, but I just love butter fish and king salmon so much better.
-update: after trying a bit more places I realized the reason why I thought it was only okay was because of the quality wasn't as fantastics as it could be at some other places.

Yuzu Maki: fancy looking, fancy tasting, and of course fancy price. Multiple layers completed each other perfectly, a touch of hot sauce, with the fish roe, you just can't stop thinking about the last time it was in your mouth.

Dessert: loved the black seseame ice-cream. Big bowl, not so good looking, but the good taste, good ingredient formed up to be one perfect ending to a dinner that makes you rub your tummy and say oh-my-god.
-update: still recommending, because me and friends highly believe that they made the ice cream themselves versus some other places all have the same tasted black sesame ice-cream which all came from the same store.

Other than that, service was good: prompted, respectful, and helpful.
One big drawback: place is a bit too dark to see the delicate food looooool."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience.  Arrived at reserved time, on a hot August night in Toronto.  Was seated near the kitchen, which was many degrees warmer than the rest of the restaurant.  After trying to tough it out for a few minutes, I got up and asked if I could be  moved to the front part of the restaurant which was much cooler.  \"Sorry, all the tables are reserved.\"  Left and had a very good meal at Japango, instead."}
{"text":"I finally came here in May 2011 with a friend that came and visit me from HK. I knew about this place because I used to go to Japango a lot and the owner of Japango told me he opened another restaurant - Yuzu. 

Food Quality - is excellent. Raw fish was very fresh, presentation of the dishes were so delicate.

Environment - decent size for a downtown restaurant, contemporary renovation. 

At the end of the dinner, the chef recognized us from being his regular customer at Japango. He came and said hi to us and even brought us a nice cocktail for each of us. It was a wonderful night, and we all had a good time, especially an unexpected re-union of old friends.  Too bad I don't quite remember how good the food taste, because I was too busy talking and didn't get to try the food until it was cool off on the table....but I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I was here for my gf's birthday last week and it was amazIng.

The food was awesome. The ingredients were so fresh and the presentation was fantastic. The restaurant was very clean and the ambience was nice cool and cozy. 

Food

Eda mame - cooked perfectly with the right amount of salt

Tuna tartare - sooo fresh and yummy. I dont normally eat tuna but this dish was great

Make and sushi combo - again, the ingredients were so fresh and presentation was beautiful

Cod - the presentation was so nice but the taste was even better!

Creme brulee - the absolute best creme brulee i've had. I would go back just to have this again!

Overall, I think this is one of the better sushi places in the GTA area, I would defintely recommend it, whether it is for a date, dinner with friends or just to grab some quality sushi."}
{"text":"They have some pretty interesting / unique rolls here and the sashimi/sushi is always fresh. Definitely consistent on quality.

If you care about the ambiance, then I suggest staying on the main floor. The 2nd floor they open up when they are busy and let's just say the decor is a bit outdated."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese dining experience!

This is definitely the best Japanese meal I have ever had in this city. I've eaten at many of the 'high-end' Japanese places and for similar prices, this is by far a better value.

Everything just tastes 'extra fresh' and is presented beautifully.  Excellent Sake selection and great service."}
{"text":"I'm a self-admitted sushi snob and having just moved from New York, I was having serious difficulty finding good sushi places in Toronto (What is up with all these AYCE places? No, no, NO.) This place kept popping up along with Japango in searches for \"best Japanese restaurants in downtown Toronto\"and I decided to check it out. It's quickly become my go-to Japanese restaurant (I kid you not, I have been here at least 3 times in as many weeks). The quality for the price is unbelievable. My first time here was on a date night with my bf who had just flown in from NYC. We ordered everything we wanted from the menu, including UNI SUSHI (only $9 for two!), a sushi platter, unagi don, appetizers, drinks, etc. and it only came out to around $70, even though we were stuffed. And let me tell you, Yuzu No Hana is definitely on par with some of the most well-known Japanese restaurants in NYC. I've also been particularly inclined recently to pop by for lunch - They have amazing lunch sets for $15 that I've also got my coworkers hooked on. 

I definitely recommend that you stop by if you're in the area for affordable & satiating Jap food! :)"}
{"text":"Small portions, not small prices but truly yummy. I had the black cod and was very, very happy with it. My buddy's steak looked delicious. The sashimi platter was delicious.

The acoustics are crappy in the restaurant and, initially, I could barely hear my friends over the house music they were playing. I eventually asked them to turn the music down and they actually did. Then apologized to us. Nice. That never happens. Nice! That never happens :-)"}
{"text":"The sushi & sashimi moriawase was prepared to perfection. Knowledgeable, friendly waiting staff and a tasty dinner for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Overall had a pretty disappointing experience with the service. Food was average but I am from Vancouver so quality of Japanese food in Toronto can't be compared.

We ordered the omakase sushi .. on the menu it says \"18 pieces. Chef selection. No substitution\". When it arrived..there were only 17 pieces. We asked the server about it. She counted twice to confirm it is indeed 17 pieces and said it was because uni and ikura are considered premium sushi so they give us one piece less.

I find it pretty ridiculous... The menu says 18 pieces yet that can give us any amount they want? Neverthrless, is it THAT costly for the restaurant to give us that 1 extra piece of sushi? I'd say its false advertising. 

Service was not great either
-water was never filled
-never offered to order drinks when we sat down 
-expected us to make room for the server to put down the food
- didn't even place the plate properly in the right direction

I spoke to the manager and told him I was very disappointed with the service I received  and all he said was \"I am very sorry\" without even asking what went wrong. Unbelievable.

If they position themselves as a higher end Japanese restaurant, as reflected in the price, I am expecting a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Love the sashimi, very fresh.
Sushi is good as well.
The chees cake is not very sweet, nice!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning just before New Year's Eve last year. I got Deluxe Sashimi takeout. I was stupid to eat the fish as it smelled extra fishy and looked a bit sweaty. But I was hungry and didn't have any food in the fridge so I gambled and lost."}
{"text":"Although we ordered the most expensive (chef's choice) meal on the menu, we were rushed through our meal in an aggressive unpleasant way. The dishes that arrived were good but totally standard, not what one expects as a chef's choice. And we would be only half way through a course and they were removing our plates and trying to give us the next one. After complaining three times, finally to the man who sppeared to be the manager,  the service finally slowed down. But by then there was only desert, the black sesame ice cream. A good but not special chef\"s choice. Fiercely aggressive table service, apparently an attempt to seat another group at our table as soon as possible.  I doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"Went there for the Valentine's day. Worst decision ever.

There were only 2 options, $80 or $100 omekase. After we placed our orders once we were seated, the server forgot about our order 3 times and kept coming back asking if we placed our orders. Also had to ask so many times for the tea or water. Didn't give it to us until we refused to eat the super salty food unless they gave us something.

Apparently they had a time limit set for each table (in their mind). The direct result for them forgetting about us initially, is to have all the dishes come all together. The server then kept rushing us to eat and  trying to take the plates away. She even tried to take the dishes away right after she dumped the plates on us, assuming we will be able to finish the food in a glance? 

At one point?the server was aruging vigorously with the manager in korean right between our table and the sushi bar. 

Well, the server successfully kicked us out in 1.5hr including the waiting time. Worst omekase experience ever, if it could be even called omekase at all. It was a chaos. Guys, spend the money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. Cozy and dark and not too busy. I recommend selecting items from the chefs specials of the day. That is defiantly where you will get the freshest and most interesting selection. 
I wouldn't waste my time with the safe dishes. I was disappointed by their soft shell crab and their oysters I felt they were too heavily battered and fried. 
Their pork belly and kimchi dish was killer. Cooked just right. Their sushi rolls are pretty good but nothing special. Except for their signature YUZU flaming roll. That is the only one I recommend. Overall a nice japanese restaurant but in order to get more bang for your buck order from the chefs specials!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch (once every week or two) and can't get enough of their chirashizushi.  The fish is fresh, the rice is flavourful, and the little garnishing touches are creative and fun.  The portion is just right for a lunch.

I also attended this year for their Valentines day omakase, which was an amazing meal. Once again very fresh and creative.

The atmosphere at the restaurant is excellent. Cool music, nice lighting, and a very comfortable sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great place, haven't tasted fish this fresh in awhile. Recommended."}
{"text":"Who is reviewing this place?!!!!?/?!?!  It was HORRIBLE.  Overpriced by far, small portions and the sashimi made me sick all night!!!  And that was just from the first bite because I sent it back as soon as I tasted it.  Then they had the nerve to try to charge me for the dish.  It is literally 3:44am and I'm still up sick (use your imagination here people). We were there at 6:30pm.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great experience! 

The service was friendly, professional, and impressively quick. The food was amazing; our table ordered a number of rolls (crunch, dynamite, spider) as well as dessert (yuzu creme brulee and sake cheesecake). All of the food was beautifully presented, fresh and incredible! 

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I gave this place another chance.  Good news is that you can order sushi pizza off the menu - it is very spicy and tasty.  We also ordered a dragon roll which was good.  and finally, I ordered yellow tail sashimi and it was really good. Bad news is service still leaves something to be desired.  

My friend arrived 15 mins before i did.  When i got to the table, she said she had yet to be \"acknowledged\" yikes.....Then the waitress kept wizzing by but did not stop to ask us if we wanted to order drinks. We had to flag her down with large hand waving motions to get her attention...

FYI...the table next to us ordered the \"chef special\"...the table on the other side of us had turned over customers and we had received our bill as the \"chef special table\" was only on their third course of the night.  Word of advice, don't order the chef special...order a la carte is my advice but only select pieces (toro, yellow tail, butterfish and dragon roll). Will try more a la carte menu items next time. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a philistine when it comes to sushi so, in that context my experience was that:
    * the sushi tasted good but didn't blow me away
    * the standards were quite fresh and well presented
    * there was plenty of selection of fish/roe/shellfish
    * the sake selection is respectable
    * service was perfect
    * atmosphere was exactly what you'd expect at a sushi place (downtempo grooves on the stereo, austere decorations, dark tones)

Overall: a good place for a nice date or business dinner for up to four people."}
{"text":"If you've been turned away at Japango, head over to Yuzu.  It's the sister location that has a much larger dining space.  My love for Japango is now shared with Yuzu.

My usual dishes are the agedashi tofu which is lightly fried then served in a dashi broth.  Yum!  Sushi deluxe has a nice assortment of their special sushi and your standard fare.  BC tuna and butterfish are amazing especially since they use a torch it to give it a nice flavour.  

I've taken colleagues there who are apprehensive to raw fish and everyone has enjoyed it immensely.  Every dish is well presented and is extremly fresh.  If you have the time I recommend the omakase.  It's quite the experience with soups, oysters, sushi, sashimi, salads (it goes on and on).  We took the parents there for Valentine's day and they were blown away with the creativity beyond sushi and sashimi.

For dessert, I recommend black sesame ice cream.  It sounds odd but it is off the hook!!  Caution, might turn your lips black so eat delicately.  I'm not really into sweets or ice cream but I can eat a whole order myself.

This is the only restaurant that I will go to for sushi (besides Japango) in the city.  The staff and sushi master Bruce are very friendly and always attentive.  My hubby and I are regulars there and have our own little set of chopsticks each time we visit.  That alone makes our experience that much more special."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, wonderful presentation, solid service. Overall a great experience. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good sushi at Yuzu - high quality fish, clean, great ambience, and very cool area especially with the theatre and symphony just around the corner. Their meat, chicken, and udon also gets a good score - the quality of the ingredients is clearly high and that is well appreciated, especially for Japanese restaurants.

The one drawback is that the \"upscale\" atmosphere of the restaurant as compared to other Japanese places can take away from those flavours and variations you look for, particularly in the Udon & Soba departments. I would recommend that you stick with the sushi and to restaurant management, build upon your udon collection and match your creative sushi concoctions back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and it was really busy, but luckily I had reservations. The service was really slow, and I kept on waving to place an order. They didn't give me anything to drink until my first dish came. 

FOOD: I ordered some of my usual favorite items including the sushi deluxe dinner and the yuzu roll. In addition , I ordered the oyster shooter and soft shell crab.

I really liked the soft shell crab and will probably continue to get this. 
However, I was disappointed in the sushi platter.
Generally when I come to Yuzu, I get excited to get the sushi platter since the sashimi tastes VERY fresh. BUT, I didn't find the sashimi that tasty tonight. The sashimi was a bit more bland than usual.


For dessert, I ordered the black sesame ice cream and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"WOW.

I came here for lunch on a weekday with a couple of people. I shared the Sushi/Sashimi for two and it was fantastic. There was a good selection, the fish was fresh, and it looked like art, as though the chef carefully considered where each piece was supposed to go. The third person at my table ordered the Double Decker Bento Box, and the staff was great in offering her options to meet her dietary restrictions. The result also looked wonderful.

That was a really long review. Because really, it just boils down to
WOW."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Best sushi place in the financial district! Maki has very little rice and fish is always fresh! Most rolls are amazing! $$"}
{"text":"I also tired the winterlicious menu.

For is okay in terms of pricing and taste. Portion is a bit small.

Service is average nothing amazing.

I ordered the ice wine, which costed $14 dollars. It tasted good so I ordered a second glass. The second glass was a lot shorter, I spoke to the waitress and she told me the person who poured it previously must have made a mistake. Each bottle of wine costs about $100.

Today I went online to search for that wine, it was only $28 from Lcbo."}
{"text":"Went there for omakase. For a $100 per person, we expected to be lots of good surprises. Other than the oyster shooter, the meal was not impressive. The Kobi beef was the most disappointing as it was tough. It made me wonder if it was really Kobi beef. The fish did not taste as fresh as they should be. The least interesting item was the second last dish which was a small bowl of soba with some tempura. This item was just too common to be included in an omakase. The dessert was a Japanese cheesecake which is also too common to be included in an omakase unless it's Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake! The place was noisy even before it filled up with people. The servers are friendly but we felt being rushed to finish when the restaurant became busy later in the evening. All in all, not the best place for omakase as the quality is not there and you cannot enjoy the meal when you are being rushed to finish. I enjoyed the omakase at Take sushi restaurant but it has been closed since last summer. Kanji serves better omakase but it cost more than Yuzu. The best omakase is still the one I had in Japan."}
{"text":"Really nice sushi.
The service was good, nice selection of sushi, and the sashimi was outstanding."}
{"text":"Really, really good food! I can only comment on the sashimi and nigiri. Everything was very minimalist, Not in a bad way. But a way that let the quality of fish and the preparation speak for itself. Not one bad dish.The live scallop sashimi was one of the best bites of the night."}
{"text":"They are one of the best for sushi especially for freshness, they had live uni in a tank somewhere and that was the best/freshest uni I've ever had. The service and atmosphere is very good, the prices are little on the high side however the quality of the food and good service (they mixed up my wife's and friend's allergy issue which was ok they both switched a couple of things). Overall, I would recommend them, parking is hard to find better to take public transit or walk awhile from the nearest parking lot."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi - way better than I was expecting in North America. I was seated at the sushi bar, and watching the chefs make it was great fun. Service was also spectacular."}
{"text":"Pros:
Sushi and sashimi are fantastic
Very central location
Staff very friendly and professional
Great atmosphere

Cons:
Expensive (up to $15 for one roll)


Overall, giving it 5 stars. If you can afford the $100 dinner+drinks for two, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of sushi and sashimi. Absolutely delicious.
Was not thrilled with the matcha creme brulee but it was interesting to try, something different.
They were quite busy when we were there but the servers were very friendly and acknowledged our wait. They put a candle in my friend's dessert for his birthday which was nice.
Highly recommend! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Standards have dropped very far since our rave review a few years back. Back then, the servers knew what fish was served; the sashimi was incredible - the water content was perfect...not soggy yet just enough to be moist, the flavours of the fish shone so much that using wasabi and soy sauce seemed an insult to the sashimi; and the chef's selection included scallop and octopus in your sashimi dinner... items that made Yuzu stand out amongst all the pop variety sushi places downtown. 

We had dinner at Yuzu Friday. Our soft shell crab appetizer was strange. It had these quinoa looking things making up the batter coating...taste was ok but I'm not a fan of that texture. The crab itself was ok in some places, but a bit fishy in some of the meatier parts. My wife had the double decker bento with salmon teriyaki. The little appetizer items in the bento were good. The tempura was inconsistent, with some quite hard-crunchy instead of that nice light delicate texture and flavour. The salmon was terrible... completely overcooked, bland with flavours coming just from the sauce. My wife could not bring herself to have more than a bite or two. I had the sashimi dinner and got an extra piece, but the fish was quite subpar. What I think was butterfish was more soggy than moist; a lot of the white fish was... fishy...and I needed wasabi and soy sauce to get through; the seared tuna belly (I think) was quite good; salmon and red tuna pieces were unremarkable. Overall, the sashimi has dropped to just an average takeout joint quality. The complimentary black sesame ice cream we got to compensate for the salmon teriyaki was quite good tho - great sesame taste not overpowered by sugar."}
{"text":"We came here for the omakase, and it was such a treat.  We had about eight courses, each beautifully presented.  The only one we struggled with was an entire fish fried in tempura batter.  Not only was it cold, but it was difficult to eat, having small bones.  We weren't told what kind of fish it was. which is the only other comment/suggestion we have - it'd help to have some description or explanation of the omakase.  Besides the tempura fish, we absolutely loved everything else. 

The ambience was great and the service was generally excellent.  We came in on a Wednesday night and it was busy throughout our 2.5 hour stay.  Definitely coming back here- easily the best Japanese we've found so far in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, sat at the bar dining solo.  The only negative could be that the restaurant was kind of dead on a Friday night - not much of a vibe if that is important to you."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. There is nothing defective or bad, really. From the green tea, house salad, miso soup to the sushi plate, everything that I had in this restaurant was perfect. Even music in this restaurant was excellent. :) I am a fan of Japanese foods and kind of picky for choosing restaurants, but I love this restaurant. The chefs and servers are all Japaneses and this is not the fake Japanese restaurant operated by Chinese or Koreans. Authentic. When I travel Toronto again, I will definitely have a lunch or dinner again."}
{"text":"very good service and totaly same taste as real Japanese Restaurant.
I wish come again, my next visit to Toronto.*\(^o^)/*"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night.  I do recommend making reservations.  It was almost full by 7:30.
We ordered the pork belly with kimchi and the tuna tartare as apps.  The pork was amazing.  It was so tender.
That was followed by the sushi deluxe.  We were impressed with the quality of the fish.  Melts in your mouth.
Not being full yet, we ordered another pork belly, 6 pieces of individual sushi and 2 rolls.  Perhaps we ordered a little too much because we were too full.
We will definitely go back for the fresh sushi and the pork belly.  I did not find the rolls any more special than any other restaurant we have been to that are cheaper.
Wait staff was a mix.  Some were super friendly and some were very aloof.  I also found them a little confused at times (such as bringing items to the wrong table a few times.  Also note that it is hard to linger.  We wanted a leisurely dinner but the food kept coming out real fast.  No rest in between dishes.
We each had 2 drinks as well.  We paid about $180 inc tip."}
{"text":"Was there recently and was a bit disappointed. Quality and service have gone down the past few years. Fish did not seem as fresh and appetizers seem to lack a bit more care or quality. For the price, just doesn't compete anymore."}
{"text":"Really like the freshness and flavour of the fish. A bit expensive, but it's okay to splurge on food once in a while."}
{"text":"As a Vancouverite who comes from a land of abundant sushi restaurants that are never short of fresh seafood. I continue on my quest to find sushi joints in Toronto (especially downtown) that are some what comparable. Enter Yuzu, located near the heart of the Entertainment District with ultra modern décor and lighting (think dim lights with exposed brick walls and white table tops). After trying this restaurant it propels to the top of my list for some of the best sushi in downtown. 

We tried our usual sushi choices as a gauge for comparison to other joints but with a few substitutions (salmon, toro, unagi, surf clam, scallop, tobiko, amaebi, cali rolls, and their house special roll). We were impressed with their presentation as they used fried leeks, seaweed, and great care to resurrect appealing dishes of our sushi. Yes the price is a little steep for sushi but on some orders they give you an additional piece of seafood so the value isn't that terrible. Quality and freshness of the seafood is fairly good and surpasses many of the joints on Queen St or Bloor West. They seem to have a good seasonal selection of seafood like tai, uni, fresh water eel, jumbo ameibi, etc that are imported and that'll probably be something we try the next time we're there. My only criticism is their desert, we had the green tea creme brulee, and found that the sugar burned top was really thick and the actual brulee didn't have much green tea flavoring. 

Service was excellent and we found ourselves enjoying our dinner very much due to the great ambiance, food, and decent selection of sakes. They do advertise themselves as a sake bar but don't expect an endless list of sake, it's merely a short selection but offers a good variety including a sake champagne which we tried and can honestly say was fantastic."}
{"text":"The ambience was nice - low lighting, very modern and cozy. The service was very prompt and polite. The food however was just ok. I didn't see anything unique on the menu. We had the spider roll, rainbow roll, crunchy spicy tuna and a few individual nigiri pieces. It was good but not really better than any other sushi place I've been to. Although we didn't indulge, the sake menu did look extensive."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Otoro and hon maguro were delicious and uni from Hokkaido were super fresh!"}
{"text":"i LOVED it here!!

everything about it - its a small place with superb food and good service! would highly recommend it!

Had a variety of sushi roles and they were fantastic - the fish was SO fresh! 
BC Tuna - super hit! the crunchy salmon role was a crowd pleaser. 
Udon noodles were good were good but i personally prefer them at Japango.

Have been back again already and would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to this place by accident after seeing a show. So glad we did! Sushi here is really expensive but you get what you pay for! The quality of the food here is superb! So delicious. One of my fav Toronto sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"Had their Omakase and a la carte. Great omakase experience and nice ambiance. It may be a bit too dimly lit. Plating was nicely done.

Oyster shooter was nice with its quail and uni. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Toronto is replete with great food, and superb sushi. Yuzu No Hana most definitely ticks all the boxes for both top quality fish and a far above average variety.  The dining room is charming with the traditional Japanese flair you want. The urban space constraints only enhance the coziness, like it is in many Japanese sushi bars.  Service, like everyone else has said, is inconsistent depending on where you look. The host is fast and efficient as are the sushi chefs. The servers in my experience were not. The bus boy serving tea had to grab our server twice for us.  Better service would have earned them the fifth star in my book. 

Now, on to the most important part... Food

The oyster shooter is a must try.  The textures and flavors are incredible.  You will love Uni and quail eggs after this one. 

The omakse sushi, sashimi, or dinner are the way to go. The variety was the perfect mix of expected and exotic. 

Perhaps beef tartare isn't in their wheelhouse. While the quality was good, the beef was chopped so fine it was lost in the garnish. 

They have an extensive selection of sake and shochu to complement your meal.  It's a great chance to experiment with some pairings too!

Definitely on my list in Toronto. A delightfully delicious and satisfying night."}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers, great sushi and service.  Being from Vancouver, I didn't expect to find great sushi in Toronto on a cold Sunday night, but you had my back!"}
{"text":"YUZU-NO-HANA....

This place notation is a mystery, at the time I am writing it is rated 4 stars, why?
I went 3 times, I've experienced a lot better for this price.
The decor looks good, the place is clean, you start to feel confident about the food.
Then you get the menu, it is not the cheapest sushi of the area, there is the usual sushi lunch / diner / bento...
When you taste the sushi, you realize it is ok... which is not fine regarding the price, the quality is not great. I would put a better rating if the price was matching the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I visited Yuzu No Hana because of the reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto, with a fancy interior design and great food. I ordered the YUZU bento box and it tastes AWESOME!!! Also for desserts, I highly recommend black sesame ice cream and sake cheesecake."}
{"text":"The first time I was here I was with a group of people who did all the ordering and it was an amaaaazing experience. The food was really fresh, really delicious, and I was in love. Then I told my bf that this place serves the best Japanese food I've had in Toronto and was very excited about bringing him here. But when we went, it was horrible. Nothing we ordered was up to expectations and it felt like we could have had a tastier meal in a regular neighborhood Japanese restaurant for one third the price. I don't know if it was because I didn't order the right things or what, but it was completely different from my memory. The portion was also tiny and even after spending quite a bit we only felt 10% full. To top it off, the service was disappointing. 

I feel like I should give this place another chance but poor students that we are, I don't know if it's worth that risk."}
{"text":"Don't come here for lunch on a weekday.  I came in by myself, seated at the counter.  Waited 5 minutes, no one came by to give me menu.  Waited some more and finally had to literally get up and ask someone to get the menu.  I ordered almost $30 worth of sushi.  Sat there another 10 minutes without any water or tea.  No one came to ask.  Did I have to do all their work for them?  I decided to give them a chance and wait another 10 minutes.  Still no one paid me any attention, so I went to the front and told them to cancel my order.  They simply said \"ok\".  No apologies.  They didn't even asked for an explanation.  I guess they didn't care for my business."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for a few years and developed a love of sushi and sashimi.... a love that has gone unrequited in Toronto.  I understand that this city being so far from the sea limits the availability of fresh seafood, but I've always been surprised at how poor the sushi is in T.O.  (not only the freshness of the fish is lacking:  properly prepared rice with the right amount and type of vinegar is also hard to find).  Then I ate at Yuzu no Hana.   This is by far the best sushi I have had in Toronto.  The flavours were subtle and well-layered:  the sweetness of the rice comes first, then the saltiness of the fish, then the bitterness of the wasabi and vinegar. 

The menu has a nice mix of traditional sushi choices (nigiri toro, yellowtail, etc), plus North American-style sushi (california rolls, the yuzu roll, etc).  All are exceptionally well prepared.

The only thing that was less than perfect was the o-toro.  I think I just have to resign myself to the fact that good toro isn't available inland.  So, my fault for ordering it, not the restaurant's fault for Toronto being so far from the sea:)

The ambiance is nice, the service is friendly, and it is a great dining experience.  It was a quiet mid-week meal, so I'll save sampling the multiple bottles of sake for my next visit."}
{"text":"Ate here once a couple of months ago for an anniversary dinner. It was recommended by my cousin and she was right. Pretty darn good.

Employees were all very attentive and friendly. My tea cup was never empty. As soon as we ordered the dishes never stopped coming and they were well timed. Bf and I ordered a 7 course meal, with many extra fixings on the side (being a special occasion and all) including: deluxe sashimi plate, oyster shots, etc. 

Presentation was excellent. Not one leaf was off, everything was carefully put together. How more impressive can it get when you order the Yuzu roll and it's literally sitting on a bed of fire? Beautiful stuff!   

A bit pricey, but since it was for a particular occasion and it is located downtown I wouldn't expect anything less. So be prepared to shell out a bit more.

By the end I had such a great time I even filled out a survey on my experience and genuinely thanked my server because it was some of the best service I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"Very fresh sashimi here. It is pretty pricey, but the prices for lunch is pretty decent, they are pretty crowded during lunch though by the business crowd, so you have to go early. Staff was efficient and nice and the food was yummy."}
{"text":"Very friendly and clean. It was getting crowded when I went there for dinner so I highly recommend making a reservation. The menu is pretty extensive. You can do a la carte for sashimi and nigiri, or you can also get chef's selection for 30 bucks if you are looking for some fresh raw fish. Ordered their signature yuzu roll which came out with the flame (very cool!! But it dies pretty quickly so if you want to capture it in a photo, do it right away!) Yuzu roll was pretty spicy but in a good way. It was flavourful and the sauce was just amazing. I also tried shrimp nigiri and it was very fresh and tasty.

Next time I go, I would like to try their udon and seafood bowl. But I would say that this place has very fresh sashimi. Highly recommended. 

Took off one star just because I didn't get to try other things on the menu, but I would probably give 5 stars next time."}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of 5 star ratings, but I really liked this place. I came here with my wife on a Friday night. It wasn't super busy, maybe 3/4 full. We ordered the sushi omakase, the Yusu signature roll, uni and hamachi sushi, and a matsutake sushi (super expensive mushroom). The sushi was delicious, the roll came on a super cool flaming dish, and the service was very attentive (our tea was refilled twice).

We'd definitely come back, but would skip the mushroom next time."}
{"text":"Hmm . . .I read all the reviews for Sushi in Toronto and nothing on Yelp knocked me out so I took my chances. I came here for lunch and felt I lucked out. It was good, not great. The next night I wanted to try another sushi place but end up back here. It was not good. The service and food was inexcusable. I was seated at the bar and a solid 15 minutes went before I was waited on and that was because the sushi chef sensed my frustration. I watched the chefs carefully and purposefully cut, prepare and plate dozens of beautiful dishes. Then came my, from which chef I do not know but the presentation was mediocre at best. The taste was mediocre at best. I was really trying hard to accept it all, but again the chef sensed something wrong. Then suddenly he handed me this beautiful plate of sushi. I told him I already ate. I also said those are the same pieces of fish I just ate. He looked surprised. I was full but felt bad and ate what he prepared. We did talk awhile about Toronto, sushi, and life in general, as much as we could with a language barrier. I really liked this guy and wish him well, but will not be back to this place.

I know the food here can be good, but certainly it's hit or miss, which is a management problem and a problem with a lot of sushi places. The staff was very nice but frazzled. I hope they can fix things."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to Yuzu about twice a month, however the last 2 visits have been  huge disappointments. I am not certain, but maybe they've changed management. They changed the menu and increased the prices.  Quality is sub-standard.  My friend and I ordered the sushi/sashimi platter and the fish just was not fresh and portions were smaller as well.  Sadly, I will not be going back anymore."}
{"text":"One of our favourite sushi places in Toronto.

Good atmosphere, generally attentive service and the food is fresh. 

We usually order about 4-5 rolls to share between two people. All of the rolls come very well presented. We usually get the spicy cruncy salmon, spider, dynamite and rainbow rolls. The Yuzu maki roll comes out with fire under the plate, sort of looks like flambe, which is cool to get at least once. We did however find that it was too saucy. 

We've tried the appetizer scallops and shimeji which was delicious."}
{"text":"They dont bring your order together! One person finishes the plate while the other is starving. I guess thats their feature. The dishes are pretty though. But for that price they better be!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had time to blog about my food adventures for my birthday back in March, time to catch up. My friend and I tried this Japanese place in the Entertainment District. Pretty nice atmosphere, our table was facing the sushi chef. We got the Yokihi cocktail - sweet and refreshing taste of lychee and pomegranate with a splash of sake. Very refreshing and resemble like a Bellini.

We first start off with soft shell crab with ponzu sauce. Freshly fried but not much taste to it even with the sauce. Next was the sashimi platter of the chef's selection, from salmon to tuna and other fish that I couldn't remember. Really fresh, really tasty, I especially like the white fish.

Then came the Yuzu maki - shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado, tobiko. It was seared at our table, meaning it was served with a plate of flames underneath. It was pretty cool, it was still flaming at our table for awhile. My friend got scared but I thought it was pretty cool. It was quite spicy, but it was very delicious. We were still hungry afterwards so we ordered the Nabeyaki udon - udon, shrimp tempura, scallop, white fish, egg, vegetables in a hot pot. I love the broth, it was a little sweet and good taste of fish broth. So good, made the udon taste so good. After this bowl, we were really full. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Toronto. I've never liked \"all you can eat sushi\" restaurants much which is why Yuzu is perfect for me. Some may feel that it's a bit pricey but the quality of their food is excellent. I love both the sashimi and nigiri, great selection of rolls (I recommend the Yuzu Maki), and in addiction to that, they are served in beautiful plating design with excellent service. Recommended to all! Very clean and classy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really bad. Nice looking place but a terrible dining experience. Hamachi Kama should never have left the kitchen...burnt beyond recognition. Nigiri way too tiny for the price. I asked if the tamago was real and they said yes...not!  I sent it back. Unagi is microwaved...a sin. Wait staff is not attentive. Served me nigiri and then I waited 10 minutes for soy sauce. I have no idea how they have such a high rating. I really felt that they should be ashamed to offer this as Japanese food. They'd never survive serving this garbage in NY or California...and never in Japan. It's insulting to customers and to Japanese cuisine. Max 2 stars but I drop it to 1 star because they just didn't seem to care.  I felt bad for the sushi chef because he was clearly embarrassed but the waitresses and cooks need serious fixing. Look elsewhere for a more authentic experience with better service. Never again."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place downtown, love their signature roll, can't remember the exact name, and the tempura udon which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to place for sushi. Sushi is fresh and enjoyable. It's not loud and crowded which it perfect for a night out for a great sushi dinner."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't rated my favourite Japanese restaurant yet.  I think everything is impeccable here - the decor, service, ambiance and most importantly the food.  I have yet to be disappointed.

The fish is super fresh, but I enjoy their maki rolls the most.  The different ingredients combine together to give the rolls a unique taste.

What I love best here though?.  The black sesame ice-cream!  It's the real deal here, made with real black sesame and not just vanilla ice cream with black sesame.  I can't find anywhere else that carries the same (even at T&T).  If you do know where they get their ice cream, please let me know!"}
{"text":"Sushi is my first go to when I first start travelling to a city. It's predictable, gluten free, and filling enough to stave off hunger for a while. Yuzu No Hana was my first foray into TO sushi and in one visit I tried a variety of rolls with the seafood rice bowl (shrimp, tobiko, scallops, seasoned vegetables, quail egg, rice, in hot stone bowl).

The food was neither good nor bad... just meh and rather bland. The rolls were generous in ingredients but oddly had no taste except for a smattering of sesame seeds. Strangely, there was no wasabi or ginger. I was able to swap out the shrimp tempura for plain shrimp in the rice bowl, but again, the whole dish was really bland. Also, the stone bowl wasn't hot enough to make the rice crunchy at the bottom (the best part of stone bowl rice dishes)... this may have been an unexpected good thing because the restaurant was super hot like a sauna (adding a hot bowl to the table would have made the temperature worse).

I don't actually know what to expect for sushi in Toronto. Perhaps my expectations are high after working/living on the West Coast for 4-years where even supermarket sushi is super fresh and melts in your mouth. 

I will say that the wait staff (especially my waitress) were really sweet and friendly. The two-star rating is for the food."}
{"text":"I eat at Yuzu about once every couple of months. I keep going back cause their rolls are exceptional. I highly recommend the Yuzu maki. It is flavourful and the combination of shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado, and tobiko is perfect. To top it all off, there is this awesome blue flame that surrounds the roll. The ambiance is nice, and service is good."}
{"text":"Good place for a date... Fresh, good service, good rolls. A little pricey for the overall value but the location makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"The ambience of Yuzu no Hana reminded me a lot of Jabistro, and prices were pretty similar (if not cheaper). I went on a week night - made a reservation but didn't need to. I would recommend this place for date night - the dim lighting was very romantic. 

I ordered the Sushi Omakase, which included 18 pieces of sushi and had a claim miso soup as a starter. The miso soup was quite delicious, but very salty, which I attributed to the clams. What was strange was the waitress never told us the different types of fish included in the omakase. While tuna, salmon & uni were quite distinctive, there were various unknown white and pink fish on the platter and I was guessing as I ate.  I also ordered the lobster roll - the roll was quite filling but the taste of avocado was overwhelming, I couldn't  really taste the lobster. The sauce that came with the lobster roll was the stand out - the right balance of sweet and salty. 

Overall, service was alright - they came to refill our tea fairly often but we had to ask a few times for our bill. It was a weeknight so there was not a lot of staff. Food wasn't amazing nor unique, but I had a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Food is okay..but somehow I found every time I go there, their table are sticky!! Literally sticky!! And the plates are greasy..and they don't even bother to replace some old bowls...awwww come on!! You guys can be better!!"}
{"text":"Lovely place for an evening out and special occasions. I ordered a crunchy tuna roll, agedashi tofu, and black sesame ice cream. Everything tasted very good and fresh! I have no complaints. While there are quite a few negative reviews on here about the items on the Winterlicious menu, my father ordered off the menu and enjoyed it very much. He said that while he was satisfied by it, probably most Canadians with a larger appetite would not be. But since he just returned from Japan I suppose he was used to the portions and was very pleased. I would come here again :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic sushi.  It was fresh, flavorful, varied, and beautifully prepared.  Ordered various sashimi at the bar.  I grew up in Japan, and this place really feels like a true japanese sushi bar.  The sushi chef was friendly and helpful when we asked questions."}
{"text":"I have a friend who has been raving about this place for years now. She's a good friend who likes good food, so combined with her endorsement and the solid Yelp reviews, my husband and I chose this place to commemorate a special occasion. 

We had the oyster shooter and Hokkaido scallop (the scallop was my favourite thing we are all night) to start. We also got the sushi omakase - the fish was fresh enough, I guess - and 2 different types of very forgettable rolls. 

There is nothing wrong with Yuzu except that the sushi is comparable to any random sushi place in a Markham strip mall. It is nothing to write home about and I do not understand the hype at all. The ambience and product does not match the price point. It is a very average sushi spot."}
{"text":"service was rushed, kept trying to take away plates before we finished, food was fine but nothing great"}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi. Nice place for a date night. A little on the expensive side but worth it in my opinion. Good choice of sake as well. Can get a little busy on weekend nights after 8."}
{"text":"Great dinner experience!  First time at the restaurant and will visit again.  We had: Agedashi Tofu and Tuna and Avocado tartare to start, Crunch Roll, Yuzu roll, o-toro sushi and uni sushi.  The fish is fresh, O-toro melts in your mouth ($20 for 2 pc) and the uni is delish.  We sat at the sushi bar on a Friday night and were literally served our first few dishes within 4 mins of ordering, literally.  Great service, yummy sushi, good place!

Most rolls are reasonably priced to boot!  $10-14/roll.."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the great feedback on Yelp. I found the food very presentable and service was great. I don't know if I think it should be rated a perfect 5 star only because the price seemed a little above average.  Our lunch consisted of some sashimi, friend chicken karage and a noodle soup dish. They tasted OK but didn't think it was that memorable."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for helping me discover this hidden gem in my own backyard. My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place. High quality, great value, friendly service, warm ambience...needless to say, it's constantly in our rotation for eating out.  Try the namesake flaming sushi roll, it's sublime.   The chef's sashimi selection changes regularly and never disappoints.  If you're a sushi lover, do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"I've never imagined to discover in Toronto one of the best sushi places I ever found outside of Japan. So good I had to go twice in the few days I stayed in the city.

DISHES
We ordered both edamame, the sushi deluxe, miso soup and a temaki. The edamame was well prepared but well, edamame can't be that fancy. However the real surprise arrived with the sushi deluxe: an impressive selection of fish, incredibly well presented and also with each nigiri prepared with a unique touch: some of them with a dash of sesame seeds, some of them with a tiny daikon slice on top, and so on. And if the presentation wasn't enough, the taste was incredible too. Each piece was absolutely well balanced, tasty and tender. There were also some kinds of fish that I rarely see, all of them created an incredibly balanced dish.

AMBIENT AND SERVICE
The ambient is very well refined, a little luxurious but not too much to be oppressive. It's clearly a curated environment crafted to give the right dining experience. Well separated table give also enough space to have a comfortable dinner with friends.
The service is excellent, attentive and on time, a bit on the shy side.

Just try it. If you're in Toronto, if you travel through Toronto or for any reason you're near there, go to Yuzu No Hana. You will find one of the best sushi ever that will rank high in your top 10 chart."}
{"text":"The pics contain two sets of winterlicious dinner. 

I'm very disappointed on their winterlicious 2018. 

As a girl with small appetite, the food portion was so tiny that I felt like it was just a appetizer. For the main dish, there were fish bones in the sushi. The dessert, green tea tiramisu, its bottom was soaked with water which it tasted gross.

Will NEVER visit again."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto, and meeting up with a friend from Montreal. She picked this restaurant based on the reviews on Yelp, and I am so glad she did. I am Japanese, living in BC, so have pretty low expectation when it comes to sushi in Ontario(sorry!) But this was great. We had edamame, scallops with shimeji, assorted sashimi, and spicy tuna rolls. SO good. Very sophisticated and creative. Loved the black sesame ice cream, too. Will definitely be back next time I'm in TO."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Delicious tempura and noodle bowl! Excellent, fast, and polite service.  Great dragon roll, too."}
{"text":"Fav spot when I'm craving good sushi. Great selection of sake. Great service and quality of food. Never had a bad experience here in the many times I've been. Can't go wrong with any of the rolls or sashimi. Presentation is excellent as well. Low key and mellow atmosphere with very attentive staff. A stark contrast to a Guu or other loud sushi spot. So would recommend if you're just looking for a chill night at an intimate spot which is definitely a nice option to have."}
{"text":"Had the Sushi and Sashimi Lover with the Yuzu Roll (the one that's on fire)
Sashimi was fresh, succulent (actually viable here) and each had a well preserved flavor profile
Came during the busy lunch hours but service was quick and attentative
Will definitely return"}

Yuzu No Hana is located on Adelaide St W close to Entertainment district where Scotia Bank theatre is located. I've been wanting to check out Yuzu No Hana for awhile ever since I moved to Toronto- since so many people recommended it to me.

However, I never had a chance to check it out until recently and I personally think it has to do with lack of parking.. but than again, that's the case for any restaurants located downtown.

Yuzu No Hana could be a little tricky to find, since the store front sign isn't that big- but just look for the red sandwich board sign!
I walked in as soon as they opened for dinner service and found the restaurant to be quite spacious with lots of tables as well as bar seating.

As soon as I sat down, they served me some hot green tea which was nice. I sat around for another 15 minutes waiting for a friend and the server constantly checked up on me to see if I needed anything.

Ordered: Anago Nigiri 1/5

* Fresh water eel (unagi) sashimi is $10 and nigiri is $7
* I saw this on someone's instagram and really wanted to try it
* I showed them the photo that I saved on my phone (yes, I really wanted it)
* Now that I think about it, I don't know why they charged me $10 when I got nigiri
* I wasn't served what I expected, it looked small, sad and dry
* I don't think I would get this again

Ordered: Scallops and shimeji 3/5

* Scallops, shimeji mushroom and sake butter sauce for $12
* This was one of the appetizers we ordered and it was really good
* Sauce was little too strong and overwhelming but the earthy mushrooms accompanied grilled scallops very well
* Would recommend this if you weren't having sashimi for dinner since it is very strong in flavor

Ordered: Seafood Bowl 5/5

* Shrimp tempura, tobiko, scallops, seasoned vegetables, quail egg and rice in hot stone bowl for $19
* This is basically like Japanese version of Sashimi-Don (Hwae-Dub-Bab)
* I liked how they were very generous with all the seafood
* There are 2 options for sauce (spicy sauce and soy sauce)
* It's important to mix in everything while the stone pot is still hot to get that crispy rice on the bottom
* I would get this again if I went back

Ordered: Sashimi deluxe 4/5

* 21 pieces of sashimi, chef's selection for $35
* This was your typical sashimi platter and I enjoyed it
* I didn't find any of the sashimi to be particularly amazing but I still liked it

Summary: I am glad I tried out Yuzu No Hana- staff was friendly and the food was solid. If you want good Japanese food in downtown but don't want to spend too much (ie.JaBistro), Yuzu No Hana would be perfect. If you are looking for Japanese restaurant anywhere in Toronto, I would also recommened Inatei that's located on highway 7 which is one of my favorite Japanese spots. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I give 5 star rating for this place. The food is fresh and the service is fast also.

It remind me the time I was in Japan. All of my friends had a good time here. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I admit that I am not a sushi expert but can tell the difference when I really enjoy my experience and when it's more like... it's OK. This is exactly how this place is. OK. Service was relatively slow despite the place being quite empty (shocking for a nice summer day outside and lunch) - but usually that doesn't really affect my rating. I simply did not have an experience to put me over the top. Food was good, got the job done, paid and left. Honestly, the only time I may come back here is if I run out of ideas in downtown Toronto... which is quite hard to do."}
{"text":"I remember dining here a couple years ago and being blown away by the sushi quality and flavour. 

Returned yesterday night, and unfortunately, the sushi lacked its previous lustre. Ordered the sushi omakase dinner, which came with 18 pieces of assorted sushi, as well as a few rolls. The fish didn't seem as fresh and flavorful as I remember it. Although there were apparently 18 different types of fish, each piece of nigiri couldn't really be distinguished from the other apart from color. 

The service was uncoordinated. We had three different servers serve our table. The dishes for my dining partner came out at a different time, meaning there was a lapse in when we started eating. At the end of our meal, one server asked us if we were interested in dessert and we declined. A few minutes later, another server came by and asked us about dessert again.  

Perhaps my expectations were too high based on past experience, but yesterday's meal was pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"A work colleague and I had dinner here.  We thought the sushi was outstanding, and the service was great.  We split the sushi and sashimi moriawase (chef's selection of 25 pieces of nigiri and sashimi) along with a soft-shelled crab spider roll and some toro and wild salmon nigiri.  The fish was delicious and well-presented.  What I would NOT plan on is a full bar.  They have the basics (gin, vodka, scotch, etc) but one bottle of each and no bartender.  So, go for the fish, the beer/sake/wine, the great atmosphere, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thanks again, Yelp, for the great suggestion!

I came here to eat by myself (on business) and was seated in the corner by the window, facing a couple directly across a couple who loved making out.  Super.

Service: The waitresses and \"director of operations\" as he put it were very helpful and very accommodating and hospitable.  Service was great - I was immediately served [delicious] hot tea after arriving, probably because I looked like I was freezing in the crazy cold outside.

Atmosphere: Love it!  I didn't feel weird eating by myself (other than the lovey dovey couple in front of me).  There were only 3 parties including myself in the restaurant on a Monday night - I feel like I could have been sat somewhere else lol.  Plentiful seats and a nice bar area.

Food: 

Asari sakamushi - manila clams steamed in sake + mushrooms.  SO DELICIOUS.  I would definitely recommend this dish if you are a shellfish lover.  Watch out for the couple of pieces of runaway sand/rock.  Favorite of my 3 dishes.

Spicy salmon roll - yum!  Fresh salmon.  Wasn't a fan of the cucumber, though.  Never had spicy salmon roll with cucumber.  They use spicy chili oil instead of the nasty crunchy spicy sriracha mix that some sushi restaurants sometimes use.  

Nabeyaki udon - needed this after trekking the cold.  Udon was good texture and the broth was flavorful and perfect for the cold weather.  Lots of different seafood in it as well.  Not a fan of the chinese celery.

Paid for my meal and was given a card to call if I ever went back - was told I'd be taken care of - whatever that means!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner at 8:30 on a Saturday night. Opentable said no reservations left so we were expecting somewhat of a wait but were seated right away. We (me and my boyfriend) elected to sit at the sushi bar-- great decision! The sushi chefs were extremely friendly, telling us what the were making and what the recommended. 

Ended up ordering:
Miso soup-- just average run of the mill miso
Tuna avocado tartar-- amazing! Tons f tuna and basically a whole avocado with garlic seasoned olive oil and another sauce. Big enough to split between 2 
Rainbow, spicy tuna, California rolls-- all great rolls with really fresh ingredients. Even added avocado to spicy tuna without a charge! Price for all of this was under $50

Ended up styling a while after our meal, hitch we had taken our time with, and talked to the sushi chefs. So knowledgeable!  Such a great experience we have decided to go back tonight for the Chet's choice menu."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.

Only somehow a few little things bothered us. The beef tartare still had a couple of pieces that were a tad frozen and the sushi chef selection was tasty for the most part, but a couple of the choices just didn't make sense, like the bara because cooked bara has no flavour.

Otherwise, food was very good quality and the portions were bigger than expected, especially the starters.

Despite the high rating and overall quality, unlikely to come back again because the menu just didn't have anything particularly different or enticing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it. Food was tasty and the extra care was felt. Service was plain in comparison. 

The rolls were made with the thinnest layer of rice I've seen in any restaurant. Kudos, this takes skill. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after reading the positive reviews. I have to say that everything was great up until we started ordering. The staff seemed pretty welcoming, we were greeted and seated right away, and the ambience was very nice (charming decor, not too loud) as well.

On the other hand, the experience after that was not up to standard at all. When asked to recommend a dish on the menu, the waitress just mumbled something and said that it was \"up to us\". Feeling like having sushi, we ordered the omakase - can't go wrong with that, right?

Unfortunately, I regretted spending money on the \"chef's pick\". About half of the sushi pieces tasted fine, but the other half was definitely not as fresh as I would expect. Presentation was just meh - like they simply stuck everything in rows, with some of the fish and rice even falling apart as soon as they were picked up. Also, the server did not bother explaining or naming any of the sushi, just set the plate on the table and walked away. Tea was NEVER refilled. Asked for water - the bill showed up first. Well, OK. 

Won't be back - there are so many other similar restaurants to try in the area."}
{"text":"I took my sister for her birthday dinner to Yuzu.  I would have to say it is one of better sushi places in Toronto.

Food

Squid rings - aka calamari rings - very good, they used a panko crust and it was not overtly grease.  The sauce it came with was not very memorable.

Tuna tartare - one word - wow.  Well balanced with avocado and dressing.  I could not stop eating it, the only downside was that I had to share.

Sushi & Maki rolls - so fresh and delicious.  The Sashmi melts in your mouth.  We ordered the green river roll and red dragon roll, both were excellent.

Dessert

Black sesame ice cream - oh so good, it is like a peanut butter type ice cream.  A bit salty yet sweet.  Do not be turned off by the colour, this ice cream might change your life.

Service

Quick to order and attentive.  Our plates were cleared without asking.  I was impressed.

Atmosphere

Kinda funky, dimly light and very asian inspired.  It was packed on a Friday night.  I would recommend this place for a romantic dinner night out.

Price

For 3 - the bill was $140 with tip and tax.  Great food and service, it was worth the money.


If you are in the Entertainment district and craving some good sushi, check out Yuzu!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.   Everything was fresh, well flavored, and artfully crafted.  We started with the asari sakamushi (manila clam in a sake broth with shimeji mushrooms).   As good as the clams and mushrooms were, the star of the dish was the broth.   It was flavorful, light, and complimented the clams perfectly.   We loved the touch of orange peels in the broth to give it a little citrus accidity.  Highly recommended.

For the main course, my wife chose the signature Yuzu roll and the lobster roll.   Both the rolls were simply amazing.  The lobster roll was made with real lobster tail meat and cucumber, with the right amount of sauce to bring out the taste of the lobster.   The Yuzu roll was beautifully presented (with flames dancing from the bottom of the plate).   It consisted of a shrimp tempura roll with a charred salmon and scallop on top.   The flavor has a little spicy kick and was superb.    

The seafood rice bowl is similar to a Korean Bi Bim Bap rice bowl served in a hot stone bowl.  Yuzu's twist is with seafood instead of the traditional meat.   The flavor of the clams, shrimp, and scallops all blended perfectly.  The rice was just right, with the crunchy rice on the bottom of the bowl done to perfection.  

We were stuffed, but had to try out the dessert offering.  My wife chose the green tea tiramisu.  It was very good.   Traditional tiramisu melded nicely with the green tea flavor.

We would highly recommend this place if you are in the downtown area of Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was 4stars.  Service was zero stars.  We ordered our meals from someone we later found out was the Operations Manager.  We waited a long time and then one of the waitresses came by and asked us \"did you order xyz?\"  We flagged down the Operations Manager and told him that we'd been waiting awhile and asked if they forgot about our order (which is a fair conclusion given that they had to check what we ordered).  

The guy, after apologizing and offering a round of free drinks (at which point we would've been perfectly satisfied) proceeded to offer an in-deph rationalization behind the ordering process, showed us the order ticket with a time stamp, and insisted that this was their normal process.  He then pointed at our order on the counter and said very loudly such that tables around us could hear, \"hey buddy, there it is.\"  Later when our drinks came, he again went on a tirade, showing us the order ticket and offering the excuse that he was interjecting in the wait staff's normal process, hence the slippage.  I pointed out to him that according to the time stamp on the order ticket, they were being tardy; his defence - \"let's not get technical.\"  At which point, my girlfriend laughed at him and he threatened us with \"you don't have to eat here.\"  He would not make eye contact with us for the rest of the meal.

WTF.  Hey buddy - a tip going forward - apologize, offer the drinks, and go away.  My gf and I were looking at each other and asking ourselves \"is this really happening?\" Unreal.   Based on the food, I'd return. Sadly, the Operations Manager ensured that we will not be returning or recommending this place to any of our friends."}
{"text":"The food here is very, very poor.  Really shocked at the positive reviews.  All their food is designed to look good on Instagram, but it all tastes awful.  Why is everything so wet?  Who wants salad in a literal puddle of dressing?  Who wants deep fried tofu served in a bowl of broth so that the tofu is a soggy, disintegrating mess?  Good lord."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and got in the mood for sushi. After reading the reviews for Yuzu and seeing it was close to our hotel, we decided to go there. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Their miso soup and ginger salad dressing were delicious and the sushi was very fresh and yummy. My husband said he wished the spicy tuna was a bit spicier, but that's not for everyone. We were so full we didn't order desserts. However, we did have some of their fun alcohol drinks. We will definitely recommend Yuzu to others."}
{"text":"Some of the best Japanese food I've ever had.... just spectacular. And, the black sesame ice cream was out of this world!!"}
{"text":"If you like Japango, you'll LOVE Yuzu.

It's like the trendier, big sister of Japango.  
Exposed brick, lofty space... You feel like you're dining on King Street and the sushi is actually good.

Service was excellent and a lot of the waitstaff are actually Japanese.
They fly their fish in from Japan and Europe, and have fish specials  each week.

We had the agedashi tofu warm appetizer, the tofu was fried and smothered in a salty and sweet broth.

The oyster shooters were pieces of art at $7 bucks a pop.
Raw oyster and quail egg that comes in a decorative shot glass. You take the shot in your mouth and slowly chew to get the mix of flavors.
Definitely a stand out item on the menu.

Kaisendon YUZU style was delicious.  Rice, sashimi, and hot sauce.  It reminded me of bibimbap... but with chunks of raw fish and not served in a hot stone bowl.

All the sushi was super fresh and perfect.  Some pieces were topped with deep fried lotus or garlic, each piece was delightful.

The special was the seabream which had an interesting smokey flavour.

My meal was excellent and this place is one of my new favorite spots.

If you eat there once a week, you may even get your own special chopsticks stored behind the bar.

I was debating whether I had a 4 or 5 star experience.
But, I'm hooked.
5 stars."}
{"text":"I went to Yuzo No Hana during Summerlicious to try their set menu.

The meal started with an appetizer of a tuna avocado tartare. The tartare was fair overall - the avocado was fresh and the tuna was tasty, but the portion was quite small - only about a bite or two at most. 

Next was the chef's selection of sushi. The fish was quite good overall and the portions were fair for the price, but it was nothing above expectations. 

For dessert, we were served a match creme brule. It was good overall, but tasted more like sugar than matcha.

All in all, it was a good meal, but without the Summerlicious promotion, I would likely not return."}
{"text":"The dark wood decor and low lighting makes for a sleek dining experience, with enough space between the tables for a small group or couple to dine comfortably. The comfortable seating is a main draw for me here.  Not that the food is bad, because it's not - it's much better than the random popular student sushi joints, as the Japanese owned and run Yuzu ensures the fish is fresh and chefs are infinitely more skilled in sushi and presentation. The chefs are also very kind and friendly, especially if you sit at the sushi bar where they seem genuinely concerned about whether you are enjoying your meal.

My favourite dishes:
- Asari sakamushi (manila clams, shimeji mushroom, yuzu, sake) - A delicate broth, scented by the clams really brings out their sweetness
- Oyster shooter - Uni, raw oyster, ponzu jelly, green onion, all topped with a creamy quail's egg. How can you go wrong?
- Anago/Sea eel - When in season, it's a hefty piece! Served broiled, it's not quite as fluffy and sweet, but still a good deal
- Uni or salmon roe with quail's egg sushi - Surprisingly not that easy to find in Toronto sushi places. People, spread the word, this combo is delicious!
- Yuzu maki - Like their sister restaurant, Japango, this seared roll sings

So why only 3 stars? I guess it's because even though I like this place, there's nothing about it that really stands out to me to really *love* it - the pricing is fair considering the district, but not exactly cheap, either.  The platters are served prettily, but the quality isn't amazing. Overall, I'd say come here if the focus is on your company and the food is a secondary."}
{"text":"I came here because of the many good yelp reviews on a pretty quiet night and ended up ordering more and more, trying different things, as everything was so good. 

Both service and food presentation are very good and their selection is great (they even put gold foil on their hq mp tuna). Sushi and sashimi sizes are well above average and the quality is outstanding. This is really one of the best sushis I had and their pricing is very reasonable. I will for sure be back whenever I make it to toronto and will recommend Yuzu to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Toronto. I haven't tried all of them but I'm definitely a sushi snob.

The presentation is always superb and the food even better. I've never been disappointed with the freshness of the fish.

The price is good for the quality of food you're getting, especially compared to the supposedly amazing sushi out there.

In the evening, the atmosphere is very cozy so it's a perfect spot for a date, if you and your date love Japanese food.

They also have an excellent sake selection! I usually come out full and tipsy. =P

I have brought a lot of Japanese friends there over the years and they have unanimously said that this place is Japan level good.

This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Went for what ended up being a delicious dinner with a friend! Everything tasted fresh, the fish melted in our mouths! We had the sashimi plate and a few rolls - we enjoyed every bite and presentation was nice. Only downside was we had difficulties getting the attention of our server when we wanted drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Yuzu sushi recently for a very special celebratory dinner (after reading all of its rave Yelp reviews). 

The reviews were dead on as the food at Yuzu was beyond delicious!

We started our meal with the melt-in-your mouth tuna tartare... Having just recently returned from a vacation to Hawaii where raw pickled tuna is the standard fare, the tuna tartare was a welcome start to our meal. Next, we had the calamari starter which was simply ok as it was akin to the $5 calamari starter dishes at cheaper sushi restaurants (it wasn't all that tender, and there was nothing all that extraordinary about its flavour). 

We then moved on to the sashimi platter, which I'd highly recommend. Salmon, tuna, butterfish, shrimp and scallop were the chef's offerings for the day (3 pieces of each). All were divine, but the raw scallops soaked in lemon juice were the to-die-for item... 

Next, we had the signature yuzu maki, which was a tad on the expensive side (close to $20 for the roll), but very much worth the price. The roll was presented beautifully and was served aflame. It included a lovely blend of different types of fish, and quite the variety of flavours. 

Finally, we finished off with the black sesame ice cream (as quite a few reviewers had raved about it) - To me, it was just alright (it tasted very much like a peanut butter cup). 

In terms of décor - Yuzu is quite modern, dark, clean-lined. The service was good, though not out of this world. My only complaint would be the music - Is there really a need to play loud club music at a restaurant on a Monday night? It just didn't jive with the feel of the restaurant. Though, the server did ask us if we wanted her to turn the music down... and, we said yes please.

Overall though, I highly recommend Yuzu to all the sushi lovers in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This is easily one of the best sushi bars in the city.  Incredibly fresh fish, a relaxing and inviting atmosphere and some incredibly talented sushi chefs making amazing artistic rolls, along with tasty morsels of sushi/sashimi.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty sensational.  The salmon sushi was so soft and delicious.  Really outstanding flavors.  Only 4 stars because there was all sorts of drama with my dinner reservation which happened in front of two clients.  I do not appreciate calling in for reservations, receiving confirmation, and then having to deal with drama at the front desk.  We were finally sat thankfully."}
{"text":"Get the oyster shooters and be sure to ask for the fresh fish menu."}
{"text":"FAN-EFFING-TASTIC!

Japango by Dundas is usually my go-to spot for Japanese food (I will walk 10 blocks to eat there rather than eat at some crappy Chinese-run fake Japanese food place).

Now, I can feel better about being around this part of town because I've found Yuzu no Hana.

LOVE the food. Beautiful presentation, the fish was SO FRESH, and I was completely full and happy at the end.

I took sashimi and sushi and was not disappointed.

I'll also highly recommend the sake cheesecake at the end. There is actual alcohol in there and I can taste it, because it gave me a slight buzz (I don't normally drink, so everything affects me).

SO. YUMMY. I have no idea what the other reviewers are saying if they think it's not that great because the sashimi was top notch that day."}
{"text":"The sushi was excellent. It was a very nice place. The service was awesome! I would certainly recommend going here. It was a bit pricey though"}
{"text":"One of a few delicious sushi restaurants in Toronto! The fish is fresh and the chef knows his stuff! Tip: We always order the Japango roll - it's off the menu and so YUMMY! It's a California roll with seared butterfish on top. Their butterfish sushi is very tasty, one of the best! Salmon is always uber fresh. 
The service is very good with friendly and attentive staff all around.  Great ambiance for a dinner date or a business lunch. This our GO TO spot for sushi in all of the GTA."}
{"text":"Having moved from Reston, Virginia recently, my husband and I were pretty disappointed with most sushi places that we tried. Most that we had been too were within the $40/50 price range for two.. wouldn't call it cheap but not the most expensive we have had either. Since these mid-range places were just bad, we decided to shell out the dollars at Yuzu. Its expensive, so it has to be good - my theory, my husband doesn't agree but thankfully I was right this time!

Yuzu No Hana was amazing! We started out with the gyoza (I love that stuff) and then moved on to the Sashimi and rolls. We tried one of the chef's special for sashimi that day ($20!) and it was so good, it melted in your mouth! Then we tried  the Dynamite, Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia and the Yuzu maki. Yuzu maki was the best! The flavours were just right and i couldn't get enough if it. Philadelphia was my least favourite but thats cause I don't like cream cheese in my sushi (Mr.H picked that one). The rest of the rolls were the best I've had in Toronto so far.

Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Albacore tuna - amazing, melt in your mouth 
Gyoza - Awesome! Didn't fall apart, juices didn't make it too hot.
Salmon roll - Amazing, nice marbling in the fish
Yam roll - Alright, rice a little dry/crunchy
Gluten free soy upon request

Salmon and Avocado - rice again a little dry, not as much as the yam.
Dragon - Alright, least favorite roll of the night.
Unagi nigiri - Great flavour, not too stringy. 

Mood lighting and fairly quick service!

Warm sake - $13 for a large size. Tasty, tasty. Large sake list. Wanted the plum wine, but too much for my blood."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING. (Feels too mean to give it a 2).

3 stars for the moderately good service, nice ambience, and food presentation.

HOWEVER, the food itself was disappointing. I had the $80 Omakase as recommended on blogs through my online research. I've had more expensive and also cheaper Omakase dinners at other Japanese restaurants, and unfortunately this was the worse.

I won't go through each dish, but all in all the seafood was not very fresh. My oyster shooter tasted like the oyster had been shucked and prepared hours before. Sashimi was not as fresh as other restaurants.Many sashimis were very very fishy. The best dishes were cooked dishes - the worst dishes were the cold or raw dishes.

All in all, sad to say, I would not go back.
If you're going for Omakase I recommend ND Sushi's for $50 - they use the freshest of ingredients.

That is all!"}
{"text":"I dropped in to Yuzu while on a business trip.  Overall, the food quality and service were really good.  I particularly enjoyed a Green River roll, and their Saba. 

I had an interesting experience while sitting at the sushi bar.  There were three sushi chefs, and the last one took a fresh Aji (small mackerel) to fillet it.  He concentrated as he made simple but studied cuts in the fish.  The two other sushi chefs stood at their respective stations, but were mesmerized by the expert skills of the senior sushi chef.  At first I thought they were captivated by his careful work, but as it continued, I came to wonder if they respected not just him, and the fish, but also the ritual.

Really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great place. The food is amazing. I tried the Sushi set and the wagyu beef set. The kobe beef is very juicy and tasty. Reasonable price for associated nigiri sushi set. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Okay, so finally I made it to Yuzu. And it was as I thought it would be: great, FANTASTIC FOOD, and chique ambiance.

This restaurant can be hard to miss as the signage is very small. FYI! There are several parking options but the cheapest is the Parking Building right across from the restaurant, at $7 for the entire night. Also, if you plan on parking on the street, BEWARE OF THE PARKING POLICE! My bf got a ticket for going over his time limit, and my friend got a ticket for parking too close to the fire hydrant. In fact, we saw the parking police go through Adelaide Street 3 times!

The restaurant is quite small, and the ambiance is woods-y, romantic and chique. I already knew what I wanted so I ordered Tuna Tartare (YUM!), and the Yuzi Bento which is a bento box in two layers. This meal is HUGE and it comes with everything you want: choice of salmon, beef or chicken teriyaki, rice, sushi, sashimi and all the fried goodness that is Tempura. For $30, it is not the cheapest option, however, it is filling (and can I repeat the food was very good!?!?!)

A friend also ordered Oyster Shooters for everyone as an appetizer, but that was not what I was expecting: small (hence a shooter) but with some cold murky stuff. One friend swallowed a shell, and my bf said it was like shooting down salt. At $7, that could be a pass.

Service was very accommodating, however, the place was not busy for a Wednesday night. They do separate bills and I saw the total turn out to be $360 and change. My bf and I spent $120 including tax and tip so it's not the cheapest option, but the food is very good. 

Great place for a romantic night out or a large group gathering!"}
{"text":"Yuzu is a high end sushi place located in the Entertainment district, so the prices reflect that. We had - tuna tartare (so so so good,  wish there was more), a salmon roll (can't remember the name but it was good) and a rainbow roll. 

Tuna tartare was definitely the best out of the three. Sushi was fresh and service was top notch. The prices reflect the area so unless I'm craving sushi around here, I wouldn't specifically come for Yuzu. That said, everything was good except the price since I can get the speciality rolls for much cheaper than $13-15."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious 2018 and the food was excellent. 

Tuna tartare was out of this world - fresh sashimi topped with a perfect balance of flavour from the garlic ponzu sauce.

Sushi assortment was also fresh but I was underwhelmed by the rolls. The gyu tataki that my partner had was also disappointing. 

Thankfully, dessert saved the day. Both the green tea tiramisu and the sake cheesecake were delicious!

Prices are pretty high so I would say sashimi and dessert are the only parts worthwhile but I probably wouldn't eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The decor was very unassuming, simple and modern, yet retained a traditional finesse.  The fish is properly priced- not too exorbitant.  After many failed attempts at a quality Toronto restaurant, Yuzu No Hana saved my culinary experience.

Presentation : Phenomenal.  Ordered the Yuzu Maki which was literally on fire when brought to our table, and was still flaming away for a few minutes.  The shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado, tobiko combination melted right into our palettes.  The Chirashizushi deluxe was an assortment of sashimi placed on twigs.  It was art on a dish, as it resembled a bird's nest.  

Beyond the obvious care and effort taken for their food to be visually stimulating, the fish was very fresh.  Every piece was a delightful courtship of my taste buds.

I just thought, \"finally, a HIT.\""}
{"text":"Couldn't get an earlier reservation as we decided to eat here last minute
Stopped by the restaurant and fortunately there was a table for our party

sashimi regular - never had sashimi this good before

YUZU maki - this was good, a tad spicier than I would like

YUZU bento - wasn't that great. Never been a fan of bento boxes

Great and quick service."}
{"text":"Good but not my favourite in town, the sashimis are fresh, the signature roll was great"}
{"text":"Had high expectations from the reviews here. Left feeling extremely underwhelmed. We got the uni shooter (not much uni taste), yuzu roll (it was alright), uni, hotate and o-toro nigiri (meh) and the $50 omakase (not worth it at all). Felt like I could just go to an ayce and leave with the same feeling. Apparently they're the same owners as Japango which I enjoyed more. 

They give you boxed uni in the omakase but fresh uni when you order a la carte (which was much better). Overall, I would not return."}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi was fantastic - one of the best in the city. 

Service was poor. Our meals were served at different times and we waited about 30 min for all 4 of us to have our food. They were understaffed and busy packing takeout orders. We had to ask for more tea multiple times and even the desert menu. Don't get the matcha creme brule - it was awful."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've got to say, their fish is the only fish I've had that is comparable to the sushi I've tried in Vancouver. They also carry fish that other places in Toronto don't (such as Hamachi Tail) which is great because those are hard to find. I would recommend getting the Chef's Special combo and order the fish a la carte to share so that you can try a bit of everything. It is not cheap but if you're looking for a change from the typical All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"100% sincerely medriocre sushi for those with money. This is a sweat shop ran sushi restaurant where volume of people passing through is more important then the clients sitting at the table enjoying time. This is a factory style enviroment. Sushi is prepared in advanced,not fresh and if you dont order desert expect the bill to be left on the table as a sign to get up and leave to make wave for the next sucker in line.. NEXT!"}
{"text":"Alright. I admit I don't like to write reviews about good restaurants for fear people will swarm my places. After all, these are my places. I want to come in when I want and be seated, minutes away from nourishment. I want to find my servers as they were, pleasant, not harried by the crowds.

But Yuzu No Hana, your plates send passion coursing through my veins.
I've never had fish that didn't taste absolutely fresh here. Some fish is flown from Japan, Greece and Spain, among other locations, earlier that day. There are garnishments on the rolls that are nice visual and edible touches. There isn't too much going on in terms of dressings, rightfully so given the freshness of the fish, although if you want some spice, you can get a spicy scallop roll, dip it in the sauce trail on the plate and spice the buds off your tongue.

Even the miso soup is superb. While one would think it's hard to mess up a simple dish like miso soup, I have had miso soup that was pretty bland or thin. The miso soup Yuzu No Hana has a nice body, with plumes of miso delighting the eye and slivers of seaweed sliding across the tongue.

One time, per our server's recommendation, we ordered horse mackerel that had arrived that day from Spain. The sushi arrived alongside the skeleton with a wooden skewer running through it, like the fish had been speared in the Mediterranean shortly before showing up on our plate. We savored the sushi. While my dining partners were unsure about whether we were supposed to eat the flesh on the skeleton, I started to remove the skewer and was ready to attack the fish with my mouth, but the waiter came by and said they would fry it up. It returned warm, crispy and not too heavy; even the meat on the head was delectable.

I was less than impressed with the oysters on the half shell, which I've only had once here. Coming from New England, I know there are less expensive and more flavorful oysters out there. But this isn't an oyster place.

Recommendations: 
- Horse mackerel (Spain)
- Grouper (Japan)--my, how fleshy you are, the better to spread the flavor in my mouth
- Yellowtail with scallion roll-- For whatever reason, yellowtail rolls at other sushi restaurants don't tend to be fresh--perhaps because they are not as popular--but they are fresh here.
- Black sesame ice cream--not too sweet, nutty (obviously), smooth

Ugh, delicious! I'm salivating just thinking about it.

Service is usually speedy and they keep the tea aflowing. Out of the several times I've eaten here, only once was I waiting for the food for a long time (30+ minutes for the first bite); however, slow service is endemic to Toronto. It was probably a Friday night fluke, and because the food here is that good, I will keep coming back.

Yuzu, keep it up. You are a gem among the toxic weeds of Toronto. Your sushi is right up there with the sushi I've had in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place. We ordered a sushi lunch special and other sushi items like big-eye tuna, uni, fluke, etc. Overall it was satisfying although the rice is a little dry, so it often fell apart. Interesting thing was that their chef was a lady, which was quite uncommon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, creative sushi, good music and awesome service
One of the main things I like about Yuzu is that they welcomes all customers, provide good service and accommodate your needs. 
The chicken teriyaki and the sushi on fire from Yuzu is something I have never seen before in my sushi life. Very fresh and original. Creativity is a major plus! Fully recommended"}
{"text":"The Yuzu Sushi & Sake Bar is a personable and delightful place to spend an evening. Though the menu is a bit limited, the proprietors have put a great deal of thought into each item they offer. The sake is tremendous! The best I have ever had. The wait staff is attentive and friendly. We never had to wait for service because our wait person was always right there when we needed her. Our meal was wonderful and each dish arrived at the exact, right time.

One of the dishes we tried was the Yuzu Maki Roll and were we ever surprised when the dish arrived at our table - on fire! The fire added to the ambiance of the atmosphere and brought a little extra drama to the meal. The fire burns until you extinguish it, which provided for some entertaining fun.

Some sushi and sake bars feel cramped, with tables close together. We had plenty of room between tables and the environment did not feel at all cramped.

My evening at the Yuzu was one of the best I have ever experienced at a sushi bar. You will not be disappointed when visiting Yuzu for sushi and sake."}
{"text":"Seriously overrated Sushi place. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong but I truly have had better value for the taste elsewhere. I was here the other day a bit after lunch (ten to three). And although the lunch special was still supposed to be going on until three, I wasn't told about it and thus ordered from the regular menu. Other than that service was speedy (considering me being the only guest). 

After some cogitating I picked as opener salmon skin rolls, which usually come crispy and crunchy but these ones were rather chewy and gooey. The main course was decidedly the salmon teriyaki and after asking if it came with sides (I was hungry) I expected something like a bento box selection of goodies, with tempura of some sort, but nope (see picture). The grilled salmon was slightly overcooked, the rice rather sticky and bland instead of fragrant and the side dishes were a pun-less joke (single bites of marinated veggies with half a plumb tomato, not actually ghastly but I felt far too pretentious. I don't remember telling them I was on a diet or anything. 

The place is a tad dunkel with dark wood and interior. 

For the price I expected a bit more although service was quite ok. I may try it again some time to double-check but with so much sushi choice in Toronto it will certainly be a longer than short while."}
{"text":"To be honest one star is a bit harsh, but there's no 1.5 star so I just go with one. 
The reason is the waiter only gave me a regular menu and drink menu, so I ordered the food base on that. When I ordered the sea urchin sushi, he asked Japan or Boston without any explanation. Then the bill came up $25 each instead of $10. I was not informed of the price difference. Plus the sushi is not good at all. The uni is fishy, and small. It's definitely not the good quality. The sushi rice is LOOSE! I also ordered the lobster roll, which is really boring: cooked lobster meat wif Avocado and cucumber, no extra flavor. 

My friend ordered ugani, which is the eel on the rice, she only finished half, saying it not even as good as the one in food court, which is much cheaper.

I also ordered some food for takeout, the waiter put the amount together(dine in+take out), trying to charge me tips for the whole bill. I don't need to pay 15% on takeout food I know that. 

So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came by for an early Christmas dinner and boy was this an amazing way to send her off.  I had ordered the 7 course Yuzu dinner and each course was to die for.  

At first bite, my girlfriend and I knew that we had made an excellent choice for our last dinner date of the year. The salad was perfectly seasoned and topped with seared tuna sashimi. The flavours were unlike any other salad/sashimi I had ever tasted and the clam soup was delicious. 

I wish I wrote this right after the dinner so I can barely remember exactly what I had that night but I do recommend it to everyone and go for the 7 course meal if you can."}

{"text":"The sashimi is great, very fresh and prepared properly. If you had a chance I recommend trying the Yuzu dinner. 

It has a very traditional feel of a sake and sushi bar and is still modern and cute.

This is a good place to go if your looking for fresh sushi and a quiet meal with a friend."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a large group of 10 people and when we arrived they upgraded us to the second floor into a private booth! Food for great, a little on the pricy side for the portion size. It made it up with serving a quality product. Service was on point the entire night with never having to ask for anything.

If portion size for a little bit bigger I would go back without question."}
{"text":"Visiting toronto, we expected great seafood. Being a super sushi snob, we yelped to find the best option in downtown toronto. Yuzu No Hana did not disappoint. 

We ordered the (raw omakaze) for 2 nights in a roll. They have very different offering for the both nights offering the best fish. The size is huge, my boyfriend and I shared one and added some appertizers. 

Note: They have 2 versions of Omakaze - one for \"sushi / sashimi\" and one for cooked food. We didn't try to cooked version, but the raw version was fantastic."}
{"text":"From the winterlicious menu ($28/dinner/pp), we ordered the tuna tartare, and the spicy salmon salad with uni bits. It was alright, but nothing special, very little uni. Then for the entree we had the grilled miso salmon--the portion was small but tasty (make sure you order extra rare). For dessert, the matcha tiramisu was good, but the sake cheesecake was more interesting (but quite strong).

We also ordered the yuzu roll for $15. It was a shrimp tempura roll with a bit of salmon sashimi, torched scallops and some tobiko on top. This was the best part of our dinner! In hindsight, we should have probably ordered from the sushi from winterlicious menu, or the rolls from the regular dinner menu.

The bill in the end came to ~$95. We might come back on special occasions."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the service.  We did not eat however there was a very fishy smell the minute we walked in.  Fish smell in a sushi restaurant...is the fish fresh?  Is it kept at the right temperature?

We had a reservation.  We sat at the bar since a woman in front of us with an incomplete party took our table.  We sat patiently at the sushi bar for more than 10 minutes.  Others around us were greeted with water and a server.  No one spoke to us at all.  We left.  They still didn't say anything.  I suppose there is enough foot traffic in Toronto that there is no need to provide good service (or any service at all).  We are disappointed."}
{"text":"Officially one of my favourite sushi restaurants in Toronto! Everything's so delicious here, from sashimi to desserts. Even the steak tastes amazing. I would recommend this place to all my friends. Price is comparable to other higher end sushi restaurants. $50-$60 per person."}
{"text":"This is where you come for Vancouver quality sushi at Toronto prices.  Portions are small but tasty (as in, tastes fresh) and there is great attention to detail in the presentation of the plates, and even the garnishes are good - but the fact I'm picking at the garnishes reinforces the earlier point about portion size.

I think Yuzu hits the sweet spot.  Much better than the cheap, filling but lower quality stuff-you-eat-as-a-student that you get at say, Sushi on Bloor or New Gen but cheaper and just as good as Ki, but without the fancy decor and stylings and more authentically Japanese.

All in all, I recommend."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try out this place for a while. So when an opportunity came up to try this coveted spot for sushi/sashimi we jumped upon it.  The funny thing is this happened to be the eve for Halloween and we were thinking we would be out of place since we were dressed in costumes and all.  Our fears were washed away as we were greeted enthusiastically by the the staff and even the sushi chef came out to greet us at the table phew what a relief.
We were starving so we decided to order a medley of food.
Starters were agedashi tofu, wakame salad with a bonus California roll thrown in for good measure.  2 of our mains also came with miso soup.
For the main we ordered Gindara, Vegetable Soba, Sashimi Deluxe. For drinks a glass of Pinot Grigio, Asahi and Asahi Black.
The food arrived promptly. The California Roll was the lone standout, with the wakame salad and agedashi tofu being visually appealing and average in taste. Miso soup was run of the mill stuff, why oh why restaurants make this soup so weak.
The mains arrived afterwards and our first impression was the serving is on small side with gindara being a tiny portion. Vegetable Soba came in big bowl and looked decent. Friend liked her Gindara while the other friend found the soba to be nothing special.
The sashimi deluxe was visually appealing with a very nice combo of colors and condiments. Unfortunately the wasabi is not the real deal and is the artificially flavored and color variety a misstep IMO at this price point. I didn't bring my stash of real wasabi with me for this dinner (yes I am one of those people who bring their own wasabi to restaurants) Some of the sashimi was of very high quality especially the white fish. 
Still unfulfilled we decided to order a spicy tuna and spicy salmon hand roll. Spicy tuna had a good amount of kick in the end which was appreciated by moi (I like my tuna roll spicy like George likes his kung pao spicy)
We closed the meal with scoop of black sesame ice cream. 
The cost per head is on the high side as we hadn't even touched their sake selection so if we do the cost benefit analysis I found this place to be good not great. 
3 Stars."}
{"text":"Love it!!!!! So fresh and yummy. Good service for a sushi restaurant. Try the Yuzu house roll. Different lunch and dinner menu. Good Saparo on tap. My current fav Sushi spot. I make the trip from Markham on a regular basis.  The atmosphere is also great."}
{"text":"even when i hear about all the \"you really oughta go!\" restaurants that toronto offers, i always, always prefer to go to my favourites. yuzu is a favourite, where i happily dine at least once a month (maybe more). 
i really enjoy the chirashi and hae dup bap when i'm hungry, and sashil/sushi are good for when i need to feel light. this isn't often about relative portion size, it's because yuzu chefs provide a delicious butter sauce that i like to use with hot foods, which packs a punch in terms of flavour and heft in your belly. 
i'd like to see a wider selection of wine by the glass because my companions usually don't drink (can't share a bottle) or have sake (which i don't drink). 
the service is almost always fantastic and i love that it's not so highly frequented in the evening since that's usually when i can go. it stays quiet and perfect for convo. lunch time is another story though. be forewarned, you may not find a seat during the typical work week lunch hour.
as you may know, yuzu is related to japango. though it's not on the menu, you can order japango rolls at yuzu too!"}
{"text":"The rolls were great. A friend and I decided to share edamame beans, tempura, and 4 rolls: spicy crunchy tuna, Spider, Salmon skin, and California. We received a good amount for the price as well."}

You can do better Yuzu no hana!"}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 3 for a birthday dinner and I was quite disappointed by the quality of the food. We didn't reserve in time so we couldn't order the $100 omakases. However, we ordered the Sushi and Sashimi Moriawase, Sushi Omakase, and Dinaa. Out of the 3, the Dinaa was most not worth the money at all. With the price of $70, we felt like we were eating a dinner set that we could easily have for $30 at a lower end sushi restaurant. They didn't have many special fish as their chef's selection, just the typical ones. For dessert, I did enjoyed their sesame ice cream, it was very rich. Also, our waitress was not that attentive. It was so difficult to get her attention. Would I come back? Probably not - but it was ok to try it once."}
{"text":"Very good Sushi, lots of selections and the service was the best, I will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"huge fan for almost 3 years. there green tea cheese cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"One of my fav sushi place! The fishes were super fresh and the chef was very kind explaining what each piece of sushi was and where it came from."}
{"text":"Chose this place for our Winterlicious due to its high rating, but so disappointed!

We 4 people ordered 4 tuna tartare as starter, 2 tataki and 2 sushi set for main dish, 2 cheese cake and 2 green tea tiramisu for dessert. 

Only the starter was alright, the mains and desserts were however so pathetic...The 2 beef dishes were even smaller than the starters, all better to call them, samplers... Let alone the sushi sets, despite of the poor presentation, fish were soggy and rice were hard and dry.

Then here came the desserts. Tiramisu cakes were soaking and you could see the gree-coloured water underneath. Gross. Cheesecake, we believed that it was one of the 24 slices from one cake.

I usually just have tiny bites for dinner, but this time we ordered takeout somewhere else after leaving this place...Poor quality, poor portion, poor presentation - this is my review.

If you decided to join the game you'd better play well, or at least try to play well. Don't abuse your reputation - although I wonder how could you be ranked so high given such an awful dining experience."}
{"text":"I ordered: Sushi Deluxe, Oyster shooter, and Otoro Sashimi
My friend ordered: King Salmon Sashimi, Blue Fin Tuna Sashmi (maguro cut), and Yuzu Roll.

Sushi Deluxe: A decent set with a good variety of fish at a good price. However, the spicy dynamite roll combination with the sushi set felt a bit weird. Nothing wrong with the roll itself--it was a good roll. However, it just felt like it didn't go well with the nigiri. It's just a personal thing. The rice was excellent. Good texture and temperature. 8.5/10.

Oyster shooter: When I ordered it, I expected that the oyster shooter would have uni because I was look at all the pictures on yelp before coming here. However, when it came, I noticed that it didn't have any uni. I didn't think much of it, and then I had it. It was all right, but it felt lacking without the uni.

Then I took a look at the menu. On the menu, it said the oyster shooter comes with \"fresh oyster, quail egg, tobiko, yuzu ponzu, uni, green onion.\" I only noticed that after we've paid the bill. I decided to ask the server. She said she will ask the chef. At first, the server said they're not sure what happened, but they're going to make me a new one. I didn't expect them to do so, and I thought that was great of them. However, they ended up only serving me the missing uni on the side. I don't blame the server for saying they'll make me a new one and then only serving me the uni--there was probably just a miscommunication between her and the chef. It was great that they tried to rectify it, but serving the uni on the side is quite different from having it in the shooter all together. 6.5/10. Would likely be higher if it had been all together.

Otoro Sashimi: 3 slices for $25. Kinda pricey! But great texture and great portion size (as it ought to be). In terms of quality, the ones I had at Yazu and Jabistro (though those ones were sushi) might have been a bit better. 8.5/10

Yuzu roll: Great tasting roll with a nice flaming presentation. Again, the rice was excellent.

King Salmon Sashimi: My friend said it was good (I haven't tried). 

Blue Fin Tuna Sashimi (Hon Maguro on the menu): My friend liked it. One of the pieces looked so fatty that it's almost like toro.

My friend says for the two sashimi he ordered: good size, good presentation, good taste, no crumbs (inside joke haha). 8.5/10.

Services: Excellent service in general (speed of food, tea refills, rectifying that oyster shooter). 9/10

Other comments: Could use more items on their menu (ankimo for one). But I'm surprised that they have calpico (or calpis) in their beverage menu. Nice!

Conclusion: Great sushi, but not a lot of wow factor (Yasu's kind of a hard act to follow). I would try again but possibly not for a while since I have many other Japanese restaurants on my list that I need to try (Japango, Zen Markham, etc).

Quality: 8.5/10. Value: 8/10. Service: 9/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great -- almost consistently. You can get some really high quality items for an appropriate price. I've been going here for over two years, and have really only had a lunch or two that missed the mark in terms of preparation and quality. The service is always fast, friendly and efficient. The lunch crowd during the week consists mostly of business-types. Evenings and weekends are usually 20-30-somethings. Yuzu is completely devoid of douchebag hipsters and invading Mississauguans seeking a pre-club meal. I just really like it here. 

Recently, we sat next to a table consisting of two adult men who were deeply engrossed in the logistics and strategies of what I assume must have been Warcraft for their entire meal. They spoke about their quests with the utmost sincerity and passion. Your meal here will likely not be as riveting as mine was.

If you're lucky enough to sit in the dining area which is closest to the front entrance, you're in for a treat. And by \"treat\", I mean a solitary framed picture of a C-list celebrity, hung in the centre of a wall as a focal point. This otherwise tastefully decorated dining establishment has a single black and white headshot of Adrian Brody. Did he eat there? Will more celebrity headshots be added to the wall at some point? It's been a considerable period of time since he appeared, and yet only Mr. Brody remains. He's so serious, looking out at the diners with those doleful eyes and prominent nose that an Afghan hound would be proud to possess. 

To say that Adrian Brody has become an integral part of my dining experience at Yuzu No Hana would be the understatement of the century."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night. It was really quiet. The service was great. The server was casual and helpful. The Sake selection is pretty good. We focused on sashimi with some grilled black code and soft-shell crab. Everything was good. As with most sushi restaurants (almost all now?) I wonder how cold (or frozen) the fish has been over it's travel from wherever to Toronto. But the fish was tasty and nicely cut. We also did uni and quail eggs and those were very nice. The black cod was great. I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"This is a nice surprise amidst the theatre district. The food was beautifully presented and the service was attentive but no intrusive. We had the sashima as an appetizer and it was one of the freshest fish I've ever had. The black miso cod was delicious."}
{"text":"We showed up for our 5:30 reservation and it was very apparent the only waitress was extremely overwhelmed. Over time, more servers arrived but we didn't get our drinks until a solid 30 minutes later. One waiter practically accused us of not knowing what we ordered and had completely missed a roll. 
The presentation was impressive and the food was good. The service really brought down the experience."}
{"text":"Although a little expensive, this was one of the best chirashi experiences i've had! The restaurant is a small but classy joint with dim lighting to set the mood. Picked a bar seat to watch the sushi chefs work their magic in front of us. 

Salmon roll - picked this as a basic level setting appetizer and was amazed by how deliciously unique a very standard salmon roll tasted at this place. The salmon melts on your tongue. 

Crunchy crab appetizer - the crab was soft shelled so everything was edible. It was breaded with a beady texture. Decent, but nothing spectacular. 

Oyster shooter - if i could give this a 10 out of 5 stars, I would. Each shot was very precisely crafted with a plump oyster, uni, raw quail egg, caviar, and some garnishing. The combination was a very savory, delicious taste that left you wanting more.

Chirashi - we went with the deluxe chirashi and everything about this dish was fantastic. Even the rice tasted much better than normal. All the fish was fresh and soft and it also came with uni. 

Would definitely recommend. If your wallet can afford it."}
{"text":"The uni was perfect; fresh, creamy, delicious. My girlfriend was in total ecstasy. The seared butterfish was excellent. They were out of ikura so we will have to go back. Great atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner.

We started off with the asari sakamushi (manila, yuzu, sake, clam soup). The broth was nice and refreshing with a lovely clam taste. A good way to start the meal. I also enjoyed the shimeji mushrooms that were in the soup. We also ordered the soft shelled crab. The rice batter was fun, crispy, and the tiny balls give the crab a really unique and interesting texture. The actual crab itself didn't have as much flavour.

I enjoyed the sushi and sashimi more than the appetizers. For main we got sashimi. The different types of fish (chef's choice) we were served was fresh and high quality. The fish was cut very nicely and presentation was very pretty.

We also had the ika nigiri (squid on rice), which was amazing. The squid was the best that I have tried raw. The texture of the squid was not chewy or fishy.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. If you are looking for high end sushi this is a great place to come."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy Yuzu no hana, who is known to be the sister restaurant of Japango. The ambiance is great and staffs are generally quite friendly.

Tonight ended up being a disappointment. The menu has changed, and prices have raised. The food quality is so much lower...

My friend ordered salmon teriyaki, which she used to enjoy a lot at Yuzu. Today, it ended up being two small dry pieces that came in a bento box choice only. ($30: two small pieces of salmon, sashimi, 4 nigiri, tempura [lots of veggie, two skinny and tiny shrimp], miso soup and side raddishes)

The sushi, which use to be at the standard of Japango, tasted like the level of any sushi restaurant on Yonge street. 

Either they lost the original kitchen team, or the owner has changed. Looks like tonight ended up being my last time here...(at least the servers were polite)"}
{"text":"I must agree with the three star reviews. The food is ok but not amazing. The waiter made a couple of mistakes and then argued with me that I ordered Siemens else. He turned around at the end of the evening but I wouldn't go back. The food was reasonably priced though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and dinner, and was impressed with the food quality for both times. I'm not usually the type to go to Japanese restaurants purely for the sushi rolls but the taste and quality here was superb!

On a cold winter day, the seafood bowl on rice is excellent for those who want a filling and warm meal. Their sashimi selection is also fresh and reasonably priced.

For sweet tooths, I recommend the matcha creme brulee, it is fantastic, you gotta try it for yourself to see!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for my team - working dinner. I'd like to come back for a sit down meal - the sushi was fresh and decently priced. Sake, butter fish, hamachi, uni, ikura, toro, all fresh. Sad they didn't have the Aji - either they ran out or it wasn't fresh today.

Surprised that in all 75 reviews, only one mentioned the wasabi - fantastic. much better than the generic powder/paste that most restaurants will use. fresh wasabi makes it even more enjoyable. We're fans!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for Summerlicious Dinner. 
The appetizers were Nanban and Salad. The Nanban was a cold cooked fish but had extremely small portion. The salad had full of arugula, and only few tofu. The flavor of arugula was too strong. 

We both ordered the salad as the second dish, and that was the worst part of the dinner.The three tempura rolls were okay.  The sashimi were not fresh at all and tasted all the same. When we bit it felt like we were eating slime..The texture of the sashimi was horrible. We felt like vomit when we were eating..

The last dish was cheesecake. It did not taste like a dessert for summer cuz it did not have any fresh flavor.. The over-sweet, hard cake made us even more uncomfortable.

When we got home we both vomitted. We will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend last week and I was pretty impressed.

The food was excellent overall.  I had the bento box that came with rice, tempura, sushi, sashimi, and your choice of meat (I had teriyaki chicken).  The sushi and sashimi were very fresh and flavorful.  Excellent quality.
I really enjoyed the shrimp tempura.  The batter was very flaky and the shrimp was fresh and juicy.  Not dried out like most other places.

The service was also very professional and friendly.

Everything about this restaurant is in line with an upper scale Japanese restaurant.  I found the bento box a bit pricey ($30) but you get what you pay for.

Highly recommend if you're willing to spend a little more."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered 4 maki rolls, a tempura appetizer and two desserts. Found the menu selection a bit basic; many other Japanese restaurants have tried to be creative with their offerings but the menu seems to be in a rut here. Service was fine, although the music was a bit loud for my taste. Food quality was average vs other Japanese restaurants I've visited in Toronto. The green tea tiramisu was nice and light and a bit of a change. Nothing here to make me go out of my way for a return visit."}
{"text":"I totally agree with bike j. This is so far the best sushi restaurant in toronto way better then, ki, blowfish, or Wabora by far, it's not even close. 

The please is modest yet traditional, the service is excellent, but the sushi is the main attraction! 

The best server is Rio (pronounced Leo with a soft \"l\") he is by far the best we have experienced at any restaurant in toronto. 

Our favorite dish is the \"sushi deluxe\" it's a delight of melt in your mouth 12pc nigiri and 6pc maki all super fresh and tasty. (we ask them to hold the raw shrimp, not an allergy just a personal taste thing, I like my raw shrimp in a cocktail with a lot of horseradish sauce, not a big fan of sushi shrimp) that said we love he tempura in the maki. 

We add salmon avocado hand rolls, uni sashimi, and ikura sashimi. 

The California cab they have is great as well (comes by the 1/2 bottle or bottle) 

Omakase is unbelievable! You will have to book minimum of 24 hrs in advance bc they custom order the fish specifically for those that booked Omakase. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed by our experience at Yuzu No Hana. We made a reservation to have dinner before going to see a play at the nearby Royal Alexandra Theatre. We chose Yuzu No Hana based on the Yelp reviews and photos. Seated immediately -- the restaurant was really quiet and empty for 6pm. Unfortunately, despite being seated at the first table as you walk in, the staff ignored/forgot us for about 15-20 minutes. Other diners arrived and had drinks ordered and delivered before us. The food was okay, but overpriced. The final strike was after dinner when I went downstairs to use the restroom. Neither stall door closed -- really? -- and there were no paper towels. Completely unimpressed with the entire experience. Would not return or recommend. Too many better places in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We decided on Yuzu No Hana because we didn't feel like going to a national chain restaurant and needed something open on Sunday night for dinner because we were going to TIFF.  I was extremely pleasantly surprised!  The portions do seem a bit small, but that is by North American standards.  The portion size is definitely in line with that I saw when I was in Japan.  Sorry, no pics, my phone died before dinner even started.    The quality of the sushi was absolutely divine!  Each piece was very fresh and flavourful. Didn't have enough time for dessert, but I will definitely go back to try out more stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"This is by far....hands down...no doubt the best Sushi place in Toronto.  If you are looking for fresh, authentic, and real Sushi then come to Yuzonohana.  However...make sure you bring your wallet because a place THIS good you will surely have to pay for.... But it is worth every penny!

I went on valentines day and they had set menus.  We had an 8 course meal full of sushi, salad, and some amazing lamb.  Every single dish was well presented and tasted even better than it looked!

The service was amazing and we sat at the Sushi Bar so we could see the chefs preparing our food. You can tell they care about their product and do not take any short cuts.

Go here if you want to Splurge on Sushi.  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to surprise me! Their seafood is so fresh and the rice is cooked to perfection. Words cannot explain the flavor combinations at Yuzu no Hana.

I recommend the Uni, Ikura sushi, and the chef's selection of sashimi."}
{"text":"Good quality sashimi and sushi. Unfortunately the service is hit or miss......especially considering their prices."}
{"text":"Great attentive service despite the packed theatre crowd.   Particularly enjoyed the Yuzu role which arrived on a flaming plate.
Brought two teenage kids.  While it isn't exactly 'kid friendly' they were welcomed, and enjoyed their first challenging taste of uni.

Thanks for the great service, and quality sushi!"}
{"text":"serves the best sashimi in toronto. the sashimi is very fresh and tasty. order from the daily specials menu, you wont regret it. 
food is pricy but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Bad Service. Excellent food. Too bad the service was horrible. Because the service was so bad, I even downloaded this app, made an account and am writing this review because it was that bad. The waiter was rude as ****. Here is why. When my friends and I were ready to order, we called the waiter over and he told us to wait so we waited. It turns out he was getting the card machine for the table next to us. After he gave the card machine to the table next to us, I asked him again because now I had a question about the menu and he responded to I told you to wait. I was shocked because I had a question and he was just standing there waiting for the person at the other table to be done with the card machine. In all honesty, I had a question about how many pieces the sashimi and sushi was. So my friends and I waited until he came over. When he came over, I asked him how many pieces the sushi and sashimi came in he told us. Knowing that the sushi came in two pieces and sashimi came in three pieces, i momentarily asked my friends to clarify what we wanted - it was less than 10 seconds - and the waiter told us to call him when we were ready and he chucked his notepad at the bar table (which was right infront of our table). The tone he was using was unbelievably rude, disrespectful and discourteous. I was shocked that he had the audacity to treat us perhaps because we were just some university kids and were not grown ups which does not mean the waiter could treat us that way. It was ridiculous. Not only that when it came down to the bill, when I was in mid sentence to telling him that we were going to split two ways, he took off who knows where when the restaurant was empty. I was absolutely shocked. There were so many other things I would have tried but because of the terrible service my hunger ceased immediately. For a high end restaurant, to have such a rude server was just very sad and disappointing. Compared to Jabistro, Jabistro's service and food were on par. However, this restaurant was just too disappointing."}
{"text":"Can't compare Yuzu to any other Sushi places in Toronto, as this is the only one I've been to, but compared to SF or NY, the sushi is just average.  The rolls lacked flavor and the sashimi was cut too thick.  Service was great, though."}
{"text":"Alright place. Personally prefer jabistro more, flaming sushi roll was pretty impressive though ."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just there on an off night...I was excited by the reviews of this place. But I ordered some sashimi o-toro for $25 and it was the worst I have ever tasted! The salmon, eel and aji were fine but I actually had to spit the o-toro out on my plate...I have never ever done that with o-toro...its my fav!!! When you touched it with the chopstick it was hard, it looked like bacon more than o-toro...so I told the waiter, he spoke to the chef and they said it was the best they could do. Oh, before that they gave me free edamame which were quite over done and inedible too...ok, i know what you are thinking...this guy is just a picky eater...Im not! And the restaurant did not remove it from my bill (oh, and did I mention I left over 50% on plate untouched? And I only ordered like 9 pieces for dinner?) and I didnt complain they charged me for it. I told him my company would pay it, Im on business but you should not sell and serve that fish. He said they would take it under consideration and then I left, full bill paid...but I will never ever ever ever ever go back. Oh, they offered me free desert but after the edamame, I turned it down."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The ambiance, the service, the food...
We had two orders of the Yuzu roll, served with flames all around it.  Tastes out of this world!"}
{"text":"A great sushi restaurant.  I wanted the omakase but apparently they require a reservation at least 3 days prior.  I got the sashimi deluxe and presentation earned them 5 stars.  Definitely fresh ingredients.  And they use fresh wasabi which is a big plus for me.

Service is very subpar though.  They didn't explain what fish I am getting and took forever with everything.  We wait almost 45 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Toronto. Great atmosphere, wonderful service, delicious saki, and the Yuzu roll is amazing. 

The seaweed salad also gets an honorable mention, as the addition of coriander sprouts is BRILLIANT and adds a whole new dimension to an old favorite."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good! Their Yazo Speciality Roll was the best! Their oysters were ok, not as great as a few other places. In the end had their black sesame ice cream and that was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"OH EM GEE yummy! My boyfriend first brought me here for Valentine's last year and we've splurged on dinners here maybe 7 times now. My boyfriend didn't even care for sushi until this place... now he's hooked on sushi too, like me - thank you Yuzu! I always get the bento box dinner and my boyfriend loves the sushi deluxe. 

The fish is so fresh and they taste so superb - almost like they've infused more flavor into the fish or something! Every bite is an explosion of flavor and you just want to take your time chewing the fish because you wish you could hold onto the taste forever.

We also usually get one or two appetizers as well like agedashi tofu or oyster shooters. And their matcha creme brulee is always perfect sweetness and delicious. No dish has disappointed us so far. 

Service has always been friendly and adequate. 

Our favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4
Service-5
Food-5
Strikeouts-0/3

Yuzu No hana was the place I was saving for a great date. The pictures and the reviews looked promising and had several friends give the thumbs up!

Decor wise, it looked upscale, modern and  had a slight Japanese feel. If I got a front row seat with the sushi chefs, that would have been great, but we just got a regular table with minimal lighting (bad for foodie pics lol).

Service, I'll keep it short, it was quick and accurate, but there's not much communication between the chefs and wait staff to give coherent descriptions of the food. We got the omakase (booked one day ahead) so it was mostly exclusively off menu items. 

Off the to main part of the review! Total experience I would have to be said to be compared to the famous Japanese restaurant \"Nobu\". It has the same menu style, and presentation. Modern, but retains the Japanese taste. In order, this is what I got...
Oyster shooter with uni

Appetizer. 
Three Scallops with special cheese sauce
Deep fried shrimp salsa with mayo mustard
Traditional Japanese veggies: pumpkin, beans, carrots, radish, and a tomato

Sashimi: Blue fin tuna belly,Sea bream, Bonito, and Horse mackerel

Soup: Matsutake mushroom shrimp, mizuna cod with lotus root 

Ishiyaki stone with Kobe beef (ponzu sauce and sesame sauce)

Grilled fish: Shishito pepper miso Salmon radish root

Nigiri: Bluefin tuna, Spanish mackerel, Squid, and Uni(very rare to see Uni this way...)

Green tea tiramisu (strawberry jam, Apple stick)

My top favourite dish was the scallops with the special cheese sauce. The blue fin tuna nigiri was much better than the sashimi and puts this restaurant on the top of my list. It's easily comparable to the top sushi restaurants in Japan in terms of caliber. Maybe I just got lucky with my piece, but it was divine!!

My experience may be biased since I got the omakase, but it was definitely worth it. I came out as happy as I did coming out of sushi KAJI. Definitely top 1 or 2 sushi places in Toronto. Definitely can't compare KAJI and Yuzu no Hana since they cater to two different crowds despite being both Japanese. 

Come reserve and order the omakase!! All the other tables will be staring and be jealous =)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi in the city.  It's got a great atmosphere (low light), feels roomy, and great service on top of all that.  The selection on the menu from Sashimi, Tempura, and Sushi is all fresh and taste great.  It has unique things on the menu that I haven't typically seen at other sushi restaurants.

You are paying a bit of a premium when eating at a sushi restaurant like this, but it's honestly the price is justified by the freshness of the food and kind service.

Check this place out if you are ever downtown and craving some fresh top quality sushi!"}
{"text":"We went here for a special belated bday lunch date...the atmosphere was amazing. The restaurant was very business chic and transitioned to classy date intimate for the evening. The feel was contemporary and spacious. I loved the decor and the sushi bar was definitely the pinnacle of the restaurant. The sushi chef was friendly and greeted us with a warm smile and polite nod. The price point was of the fine dining class for sure. We intended to go for the omakase at first but ended up ordering the sashimi and sushi platter to get a wider range of what we know we wanted to try. We also ordered the yuzu rolls to try their maki as well. For two people, that was plenty of food (actually a bit of a struggle to finish to be completely honest). In fact, we had to skip desserts. The meal started of as many sushi places do with miso and salad. For the most part, people wouldn't consider rating this portion of the meal...but if you're paying about $40 per person for lunch, I'll have high expectations (stringently) for each component of the meal. The miso was well prepared and perfectly balanced. The miso and tea provided us relief from the bitter cold outdoors-greatly appreciated. I took issue with the salad however. Looking into the bowl, the quality was lacking in comparison with most ayce sushi places (which is unacceptable)...there were wilted leaves as well as mushy dirty leaves. After we asked to get both changed, the 'new salad' was slightly in better shape-still wilted and pathetic looking (although the sad thing was, the dressing was very good...only if the veg matched the quality). I won't hide my disappointment for this oversight, as it did take away from the overall experience. Our excitement returned as the waiter approached with our platters. The platters elegantly showcased the precious morsels of food. The sashimi platter came with a bowl of rice. At our request, the waiter did go through the offerings but I had a hard time hearing his quiet voice and remembering. The highlight for me was the white fishes like the hamachi, butter fish and albacore tuna...also an unidentified fatty piece of sashimi that was amazing (especially when I made the choice to pair it with the shiso leaf). The ingredients were notably fresh and perfectly temperate. The rice on the sushi was well prepared and although my bf didn't like the wasabi in the sushi (he found it too much and over powering), I found I had to add slightly a bit more for my taste (personal preference on that factor though). The rice for sashimi platter was the same as the sushi but slightly a bit drier which was understandable. The wasabi itself had a different sweeter note then most and the kick is a bit weaker which was pleasant in its own rights. The yuzu roll was definitely an impressive dish. The presentation was top notch...memorizing diners with a small fire show and a deliciously put together maki roll. Unlike many maki rolls, the sauces complimented the dish rather than smothered or overpowered the ingredients. The cooked and raw seafood was a nice balance in taste and texture, and the complementary ingredients such as the tobiko and the avocado added a nice dimension. The meal was overly sufficient for two (someone left with a slight upset tummy...ahem). We left full and wanting to come back for other offerings on a later date, hopefully the salads won't be as pathetic the second or third time around I would greatly hope. I would not hesitate recommending this place, minus the salad, to sushi connoisseurs, foodies or business professionals looking for a dining experience for meetings (once again minus the salad)...yes I am VERY fixated on that...even when i absolutely lobe the rest of the meal. Thank you to my wonderful bf for the exquisite dining experiences...hope there's many more to come ;p. Give it a try if you want a a la carte experience and willing to splurge a bit for quality rather than quantity."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this Winterlicious 2018 menu and experience!

A $33 dinner for a minuscule (though tasty) tuna tartare, 8 sushi pieces and ice cream? I expected more from Yuzu No Hana. The food was alright, the service just \"meh\". Our order was delayed and out of sync. Our waiter(s) confused and disorganized. The room upstairs cold and uninviting.

We won't be returning for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"I came with high hopes because of all the great reviews but walked away disappointed. Service was so-so - not poor, but they were not super attentive either.

To be honest, the food was not bad, but for the price I definitely expected more than a run-of-the-mill Japanese take out joint. 

I didn't hate the place, but I probably wouldn't come back due to how mediocre my visit was."}
{"text":"Descent omakase. Some of the pieces were ok. The pricing was good   

They have Otoro and it's pretty good. 

The chef came out and introduced himself which was cool.  I ask a lot questions on sushi and my waiter was new but the chef was very knowledgable.  

Not the best sushi spot in the city. But likely the best value spot."}
{"text":"Firstly the restaurant is spacious which is great. They offer an extensive selection of fish and their menu remains simple which is a good thing.

Firstly as a function of location, quality of fish etc the prices are high. Given sushi is expensive to being with this place is on the higher side though still reasonable.

Their major downfall is that their rice is not prepared properly.  I was really hoping i had just visited on off-days but after having been 3 times within 3 weeks I feel my opinion is probably fair and tested. The rice was very much under seasoned. People often argue that sushi is about balance and so rice need not be seasoned too heavily. This is true, however those who know sushi will realize there is such thing as under seasoned. On 2 other occasions the rice was actually hard. 

Secondly their seafood is fresh but the quality does not compare to other places such as Zen. As an example, their scallops were fresh but had little to no sweetness. As the chef, having tasted this I would not have served it to my customers.

Overall the seafood is fresh but not the highest quality as is evident but the lack of richness or general flavor. But the largest downfall is that they do not prepare rice properly which simply ruins the meal.

I would not visit here because for what you get it really isnt worth the money."}
{"text":"Sit at the sushi bar,  enjoy Chef/Owner Bruce's genuine hospitality along with some of the tastiest sushi in Toronto.    BC Albacore, Hamachi sashimi, madai,  seared butter fish and the occasional horse mackerel.   Delicious."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner and enjoyed all of them. Their grilled cod is small but tasty and the chefs chirashi comes in a fancy presentation with fresh sashimi. The place is a bit small and wish the seats a little more apart."}
{"text":"My hunt for a decent local sushi place was finally rewarded when I stumbled across Yuzu. One of the few genuinely good Japanese joints in Toronto. Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We ordered the sashimi Delux and it was very fresh and tasty. The tempura was small but very good too, and we got the tuna spicy roll and the Dragon roll, I really liked them, but my favorite was the Dragon roll. 
I tried a martini with lychee, pomegranateand and sake at it was very good. We tried creme brule (without green tea), that was ok. 
Service was very good too. 
Overall nice choice!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Ordered the Omakase, was so fresh that I could taste the Ocean. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Impromptu dinner. This is modernized jap/Korean/bar type of setting. We were surprised to be able to get a reservation at last minute through yelp. 

The inside is dark, ambience is more the typical steakhouse than traditional jap/Korean restaurants. Very elegantly done.

The food is a bit on the pricy side but the large servings and flavour more than made up for it. I was excited to order the gyu tartar bowl, which is kinda like a bibimbap with yukhoe (minced marinated raw beef), as there are not many places that serve yukhoe. While this main dish is fantastic in its own right, I quickly found that the minced beef got cooked quickly in the hot stoneware, which defeats the experience of yukhoe.  I suppose I should have thought about that before I order lol.

The service was nice but a bit slow."}
{"text":"Fantastic rolls, the combination of pepper and sweetener is brilliant! The sashimi is very fresh with awesome wasabi and soy sauce!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Especially enjoyed the garnishes on the nigri -- something I haven't seen in many places."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for service but 4 for atmosphere and quality of most of the food. 

Order (for 2): oysters on the half, tuna seared on salad, age dashi tofu, yuzo roll, yam roll and namuil roll.

The negative: Given the stunning atmosphere of the restaurant we were surprised to get the rush treatment, and a little disappointed our server did not bringing out our order in courses as we had asked. We had specifically asked to start with certain menu selections so we could have a leisurely dinner but it all came out haphazardly and so fast so that there was no room to have our drinks on our table. Speaking g of drinks... Impressive sake menu bit no wine by the glass on the drink menu.

The positive: The chefs were accommodating, adjusting my friend's order to be vegan and the presentation of the signature roll was amazing (fire!) As it was for the oysters (DELICIOUS) and the salad. 

I dont believe I would go back as it wasn't quite as high end as I was looking for but I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for good sushi. The fish was fresh, the rice was lovely and those oysters! #nom"}
{"text":"Yuzu is a lovely Japanese restaurant nestled in a small space in downtown Toronto.  The atmosphere is serene and calm, the service is everything I love about Japanese culture.  We started with a delicious miso soup, hot enough to take away the winter chill.  

We sat at the bar and watched the sushi masters, which, to me, is the perfect evening entertainment.  We had the salmon and green onion roll and spicy tuna roll.  Both were fresh and appealing.  My husband had the sashimi platter, and came out as a beautiful work of art.  I'm really going to have to photograph our meals from now on!  I had the Wafu beef with a red wine teriyaki sauce.  The plate was well composed and beautiful, with lovely knife-worked vegetables surrounding the tender, succulent meat."}
{"text":"First time diner here. 

We had:
- Soft shell crab sushi roll
- Yuzu roll - signature roll. Can't remember everything in it but it was great
- Gyoza
- Scallops
- glass of wine and a beer. 

Total came to $68 + tip. 
All the food was really good, and the service was good too. 

We had a celebrity sighting sitting next to John Lithgow, so that was fun haha.

Nice ambience and good looking place as well."}
{"text":"The meal was based on the chef's selections where we got to sample a series of smaller dishes. Overall, the dinner, experience, and service was well-done and our waitress was extremely attentive and knowledgeable of the dishes. There was a lot of thought put into the dishes and some things were more tastier than others. However, I can't exactly say there was anything that made the restaurant stand out imo, in comparison to other higher-scale sushi restaurants. 

There was one roll where the plate was set on fire. While it was a novelty experience, the roll itself wouldn't really warrant a second purchase, imo. 

Would go back if wallet permits! 8/10"}
{"text":"Can we please give a moment of appreciation for how soft, flavourful, and rich the bluefin belly, \"o-toro\" is? 

Ah. 

Drooling. 

To this day, I don't think I've had better sashimi. It's on the expensive side, but totally worth the spurge on those special occasions. Also loved the gindara, aka broiled black cod with sweet miso glaze and green tea tiramisu."}
{"text":"Yuzu no Hana is a solid choice for good tasting sushi at somewhat reasonable prices. I've been here a few times and it has a nice ambiance that isn't overly pretentious. 

To start off, we had some appetizers. The scallops with shimeji mushrooms are fantastic. They're really rich and savoury. We also had the pork belly which was a bit salty but pretty tasty. 

For my main, I had the chef's selection of sushi which featured an assortment of cuts. Nothing mind blowing but it was solid.  It included the basics such as tuna and salmon nigiri. The rolls were standard as well. 

Overall, it's a decent sushi joint if you're in the Entertainment District."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with their menu variety. Quality and portions were good as well! What sushi restaurant do you know that offers black cod bento box? Good alternative to Jabistro for lunch."}
{"text":"I went here for the first dinner seating on a Sunday and luckily we were seated right away because I was starving. It was pretty empty for a Sunday evening. I ordered their oyster shooter just because I love raw oysters. But for my 7 dollar shot, it was a quick tasting and then gone... I think I'll just skip the appetizers and go straight for sushi next time. I also order the tuna tartare but wasn't impressed. It was chopped in such large chunks and threw some avocado into the mix. I didn't think it was amazing flavors or texture didn't go well together. Not what I had in mind. 
I enjoyed the presentation of the yuzu maki. It came on a flaming plate. It was great. But next time I need anything flamed, I think I'll just keep going back to jabistro. 
The sushi deluxe was also great to share between two people. 
We ordered the seafood bowl.... I think I was just enjoying the rice more than the seafood component... Cuz I love burnt rice. 
Overall.... Sushi is good size... Bigger sashimi with small bed of rice which I like. Rolls were deliciously made."}
{"text":"So you have to make sure you make it there before 5.30. Im a self proclaimed sushi snob and i think this is one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto. Sushi/sashimi are always very fresh. Yuzu is also one of the few restaurants that serves tobigo and quail egg sashimi. That being said it gets extremely busy and service suffers."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff, delicious fresh sushi, and tasty Japanese standards. What more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Despite having an option for yelp and open table reservations at 10pm on Fridays, we were turned away at 10pm on a Friday. We didn't have a reservation but the place was nearly empty and the sign on their door noted they closed at 11pm. We just wanted a super quick bite, a roll each but the hostess just kept shaking her head at us and saying \"Closed\". But they obviously weren't closed! It was kind of upsetting but was mitigated by the fact that we then tried out Fune Sushi just down the street that was AMAZING and so cool with the sushi moat! So I guess thank you Yuzu, for turning us away an hour before closing so that we could end up somewhere better ;)"}
{"text":"i loved everything here... great fresh sashimi, perfect texture and temperature, sushi didn't have so much rice on them, didn't kill any rolls with douching in sauce.. drinks were good, service was above average, but not top notch...
i think they have something really nice going here..
i'm glad i found this place tonight.."}
{"text":"This is the place for simple but good japanese food.  There are many other japanese restaurants in Toronto but the fish is fresh and the wait staff are nice especially the waiter, Jason.  I fly in from NY a few times a year and always stop in to this place for dinner.   The place is kind of small but the atmosphere is nice.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the chefs has definitely changed but the quality has not. Some of the best sushi in the city sashimi and nigiri included. The rolls were big and filling and the fish was fresh and delicious, had an actual taste and melted in your mouth. The service was good, the waiter was a bit over enthusiastic to remove our plates but they were pleasant. My company and I enjoyed ourselves very much and definitely plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Don't let the upscale surroundings fool you --- Yuzu No Hana clumsily sends out poorly prepared food from their sushi bar and kitchen. My sushi deluxe entree consisted of stringy, desiccated fish over lumps of rice. A spicy shrimp tempura roll was sauced with overpowering mayonnaise and was simultaneously soggy and fried. Even an order of o-toro was neither buttery nor unctuous. The service performed many missteps, including, but not limited to, giving chopsticks of different lengths (perhaps a joke?) and claiming their self-named Wifi spot was not theirs."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go find a Sushi joint in downtown Toronto on a recent visit and we stumbled upon this place. Luckily we came around 6.30 since it was still pretty quit but by 7.30 this place was packed, so if you're going to check it out go early or else at least make a reservation.

The sushi was fresh and very tasty. We got a few Maki Rolls (Spicy Tuna and Salmon were my favorite) and some Sashimi selections. They have plenty of Sake selections also, but we just ordered some hot house sake which was deicious.

I would definitely recommend this place and would go back again the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and both meals were superb.  I've had a smattering of items from the menu and I'd say focus on the sushi, sashimi and maki.  They're all wonderfully done and incredibly fresh.  This is my go-to place for a quality sushi experience in Toronto!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the city. The sushi is fresh and is garnished with unique items such as sesame seeds and crispy sea weed that enhance the taste of the sashimi. Only giving it a 4/5 since its a bit on the pricey side. Great place for a first date for all the guys out there that want to impress the ladies ;)"}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  Was told this place can get pretty busy so we had reservations and we got seated right away.  I got the bento box which I usually avoid at Japanese places but since it was the option that allowed me to try their sushi and kitchen food.  There were 7 of us, so there were a variety of dishes on the table and I must say, presentation of their food was impressive.  My bento box came stacked (2 trays), thought that was kinda cute.  The kitchen food included salmon and steak terriyaki and tempura.  To be honest I could've done without the kitchen food.  The salmon was overcooked, the steak was mediocre and tempura batter needs a little work.  But the main attraction and where they won my vote was the sashimi.  It's probably the freshest I've had in Toronto the price it offers it.  Definitely would be back and have their chirashi next time!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.
Im pretty picky with my sushi, so here it goes.
Had the sushi deluxe lunch special for 25 bux.  comes with 12 nigiri, shrimp tempura maki, miso soup, salad.  Of course its chefs selection, of course no Toro.  The sushi varied in freshness, the sushi rice was not warm, but slightly cold.  Wasabi was not freshly grated.  It was by all no means bad, but also no where near perfection, which would achieve 5 stars.  Pretty good value however.  Free hot green tea."}
{"text":"SOUL FOOD! What's YOUR \"soul food\"? 

Mine is Japanese. I am always up for it - even if of I am NOT hungry! 

So today, I just finished up at the Global Design Jam (a 3 day intense service design project) and was exhausted and hungry and really needed a pick-me-up!

Yuzu delivered! 

A cute quaint space with simple interiors, and dim lighting, it was a cozy rather quiet restaurant, which was what I needed!

WHAT WE GOT

Udon - chewy thick noodles, simple but tasty miso based broth.

Kamo Gyoza - the \"duc\" potstickers tasted ... like ... pork? ... where's the duck? If it was there, it was overshadowed by the pork! I wasn't bummed because it was still YUM!

Kendaiso YUZU - like Chirashi (bowl of sashimi & mixed greens on top of rice). You get complimentary spicy sauce, which I HIGHLY recommend adding, to give the dish a kick! LOVED it!

Yahooooo for Yuzu!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: we did not actually eat here - didn't get that far.  Before, I called to make sure there were gluten-free options, specifically asking, \"Do you guys have a gluten free menu?\"  The answer was affirmative.  We got there and asked for the gluten free menu.  The waiter proceeded to explain that they don't actually have designated gluten free items, but that the sashimi and a few select rolls that don't contain fried elements or soy sauce glazed fish are naturally gluten free.  I'm not a picky eater, but that left nothing appealing on the menu.  In addition to the lack of options and the misleading phone call, the waiter was uniformed about what is and isn't gluten free.  Not willing to take any chances, we left after that."}
{"text":"In Toronto for work and was a little bummed about eating alone. Looked around on Yelp and found this place and OMG it was amazing!! Best sushi ever. Sat at the bar and watched everything get made which is super fun, especially when on your own. Started with a Tuna Avocado Tartare to start (pic) and it was so fresh and flavorful. I then had hamachi sushi and a crunchy spicy tuna roll. Everything I ate was amazing. I loved how little rice there was and how the fish stood out. I would recommend this place to anyone!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to come back to this place and second visit did not disappoint either. The freshness of the fish here is amazing for this price point. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really liked everything about this meal. Not that experienced eating at higher end sushi places and I am usually pretty conservative on what I order sticking mainly with salmon and tuna based items. Tried the chefs selection sushi and loved all of it. Ordered some butterfish al la carte as well which was delicious. Everything made with care and super fresh tasting right down to the miso soup. Oysters in half shell were a nice change to the western seasoned I usually have. Service was prompt and helpful. Only thing I wouldn't order again was the higher priced sake. As much as I appreciate a nice bottle of wine with dinner I didn't see the value for the price when it comes to sake.  Just stick with the cheap stuff or beer and spend your dollars on the fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Really nice sit down sushi place! Lots of options for raw fish, cooked fish and vegetarians. PLUS steak for those that don't want fish! Staff is great and the wine was flowing!!!"}
{"text":"It's a bit on the fancy side, food are delicious, although the presentations are really really nice. My wife likes to order the flame sushi plate.

Kind of hard to reserve, you got try two or three days earlier for a weekend booking."}
{"text":"Nice cozy sushi bar that was quite busy on a Tuesday night. Sashimi and rolls very fresh with two handsome chefs constantly crafting and serving them up at the bar. We loved its seafood stone bowl with the perfect amount of crispy rice at the bottom.

Servers very polite and anticipated our needs! Reasonably priced for the good food, service and great atmosphere. We finished the night with a Sake cheese cake that was quite unique! T'was an enjoyable dinner =]"}
{"text":"Had tempura udon for lunch at the counter, and the lunch menu was pretty diverse with a great selection. Courteous and polite service, especially the chef. After conversation, he gifted me a tasty salmon hand roll. 

The place is a bit loud, but I like that. It's also spotless, although going to the restroom felt like I went to a completely different place, and looks like an outdated elementary school."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 11 that included two very young children. Staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. They even gave us some ice cubes to put in the miso soup for the kids so they wouldn't get burned. We didn't order sushi but did order sashimi and a lot of other cooked dishes and appetizers. I found that the sashimi was a lot better than JaBistro and didn't have a single complaint about the food. Would recommend the oyster shooters, matcha tiramisu and sashimi (especially the otoro if they have any that night). 

Loved it and would not hesitate to come again!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent: super fresh and amazing presentation.  The service was fast and courteous.  The price was right for the food and service.  I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very comfy, dim lighting makes for an urban lounge feel. 

This is the extension of Japango but it doesn't quite match up and the prices are steep. The sushi/sashimi is fresh and delicious with great presentation. The oyster shooter was so-so. I did appreciate the agedashi tofu which was presented well.

A hot seafood bowl and udon came out hot but bland. Topped it off with some real black sesame ice cream.

Overall, decent fish for a high price point. Expense it?"}

AMBIANCE
+Rather non-descript from the outside - simple black overhang with the resto's logo in red. Open the doors to be greeted by a short staircase leading you into contemporary Japanese interior of casual elegance. Dimly-lit and intimate... unless you sit at the bar! :) 

FOOD [Dinner for 2: $45 (incl tax + tip)]
+ Complimentary ocha - green tea on the house w/ refills
+ Miso - on-point! 
+ Nabeyaki Udon - UMAMI! Broth was very lovely, udon noodles were cooked to just the right density, and generous amounts of seafood. I'd definitely get this again
+ Yuzu Maki (shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado, tobiko, seared at table) - OKay, we ordered this partially to see the blow torch in action... but the roll itself was delicious! Shrimp tempura added

SERVICE
- Despite making a reservation, my friend and I still had to wait to be seated. Even upon arrival, servers avoided making eye contact to recognize newcomers to the restaurant. Evidently everyone seemed very busy but acknowledge
+/- Must wave down servers because they're so busy taking care of existing patrons and outbound orders but very responsive 
+ Still provided tea refills even though my friend and I long finished our meal 
+ Very courteous in thanking customers and greeting goodbye"}
{"text":"Worst sushi in the city. Tired decor with uneventful space. Came here based on yelp reviews- trying to introduce sushi to someone that's been hesitant to try sushi. All I can say is that they will forever stay hesitant due to this below average spot. Trust me- don't go here based on the reviews- they probably hired ppl to write them. I've eaten in the some of the best restaurants in the world. This place is definitely not even one of the best restaurants on the block!"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and the presentation is beautiful, even insta-worthy BUT the menu is not too informative and the prices are a bit high. There was only 1 waitress working and took forever to get certain requests across like more water or getting the bill. We asked where the meat for the steak and the oyster comes from and she didn't know, which was surprising.. The food was good and definitely would give this place 4 stars but the service and venue was disappointing. The women's bathroom especially has a run-down/dingy atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chefs here are great!  I like to sit at the bar tables in sushi restaurants so I can observe how skillful the chefs are and for this place, the chef here is definitely great!  The skills he has for skinning a fish to knowing exactly what he is talking about for the fish he serves really impressed me.

The sushi and sashimi are great here!  They are very fresh!  I really enjoy that fact they have daily chef's recommendation on a separate menus where you get to taste some of the best sashimi at a relatively cheap price!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Japanese
Menu items: Butter Fish, Yuzu Maki and Chef's Sushi Delux

Butter, was how Yuzu's fantastic assortment of sashimi, nigri and sushi felt like in my mouth. This restaurant deserves a full 5 star review for its excellent service, friendly staff, calm atmosphere, nice decor and amazing food and plating presentation. It just has all the right things working together making one's dining experience a delight.

Starting with the butter fish (the name itself describes its taste), the fish is soft and fresh. The top is a bit burnt (guessing blow torch) to complement the soft texture from the fish and add some crunch to it. Topped with a cute looking potato-like chip, I felt like I was in heaven eating this piece of white goodness.

Deciding on the Chef's Sushi Delux comprised of a lovely assortment of nigri and 6 pieces of sushi; the night was definitely taking shape in the form of yummy raw fish. From what I recall, we were served with a really great selection of squid, tuna belly, salmon, tuna, shrimp and scallop.

The sushi was a traditional dynamite roll. But at Yuzu, there is nothing traditional about their sushi. Still with its own twist to it, the roll was tasty, savory and the rice was just done right.

Rice, is what I want to talk about now. I always thought rice in sushi or nigri was just a partner to fish, at times, to fill one's belly faster if the raw fish was not enough. However, Yuzu taught me there is not such thing as just a \"side\" of rice. Their rice is one of their best, aside from the fish. Its perfectly cooked and seasoned, the grain is just the right texture and...its just like butter. Coming to think of it, I think part of the reason why this whole experience felt like butter to me was because of the rice itself. What a treat and an enjoyment to one's meal. 

Last menu item, and one with which I had the most fun with, was the Yuzu Maki.
The maki (aka sushi) comes with flames bursting off the side of the plate, serving as the searing avenue for the dish. The server waits until the flames have ceased and then proceeds to explain what the dish is about. Simply, a delicious concoction of shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado and tobiko. The scallop is atop the maki which upon biting onto it, gives away the soft and buttery flavour of the scallop, then hits you with the spiciness and before it gets too spicy the rice and tempura from inside the maki come to calm it all away. What an unforgettable experience.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana"}
{"text":"Every time we dine  in Yuzu No Hana, from appetizers to main course is absolutely phenomenal, the service is always pleasant and attentive. We have been to many Japanese restaurant and Yuzu no Hana have meet my expectation! :)"}
{"text":"Yup, its really really good. Not cheap of course. But traditional sushi extremely well prepared. Make a reservation. Try some sake. If you like sashimi, this is it. Service is not lighting, its a relaxed, classy place."}
{"text":"Great sushi with great drinks.

Appetizers:
Agedashi Tofu - Very crispy with properly flavourful broth
Grilled Hamachi - Cooked perfectly with good char and no dryness

Also, their sushi was great overall. We ordered a roll which I do not remember specifically and an abundance of nigiri. I was able to order the fresh sea urchin and toro, both of which were delicious. Their nigiri was the appropriate size, as many sushi restaurants tend to either provide too large a cut of fish or too much rice. Both of which are not pleasant.

For nigiri I ordered:
Uni
Toro
Salmon
Hamachi
Eel (both river and sea)
Surf Clam

I was pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of their surf clam, which most sushi restaurants prepare incorrectly or with frozen surf clam.

When I come back, I intend to eat omakase and try the freshness of their octopus."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh sushi and sashimi.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  The waitstaff was very attentive and the atmosphere was chill and slightly romantic.  I would go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"A gem tucked in the adelaide pocket.... A great variety of sakes, both hot and iced. Sashimi was fresh and melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I am finally writing a review for Yuzu No Hana after fifth time going there - and without a slightest doubt, Yuzu No Hana is one of very handful few establishments in Toronto  that serve quality Japanese food with somewhat decent price (aside from Zen Japanese Restaurant).

Service:
I made a reservation right on a very busy TIFF night - was late for 15 minutes and our spot was still reserved for us and we didn't have to wait at all. Service is prompt and attentive as usual, again, considering the very busy night. 

Food:
We ordered mostly variety of sashimis and gindara as main -- as I believe this is the distinguishing feature of a good Japanese restaurant. All Sashimis were fresh, moist and seems to melt -- and is what is expected of this establishment. I was just a little let down that I didn't see any shrimp as part of the assorted sashimis that we ordered.

All in all - if you are looking for Japanese restaurant with sterling reputation and decent price, look no further. Are there Japanese restaurant in Toronto? there would be few, but they would be twice as expensive as this. The only one that provides similar (if not better) value would be Zen, however that establishment seems to be located way out of the city and ambiance would be at a two level down from Yuzu.

Highly recommended and definitely would return"}
{"text":"It's a nice place for date or after work. 
Food is decent. I have to say their tuna tartare was fantastic. I just couldn't stop eating it. Sashimi was average but got some variety with fishes than other places."}
{"text":"Found my favorite Sushi restaurant for Toronto
This has been a 9 month journey to find a strong sushi joint in Toronto. Tried many.  Been here twice and I must say that it meets my 3 criteria of great sushi: 
1) Fresh - that scent of the ocean, not the morgue
2) Cut - what is served and how
3) Exotic - the hard to get fish or shredded wasabi root or shiso leaves, etc.
Ordered the Chirashi sushi for lunch and for dinner.  Even provided a grilled prawn head -  a must eat! Portion is smaller than other places and the price is higher. I found the portion just right.  Lunch Chirashi was $18 and dinner was $25. 
Overall 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Had the spicy tuna rolls, Philadelphia rolls, and gyoza. Best sushi I've had in awhile. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Fresh - check. Delicious - check. Affordable - for downtown Toronto and delicious food - definitely a check. Service - well, let's just say it wasn't bad. Everyone was very nice, although our waitress must have been new because she had no idea what she was serving. 
Overall experience - amazing! Solid sushi spot. Does it beat Japango - not even close. But I don't know what would."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Yuzu. I arrived on a late Tuesday night (about an hour prior to closing) and they were very friendly. Great service and excellent food. Some of the best sushi I've ever had and great green tea."}
{"text":"This place has excellent grade sushi and the ambiance is very nice. However I wouldn't quite give it 5 star rating so I find it to be a bit pricey. Other than that a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Met up with a couple of old friends to catch up over a meal, and I don't think I could've picked a better place.  As one of my friends pointed out, restaurants on this stretch of Adelaide have to rely on being exceptionally good for customers since they're not going to be getting the walk-in fare.  Perhaps it is no surprise to find such standouts as Khao San Road, Ravi Soups and Yuzu on such a narrow stretch of Adelaide street.

We tried the edamame, avocado & tuna, shrimp tempura, a few rolls, some sashimi (otoro, hamachi and sake), the unagi fire roll (served flaming and delicious).  The otoro was quite expensive ($22 for 3 pieces) but delicious, and the hamachi was as good, perhaps better, but considerably cheaper ($8 for 3 pieces).  By the time we tried to order more, they were finished.

All told, the service was excellent, the meal was reasonably priced ($60/person including tip for a meal that included sake) and tasty, and the atmosphere was fairly quiet."}
{"text":"Be careful to all vegetarians and vegans. Was at Yuzu No Hana on Adelaide street last night. Ordered completely the veg options. When booking the reservations through Yelp, added under comments that we were vegetarian.  Ordered from the Winterlicious menu, all Vegetarian items ... (Marked with V on menu).  Advised our server we were vegetarian. Confirmed when our meal came it was vegetarian with the food runner.  All assured it was - until I specifically said \"no fish sauce\". Ooh turns out the soup and the sauce on my rolls contained fish sauce !
I was very annoyed obviously as clearly they false advertised as vegetarian when it was not, and they took absolute no care in ensuring they understood our \"vegetarian\" needs.  To make matters worse, they removed the soup , yet offered nothing else as a replacement. Or a discount... ?  Nothing. 
Chef's and restaurants have a responsibility to their patrons in terms of the content of the food.  Our beliefs should be considered as important as an allergy... (however if you had a seafood allergy you would have been extremely sick-or worse). 
I am so disappointed in this place now ! Such a lack of respect for their customers.  We were a party of 4, spent well over 300.00 and came away incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"1 star off for the rude elder dyed blond long hair female waitress. 1 star off for inaccurate price menu. 
The younger waitress was sweet. Had oyster on half shell, lobster roll (not recommended), gyuu rice bowl main, matcha cake(best) and sake cheesecake. 
All personal opinions. Possibly would not be there ever again."}
{"text":"Food was really good... given positive reviews I tried a few things I normally don't get at a sushi place... salmon roe with a quail egg topping was great and the cooked cod was fantastic... will definitely go again.   Cheers..."}
{"text":"Yuzu is a solid restaurant for Japanese food. It is busy and casual during lunch hours. During dinner hours, I've been here at times when it was quiet. But it seems like majority of the time this place gets quite loud. Especially on weekday nights, people working around in the area will come for drinks and small dishes after work. 

There is a great variety of items. Their sashimi is always very fresh. Whether I am here for lunch or dinner, I will always make sure I order some sashimi! Another item I like is their yuzu roll. I love rolls that are packed with flavor. Other items I like is their oyster shooter, this is very refreshing to eat in addition to the other heavier items I tend to order. 

For desserts, I absolutely love their black sesame ice cream!!! If you like black sesame ice cream , you must try it here. It is sooo creamy and it has a bold black sesame flavor. I highly recommend for anyone who likes black sesame ice cream because Yuzu have some good quality black sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"We were on our way home from the Eaton Centre and decided to stop for a bite to eat.  That said this restaurant is very good.  Not great, but definitely good.

When we first arrived it was very empty, 3pm but the atmosphere was extremely relaxing with some nice jazz music playing, and very quick service.  The server was very friendly and quick to bring our drinks.

The sushi we ordered was of the good but not great variety.  It had a lot of flavor, was fresh but I found the portion size to be a little on the small side, and my spicy tuna lacked that 'crunch' that I've become accustomed to at higher end sushi restaurants.

The music at some point went from Jazz to that of a computer generated character making sounds that can only be described as what I imagine a dog drowning in a pool of peanut butter might sound like, to a really awkward club beat.

Sadly, our nice relaxing atmosphere became a race to get out the front door.

The food was very enjoyable though and the restaurant itself very clean and spacious.  Would visit again perhaps during normal hours to see what its like."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp.  Really good sushi place close to my hotel.  I would give the slight edge to the other sushi joint I reviewed in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but nothing out of this world amazing. The Sake menu is well stocked. Little pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Yuzu No Hana is a beautiful Japanese restaurant with great quality. I've had takeout there too and it felt like a true Japanese bento with lots of sides and grilled fish. The restaurant itself has a great ambience, lots of room for larger groups and premium quality sushi and sashimi dishes. I think it's great place for celebrating a birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"Came here as a surprise from my boyfriend for my birthday. I'm such a sushi fan, especially after dining at JaBistro 3 times. I have to be honest, JaBistro is still my favourite, but Yuzu comes as a close second. 

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted by a lovely hostess. The decor is quite fancy, but a bit dim for my liking. Otherwise,  I would like to come back here perhaps on a busier night and try the Omakase since I've seen so many good reviews from it!

Our server was really quirky, and charming when we asked him what he would order from the menu. If you've ever been to Etsu, the layout menu for Yuzu looks exactly like it so I wonder if they're owned by the same person...

Anyhoo, this is what we got based on the server's recommendation:

Tuna Avocado Tartare Tuna: avocado, japanese herbs, garlic oil (12) 

This was worth every bite. It was so beautifully presented, I was so sad I couldn't take a picture. The avocado brought out the taste of the tuna, and the sauce was at the bottom of the bowl so you can decide if you want more or less of it. The tuna was absolutely fresh.

Sushi Deluxe Chef's Selection, 12 pieces of nigiri, 6 pieces of maki (31)

Each piece of nigiri was perfect. There was horse mackerel, mackerel, seabream, salmon belly, tuna, scallop and much more... It was all fresh and each piece would melt in your mouth. The sushi rice was actually sushi rice and was flavored differently as well! Of course, I would still choose JaBistro, but  if you do come to Yuzu, this is one of the finest and freshest dishes you can get. 

Overall, this place is great. I went on a Tuesday so it wasn't that hype, but you got the privacy that you would want on a date. I wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"The place was an authentic japanese restaurant that was also very welcoming in offering dishes that everyone could enjoy. Our table ordered all sorts of sushi and sashimi and the flavour was pretty yummy. My only warning would be that this restaurant serves the TINIEST protest of rice with their sushi and sashimi. It's pretty odd considering I've eaten sushi a million times and I've never once had an experience where the restaurant cheaped out on the rice.
Also my server took my plate with wasabi on it as soon as I put the last piece of sushi in my mouth, which really bothered me since I wanted to still have wasabi with my last bite. Also I think it's rude to take a plate away when someone is still chewing their last bites in their mouth. 
However I probably wouldn't go back based on the portions of rice given."}
{"text":"The sashimi came with miso soup and rice.  I opted for the miso soup, and Ru took over the rice.  So we took our pick and tasted the first piece.  I was shocked.  The soy sauce was horribly salty.  I noticed it right away, and asked Ru to try it out.  She said it tastes like the chinese soy sauce you use for cooking.  This is outrageous.  The taste of the soy sauce completely covers the taste of the sashimi.  We couldn't understand why a restaurant like this would not have the proper sashimi soy sauce.  Never have I ever been to a Japanese restaurant that served sashimi with this kind of soy sauce.  Although the sashimi was fresh, the soy sauce ruined the taste.  We were very disappointed.

{"text":"Great customer service. Our waiter was awesome and personable

Fresh sushi with fresh ingredients
I was kind of disappointed in the blah decor though
The yuku roll was delicious"}
{"text":"Had a bunch of their apps and some of their mains. Tuna Tartare was great, light subtle flavours.
Their sushi rolls, awesome 
Fried calamari was great as well. 

The thing I really didn't enjoy was their soup, kind of boring/bland.
and I had great fun trying their o-toro tuna sashimi as I have never had it. It was beautifully presented. But I can tell it was a little past its date (not very fresh) which was a little disappointing considering how much was paid. 
Was a little annoyed they didn't have the sea urchin available. 

If it wasn't for the tuna or the soup, I'd give it a 4. But definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! Stumbled upon this place when my friend and I were looking for sushi in the area. I know there are a lot of sushi spots downtown but this one is really something special. Upon entering it was packed, we weren't sure if we were even going to get a table but they took us to a reserved table right at the front next to the window. We were already impressed with the place just from the service.

We tried four different sushi's and all were superb but our favourite was the house sushi special I can't recall what it's called on the menu but it come out flaming and tasted amazing (a tad spicy)! We were also impressed with quick time we received our food even when the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Dependable sushi place that has great sashimi quality. Also tried their eel on rice which was delicious too. Much bigger space than Japango with similar quality. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Presentation was beautifully set but food are bit over price. I would expect to have better quality with this price. Too bad we ran out of room for dessert.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I came here a couple years before but didn't really try anything other than the Spicy Salmon handroll. I came back again with my cousin and his family and we had a feast! We tried pretty much everything on their special/recommended menu. It was delicious. The fish and ingredients were fresh. Prices are pretty reasonable. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive and would recommend items for us to try and everything that was recommended was well worth trying."}
{"text":"I came here for the dinner omakase with no expectations but the overall experience and food was still very disappointing. 

The staff was friendly but did not care at all about our preferences, allergies or what we thought of the meal. They also seemed quite unfamiliar with the dishes in the omakase and could not provide adequate explanations. 

It was a seven course meal comprised of a mixture of cooked and raw dishes - all of which were below average tasting. Nothing tasted fresh and food was plated very half-heartedly. I've seen better presentation at all-you-can-eat restaurants. The omakase did not feel like a well thought out meal, even though it required a one day notice. Some of the dishes tasted like leftovers from the previous night's service carelessly thrown together. The meat dish was overcooked, the sushi tasted old, and the temperature threw off the flavours of the fish. In addition, the fish selected for the sushi  were primarily of the cheaper variety and were under seasoned (we were told it was already brushed with soy sauce, but all we could taste was the overwhelming wasabi). 

Ignoring the $120 price tag, I'd probably give the omakase a 2/5. Factoring in the price: 1/5. This is definitely not the place for a good omakase. For a better tasting meal in the same price point, try Kaji or Yasu."}
{"text":"Great sushi place with decent selection of sakes.  Unfortunately, there sake list was depleted and we couldn't fully explore it.

I got the soft shell crab appetizer to start and it was good.  It needed a bit more flavor and less slat but the freshness of the crab was second to none.

I got my typical selection of Nigiri so there isn't much to describe other than the freshness of the fish.

A bit pricey but when it comes to raw fish, I prefer erring on the side of safety.  

I lived in Vancouver for about a year and a half so I know good fresh sushi.  This place could hold its own in Vancouver.  It's not the tip top but they get it.

The ambience is avante garde as one would expect for a boutique sushi joint like this."}
{"text":"Yuzu No Hana is a fantastic upscale sushi restaurant for a date night (or just a nice evening out with friends.) It is in a great location, perfect for before/after a Blue Jays game or a night at some of Toronto's bars. 

The staff are friendly and helpful. They were quick to suggest dishes that would go with what we were looking at ordering. 

The Japanese shrimp tempura is a treat if you've never had it before. The uni, if they have it in stock, is well worth sampling."}
{"text":"Best sashimi and sushi I've ever had, hands down. They've set the bar high and ever since eating here, every other place just tastes like, well, crap. I've pretty much made up my mind that if I want sushi, this is the only place in Toronto I will go to eat it."}
{"text":"I came to Yuzu No Hana because of its 4 star rating on Yelp. However, I was very disappointed by my experience. We sat at the sushi bar for dinner, which is my preferred seating experience. Service was good, however the quality of the nigiri was uninspiring. We ordered a variety of items including the Sushi Omakase for $68. It was not worth the money. The presentation was nice, but the fish was dry and did not have much flavor. I would advise you to visit an alternative Japanese sushi restaurant for the same price, but better experience and food."}
{"text":"A nice quiet, dim-lit place for dinner. Great variety of fresh, high quality sashimi!

Started off with avocado tuna tartare. Love the texture of the tuna cubes. 
Next, had assorted sashimi - very fresh, good quality, and unique selection aside from tuna and salmon. Two white fish I particularly liked that had a fishy taste (yellow jack?)
Ordered the flaming roll, forgot the name, it was alright. 
Dessert - green tea cake and black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but overpriced. 
I could have gotten the same or similar uality for cheaper. 
The wait staff were nice, a bit lost at times though."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bento box.... Lovely unique components (Tempura, salad, sashimi, special vegetables). Service was a little slow but folks were very nice. If you want high-end sushi, great place to try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food at Yuzu. The bento box is a good amount of food and I enjoyed every item in my bento box. The sashimi was my favorite item in the bento box as the fish was high quality. The tempura shrimp was also delicious and had the perfect amount of light crispiness. The cooked salmon was in a sweet sauce which was good but honestly I enjoyed the raw sashimi salmon more. I also had the yuzu signature roll and it was both delicious and quite the spectacle as it came out on a flaming plate. I also ordered the soft shell crab but didn't like it much because I didn't like the crunchy batter the crab was fried it, the crunchiness of the fried crab overpowered the crab meat."}
{"text":"Don't know whats so special about this place. They seemed understaffed (1 server couldn't keep up with about 6-7 medium tables) and we had to wait long time from seating to ordering cause the waiter was just all over the place.

We had the Sushi & sashimi morioawase (basically sushi boat) and a few apps and rolls. It was decent but not worth the price imo."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend when we were shopping in the area.
The servers were so friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  Very elegant and relaxing
The food however was just average as far as the maki we ordered.  The rice was slightly too hard and the rolls were really nothing special.
But against the usual sub-par sushi joints lining the dt core this place is far better."}
{"text":"well, I went here some months ago with a friend and I am not such big fan of sushi, but in thise place actually I liked a lot, there were a problem with the order and the bill, but is a good place to go with friends and try this asian food"}
{"text":"Had the Yuzu Dinner - totally not worth your $70. I liked the black cod and black sesame ice cream, but everything else was mediocre at best. The tuna sashimi was so extremely thick and fishy my friend almost puked. Service was quick and friendly tho."}
{"text":"WoW - this place just took the cake on poor service. Came in for lunch on Saturday afternoon at 1 pm. Only one other table occupied, otherwise totally empty. Asked the waitress if she could switch a nigiri in the bento box to include squid (like for like price exchange). Absolutely not possible.

They actually let me walk out of the restaurant. 

No wonder it was empty....bizarre lack of customer service and flexibility."}
{"text":"I was craving some quality sushi so I decided to see what Yelp was saying. Yuzu came up pretty high on the list and I heard it was owned (or affiliated with) Japango thought it was worth a go.
 
We ordered a variety of dishes, mostly rolls and sashimi and it was all very fresh. The rolls were tastier than any ACYE place, and a bit better than a decent a la carte sushi spot.
 
The cuts of sashimi and the overall freshness was evident, and for that reason alone I'd return to Yuzu. The only disappointment was the rice which was rather average and didn't have that unique high-end Japanese quality to it.

PROS: The sashimi salad; nice layout and atmosphere, friendly service; price point.
CONS: Lack of care/prep put into some of the rolls; average grade sushi rice."}
{"text":"My friends and I went out for a celebratory dinner at Yuzu last weekend.  The atmosphere is great.  Not too haughty-taughty, and not too sketchy like most sushi restaurants.

We went for the omakase -- $70 in the end, not including tips and services.  This would be about $100 if you get a drink as well.  

Service was great -- our waiter was really great, and a little awkward, but he was a very nice man.

To sum up what we had our omakase menu (basically, that means it's the \"chef's selection\").  We had the following:
1) OYSTER SHOOTERS: containing fresh oyster, quail egg, tobiko, yuzu ponzu, uni and green onion.  It was DELECTABLE.  Probably one of my favourite dishes of the night.
2) ASSORTED APPETIZERS: I can't recall what it was exactly on there, but one dish had a fiddlehead, uni, freshly chopped wasabi, and some sort of tempura.  It was okay - my favourite part was the uni though.  The second part was a miso eggplant.  Meh.  Third part was a cucumber sushi - fresh.
3) COLD EDAMAME SOUP:  I'm not the biggest fan of cold soups, so I was a little taken back from this.   The ginger was delicious though.
4) ASSORTED SASHIMI:  There was a sashimi tasting plate that came with 3 different fishes.  I apologize, can't recall what they were.
5) HAMACHI KAMA?: I'm not 100% sure if that was it, but it was some type of fish, grilled.  Filled with little bones.  I wasn't the happiest with this dish, because I don't like fish with bones... It's too tedious .. and dangerous.
6) DUCK: We had some sort of duck that was apparently roasted for two hours (it was delish) - it came with a small side dish of cheese and marscapone cheese on top.  Big fan of the duck, not a big fan of the cheese -- I felt like it was out of place.
7) MYSTERY BOX w/ SOMEN: It was okay - again, not the biggest fan.  The somen was wrapped in some egg, and there was a shrimp sashimi on top of ice.
8) CREME BRULEE GREEN TEA:  Absolutely delicious -- I usually am not a big fan of desserts, but this really hit the spot.

All in all, the omakase was \"meh.\"  I think I was overhyped for this.  I wasn't very impressed by the dishes that were provided for us.  The fresh was fish - no doubt... However, too overhyped for me."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Wednesday night. Was starving so I was looking for a place that had good sushi combo options since I didn't want to go over my business expense limit. This place definitely fit the bill. 

I ordered the sushi and sashimi moriawase (CAD $70). It came with 12 pieces of nigiri sushi, 13 pieces of sashimi, clam miso soup, and an appetizer of black cod (I think?).

The nigiri sushi consisted of scallop, fatty tuna 2 ways, eel, crab, squid, yellowtail, salmon belly, red tuna, uni, and a couple other things I didn't know the names to. 

The sashimi consisted of sea bream, yellowtail, scallop, fatty tuna, seared salmon, and also a couple other things the waiter didn't know the english name for. 

Miso soup was a large bowl and had 5 or 6 clams in it. Really great flavor and not too salty.

Also got a fish appetizer which was the only thing that I didn't care too much for. The fish had some bones still in it which was a big turnoff. 

The things that really made me like this place are the fact that all the sushi was super fresh, generous portions, reasonable prices, and it was operated by japanese staff so I knew it was the real deal. Oh yeah and great service too."}
{"text":"Yuzu, has a very calm feeling about it. A great place if you want to have a conversation with someone. The service, as some Yelpers have already highlighted, was lacking.

Here what we ordered and my impressions:
- Butter fish: interesting but not a stunner (3/5)
- Oyster half shelf: Fresh but lacking some tang (3/5)
- Spicy tuna roll: Fresh and yummy (4/5)
- Miso glazed cod: Delicious and satisfying (5/5)

Liked this place and would go again, but would not venture out specifically for this!"}
{"text":"Maybe because we were here on Sunday, service was slow and disorganized(took order 2x in a row and only had 1 water refill in entire meal $100).  They did not remove the smell from oyster shoot, and did not feel it fresh.  Sashimi cuts were sloppy but fresh enough. We ordered few dishes, and the only thing we liked was the Yuzu maki, the flame maki, looks great, and taste great too.  I would go somewhere else for the same price."}
{"text":"Very convenient that you can make reservation on yelp. We ordered Chef selection. It is very fresh and yum. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"Yuzu No Hana is a great sushi place. I've been here for dinner on a Friday and lunch on a Wednesday and both times the service has been excellent. Their sushi and fish quality is good, not amazing. The food comes unbelievably quickly and the waitresses are so friendly."}
{"text":"High end Japanese restaurant in the downtown core.

Yuzu Sushi & Sake Bar is a modern Japanese restaurant.  I especially liked the saki bottles lined up along 2 walls.  

The fish were fresh and the nigiri was a nice size that I can eat the entire thing in one go.  The Chef Sushi platter is available if you didn't feel like thinking.  The sushi chef will create a beautifully plated dish of nigiri and rolls.  Each one has is slightly tweeked to add texture or interest.  For example, the salmon had white and black sesame pressed onto one end.  

The wasabi wasn't that imitation kind you sqeeze out of the tube.  This is the real stuff, so be careful or you'll start tearing up.  The item to skip was the Lobster Maki roll.  It was bland and not worth the extra money.  The must order item is the black sesame ice cream, which was creamy and almost a peanut butter texture.  If I had more room at the time, I would have ordered another one."}
{"text":"** Review for Summerlicious Dinner 2017 **

This is the first time Yuzu No Hana offered a Summerlicious menu so me and a group of friends decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, despite the great taste and delightful presentation, we were left hungry after our $28 3-course dinner.

Environment:
The restaurant is steps away from the King/University St. Andrew subway station, really convenient spot. The restaurant is divided into 3 floors, with the most bottom floor being the washroom, the 2nd floor the main dining spot, and top floor the private party room, which our party got to use because there were about 20 of us. 
The private party room is really nice and since it's the only dining area on the top floor, you can enjoy a quiet meal without disturbance from the guests. However, I'm not sure if there is any elevator for those who have trouble climbing the stairs. 

Food: 
I got the Tuna Tartare for appetizer, Sushi Platter for main, and the Matcha Tiramisu for dessert. 
Tuna Tartare tasted pretty good, I liked the miso/soya sauce that they used and it wasn't overly salty, but the portion was a lot smaller if you were to pay full price for the regular dish. 
Sushi Platter contained 13 pieces of Nigiri Sushi, and they were made the traditional style with wasabi in between the rice and the fish. The fish tasted fresh, no watery/soggy texture, but not exactly enough for dinner. 
Matcha Tiramisu was also very small. It wasn't like your typical tiramisu in the sense contained no coffee liquor, and the cream was made with matcha flavour. I liked it, but I also wished that we had more of it. 

Service:
Our servers were professional at accommodating our big group and they got all our food correct. They mostly left us alone while we ate each course and would come by to pick up the dishes before the next course was served. 

Overall, I found that the food just wasn't enough for dinner, so we basically had to go grab some cheap eats after, which was unfortunate, considering $28 before tax and the 18% gratuity wasn't exactly cheap for dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi - overall the sushi was fresh and tasty.  The rice was appropriately flavored and coupled with the fish quite well.  
O-toro bluefin tuna:  Rich tasting and savory.  Oh and it came with 24k gold flakes on top.
Kanapachi, Madai, Shimaaji - okay to be honest I forget which ones were which once she brought them out.  BUT, they were all pretty good.  
King salmon:  They slightly sear/char it on top and then thinly slice some hashes.  Very good - and different than normal.

The service was outstanding also!"}
{"text":"Came by for the first time for lunch a few months back! Loved it and couldnt stop talking about it to my friends and family.  Not too many japanese restaurants impress me in the downtown core....  Yuzu No Hana had fresh, awesome quality fish. Had the \"sushi and sashimi \" between the two of us with a side of Gyoza!  Food was well priced!  No drinks, bill came up around $60 with tax and tips. Great service and atmosphere! Excellent food presentation.  I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Yuzu is impeccable. I stopped in here on a business trip, upon the recommendation of fellow yelpers, and was extremely impressed. I had the chirashizushi and a glass of saki. The chira selection was perfect - tuna, clam, salmon, sweet shrimp and a generous portion of sweet egg. Also included was the first seaweed salad that I've ever enjoyed - usually it's too fishy for my tastes. The sweet shrimp head was perfectly fried - not overdone as I've seen at other sushi restaurants. Decor is minimalistic, but modern. Staff is attentive and polite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It's closer to a 3.5-3.7 for me. Its a nice environment, spacious and comfortable. I sat at the bar and was able to watch the sushi masters or itamae at work. I'm here in search of the best (or maybe one of the best) sushi houses in Toronto to bring my bf to for his bday and I have to say that unfortunately, this one will not be it. That is not to say it is not good though. I've just had better.
I had a customized sushi and sashimi platter. The sashimi was really well selected. Very buttery and full and obviously fresh. The sushi was nice and some were pleasant on the palette. I then ordered a shrimp and uni sushi. The shrimp was fresh but the rice fell apart which made it cumbersome and messy. The uni was from Hokkaido and it was sublime. Very sweet and buttery and it melted in my mouth. 
Service-wise, it was pretty good. I can't complain. They were polite and helpful and offered the customised sushi and sashimi option that suited my palette more than the option that was in the menu. Overall, I had a good experience, everything was just a little shy from what I've experienced and know is out there but I would recommend and come back if I want something better than your usual sushi place."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked along Old Toronto on a Thursday night looking for something to eat.  Most of the restaurants we went to were all packed and would take more than a hour wait to get a table.  We decided to call restaurants nearby to see if there was any available seats for four we could get immediately instead of wandering in the cold.  We called Yuzu No Hana, fortunately they were not busy.  When we arrived we were seated immediately.  We were given the menu and the waitress constantly checked up on us to see if we were ready to order.  Once we placed our order, our food came quickly.  I ordered the Chirashi bowl and it came with miso soup.  My friend ordered the combination of 18 pieces sushi (California roll, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna).  My other friend ordered the seven course Yuzu special.  Lastly, my other friend ordered tempura appetizer and dynamite roll.  Considering this is a \"fancy-ish\" and \"high-end\" place, I thought it would be nice to give every one a bowl miso soup during their meal.  I know some restaurants offer every customers miso soup on the house while their customers are looking at the menu or while waiting for their food.  The Chirashi bowl I had was delicious.  The sashimi tasted very good quality and fresh.  I felt that I was getting full quickly because it came with too much rice.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal.  I also tried my friends' dishes and thought it was pretty good.  I felt that their food were of high quality and fresh.  Whatever food you end up ordering, you won't be disappointed by the quality of food."}
{"text":"Expertly prepared sushi. The food is worth the praise it gets, it might not be the best I have had but it was a well made meal. The plating was beautiful, the rolls were plentiful and fresh. So why the so so score? Some of the most miserable customer service I have encountered in this city. Our waitress largely ignored us (leaving 40 miniutes between drink order and asking us our food orders), when she did occasionally return she was sullen and barely responded when we were trying to speak to her. She brought the completely wrong bottle of sake and acted shocked when we didn't want it (it was more than double the price of the one we ordered) At one point, as we finished ordering she simply walked away and talked to another table without a word. In fact she seldom spoke at all. Every request was met with a huff like we were putting her out just by being there, and all of us were incredibly polite the entire time (more flies with honey right?). The way she treated us basically put a damper on the entire evening."}
{"text":"modern, classy japanese spot in the heart of downtown.  decided to try this place out as a part of toronto's summerlicious 2017 event - $28 for a three-course dinner.

started with the albacore tuna tartare, served in a spoon with cubed avocado and a tangy yuzu ponzu sauce.  the portion was a bit small, but this dish tasted phenomenal.  great mix of sour, sweet, and savoury with a variety of textures.  i chose the alaskan king salmon confit for my main course, and though it looked a little plain, this had to be one of the best salmon dishes i've ever had in my life.  cooked to a tender medium-well and coated in fat/oil, the meat truly melts in your mouth.  some may say the fish is lacking in seasoning or sauce, but there's no need for that as the fat provides all the flavour.  the accompanying vegetables served as a great light counterpoint to the richness of the fish.  i ended my meal off with the matcha tiramisu - a not-overly-sweet dessert that could have used a bit more matcha flavour, but delicious nonetheless.  the plating for all three dishes was stellar and absolutely instagram-worthy (see photos).

the waitresses provided good service during our entire meal.  i won't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks for a delicious and slightly upscale japanese dinner in toronto"}
{"text":"Oh yes. At last, a great sushi restaurant in this trip overseas. Had the sushi omakase which was just about perfect, for rice size, rice cooking, and flavor mix of the fishes. I only wish I had ordered green tea and not a drink which in the end I left aside to taste the flavor of fish.

The price is not cheap but totally adequate to quality. Service was nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent sushi! The sushi chefs are super friendly and make great conversation with the people at the bar. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service, the servers were amazing. Overall it was an experience i wouldnt mind doing again. The sashimi was bomb shit!"}
{"text":"Very good quality. My Gf and I went on the weekend with a reservation. Staff was very friendly. We ordered:

Yuzu Maki
Scallop rice croquette 
Butterfish sashimi
Tuna tartare

Everything was delicious! Except we were served the scallop croquettes without any actual scallops...just a rice croquette with sauce. We informed the waiter and was given another order plus 3 additional scallops for free. Very good service!

Only minus is that it is a bit more expensive than other sushi restaurants.

Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago but forgot to put up this review until now! 

Went with 4 other ppl and even though our bill at the end was about $700, it was totally worth it. The food was delicious. Everything was so fresh I still dream about it sometimes. My boyfriend and I hadn't eaten all day from doing errands so we were really hungry and may have gone a little overboard. 

I started with the tuna avocado tartare ($12) which was soooo good. For the main course I had the sushi and sashimi moriawase ($70) which has an assortment of toro, ikura, salmon, Uni, ebi, and other fish that I didn't recognize in sushi and sashimi form. Everything was perfect. Not sure how else to put it. The flavours were on spot, the fish was so fresh and the toro melted on my mouth. I had an order of hamachi sashimi ($8) which was 3 very large pieces so it was actually a pretty reasonable price. We ordered Salmon, eel, and ikura sushi as well as the Yuzu maki ($18) which had shrimp tempura, spicy scallop, avocado, and tobiko seared at the table for everyone to share. These were also delicious. Finally we were stuffed and we got to dessert and decided to split the matcha creme brûlée ($7) and sake cheese cake ($8) between the 5 of us. The restaurant gave us the green tea tiramisu for free since we had racked up such a high bill. The matcha creme brûlée was ok and the sake cheese cake had this sake jelly on top that was delicious as well. I liked the green tea tiramisu the most though. 

Overall, food was great. Presentation was good. Service was attentive as it is a small restaurant and it wasn't too busy (it was like -30 out). I would definitely come back but not as hungry as I was since the prices are higher than your a regular Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the hamachi uni masu, blue fin tuna, and several other dishes. Presentation was beautiful and taste was great! Highly recommended. The seating was somewhat tight even though we got the window seat, but we were walk in and were able to be seated right away."}
{"text":"They have a great atmosphere; fusion of Japan and modern city style. Beautiful lighting and interior design, along with comfy seating.

Food is relatively good, though not as good as their sister restaurant Japango. Food consistency is good, though tastes a bit more bland, and seems more thick compared to Japango which distorts the taste. With that being said, their prices are also slightly higher than Japango, though their specialty rolls are amazing. It's a total show and tastes great. 

Would I go back? Sure. Though I'd prefer returning to their other branch. Overall it was great food, service, atmosphere... but a tad pricey relative to the food."}
{"text":"My 200th review goes to Yuzu No Hana. I had a lovely dinner there so worth a special review. Had the Omakase here, multi course tasting menu. Each course presented with an explanation and one special course presented by the chef himself. 

Started off with an oyster shooter topped with garnishes and paired with a raw quail egg. The combination of flavour was very good. 

Then came an assortment of small bites. I can't really remember their lengthy descriptions.  All I remember was everything was tasty and there was a really good seared tuna, a uni tempura, a fluffy fish morsal, and a nicely sliced sardine twirl. 

Then came a teapot filled with mushroom and seafood soup. It was really cute to be sipping soup in a tiny tea cup and then eating the contents from the pot afterwards. The presentation is impressive. 

Next came the sashimi plate. Good selection and the fish was very fresh. I especially liked the ginger that came with it. 

Then came an intricate package where I untied it and found a sweet soy glazed cod fish. The fish was very tender and flavourful. 

And then came the assorted sushi platter with different colors of tuna, salmon and octopus. 

In case I wasn't stuffed yet (I was) out came the soba noodles in soup to fill you up. I'm not a fan of soba noodles per say but I ate it all anyways. The mushroom broth was very smooth. 

And finally we had dessert - sake cheesecake with raspberry sauce. The cheesecake was very light and mousse like and the sake flavour was light. A nice way to conclude the meal. 

The atmosphere was also pleasant, cozy and warm. We went on a weekend and dinner took us 3 hours but service was great and meal was worth it."}
{"text":"We stuck to sushi rolls, and they were all delicious. My only drawback is that the signature roll should be brought out first, we were full by the time it got to the table, and it was by far the best. We would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"I would say this place just needs a little TLC.

I think the food is decent. We had a hot pot and the salmon, plus Wakame & Edamame.

The Wakame was slightly above your average cheap and cheerful place, but the portion was quite small. The Edamame was standard, no special spices or tastes which is fine. But both are priced premium to the cheap and cheerful hence I did expect a little something extra taste wise.

The hot pot was great, I would say this was the best of the bunch, and the salmon was pretty good, cooked well. Overall I would have rated this place three, given that the food was better than the average Japanese restaurant but really nothing super special and it is priced at a premium to a Yonge and Gerrard type place.

The service though I found lacking - they were busy and maybe understaffed but the service was a bit slow - aside from the multiple tea fill ups. Also the hot pot came very quickly but the salmon came 5-10 minutes later. The hot pot was so hot they could have left it in the back until the salmon was ready. Basically everything reeked of them being rushed - maybe they had a theatre crowd and just wanted to get everyone out quickly so they wouldn't miss the shows.

The interior is pretty nice, not splashy in anyway but comfy and modern Asian.

2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a busy Friday afternoon.

Tempura was standard.

Spider roll was something to write home about.  Crab was light and not overly deep fried.  Nor was it heavily breaded as you will often see from most Sushi restaurants. Roll was full of texture and it was a \"punch in the mouth\" of flavour.

Lobster roll was similar to the spider roll but I found it bland.

2 stars was for the absolute brutal service we got from our idiotic waitress.  She forgot to ring in the lobster roll which is fine.  Just SAY SOMETHING... like, \"Sorry, I fuked up.\"  

She abandoned us for 20+ min. and another waitress came by and said the chefs are making our roll after she rang it in and wrote \"urgent\".  

Of course, the chefs were working on a large party so we waited.  And waited.

Would I return? No."}
{"text":"I went there to try their summerlicious dinner. It was $28 for the 3-course dinner which included appetizer, main course and dessert. I selected Kamasu Nanban, Alaskan King Salmon Confit, and matcha tiramisu as my three courses. Kamasu Nanban is a kind of cooked fish with radish pickles. I liked the cooked fish but the pickles were too sour. But anyways, I was surprised by this appetizer. Salmon confit as a main course it came with a bowl of rice. I think it is a Japanese tradition. The salmon was pan fried and the fillet was big. I couldn't finish the rice. Matcha tiramisu was on average level because its matcha flavour was not that strong. 

Each portion was on average size especially there was a bowl of rice and I think it is worth to try! I will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"the service was a little slow, and i didn't like that we couldn't order directly from the sushi bar.  overall the food was pretty serviceable."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had the crunchy spicy salmon roll, the Alaska roll, the spicy scallop roll and the wakame. 
I found the rice on some of the rolls to be a bit warm--I personally prefer the rice to be a little chilled. However, the seafood tasted fresh. 
The service was nothing special, but it wasn't bad. 
I liked the decor: slick, sophisticated and simple. 
I would go back."}
{"text":"Review regarding staff attitude not food. I made a reservation for 8 people for 9:30pm (1 hour before closing 10:30pm) on a Sunday. We arrived about 10 minutes late. When I made the reservation I was notified that there is an automatic gratuity added for groups of 8 or more and that they will not do separate bills. This was not an issue for our group. When we arrived only a few minutes late we told the hostess that we were there for the reservation and also asked the hostess to see the menu quickly just in case as we have a vegan and a nut allergy in our group. After a very quick glance we found items that suited both and were ready to be seated however the gentleman at the host desk said there was no table for us and that we would have to wait. I repeated that we had a reservation and he insisted that nothing was available. We asked for a few more menus so we could decide on the food while we waited. He reminded us that they would not split bills and they would add gratuity - this time he added that we would only have 25 minutes to eat. We didn't quite understand as it was now 45 minutes to closing but said sure we'll be very quick. He handed us 1 more menu, so for a group of 8 we had 2 menus. The original hostess came up and I reminded her that we had a reservation and she said oh yes we have a table waiting for you. This was kind of confusing as well as the gentleman was very sure there was no room for us. I guess there is some miscommunication between these two staff? As we were being seated I noticed she did not have any more menus for us so I asked her for a few more menus so we could order quickly as the restaurant was closing soon. As we sat down I felt a little uncomfortable and asked the rest of my party how they felt. Everyone agreed that they felt very unwanted just based on the attitude of the gentleman at the door. He seemed very intent on getting us to change our mind about coming in and we all decided that if it continued we would not be eating there. When the waitress returned with more menus she came up the first thing she said was \"My manager just asked me to reiterate to you that for parties of 8 or more the gratuity is added and we will not split bills and also that there is a minimum of $30 per person\". Again none of this is a problem but I am not sure why we needed to be reminded over and over unless they were trying to get us to leave. I understand places that want to close on time of course. But the right approach would be to have told me over the phone when we made the reservation that they simply don't take reservations that late instead of having us walk all the way over there just to be rude to us. Also the $30 minimum a person would be easy to reach with an app/soup, a roll or two and a drink and you would easily be over the $30 however they had never mentioned it to us the first two times so it put us under the impression that this was a last attempt to get us to leave. We decided that if the manager was not interested in our business that we would not be staying. We were disappointed as we had read great reviews about the food. However the attitude of what I believe is the manager was very unpleasant and none of us will be bringing our business here in the future."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some friends. This was a decent sushi place. I had the bento and we split a dragon roll. The sashimi and sushi was fresh. I opted for the salmon version of the bento. It was well seasoned. However nothing really stood out. I've had the same quality of fish elsewhere for cheaper. The price was a bit on the high side for what I got. The dragon roll didn't have too much eel on it. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive. They were very good about splitting the bill for us. The ambience of the place was nice and I enjoyed the decor of alcohol bottles on their walls."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for my birthday and it was incredible. I had heard many good things on Yelp so I was intrigued. Almost as soon as we sat down we were greeted with a steaming hot cup of green tea. I then started my meal with the miso soup and it was delicious. The broth was thick but too thick and it had a depth of flavour to which I'm normally unaccustomed. Next up was the crunchy spicy tuna roll. The presentation was beautiful, it sat on a large plate where everyone at the table's first order of sushi was served and the taste was incredible. It was astonishingly fresh and the spice was perfectly balanced in terms of heat and flavour. The second order of sushi I had was their signature Yuzu roll and I must say that this is where the chef really showed his expertise in the craft.  If I had to explain the roll in one word it would have to be \"hot\"- as in the plate was served on fire! Along with incredible presentation, the food out of this world. The variety of flavours all seemed to compliment each other and you could tell that each piece of the roll was prepared with care and delicacy. Finally I finished the meal off with the Yuzu creme brûlée which was very similar to normal creme brûlée but it had a little something added to make fit in perfectly with the rest of the meal. All in all I would say the food and staff created the perfect experience for both a nice dinner out with friends and family or a classy dinner out to win over a client."}
{"text":"So very disappointed and would have rated this place one star if it wasn't for their salad which was pretty refreshing and their yuzu creme brûlée dessert.

We were a party of five. Waiter mistakenly seated us at a smaller table that only fitted four people, but he quickly made the correction and moved us to a bigger table. 

Sashimi deluxe- presented with various types of sashimi, looked good, tasted ok. 
\"Live\" uni- I put quotations because I really don't know if they served us the live uni. We saw a large sea urchin on the bar counter when we got seated. The waitress quickly came by and told us if we like uni we should get it because it was the last one for the night and it's $25. I thought, $25 for that size is a pretty good deal! The rest of the party was excited to get it. Waitress asked us how we want to eat it, we told her sashimi with no rice. Twenty minutes later the waitress brought to us the uni shell with uni
Sushi on the side. There was rice in each piece and the uni were shades of brown color, liked scary. Had one piece that was in a spoon with rice which tastes ok/average. Had the second piece which was straight up bitter. We suspect the uni was not fresh and that they gave us at least two different uni. The way the waitress was selling us the uni was already fishy.
Asian pear and tofu salad- refreshing and tasted good. Small portion.
Yuzu sushi roll- presented in flames, gimmicky, taste was mediocre but disappointing for being a star roll for the restaurant
Hokkaido scallops- okay
Raw scallops- no flavor, texture ok
Seafood bowl (?correct name)- bland, but rice was nice and crispy from being cooked in the stone pot. Seafood was ok
Rice- a bowl of rice that tasted like leftover rice from the previous night, dry and hard. Nobody touched it after a bite
Yuzu creme brûlée- berries on top was fresh and creme brûlée was flavorful with yuzu

Ambience- not bad, dimly lit. Restroom downstairs was fairly clean. 

Price- expensive for what you get. Tab was over $200 and we didn't feel too full or satisfied.

Do not recommend. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I want to like the place but the winterlicious menu was very disappointing. I expected a lot more for a downtown location charging downtown prices. The food was below average compared to Markham, portion size were small except for the big bowl of cheap white rice. At $33+tax+tip per person, I was hoping for more. The server were rushing to push us out even though the place had empty tables. Atmosphere was very typical (few empty bottles, a random picture).

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm getting a little biased but after another delicious meal at Yuzu I must insist that this is the best sushi place in the city.  You cannot beat the B.C. Albacore.  Tuesday and Wednesday the fish is spectacular."}
{"text":"Food was good & fresh. The menu has just enough choices. I didn't see dinner set, just ordered 2 special roll(~$15), sushi plate with 3 pcs maki ($30) & miso soup ($2) on a side. Finished dinner with sake cheese cake & green tea tiramisu. 

Sushi & roll are as expected, nothing special, but very fresh. 

Dessert - sake cheese cake was a pleasant surprise!!! It has a New York cheese cake texture and a little sake flavor at the first bite not overpowering at all then cheese finish. Beautifully played. The portion is quiet small for a $8 dessert though. 

Dessert - green tea tiramisu was just alright. The cake is too moist, there's liquid squeezing out at the bottom as I cut it with my fork. The green tea flavor was there, not much of the cheese flavor that a tiramisu should have was found though. Alright portion for a $8 dessert. 

The service was ok, we waited a little to get our order taken. But food came quickly."}
{"text":"I'm  giving this place a 3 star because even though the sushi/sashimi is fresh and very good (if a little overpriced), the service when I went there was terrible. It was a quiet night, aside from me there were maybe 4 other tables of couples, but the server was ridiculously  pushy. I had just finished my meal when they brought me the bill without me asking for it. It was only 8pm! I was making a business call and the waitress just hovered over me with the card machine. I actually had to ask her to come back. I don't think this is the way customers should be treated and will definitely make me rethink going back there, especially  for that price."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've received in any restaurant, let alone sushi.

The sushi itself was quite good, but far from the best I've ever had.  I'd say that it was overpriced for the quality.

Would probably look for another location considering the vast choices in Toronto (I'm from the States) but not disappointed in the experience I had."}
{"text":"Black sesame ice cream!
Quality was very good. But food wasn't very memorable. Or perhaps I felt their decor was too dim and boring."}
{"text":"Yuzu No Hana is a great restaurant.  We've been multiple time and each time, the food is fantastic, fresh and beautiful.  Staff is also very nice,  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and I had a great time. The atmosphere of the restaurant was good, the service staff was friendly, and the food came at a reasonable time, despite it being busy on a Friday.

I ordered the chirashi don (sashimi on a bed of rice), and it is literally the best chirashi I have had in Toronto. It's my usual go to item to try out at a Japanese restaurant, and it did not fail to impress me. The rice was made perfectly with a bit of seasoning to prevent it from being bland.

The assortment of sashimi is amazing, the sashimi is fresh, there is even uni on it (sea urchin!). The chirashi don also came with miso soup (nothing special, but nice)

I also had black sesame ice cream for desert, and it again was delicious and had that rich milky texture coupled with the intensity of the black sesame.

I will 100% be coming back for some more sushi in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and felt a bit pressured by the waiter to order. For an upscale restaurant, service isn't amazing. I've also been to various Japanese joints around Toronto and honestly, I don't really get the hype here. The fish wasn't particularly fresh or amazing. I also feel like for the price I'm paying, I could go to a competitor somewhere else for better quality and value. We had the Roll combo, the sushi combo and the Yuzu roll. I think my favourite would be the Yuzu roll but that is because of the cool fire display when it first arrives. Another thing that I thought was pretty stupid was that we ordered 3 dishes and still the waiter asked if the non-combo would require an extra soup and proceeded to charge us $2 for the soup. Normally, I'd assume a place like this could afford to put a miso soup on the house but apparently not.... Overall, I will not be coming back anytime soon. One and done for me."}
{"text":"I went here for a Valentine's day date and it was exceptional.  They had a fixed menu so there really were not too many choices, but I am glad that it was fixed because it got me to try many items that I would have otherwise not chosen.  When I go to more fancier and upscale restaurants, I usually have higher expectations and Yuzu has definitely met my higher expectations.

I can tell that the chef has put a lot of thought into the menu.  Each dish was beautiful and the flavours were intricate.  It was truly a work of art.  I had raw oysters for the first time at Yuzu and loved it!  They served a broccoli soup and I was pleasantly surprised when it was not a cream based soup, it was very different but very suitable for the meal.  Each piece of sushi served was different and unlike your typical Japanese sushi restaurant.  

The service was very good.  The waitress was tentative and the courses were evenly spread out and allowed for good conversation.  This place made for a very impressive date, although I admit I was expecting Swiss Chalet so I was setting a low bar there."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The sushi and sashimi were phenomenal. The tuna was by far the best I've had in a long time. I highly recommend the tuna avocado tartare, the garlic oil was an unexpected flair on a classic combo. Service could have been better but the food was so wonderful, we barely noticed. The restaurant only serves Sake and wine, but had a good selection of sake and a noticeably small selection of wines. If you like fresh, high quality traditional Japanese sushi, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the $55 18-piece omakase, $15 Yuzu roll and $15 spider roll.

Food: Frankly, I was disappointed by the whole meal. The soup that came with the omakase was a lot less than the first time I've been here. The soup was incredibly salty and tasted a bit grainy. Next, when the Yuzu roll came, the fire was admittedly superb, and the taste was good.

Next, the omakase. The biggest disappointment. I am not a sushi connoisseur, so I can't attest that I know what each piece was and what the specific type of fish used was. However, some of the 18 pieces seemed to be copies of each other. What is the point of an omakase if it does not even have 18 unique pieces on the plate? Not worth the money. The variety was not good, but the taste was. My boyfriend seemed to really enjoy it, which was the point of coming here.

The spider roll was fine. Not plated great for the price, so the aesthetics had a lot to be desired. The avocado was creamy inside and melted in my mouth.

The taste was good for the dishes ordered, but the omakase felt like they were ripping me off from my experience and my money. 

Service: Service was terrible, terrible, terrible. Once I was done my tea, there were no refills or anything for a little while. In fact, I did not see the waitresses doing anything, except the bare minimum of giving our food. There was nobody going around refilling the tea, despite it being a full house. A few times, I saw them talking to each other \"because there was nothing to do\". At least they gave the food for us.... 

The table of three beside me who came before my table did not get food. During the middle of our meal, they actually all got up and left. The lead waitress, who I assume is one of the owners tried pleading with them and sort of followed them out the door. Awkward... Just another reason why service wasn't that great. Tip to the servers: If a table hasn't gotten their food while all the other tables have, maybe go up to them or the chefs to follow up? Yeah?

As soon as we were done eating, the servers really went into action and cleared our plates and seemed to have an aura surrounding them that said, \"Leave! Now! There's people waiting and we need to make the $$$\" judging by how often they came NOW to ask how we were doing. Too funny that they were being attentive at that point. Look. If I'm paying $100 for a meal, I expect to stay longer than the barely an hour that we got. 

All Yuzu has is giving \"premium\" (read: subpar) sushi that is slightly cheaper than its competitors. My advice: Go. Somewhere. Else!"}
{"text":"Good ambience, service and food.  Varied selection of food and drinks and confident enough to have signature dishes and cocktails."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Very fresh seafood/sushi 
Loved the sushi
Loved sea urchin sushi
Loved nabeyaki udon if you like udon soup
So much better than japango!! 
Not fancy but food is superb"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a couple friends and I must say I was impressed. Had their chirashi don modified with no tuna and the server was very accommodating and did not have any issues modifying the order for me. My food came with so much fish on top it made me so happy. You can tell it's fresh, also generously sliced. And the rice underneath is so flavourful. The order also came with a salad and miso soup. 

My coworker got the beef bento box and she's also one happy camper. Her tempura was crispy and the beef well-seasoned.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a good place for sushi... 

I found this place through a Toronto magazine from our hotel. I was impressed and enjoyed every part of the dinner, except for the dessert part. My actual rating would be a 4.5 stars

First when you walk in here, you can feel a really chill ambiance. Nice mood lighting, not too dark or bright. They played a smooth down tempo music in the background, so it really gives it a relaxing feel.

Good to decent service. They were a little slow, but luckily I ordered a large Kirin to keep me occupied. 

I ordered the double decker bento ($30) - miso soup, salad, one choice of the teriyaki item, tempura, pickled vegetables, sashimi, and sushi. The rainbow roll ($12) 

I chose to get the salmon, and in return got two fat slabs of teriyaki salmon. =]   Each piece of the sashimi (salmon, tuna, mackerel) was out of this world tasty. 

The quality of the fish is pretty darn fresh, so I have no complaints at all. 

They have a good selection of sake, so if you like that then this place is for you.. 

Con: They didn't have the two desserts we wanted. They ran out dammit!!! Green Tea Tiramisu or Green Tea Ice Cream -- Doh =("}
{"text":"My foodie friends in Toronto recommended this place, since I was in town and working in the financial district. It's a modern, clean Japanese restaurant tucked away on a quieter street.

The prices were reasonable, if not a bit on the steep side. But we were right in the heart of downtown Toronto, so it's expected. 

I ordered the chirashizushi deluxe ($32), which is the chef's selection of sashimi on sushi rice. It was nice and fresh. It wasn't anything mind-blowing, but still pretty good.

One friend ordered the assorted rolls ($19), which were 3 maki. And my other friend had the unaju ($20) which was broiled eel, with a sweet soy sauce glaze on sushi rice.

All of our meals came with miso soup to start.

I would likely come here again, but with so many restaurant choices in Toronto, it probably won't be for a while. I know I can find something tastier and cheaper somewhere else. :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional and a different experiences from other Japanese restaurant in Toronto.
Just got back from a trip to Tokyo, I can tell their sashimi are pretty fresh compared to the one in Japan. 
However, their signature yuzu roll is a bit too salty, they might need to adjust the sodium level in their sauce. That's why I gave them a 4 stars.
But overall, the experience is good.
And don't forget to order a sake cheesecake. It is unique and tastes yum."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night with reservation for a party of 3 around 7pm. Upon arriving the host did not show us to our table and merely pointed to it. It was understandable since it was near the door. The first problem we encountered was our waitress. It was our first time here and wanted to take a few minutes to look at the menu before ordering. It appeared to us that she was hurrying to try to get our order in. 

I had ordered the oyster shooter chirashizushi deluxe. The oyster shooter was small. oyster was small, there was actually no uni in it at all. This appitizer was basically a raw quail egg, tobiko and green onions. The chirashizushi deluxe.... not really deluxe at all. from other post of chirashizushi deluxe on instragram, other people appeared to have uni included in this dish. Instead they substituted it with unagi (eel). If i knew that i would not have ordered this dish. I honestly did not see what was so deluxe about this.

Overall i found the food quality to be average. The quality of the food here does not reflect the price that is being paid for. Service is also below average for a Japanese restaurant. Most other Japanese restaurants in the GTA such as (Ja-bistro, Guu, Juu, Fune, Santouka Ramen) all treat their guests with over-the-top courtesy and mannerism. One key gesture of respect and manner that i often look at good Japanese restaurants is if the server returns the receipt to the customer with both hands; That was not the case at this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was great, small portions but very tasty. Had to wait 40 min for table, waitress brought edamame and tofu as complimentary which i don't eat."}
{"text":"A little bit noisy restaurant, management could work on this, but definitely recommend.

Very good food. Fresh fishs, good service"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden sushi place off Adelaide, on the second floor.  So unless you know about it, I doubt you'd stumble into Yuzu!

I don't know the current status, but I heard as of a coupla years ago, Yuzu has the same owners as Japango.  So if you're familiar with it, expect the same quality as Japango.  Also reminded me of Sushi Nomi on Roncy, but of course, the dining experience is better at Yuzu.

This place is definitely not your pedestrian, AYCE quality sushi.  Attention is paid to plating, you get a good variety of cuts (not all salmon), AND, the best part, wasabi is fresh ground.  None of that powder stuff and it does make a big difference!

Seems to be a good place for a business lunch."}
{"text":"AVOID FOR SUMMERLICIOUS.  I came here for summerlicious.  The appetizer was nice.   However,  the main entree which i ordered was just simply a pan fried small cheap salmon filet dumped on a plate which i could make anytime by myself at home.   The dessert was supposed to be a sake cheesecake but there was nothing special about the cheesecake.  It looks like a cheesecake you buy at a cheap supermarket.   I paid $36 for a meal that should have cost at most $15.   Waste of money.  The portions were soooo small that i went to McDonald's afterwards to fill me up.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"wow! unfortunate i've only been here twice but damn, the fish is so fresh, it just melts in your mouth.  this is THE place to go to hit up japanese.  it is PERFECTION. highly recommend sashimi items.  Though, the tempura was actually just GOOD but not amazing.  prices are a little more steep. quality though really makes up for it.  highly recommend! also try out their speciality dishes!

{"text":"I am a fish/seafood snob. I grew up on an island and currently live in the city by the bay so I know my fish. And because my daily schedule of films was a little intense (often starting at 9am and ending at midnight) I mostly tried to eat lighter meals that wouldn't leave me in a food comma that would then result in me sleeping through half of a film. Which led to my desire to seek out a good sushi place close to the theaters that had become my temporary home. Yuzu seemed like the perfect choice.

This restaurant is beautiful. I could see it as a great place for a first date you want to impress.

The staff was friendly and attentive and offered me the sushi bar or a table as a single diner during TIFF so they score extra points for service.

The food was delicious but a little expensive compared to San Francisco prices and this meal was almost as expensive as my dinner at Canoe and Canoe is a fancier restaurant.

I had the yuzu sangria, scallops and shimeji, and the seafood bowl. The only choice I regretted was the sangria. It was tasty but an odd combination that by the time I got half way through it I still didn't love it so I'd suggest one of their sakes or sake-based cocktails instead. The scallops and mushrooms were decadently rich in their buttery sauce. The seafood bowl was a tasty mix of sea creatures over rice in a stone bowl. I wished the rice developed a little more of a crust but that also may have been my fault for trying to scarf it down as quickly as possible to since I only had an hour and 15 minutes between screenings."}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto and I have been here for more than 10 times, but I'm only giving it a 4 star due to the customer service. The customer service is slow and unprofessional. When I ask for the bill, expect them to come back in 15 minutes...if you ask for tea refill (which you shouldnt even ask), they will come back in 10, and Im not a very patient person. 
On the other hand, their fish is fresh and perfect. I will give them 10/5 for their food. Presentation is gorgeous. Food quality lives up to the price tag. Highly recommend their Uni sashimi! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty generous 4, as I feel it should be more of a high 3.
The ambiance/atmosphere is fitting of that of a fancier sushi restaurant with professional servers. I got the sushi set for $30, which had 12 pieces and 3 maki. They did include uni as part of the set which you don't usually get at this price point which was a nice surprise. However, the quality of the fish was mediocre. 
At the end we had a small slice of complimentary cheesecake, probably because we came pretty late close to closing time - free food definitely makes me happy.
Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten a 5 star rating had the service been faster.

What I can say is that the food speaks for itself at this place.

I's recommend the Tuna Tartar (If you are feeling adventurous) as well as the vegetable Udon Soup (Amazing Broth!)

My wife and I went for our anniversary and I'm happy to report that we had a great time at Yuzu No Hana, The decor was great and the food was fantastic and fresh."}
{"text":"I recently visited this establishment during winterlicious, however not as a participant for winterlicious (read: I was spending $150+, not whatever the 33$ prefix menu was). 

The beginning was okay, the server asked us if we wanted a drink, my husband and I, ordered a bottle of wine. We were at a table of 4. The server brought the glasses and then didnt pour the wine! throughout the entire meal, we had to pour it ourselves! (Which, yes I understand this isnt a big deal, but when you mark up a 13$ at the LCBO bottle, to 40$+ then you are paying for the service, we were sadly not served). 

On to the food. My husbands main dish came shortly after ordering. The wafu steak, which was indeed tasty. However, the other 3 peoples orders (mine, and the other couple that was with us) DIDNT COME. After my husband ate all of his dish. The plates were cleared, and we all sat, just waiting for our dinner. After another let's say 15 minutes, our server asked if we were ready for dessert! At that point I strongly informed the server that we had not received our dinner and it was poor service to only serve One in the group and not everyone within a timely manner. He apologized, then brought us all the wrong orders. (aka I think he grabbed whatever was ready to go). Then the server had to retake our orders. When the sushi arrived, it was decent, but wayyyy too spicy. Like they just slabbed it on in order to hurry. 

There was also issues when paying. They didnt split the bill even though at the beginning we informed them there would be two bills. Then I had to run my card through twice, which seemed shady. 

In summary: food was alright (nothing special) slightly over priced (AYCE are cheaper and roughly the same quality. service was poor."}
{"text":"A must-go sushi spot.  The wife and I both got the moriawase and omg was it good.  
Started out with an interesting seaweed (at least that's what it tasted like) item that whet our appetites.  Followed with the sashimi, that was so flavorful and buttery smooth in texture and taste.  Never had hamachi this good.  Next came the standard sushi set.  The only thing that might've made me give this 4 1/2 stars was that the rice was a bit on the harder side and the taste was a bit on the blander side.  But the service was great, even scored some \"service,\" which if you're korean, you know what that means.  Think the owners were korean, heard some of it scattered here and there throughout the night.  Ended the dinner with a sake cheesecake, which was what you'd expect from a cheesecake but much lighter so we didn't feel so weighed down after the meal.
Would love if this quality of sushi was available in Detroit.  It's only 4 hours away, what's the deal?!"}
{"text":"My friend has recommended this place and I am glad I finally tried it out. The restuarant is located in the entertainment district of Toronto. I love sushi and I must say that their sushi was very fresh. My friend and I had tuna tartare, sashimi deluxe, and a spider roll. Tuna tartare w/ avocado was amazing- interesting flavour; sashimi deluxe was very good, except I thought the sashimi pieces were bit smaller than how I wanted. Spider roll was okay, again the pieces were bit small. It's good if you don't like having lot of rice on your maki but we left the restaurant still hungry.

Service was good, but not excellent. Nice atmosphere for afterwork dinner or date night. The place is smaller and initimate but open-concept.

Bit expensive but good quality food!
I would go back."}
{"text":"Aside from the one fly that was pestering us, the place was good w/ decent sushi. We ordered dynamite and it came out w/ avocado (didn't say on the menu that it has avocado in it like all the other dishes), which my friend is allergic to. All good! Went to burger priest next door for my friends instead!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in Toronto.

Five year anniversary. A big deal. And we both love sushi, have bonded over it, argued about it and even had fun making it at home. We're serious about sushi, but not the kind of high roller that can throw down cash for omakase. Thankfully, the set dinners at Yuzu were fantastic.

We started with a bottle Sho Chiku Bai Ginjo sake - it was served chilled and great both on its own and as an accompaniment. It was very clear and clean tasting, with just a hint of citrus. Some sake drinkers might want something with a bit more flavour, but I was quite happy with this sake's neutrality and subtle flavour.

for appetizers we had a few items that aren't on their website's menu. The scallop croquettes were very light and focused on the flavour of the scallop. Getting good scallops in Toronto has seemed liked a losing battle. Not at Yuzu. I just wish we got more than three. Most people eat out in even numbered groups - two and fours. Why do restaurants always serve appetizers which everyone is going to share in odd numbers?

We also had koma gyoza - gyoza with duck instead of pork! I thought these were amazing, The gaminess of the duck really pushed the gyoza to another level. The duck meat is inherently fatty, making a fried dish even greasier. that's fine for an app but I couldn't eat an entire meal of these.

For my main course I had the sushi deluxe dinner. A dozen nigiri pieces along with a tempura roll. Each piece of nigiri had an artistic garnish on top. The plating was gorgeous. The standout pieces were the butter fish and the seared tuna. A truly excellent meal!

Any complaints? A few minor things - the room was a little too cold and background music was better suited for an elevator. I'd prefer less Kenny G and more Japanese super jazz. To compensate the minor complaints, they had some AMAZING movie posters downstairs by the washrooms - a Japanese Amelie one-sheet, an Italian Rashomon poster (Rasciomon by Achirwa Curosawa!) and a poster for Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love. Whoever picked those posters has excellent taste.

Would I go again? In a heartbeat. I'm already looking forward to my next meal here. They've spoiled me. I never want to have cheap sushi ever again."}
{"text":"This place looked fancy when my friend an I came for late lunch. Go early for lunch because the dinner menu starts at 2. 

Anyways, we were promptly greeted and seated with our menus and water. There's lots of choices to pick off the menu. 
Sorry sushi loves but there's isn't an all you can eat menu. Everything is A La Carte which I can understand because of how fresh everything was.

We started with oysters on a half shell which was quite delicious. They weren't clouded by sauces and what not. Just lemon wedges. My friend got the Chirashi bowl and I got the deluxe sushi. Sorry I forgot the name but maybe the photos can help. Anyways, everything was quite yummy and it was nice to share everything. The portions were quite on the smaller side but after a while, you end up getting full anyways. 

Definitely a place to try here and there but never all the time unless you have the $$$"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant ever!!!  Must try the Yuzu roll and the sashimi there is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The most notable thing about yuzu is their miso soup!!!!! It caught me by surprise as it came in a large bowl with a lid on it so my boyfriend and I were like wow this soup is big! To our surprise, we opened it to find clams and strips of fish cake in it. I've never had miso soup where the chef put this much effort into it before lol the clams made the soup taste sooooooo sweet and fresh with a hint of seafood flavour. If this miso soup was on the menu, I'd definitely order it. Now that I think of it... why didn't I ask for another one? By the way, I'm obsessed with clams! 

We ordered the scallops and avocado tuna tartare. Scallops were good but nothing special. The tartare was REALLLLY good because the garlic oil, tuna and avocado flavours worked so well with each other! I could have 5 of these if my figure allowed. 

Now for the main course: sushi omakase! The omakase here is definitely a good value. $55 for 18 pieces! Compared to yasu $80 for 18 or zen $60 for 12? Helllsss yes!! BUT id have to admit it was the least yummy. And I was secretly sad that it didn't blow my socks off because it was my boyfriends birthday so I wanted it to be really special. Unfortunately, they used day old rice so the sushi rice was a little hard.... I know, wtf right!?!? The rice was cold and hard. Not slightly warm, vinegary, soft and plump. HUGEEEE disappointment there. The rice is just as important as the fish in sushi and I'm sad they failed to understand that... or they do but were just lazy/being cheap and didn't want to make a fresh batch? I mean omakase is supposed to be the \"chefs choice\" of basically their freshest catch of the day and the best sushi they have to offer. This was definitely NOT the way to represent. The presentation of the omakase was cute though... it comes out neatly lined up on a stone platter. 

Overall, I would still return to this place given that they failed on a crucial part of dinner and did not offer to refill our water once and we kept having to ask. Normally I'd go apeshit on this place but I'm feeling lenient today. This place has potential... it's just the rice was a crucial downfall. :("}
{"text":"Another superb sushi bar in Toronto! We ordered a few rolls, nigiri, appetizer, and dessert and everything was excellent. The waiter service was attentive.

The plates were warm which lent nicely to slightly warming the sushi rice. Not sure if that was intentional or if the plates had just been washed. Anyway, we liked it. The prices were reasonable for being a nicer sushi bar. The interior was modern and spacious with still a nod to the traditional Japanese style.

I definitely recommend the tuna tartar and matcha creme brulee! You also can't go wrong with any of the sushi."}
{"text":"Delicate sushi, great service! One of my Fav. Sushi place. A bit pricy but the presentation of the plates speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Showed up with a reservation. The people standing behind us, who didn't have one, got seated long before we did, which wasn't a great start. We were then asked right after sitting down if we knew what we wanted to order. Which, unfortunately, we did not, and then it was approximately a month before we did get to place that order. Food wasn't memorable, although I remember it being expensive."}
{"text":"Our meal was $180 for three people. The sushi was decent but not worth the price. The seaweed and the rice were a little bit soggy and disappointing for a more pricier restaurant like this. I wouldn't recommend. There are better places that is more worth your money."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Reservation for 7 people at 8pm. We arrived a half hour early with only 6 of us. No problem. We are seated at a great table and served hot green tea right away and not rushed while we wait for the last guest to arrive. 

In a nutshell, the service and food are incredible. I think the King Alaskan  salmon sashimi was the best I ever had. 

What we ordered (note that one order of sushi is 2 pieces and 1 order of sashimi was 3 pieces). We started with hot dishes and then finished with the sashimi/sushi.

Drinks:
- bottle of ippongi denshin sake: $150

Starters (we ordered 3 each since there were 7 of us). Prices below are for one order:
- tuna tartare : $12 ...get this!
- clams with mushrooms. Nice broth. $7. Likely wouldn't order again compared to everything else.
- oyster shooter $7. Everyone loved this but it wasn't my thing. Texture is slimy in your mouth. But glad I tried it!

Hot dishes (ordered one each and split). Bit tough to split the seafood bowl as there are 2 scallops, 4 clams, few shrimps, one piece tempura, but we did it!)
- seafood bowl. Excellent. $19
- tempura soba (hot): $15

Sashimi/sushi (we ordered 6 pieces of sashimi and 2 pieces of sushi for each)
- King Alaskan salmon. My favourite of the night! $6 for one order of sashimi and $5 for one order of sushi. 
- Butterfish. Note they seared this very slightly. Nice taste. $7 and $6 for sashimi/sushi
- Sea bream. $9 and $8 for sashimi/sushi
- We wanted horse mackerel but they didn't have so we got Sayori instead. Make sure you check my pic! It was so cool. After we finished they deep fried the heads! $42 for whole order. 
- Uni sushi (6 pieces). I don't like Uni but I was told it was amazing. $9 for one order. 
- Ika (squid). 2 pieces sushi only. $6 for one order
- Anago (eel) sushi 6 pieces). $10 for one order. 

We were there 3 hours and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 

Total cost was $518 plus tip.  But keep in mind we did have a $150 bottle of sake and there were 7 of us.

Definitely go and enjoy this experience."}
{"text":"Came back here with my boyfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day on a later day. We hadn't been here in a while and I wanted to surprise him with a reservation. The restaurant was obviously packed on a Saturday night, but thankfully I reserved a table on Yelp ahead of time. We were seated soon after we got there and were very excited to order. It seems as though the menu has changed a little bit since we were there last time, but we were still able find everything we needed. 

We started off with a gyoza appetizer, which we devoured as it was delicious! It came with 6 pieces and was a perfect size for an app. Then we ordered the 17 piece sashimi set, the yuzu roll, spicy sashimi and spicy Hokkaido scallop rolls and finally a green tea crème brûlé. The sashimi was deliciously seared and perfectly seasoned. The pieces for both the sashimi and the rolls were well portioned. The yuzu roll was perfection as we remembered. I also ordered the yuzu moni cocktail that I absolutely loved. It was sweet and a bit sour with just enough alcohol to do the trick.

Unfortunately the only complaint I had was with regards to dessert. We ordered the green tea crème brûlée, which turned out to be a disappointment. It was watery, cold and tasteless. I'm not sure what happened there, as I'm pretty sure last time it was very good. 

Otherwise, the atmosphere was great, so was the service and the food. It is definitely a pricier option for dinner, but if you want some good Japanese food then it's a good choice."}
{"text":"I always feel bad leaving a review for a place that is going to bring down the average, particularly when the staff were kind and the experience was decent overall.

I, unfortunately, have to leave this at an A-OK. The fish itself was fresh but cut in such a way that all the pieces of sashimi were chewy. The food itself was relatively inexpensive, which is great but really nothing stood out about the meal. The duck dumplings were way too tough on the inside, the spicy tuna roll was totally meh and had nothing of note to it either. 

The service was very good though.

The last thing of note. They have a green tea creme brule that sounds awesome, unfortunately they only make the custard once a week, and they had run out. It seems the time to go here, if you want that, is on Thursday or Friday, come Monday or Tuesday their stock seems to have disappeared. I would normally take this as a cue, for the restaurant, to make more of it, but perhaps they don't typically sell out. Regardless, I'm told that this is rather typical for a restaurant, so it didn't factor into my rating, though it did leave me with an un-green-tea-custard-filled-mouth."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant and decided to try it out for Winterlicious 2018, but I definitely was not impressed. I had far greater expectations for this place, but my experience here may solely be due to its affiliation with the Winterlicious marketing. 

To begin, I ordered the Yo-Ki-Hi cocktail: This was a light but sweet lychee flavoured cocktail infused with sake. It was delicious but more ice than anything. 

Winterlicious menu:
I started off with the tuna and avocado tartare and this was by far my favourite dish of the night! The tuna was very light and fresh and paired really nicely with the avocado. I ordered the sushi platter as the main course, and nothing really blew me away. You couldn't really tell how fresh and flavourful the fish was as it was sliced so thinly with a layer of wasabi placed between the fish and the rice. For dessert, I had the opportunity to try both the sake cheesecake and green tea tiramisu. While the tiramisu had a strong green tea flavour and a bit too creamy, the cheesecake was very light and nicely infused with sake.

In the end, the presentation and service of Yuzu was well worth the $$$ price tag, but the food seemed just short of that, but maybe it's just the winterlicious menu talking..."}
{"text":"Starting off my fist yelp review in 2018 with Japanese food!

It was my first time here and if any of my friends would want to have dinner there I would say yes multiple times!

I went for lunch but did not order from the winterlicious menu. Granted if people were feeling sushi then by all means but I was craving something from the regular menu.

Intro: I was first served a small helping of salad and miso soup. The soup was my goto after coming from the cold. Nothing like hot tasty soup to warm you up! The salad was nothing special but it does cool your mouth after that soup (plus the house dressing was yummy!)

Appetizer: Soft Shell crab - yummy! The soft shell crab was crunchy but the added arare (the coating) added more to that texture. Decent helping with two sauces to choose from (ponzu or the yuza salsa.

Main: Seafood bowl - the Seafood bowl is basically like a bibimbap. You have the Seafood (1 tiger prawn, shrimps, clams, scallops, 1 shrimp tempura) on top with a quail egg and some salad, and rice at the bottom. Like all bibimbap served in a stone bowl expect the rice to get hard if left without mixing. The food was hot! (Not spicy). A good dish to have with and talk with friends while it cools down. Seafood was great, the sauce with the salad great, and it also comes with 2 sauces: tempura sauce, and a slightly sweet chili sauce.

Price: very decent! I wouldn't exactly give it $$$. The soft shell crab is 14 (you can share th3 cost with a friend), while the Seafood bowl is 20 (like any mains in any other restaurant). True they do have expensive options to choose from but it is all based on preference (salmon roll vs lobster roll).

Service: was fast...but that could be misleading coz I was the first one in. 10 mins later the place started filling up fast. 

This place is great to bring a date or hang out with friends. There are a lot of options to choose from and share if need be. I enjoyed it and can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, servers were so sweet, but man, the chefs took FOREVER to make the sushi. There were only 4 tables of patrons, so the place was pretty empty, and they had two sushi chefs, so I couldn't understand why I waited 30 minutes between my salad/app and my sushi. I ended up asking them to cancel my last item because I was so tired of waiting. Too bad because the food itself was delicious (albeit expensive). If you end up going, their oysters are to-die-for delish."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Ive had take out and ate in many times. The service is great and the sushi is lovely! If you are a Uni(sea urchin) fan like I am, this is by far the best place for it... they are very generous with the Uni! Some places are not and they don't taste as great. This will always be my go to place for Sushi AND Uni!!"}
{"text":"Should have known it was not going to be good when we walked in and it smelled very strongly of fish. Really poor service. Never checked up on when we had empty wine glasses and water glasses for over 30 minutes. Sat there waiting for plates to be cleared for 20 minutes then server didn't even ask if we wanted anything else, just left us sitting there with no food or beverage until we could flag her down to get our check. Couldn't eat the tuna nigiri we ordered - had a really foul taste. Rolls were mediocre. Really disappointed I chose this place over Ki for a dinner with coworkers based on Yelp reviews. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Only sushi place i have been to in Toronto but I go to sushi at least twice a month is SF, CA & have been to some of the best in NYC & Hawaii..

I LOVED THIS PLACE!! I ordered the Sushi Deluxe. The plating was beautiful and the way the fish was enhanced by the garnishes was beyond amazing. 

Next time I come its Omakase time baby!

one small thing not related to the food... I love to interact with the chefs and they werent the friendliest bunch.."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner after looking the ratings and reviews.  We shared calamary, edamame, sashimi plate, Yuzu maki, and crunch spicy tuna maki with sapporo on tap.  $100 not including the tip.

The highlight was the sashimi plate, deliciously arranged and \"melt in your mouse\" assortments of fish that are well-aged.  Yuzu maki, which has the flame under the plate was likeable.  I can't share the same enthusiasm calamary (below average) and spicy tuna (just average).

I thought the service wasn't that great.  There were three of them standing around and they seemed clueless and slow in terms of taking orders at the beginning.  This is not a 4+ experience as suggested by the ratings on this site, IMHO.  There are better quality japanese food in the neighbourhood at Yuzu's price range and also cheaper places with better services if you look around."}
{"text":"Yuzu YES Hana!!!

Conveniently located in the downtown core, I don't know why I've never been to this place. I finally decided to drop by when I was in search of some good sushi at affordable prices near the King West area.

Chirashi Bowl
- This was amazing value at ~$28 and it was topped with an assortment of very fresh sashimi

Yuzu Roll and Softshell Crab Roll
- Fair portions and tasty
- $15 to $18 depending on the roll

Black Cod
- On the expensive side at $35
- Cod was well cooked and had an interesting flavour (glazed with honey)
- Small amount of fish on a bed of vegetables, probably wouldn't order again

What impressed me the most about this place was the sashimi in the chirashi - I will be back shortly for chirashi round 2! (This time, no sharing. We will be ordering 2 bowls between my boyfriend and I - it was that good!)"}
{"text":"This place is smaller than I expected but nice and cozy! Had a nice contemporary yet warm atmosphere!  Service is a little slow as it took them 10 mins to give us a table, even though we had a reservations. Once we sat down it took them another 5 mins for them to realize we don't have me is yet! It took waving our arms to catch them to refill or teas! For a nice restaurant this is rather basic!  I had inquire whether if they had wifi as I saw a \"yuzunohana\" network, the waiter just simply replied \"hmm, I'm not sure!\" But no initiative to find out! Which was rather odd! 
Ok, on to the food:
The sashimi was super fresh! Totally lived up to its reputation! Came here last night for a girls night out! This place have been on my bucket list for awhile! I got the 2 level bento box, it's really one as the box was half it's usual size! It had a bit F&F everything; few slices of sashimi, trio sushi, tempura, garnish size appetizer, and choice of teriyaki! It was filling for $30! 

My friends had the oyster shooter, and chirashi deluxe which was really fresh, another had the aka me salad (small nothing special), and the beef tartare rice bowl! It was actually like a bibimbap Korean hot stone pot with soy sauce & spicy sauce! Oh they also serve Asahi Black! 

One side note, we missed their little daily chef special in regards to catch of the day! So definitely ask for that! 

Although the sevice was lacking abit, might come back to try all their sushi & sashimi again on a special occasion as average of $30-50 per head, it's definitely a splurge!"}
{"text":"A great sushi bar for the price. I got the sushi omakase (which was super cheap at $50!), and was continuously blown away about the quality of the fish. However, with omakase, the chef usually suggests an order to eat the fish, which our server did not do - we just made an educated guess on the order. The miso soup was also very tasty, with actual seafood in the soup. I also got the matcha creme brulee, which was just okay. 

Service was a little slow, but I went on a busy Saturday night, so it was understandable. I would definitely come back here for the omakase."}
{"text":"It's been awhile coming here for lunch.  It used to be my go-to place for sushi downtown but since my office moved a few years ago it was a bit too far to get to.  Really missed this place.  Just came for lunch a few weeks ago.  The menu looks a bit different.  I think the lunch special menu is new.  I got the sushi deluxe lunch which was amazing...really fresh.....and really good!!!  If you want good sushi, this is definitely the place!"}
{"text":"Not being a connoisseur of the fine edilble artform of sashimi is pretty tragic given that I'm Japanese, in fact raw fish makes me cringe!  However I was lucky enough to experience the epically Yelp rated Yuzu during a UYE event, and even though I didn't indulge in the raw delicacies it was still absolutely worth the hype!

You can tell this place is a bonafide Japanese sushi place since:

1) there's no K-pop piped outta the speakers :(
2) the sushi chefs are actually parlaying in Japanese 
and...
3) they serve Ramune yay!  

There are no tatami rooms here at Yuzu though, just a sleek modern/minimalist interior, which works fine since it's all about the sushi here anyway.

Being the sashimi wimp I am, I decide to try the Lobster roll, and I'll tell you it was THE BEST Japanese rolls ever! The rice was neither too dry or mushy, with just the perfect amount of sauce/seasoning, salmon roe was unbelievably fresh, and the tempura lobster was a heavenly marriage of airy crispness and melt in your mouth crustacean goodness! It makes my inner Jap F.O.B say 
\"Monosugoku oishii desu!\" (((o(*o*)o)))

My fellow diners ordered the Kaisendon, which was like a sashimi'd version of a bibimpap salad with a side of chili sauce and it smelled really, REALLY good!  There's is even a tiny tank filled with adorable live soft shell crabs situated next to the sushi bar.  The lil' crabs are so cute, crawling about aimlessly, sadly, they are ultimately waiting out their eventual demise...or their next incarnation in the form of a spider roll :,(  

I could almost give Yuzu 5 stars, save for the service...You see, there's two kinds of Japanese servers, either the obligingly smiley and super friendly, or the stoicly icy, with the personality of drywall.  The waitresses that served us were of the second variety.  Maybe it was because our table was a lively pu**y-party (+1 male), but c'mon, don't hate on the foxy Yelp ladies laughing out loud and having a good time!

If you're sick of sub-par, blasé sushi joints, and ache for refined flavour, then head to Yuzu for fresh, authentically elegant Japanese food."}
{"text":"I love this sister restaurant with Japan Go, menu is almost the same, sitting is way more comfortable and prettier decorations.  

Food quality and service are as good as the other location.  The food are fresh and taste soooooo good! It's one of my favourite downtown sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, fast service and plenty of space to eat at without a reservation during the week. Great selection of cocktails too! Had a spicy salmon hand roll, rainbow roll and uni sushi rolls. Fish was super fresh, especially the live uni- melted in my mouth. The only thing disappointing was the seaweed salad. Although it is tasty, you only get two bites worth. Definitely hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great presentation, great service, and the best sushi I've ever had in Toronto. Make sure to try their signature yuzu roll, it's absolutely delicious! A tad expensive but well worth it for those special people in your life that love sushi."}
{"text":"Well slap me sideways and call my Sally, this place is AMAZING!

Yuzu is surely the nicest Japanese food I have eaten in Toronto. (Japango-wha?? Seriously!)

The sushi dinner I ate here consisted of 8 pieces of assorted nigiri and 6 pieces of California maki roll. I'm still fantasizing over how incredible the nigiri was. The fish was incredibly fresh and easy to nibble in half. It really does melt in your mouth just like butter. Each nigiri piece was topped with a small garnish, many which added a subtle umami component to the overall taste.

The food here also comes artistically presented; it's almost a shame to destroy by eating it. Such beauty! (Bring your camera)

Decor here is dark and kind of romantic. Not too many tables and sushi bar is set up towards the back. 

Service was very friendly with a few minor blunders but nothing that detracted from the dining experience.
 
For booze, Yuzu has decent sake selection, lots of fun cocktails (I had a sake sangria which was lovely), some beer and wine.

Yuzu in my dreams, baby"}
{"text":"The sushi was decent, however the service was very bad. We watched our server leave in the middle of dinner. And we were just left there without any service. The dinner was not worth the price. They should have communicated and let us know they were changing servers. The price was outrageous for the atmosphere, and the treatment was very rude. Not going back and will not recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I have to agree: the best sushis I had so far in Toronto! fresh, melting, perfectly sized.

Kaisen  salad is also very good. Scallops and jimeji was not tasty enough but OK.

Sushis, sushis, sushis! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Had a full dine-in meal. Appetizer (asian pear salad), main (seafood bowl), and dessert (green tea tiramisu). 

Every dish was delicious and creative. The salad was light but tasted great with all its ingredients. The seafood bowl was inspired by the korean bibimbap, so this Japanese version was simply amazing. And lastly the homemade green tea tiramisu was so good, I wanted to buy an entire cake. Waiting for them to sell the tiramisu as a whole.... 

Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. Definitely a gem on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Yuzu no Hana is easily one of my favourite places to enjoy sushi in the GTA. I can say I took my sweet time allowing each methodically constructed nigiri disintegrate in my mouth. I make no claims as to Yuzu's place in terms of authenticity (the omakase came all at once on one slate?! this confused me initially), but with only this visit does it strike me as one of the more memorable experiences eating sushi. Rice seems well seasoned and textured, and the fish was fresh and meaningfully garnished in terms of flavour. Most definitely, Yuzu comes highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lunch and was amazed with delicious sushi and sashimi they serve!
Sashimi is very fresh and well prepared .
We sat on the bar and  chef Bruce surprised us with his amazing creations!
The warm atmosphere made our experience more special.
Highly recommend this restaurant to all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"WInterlicious 2018 Dinner

I had this location as one of my first bookmarks when I first started here on yelp! The service was good, there weren't that many people at the time. As someone who eats AYCE more than a la carte, this was a change for me. I ordered the sushi set and I could not believe how good the fish was. It was so fresh, I savored every single piece as each piece practically melted in my mouth. The downside of this was the desserts because my company and I both aren't fans of cheese desserts. Black sesame ice cream was on the menu but they said that they did not offer it so we both got a matcha tiramisu. It was really hard to finish since there was a layer of cream cheese on it. My company also said that he'd give this experience 4 stars as the amount of food they gave did not fairly equate to how much we paid and the dessert situation."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Their omakase is actually quite good and a good bang for your buck, but it's marred by some inconsistency in quality and a little \"je ne sais quoi\".

(3.5 STARS)

First, let me say that this review is written in direct comparison to Kaji - *my* gold standard.

Second, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the omakase to anyone who's enjoys creativity, isn't a picky eater and wants quality Japanese downtown. 

Third, however, for $10 more, I would recommend the $80 Kaji omakase instead - it's debatable whether their $120 (and 14 course meal) is $50 better - but you'll need trek out onto the Queensway for that. 

Yuzu's omakase consists of an 8 course meal which includes a sashimi and sushi platter along with warm or cold dishes as per the chef's choice and one that usually follows seasonal availability. 

Yuzu's sashimi (as expected) was excellent in quality and freshness that was compariable to Kaji's. Some of their memorable dishes included their oyster shooter with quail's egg (but also available on their regular menu so not really specific to their omakase...) and their sea food and mushroom broth served in a tea pot. Their green tea tiramisu was amazing, obvi.

The devil's in the details and this is where Yuzu falls a bit short:
1. Yuzu's presentation was good, sometimes great, but Kaji is a continual visual feast with each dish submitted to meticulous detail and attention.
2. Kaji tends to present with more creativity and \"wow factor\" even when it's as simple as hollowing out vegetables to house the main dish. Kaji courses also tend to follow a \"theme of the night ingredient\".
3. The quality of some of the dishes were inconsistent (e.g., their tempura was actually soggy! This is the second time I've had their soggy tempura!)
4. We felt rushed by their service. Throughout the night, staff would take away completed dishes from the first person and would hover or inquire as to when the second person would finish.

I'd probably go back for Yuzu's omakase at some point, but not before trying Japango (their sister restaurant, and definitely a place that can make their tempura lightly battered and crispy!), Sakura and, in all likelihood, Kaji again."}
{"text":"WARNING! Food poisoning!!!!! I had dinner with friends last night and ordered oyster shooter,and other nigiri sushi. When I sip the oyster shooter I found broken shell pieces in my mouth. After I came home I started having diarrhea !! I didn't sleep whole night,until right now !! 18 hours non stop going washroom in and out! This place is not clean and I'm going to report this! and I WILL NEVER COME AGAIN."}
{"text":"Came here based on our friend and yelpers review...oh and we were in the area waiting for our movie at scotia bank theatre. The prices were a bit high but we ordered the grilled eel over rice and the 15 piece sashimi. The eel was out of this world. I have never had eel this good. And it came with little sides whixh were super cute and delicious.  Very good presentation. The sashimi was a work of art. And so fresh. By the end of the meal we knew the price tag justified it. We will most definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"impressed with just about everything this restaurant had to offer. love how they smoke some of the sashimi. ive never had it ths way before and I will come back just for that. Omakase was def worth the surprise. make sure you come on an empty stomach or else you wouldnt finish all 7 or 8 courses. only real downer was the seared duck which was really tough to chew on. you get the best value when you order the multi course meals. its a small place so reservations are needed. They also host parties on the upper floor."}
{"text":"Decent quantity of sushi at a reasonable price and in a swank space. But the sushi was just mediocre quality.  In fact, one piece was a bit tough and inedible. It was passable, but for me, it's back to Yelp to find better sushi."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for the weekend and really wanted to eat sushi and ended up at Yuzu No Hana.
We had the braised beef cheek (why u so tasty), the sashimi platter (why you so delicious), and 2 different rolls, yuzu everything and yuzu. Our food was really good, I recommend the yuzu rolls and the sashimj platter. If the braised beef cheeks ever come back on the menu, it is mandatory to order it.
Waiter was really nice and walked us through the menu, answering all of our questions."}
{"text":"I visited Yuzu No Hana because of the reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto, with an intimate interior and dark wood tables. Since I was dining alone I sat at the bar and I ordered the tuna avocado tartare, which was incredible. I also had the sushi regular chef's selection and that includes 8 pieces of nigiri plus a maki roll for $21. To wash it all down I had one of their Japanese beers. 

The quality of the fish on the nigiri was excellent and dressed very delicately on the plate. The maki was also delicious- so all in all I like! If you're sitting at the bar you can watch the chefs preparing it in front of you in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Pass by this place many times but the entrance is not particularly attractive.  However, saw many great reviews and thought it might be a nice spot to bring my client for an adventure.  Great choice!!!  We all enjoyed the venue, service and food.  Sashimi choices is not limited to the usual salmon but blue fin toro and other delicacy.  I think they use a different supplier than the mom and pop Jap restaurant.  I lunch quite a bit with Ja Bistro but other than the blow torch sushi, I think Yuzu No Hana is way better.  I think this is my new Jap spot now.  Party of 3, 5 order of sashimi (3 piece per order) + 4 rolls + 3 dessert and no beverages (just green tea), total at $150 with tax and tips.  Not bad at all!!!"}
{"text":"Yuzu maki, gyoza, spicy salmon hand rolls, dragon roll, spicy tuna maki, butterfish sashimi (SH), yellowtail SH & o-toro sashimi complete one the best sushi experiences in Toronto. The sauces are tasty and the fish is melt in your mouth.

The bill with a couple sakes and three well fed individuals came to $140 w/ tax and tip

The waitress do not understand and provide subpar service but the maitre'd is excellent."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 sushi restaurants in Toronto (Nami, Take, Solo Sushi Bekkan and Japango being the other 4) Its a small and intimate restaurant making it a good place for dates! Service is also attentive! Love their sashimi, esp uni, butterfish, mackerel and white tuna. Spicy scallop roll is divine. They also have hot soba here too! (Many other sushi restaurants in Toronto dont have it :( )"}
{"text":"I know it is kind of strange! I been recommending people to go Yuzu, even recommending people to take their dates here if one want to impressed them with good Japanese food... and I have not been here until now!!!

Lunch Specials serving till 3:00 pm, great to come here for a late lunch. Restaurant was kind of half empty when I got here around 2:00 pm.

Chirashi Zushi ($17) was excellent. Great mixture of fish and all really fresh. I enjoyed that in silence....... it didn't bring tears in my eyes, but it was good enough!

Black Sesame Ice Cream ($4) was a great finish for my lunch.. I want to try the green tea brulee next time!!!

Service was polite and attentive.

I want to come back and try out other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and fast sushi and sashimi. Well priced, we'll go again."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi--worth the slightly higher price point for the quality.  I try to order the specials but you can't go wrong with the sushi lunch or dinner selections.  Same quality as Japango but here you have a little extra breathing room compared to the former's cramped size.  I can't say much beyond the fact that it's a sure bet for good sushi."}
{"text":"Quiet place to have sushi and sashimi. Love their salmon sushi, very fresh and yummy at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Really underrated and underappreciated. This is the best sushi I've had in the city; I think I come here 2-3 times a month. Granted, I've never been to Kaji, but Yuzu's sushi is consistently super-fresh, well-prepared, and above all, *very* reasonably priced. I usually order the Sushi Deluxe, which for $31 comes with 12 pieces of nigiri and a 6-piece roll of tempura shrimp maki. (Pro-tip -- the same platter is only $25 at lunch.) No fake-crab sticks or smoked salmon to be found here; only high-quality, actually raw fish."}
{"text":"A waitress was so friendly and nice. But I would say it is an average Japanese restaurant. 
I had a Shokado Bento for $20. A tiny piece of Black cod was tasty and Tempura was good and each of Sashimi piece was a OK but thin and small. 
Unfortunately, their white rice and miso soup did not meet the expectation at all. Rice was dry and miso soup was boring and does not have much in it. Worst part was a quality of small salad. Some salad leaves are so old look like served few days ago....

If you are describe yourself an authentic Japanese restaurant, Rice and Miso soup are essentials. Hopefully, Fresh salad, too."}
{"text":"Quality service, food, and nice atmosphere. Only thing was I wish I had more privacy. They we're very nice about helping me with an RSVP."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever.  Love this place. It's quiet and relaxing. Sitting at the bar the chef is friendly and informative.   Great place and thankyou for a great meal."}
{"text":"Took forever to bring the missing tea. I specifically asked for no white fish but had it added into my sashimi order. This place has gone down over the years. It's amazing it's still has 4 star ratings."}
{"text":"The city has so many sushi restaurants, unfortunately many of them are AYCE and many of them are not good (especially the AYCE), so it's refreshing to find a casual reasonably priced Japanese restaurant that has an a la carte menu.

The food and service was very good and the place has a nice relaxing ambiance with the dim lighting and candles on the table.
They have a nice sake menu and the food came out surprisingly fast. The flavours of the sushi was all there and the fish was very fresh."}
{"text":"This place offers adequate sushi but does not afford the least bit of privacy. We had a reservation and, when we arrived, the place was nearly empty. Despite this, the hostess sat us right next to the only other couple in the place and made our table by separating theirs! About 6 inches between the two. It was odd and off putting. The waitress tried to rip me off at the end of the meal by \"assuming\" I was leaving a 50 percent tip, since I paid in cash. This is kind of a tourist area so perhaps its par for the course."}
{"text":"We stepped in here for some lunch and I've got to say I was pretty impressed. I got the  sushi lunch combo that comes with miso soup and salad. The salad was alright, but the miso soup had a more complex flavour than the salty water you get at most sushi restaurants. The sushi was also pretty good overall. The salmon was pretty typical, but they burnt the top of the white tuna which gave it a nice smokey taste. The shrimp sushi did not gross me out for once and the seabream was also softer/fresher than at most sushi restaurants. There was also a piece of fish that I hadn't tried before that was very soft and buttery... halibut maybe? Whatever it was, it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went there to check it out a while ago. She had the kaisendon YUZUNOHANA, which was sashimi, fresh salad vegetables, and spicy house sauce. She loved the spicy house sauce the most. She's had many bibimbaps before, but she absolutely loved how this was prepared. 

While I had the sashimi deluxe, which was the chef's selection, with 21 pieces of sashimi. The best part was that since it was a relatively quiet night, we were allowed to sit at the bar and watch the sashimi be prepared in front of us. I remember the mackerel being my favourite sashimi out of all of them. You can really tell that it's fresh because there are subtle nuances between the types of fish (as there should be!). 

I also had the live scallop, since it was the special of the day. I remember being pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of it. Though, be sure to ask what the price is before ordering, I think one scallop was around $25? Not expensive per se, but it's always good to be aware of the approximate amount that'll appear on the bill. 

Afterwards, we had the sake cheesecake and green tea tiramisu. They were both divine! It was perfectly portioned, so we were left feeling content, not stuffed. 

Now unfortunately both of our phones were out of batteries (what're the chances?) so we didn't have any pictures from our lovely meal. But luckily that's made the meal all the more memorable. We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"We slipped into Yuzu Sushi on a dark and rainy Sunday night. It's a attractive loft space in the Entertainment District with exposed brick, lots of wood, and elegant flourishes in their decor. Definitely a great spot for a date.

Service as particularly attentive that night as it was not very busy. This allowed my date and I to peruse the selections thoroughly. The large menu is separated into categories like hot and cold starters, mains, sushi and sashimi, rice dishes, and noodle dishes. You could also order things à la carte I suppose, but who does that?

Though my DC was skeptical, I was intrigued by the pork belly. Expert call by me. It was tender, flavourful, and fatty -- in a good way.

For our mains I opted for the sashimi deluxe (21 pieces for $35) and my date got the Yuzu bento ($30): a double-decker box with sashimi, sushi, teriyaki and two sides. Picky eaters should note: most sashimi is \"chef's selection.\" I wasn't 100% thrilled about my picks, but I gotta say it was all really solid fish. Very fresh and succulent.

I will definitely return. I'd love to try some of the more experimental options like the oyster shooters, or the omokase, a \"chef designed multiple course meal.\" Neat.

Obligatory Title Pun: YUZU looking at me?

Menu Readability: Century gothic. All right.

Need to mention: Sapporo on draught.

What this place teaches me about myself: It's hard to turn down pork belly. Try me!"}
{"text":"I came here a while back to celebrate a birthday with a friend. After confirming our reservation, we were seated promptly and we decided to go with the 7-course meal as recommended. Like previous reviewers have said, the food is absolutely delicious - the seared tuna salad, sashimi, and sushi were some of the best I have ever had. Although quite expensive, the quality definitely justifies the price. 

Our only problems were with the seating location and the small portions. We were seated at a table that was way too close to our neighbors and that was uncomfortable. In addition, we weren't full by the end of the 7-course meal; the portions were rather small in comparison to other high-end sushi places. All in all, I enjoyed the experience - the food, atmosphere and service were great. I would recommend getting something more filling from the menu if you're looking to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"We came here as group of four on a Thursday evening. My friends and I usually go to JaBistro, but that night we decided to give it a try since a lot of the reviews here say that Yuzu no Hana if not better, will at least be equally good.. 

However, all of us was very disappointed afterwards. We ordered the chef's selection sashimi, but it wan't even half as fresh as the other place. And the signature Yuzu Rolls was just so so. The rest of our order (recommended by the waitress) was even below average. 

Our waitress was not that attentive. It was so difficult to get her attention and the place was not even half full that evening. We each only had one glass of water the whole dinner as she was too busy, and later (after our reminder) forgot to refill."}
{"text":"When you work for the largest unicorn in the world, and meet people who are in the biz, they are happy to meet up and discuss biz. We had a seafood thing going on - last time it was in April and we had dinner in Brooklyn at a seafood joint with a mutual friend in DC, who was, at the precise moment, on a trans-pacific flight back to DC. The two of us decided to continue our tradition of seafood, but this time sushi.

Sushi in Toronto is known to be good but this place is pretty much the best I have had in 2018. Definitely the best outside of Japan. The best deal in my opinion is the sushi and sashimi combo which comes with an appetizer and a clam based miso. We ordered a sake bubbly which was low in alcohol but packed with deliciousness. 

The sashimi has a rich and fresh flavor to it. I find most of the fish when arriving in North America tend to lose its flavor and feel even rubber like texture. This place has super fresh and fatty fish. It actually gave me running induced like endorphins and made me super happy. I need more happiness in my life. The sushi came later, and it had a lot of pieces, complete with uni which was the highlight. I liked how some of the sushi were served pressed style, which was a traditional technique and which you don't see very much any more. In between the fish there were also the fresh wasabi, very nice touch.

I also loved how big the space was. It was a quiet evening and we spent a good three hours catching up and getting to know one another.

I finished the meal a much happier person - this is the effect of having had one of the best meals you've ever had in your life. My faith for fine quality fish has been restored. When I got back to the hotel, I sent those photos to the said DC-bound friend, who had apparently just touched down. He texted me back with \"soooo good.. jealous....\" Always the food photo show off, my mission was accomplished!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my co-workers and there was no lineup. The place was filled with suits. It's definitely an authentic-looking Japanese restaurant, and would recommend this place for dates.

I ordered the chirashi ($18). It was presented in a very nice looking bowl. The rice underneath was very good, seasoned well and the right amount of vinegar. The fish on top was good as well. It comes with 2 slices of fried lotus, 1 raw shrimp, 2 pieces of salmon with sesame seeds, 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of seared tuna, 2 pieces of mackerel, and 2 tamago. The fish was very fresh, and I enjoyed most of it. The chirashi comes with miso soup and a salad. Service was great."}
{"text":"I went to Yuzu No Hana last night for dinner after work. When I arrived the restaurant was pretty empty but within 15 minutes it was starting to get full. 

The sashimi and rolls were fresh and very well made! I would definitely recommend this place if you wanted to do take-out. Their food is fantastic! 

The service on the other hand was horrible. Since we were one of the first people in a pretty empty restaurant you would think we would have our drink orders taken within a few minutes of sitting down. Well, as the restaurant started filling up we noticed that everyone else getting sat around us, not only had their drink orders taken but also already had some of their food being served! After roughly 20 minutes, I had to wave down passing hostess to get someone to come over. Once he came, he took our drink and food orders. The food did come out in a timely manner, but one of the rolls were wrong, and another roll was forgotten. 

When it came to paying our bill, we sat at the table waiting for someone to pick up with bill fold for roughly 15 minutes until we thought maybe we should pay at the front. Once we got to the front we were told someone was to come to the table to pick that up for us.

Very disorganized and really frustrating. But, if you do want fresh sushi, just take it to go and eat in the luxury of your own home!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Dynamite roll was stale and chewy. The service was forgettable. By that I mean they literally forgot about us on numerous occasions and we had to flag them down to order. Then we waited over 15min for the bill which is when I decided to go stand by the till until I got their attention and could pay. It was good but overpriced. I started off enjoying my meal but by then end of it I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"A little late in reviewing but I had a great Summerlicious 2016 lunch experience at Yuzu no Hana with my boyfriend. For $18, it was well worth ordering the Chirashi as it had such a fresh quality of sashimi cuts! Sad that the prices are going up every year for this semi-annual food occasion but there are still a few hidden gems if you go through all the menus! Definitely will come back to try their rolls and leave another review"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night after looking up restaurants of Japanese cuisine. After reading reviews that it was under the same owner of Japango, we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 630pm and there was only one other table seated at the time. We were promptly seated and were given our menus and the specials were explained quite thoroughly. 

We decided to order a dish of Sakura Ebi Tempura (which we were told is not always on the menu), a Yuku Roll, the Sashimi Deluxe, and Matcha Creme Brulee for dessert. Our total came up to around 79$. 

The Sakura Ebi Tempura was unlike anything I've ever tasted. Our server explained that it was made up of sakura shrimp and fried with tempura. The texture was soft and the tempura was fried to perfection. We were savouring each one and didn't want to finish it! 

The Yuku Roll is a torched roll that came with avocado, shrimp, cucumber, and salmon. When it first arrived at our table, the flames were still coming out from between the plates which was a nice presentation. Once it was put out, we dug in and found the rolls to be huge! Each sushi was packed and the perfect amount of sauce was put on top. It wasn't overly torched either. 

The Sashimi Deluxe came with 18 pieces of sashimi. Since I'm writing this review a week late, you'll have to resort to my pictures for the platter make up. This platter was definitely worth the price you pay. Each piece was thick and fresh; I can honestly say that it was one of the best sashimi platters I have ever had (And I usually get sashimi at every Japanese restaurant I go to). Very impressed! 

Lastly, for dessert, we had the Matcha Creme Brulee. If you're a fan of matcha, I would highly recommend this dessert as it was not overly sweet and you could taste the matcha come right through. It was a good end to a wonderful dinner.

The ambience of Yuzu No Hana is quaint and cozy. It got busier near the end of our dinner, but still wasn't loud to the point you couldn't hear your party. The lighting is dim and it makes for a wonderful place to go with your loved ones. 

Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Yuzu No Hana and would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Yuzu No Hana is a Japanese restaurant that attempts to be classy and fancy but sadly falls short.  I have been here twice for dinner, and both times I was unimpressed.  The food is at such a premium price that I would expect better quality.  

The interior of the restaurant is visually appealing, but not accessible.  Stairs need to be taken up or down from the entrance to go to dining.  Service here was okay, I have nothing good or bad to say about it.

On my visit this past weekend, I ordered the Yuzu Bento ($36), which included tempura, sashimi, sushi, salmon or yakinuku beef and chef side dishes.  It came in a two-layer bento box.  I also ordered the Spicy Hokkaido Scallop roll.  Tea was served to us shortly after ordering, which was nice.

When the food arrived, I had feelings of dissatisfaction.  First of all, the tempura was not crispy at all.  It was soft and not at all like how tempura should taste.  Second, the side dishes were very mediocre and not worth tasting at all.  My eating partner and I also did not think the salmon was above anything either of us could make.  The sashimi and sushi were okay.  The roll we ordered tasted like Chinese chili oil dumped over scallop, so we were not impressed with that.  The spiciness greatly overpowered the scallop.

I'm curious to try the lunch, but since I am rarely ever downtown...it likely won't happen.  Save your money for other favourites downtown!"}
{"text":"Very nice sushi restaurant with good service.  Order the chefs selection of different sushi and it was delicious.  Did wish the server would explain the types of fish we were eating or at lease be presented with a list so we knew.  It was beautifully plated with leaves and flowers.  Also order the tuna belly sashimi that just melts in your mouth.  Both the yozu and lobster roll was interesting and tasty. I really enjoyed how both rolls tasted.  The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was a nice touch.  I would skip the masake? Mushroom sushi it was kinda blah compare to the other dishes."}
{"text":"I came in, hoping for the best; motivated by the great reviews and the hype.

I'm extremely disappointed at this restaurant. We made a reservation for 7:45 PM on a Friday, arrived on time and since we got in, it seemed like they were too busy.

Completely understaffed for a Friday, staff non attentive, and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (even though I had a reservation), then another 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order.

Finally the food arrived after about an hour waiting, and while the food presentation was delightful, the taste, was not worth the price tag. 

I ordered the spicy Hokkaido scallop roll, the wafu steak and sake cheesecake.

Overall the food was underrated for such a high price and high valued location. The chef delivered our food, because the waiters were just swamped.

Kept asking for tea, and only got one refill.

Very very disappointed and will not come back again. I hope people see this as a real experience and not fall for the hipster trend."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh sushi, great sake and good atmosphere.  Better than 95% of other sushi restaurants I have been to. It's comparable to sushi in Vancouver, San Francisco and other amazing sushi places.  The servers are nice, but one step behind.  No real complaints.  The price is right for this food.  Get some sashimi, they have big cuts."}
{"text":"Walked in off the street to grab some sushi.  Sat down in front of Mark the sushi chef and had an incredible sushi experience.  Everything was top notch, super fresh and the timing was great too!  Highly recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"My favorite favorite favorite Jap place around work for lunch. I think I go way too too often. My go to dish is their chirashi bowl it's perfect for lunch, just the right amount of food. Everything is super super fresh! 

Their set meals are amazing as well, I love them burdock roots. And when I want to splurge, their uni nigiri, to die for ( I'm personally a huge uni fan, sorry for being a bit dramatic).  

I love dining in for lunch, you don't need a reservation.
It's actually not that busy for lunch at all. Great place to have a nice quiet lunch."}
{"text":"I did not find their signature yuzu roll too salty. Fancy flame action around the plate. They in turn do not have the top flammed rolls. However, very tasty. 
We did also order their blackened cod. WOW delicious and cooked just right, balance of all the flavors went well. 
We did randomly decide on having their black sesame icecream for desert. I believe it is home made - great texture and condensed taste. 
Came here twice already... will do again.."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a quality sushi restaurant that delivers in both service and food. For what it is, Yuzu's prices may seem steep at first but becoming a regular here has taught me to embrace my wallet in satisfying my tastebuds. 

If you're one for sashimi, you can't go wrong with any of their sashimi dishes. Keep in mind their omakase set ($100) needs to be ordered in advance. Normally I call a few days to reserve. The quality and freshness of their fish is always on point. Their rolls are decent in size and very tasty. My favourite from here is the yuzu everything roll; they serve it on a plate of fire. With a good camera, it's quite photogenic. Other favourites range between the softshell crab, smoked salmon, wagyu tartar, unaju, and spicy scallop roll. 

The servers here are always friendly and polite; this is a nice joint for lunches and dinners. Definitely one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Yuzu No Go. We expected better based on the reviews. It was okay, but okay doesn't cut it at these prices. It's not that the prices are sky high, it's that they aren't commensurate with the quality of the food and the service. I've had fresher, better sushi and sashimi for more money and for less.

Seating options include tables, banquettes and sushi bar dining. Multiple servers waited on us, one of whom was less than competent and another who was flat-out rude. 

I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"A very beautiful little restaurant, welcoming and very nice Japanese cuisine.

I had the tasting menu and experienced some wonderful flavors.

I was sick the next day, so not as keen after that."}
{"text":"A delightful restaurant serving Japanese food that is not very expensive but where the sashimi and sushi are fresh and in decent portion sizes. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service dependable."}
{"text":"Tried YUZU while I was visiting Toronto for work after I saw the great yelp reviews... I was impressed!

I had the dynamite roll and the YUZU maki roll. Dynamite was delicious, I ate it up! The YUZU maki has an amazing little show when it's brought over -- the plate is on fire (literally) and stays that way unless you blow it out or wait for a few minutes. The rolls itself, I personally thought wasn't as great as the dynamite roll.

I was intrigued by the green tea creme brulee so I made sure that I saved some space for that... Presentation was nice but I could only finish half of it mostly because towards the second half of it, the green tea flavor took over and it wasn't as tasty as the first bite. The berries help diffuse the strong green tea taste.

Oh and for my drink, I had the Yu-Ki-Hi (lychee and pomegranite with sake). It tasted good but probably could have used a little bit more sake.

All in all, i'll be sure to visit next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"A consistently good Japanese restaurant in the heart of the city.

It's on the mid-tier in terms of pricing, similar to Japango and WOW Sushi. Lower price and quality than JaBistro or Mika. But a dependable choice.

ATMOSPHERE:  The restaurant spreads over two floors, with different dining spaces - so it accommodates single diners, small tables and larger parties (which is GREAT because most Japanese restaurants are so tiny, it's impossible to have a party larger than 10).  Overall décor is dark and sleek.  Have seen all sorts of patrons here, from casual diners to business crowds.

SERVICE:  Very prompt and courteous. Have been here many times and staff is always very friendly, and responsive.  Never have pressured to speed through a meal, but they're attentive enough that you never have to ask for something twice.

PRICE:  Reasonable.  Although, they have gone up over the years - by switching out some of the more pricey ingredients.  For example, the beef option in their Yuzu Bento used to be beef teriyaki, but now it's a much lower quality beef.  

FOOD:  As mentioned its very reliable and consistent quality.  I'm a big fan of sashimi, and they have a great selection here.  I recommend going with the \"chef's choice/selection\" when considering options. It's a bit pricier than the regular option, but you get better cut or type of fish.  Presentation (like Japango & WOW Sushi) is always beautifully set.  So you'll enjoy a feast for the eyes and your taste buds.  

Remember to save room for dessert!  I enjoy their matcha brulée. It's rather soft/runny, but the flavour is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to try out a new place downtown.  Since this was a Japanese restaurant, I used my benchmark dish \"Chirashi don\".

The dish was pretty expensive at $17 before taxes.  However, this is by far the best one I have had.  They even use real edible shiso leaf to separate the ingredients and not the plastic version.

I think it can do with two slight changes.
* change the white tuna to something else.  Not sure why, but I find white tuna just cheapens the dish.
* deep fry the shrimp head, it's such a waste to use it as decoration when it can be eaten.

However, the food quality is so good, it had earned a place in my reasons to go downtown list."}
{"text":"It's nice, fresh sushi and a nice interior, but it's somewhat overpriced for the quality provided.

Food: The sashimi is quite good, the rolls tend to have too much rice compared to fish. The drink selection is much better than most sushi restaurants, and for this alone I'd give another half star if I could.

Ambiance: Interior is more upscale than most sushi restaurants, its low light fits with much of the local scene.

Service is excellent, I've been with large groups and just with one other, and service is fast, friendly and professional.

A nice place overall, but when there's such good sushi for much less not far from here, I can't give Yuzu more than three stars."}
{"text":"Yuzu maki, gyoza, spicy salmon hand rolls, dragon roll, spicy tuna maki... one the best sushi experiences in Toronto. Omakase for me. You'd really want to clear your palette every time you indulge on a different one. However, since it would be rude to bring a mouthwash and gargle between each Omakase dish, I cleared the mouth with cold sake.  Omakase is turning into o-my sake after a few carafes."}
{"text":"My favourite place to come for special occasions. The sashimi platter is incredible, and all of the waitresses and waiters are so polite. I always order the chef's choice for sashimi and I have never been disappointed. The spicy mayo may be an odd thing to rave about, but it is just so good here. It can be a bit pricy but it is very filling and you end up paying the same price for ayce. I've come here multiple times and it never fails to amaze me."}
{"text":"First time here.  Grabbed a seat at the sushi bar because I felt guilty taking up a table as a solo diner.  Here are my impressions:  

Positives:
+ambiance-wise, definitely good for dates but can be a tad noisy.  I could barely hear the sushi chef behind the counter, even from sitting at the bar.  
+service seemed very quick for a weekend night.  restaurant appeared to be half full.  

Negatives:
-Menu seemed diverse in that there were non-sushi items available, as well as the usual creative rolls.  However, all of the raw fish (sashimi) bowls were defined as \"chef's selection\".  In my experience, you can get a bowl of raw tuna on rice just about anywhere.  Well, not here at Yuzu.  I asked a waiter what exactly was \"chef's selection\".. he said it was whatever the chef decided.  (duh!)  Not helpful.
-I happen to enjoy sea urchin.  It's an expensive delicacy and the menu listed sea urchin as $11 for sashimi or $9 for nigiri (on a slab of rice).  I ordered the nigiri option.  Well, this is where I encountered the Bait 'N Switch!  As I was waiting for the food to arrive, the sushi chef explained to me that the sea urchin is actually not $9.  Apparently the menu refers to an inferior version of sea urchin that is sourced from Vancouver... but coincidentally, they have a better version that is \"from Japan\"..  oh, and this better Japanese version costs \"double the price\".  I asked the guy why this wasn't on the menu anywhere..  he said my waiter was supposed to let me know.  Bizarre!  Well, I was really in the mood for sea urchin, so I went with this ultra fancy Japanese version.  
Spoiler #1: it was not that special.  
Spoiler #2: the price was more than double -- $20.
-Wakame salad (seaweed salad) was a joke. Literally the size of a kid's scoop of ice cream.

Weirdness:
? Ordering was a little bizarre.  as soon as I sat down, a young man came to take my order..  I was puzzled by the \"chef's selection\" part (see Negatives above), so I ordered the Wakame salad appetizer and said I'd figure the rest out later.  The guy leaves and then this woman shows up and asks to take my order..  I did not want to cause confusion, so I said, \"Oh, I already spoke with the other waiter.\"  She replied, \"You only ordered the seaweed salad.\"  How does she know this??  So I gave her the rest of my order.  
? Didn't get a refill on hot tea.  I took that as a sign to leave early.  

Overpriced for what you get..  but the rolls weren't bad.  Sea urchin Bait 'N Switch was seriously disappointing.  Avoid the hard sell and just stick with the sushi rolls, which were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came here last month with my boyfriend for our anniversary. I had done a bunch of research and waned to get nice and fancier sushi.

I picked Yuzu based on Yelp reviews.

It was very good overall. The service was good but we didn't have one waiter really, which was kind of odd but whatever.

Everything was delicious but I found some of the rolls a little small. They weren't THAT pricey but I've been to cheaper places with bigger rolls. Also the drink I got wasn't what I expected. It was good but very slushy and half of it was like undrinkable.

The tuna tartare app was amazing. My other favorite was the signature roll which was served on fire. Very very cool.

Overall a great experience and I'm glad we checked it out!"}
{"text":"There are many things that may go wrong while going for a sushi. Apart from the obvious details like parasites in the raw fish, you can get rolls that fall apart as you are trying to grab them, items way too big to enter the human mouth, huge and poorly cut salad leaves, and obviously those classic sticky tables!

Well, I am happy to inform you that none of that is present in Yuzu Sushi. After reading all the reviews, on my very first visit I ventured straight for a chirashi, and that was a bliss. Perfectly clean and fresh fish. Excellent rice - cooked exactly to a point when you can easily grab it with chopsticks, yet not sticky and uncomfortable to chew. Miso was just about perfect and only the green tea ice cream spoiled the final - there was a chunk of ice inside it.

The only reason I did not give Yuzu five stars is their service. Girls were absolutely polite and cheerful, but we had to always - and I mean literally every time! - wave and call to attract their attention. Even though there were barely three tables occupied in a whole restaurant at the moment.

Except for that, I would say that Yuzu is seriously risking to become a default sushi place in \"my\" part of the Downtown - even though they are a bit on the pricey side, you get some seriously good stuff for your money."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and I'm definitely coming back for more!

I love the sea urchin sushi's here, very very fresh and extremely soft. Their salmon roe sushi is really good too: large and lots of it. Their sushi doesn't come apart after several bites, that's important.

The chirashizushi $25 (chef's selection of assorted sashimi on sushi rice) is packed with fresh seafoods: salmon, tuna, clamfish, egg, Actually this is just like other chirashidon, but it's still very very good.

Their tempura udon ($15) comes in a big bowl plus a dish of shrimp tempura on the side. It's actually very filling. I thought the udon tasted quite bland though.. The soup was just okay.

The tenzarusoba noodles (cold soba, $16) were delicious. Comes with a quail egg glued to the sauce bowl's lid with wasabi. The quail egg is cut open at the top, with the egg contents still inside the shell. It looks really cute and fancy! 

The prices on the lunch menus are different from their dinner's. These prices I listed here are from the dinner menu and are more expensive than lunch. 

Service is amazing, maybe I've just had good luck here. They are polite and humble. Unlike Western restaurants, waitresses here did not check up on our table, which was fine. But they make sure we always have warm tea."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night. Sushi and sashimi was excellent (had the sushi moriawase). The Yuzu cocktail was also yummy. The fish was fresh and the sushi well prepared. Service could be improved - as could the co-ordination between the sushi bar and kitchen."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices and excellent sushi. The husband (sushi aficionado) tells me that all the raw treats were some of the best he's ever had. That's saying a lot. Also, they have a poster of Amelie in Japanese on the lower level by the restrooms. I give mad points for Amelie representers."}
{"text":"Came here for a special b-day celebration and it hit all the right notes ~ great food, pretty presentation, friendly professional service. I really could find no fault in our dinner that night. 

We made reservation the day of and were seated right away. We sat at the tables right across from the bar, where there were three sushi chefs that day. It was still early in the night.. 5:30.. but by 7 the place was reasonably full. The tables are a little close together when they're set for couples. I felt like I was unintentionally eavesdropping on our neighbour's conversation even when I was trying my best not to. 

We shared the chirashizushi deluxe ($29), dragon roll($13), tuna roll ($6), and the oyster shooter ($7) for the bday boy.  Pretty sake cocktail and Kirin beer rounded out the order. Oyster shooter came out first. I'm no oyster fan so I passed on this one but I had heard awesome comments about this from random sites. He downed the shooter as one and I let him chew through it all before asking how it was. Contrary to all I'd heard, he just thought it was okay but he wouldn't order it again. Main critique was he didn't enjoy the texture/taste of the completely raw egg. We both love raw egg yolks so I was surprised by that comment, but there you have it. I think the raw egg white is what did it. On to the sushi and sashimi... all the fish tasted really fresh and had good texture. They use shiso to decorate the platter and the wasabi paste they use has a gritty texture that i really like.

Sweet end to the night with black sesame ice cream and green tea cake! As a side note for black sesame ice cream fans, this one is not the super elusive black sesame ice cream. It's the black/greyish one."}
