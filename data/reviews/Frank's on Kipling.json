{"text":"Went here for the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina. The place was PACKED! My family and I managed to get the last group of seats (I think), at the bar. We had the schnitzel with sauerkraut, rotkohl (red cabbage) and home fries. The schnitzel was good and the home fries were delicious. Great beer, too. One of the owner's sons was tending bar; he was awesome. No matter how hectic it got, he was always checking up on us and making sure we were happy. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a day where it was obvious that none of their staff showed up. And the ones that did we're being constantly yelled at by the owner who obviously has anger issues. His mom (I think) was taking our order and she had no idea how to use the iPad to key in orders. What a disaster! The service was terrible, but the food was great! I just kept thinking, \"it must take a lot of patience to work here\". My experiment just reinforced my outlook that the owner of a restaurant should never be a part of its inner workings."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in etobicoke. The food is great (I love the humongous fungus and the pancakes during their breakfast time). The service is always great. Friendly staff and quick meals. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good burger in etobicoke."}
