{"text":"This is my go-to place for everything from an infinite variety of noodles and sauces/oils/pastes to kitchen gadgets and frozen treats.  Need a new pan with which to fry up the enoki mushrooms that you just bought for .99? Try a wok for $20-30, maybe a rice cooker or sushi mat? PAT Central has you covered, and at a good price.   I buy most of my produce across the road but they do have awesome deals from time to time on items that you're unlikely to find in your standard grocery aisle.  Check-out is always enjoyable as the cashiers are super friendly and seem to genuinely appreciate the customers, a vibe that I do not get from the large chains I occasionally visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE this grocery store. I always make sure to pop in here whenever I'm around. The prices here are very reasonable. They have a large variety of korean popsicles and icecream at very good prices. Most are around $1 each. The biggest dilemma for me is always trying to figure out which to try. 

They also sell the super yummy fish shaped pastry with sweet bean paste right next to the entrance. The red bean seems to be the most popular flavour. It's only $1.25 a fish. Delicious! 

They have a large assortment of all your typical asian snack foods such as pocky and chips. 

At the back, you can find prepared foods and sushi. They even have a microwave you can use to heat up some of the foods so that you can eat it right away. 

Although this is a very busy store, the lineups are never too long because there are so many checkout lanes."}
{"text":"...aka 'The Korean Store'.
It's all about the pickles. Who knows you could pickle so many different things?
Love the variety of dried noodles and spices (red chili powder), too.
Rows upon rows, shelves upon shelves... ready to explore!"}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the go-to Korean grocery store down town.

If you compare with the suburban Korean stores, it does fall short in terms of prices, freshness, selection...everything. But if you're living in Toronto with no car, this is as good a choice as any. Well, more like the only choice.

This store does not have a fresh fish counter, so if you want fish, it's the tank freezer for you. It does have a good butcher counter. They will even unpackage and repackage meats for you, if you want a different quantity. These are quite good in quality.

Some of the produce is cheapest here, tomatoes and avocados, for sure. For some other produce, check out Bloor Fruit Market across the intersection.

They do have a points program which amounts to something like $20 per $500 spent in the store. The points program and the flyer are often only offered in Korean-speaking format, so if you are not Korean-speaking, and still want to be treated as a first-class citizen, you better be proactive, and ask about it.

The store also rents space out to a few other small businesses, I think a makeup store (Charmzone), a health food store (red ginseng, etc), a shipping store and, my favourite, the fishcake store (Kevin's Taiyaki!).

If you ever wanted to see 30 different brands of soy sauce, this is the place to see it.

As a discarded daughter of the Richmond Hill/Markham/North York persuasion, this place does leave a bit to be desired, but it could definitely be much worse."}
{"text":"A great store if you need Korean/Japanese grocery, nice pricing, great selection, decent prepared food, Love it!"}
{"text":"This is where I get my groceries since moving to my current apartment. Good price on beef and chicken meats. I love the variety of Korean and Japanese products. Haven't seen the slab of salmon sashimi in a while, though. 

Today I purchased a pack of \"Seasoned Squid and Cucumber\". From the display it seemed very generous in portion. When I got home, pan-heated and ate it, there was barely any squid in it. 3 puny pieces of squid in what felt like 400 grams of its totality. What appeared to be majority of the \"squid\" were some white vegetable (like a radish or something) cut like squid squares to make it look like squid. I felt ripped off. They should have labeled it \"pseudo-vegan seasoned squid\". 

Other than that my overall experience here has been good. I'd come back but won't be buying any of their packed food (sushi and sashimi are ok since I think another company prepares it for PAT).

PS: If you can tell me how to post a photo here, I will put the photo up."}
{"text":"A large Korean market right in Koreatown. Great variety of prepared banchan and everything else you might need. But what puts this over the top is that on the Sunday I went, they were making fresh fish shaped waffles stuffed with either red, green or black bean paste called Bungeoppang. I have never eaten fresh versions of these and they are certainly better than the frozen ones. The batter appears to be made of rice flour since it had the texture of mochi. Definitely worth the trip if they have surprises like these."}
{"text":"Place has some very nice prices of food there! Meat there is very fresh most of the time!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great selection of all of your favorite Asian ingredients. Cheap, relatively spacious, well organized and you can get fish pancakes! They don't contain fish."}
{"text":"If you're not korean/japanese it can be a little confusing, try picking a bag of rice from a wall of like 20 varieties with about 2 words in english! Still, lots of fun for adventurous eaters, get a honey dew Melona ice cream bar and you will not regret it! Free samples of noodles or dumplings is always a bonus and the red bean waffles at the front are delicious. Produce can be hit or miss so double check bloor fruit across the street before you do any major purchases."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a trek from where I live but I ALWAYS make it a point to come up here, especially when I'm making a Japanese or Korean dish and I need the ingredients. PAT carries Japanese/ Korean items that even the big Chinese supermarkets like T&T do not have. PAT has a wide selection and I am particularly fond of their ready made/ ready marinated foods, which is quite typical of a Korean supermarket. Definitely the biggest and the best in the area if you're looking for Korean/ Japanese ingredients! I always pick up my natto beans, bibimbap ingredients, marinated bulgogi, hondashi, etc. here. Not as cost-effective as your typical Asian supermarket like the ones down on Spadina, but it's a great one stop shop if you're looking to make specific dishes that require difficult to find ingredients. Good meats, noodles and condiments selection. Don't expect great service... This is an in and out kind of place and who really goes to a supermarket for service anyway? 

As everyone has said already, don't forget to stop by Kevin's Taiyaki. There's a reason why the custard filled one is 25c more ;)."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean store!  You can find pretty much whatever Korean goodies you are hankering for in here (or at least the ingredients to make those goodies).

Chances are, you'll come out with quite a bit more than what was on your list.  

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm on my way there to replenish my supplies.  ^_*
Everything we make from scratch, they already have there in individual tubs ready for eating; it would make me lazy if my mom didn't insist on the importance of making our goods from scratch.  Naturally, mom's is better, but if I don't feel like doing hours of food prep, there are plenty of ready-made fresh options here.

After reading the reviews, maybe I'll try a fish-shaped bean pastry.  That sounds yummy.  ^_^"}
{"text":"I had the best experience I think I've ever had in a grocery store here today. First time visiting and being very new to Korean cooking, I was trying to look up some essential ingredients. Store manager saw me and despite being busy with deliveries, offered his help and introduced me to the store and explained some of the ingredients I was looking for, helped me make the best decisions for various products considering usage, cost, and quality. I'll be coming here again soon! Excellent place!  In my attached photos, with the exception of the bulgogi and the two sauces, the ingredients were purchased there today and were freshly made in house."}
{"text":"Oh, PAT, with all your kimchi and pickly delights, you put a spring in my step and a stank in my fridge. 

I can shop in nearby Chinatown to stock my Asian larder with soy sauce, soba noodles, and sesame oil. But when I need a taste of the homeland, I make the trek to Bloor Street Koreatown. 

If you wondered who's buying the fire hydrant-sized jars of kimchi, that'd be me. I also come here to get meat for Korean BBQ, dried anchovies for soup stock, doenjang (a miso-like paste on fermentation steroids), Korean chili flakes, and a hundred other esoteric pantry items for the Korean cook. 

PAT also carries a decent selection of Japanese goods and appliances. It's where I bought my trusty Zojirushi rice cooker, the Rolls-Royce of rice cookers."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the tastiest onigiri for $1.50 a piece  and Korean sushi that I used to buy during lunchtime when I was in highschool. Most of the drinks and candy you can get for less at T&T or in chinatown, but it's the premade foods that they carry that draws me back there. And the popsicles! Mmmm melona bars...  There's also a very helpful beauty counter upstairs with very friendly ladies who will smear all sorts of magical korean skincare and beauty products all over you to help you achieve that glowing dewy complexion I call moon face. 

Free parking in the back for 1 hour when you shop there. Enough time to race across the street for walnut cakes!"}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun shopping here for some Asian ingredients...  I don't usually buy the produce but have had great luck with the tsuyu, frozen dumplings and edamame...  they also carry these fantastic melon and ginger candies that I love!!!   Prices are fair and it's just around the corner."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place from the outside! The inside is really great, bakery, great produce, and aisles of decently priced Korean import food. They also prepare things like kimchi, seaweed salad, fried fish, bibimbap, japchae... etc to take home. I make a point to get out here when I can to stock up on authentic Korean food. Also they play kpop over the speakers, wooo."}
{"text":"A reasonably priced asian grocery in Korea town, the veggies are usually pretty fresh, with an ok variety. This place is greattttt for getting shabu shabu thinly sliced meats, they have a wide selection of assorted frozen meats sliced very thin for really low prices. They also have a lot of bulk items, like bulk chili paste for kimchi making.Lots of asian drinks and snacks from China, Japan and Korea can be found here. The Japanese snacks here are cheaper than most other places in downtown Toronto!

The main gripes that I have with this place are that sometimes it is poorly organized and some of the frozen seafood items (like a whole frozen fish) seem very old since you can see the freezer burn on them.

Overall, nice place to get asian snacks and drinks and stuff for shabu shabu at home. Wish they would organize better and remove clearly old stock."}
{"text":"Just back from there 30 mins ago. The food is generally nice but the service was terrible. 
The staffs only smile to customers who are English/Korean speakers. If you are an international visitor/student, they just look like someone died. I'm not so sure that they are not intend to be that way until they mocked and laughed at my face in their own language when I almost accidentally took my debit card off before the transaction was done. 

As a loyal customer, I'm very disappointed and unpleasant. I don't think they really care about losing a customer since the market is so popular, however, I feel sorry for the nasty staffs who never realize they are living in Canada, a multicultural country. I would defiantly tell my friends to love the food from there but also never go there."}
{"text":"Vous aimez la cuisine coréenne ? Vous aimez les mets coréens ? Vous cherchez de la morue salée, des nouilles à la pomme de terre, des châtaignes, des 'pocky sticks', de la racine de lotus en sauce ? C'est ici que vous trouverez tout ce qu'il vous faut. C'est propre, c'est bien éclairé et les produits sont fascinants par leur diversité et leur originalité."}
{"text":"Love it, really good supermarket in Koreatown and has a lot of stuff and the taiyaki there at the front when you walk in iis so good and pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot to stock up on your favourite Korean and Japanese staples.  

The depth of Japanese products is impressive although some of the pricing on them seems a bit steep.  This could be due to the current value of the yen skewing the ratios as I remember them.  Still, I was pretty thrilled to pop open a can of Pocari Sweat (worst named best sports drink EVER) on a particularly hot day.  They also maintain a pretty good selection of the Japanese snack crack, Pocky and Pretz - including the hard to find Coconut/Chocolate Pocky! Oh yeah - I meant to say \"crack\" not crackers - try them - you'll see...

Their Korean product selection is comprehensive, and they seem to have upped their game vis-a-vis the prepared foods lately.  While you may still come across the occasional miss in that department, the hit ratio is waaaaay up from just a year ago.

While Bloor St. Fruit just across the street is my \"Go To\" produce place, P.A.T. does have some excellent pricing on certain items - 2 packs of Enoki mushrooms for $1.79??? I was using them as noodles at that price!  They are essentially mushroom heaven at this point; a reliable source for King Oyster, fresh shitake, and other versatile varieties.

The store is clean (cleaner than any No Frills or Price Chopper I've strolled through...), well stocked, and the staff is actually quite friendly and helpful.  It is now a major stop on my weekly shopping tour!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for grocery stores, when I realized that there was a Korean and Japanese grocery store in the Koreatown - I had to visit. 

I was impressed by their selection of produce and Japanese products. I bought some of their in-house kimchi and it is pretty darn good. I can't stop adding it every meal I have. 

Like more Asian inspired groceries, cramp aisle ways but it was fairly clean inside. 

I will be back for more of their kimchi and other goodies!"}
{"text":"I'm a spoiled ex-uptowner so I'm used to my Foody Marts, Sunny Foodmart, Oriental Marts and T&Ts... But I gotta say PAT is A-OK.
First time visiting this market since I usually end up in Chinatown or the Uptown markets for my groceries.  It's small, manageable and organized. The staff speak a bit of english, but they were nice and all smiles.

I was looking for mochi and fish cakes but some instant ramen and frozen meats caught my interest. As a lazy chef... I like to leave the meat cutting/slicing to other people and I was happy to see frozen pork belly thinly sliced and ready for a simple thaw n grill. They also have sliced beef ribs for Galbi. Fruits and vegetables were ok, but I'd rather go to Chinatown for the variety. 
The Piece de Resistance are the freshly made fish cakes.  As you enter the store, to the left you'll see a lady making these crispy, doughy cakes shaped like a fish but filled with either red, black or green bean @ $1.50 each (5 for $7) or custard @ $1.75 (5 for $8.50). It was about a 10 minute wait to get a fresh batch and it was worth it... So warm, crispy outside, soft inside and not overly sweet... YUMM! This setup operates separately from the market so it's cash only.

This place isn't cheap compared to the other markets I frequent, but I will definitely be back whenever I'm in the area... Especially for the Awesome fish cakes!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  I really wanted to like this place and was super excited to visit, especially based on all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately it just didn't live up to my expectations.

The prices seemed a little high for the prepared foods ... a serving of premade bibimbap was around $5.  The serving was small, there was only a small dollop of red bibimbap sauce included, the vegetables looked kind of wilted and sad, and I don't remember seeing a packaged on or expiry date.  This is kind of expensive considering you can get a much larger serving of fresh bibimbap with unlimited red sauce  and unlimted (depending on where you go) side dishes for $8.  

The pickles and sides section was disappointing too ... a very small container of assorted sides i.e., fish cake, marinated and prepared tofu, etc was around $4 - $5.  It really does seem like more is served in the restaurants ... for free!  I did walk away with a plastic container of kimchi but for $5 I was hoping for more.  Oh well.

Checked out the marinated meats - raw and marinating in their bulgolgi and kalbi sauces - but there was no \"packaged on\" or expiry date either :(  So, we left those alone.

The produce section is not bad ... but not great either.  Prices don't seem particularly cheap and the produce that night didn't seem that great either.

Looked around for a good 10 minutes for a squirt bottle of red bibimbap sauce but didn't see it anywhere ... I am sure it was there but we were in a bit of rush so we didn't have a chance to ask any of the friendly looking gloved ladies.  

Briefly checked out the frozen foods ... particularly the seafood ... and it all seemed a little over priced :(

There is free parking in the back but space is surprisingly limited!  The lot itself is relatively generous but there were only two free spots on a cold, rainy Tuesday night - 1 hour before closing time.  Not sure what the situation would be on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

Really disappointed and had super high hopes since I love korean food and pretty much all things korean related - especially their chopsticks.  Unfortunately there was only one style to choose from and I didn't like that particular style.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"If you are non-Korean, dont bother. This place has the worst customer service! Every time. For instance, I needed an item I could not find, asked someone and he told me to ask the cashier, who pretended not to hear me. Thirty seconds later while I just stood there, she told me she is there to serve customers (I suppose I wasn't) and pointed at another guy. I asked this guy who in turn asked me to ask the cashier who again told me she is there to serve customers! Whoa, what attitude is that? Last month, I picked an item marked at $4.99, but the cashier rang it at $11.00. I told her it said $4.99. She took it, threw it on the other side without a word! Next customer was Korean, all nice and chummy, and I thought she could not speak. I object to this kind of service as it targets non-Koreans and is therefore discriminatory. Period."}
{"text":"Supermarché coréen situé à côté de Christie Station, vous pourrez y trouver tous les produits locaux. A faire si vous êtes dans le quartier!"}
{"text":"Convent and a few things are very good priced. It really has all the necessary stuff for you to make most Asian dishes."}
{"text":"A grocery store on Bloor Street with FREE Parking, Kimchi by the gallon, 82 varieties of noodles, and the best frozen dumpling selection in the City?

I had me at \"grocery store on Bloor Street with FREE Parking\".

Yup...if that's not enough of a reason to shop here...I don't know what is.

BUT, if you need more than FREE Parking on Bloor Street, then consider this: 
- they have some excellent soup and stewing bones with actual meat on them instead of the flavourless, shiny, meatless variety of a standard grocery store (ox-tail, pork neck bones, chicken carcasses, etc)

- Asian ephemera for children including beginner, novelty chopsticks

- An EXCELLENT selection of frozen, Korean dumplings, and other prepared foods

- Frozen seafood coming out the wazoo

- A great selection of exotic chilled drinks

- Asian cooking tools (rice cookers, strainers, pots, etc)

- A decent selection of vegetable matter, include large bunches of mint required for industrial quantities of mojitos

All this can be had with a cleanliness level a step up from Chinatown (doesn't take much), and did I mention FREE parking on Bloor Street???"}
{"text":"Finally! A place where there is asian food sold near by! This place is great because it has a lot of basics for your kitchen including Japanese food as well."}
{"text":"This spot is a old staple in Koreatown. This place is mainly relegated to Korean goods. The space is decently sized but the layout is of a low to mid level grocery store (I guess one is spoiled by the precedent set by Galleria Supermarket) 
All the mainstream Korean items are for sale here (Kalbi, knick knacks etc etc and of course kimchi) The prices are decent from what I could tell. Prepackaged products were decently represented. For the meats from I checked the they a variety of qualities. Seafood items were somewhat limited.
Fresh produce wasn't anything to write home about but decent from what I could see.
The location is decent as it is not that far from downtown so if you don't want to trek all the way to galleria this is a good alternate."}
{"text":"I always come here for korean instant noodles, seafood balls especially fish balls (so fishy!), kimchi dumpling, seaweed, snack and kimchi. However, their kimchi tastes differently every time I buy. Huh so upset :( ya but I'm still coming here lol"}

I have made it a personal mission to introduce as many people as possible to the joy of P.A.T. Let me know if you become a fan!"}
{"text":"Ajummas are so nice here to you and try their hardest to help out and get you to what youre looking for and to communicate to their best ^^

Most korean products you're most likely looking for are here. There are also very high quality sweets that they do sell here but they only restock once a year so keep an eye out and try what you usually don't see cause they're usually really good.

Always love coming here for their freshly made korean sweets! I love their sticky rice delights so much as its something new from my usual vietnamese or filipino sticky rice desserts. Maybe these are an acquired taste however to more westernized palates as my coworkers didn't know if they liked them or not when they tried it. 

However, I highly encourage people to try something new! Maybe you'll like what this place has to offer.

They also have a taiyaki stand which is like a crispy japanese pastry shaped like fish filled with sweet decadent filling and the custard is always my goto! If it's possible always ask for a fresh piping hot one!!! So much better but if you don't mind taiyaki cold and sitting out on display then go ahead heh.

I don't usually buy produce here unless I specifically want korean nappa cabbage or korean green radish and the like (kimchi, glass noodles, buckwheat noodles, or fish more commonly fished in korea) because I go to the Super King Market by Black Creek for cheaper priced things. 

They also have the lovely assortment of drinks that are popular in japan and daily made sushi, gimbap, and triangle sushi by the other end of the market from the entrance which i love browsing for a quick refrshing snack!"}
{"text":"What CAN'T you find here?

I mean, if you're on a mission for forty different types of cheese puffs with names that translate  to dirty deeds, you're in luck.

If you need any product with a bodily fluid in it (hey, it says on the label) it's here.

Kidding aside, you can find almost any vegetable, meat or sauce that you desire here. Some of the meats may be of questionable quality, but the majority of them look ok.

I love this place. Even more, I love the red bean cakes in the shape of fish. 


Even if you don't buy anything, you will have fun here!"}
{"text":"PAT MARRRRRRRT!
Sometimes I come here before I go out for Korean food to wet my appetite
Sometimes I come here after I've had Korean food in K-Town to buy more food.

And sometimes I come here to buy a MASSIVE 4 FOOT TALL BAG OF FORTUNE COOKIES FOR 10$!!!

And other times I just want a can of cola.

The end."}
{"text":"MMmmm, you should definitely find the chance to come here and have their fish-shaped cakes right when they're fresh off the grill!! I've come here before when it was unfortunately a slow day so they only had pre-made cakes, and I gotta say, those ones are nothing in comparison to having them served hot and fresh. 

Of the times I've come here, I've only had their custard filling and honestly, I don't think I want to try other ones because it's just so delicious! The custard has a very subtle sweetness to it that's not overwhelming or artificial, and it's so creamy and smooth! The fishie cake is cooked to the perfect light crunch, and then insides are gooey and soft. 

This is a great snack to treat yourself to if you ever frequent this area!"}
{"text":"Kinda grotty, and quality can vary widely. Alot of things were just fine

Also rather limited selection, I came with a grocery list, looking to find Korean ingredients I couldnt get nearby to me, but left with about half the items. Asked staff for help, but they were unable to help. Would come back, but not impressed."}
{"text":"Aaaahh all different types of daifuku!!! Also try Kevin's taiyaki! YUMMMMMY"}
{"text":"It's a full sized grocery store with great selection for all of your Asian cooking needs and very reasonable prices. 
   -Free Samples sometimes
   -Great selection of frozen and fresh dumplings (I always have a bag or two in my freezer)
    -Really cheap chicken breasts
    -Big tubs of kimchi
    -Affordable produce
    -Very organized compared to the Asian groceries in China town
    -Helpful staff
Check it out, I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"EWWW!!! I bought a large container of their home bran PAT kimchi and I became violently ill after eating it (vomiting, diarrhea). I was sick for TWO days after eating their kimchi. I can't even THINK of kimchi anymore. I cringe and hurl every time I think of it. This place seems like it carries a lot of things, and their little fish bean cake thing smells great but the place is filthy. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought food that was made here.  I honestly can't even think about it, I get so sick each time. I don't even think I could step foot back into this filthy place again for a looong time because of how violently and acutely ill I got from eating some of that filthy, disgusting kimchi."}
{"text":"A great market selling a bunch of Korean and Japanese goods with a very cheap price. The staffs are very welcome. There is a small booth at the door selling taiyaki. There are a bunch of flavours. Green tea, red bean, black sesame, and custard. You can choose a mixed flavour for your taiyaki. And if you buy more, they will offer a discount for you. The red bean is the most delicious one and it's the most popular one."}
{"text":"Now I have a bias, I LOVE Korean supermarkets in general. This market offers not only Korean food but have Japanese as well. But anyways, I am crazy and all about the snack aisle. They have giant pocky (sometimes...expensive but worth it?), meji snacks etc. I like looking at the bakery aisle too for the doriyaki and other sweets. What can I say, I'm a sucker for anything sugary. I will suddenly walk faster than I usually do and become super miss power walk when I know a bakery of some sort, or something sweet is nearby.

I try to come here not too often because I end up buying food I REALLY do not need. But hey, once in awhile is alright. I usually like to pick up rice crackers. I'm talking about the Arare sakura shape looking rice crackers in a hot pink package (see snack aisle). I like to also buy Maxim gold instant coffee sticks because it's THE best instant coffee in my opinion. Just the right amount of cream, sugar etc etc and probably other really bad ingredients but who cares. Instant coffee! 

OH and who can forget the ramen aisle. All you instant ramen lovers, you know who you are, the best ramen choices you can get is at  Korean/Japanese supermarket. They have WAY more options and types. I like the bibim (sp?)men (cold ramen), or the kaljusu (sp?) (clam), or the super super spicy flamey looking one that burns in my mouth but whatevs....SO GOOD!

I recommend bringing cash here too, because I spend more than I should. But come visit on occasion, they really have some neat food here."}
{"text":"They certainly got quite the selection here, compared to their tiny Spring Garden location in my neighbourhood. Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. The meat prices are good too. 

I honestly did not buy anything partly because I was overwhelmed by the lineups. They did not anticipate enough space for people lining up when they set up the store. The customers almost blocked the inside aisle. 

Nevertheless, this Korean supermarket is worth checking out. Just avoid coming during the rush hour."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place! My family is Korean/Japanese Canadian from the west coast and we just moved here. We are in North York and haven't even been able to find anything more exciting than instant ramen as far as Asian foods go which is weird considering all the Asian students at the University up here...but they are the ones who told us to go to PAT...it takes over an hour to get there from the university on a bus and two subway lines but it is worth it!

Here is what we were excited about: 
TOFU! (non-GMO available) all Korean & Japanese styles!
Various types of KIMCHI! (various Korean spicy pickled vegetables)
fresh BULKOGI (thin slices of Korean marinated spicy beef) 
Saeng Sun Jun (Korean pan-fried fish dipped in egg) - freshly made
Haemul Pajeon (Korean seafood pancake) - like Okonomiyaki
dduk/tteok (Korean rice dumpling for soup/nabe (hotpot)
Kamaboko (Japanese fish cake)
Miso paste (Japanese soup base) with dashi (soup stock)
Wakame (seaweed/vegetable for soup or salad)
Konbu (seaweed/vegetable for soup /nabe base)
Nori (dry roasted sheets of seaweed/vegetable for sushi & rice)
Furikake (dried Japanese seaweed/vegetable sprinkles for rice topping) 
Ochazuke (dried Japanese sprinkles for rice topping with green tea)
Umeboshi (pickled Japanese plum)
Noodles  - Japanese ramen, soba, somen, udon, etc wonderful variety!
Ponzu - Japanese dipping sauce 
Raw royal jelly honey - very tasty & healthy
Senbei/okaki - Japanese rice crackers & other salty Asian delights
sake (cooking), shoyu & mirin - essentials for Japanese cooking
RICE - brown rice, sushi rice, raw & ready to eat
TEA - many varieties of Japanese genmaicha, ocha, etc
Asian fruits & vegetables - like Fuji apples, nappa cabbage, daikon (radish), persimmon, shiso (perilla leaves), gobo (burdock root), etc
Asian meat cuts - like thinly sliced pork belly & short ribs for nabe 
Asian seafoods - like fish roe, squid, octopus, etc
AND all the stuff listed by Andrea W. and others below!

plus Asian non-food items like:
Reflexology slippers
Metal Korean-style chopsticks & spoons
Wooden/laquered Japanese -style chopsticks
Rice bowls
Tea sets
Teapots
Exfoliation towels
Shampoo & Conditioner
Pots & Pans
Storage containers
Rice cookers as mentioned below - like the fabulous Zojirushi which is expensive but will last forever!

We went to the shop on a busy, rainy, Saturday afternoon and found taste samples of pan-fried tofu, dipping sauces, Korean sausages, etc that were very nice. Everything we bought from the fresh foods were just like home-made and very fresh. We were very happy with the prices because we cannot find these items so easily & Chinatown or T&T are even further away. We spent $100 and were offered some specific items to add to our groceries for more discount,  so we got a box (20 pkgs) of Nongshim instant ramen for $9."}
{"text":"below average everything

meat and produce low quality, my dduk tasted like freezer burn..

been here numerous times only bc of the convenience of location to buy some korean goods, but i really am not planning on going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place deserves top marks just for location. Asian supermarkets seem to hate being on a subway line. This one is just a minute from Christie station. A few years back when I was visiting Toronto as a tourist rather than living here I would always stop here to buy things like sea tangle (kelp) noodles or shirataki noodles that I couldn't get at home. Now that I'm working through a Korean food addiction I'm finding PAT Central a regular stop again to pick up things like gochujang, doenjang, and banchan. The selection is great and the prices are pretty much on par with the harder to reach markets like galleria or T&T. I find PAT a little cramped and disorganized compared to others, but again, the location makes up for it. The other thing that makes me wild for this place is the little taiyaki booth. Those fresh fish shaped waffles stuffed mouth to tail with sweet red bean paste are sooo divine. And for a buck fifty they are a steal."}
{"text":"Huge variety of items for sale. A lot of brand variety as well. The prices are pretty nice, especially considering where it's located. Also contains a taiyaki shop called Kevin's Taiyaki."}
{"text":"If you want to get a PAT on the head, a PAT on the back, or - like me - a PAT on the bottom, don't come here. Koreans tend to be very respectful and keep their hands to themselves. Unfortunately.

However, like the other Asian and World and Ethnic grocery stores that are popping up all over North America in all the major urban hubs, this place is perfect for finding all of the great imported and rare stuff that you can't get anywhere else.

Service is friendly, and best of all, Kevin's Taiyaki is on site, in the NE corner by the street, near the entrance, facing into the store. Get a custard thingy in the shape of a fish. It's hot and yummy and perfect.

I'd run here and eat it while I PANT. It's almost a PART of me now. I've had it a few times in the PAST. It costs a PALTry Canadian dollar or two. Five stars."}
{"text":"Walked through, typical Korean market.  Pricey sesame oils stood out, that's about it.  But let's move on to the main event - the fried fish shaped waffley things from the stall at the entrance.  

The custard one, I recommend if you don't have cash, bring your first-born - it's 6 stars and worth pawning something you'll possibly regret later.  Get it and find a quiet spot to be alone with it - don't ask questions, just go.  The red bean one on the other hand wasn't quite as good - still ok but more like a 3.5.  

Custard fish all the way - I'd come back just for those.  Already making mental plans.."}
{"text":"I've frequented this place a lot recently (now that I moved not too far away) and its a great place to stock up not only for Korean products, but there are a lot of Japanese products on offer. 

The staff are very helpful and everytime I visit I see more non Koreans frequenting the place. Though there's plenty of great produce (fruits and veggies) there seems to be more and more competition from the place across the street. But again...this is a Korean grocer! Great varieties of sweets and kimchis of every sort. There's also home-made stuff which lists if one uses fish sauce or does not (helpful for the vegetarians) for the generic napa cabbage kimchi."}
{"text":"I love you, PAT Central. Thank you for keeping me fed and happy for the past three years. I shop here almost exclusively as the prices are fantastic, the produce is fresh and great quality, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. You will find everything you need here for all your Korean and Japanese cooking, and also many Chinese items too (sometimes they even get Chinese greens like gai lan, but they sell out fast).  I basically live off their homemade kimchi. Extensive selection of mixed grains and dried goods (mushrooms, mountain greens). Take it from a 2x a week regular shopper: PAT is really all you need! Pro tip: apply for a points card and start earning points!!"}
{"text":"On the outside the store looks kinda...well...not very enticing...looks drab with posters everywhere on the outside.

Inside it's bustling, they have a \"bakery\" there but it's baked goods sent from another place.  The bread isn't the freshest as if you would get it at the bakery but if you need something then I guess it's ok.  It's like getting the T&T chinese baked goods at Loblaws, you know it's not fresh from the same day but if you have a hankering for baked korean goodies...

Anyhow, we wanted to get a ramen but pretty much almost most of them were moldy.  That's right, spotted with mold.

I'm giving this place 3 stars because there's a fish cake place (not fishy) at the front of the store. Guy running it wasn't exactly pleasant but he was quick and efficient.  I'd recommend getting the custard filled ones, they are piping hot and resemble a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Pure nostalgia and sentimentality brought on by the fish cakes earns this place a special place. The red bean filling is a classic and they did a good job of keeping the outside sufficiently crisp while putting enough filling to keep the whole cake from being too dry. The custard filling is more of a novelty for me but it did with. I'd go back in a heartbeat on our next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"I could not live without Korean food, as it is ingrained into my DNA. I have physical withdrawals when I don't have Asian food at least once a week - the powerful craving for kimchi and the like cannot be ignored...for long (we're talking like, 3 days). 
I don't think I would survive without this store -it doesn't matter which end or part of the city I live, I visit it at least once a month to stock up on my supplies of premade food where you need to just add rice (like the bibimbop) - perfectly healthy and cheap lunch options -and side dishes. It's true that the side dishes don't come in huge servings but you're not supposed to eat the side dishes in one sitting or anything. I usually spend about $80 here and the supply lasts me about a month - I'd say a good deal overall.

I love the fact that they have prepared packages and also have the ingredients available for those who are more - apt in cooking. Korean food I find, is hard to cook for one, since it's mostly made in batches, and are time consuming - so I appreciate the packaged goodies. There's a decent selection for the more health consciousness and some prepared cooking \"kits\" which I love for days when I feel like \"cooking.\"  
As a Korean that can't really cook - I love this place. It has everything I ask for, without going to Korea."}
{"text":"PAT is really a great place for a mix of asian products. Loads of Korean options, cheaper prices than dedicated Japanese stores like Sanko and with the produce selection of any Chinatown fruit market. 

It's tough to knock PAT for anything, except maybe not having the freshest selection of produce on hand at all times.  Cashiers at the front are quick, although don't always expect too many smiles and the place is relatively clean. Prices are definitely in your favour shopping at PAT compared to almost every other super market in Toronto, which is one benefit to visiting, even if you're not buying asian products specifically.

Recommended if you're in the area, or if you're looking specifically for a hard to find product."}
{"text":"The other reviewers have covered most of the stuff (great variety of Korean foodstuffs, not-the-best produce section, frozen everything), but I like PAT Central Market because it carries items for more health-conscious Korean food eaters: Everything from additive-free soybean paste to brown rice powder for making rice cake to mugwort powder - stuff I haven't been able to find at the shinier, sparkling H Mart.

I like it!"}
{"text":"Great market to pickup Korean essentials.  We bought a huge container of Cabbage Kimche for a reasonable price as well as marinated Bulgogi.  If your a Korean food addict this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Largest supermarket in Koreatown, selling all your Korean needs.  Some items include gojuchang, some premade Korean side dishes, and miso paste. . 

After shopping or while shopping treat yourself to a taiyaki!  It's a fish shaped pastry, with your choice of filling."}
{"text":"I know that you used to be alive and in the ocean, Mr. dried out fish.

But now you've found a much better home.   A place where you're truly appreciated.  A place to hang out with all of your dried fish friends.

What a fascinating store."}
{"text":"Apart from their produce and nice cheap ready to eat korean meals, this is the only place where you can find nice fresh fish waffles in Toronto! 
Those fish waffles are warm, crispy on the outside and nicely soft inside, with a good amount of filling. This quality is also consistent whenever I get this pastry there."}
{"text":"PAT Central is a big reason that I want to live at Bloor & Christie. I will say that yes, I am a white girl fascinated by Korean food, but that's a minor reason why I like this store. It's just a good grocery store. You can get nice fresh produce, noodles, rice, yummy frozen stuff, desserts, and more, and the prices are really, really good for such a trendy part of town. If I move to where I think I'm moving to, I'll miss being able to bike here."}
{"text":"Oh man, PAT Central Market, we have just met but I love you.  

While I am not all that familiar with Korean ingredients and food aside from the basics, your ample supply of Japanese ingredients and foods makes me extremely happy (especially since J-town is so far away and Sanko is very expensive).  

I have begun to try some of the prepared/frozen foods: the Korean version of dashi-maki tamago, your delicious varieties of kimchee, and various dumplings, and so far I'm loving all of it.  

PAT Central Market, you're my hero."}
{"text":"Lots of selection for a good value. You can find pretty much anything you need here and more! It is never overly crowded here. Try the fish shaped waffles with custard, my Son tells me they are yummy!"}
{"text":"There are some things in life which are familiar and comforting.  I agree with an earlier reviewer, it is nostalgic and sentimental.  I am not Korean, but I have spent a significant amount of time in Korea, speak the language and eat Korean food.  This place brings back such precious and wonderful memories.

They still, to this very day, carry a huge variety of meticulously prepared panchan, my favourite perilla leaf (gaenip kimchi) and other delights.  Tons of Japanese and Korean snack foods.  Fruit and vegetables are a bit on the expensive side but they carry good organic ginger and my all-time favourite - Korean pears ...

This is truly my happy place."}
{"text":"PAT Central Market is a treasure trove of Korean grocery delights. The average gwai lo won't have the faintest idea what to do with most of the stuff in the store, but that makes it all the more fun. Prices are reasonable and the store is clean and well organized.

They've got you covered for most of your East Asian grocery needs. There's an impressive variety of noodles and nori. Lots of sauces and condiments. The frozen section has a good variety of dumplings and other delights; lots of vegetarian options are available.

 There's also a ton of other stuff that I've yet to try or am not really interested in. In the former category are all the Korean candies and sweets. In the latter category are tons of thinly sliced meat, frozen fish and seafood, and massive vats of kimchi.

The produce section is fairly weak in my opinion. If they upped their game in this respect I'd shop here more often and likely give them another star.

Note that this is a Korean store so, while there is some overlap with other Asian cuisines, if you're looking for specific things from Chinese or Southeast Asian cuisine you may be out of luck. For example, I find that I have to head down to Chinatown to pick up my Thai curry paste.

Things to keep an eye out for:
-Check the freezer to the right of the entrance for delicious Melona popsicles, ice cream sandwiches, and other frozen goodies
-There's a section of maple flavoured cookies and candies, which I assume is specifically meant for Koreans wanting to bring back souvenirs from Canada.
-The women at the cash always wear gloves. I've never seen this before at a grocery store. Is this a Korean thing?"}
{"text":"Gosh where do I even begin... there is nothing like this in Oshawa so whenever I'm in Toronto I throw down easily $400 in grocery here to bring home. The pre-made jap chae and kimbap are amazing, the staff are really helpful and the selection is out of this world. I used to go to E Mart, but once I found PAT there was just no going back!"}
{"text":"3* for the quality of the fruits & vegetables, 4* for the selection of other groceries, 5* for the delicious taiyaki in-store. 
=4* overall.

If I ever come by here I always drop by to have a custard taiyaki it's soo good everyone must go try it."}
{"text":"Big, clean with a great selection of meat, produce, and Asian foods, mainly Korean. I got sushi making stuff, kimchi, and bibimbap at great prices! They also had asian pears, dragon fruit and those giant Korean apples! 
  Also, a great selection of soysauce, sesame oil, seaweed, etc. at decent prices. Free parking too."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Annex, I always pop in whenever I'm in the neighbourhood. A bit overpriced, vegetables and fruits sometimes are not so fresh, but sliced meat, kimchi, and already made food are good go-to's.  Kevin's Taiyaki is by the entrance, another sweet excuse for my regular visit."}
{"text":"There are many great things about PAT, let me share some with you:

The Drinks Selection: My favourite thing to do is to go their and pick out a random one and find out what it tastes like. It's like an adventure in your mouth for under two bucks.

Those Melon Popsicles: They have them there by the box and if you buy one, you get to do this scratch and win type deal and if you win you get a free box. THEY'RE SO DELICIOUS!

Tasty goodness: A great place to find all your Asian cooking needs. Bulgogi? Yes please. Kimchi? Okay! Noodles? I'll take every kind!

Also, it's close to Hodo Kwaja so it gives me a good excuse to also pick up some delicious walnut cakes."}
{"text":"In terms of prices, most items such as pre-made food, frozen food, vegetables and fruits are cheaper than Galleria uptown. They have so many kinds of tea from other countries such as China and Japan. They also have a greater selection of snacks than Galleria uptown.

This place used to be cleaner; it's not as clean anymore. Always crowded and busy."}
{"text":"PAT Central Market is a lot of fun, especially if you are white (because you can browse the aisles wondering WTF everything is!)

I come here more to browse than to actually buy much, but I do stock up on my fav Korean ingredients (Korean hot paste, kimchi, bulgogi meat, etc). I also sometimes come in here when the white people grocery stores are closed to pick up essentials like chicken breast and fruit/veg.

I'm sometimes not impressed with the overall cleanliness of PAT, sometimes it seems a little grubby/unclean, but this seems to be normal for most Asian grocery stores I've been to (with the exception of that giant superstore one down by the Docks)"}
{"text":"I don't shop here often but when I do, it's always a good experience. As soon as you enter, you can smell the aroma of freshly baked fishie cakes. It's a treat every time. 

PAT supermarket is very clean and organized. The staff are friendly despite an occasional language barrier. There's at least one person fluent in English. The produce is fresh and the prepackaged items are nice. Limited seafood but they have a wide range of meat selection. Snacks galore! I love trying the different Korean goodies."}
{"text":"My go to place for all things matcha!!! Match kitkat, match tea and match mochiiii!! The ready to eat section has a good selection of dumplings, noodles and marinated meat. It may be a little overwhelming for first timers but the staff is very helpful! Get a custard fish shaped waffle thingy (taiyaki) on your way out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I think it's fair to say that Toronto is a pretty easy place to make bad choices. I swim at Sunnyside and I get maybe-ebola. I try to swim laps at Trinity Bellwoods and end up sitting on the grass drinking beer and accidentally flicking cigarettes at dogs and causing anger. Etc. The city is full of little regret holes, waiting for you to fall into them. Not so at P.A.T.
Most of the ladies at P.A.T. wear comforting aprons and have great eye makeup. P.A.T. creates the option to eat $3 bibimbap vegetables as a bonefide meal almost every day, and to replace your previous liquid creamsicle (beer and orange juice vanilla ice cream float) with an opaque white pop called \"Milkis\". They also have $1.24 bottles of Korean Ginseng, which are a good way to complete no sentences for 8 hours, and really excellent frozen dumpling selection."}
{"text":"Where do you find black sesame seeds you ask? At PAT central I tell you. 

Now you know where to get what looks like mini watermelon seeds when making jello shots that look like watermelon slices. Google it. You're welcome.

This is also a good place to get kimchi by the gallon. Yes, the gallon.

Oh, and the fish waffles don't contain fish. Or so the poster says."}
{"text":"This place is a dream. Other than taking me back to my greatest memories to date, which included frolicking the streets of Gwacheon with a fishcake in hand, it is also the friendliest supermarket in Toronto. It's the perfect place to buy noodles, seaweed, Korean sauces, and many, many, many Korean goodies. Today I was buying ingredients for Soegogi miyeokguk, a delicious seaweed soup, and one of the ladies working at the shop helped me pick the seaweed, the sauces and the cut of beef. She literally went through my basket and told me what I should buy and what I should replace. What a sweetheart! 

Some things I would hesitate to buy: fruits, veggies and meat... I'm a true believer in supporting the local economy and buying seasonal foods. WE NEED TO SUPPORT CANADIAN FARMERS! I also believe that North America has poor laws pertaining to meat and meat distribution so I don't usually buy mystery meat. The meat here does't have any info on where it's from (it's not written in English) and how it was raised. Today my desire to make soup overpowered my morals so I purchased beef brisket...

This place is a short walk from Christie Station and it's cheap! Visit! Visit now!  

PS. THEY SELL HOMEMADE KIMCHI -- all kinds of kimchi! And bibimbap ingredients! So so good! Be prepared to carry a lot of groceries home!"}
{"text":"WOW.  Can I just say that this place is Kim Chee heaven?  I walked in and saw the back refrigerated case, and I thought I had died and gone to fermented heaven.  Everything from 250kg tubs to 10lb bags.  Count me in!  I would one day like to return for all the prepared foods as well.  

Also, I am not sure what people mean about the staff being rude here.  I found the cashier I had was super helpful and friendly!  I will return again, if I find I need some Korean food supplies."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite food-places to visit downtown. I mean c'mon, you can pick up a warm fish-shaped waffle filled with bean paste (Taiyaki) before (or after) you shop. And I always do. 

There's always cool imported frozen sweets from Japan and Korea to gawk at. 
A huge selection of dried noodles, sauces, pastes, etc. 
Love the prepared food section. When i'm feeling concurrently korean, and poor, I can always count on a huge container of Japchae waiting for me at the back of the store. And of course, there's the cheap containers of sushi (admittedly,  not always fresh.)

And I can never resist buying one of them packaged korean buns/baked items by the front cash."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  It'd be 4 or more if I shopped here much more. 

I'm happy to come here on occasion to pick up certain goods - organic (JAS) frozen fermented natto beans, a quick veg sushi lunch for $3.99, seasoned seaweed sheets...

If you find yourself coming here on a regular basis, there's a free PAT Central membership card that you can sign up for, and amass points.  I've seen shoppers in line ahead of me receive a free club-pack size of ramen noodles packages, gratis.

Prices seem fair, the aisles aren't crowded.  They specialize in Korean groceries, dried, fresh, and packaged.  They also offer other Asian goods, and general \"Canadian\" goods like OJ, milk, canned fruit salad."}
{"text":"Korean grocery store on Bloor.  It's a cool place with many interesting Asian products.  I always ended up buying fruits there as they have good deals.  But my favourite is the little section where they make desserts.  Those desserts are called Taiyaki.  I can only describe the dessert as a warm soft cookie in the shape of a fish with fillings in the middle.  My favourite filling is custard, but you can choose from red, green, and black bean pastes.  They make this dessert there so it's fresh and delicious.  A must try if you are in Koreatown."}
