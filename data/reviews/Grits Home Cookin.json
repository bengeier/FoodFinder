{"text":"Love them! Great food! Only thing missing is maybe some tunes! Don't be thrown off by the interior. You can tell this place was built on love!"}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall restaurant.  Home cooking at its finest!  The biscuits are awesome and the service is great."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They give you a lot of food for the money.  Everything is fresh and made with love.  People are nice.  They don't have a dishwasher so they use plastic everything. It is not fancy at all and they don't try to be.    They just serve up good hot food cheap and fast.   They have drive thru window too so you can just call ahead and drive in a pick up u r food."}
{"text":"The interior is nothing to look at, but this place is a true gem! The employees are incredibly kind, and the value for what you receive cannot be beat.   There is no set menu, you check out their facebook page to see what the daily specials are.   https://www.facebook.com/Gritshomecookin/  Generally for $6.99 ($7.99 weekends) you get tea, an entree, two sides, and a dessert. You will not go home hungry. They also have a drive-through option.   They rotate options often so it's not unusual for them to run out of popular things, you have to be flexible. The desserts are always killer, but some of my favorite entrees have been Garlic Parmesan Wings, Chicken Tenders, and a Casserole they make with hamburger and sliced potatoes. Everything is homemade, so it's similar to eating at a friends house....but with plastic cutlery.   They are only open for dinner Thursday- Sunday, so I always recommend calling. If you're in the area I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Grits Home Cookin' is just adorable...it's a little hole in the wall but you will get A+ service and totally delicious home cooked soul food. They've got all the essentials; fried squash, fried okra, peach cobbler, sweet tea, catfish, livers, pork chops, burgers, potatoes (fried, mashed, tots), and on and on. Everything's house made so you really cannot go wrong - it's all good. We purchased three meal deals (under $8 each) and got bottomless sweet tea, 3 different meat options, 6 sides, and 3 desserts. We couldn't believe the price and it was totally delicious. They've got a house made honey mustard dipping sauce and I couldn't get enough of it...I was dipping everything in it. They make their chicken strips and nuggets super fresh; breast meat (not frozen), house made batter, clean oil. You'll taste the difference at Grits Home Cookin' and your wallet will thank you. The only thing they're missing is beer and wine. We enjoyed the small outdoor seating area and were happy to see a good supply of high chairs.  Check this place out next time you're in Waxhaw!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, fast and friendly service. Recommend stopping by if you are in the area. Haven't tried their lunch menu but I will be back."}
