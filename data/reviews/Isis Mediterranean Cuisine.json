{"text":"This one's located a bit north of the other Streestsville shawarma places (Pita Nutso, Osmow's, Taj Wrap, etc). The prices however are good (same as the other Streetsville ones pretty much) and the shawarma wrap itself is great. I wouldn't say the shawarma wrap is better than Pita Nutso or Osmow's, it might be on more visits but good enough for me. The sauce they use isn't as good which is probably why but it does have a unique taste and sometimes I enjoy it more. The chicken has a nice flavour though I'm not a big fan of the basmati rice they use for their platters (I prefer the normal thicker rice) however that doesn't matter if you're just ordering a wrap.

What I found interesting was how this restaurant is set up. Unique little area with a bunch of interesting looking decor...I think it's actually Egyptian and not middle-eastern.

The other thing that makes this place different from the nearby shawarma places is that it's more of a small restaurant rather than fast food mainly cos of the menu. It includes stuff like babaganoush and some other stuff I don't understand on the appetizers, biryani which I'm fairly sure is actually an Indian dish, they have different types of shawarma plates (prices on these are a bit high though), and other than the regular shawarma...they also have a burrito shawarma, cheesy, Hawaiian or whatever. I haven't tried them out because when I went there, I didn't look at the menu but will give it a go later on.  On the shawarma itself, he also uses a stir-fry of some sort rather than the usual vegetables (I usually ask for no turnips/pickles though). 

Anyways, their shawarma isn't noticeably better than the other places but the other things on there menu make me wanna visit again.

EDIT: I was looking at the facebook page, their website doesn't show much but in the photo album there's a picture of some of the foods and you'll know what I mean when I say it looks interesting. Food always looks better in those pictures though. Menu has also changed a bit, I've uploaded the menu brochure onto here. Also apparently they deliver if your order is above $25."}
{"text":"Its never occurred to me until now why this place changed their name. I've only ever seen the same 2 employees there no matter what time or day of the week I've been. They raised their price for a shawarma wrap by a whole dollar which isn't very good value for what you get (6.20 compared to Osmows which is 5 dollars exactly and Osmows wraps are gigantic). They have a \"Spicy Mashed Potato Samosa\" which is divine. I've only ever ordered samosas or chicken in a wrap here. Samosa is 5/5 shawarma wrap 4/5. Not much variety for what you can put inside but sometimes less is better. I usually order shawarma with just chicken and sauces with no vegetables anyway wherever I go"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Shawarma's are delicious and so are the falafels. I sometimes get one of each. My buddy took me here and its been my to go place for lunch ever since."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and I have to say that it was a big disappointment again..i don't mind paying for food but this place is trying to sell you rice with a little bit of meat for 12 bucks plus tax?!?! Dont get me wrong but i think its a ripoff! They are much better options to eat .."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite place in Streetsville for a shawarma.  My major complaint here is that the guy has no menu available, and when you ask him what he has he just says \"shawarma\" as if thats all they sell.  If you ask for rice, he does have it in the back.  If you ask for falafel, he will make it.  So why does he only try to sell shawarma and nothing else?  I just don't get it..  It's more like walking into somebody's living room rather than a shawarma place because there's no menus and no mentions of food anywhere!  Very confusing choice by the guy here, I don't get that at all..  

but aside from that, the shawarma is very tasty and I have always enjoyed my food from here.  Go liberal on the hot sauce because it's pretty mild, and there's always bottles available for every table which is nice as well for sauce-a-holics

Very affordable, but beware the hours, seems to always be closed as soon as it gets dark out, definitely the shortest hours of all 5 shawarma places in Streetsville"}
{"text":"This is a very small joint now called \"Shawarma Hut\" for obvious reasons. But the shawarmas are amazing. Specially there homemade spicy sauce, which I think is a combination of franks hot sauce and some creamy tzatziki sauce. I can just put that sauce on rice and eat it. They usually have specials on shawarmas like 2 for 11$ which is not bad, one would probably fill you up and the service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has come here quiet often during the lunch time rush. Anything with the shawarma is really good (on rice, in salad or wrap). They recently increased the price, so the value isn't as good as it once was, but still solid. They could give more fries in the combo meal. 

I ordered the falafel and lentil soup. Unfortunately, they ran out of soup when I went. I was looking forward to it so will have to come back for that. The falafal was good, fresh and tasty. 

Its hit or miss with the service. Their service could be a little more efficient, at times it has taken a little longer than I would like to get my meal. 

Tip: make sure you try the spicy sauce. Its flavourful and not overly hot!"}
{"text":"If you have a craving for Mediterranean cuisine, avoid this place. This place is way over priced and you definitely are not getting value for your money here. The 'Shawarma wrap is nothing special, and Osmows Grill and Pita Nutso are much tastier and priced cheaper. The decor of this restaurant is very bland and it feels like you are in a house that was decorated in the late 70's, I won't be back..."}
