{"text":"I love Indian food and having just come from Hong Kong (which has GREAT indian), I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to High Park Spicy House. I got the Matar Paneer Masala with Naan and a Lassi. All were up to my high standards. The lassi was a bit sweet for my taste but, I've had it like that in many different, authentic places. The waiter (owner?) was also very sweet and attentive. You can tell that he really cares about the restaurant and wants it to succeed. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have tried the butter chicken, saag(palak) paneer, buriyani and naan. It was the best I have ever tried in that area. Def should give it a try. Right at the corner of high park and dundas. Only thing is the hours of operation, I've drove by there twice around 5:00pm and both times they were closed. Otherwise, amazing food!"}
{"text":"We walked into the Junction strip looking for Indian. When we got to Curry Twist (which was full) we realized we'd already tried it, so we turned around to try out one of the other Indian restaurants, despite neither of them having any customers (on a Fri night).

THE GOOD: The pappadum starter was absolutely delicious. The server did a good job (prompt, non-intrusive, water refill without asking). And there was no wait.

THE BAD: But after that, the food we actually ordered was sub-par. The palak paneer was ok - nothing special, a bit too sweet. The butter chicken was incredibly strange - like none I've ever tasted, in a bad way. Extremely sweet and a twinge of something I couldn't put my hand on - a little sour maybe? And the texture of the sauce was very liquidy - we were expecting creamier.

The plain naan was also not that great.

I wanted to like this place but given the other choices in the neighborhood (indian and otherwise), we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what \"SP M\" is on about.  

What I do know is that last Friday night, a party of five devoured as much of HPSH's food as we could possibly stuff into our bodies.  Butter chicken was heaven, the eggplant dish was divine, the mango lassi got passed around to everyone, and the pickled sides were of another planet.

The food was so good and reasonably priced, we tipped the waitress $60.   THE best Indian food I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here and it arrives fairly quickly, fresh and hot. The naan is huge and they're able to alter dishes that normally have nuts to be nut free. The beef biriyani is great. I once had a delicious dish with Indian cheese but it appears to be no longer on the menu, which is too bad. Overall, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Got take-out Butter Chicken and Naan for dinner and it was way sub-par. 

The Naan looked like it was store-bought and heated and thick. The butter chicken was too sweet and had a weird taste.

Definitely won't eat again from here."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night and ordered (to go) the Lamb Biryani and the Chicken Tikka Masala. The lamb Biryani was not the same as the Biryani we've tried before elsewhere, but its was very delicious. As for the Chicken Tikka Masala it was average, really. We also ordered Gulab Jamun dessert which was fresh and delicious. Girl behind the counter was nice. The did not give us any cutlery or napkins. No one asked and neither did we. For sure we will be ordering the Lamb Biryani and Gulab Jamun again."}
{"text":"Just a note that we ordered from them for delivery and they were fast, pleasant and the food was hot."}
{"text":"We had four different dishes delivered and none were good.  Even the garlic naan tasted store bought and had the consistency of pizza dough.  The daal was mostly bland, butter chicken very sweet, saffron chicken appetizer was uneventful, and the muttar paneer had a weird texture with peas that clearly came from a freezer bag.  Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not entirely sure where to begin. Afraid that I could go on and on but in short their food was the worst on the Junction-strip (of the four Indian places). 

My order lacked spice/flavor....from the first bite of pakora, the accompanying sauce helped a wee bit to the paalak paneer and most of all the garlic naan. How sad am I? The naan was heavy and I'd bet my life that the garlic came out of a bottle...slightly burnt in flavor. 
The delivery guy was nice enough to bring me the coke I ordered which wasn't included when he initially showed up.  There's something. 

This experience underscored my love for Indian Kiss and North of Bombay..two of the other locals."}
{"text":"The veggie and lamb curries were both so delicious with some garlic naan! Perfectly spiced. It is a nice atmosphere and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"i dont have an issie with the food taste, but my wife, 4 year old duaghter  and i got food poisining there  on friday. my daughter and i are quite ill after two days. butter chicke n was the culprit.  my wife claims she has felt a little off on previous visits, but now it,s clear that they have a serious food safety issue. i reported them to the city."}
{"text":"**As ordered on justeat.ca

We submitted our online order at 8:20 and the expected delivery time was 9:20. The Spicy House delivery guy arrived at 9:15 by which point we were famished.

Overall it was ok for delivery Indian but nothing exceptional by any means. The garlic naan was fresh but a bit doughy, the butter chicken was far too sweet, but the beef and lamb biryanis, served in basmati rice, were very well seasoned. I really enjoyed their mango lassi, and the care they took to deliver it unspilled. 

Portion sizes were on the ample side.We all had leftovers yet an order for three people came down to $60, so very well priced. Plus, most dishes can be personalized to mild, medium or hot.  If it weren't for the long wait and the had-better-naan, this could have been a 4 star experience.

I RECOMMEND: giving HPSH a try if SOLELY to have warm indian food delivered at your door. 

EXTRA TIP: If you're going with the butter chicken, perhaps try it MEDIUM. It will balance the sweetness of its mild counterpart."}
{"text":"Best indian food in high park! The butter chicken is creamy and sweet. The naan is the best ive ever eaten in the city. We usually do take away and its always hot and fresh."}
