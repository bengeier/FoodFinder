{"text":"This was my first time in Hana Sushi, the service was very fast and knowledgable. She answered all my questions and helped me find what I was looking to order. The sushi was some of the best I had in years!!!! Fresh and sooo good. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food I have had in Calgary. Come here for lunch very regularly !!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, their sushi rolls were warm and soggy and the sashimi had wasabi on it instead of on the side. Definitely can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. The place to go if you want to eat traditional japanese food."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great sushi, great service, nice but not intrusive. Small place because it is a family owned business but definitely not a problem. The atmosphere is relaxed and authentic. I've always had a hard time with trying new sushi places but I'm definitely impressed and love the fact that spending money here goes to a family run, local business. If you love sushi and supporting your community, this is the place to be. Owner use to manage sushi restaurant  on the east coast and in Phoenix until opening up his own place! We will definitely be returning to this friendly establishment(:"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 8:45 pm and they closed at 9pm. They were so friendly and happy to have our service! Sushi was on point! So many choices also have noodles and yakisoba! Great specials too!"}
{"text":"Took my 4 year old here for his first sushi, since some reviews said kid-friendly. The staff was great and even brought him some specially rigged chopsticks. I must admit, I was a bit jealous!

For apps, we ordered veggie tempura & edamame. There tempura batter is very light and the veggies were a perfect texture. The edamame was above average.

We ordered a rainbow roll and a philly roll. My son graciously tried both but is not a fan of the stuff just yet.  I however, thought both were delicious!

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the ambiance there. The flourescent lighting is terrible, I reccommend it for lunch more so than a romantic date. The attentive smiling staff made up for that, though so I will likely be back"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant ! Service is wonderful, friendly and helpful for choices and changes such as no cream cheese options and no mangos. I go here often as j am never disappointed. Sushi is great quality in or take out. Best roll is the yammy roll and the Dragons eye. I crave the sushi from here. Couple times a month or week are not uncommon for my visits. Try this place out. No it's not new and hip with fancy decor but I don't mind sitting on a wooden seat to receive great sushi. Other sushi restaurants try to hard at the decor and lack the quality of the food. \"If it's not broken don't fix it\" keep doing what your doing Hanna Sushi."}
{"text":"Hours are Tues-Sun Lunch 11:30am - 2:00pm and Dinner 5:00pm - 9:00pm 


Great food! Almost anytime we eat sushi it's here."}
{"text":"Really good sushi place at Mission, food is always fresh and they have a nice variety in the menu :)
Another good thing about them is that they have a large place so you rarely wait in line: great option for dinner or lunch on 4th Ave."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of sushi and are always looking for new places to try. Unfortunately, I won't be trying this place again. I ordered the Sushi Combo that came with a california roll, dynamite roll, spicey salmon roll, and miso soup. I also ordered 3 pieces of samon sushi. 
At $2.90 a piece I expected the fish on the sushi to be a good size, unfortunately it was very thin and not a very large at all. The miso soup was great, but the rice on the rolls was very warm, along with the fish. The california roll didn't seem to be made of the best quality and very mushy. I won't be ordering from here again :("}
{"text":"I enjoyed a quick lunch at Hana Sushi this week.  Place was packed with all sorts of creative types who work in the surrounding Mission District.
Tried the popular Bento Box and my colleague had an assortment of rolls and sushi.  Everything was great.
Friendly and efficient staff, clean surroundings, great food.
I'll definitely go back when I have a sushi craving."}
{"text":"A good friend took me to this nice neighborhood sushi joint. I was impressed with a friendly staff and delicious dishes. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. It is a very clean and cozy. I tried the lunch sushi special and enjoyed it. The fish was very fresh and tasted good. I had never had sushi before."}
{"text":"I love their sushi! So authentic and the proper size. Their nigiri sushi has the perfect combo of rice and fish. I hate going to some Japanese restaurants where the amount of rice under the fish is too much. The only thing is this place is busy and the service is slow. If you go during peak dinner times don't be surprised if you have to wait for your food! I usually get hangry but as soon as the food arrives and I taste how delicious it is my anger subsides into a smile!"}
{"text":"My sister in law highly recommended this place to my husband and myself. She lived in New York for a few years and she brought some of her New York friends here and they all said it was far better than any sushi they had eaten in New York, so of course hearing that my husband and I had to try it. We got there about 30 minuets before they closed so we felt pretty bad. The sushi was awesome, everyone has their favorite sushi place, this is my new favorite. The scallop pieces were amazing! I highly recommend it. I really wanted to try the apple sake but I am pregnant so as soon as I am able to I am going to try it!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh wow this place was AWFUL!!!! I found hair on the plate and the sushi tasted disgusting!! The rolls were so blase and boring that the waitress could not even identify what they were! My fiance and i could not stomach to finish the rest of our order and left nauseous. Really really bad food!! I love nigiri style sushi and I was excited they had sea urchin on the menu, but even that was disappointing at best. If you are a fan of real sushi and not California roll crap, please don't waste your time here. I have honestly had better fresh sushi at the sushi bar in the grocery store :("}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Great for just a fun outing. Nice prices. Family owned too. Stop in if you just want decent sushi, good prices, and good service. Not five stars, but pretty good. Try it you may very well like it. Chase out!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, had a great meal.  The sushi was fresh and brought out fast even in a lunchtime rush."}
{"text":"Service was decent but not great, they kept on coming by and asking what we ordered.  The place is pretty small so the waiter should remember who ordered what!  The food was decent except my dinner salad came out way earlier than the rest of the meals, even before the apps!"}
{"text":"We live about 1/2 mile from this place and probably should frequent them more often, but we've only been once. We got the lunch special as well as a few extra pieces of sushi. It was all really good and they even gave us a bowl of rice for our little daughter so she would have something fun to munch on. With the lunch special price we fed two people for a little over ten bucks.  Not bad! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hana Sushi is the closest sushi bar and restaurant to our place in the Beltline, and when we first went there we went with the impression of very good reviews (pre Yelp). And our first meal there was quite pleasurable.

Now keep in mind, we here in Cow Town are land locked. The sea is an 11 hour drive away. Salmon and tuna are NOT native. So good sushi, even passable sushi for Vancouver or LA, just isn't available.  I've had to eat some middling raw fish to date. So I was delighted when, upon the first visit to Hana Sushi, I found the salmon buttery, the tuna flavourful, and the Uni savoury. However, I thought the rice was a tad warm, which put the experience a bit off.

The second trip to Hana, the Uni was a bit past prime On the third and fourth visit, the avocado roll came contaminated with flying fish roe (despite sending it back one time, apparently they just scraped what they could see off and returned it to us). Sushi is at least partially about presentation, so this lack of concern with cross contamination with other orders rolled on the same mat was disconcerting.

The waitresses were not always attentive, allowing our glasses to go empty without asking if we wished refills. When you addressed your concerns with them, they were responsive, but never seemed to realize that if you were well \"hydrated\" you might order more.

In short, for a quick meal its perfectly acceptable. For a special meal, or for sushi prepared with care, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Can't beat byob  (excluding hard liquor). Squid and tempura  prawn heads are great. Laid back byob spot"}
{"text":"Great place for some quick sushi. Prices are right and staff is always very friendly. Cute atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sushi. 
And this place is a stones throw away. 

Boyfriend and I went on a whim and were pleasantly surprised that they were able to get us in so quickly and even gave up some tables that had reserved signs on them because the reservations apparently no showed. Oh well, their loss. 

We had miso soup, assorted tempura and the mini boat that had sashimi and California rolls on it. I'm not the biggest fan of rice, so I ate all the sashimi. it was awesome. They also made sure there was no ginger on the plate and brought it as a side because, sadly I'm allergic. 

The bill was also a very reasonable price. The only downfall to the whole experience what the really loud juice monkey sitting next to us boasting about everything that makes him well him... and his poor date didn't seem impressed. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot. It's casual and cozy and the sushi is delicious and priced just right. Have the Katsu!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing sushi!  Freshest and most exotic I have found in Phoenix.  It's a BYOB place which makes it fun to bring your own wine and cocktails!  On top of the food being outstanding it is run by the NICEST family and staff!!  Highly recommended!  I will continue to rant and rave about this place!"}
{"text":"Love love love the sushi here! The salmon tempura, boston #2, and the dynamite (VERY spicy) rolls are delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an appointment that ended around dinner so we decided to find somewhere to eat since we were out anyways. When we walked into Hana, one of the chefs informed us that although we could get a table right away but the food would be a while. We figured \"How bad could the wait be?\" so we got seated and looked over the menu. It wasn't overly busy but we couldn't get the attention of anyone to take our order (if it's gonna take a while, we should at least put in our order right?)

It was probably about 15 minutes before someone finally came by - we both ordered chicken udon. I was borderline hAngry, but I knew I couldn't get mad because they did tell us before we sat down it was gonna be a while. Another 20 mins passed and our soup (finally!) arrived. Imitation crab, veggies and chicken floated in a massive bowl of noodles and broth. I normally don't say this, but it was totally worth the wait. 

I appreciated them being honest about the wait, and the food was delicious so I can't complain. I'll be back again if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sushi here, very fresh and I liked the ma and pa vibe they had going on.  Will be back for more.."}
{"text":"This is a small family run Sushi place.  It is similar to many small place found throughout Japan.  The Sushi is fresh and excellent.  All of the standards are there.   I have also tried the Salmon Toro which was a treat.  The Temprua, Gyozas and noodle dishes are also excellent.  It closes 2-5 and fills quickly at 5.   If you have a group of more than 4 it will be tight!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant! I was the first to be let in for dinner at 5pm. Everyone took great care of us. The salmon sashimi is the best I've ever had. The eel was delicious as well. My dinner date \"doesn't like sushi\" and he had a lovely meal of sesame spinach, potato croquettes, and some of my eel. The spicy tuna hand roll did not disappoint either!  I will definitely be back very soon. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is OK... But the fact that the owner's take 1/2 the waitresses tips, makes me sick. (they tell them that's how we do it in America)"}
{"text":"For all the sushi places in Calgary, this one is one of my favorites. 

It could be because it's only steps from my house (one whole block); but more likely it's because the sushi is dang fresh and reasonably priced. As far as sushi goes, the menu is pretty run-of-the-mill, however, the freshness of the product is what makes this sushi spot stand out.

That said, sushi snobs can find some interesting rolls on this menu; the lllovers roll is a must-try (or is it looovers roll? I can't remember what letter repeats...) but don't expect strange-never-before-seen sushi at Hana.

I am at this sushi place enough to probably own the television in the lobby, and I find the best sushi here is on a Tuesday. 

I discovered this by following a piece of advice from Jamie Oliver who said \"Like you and I, fishermen don't work on the weekends, so don't buy your fish on a Sunday or Monday because it's been sitting out since Friday.\" Albeit, Calgary isn't really the 'who's who' of fresh fish, but I do find a difference in my sushi on a Tuesday or Wednesday...

In any case, all wisdom a la Jamie Oliver aside, Hana is a good sushi place and I 'less than three' it's prices, it's staff and most of all, it's sushi.

T."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Food is good.    The waiter in the pirate shirt is terrible.  Waited too long to order"}
{"text":"For the first time since a pizza eating contest in Bali 8 years ago, I tested the elasticity of my stomach! Conclusion ... I think that it might be made of iron. 

This was my latest experience at Hana. Portion wise, the roll were gracious. At first I thought the prices were a little high for.some things, but the stampeder roll, veggie roll and yam tempura I had were plenty ... and this coming from a gentleman with a large stomach. In addition, I also consumed a couple chu toro, uni and a lot of tea (damn they give you a big pot). I was almost tapping out from sheer sushi madness. There are better places quality wise in the city, but the pieces here are just fine. Will likely order less next time.

I did find it kind of noisy at Hana's there were a few tables that were annoyingly loud and obnoxious. However, one can hardly fault Hana for this. 

A decent place with some generous portions."}
{"text":"I love this small lil mom and pop shop! Our sushi was fresh and delicious, our server adorable and helpful and the ambience was quiet and quaint. Love it! Couldn't ask for more! Plus the sushi chef was very accommodating, super happy to have found this place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very comfortable atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly and always stopped by to make sure we were happy with our food. The quality of the food was amazing and I left happy and full. My husband was very impressed with their miso soup, and said it was the best he's ever had. Their dressing they put on the salad is AMAZING and I have been thinking about it since my last visit. Next time I will need to ask if they sell it. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who love sushi, Japanese food, affordable prices, and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderfully handmade sushi rolls and Tempura Shrimp was delicately crispy. Yum. The service from this Japanese family knows how to show genuine hospitality and attentive service."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time a few days ago. This place is wonderful. You wouldn't expect to find such yummy food in a small, nondescript strip mall! I came in for lunch and though they had a sushi lunch special (3 nigiri, CA roll, and spicy tuna roll for around $8) I wasn't in the mood for rolls. I ordered several reasonably priced nigiri including one of the specials: salmon belly. It was pretty busy but my food was prepared quickly and expertly by the friendly chef, and I assume owner, Tony. I'll definitely be back again soon!

A few notes:
* the fish was all very fresh and of good quality 
* the fish and rice was all warmer than one usually gets at sushi bars - just under room temperature. This is a plus in my opinion. Most places give you fridge-cold fish which, while it makes it obvious it was kept cold to preserve freshness and quickly prepared, it makes it a bit bland. My sushi was prepared in front of me and given to me immediately - not left sitting out and as I stated previously, the fish was very obviously fresh. This serving temperature made the sushi very flavorful. 
* the chef puts a smear of wasabi under the fish on most raw fish nigiri. This is important to note because it seems like very few chefs in Phoenix do this. It's the chef's preference but I feel like many local places go for mass appeal and omit this. Just be aware, most nigiri served here  doesn't need added wasabi, just a touch of soy sauce if you like!
* the chef made the battleship sushi an appropriate size. This may seem very minor, but a lot of sushi chefs make their battleships too large to eat in one bite. The very nature of the things, being filled with roe or, in my case, spicy scallops, make them impossible to bite in half without making a huge mess, so it's important to be able to fit the whole thing in your mouth at once. 
* they're currently advertising gyu-don, a donburi dish of thin-sliced beef and onions served over rice. This is classic Japanese fast food but I haven't seen it served elsewhere in Phoenix. It wasn't on the menu but advertised on small signs at the table so this may be a temporary special (fall 2014)"}
{"text":"Still as good as ever. Good customer service"}
{"text":"OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH-PRICED ! food quality not bad but not that good either. You can just get your sushi at Costco or Fry's and not feel you were    had. Food portions are too small. The serving size of the appetizers are way too small ,not filling enough even for a toddler. We had to eat at McDonald's after."}
{"text":"I've probably been here over 100 times. I am pretty particular when it comes to quality Sushi, and have had Sushi from a lot of places, including the fishmarket in Tokyo.  This place is very underrated and is also run by the nicest family.   Their sushi is simple and excellent, exactly how it should be done. The prices are also extremely reasonable. I highly recommend Hana Sushi, and they also have a great lunch special."}
{"text":"First time here, I wasn't expecting much given my experiences from nearby Japanese restaurants. This place pleasantly surprised me with their food and service. I had the chicken udon and negitoro sushi, both are my go-to's when I have Japanese and both were really really good. The chicken in the udon was yummy! The udon soup base wasn't overly salty /loaded with MSG. The sushi was very fresh and also delish. The interior could do a renovation but the old school feel is relaxing in its own way. Staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely count on Hana the next time I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I go here often with my fiancé and my daughter!! Absolutely amazing food! Thanks Hana!! The volcano roll is the best one yet to me atleast!! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service, great price!

I love the salad that they have you start with. Service is always quick and waitresses always check up on you to make sure everything is good and that you have enough to drink. The sushi is wonderful my personal favorites are the California and Arizona rolls. 
Honestly it's the best family owned and run sushi restaurant in town and I love supporting a great little place like this :)"}
{"text":"A colleague of mine suggested we go to this place for lunch. It was great. I had the chicken soba noodles. The broth was outstanding. We also had some hot tea, which was very flavorful. My buddy had a bento box that looked good too. I may try one of those the next time I go.

The staff are all very friendly as well. Good spot."}
{"text":"Sashimi cuts are decent, but the rolls are boring and fairly bland. Everything has crab salad, and the spicy tuna was mostly rice and not at all spicy. Not impressed :("}
{"text":"Having grown up in Phoenix, but spent my grown up years in San Francisco, I was surprised to find a little sushi place that was so similar to those SF while visiting family. 
 It wasn't THE best sushi, but it was darn good. And the people who worked there were very nice. We had 6 of us, including the 2 kids, and they accommodated us in their small restaurant nicely. It was definitely worth the visit and I would go back when craving maguro or a Phili Roll. 
 The Las Vegas roll was a bit disappointingly bland. I guess the frying drained the flavor. And the green tea ice cream was odd tasting. Almost like vanilla ice cream with a fake green tea flavoring.

But I do recommend Hana."}
{"text":"alright let's be real for a second....if you live in north phoenix, this is the go to spot for sushi.  Granted the ambience isn't the best, but for take out fantastic sushi this is the only spot you need to know about.  I've been to every spot in north phoenix and this place completely trumps J and K sushi over on 7th street and bell.  I have got take out from both places numerous times and let's just put it this way, I won't be going anywhere else than HANA from now on.

All you need to get here is the spicy scallop roll or the rainbow roll and you'll be in sushi heaven."}
{"text":"I love Hana Sushi, I come here a lot for lunch and never had a bad experience or meal. The rolls are fresh, easy on the rice and creative. 

The service is good and you get your food fast.. Reasonable price too.

TIP: get the Goma am. it'll rock your world!"}
{"text":"The best neighborhood sushi spot. The service, food and set up are perfect. Not the plastic sushi you get is Scottsdale, but the family-run small business version that makes America great. When we talk about having sushi, we know we're talking going to Hana."}
{"text":"I've been to Hana Sushi about a half dozen times for lunch over the last two years.  The location is very close to where I work and live; I desperately want this place to be perfect, but sadly, it misses the mark.

First, it's closed on Mondays, which is somewhat annoying, because I always seem to forget about that.  I've been there twice on a Monday and had to go somewhere else as a result.

The second problem is that when you go shortly after they open for lunch, they apparently have just started to prepare their rice for the day.  When you order a 2-piece on rice, we don't expect the rice to be warm!  It should be cold, or at least below room temperature.  The mixture of lukewarm rice and cold sushi in my mouth is not appetizing--and this happened every time I went.

The appetizer salad and creamy dressing was quite good, and the service was good as well.  If they could get over the warm rice thing, this could be a better place."}
{"text":"We have made this a regular stop and every time gone away happy. Sushi is great - we love the california and lava roll and have tried most of the daily sushi specials - all very tasty! I enjoy the saki and yaki soba as well. Goyza was the only thing that missed the mark for us. 

Prices are right and service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Annoying staff, good food but they keep bothering you. I came to relax, left annoyed and  wonderung what was wrong...!? they asked me 5 times if all is ok, but then I realized it was not..or why ask every 5 min. You tell Me?"}
{"text":"Super fresh sushi! Wasn't greeted on arrival and waited a bit for drinks, also was given sushi but no chopsticks, had to get up and ask. But maybe servers were new or overwhelmed. Sushi master was hard at work. Place is clean, does not smell bad, and sushi was super super fresh."}
{"text":"It is a little restaurant serving up great sushi! The staff is great! I love the tootsie and Vegas rolls. Oh the only thing is I am allergic to egg plant and I ordered the fried tempura veggie plate and the waitress couldn't tell me what veggies were being used. They also have some weird hours of operation."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I went there for lunch with my coworkers again because we love Hana so much.  Sigh...but it must be the first time ever that Hanna failed us.  It was a fail because the service was super slow, the food was just alright this time.....what made me really upset was their green tea ice cream which really did not taste like green tea to me at all.  I was so sad.  

It might just be a one time slip and I might have a higher expectation for some of my favorite trusting restaurants, be that as it may, I still do not think waiting for half an hour for sushi (or any food) is reasonable.  

1/30"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a small place...but that is part of its charm. To have a jewel in a small strip mall like that..and so close to home is wonderful. My husband and I enjoy some good sushi and saki bombers on a whim once in awhile and usually this is our choice of where we go. Because it is small, you may run into space issues if you are wanting to try it out at peak times, but eventhen...if you are ok with bar type seating, there should not be an issue. The service is quick and the food is delicious and prompt. Love the small salad they give you right away. The dressing is wonderful..like a ranch dressing with sesame flavoring...so good! I have not tried anything I did not like from the fried calamari to the sea urchin. They have a wonderful variety for everyone. Don't miss out on this hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"We'd just spent 5 hours walking around Comic Expo after work and were starving so we did a little yelping while the parking lot cleared, and decided to try this place (we're somewhat restricted on our diet at the moment but sushi is pretty safe as long as we avoid teriyaki or bbq sauces).  It's a pretty busy place for 9pm but they had a table for us and we relaxed while we debated our orders.  The decor is pretty simple and clean, though they are pretty - a number of lightbulbs need replacing in the dangling creations they have hanging over the tables so hopefully someone fixes that.

 I tried the Yam Tempura Roll, a Negitoro Roll, and the LLoovveerr's Roll.  It was all delicious.  The tuna in the negitoro was fresh, the LLoovveerr's roll was so flavourful I wish I'd ordered a second one, and I enjoyed a lot of their pickled ginger now that I've acquired a taste for it with my sushi.  I can't wait to go back and try new rolls!"}
{"text":"To be completely honest only thing I've ever eaten anything here except edamame and gyoza. I don't eat seafood. However I have bought so much sushi here for my family and I heard how wonderful their food is that I have to write this review. This tiny little hole in the wall sushi restaurant by far has won the hearts of moon valley. You could ask anybody in moon valley where they go for sushi and They always say Hana sushi. This is a \"shop small\" independently owned a local restaurant run by a husband and wife and their daughter.  I honestly have never heard a bad thing about the quality the freshness and service."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars to be exact.  Miso soup was good and seemed to homemade and not from a package. Octopus salad was lightly dressed and cooked well (I always have this expectation of something in the tire family).  Grilled mackerel was nice and charred with firm moist meat, it would have been nice to get the whole thing and not just half....just sayin.  Before going here I read another review and kept it in the back of my mind....and damn....she was right....decent sushi but they have got to not use hot rice.  It came out warm. My mind goes straight to acceleration of bacteria growth. Also got California roll and spicy tuna roll...not bad. For its location and convenient factor....not bad for a strip mall sushi joint with a very good variety on the menu and a clean dining area."}
{"text":"We didn't have a great experience.  When we went the place was full, not completely, but most tables were taken.  We were seated quickly and given menus.  Ordering was really quick, within 5 minutes of getting there our orders were taken.  From there service started to go downhill.  We never got our drinks for about 30 min.  One of our two entree's arrived 10 minutes later.  Once that entree was finished, we asked where the other entree was.  The server said they were busy  so it would take longer than usual to get out.  Truthfully, she forgot to enter the order into the computer so it wasn't even started.  We cancelled the second entree and I left hungry.  The sushi itself was average at best, poor for the cost.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  There are much better sushi places in Calgary including Sakana Grill and Sushi Ichiban.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is the best place in town that I've been to for sushi! Great service me great food!"}
{"text":"Get the dynamite salad!!! Its not what u think. No leafy greens here.  More like a sashimi salad with cucumber and a nice warm heat.  I get it every time."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is our favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix (and several other cities) and we attend regularly. The service is friendly, earnest, and reliable and the chef is the owner. In fact he's the only chef, except for a few holidays when they're simply closed. Except for the occasional disappointment that their closed on Sunday and Monday, it makes for excellent consistency in their already very tasty sushi.

I generally get the sushi hana deluxe because the tuna and salmon sushi (sushi, not the rolls) are so very good. You can tell that the chef really cares about the quality of what he makes as it's very consistently excellent. Furthermore, the sweet egg sushi is consistently excellent. 

They have many specialty rolls that are also very good. We typically order the tootsie roll or rainbow roll, which are luxuriantly rich rolls, as a finished for the meal and are very satisfied.

Also, I frequently walk out at about $30 for two, which is a very reasonable price for such food sushi."}
{"text":"I really like this place because its kid friendly. Nice family restaurant. The staff was very nice as well and sushi was delish...definitely decent for Phoenix. I find a lot of places in Phoenix to be overpriced but I didn't think Hana Sushi was over-priced at all. I thought the pricing was fine. We probably would have spent more and got a lot less for what we paid. We will definitely be returning, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a \"I crave sushi today\" kind of place in the neighborhood and I think I found it. After reading reviews for this place I have decided to try it. I would say for me mostly what counts is food and I thought it was pretty tasty. I have only been here once and it was a take out sushi (salmon and yellowtail). Salmon was very fresh and tasty but yellowtail was just good. I would come back here, but probably as a take out again as the staff (1 waitress and a man prepping the sushi) were a bit on not very warm/friendly side. P.S. They automatically add 10% gratuity to your bill for take out... (???) Ohhkay...."}
{"text":"There's lots of competition in the Japanese sushi scene in Calgary and few places that remain unique and stand out. 

Unfortunately, although this place was busy, the service was relatively quick and the food good, it is not exceptional. 

Cleanliness is always at the top of my list when reviewing new places and this one got knocked down a star because of the condition of the washrooms and general upkeep of the restaurant. I especially did not like seeing the chit papers (from the orders) ON the food before it was going out. Three Sushi Chefs were busy and were all preparing ingredients that seemed fresh and tasted good. The Happiness Roll was the best out of the 3 rolls we ordered. The miso soup was also very good, but small. We did not ask for dessert. 

Dinner for 2 for around $45 including tip."}
{"text":"Hana sushi is a great North Phoenix sushi bar.  The restaurant itself is pretty small and not much to look at but the food is top notch from my experience there.  I ordered the Salmon and Hamachi Toro Nigiri and both were very tasty with quality rish.  The Hamachi sashimi I had provided good portions and was very good also.  My girlfriend got the Hamachi cooked cheek.  I think it was Hamacha hama but I'm not sure.  It was cooked very nice with a savory terikaki sauce.  The food was extremely reasonable considering some of the places I've been around town.  Overall it was a great experience and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I are regulars! By far the best sushi in town-so fresh and the prices are great! The Boston #2 is a must try. I am so thankful for a Sushi restaurant of this quality near by."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new sushi restaurant in our area, and chose Hana based on the reviews. It was disappointing especially considering the great reviews other people posted. We ordered edamame to start, and they brought us a very small bowl with not nearly enough for 4 of us to have a fair share. The rolls were stuffed full of crab mix and had very thin slices of the desired topping. It was me and hubby and 2 kids, and with 2 beers the tab came to $82. I'd be fine with that in a nice restaurant but in a hole in the wall neighborhood restaurant with mediocre food it was definitely over priced."}
{"text":"I typically go to Sushi Kawa, but decided to venture here in stead. 

The service is great (very attentive to detail), price is typical (cheap), and the food quality is on par with anywhere else in the city. 

What I like about this place and why I would go back is I like the interior and the ambiance, it a great crossover of the super casual Kawa but not the upscale Towa.  It has great tables to accommodate larger groups. I enjoyed the ambiance and people watching here more than I have at Kawa. 

I'll definitely be coming back -- soon too!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on what to give this review, as I've been here on a number of occasions and had both meh and good experiences. This time was a good experience. It was my friend's birthday so we decided to get some sushi. Knowing this place I suggested here, as I can't stand Towa. I enjoy eating sushi, not having to think of some scientific way to cut it into 4 pieces with chopsticks and eat it. Anywho...

It wasn't busy which was nice, we were seated right away and got a nice table against the window. Not being too hungry, I ordered miso soup, which was delish, and a bunch of random pieces and rolls. The service was quick, the sushi was fresh and tasted super good. It was the perfect little lunch snack. My friends said it was good as well. If I'm in the area, I will continue to go here for sure, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here though."}
{"text":"The albacore tataki sashimi and volcano roll... mouth waters just thinking of it. The salad you get in the beginning- the homemade dressing in particular- Amazing."}
{"text":"Great family owned business.  Friendly staff.  Great sushi and reasonable prices.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great choice ! I will definitely come back! Great environment and an amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place. I recently went out for dinner there and it was amazing. I ordered the gyoza, the tuna and salmon sashimi and a pot of green tea. The food was fresh and totally delicious! The service and the atmosphere were great and the cost wasn't bad at all. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Hana Sushi has a distinctly Old Spaghetti Factory atmosphere, which is kind of a weird thing for such a trendy part of Calgary (I found  myself scanning around the restaurant from time to time, to remind myself where I was).

While the wait staff genuinely meant well and tried their best, the service felt a little disorganized.  It seemed like we had four different servers, none of whom knew quite what the last had promised to bring.  The long delay between edemame/miso soup and sashimi/main course didn't make a lot of sense.

Anyways, the sashimi was fine.  The rolls were fine.  The price was fine.  There's nothing really awesome about Hana Sushi, but it doesn't suck either."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre. The prices were excellent and so was the service however the food ruined my experience. The restaurant is located in a small plaza..Came here on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend and the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately and our shrimp tempura appetizer came out quickly. I was shocked to see that it only had 3 pieces. I was also not a fan of the tempura batter they used either. My friend and I ended up splitting a lunch special which consist of 2 rolls. Unfortunately the rolls were warm so that made it very hard to finish them. We ended up having a short lunch...but the waitress was great and quick. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Servers were nice enough. Currently glued to the toilet after eating there. NOT WORTH IT GUYS. Go somewhere else to avoid diarrhea"}
{"text":"Wonderful food over what I expected friendly service. Very nice experience. Child friendly. Properly priced, great value. I will become a regular."}
{"text":"Authentic food. I love the ambiance and kind service. I usually order one of the combos since includes miso soup, I love the tiny pieces of tofu :). Besides the large green tea pot. Highly recommended if you want tasty flavors at a good price."}
{"text":"7th ave and Union Hills, next to the McDonalds.  This place is amazing!  Hana Sushi and Vegas rolls are the standouts!  End with a Dynamite X2 roll and a sake bomber and you have a great evening."}
{"text":"It was extremely expensive for what we got. The food was good but not great but the price for one oyster shot was $8.  The price for several specialty rolls were $15-$20each and they were nothing special. I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants and I have never seen prices like that for those kind of rolls.  The pictures on Yelp is what sold me but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"We ordered fried rolls. They were 1/4 fried...Not sure how that happens. My girlfriend is pregnant so we told them to separate the to go boxes into fried and raw. They mixed the boxes up and she accidentally ate raw sushi. Needless to say, won't be going here again."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are always looking around for great sushi places. We found Hana's on Yelp and tried it out for dinner. It's a small, unpretentious resturant run by a family.....very small town flavor, no frills, but clean. The sushi was excellent and the prices were extremely reasonable. This is one of those little neighborhood hole-in-the-wall gems the locals like to keep a secret. Now I know and I will definitely be visiting often....yum!"}
{"text":"I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk."}
{"text":"There is almost nothing bad to say about Hana Sushi. This place is great. Great sushi and it's cheap! I usually get take out  and I love that I can order online! Only bad thing I can say is that it's never ready on time. Add 10 minutes to the time they say it'll be ready at."}
{"text":"So it's in a strip mall type area, but don't let it fool you. This place is delicious. It's small and unassuming, but the sushi I received was great. The chef takes his time to make sure the sushi looks great. (I sat at the bar, so I was able to see him work). I ordered the Las Vegas roll and their new Kanto roll. The Las Vegas roll was perfectly fried. The Kanto roll was also delicious with cucumber, chicken katsu, and cream cheese. The server also brought me a small bowl of salad prior to my sushi and the dressing was super interesting, kind of a sweet ranch or a sweet mayo with soy sauce. My server was great and attentive, even though she was the only server during my lunch visit. All-in-all I'm definitely coming back to this place.

It should be noted the face signs that say: \"please pay with cash for checks under $8\". Presumably to avoid the fees associated with running cards."}
{"text":"Used to live around this area and would always order takeout. It's a convenient, cheaper option for sushi in the area. I wouldn't say that it's the best quality food that you can get but their rolls are tasty and will satisfy any sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! Totally unexpected, I thought it was just going to be your typical non-Japanese owned Japanese restaurant, but it was actually very good. Came with a group of 8 after work on Mothers Day. Made reservations, so greeted, seated, watered right away. Our orders literally took minutes to arrive. I couldn't believe it. The restaurant was maybe about 1/3 full at the time, but 2 sushi boats, apps, and mains all came out within 10-15mins of ordering. Sashimi was fresh, tempura, fried shrimp, takoyaki etc all fried light and crispy. And the place is well priced for Calgary, compared to some other places I've been to. Will definitely return. And the servers were really nice too."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Friendly service. Its also BYOB. How can you beat that?  Priced pretty well too. Weekend can get a little hectic, but the tables turn fairly quickly.  There isnt a great deal of variety in sushi but its good enough.  If you get one of their hot rolls expect it to come out after all your other food is out and your almost done.  Had their chicken as well, a little dry - but whatevs, why are you going to a sushi place for fried chicken?  

I'll go back. BC its close."}
{"text":"Everything was very clean here, that is the first thing I look for when I walk into a sushi restaurant. The service is good and the food comes out quick. The prices are fair and everything seems really fresh. They have other menu options if sushi isn't your thing so don't be afraid to take a friend or family member there if they don't do raw fish :)"}
{"text":"I can dig this place.  There is a bunch of those Asian waving cats decor here.  What's up with that?  And they're all waving at me --- make them stop!  Lunch special was decent.  I generally can't eat a lot of sushi and the lunch special was a little much for me :(  I have the tendency add a little too much wasabi with my soy sauce and boy does it burn.  Service was okay I wouldn't say it was Bam & Pow!  However, I really didn't expect much.  Price was fair compared to many sushi places around town.  Location of Hana is a little odd so I gather they only do well during lunch and take-outs.  In any case, if you live around that area and don't want to travel too far for some sushi Hana is the place to go - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"ok, so this place gets 2 stars for being clean, not giving me food poisoning, and having huge glasses of water. the waitress was pleasant.

and the other 3 stars??? well. let me tell you where they went. i came here to eat with my parents and we ordered a few rolls. when they came out, the waitress had accidentally placed an order for a roll that we had cancelled.... we informed her (expecting, as at most reputable eating establishments, that she would just discount it or comp it). she prompty took the plate back to the kitchen and came out with the rest of our rolls on a different plate. STRIKE ONE! that was sooo cheap and tacky. especially when you consider we had already ate 1-2 pieces of the other rolls before we noticed the mistake! she even lectured us on how to cross off cancelled orders bc she couldn't see it....

next, although not super fishy or old-tasting, the sushi is not the freshest of the fresh. granted, you're not paying big bucks for these rolls, but shoot. it was still overpriced. and lastly, the vast majority of the rolls just use crab salad as a filler. if i WANTED to eat 5 rolls of the same thing, i would have ordered them. 

honestly, if you want good quality sushi for about the same price, go down to JK Bowl on Bell and 7th St. I would not bother going here again. I feel like a jerk for saying that, but, it's the honest truth."}
{"text":"Horrible take out process. Was told 30 minutes. 1 hour later we are still waiting for our take out. Food is no where in site!!!! Plus food is sub par. Ingredients are low quality"}
{"text":"If you blink you might just miss this small, family-owned sushi bar. I myself am not a great fan of Sushi. However, the husband is, and he thinks this is the bomb. We also brought a friend here who lived in Japan for two years, and he said Hana Sushi was the closest he's found to what he had in Japan. 

Fantastic food, and great prices too! For example the lunch special is under $7 and you get:

1 pc tuna sushi
1 pc salmon sushi
1 pc whitefish sushi
1 California roll 
1 spicy tuna roll 
and a small salad

See what I mean? Great value for your buck. Note, though, that the place only seats around 50 people and can get very crowded for lunch and weekend dinners."}
{"text":"Sushi cravings and found this place on yelp. Tucked away in a small plaza center on the northeast corner of union hills and 7th Avenue. Once inside I liked how they had a sushi bar, so of course it was a must to sit in the sushi bar. I was on a mission to sip on some sake  while I eat lunch. The lunch special were indeed \"special\"!  I was amazed by the amount of rolls and sushi  that was included for under 10 bucks.  Overall good experience and a another local place to have some sushi and sake ."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to eat sushi! Their albacore nigiri is a must have. Service is good too."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, and bonus points for having some interesting exotic items.... but the portions are on the small side and prices are on the high side. 

I don't mind paying for great sushi, but hate to feel taken advantage of.

Being an entrepreneur I understand the importance of making your financial obligations, but keeping your customers happy is the key to that. 

I eat out a lot. I wish there were other decent sushi places in Central Phoenix. There really aren't. Still - I am not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Ugh, I think this place has some serious potential for their sushi.  I don't even care about the bright lighting or off decor (or there lack of). 

I read the reviews everyone has left below and I'm not sure I've had the same experience. I think they've seriously cheaped out on a lot of areas and that's why I write a 2 star review...is it the worst I've ever had?...no.

The last time we went in there (and I've been a handful of times because its my brothers favorite sushi spot) we were served warm sushi.  Everything we ordered was (supposed to be) a cold roll but because they used warm rice, it was warm sushi. :/  Plus, they stuff their rolls with crab mix which makes everything taste the same.  The dragon roll tastes just like the spicy scallop roll, weird. 

Also, I'm not sure what they serve as wasabi is a good quality.  It's liquidy and not spicy at all. 

IDK future readers, I think you can find a better quality somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my fiance and her friend. We arrived late - they closed just after we got our orders in - but they were nice enough to accommodate us. The service was passable considering how late it was - normally, I'd like to be checked up on a bit more for drink refills / food quality / etc. but I'm willing to give a mulligan on this one given the late hour. I ordered the spicy scallops, the Arizona roll, and a nigiri variety plate. The spicy scallops were bland and didn't really have any flavor - I have definitely had better, and I was disappointed that they seemed to lack any real spice or heat. The Arizona roll was probably the best of the three, and it was passable enough that I wouldn't mind eating it again (though I wouldn't go out of my way). The nigiri variety plate (I believe it was called the Hana Special or something like that) was not good at all. The fish was room temperature to warm, and there was too much wasabi under it. The crab sticks were especially bad tasting, and as warm as they were I actually gagged on them. I was worried I might throw up, but I managed to gulp them down, only to repeat the experience when my fiance shared some giant clam nigiri with me. I didn't speak up because I didn't want to ruin the dinner, but I wish I had because apparently I wasn't the only one having trouble. My fiance felt sick afterward, and also pointed out what looked like small hairs that weren't at all her hair color on the plate.

I gave two stars because they were willing to put up with us showing up so close to closing time and because the Arizona roll was passable. That said, I have no desire to come back. I have had plenty of better sushi experiences in the valley. While the price wasn't bad either, you get what you pay for. If nothing else, I suggest you avoid the nigiri at all costs, at least in summer anyway..."}
{"text":"I live on the same block so it was in my destiny to give it  a shot. We went there on a late Friday night. We were immediately seated. 

I asked for a sake menu which unfortunately had two options, cold and hot :D We ordered  a bottle of cold sake. The drink was okay but nothing out of ordinary (inexpensive though). 

We ordered miso soup and sea weed salad as appetizer and also an array of rolls + chicken teriyaki as our main dish.  My favorites were salmon and tuna out side rolls. Both of them came with avocado and the ratio of rice to filling was perfect (Around 80% fish, I do not like the rolls that it is 50% rice). Chicken Teriyaki was tasty and sizzling hot. Very generous portion. 

Overall for sure it is not the best sushi town, however, it is very good quality sushi with very reasonable price. Three of us after eating a lot of items on the menu in addition to a bottle of sake paid 70$ (Including tax and tip). Around 23$ per person, which is very cheap for a generous sushi dinner. 

I will defiantly go back there either for take out or dine in and highly recommend it for a reasonable sushi. So next time your are in mission or 17th ave and craving sushi, Hana can be a good option."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots in Calgary. Doesn't hold a dime to Vancouver or Japan, but Hana sushi is better than I expect this far from the ocean. Definitely a step up in atmosphere and value over Globefish."}
{"text":"Although I love the friendly service here I must admit that the food is just alright. I come here for the convenience because it is just a few steps from my office.

 I usually take my order to go. I really wish they would include a disposable sauce cup for my soy sauce.... Wasabi is extremely low quality. The fish itself is good I guess but not \"Damn that's good!\" I once ordered the green tea cheesecake.  Please save yourself some money and don't bother. It was drowning in bottled chocolate sauce and the cake itself very dense and dry. The house salad with sesame dressing might have to be one of my favorite things. Unfortunately that does not come with the to go order and is usually $3-$5 (not too positive) for a SMALL portion. And believe me I always tip well even though I don't dine in. 

  I am very confused on how loved this little restaurant is. Nothing really stands out to me.  You can find much better sushi for a lower price elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi spot. Every single time I go here I am very pleased.
The staff are incredibly friendly, the chef is amazing at what he does, and the double dynamite runs roll is the spiciest sushi I have ever eaten in my life.
I recommend this place to anybody looking for a good sushi spot."}
{"text":"Hana Sushi is simply delicious! Their service is great! They offer a wide variety of menu items. We tried their sushi and tofu. The salad they bring you out in the beginning is a great start. Restaurant has a magnificent atomsphere. Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews of this place, I was hoping for at least a decent experience. 

What I got was frozen fish, terrible sushi construction, and a spicy tuna roll that I almost couldn't eat, but did anyways due to the inflated prices, and some awful service. 

I'll get the easy one out of the way. If you're the server and you see a stack of 4 dirty plates with two people who are still attempting to get some water our of empty glasses, pick it up, fill our drinks. It's simple. 

As for the dishes, we started with the softshell crab roll, which had too much rice and no flavor. We then got the Dynamitex2 roll, which I had expected to be spicy. What we got was spicy tuna, topped with chili sauce. Normally, this would be fine, but instead of prepping their spicy tuna the traditional way (with kewpie & sriracha) it had jalapeño folded into it. The result was flavorless and burning hot. 

Their spicy scallop was offensive, with a small amount of scallops mixed with crab meat and poorly shoved into a roll.

The tako salad was actually tako sashimi, which I won't complain about. The slices were cut perfectly and the sauce was wonderful. Easily the standout of the meal. 

And lastly, Uni(sea urchin). I typically make my judgment on a sushi restaurant based on how they handle such a delicate meal. Typically, a good sushi chef tries to layer the meat in a way that the entire roll can be consumed. This wasn't layered well, and they used a good piece to hide some not good pieces.

I won't be coming back. Almost $40 for 5 items, I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Felt like sushi sashimi on a sunny Calgary Sunday.
Food was well presented ... and good.
Service was below average ... the kids serving don't care on a Sunday ... it shows.
In summary ... don't expect anybody to care that you have chosen Hani."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to home/school so I'll be returning soon. It's small which gives it a cozy feel. Actual seating at the bar so you may be able to watch the chef work their magic. The quality meets or exceeds that of where I frequent and Hana gives them a run for my business. Though not as low in price as my norm (the other has a happy hour) I'll make up in the gas I save. The waitress was very attentive and was pleasant to converse with. Quality of sushi was fantastic, portion sizes were great, no small rolls here. When seated they bring you a small salad, I liked that. Their sushi tastes different to me than most sit downs and while restaurants are obviously hand rolling their sushi Hana tastes truly home made and authentic, guess that's why they've been there 11+ years! Only change I'd like to see would be a sushi happy hour:)"}
{"text":"Another amazing experience!
We have been coming here for years and love the food and the people. 
Awesome local business."}
{"text":"Hana Sushi had been on my radar for a while now, as it was becoming embarrassing how often I visited my go-to spot. I was in lifted spirits when I was fortunate enough to get street parking directly in front of the door, but I imagine had that not been the case parking would have been a bit more challenging. 

The decor is cute and Japanese-rustic. It's a great space, and while not anything hip or special, the ambiance matched the attitude of the restaurant. My only complaint was that the tables for 2 were very small and very tightly spaced - the former being more important while the latter is just preference. The fact the table was small sucked because I like to go to town when I order sushi, so what we ordered barely fit on the table. 

We opted for the Hana Boat, and additionally got the salmon-avocado roll and the negitoro roll, two staples that are my favourite. The first thing that struck me - how fresh the fish was. One of the slogans on their card was something along the lines of \"if it was any fresher it'd be in the sea\" is not too far off. The fish quality was really great. The rice was well done and the fish-rice ratio was great too. 

Price-wise, while this definitely wasn't one of those fancy, \"even basic rolls are gonna run you $10\" place, I still found it to be slightly towards the pricey end to warrant more regular visits. For the two of us, the boat and the two additional rolls ran about 60$, and I wasn't even super full after. The pricing is not at all unreasonable considering the quality though.  Adding on a single Sapporo (at $10!!!) brought it over $70 over the evening. 

I would go back for sure, and stick to the fundamental rolls this time rather than the boat - I'm sure I could get away with $25 a person all in picking from the rolls only."}
{"text":"Went here the other night for dinner with my friend, we shared the rainbow roll, California roll, and something else (can't remember) with okra soup and a small salad. Really good! Wish we had enough room for desert. It's small inside, so not a good place for groups, but great for dinner with a friend or lunch. I'll be back soon, maybe even today....craving some sushi for lunch! ;)"}
{"text":"I recently found this place and it reminded me of my love for sushi. I got so used to the bigger sushi chains that I forgot what good sushi tasted like. This is a cozy cute little restaurant with excellent service ! They are the nicest people there!!  The sushi is amazing and always fresh. I will definitely be back... many times!"}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy tuna roll. There was crab in the spicy tuna roll. I asked the waitress who looked like the owners daughter, \"why there was crab in the spicy tuna roll\"? She said \"they put crab in that roll\". I said to her that's not what it says on your menu attempting to pull a fast one on me. She then states \" you're the first customer to say anything\". I say \"I'm smarter than the average and most people would just deal with it even though it's mostly crab\". I asked her how that was relevant and why she was getting angry with me when it clearly states spicy tuna and cucumber in the roll, \"no crab\". She said she did the menu. I said then put crab on the menu with your spicy tuna like everything else. She then asks if I want another spicy tuna roll and I said that's what I ordered and that's not what I received. I said why are you arguing, I'm making a valid statement, I  want what I ordered and you need to apologize so she finally apologized brought me another. She said she wouldn't charge me, I said I'm going to pay for what I ordered and I did plus still gave a 20% tip. WTF!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi at a reasonable price, with plenty other food options of sushi isn't your thing. Special mention to the chicken teriyaki and tempura vegetables- both definitely worth trying! 
They also do online ordering and delivery if you like to have your fish and eat it too... On the couch that is."}
{"text":"This place has very good sushi. I was very impressed! The black pearl roll and Fuji roll are delicious! They also have amazing bacon wrapped asparagus and very good tuna tataki. The location is also so nice inside! I highly recommend! The only thing I had that was only okay was the Hana roll, though it looked beautiful."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Always yummy, good service and affordable. Avocado salad is simple yet delish!  My favorites at the Hana and Dragon rolls."}
{"text":"Delicious!  
Some of the best sushi and fresh fish in Calgary. Where can you eat sushi for a good price on a patio!?"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices.  -1 star for charging a 10% tip on takeout orders.  I also wish they had a happy hour."}
{"text":"Love Hana Sushi!!! Try the Mars Roll and the Arizona Roll you won't be disappointed  the sitting area is small but intimate. The staff is always friendly. They have non sushi items available as well (calamari, beef bowls, etc)."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars because they changed their menu. They got rid of the beef teriyaki So I asked for them to make me a beef teriyaki platter and they charge me $18 for it when the old one used to be 14 never going to here again. They jacked up the prices."}
{"text":"Been coming here almost weekly for 8 years.  Finally decided to write a review after the ownership created some new rolls for the menu.  I have to say, WOW!

The new Baja roll is amazing!  If you love albacore then this is the roll for you!  The fish is always fresh and delicious and the staff are always happy to do whatever you wish to make your experience pleasant.  Highly recommend this place.

I've even seen Fred Munoz frequent this place a few times. :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Valley.  And for the people that claim the rice/fish is warm?  Its supposed to be served at body/room temperature, educate yourself before you post reviews.  The stuff you buy at Albertson's is what Arizonans consider sushi, where the rice is teeth-cracking cold.  

I recently worked for a Japanese company and have taken people from Japan to Hana.  They said it was the closest thing to real Japanese they have had in the USA.

I've eaten at about 30 sushi restaurants in Phoenix, and most that cost double what the fish costs here, and Hana is still the best.  I started eating sushi over 30 years ago in NYC, and imo this is the best sushi.  The only other place that I liked better was Shinbay in Scottsdale, but they are now gone, and that meal also costs about $150 per person.  You cannot beat Hana.  

The daughters that work here do a great job with service, Mama-san handles the kitchen.  Some kitchen items are hit or miss, but the sushi is always perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place been going here for a few years now. My husband and I usually get take out but the now who we are by our order. They never forget to give me my cheater chop sticks.  The food is wonderful some of my favorite rolls are Las Vegas, New York, Philly, Tootsie to name a few we also enjoy the Kani salad."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went to Cali and my boyfriend insisted in getting sushi I don't like paying for disappointment and sure shit we were disappointed had to go twice when we got back in a row to get the bad taste out if our mouths!  Love their mars roll and the volcano and the Arizona and Vegas!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviewers on here that if you think this sushi joint is the best there is, then you need to get out more. There are TONS of places that are WAY better than this and you will get better sushi for the money. 

First off, the place is TINY! If you don't mind the people next to you sitting in your lap while you eat, then I guess this is the restaurant for you. The decor and atmosphere leave a lot to be desired. It's very plain and the lighting makes you feel like you're in a hardware store. There is no music playing, just what sounds like a radio for the sushi chefs to listen to.

As for the food itself, I ordered the spicy roll combo. Now, when you order something off the menu that says spicy, you expect, well....spicy! Not even a HINT of spice was in these rolls. Bland, bland, bland! Oh, and another weird thing about their menu: there are no prices listed! Very strange!

This was my first, and most likely, last time coming to this establishment. For the price the quality just does not measure up."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years.  I remember when it first opened while I was in high school and I lived in the same area that this restaurant is located in.  My best friend and I made regular dinner trips here and each visit over the years has been incredibly enjoyable.  Over time, I've brought my now husband and work friends here because I love it so much.

My favorite things to get here are the baby squid and the Las Vegas rolls.  When I visit other sushi places, I do look for something similar to the baby squid found here and this is the only place that has it (that I know of).

Nothing has changed since I first started going here as a high schooler and the quality has always been high.  It is a very small place and I do not recommend large groups going there. I have brought large groups before consisting of work friends and it is doable but it should be done right at opening.  Any later there may not be space.  I think this place is best for intimate dates, and definitely small groups like 3 to 4.  There isn't a kids menu or anything really for children so I'm not sure if bringing them for lunch/dinner would be a good idea.

I wish I could visit more often again.  I do not live in the area anymore and this is one of the very few places I will go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Make no mistake. Hana is a must try. The yam fries here set a new standard of heart clogging calories count but it is the best yam fries I have ever had. 

Visited on a Monday for dinner and it was relatively empty. Service is quick and courteous. The good stuff are on the back page of the menu, so look there first. 

I would go back again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited this long to try them out! Their sushi is in my top 3 of sushi I've had in Arizona for sure. Always fresh and tastes great! I always get my food to go - sometimes I can wait 20-30 minutes, but it's definitely worth it. I just wish they had longer hours!"}
{"text":"Service was fast, sushi fresh, love the volcano roll!  Couldn't believe the prices and the menu, very impressed.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The reviews makes this place seem way better than it is. It smelled like sewage in the restaurant, which I tried to ignore because the reviews are so great! But when I got my sushi it was just okay. And one of the rolls I got was completely warm so I didn't want to eat it, but I was still charged for the roll.. I won't go back there"}
{"text":"Great little neghiborhood place, fresh, delicious but have to remind waitress what I ordered? One time Ok but again asked \" would you like anything else\" but still haven't been served what I ordered? If busy just an error but only customer in restaurant and still cheated out of my spicy scallop? Won't go back again!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend on 1/22.  Companion enjoyed a sashimi assortment and I had the chicken bento dinner.  We also split a spicy tuna roll, which was fresh but not very spicy.  Sashimi was apparently excellent, included octopus and egg.  Chicken teriyaki was only ok, the chicken was steamed not grilled and included no vegetables or rice.  The bento box included a very generous portion of solidly prepared california rolls, shrimp (2) and vegetable tempura (a bit under crunchy for my taste but good enough to eat it all) and sunomono salad with krab, very good.  They serve a tiny portion of green salad when you are first seated, with an odd creamy dressing that might be a bit sesame flavored.  Waitress was sweet but not outgoing, and fairly efficient.  Drink prices average, $5 Kirin large.  Decor is cute although a bit like an old Subway shop.  This restaurant was very clean, including the bathrooms, which I like.  All in all, for a neighborhood sushi bar, a good meal and we will return."}
{"text":"We live in Strathmore but when it's time to actually have a good sushi we either pick up and will bring it back or dine in the double happiness role is definitely the way to go"}
{"text":"Got take out from here a few times. Sushi is OK - not super fresh, but tastes good enough. I think it may be a little bit over priced, but I'd recommend checking it out at least once to form your own opinion"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here for years. It is family owned and operated, there's not many independently owned places in the North Valley; they never disappoint."}
{"text":"All of the rolls are \"crab mix\" with a different topping/sauce.  I understand that there are only so many filling they might like to use but it feels really cheap when the crab slaw is the ONLY one. It looks like the sashimi style items have good reviews but I can only speak about what I've tried. I really think they could do better."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  I don't mind a hole in the wall restaurant that needs remodeling as long as the food is good, but this just didn't do it for me. 

I ordered a spicy yellowtail roll and smoked salmon nigiri. The roll was bland and I question the freshness of the fish. The smoked salmon was ok but just did not compare at all to Sakana or Sushiya. 
Not ever coming back."}
{"text":"Another wonderful dinner at Hana. We started with miso soup and the bacon wrapped asparagus which is super yummy but the asparagus was a little tough this time which is odd because asparagus is in its prime right now! Moving on we had the small assorted tempura which is HUGE compared to most places. Finished with very fresh sockeye salmon sashimi and red tuna with a side of California rolls which were fat and lovely....will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a cute little sushi shop. The lovely woman that helped us was so friendly and attentive to every guest there. It was very clean and the sushi was fresh. The price was definitely on par with the food and a little lower than I've paid at other places."}
{"text":"This place is really good and has excellent customer service :) you eat in or take out . It's has a cozy atmosphere its a a great date night spot ."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems on 4 St SW and 17Ave mission area. 

Lunch box is so good with nice varieties. Lunch bento box starts from $9 with a decent amount more than you could finish in one meal. Environment is clean comfortable and sunny, And servers are very friendly and professional!

Dinner sashimi boat is fresh and fresh! They have fresh yellow tail sashimi which only a few sushi restaurants in Calgary offer.

I enjoyed every time of my visit at Hanna!
When you work in downtown and look for a small getaway during lunch time with delicious food at such amazing price, Hana is the place to go and you will never regret!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little sushi gem! Small, cozy, AUTHENTIC! That's how I think I can best describe this great place. I personally order vegetarian sushi, this is one of the only sushi places I know of that adds a touch of cream cheese to the veggi sushis, and I love it. Service is always polite and friendly, the chef is always working hard but has time to thank us for visiting the restaurant. I look forward to continuing to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"For $7.95 you cant beat their lunch special! Very good quality fish at a good price!"}
{"text":"this was the first Japanese restaurant I've tried out in Arizona, and I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I'm from California where the sushi is really good. this place is expensive for sushi quality I would get out of Safeway deli. We were the only ones in the restaurant which should of been warning sign number one. The only really good tasting sashimi was the salmon. 
The location is decorated in a really strange way and definitely needs to be renovated. It's also very small. Overall, go somewhere else. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I liked the authentic Japanese food and the variety on the menu. How many places have curry rice? The taste of everything we had was on point and excellent. We had hiyayakko, oshinko, and a bunch of sushi. They also had a salad with a sesame dressing.

The service was ok. The server did forget one item that we ordered but drinks were refilled promptly and we had no other issues.

The waitress and sushi chef both spoke Japanese and the TV by the sushi chef had NHK (Japanese TV station) on so this place is extremely legit.

Overall, this reminds me of a family owned restaurant in Japan transplanted here in Arizona. I would definitely dine there again."}
{"text":"First time trying Hana Sushi. The establishment has a cool modern Japanese  vibe.  We ordered salmon and toro sashimi-which was fresh and well cut, as well as the Hana Flower and Mango paradise- both very good.  Service was friendly, attentive and fast.  The noise level is a little high, but just gives the place a lively feel.  Parking can be difficult to find because it's on 4th street, but worth the effort to check this place out. Will go again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd liked sushi until I came here. When it was suggested we stop here I cringed a little because I don't like sushi. But I thought I would just suck it up and figured I would find something deep-fried or Soup. But it was really good, presentation was great and everything was very fresh. Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Phoenix all that long, but the fish here is first rate and I eat a lot of sushi

Admittedly, the place isn't much on ambience but every single roll and piece of sashimi was out of site. Try the white tuna and giant clam & asparagus dish. Hell, even the sea urchin which I normally am not a fan of was pretty damn good.

A couple of caveats: I did not pay for the meal or participate in ordering of the food (we ordered omakase) so I'm not sure how much what we were eating cost. I recognize that this fact could make a big difference, but at least on this one night, Hana Sushi achieved baller status."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls here were fantastic! My friend and I each had a rainbow rolls plus one other.  We both agreed that the ingredients were fresh and the sushi was rolled after we ordered it.

Great taste, and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is the only Sushi place I go to.  The Japanese kitchen menu items are real.  The sushi chef is real, you don't see a crew of guys whacking at the fish.  This place is what a restaurant in Japan is like.  Good quality, good service, skip the night club atmosphere."}
{"text":"My SIL and I were craving sushi and so we Yelp'd what was around us.  We chose to go here over JK Sushi (as we've been there before and wanted to try something new).  The location is in a strip mall and can be easily missed.  Inside was quaint and small - but clean.  The service was very nice.  We order 3 sushi rolls, a hand roll, salmon sashimi and I took a pork cutlet with rice home for the husband.  All for under $55.  Not bad at all.  The sushi was decent, the salmon sashimi extremely fresh.  The complimentary salad they gave us at the beginning was small, but good and just enough to get us started.  It was super quiet in the restaurant though - maybe playing a little background music would help ease the silence.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"This place would be Awesome if the hours were more convenient for the customers and not the worker's.  
When they are open the food is Wonderful."}
