{"text":"Yesterday morning I was on my phone checking emails and came across a new restaurant in the area sent to me from Yelp. Normally, I don't spend much time on Yelp emails (no offence, you guys are great but I have more important things to check) but for some reason I continued to look at the email and checked out The Cold Pressery. 

I literally go NUTS knowing there's a new Vegan place around. I'm a picky eater... I don't eat meat and very little dairy. Knowing I can order anything on this menu and not having to worry about cross contamination with meat is reassuring. I've tried some pretty top notch vegan food on a few trips to California (where everyone and their mother is vegan) but this is by far the BEST Canadian vegan restaurant I've been too! 

I went with a friend of mine after our fitness class at school. Was dying for something to eat and showed her the Cold Pressery online. She was quite interested in trying it as well. She looooves meat but I think she loved the Jalepenos tacos even more haha. I got the chipotle tacos. AMAZING! She said she doesn't even miss the meat. Also, I got a Tropical Green smoothie which was delish and my friend got the watermelon mojito juice. So refreshing! 

Obviously we had to get dessert.. Pumpkin pie with coconut whip cream!!!! 

You can tell how much the owners, Jen and Sivon care about their food, how much love and effort they put into everything they do there. 

Thanks guys! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a Hulk's favourite smoothie which was delicious and very filling although a bit pricey at $8. The almond butter was really tasty. Had the chocolate chia seed pudding and it was great as well. The atmosphere seemed really low key and chill. Had some board games and some ipads. The design of the place is nice. The service was good. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews, I decided to try this place out and was really disappointed. I ordered the matcha latte and my friend ordered the rose tea and an espresso. The drinks were too watery, the espresso was terrible and the tea tasted like medicine. The avocado toast and muffin were okay, but nothing here was worth the price. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Fairly decent place in Mississauga. There is nothing like it in the city as of now. However I can't justify paying $5 for a smoothie that I can make at home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places and I have only been here twice.  The chocolate banana muffin was moist, the acai bowl is always delicious but I wish there was more coconut whip cream and the hulk smoothie was fresh tasting not sweet or earthy like not yummy but it still tasted healthy."}
{"text":"tasty, speedy, friendly.  The freshness is place is palpable!  This place has a cool, laissez-faire vibe in what seems to be a corporate pocket of Mississauga.  

I went for smoothies, got distracted by the tacos, and stayed for the WiFi."}
{"text":"very surprised about the chipotle Bean tacos, amazing flavour! the TLT is good too. Great find for vegans"}
{"text":"Nice little coolio spot for some vegan snacks + drinks.

Had the hot matcha latte and a couple sandwiches, both were bomb.

Finished off with the chia bowl, which was also perfect.   

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we were not disappointed. Their menu consists mostly of snacks but they do have a few meal items. 

We got the Jalapeno bean taco as well as the Tofu sandwich. They were both delicious and satisfying. We also each got a smoothie. I got the Berry Chia and my boyfriend got the Choco Maca. Again, they both tasted amazing. They list out all the ingredients they use in the smoothies - no added sugars woohoo!

I have to say, the items we ordered weren't cheap but I think it was worth every penny. The quality of the ingredients they use are very good. The place is clean and the amount of professional equipment and gadgets they have invested into the business is definitely worth supporting. 

Customer service was great as well. We were greeted upon entrance and we were given time to look at the menu without feeling pressured to order right away. The food came rather quickly and the presentation was spectacular. I will post some pictures later.

If you are a vegetarian or vegan, or someone who enjoys eating healthy, this is a great spot. I highly recommend it and will certainly pay them a visit again very soon:)"}
{"text":"We strolled the area and dropped by for a mug of java. 
The interior design of the cafe is exemplary. Everything from the layout and color gamma to the menu and display is very well designed. 
 
The establishment specializes in healthy nutrition and has a good choice of it, though the huge LCD screen flashing only delights of kale and acai seems a bit too much. 
I ordered a coffee latte and a piece of apple pie. The pie was good, nicely served on a cutting board. The latte was ok  and it was served in a paper cup, which is a bit strange for such place. And disposable cutlery in plastic wraps as well. The prices seem to be too much for coffee and dessert with taste no better than any chain coffee shop.

So if you are obsessed with healthy food, the Cold Pressery is a right place. If you are up to a good coffee and pastry, there are many other bakeries in the area with more reasonable prices.

And the address is confusing unless you are a local. Getting there by car may end you up going circles."}
{"text":"Love this place, and appreciate that it is one of the only vegan spots in Mississauga. The tropical green + choco-maca smoothies, various juices, acai bowl (make sure to get the coconut whip!) and jalepeño tacos are all extremely delicious! They are also reasonably priced and well portioned. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the avocado toast. There was only a very thin layer of avocado on white toast (which I found odd for a cafe promoting healthy eating!), and the heat from the roasted tomatoes did not work well with the fresh avo and sprouts. But ultimately, it's not a big deal as everything else was wonderful :) coffee is good too! 

Bottom line, I will continue to support this awesome new business!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Service is usually pretty good, the menu options are creative (especially for a vegan menu) and consistently prepared. It's a good spot to kill some time and hang out - they have a few complimentary iPads and a board game shelf.

The hipster cafe Mississauga needed. Only hang up are the limited hours they're open."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick tomato soup and grilled cheese combo lunch with a matcha latte, both tasted amazing and happy a place like this is in sauga and down the street. Don't read anymore reviews, just go already! 

Bonus, they have board games too :)"}
{"text":"It's a nice chill spot, with great customer service and good food and drink!  A plug under each of the bench seats makes it an ideal place for studying or browsing the internet!   I like the concept and environment they've created here!"}
{"text":"The location is in the business area so I assume it's busier during weekday lunch hours. We went there on a Sunday afternoon and it was empty. The place is setup nicely and the hostess was very friendly. The menu is full vegan, and is not too big which for us is good. I tried the green smoothie which was good ( nothing extra ordinary but typical of what green smoothie should taste like). We also tried the jalapeño tacos and I really liked them. The sauce was fantastic. I was a bit skeptical to try then at first,but I am glad I did. They were delicious! This place is definitely worth checking out.."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch on a Wednesday to catch up with a friend, and it was busy but not too loud. The menu selection is great with pretty decent prices for \"healthier\" food choices.. we both took a good 5 minutes to order haha. I had the Pesto Portobello Toast with a Choco-Maca Shake and my friend got the Avocado Smash Toast with the Tropical Shake. It was all delicious (the Avocado Smash was my favourite) and quite filling! I will be back to try the famous Acai bowl one day.. would definitely recommend coming here for a place to hang out with friends or for a lunch break!"}
{"text":"I had the tomato soup and grilled cheese combo. Heard of this place from coworkers and friends and decided to go. It was a little busy given it was a Saturday afternoon, and seating was limited, but we managed to find a spot. The food didn't take too long to come, and came with a smile. I was a little hesitant at first to try a vegan grilled cheese - but to my surprise it was delicious. The soup came with croutons as well which I enjoyed. 

The Cold Pressery has a great atmosphere and I loved the cute menu as well. Definitely will visit again to try more."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, inviting atmosphere and excellent service! I'll definitely be back. The grilled cheese sandwich and matcha lemonade were delish!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to juice bars and vegan restaurants all around the world and what a nice surprise that one of the best ones I have been to is literally 20 mins away from my home.  I love this place! Best food and ambience for vegans.  Non vegans will like it too ...:)"}
{"text":"I was impressed upon entry into the Cold Pressery, however it's got a long way to go before its shakes can live up to the juice bar standard in downtown Toronto. FYI, this is a sole review based on 3 of their drinks.

Drinks (2/5): I've tried the following shakes/drinks at this place. Choco-Maca Shake, Iced Matcha Latte, and the Bananaberry Chia shake. None of them taste that great, and in all honesty, fall flat on any flavour whatsoever. 

Choco-Maca Shake: Now here's a drink that challenges you to buy it because it's pretty difficult working with raw cocoa and raw maca, and achieve a decent flavour. For those that don't know, maca is a kind of root vegetable that is well known for it's medicinal qualities. However, its not popular because it doesn't taste that great... Combine it with the bitterness of raw cocoa and you can start to understand why it might be a distasteful drink... in which it is. It's unfortunate that the banana, almond butter, and almond milk didn't help in masking the cocoa+maca flavours. It's a textured drink due to the cocoa nibs, and needs an acquired taste to finish the entire drink. 

Iced Matcha Latte: Not much to say on this end. Just get the one at starbucks, it's much too bitter here. Unless you like bitter.

Bananaberry Chia: Tried what I'd classify as a saving grace drink. Nothing too risky in this one. It's comes out a nice purple color, but I think the proportions are all wrong... there were no flavours complementing each other , you barely taste any berry, and although the flavour of bananas is fairly strong.. even that was muted out. More or less tasted like one giant SLIGHTLY flavoured slushy.

Price (2.5/5): I understand that many of their ingredients are much more costly than a non-vegan/organic place, but if the ingredients aren't utilized in a way that capitalizes on the best flavours then it's much too expensive to pay for drinks that don't taste like much.

Service (4/5): They'll treat you with a smile when you walk and take your order in a timely manner. If you choose to sit in they'll bring the drinks to your table, and clean the tables for you afterwards which is a nice touch. Lastly, if they are free they will thank you for your patronage so service is definitely down packed here!

Ambiance (4.5/5): If there was a reason to come back to this place it would be because they simply have a great looking cafe. It's inviting, spacious, clean, and well decorated. They have a beautiful mural of square one on one side and throughout the cafe there are comfy chairs that make you want to sit in. They have a basket of chargers for you to use and ipads to play around with if you sit by the windows. If you've got a big group, there is a small bookcase of board games to play with! Well done on this aspect of the place and is definitely the one reason I would come back. Gotta to still try out their food after all!

The Cold Pressery has got a lot of potential, and alot of aspects in which they strive in, however they've got to up their smoothie game up if they want to impress any Torontonians who make a pit stop is Sauga."}
{"text":"Tried the Bananaberry Chia smoothie and it was amazing. Also purchased some drinks to take home in a very convenient disposable drink caddy. The coconut Chia water is soo refreshing. The vegan snacks were delightful!"}
{"text":"Okay I took my daughter there because she likes it however the portions are so small and expensive for what you get. Let's kick it up a notch make your portions larger. Also the place is boring it's missing the buzz and energy you would expect. 
Create some ambience maybe music or cool videos.
All is good may be a young team. Need to be more creative"}
{"text":"gives vegan food a bad name. My sister had the tomato soup and it was basically just marinara sauce with a couple croutons. I had the apple pie and it tasted like raw dough and the dehydrated food packets the send up with astronauts; the apples didn't taste like real apples and the portion was laughable."}
{"text":"Expensive but so yummy for a healthy Cafe... It's not a struggle to finish the vegan entrees like how I feel at other similar cafes... I was greedy to finish and not share my chia pudding/avocado toast and raw coconut chia juice."}
{"text":"Acai bowl was so good...and there juices are all good!!! They got a fresh cold lemon water for free at the front desk!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. We ordered chipotle bean taco and TLT (tofu sandwich).  If you have a sweet tooth though it is not satisfying enough because their desserts come in very small servings especially the strawberry cheesecake which was pricy for a size of a piece of hors-d'oeuvre but very delicious. I would go back there. We liked the music and the environment too. Music was like Newyork Jazz"}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch-y thing with friends. I was a little worried that the whole vegan thing wouldn't go over well with my decidedly non-vegan friends, but everyone actually loved it.

Starting off with the ambiance, the vibe is very West coast-rustic-urban with lots of wood finishes, simple tables and chairs, and cool chalkboard walls. The food is served on mini wooden cutting board/peels. The people are friendly and super helpful and knowledgable about the food.

I ordered Hulk's Favourite smoothie and the Rawtella toast with strawberry and banana. The smoothie was a little icy, but otherwise perfect - thick, rich, not too sweet, and with a subtle nutty flavour from the almond milk. It was a bit pricey, being $8 for maybe 14 oz. The Rawtella toast was made with continental pasta dura bread, which had a really great earthy flavour that was well balanced by the sweetness of the Rawtella and fruit. The Rawtella, let me tell you, was FANTASTIC - and quite possibly better than the original Nutella. I only wish that they had applied it with a slightly heavier hand =)

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone and everyone, regardless of whether you're vegan or not, health conscious or not, etc. The prices are on the higher side, but I feel you are paying for a quality product. The food is delicious and it will leave you satisfied, without feeling weighed down. I will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The Green Smoothie and Choco Macha tasted great. Price was a little steep for what it was. Great clean open space for board games, chatting, or laptop work/studying. If you need a juice/health fix, check it out. I unforuntaley cannot come here often due to steep prices"}
{"text":"Smoothies and avocado toast is what I normally have here. Delicious menu! All seems to be raw foods and is quite healthy. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Whether you're looking for an alternative to Starbucks, is vegetarian or vegan, or just simply need a different spot to low key hangout with a friend, this place will cater to your needs.

Located off to the side in a not very busy road off Square One Shopping Centre, it can be easy to miss but there's ample parking here.

This spot is supposed to offer \"healthier\" alternatives for hot and cold coffees, teas, smoothies, and light snacks such as sandwiches and tacos. The drinks and snacks are surprisingly more delicious for what one might expect as a non-vegetarian. They even have vegan cheese and gluten free choices if celiac disease or gluten intolerance is a concern.

Small menu, but you can't really go wrong with any of the choices. All the drinks pack a punch of flavour. Some baked vegan goods are also available for purchase.

They have a variety of tacos and sandwiches - all are good but my winning choice would be the classic Grilled Cheese with add-on mushroom for $1 more (though the Vegan Reuben comes a close second if you prefer something saltier). If you do go for a taco, my choice would be the portobello mushroom version. And I would pair this with my dirty matcha drink (made with almond milk as no cow or soy milk available here!).

Keep in mind that the prices reflect the niche it serves (roughly $10 for a drink and sandwich or taco). The snacks are not a large portion, filling enough for 1 or to share as an app for 2, but does not substitute for a full meal.

Come here if:
- Need free WiFi with a brightly lit space to talk or work
- Crave something else other than your generic coffee or smoothie
- You or your guest(s) is/are vegetarian or vegan
- You can afford to splurge on buying a premium drink and snack"}
{"text":"I went to check this place out as I saw a lot of yelpers flocking this place and giving their thumbs up. So I made my way to have their Hulk's Favourite Smoothie drink, which had almonds, kale, spinach, almond butter, banana and hemp seeds. This here my friends is a MEAL! rich, smooth and heavy drink.

I also tried their organic version of apple piece which was alright and over priced. 

The design of the cafe is more futuristic with ipads and connections for electronic and a free wifi connection."}
{"text":"I have since lost my pictures from when I came here, but it was when the place was relatively new. My vegetarian friend was very excited to check it out! We visited this place, attracted by its vegan minimalist and hipster concept. I had heard great things about this place, and was also very excited to try it. 

I've heard amazing things about their smoothies and bowls, but was feeling more savoury fare that day. In the end, I ordered their portobello pesto toast, and although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I did find it to be overly salty. Moreover, the price was insane! For $5.65, I was getting ready measly piece of toast. As such, a word of forewarning - this place is NOT cheap. Don't expect the portions to be large by any means. 

Last but not least, I found the use of plastic utensils very ironic and not aligned with their concept of being earth friendly at all. The Cold Pressery is greatly overpriced, though I can definitely see it as a first date place!"}
{"text":"Picture came out great but the taste wasn't anything extraordinary. I found it to be overpriced with such small portions. I get that they're serving a niche group of customers, and it definitely doesn't include me. Other people might find it to be great but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes AKA it's a must try!! 

Who knew vegan food could taste so good? Cold Pressery did and they are doing a damn (can I say that?) good job at it! 

Their grilled cheese is delicious and a must try. It's $4 and you can add toppings at an extra charge. The doughnuts are yummy and the smoothies are filling. 

The smoothies are quite expensive so I would skip out because similar smoothies are available at other joints like Booster juice, Jugo Juice, etc for a lower price. As for the food and desserts, definitely check it out to indulge without the guilt! The service is fast and friendly which is always a plus. 

The interior is cute too. They have a chalk drawing of the 905 scene on their back wall!"}
{"text":"Service: the staff was very friendly and super helpful food and drinks came out promptly

Smashed avocado toast: this was delicious the tomatoes on top were a great added taste to the toast and I love how they have chia seed bread.

Coffee: ok so this is what was truly disappointing, please educate or find the proper education for your baristas on how to make a proper americano/espresso. The water was way too hot and my Americano was incredibly watery and that's with a double shot. There was no burnt taste so that's a good start but unfortunately I would not order coffee here is you are into the coffee culture."}
{"text":"The new kid in Yelp GTA town, The Cold Pressery, the only word in freshly made organic juices and smoothies in the 905. This isn't no Booster Juice with a 500 calorie power smoothie to completely negate your recent work out - heck no! The Cold Pressery is about eating trendy/healthy/clean foods in an even trendier location. 

But trendy Queen West style Vegan cafe and Juice bar in Mississauga? Yes, and with spots like this and The Wilcox and the soon to open Door Fifty Five in Port Credit, the city is rapidly attracting the \"cool\" businesses you see in larger cities, but spread throughout this suburb.

That said, The Cold Pressery is battling a bit of a suburban sad story, being that they're apart of a larger plaza with the numbered address applying to an upper lot mid-rise tower, while the lower lot is where you'll find this business (enter 7 Rathburn, on your GPS and you'll find you arrive at their front door much quicker). 

There are iPads at the front connected to the WiFi simply for customers to use, awesome! What a great offering while you wait for your healthy noms to go! And NOMS they are... as in NOMygodthisstuffontheirmenuisgood!!!

Who would have thought eating healthy could be so delicious. today I went with the Chipotle Bean Tacos and the mean, green... Hulk's favourite smoothie. Was I missing meat... nope, these tacos were incredibly flavourful and freshly made, while the smoothie was filling but made with delicious fresh ingredients, that alone would taste kind of \"meh\" but the way The Cold Pressery mix them together, it's amazing!

Now folks in Mississauga no longer have an excuse for going to Freshly Squeezed in the mall or Booster Juice when they're attempting to eat/juice healthy, you've got something delicious close to home - no more treks to Toronto for healthy eating!

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I never had an interest to come to The Cold Pressery because I'm not a vegan. So I figured I wouldn't love the food. My friends wanted to go and kept saying how good this place was. I went with them and ordered the Avocado Smash Toast and it was great!! For around $10 you can get a drink and something to eat. This place is affordable and has a great environment to work or chat with friends.

The store itself has an app that you can earn points through, but in my opinion is not worth it to get. You have to pay for credits essentially onto the app in order to order/pay/earn points through it. I did it, but the lowest amount you can pay is $10. So now I'm almost forced to go back since I didn't use the full $10. Luckily I enjoy this place, but I'm not sure how often I will come."}
{"text":"Really really like this place! I love the Iced Vattes and Tacos (although not the most filling food but it still taste great :D). The atmosphere is great and I love the interior! As a student this place is nice and quiet when it's not busy making it a perfect place to study! Their wifi isnt slow at all and I just really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! I have a life-threatening allergy to eggs and went here to try a dessert, which I usually cannot from elsewhere, as majority of them contain egg or egg products. I informed them about my allergies, even though I knew that the place was purely vegan. I made sure to let them know that even if there is a slight chance of cross-contamination, I will have an anaphylactic attack. I ordered a pumpkin pie slice to go, ate a bite, started to feel my throat closing up and was rushed to the hospital. 
I called them the next day and asked to speak to the manager. They denied me the chance, saying that he/she was too busy. When I told the girl who picked up the phone about the issue, instead of apologizing for the mistake, she was extremely rude and said that it wasn't their fault because the pies are made elsewhere. So overall,
1) If you are going there because you follow a vegan diet, you are probably not getting food without animal products mixed in. The fact that one bite of the pie caused a severe reaction indicates that there were eggs mixed into the pie and it was not a case of mere cross-contamination.
2) Their products are not made on-site. They are marking-up the prices of goods they buy from elsewhere and fooling consumers into buying them.
3) The staff do not take allergies seriously. Neither the server that sold the pie to me, nor the server I complained to about my situation cared enough to take the matter of a life-threatening condition seriously."}
{"text":"How does that Public Enemy song go? \"Believe the hype\"? I could have my lyrics mixed up, but in this case you should believe the hype about this place.

As others have said, it's about the most 'city' thing you're going to find west of the 427. But that's not what matters most - it's about the quality. The Cold Pressery's smoothies are, in reality, what is only fantasy for your other common 'juicer' places, namely: fresh fruit, only natural sugars, healthy, etc...

It is also a coffee place, so I thought I'd try to have the best of both worlds with the '5 to 10' smoothie. It's made with their cold pressed coffee, but also includes banana, almond milk (so non-dairy), hemp seeds and dates. I love it when seemingly unlikely ingredients come together in complete harmony. Great depth of flavor with the coffee. At first I was surprised from the little chunks of dates, but I think it was the intent. They almost act like the tapioca in bubble tea for texture (though smaller and different taste of course). I did sample of couple of my friends' offerings which were very good - and without chunks if you wish to avoid that.

I will say as a heads up, that most are likely accustomed to a bigger hit of sweetness when first sipping a smoothie from virtually any other place. Here, with it being natural, it is more subtle. The taste does quickly grow on you however, and the 'naturalness' and genuine quality are evident throughout. The best way to describe the smoothies in a word is: refreshing. A bit cliched, but they're not just refreshing in the basic sense of something cold hitting your mouth (like soft drinks and macro beers boast of) - but refreshing in the fullest sense of truly awakening your palette with a variety of tastes.

As is the unfortunately reality, it does cost more to eat right - so you're looking at a higher bill than you may expect. However, that doesn't effect the rating as the store is also likely shouldering a lot of that cost as well.

Great decor, comfortable place, and very friendly staff.

It will be very hard to ignore this place whenever in the area. I also can't wait to try the regular cold pressed coffee and the food."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Beautiful place, fresh food. Their chia pudding bowls are divine. Well priced.  Might recommend putting a salad or noodle bowl on the menu (for those with a grain-free diet). Other than that, loved this place and will return."}
{"text":"This place is Heaven. So fresh and so Healthy. My favorite is the acai bowl and the bannaberry smoothie. Putting premium fuel into my body makes me feel amazing. Owners and staff are extremley friendly its like we are friends now !!lol. I repeat everything on the menu is delicious"}
{"text":"The smoothies are incredible but not worth $9 (after tax) for the size equivalent of a Starbucks grande in my opinion. You realize after reading the list of ingredients that you would be much better off buying a pre-made smoothie at your local grocery store - or even buying the same fruits and veggies to make your own smoothie at home. Their acai bowls are definitely worth the hype though! Would highly recommend trying it out if you are looking for the best item on the menu. 

The ambience is very laid back and hip with soft wood paneling and soft overhead lighting. The cafe is always buzzing with conversation from small groups of friends and families. 

But the main reason I knocked off two whole stars is the poor service that I've encountered on the multiple occasions that I've visited this establishment. With 2-3 baristas behind the bar and no patrons in line, I've had to wait at least 5 minutes before someone bothers to ask me if I want to order. When I asked for a potential discount affiliated with my local yoga studio, the barista flat out ignored my request and rang up my total for the full amount. I'm not upset about paying the extra dollar but the service attitude was just insulting. I'll have to rethink whether or not I want to keep going back to this type of cafe in the future."}
{"text":"So far whatever I have tried from cold pressery has not disappointed. Located in the heart of Mississauga, CP tries it's hand at vegan gluten free goodies and does not fail to deliver.

I really enjoyed the jalapeño tacos and grilled cheese with tomato soup. Both were extremely flavourful and had an ample amount of kick to them. I've only tried two smoothies - the chocolate maca was amazing and refreshing.  My only qualm is with their portion size for the desserts. I ordered the tiramisu and for $6 it was a small tiny tart sized pastry. It was delicious but you don't get that satisfaction after finishing it in 2 bites. Portion sizes for desserts is something they need to improve on indefinitely. 

Other than that location, ambiance, and food taste are excellent."}
{"text":"This place has a very cool vibe. Good place to grab a smoothie and light vegan meal or snack with a friend. I would come here for lunch on work breaks for sure. Happy healthy vegan place. Not much selection but a good snack place. Mmm be healthy happy and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. This little unassuming café with a vegan stamp of approval is located off the beaten path. My bf and I came there for dinner one rainy evening. I had only agreed to go here after he promised me a treat afterwards to hush my carnivorous cravings...I've never been much of a vegan fan, but there were many selling points this place had. The service was low key, you order then pay. Food is then delivered, pretty run of the mill stuff. Servers were friendly and welcoming. Food delivered fast.

The décor was very organic chic (is that a thing?), everything felt fresh, open and just all around simple. Lovely menu wall complete with hand drawn pictures and description for ease of navigation. They even had a low-key presentation playing at the back of the room to educate diners of their products and its advantages. Price wise it is what you would expect from a vegan place. It is pricey but it's worth a try.

We ordered the Ruben sandwich, grill cheese with portabello mushrooms, a chipotle taco, and an acai bowl. Food came quite timely. Best first: to put non-vegan grill cheese to shame, this vegan grill cheese was superb-it was ridiculously delicious. The crispy exterior was just that, CRISPY. The cheese had a lovely taste and texture. Not drowning in its own greasy, my palate and waistline felt pleased. They loaded the cheese up! The cheese itself was gooey good and have a nice springiness to it. The mushroom added even more umami and texture. Hands down, definitely a reason I would come back.

The Ruben was not my favorite, it was strictly based on preference. The components of the sandwich was great. They used a white mild melted cheese rather than the slightly stronger yellow-cheddar colored one in the grilled cheese. The white cheese was a little too mild as it blended in unnoticed unless you made it a point to look. The meat was nice worked well in its application. We found the sauerkraut too overwhelming. The sour taste was too predominant and left the rest of the components in its shadow.

The taco was a bit underwhelming too. The beans and chick peas were the main staple. Nothing particularly untasty. We just found it boring and plain. It's been done and simple. The purple cabbage provide nice contract and vibrancy.

Lastly, the acai bowl was interesting. The myriad ingredient were pleasantly welded together. The freshness of the fruits, creaminess of the coconut whipping cream (the star, may I add) the nice crunch of the granola. The cold, slightly icy puree of the acai fruit, we had a slight hint of cocoa too. It was a nice palate cleanser and end to the meal.

Overall, it was a nice experience and change of pace. I never did end up getting that little treat at the end on account that I had to roll myself out the door. The meal was surprisingly filling. It is pricey but it's a nice healthy splurge. I forgot to mention there were board games on the shelf ready to be used. They also provide a nice working space and free Wi-Fi. Check it out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"The aciai bowl was delicious and I keep coming back for more. Not impressed with the smoothie (tried the chocolate one). If I wasn't so against vegan food, I might try the avocado smashed toast that's getting all the rave reviews. Plaza location is hard to find initially and the Indian restaurant nearby emit a very strong aroma throughout the entire strip."}
{"text":"Felt the need to write a review as I am sitting at the cafe - It's that good. Came here with some friends to study, and was honestly surprised to how nice this lowkey cafe is. Great ambience, awesome service, great choice of music, wifi that actually works properly, and such a nice place to just chill. Everything is vegan, which is alright, but the fact that it actually tastes so good is even better. Will definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Got a cold press juice and it was $10?!!! Could've gone to Whole Foods but my place is closer to here."}
{"text":"Finally a good vegan place in Sauga! This place is a nice relaxing place to grab a bite.  It's clean and the food is good!!  I didn't like that they use plastic cutlery and take out containers for their food.  Being a vegan place they should try to create less waste.  I don't like eating my hot soups with a plastic spoon!

I got the soup and grilled cheese combo.  I usually hate Daiya cheese but this one was amazing, I couldn't even tell it was Daiya!  Nicely done Cold Pressery!"}
{"text":"Alright, truth time. I gave in to the trend and tried this place a couple of times.  

a) Had a cold pressed juice.  
b) Had Hulk's Favourite Smoothie which had almonds, kale, spinach and a bunch of other superfoods.

In terms of the cold pressed juice, I wasn't a huge fan.  It tasted like juice and nothing out of the ordinary and for like $6 to $8, I was expecting to be a blown away. 

In terms of the smoothie though, this was da bomb! It had a great nutty taste to it and a good thickness so you could tell it wasn't watered down either.  This was only $8. 

Verdict: Go for the smoothies, but not necessarily the juice."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with a friend. 

Honestly my rating is mostly based off of pricing. Don't get me wrong the juice I had was good but $10 made both my friend and I both shocked when it came to ringing up the bill. 

I got the melon mojito and my friend got the   Green glory? (The one with apples in it). The green juice had a very strong celery taste to it. I think we both enjoyed our juices but still $10 is pretty pricy for it. 

My friend also ordered a grilled cheese and said it was good. 

Overall good drinks, just a bit on the higher side of pricing in my opinion."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, needs professional approach to running a business.

Ok, I admit I am a sucker for a great looking place but I need the food to be just as good. Cold Pressery is among the best looking places in Mississauga - if you need proof, you can check them out on this internationally renown retail design blog http://retaildesignblog.net/2015/05/17/the-cold-pressery-by-1point0-mississauga-canada/

All the said, the looks is in huge discrepancy with their consistency and messaging. The juices are sometimes stale and many food items are not available. They claim to be environmentally friendly, yet everything is served in disposable cups! How about starting to save the environment by pouring water in a glass cup and coffee in a mug???? I hate places with messaging that are this inconsistent! Don't just fall for the hipster promo, act upon it too. 

Staff needs to get a bit faster at serving patrons and prevent kids from feeding the Kitty Kat tip box that has a very annoying sound. Besides that Cold Pressery is a great addition to Mississauga's culinary scene that needs some more work."}
{"text":"Great drinks! I had the Hulk and it tasted just perfect."}
{"text":"This is a unique treat, an oasis among many hum drum run of the mill establishments that copy each other.  I found the menu creative, healthy, and simplistically brilliant (not copiously strewn with random dishes just for the sake of filling up the menu board).  I had the tropical green smoothie and a vegetarian grill cheese.  They were both scrumptious and fairly guilt-free.   

I decor was tasteful and not overly done, and there were two ipad stations available for customer use.  Price was similar to Starbucks but with far healthier options, including a decent variety of meal offering.    

I would not hesitate to visit this establishment anytime in the future.   Not a cheappy place, but great overall healthy offering for a fair price.  Kudos to the owner, who resisted opening another franchise joint that serves the same old stuff, and created a healthy, original, and simplistically brilliant place I can hang out.

{"text":"The food is great. But if you're looking to grab lunch during your work hour, think twice. I placed my order at 12:20 and still have not received it. It's 12:57. Orders being placed after me were served and eaten before I got mine. If this was a cheap-eat I wouldn't have cared. I shouldn't be paying close to $20 for lunch and receiving terrible service."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.. I feel so bad giving this rating on their page, even though it's not a bad one. 3 stars = \"a-ok\" and this is exactly what this place is. Let me tell you.. venturing to Mississauga by myself and searching for this place was DEATH. With no passenger to guide my iphone GPS and nobody to scream last minute to turn at random streets, my car must've looked like a lunatic was driving it as I was turning unexpected corners at probably 60km/hr. I was near the haze lounge and was soo confused when the map told me it was literally RIGHT there. Huh??? Turns out it's the plaza right next to it, and cold pressery faces rathburn rd.

Upon entering, I was delighted to see the chalk drawing of Mississauga. The owner's got some talent! Everything was very cutely laid out and extremely visually pleasing. I found the prices to be quite high, but then again vegan food is not cheap because it's so rare. After starting my vegan journey, I've been making many similar dishes and smoothies (oh my goodness, you guys NEED to taste my acai bowl breakfasts...) & even using organic and whole ingredients, I can make several for the price of one here. I understand that they buy locally and only use organic ingredients (which is freaking awesome!) and that's how the prices are adjusted accordingly. 

I spent $25 on just myself and I ordered the tropical green smoothie (very natural ingredients with a fresh, high quality taste. No extra unnecessary sugar, which I love), a jalapeno taco dish (very yummy. I live for tacos. $9.25 for 3 is actually a pretty good deal for this - keep in mind, this ain't no low quality taco bell shit. This is high quality vegan tacos packed with flavour that we're talking about) and a tomato basil soup (small portion and it wasn't completely piping hot, which is how I prefer my soups. It was okay though) 

Overall, this is an extremely adorable place and I wish there were places similar in the east end. Seriously, Markham/R-Hill.. step up yo game! It's time to serve the vegans of the community.

Oh! And service was extremely friendly. Your staff are all amazing people who are so smiley all the time. I love it! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in sauga and try the shots ($2.50 for one, $6 for 3) and the pressed juice (D'oh! I forgot to grab one to go)"}
{"text":"Picked this place as the location for a few one on one meetings we were having for the Young Leaders Council.

I wanted to meet here instead of Starbucks to support the local businesses, plus to be honest their food and drinks are all better than Starbucks...

Had their tomato soup and grilled cheese with spinach. Delicious! Light and fresh with vegan cheddar. It was a perfect meal combined with their lemon water. It was so good, the next day I went back and ordered the same thing. Pricing was good for it as well.

I also tried the butternut squash which was mouth watering good. My friend tried the Green Hulk and said it was tastier than other \"juice\" places. 

They have pies from Kensington Market so a huge plus! I had their pumpkin pie and it was delicious, not too sweet and crust was crunchy.  

They have a few other food options I'm excited to go back and try,

The decor and ambiance inside is nice and creative, and they have games for customers to play as well. Hello Battleship!

We look forward to many more dates with this local gem!"}
{"text":"Aye yo hipster boyz in town i'm here to write a review of probably the MOST hipster lookin cafe in mississauga. i mean, for sauga we're pretty mainstream and we don't have much in this city. this place surprised me doe. i dropped by here and all of a sudden i feel like im at a coffee shop downtown, queen st W and im chillinnnnnnnnnnnn

N E ways i think the atmosphere created by this place is very chill, hipster, swag and stuff. just feels like a great coffee shop to get some work done or to just catch up witha  friend OR TO GO ON A DATE WITH YOUR GF /BF i dont have one lmao i was here by myself sad times

so i walked in here and as for the drinks i had no idea what to get so i looked to the asian dude at the counter and he was like OH ASIAN CONNECTION so i asked him 'u kno i never been b4 wuz goooood here idk what to get' and hes like 'yo try out the macho green tea latte its pretty good' and im like 'blessed' and he made it for me.

although it was $4.5, the drink was pretty bomb considering how much i love green tea and stuff. he even made a little snowman with the cream and it was pretty dope lol

i guess the only downside with this place is that most things on the menu are pretty pricy (smoothies are $8, dunno if they're worth?) so if you're grabbing lunch here expect the final to be roughly $15-20 for like a sandwich and a drink. which isn't that bad honestly, but there's MANY other good places to spend that $20 for food. 

in conclusion, this place has great atmosphere and service, drink isn't that bad (haven't tried food yet), otherwise if you want something cheap DONT COME HERE. but still love this place doe

also, for the TECHIES if you want the wifi its router only supports 5ghz, so if your phone/laptop can only connect 2.4ghz, then you can't get the free wifi."}
{"text":"Not quite deserving of a 4 but I prefer to round up :)

There's been a buzz about this place on Instagram and Yelp, so I was excited to try it out despite not being vegan.

TCP has a very trend vibe and I especially loved the way they've designed the menu board. There's only a few tables + 2 sofa chairs + few bar stools. We were eventually able to move from the stools to the sofa chairs - they'd definitely be comfortable if you're here for a drink, but not ideal for eating a meal.

I ordered the Jalapeño bean tacos ($9.75), Choco-Maca shake ($7.75), and Protein Balls ($1.35/each). 

Tacos: contain beans, veggies, and guacamole. They were pretty tasty but lacked the heat I expected - would have been better if spicier. 

Choco-maca shake: This contains raw cacao, raw maca, almond butter, almond milk, and banana. As a REGULAR chocolate lover, I wasn't sure if I would like this, but I did - basically a chocolate-banana shake with a nutty/gritty taste.

Organic protein balls: ordered 1 coconut, 1 hazelnut, 1 chocolate. Based on the appearance, these seemed to be fudge balls and good for dessert... nope! Not sure what they really were but definitely must require an acquired taste because they tasted awful. 

Overall didn't quite live up to the hype but definitely a good place for healthier options - central Mississauga location makes it convenient too."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome vibes. My daughter had tomato soup combo and I had the same as well as portables taco. Tacos where very delicious. Just getting use to vegan food and I am starting to like it more and more :) one suggestion would be using less plastic and if people eat in offer glass cups for the awesome juice!"}
{"text":"Downtown feel right in Mississauga! Hipster place with a little overpriced coffees, \"healthy\" stuff and cool decor"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by attending a function that allowed me to taste different items on their menu. I doubt there is any better way to get a sense of how good a venue's menu is then by trying bits of different things they offer. 
I was so impressed by every item, I tried multiple different juices, the two different tacos, chia seed pudding and a quinoa based caramel chocolate cake (which fingers crossed, will be a regular menu item soon). I assume most people will come here for juices so it is good to note that they have a regular rotation of cold pressed juices (its not that you come in a create your own). They can def let you know which ones are sweeter and which are a little more 'green tasting', it all depends on what you like. 
The chocolate chia pudding was really nice and really quite filling, chia pudding is not usually my thing *gasp* shocking I know,  so I was impressed with how much I enjoyed it. I am going to have to talk up this cake even though I am not sure if it has made it to the menu yet. But if you see a quinoa, chocolate caramel cake, you must stop everything and eat it immediately. I am not kidding, possibly the best chocolate cake I have ever had. 
I plan on bringing other people back here for the tacos, because they were so good! I loved the jalapeno one, such a nice flavor."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and I love it every time. They have really good drinks and grilled cheese. I am mostly vegan and I like all the food here. I'm a major (non vegan) tiramisu fan, and the tiramisu here is really good, same textures and everything as a non vegan tiramisu.. just a little bit coconutty, and the portion is smaller than standard. The location is a bit hard to find your first time but at a good intersection, you jut have to drive down the ramp to get there (not at the bdc building). The service is friendly and food comes out pretty quickly. They have some baked goodies like muffins which are also yummy. The atmosphere is small but very nice, they also have board games at the back if you're there with friends. During a rush time the place does fill up quickly though. Free lemon water is available. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite to eat with my mom around 2 today and was really digging their interior design. The wood paneling counter and chalkboard paint on the walls gave it a really awesome vibe.

We got a bottle of cold brew as well as the TLT. Both had amazing flavor and the sandwich was fresh and had a great kick. Only wish we got a little more bang for our buck. 

Can't wait to try several more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was searching up new places in Mississauga and found this on Yelp.  It is a 10 minute walk from work and now that the weather is warm...this is the perfect place for a healthy snack. 
I recently just tried cold pressed juice and am absolutely in love with them!  I'm so glad there is one my area. When I visited on a Thursday afternoon,  it wasn't busy and I was greeted by the staff instantly.  They were super friendly and gave me recommendations.  They mentioned that they had ipads as well for browsing which is awesome.. Looks like I found a neat place to chill. 

I wanted to try their fresh cashew milk but they were just in the process of making both the almond and cashew milk.  Apparently they sweeten the milk with dates and they add cinnamon as well- quite an interesting combination.  I will definitely be back to try next time. I ended up getting the hulks favourite smoothie and it consisted of kale,  banana, spinach,  almond milk and almond butter (from what I recall lol).  It was soooo good and I felt soo healthy.. Thumbs up!  The staff told me it is their most popular and now I know why- try it if you're looking for something different and not fruity. 

They also have Chia seed pudding in 2 flavours,  various pastry options (gluten free and vegan).  They also recommended the cold brewed coffee and the smashed avocado toast. They also have high quality matcha which I'm sure my fiancée will want to try. 
Unfortunately they didn't have too many pastry options so I wasn't able to try any,  but apparently their pie is awesome. 

I'll be back next time and hopefully they will have all the items available. They only opened for a week at this point when I visited so I completely understand that there are still things in the work. 

Until next time :)"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out today after driving past a few times and seeing the sign. 

This place is awesome! They didn't have the cold pressed up and running yet but I got to sample some of the juices and items they will be selling shortly and man were they awesome! 

The cashew milk! Sooooo refreshing and not overly sweetened! 

The Chia pudding! Great!!! Vanilla and chocolate flavours. 

Now my favourite! The Acai Bowl! With bananas and blueberry a with granola and hemp hearts! Was just what I needed after my workout. 

They will soon be serving nitrogen coffee, wheatgrass shots, cold brewed coffee and lots of smoothies and juices. This place, I have a feeling will be around for a while! 

One of the really cool things is they're green! They have registers by the company square, where you can have your receipt emailed to you, or if you really wanted to...there is the option to print it out. Also a few iPads for anyone to browse the net while they chill and free wifi throughout. 

They also have a fresh and very cool modern contemporary decor going. It's a refreshing addition to downtown Mississauga that is greatly needed. Well done guys well done!"}
{"text":"Came here again for the acai bowl and to try other food items. 
The acai bowl this time was unfortunately not as great. The acai blend was frozen and very difficult to eat, which greatly detracted from the dish. The granola was still on point at least. 

Also tried the pesto portobello toast and jalapeno bean taco. Both of them were fabulous. The pesto on the toast was so delicious and flavourful! The taco was wonderfully fresh and savoury. The tacos were on the drippy side because of the liquidly jalapeno sauce, and unfortunately they were served on just a wooden board, so there was nothing to catch the dripping sauce on. I ended up with sauce dripping off the board and all over the table. 

My biggest gripe with the food is that everything is served with white bread, white tortillas. If The Cold Pressery is trying to promote healthy lifestyles, then they should, without a doubt, be serving whole wheat, or at least multigrain bread. That seems like a no-brainer to me. Everyone knows that white bread has absolutely no nutritional value."}
{"text":"I enjoy the atmosphere at The Cold Pressery a lot, you can tell that they've taken a lot of care in their design and concept. Lends more to a cafe where you are welcome to do you work/homework, chill and play board games with friends, or just stop by to pick up a beverage. 

I've been here a couple of times and tried different items each time. I've really enjoyed everything I've tried. I've tried the Melon Mojito bottled juice, matcha lemonade, tropical green smoothie and 5&10 smoothie. Of them my favourites have been the matcha lemonade (way better then the 1 that Starbucks tried, very refreshing) and the 5&10 smoothie (coffee, banana and dates, really filling and flavourful). 

Do try some of their food items as well. Tried the raw tiramisu and although it wasn't really like a traditional tiramisu in taste or texture, I did enjoy it for what it was, surprisingly rich and creamy tasting too. I'll be returning and trying more, I've heard good things about their portobello tacos."}
{"text":"Great menu with lots of interesting and healthy vegan options. The atmosphere feels like an independent downtown coffee shop. As someone who doesn't usually eat vegetarian or vegan, I will say, the food is delicious.  The tacos are amazing. The smoothies are incredible. I always get the Hulk's favorite. A must try if you're into healthy eating."}
{"text":"Can I just say omg?! I'm not vegan but if food tastes like this for all non-carnivorous food, I'm willing to commit. How good the food was here really threw me off given it's in an offbeat plaza in the middle of nowhere. 

First of all, the ambiance is relaxed similar to a warm lodging cafe setting. They never rush you and the seating and decor makes you want to settle in and work away or catch up with an old friend or colleague. The space itself for what is worth is quaint and fits people snug but nicely without having the feeling of walking through sardines or tiptoeing around eggshells avoiding peoples feet. 

The pricing is reasonable at $5-8 a sandwich/food, and the drinks at another $3-$5. Its around $10 per person which is low in the current market after minimum wage price hike. For those healthies out there this place is fully equipped with vegan, soy, green options. The toast with tomatoes was well presented and had multiple flavors as they roast the tomatoes so that it's hot with a tinge of sour tomato loveliness. The bed of bean spouts underneath creates the added texture without taking away from the overall taste. The bread underneath was soft and not over toasted layered with fresh guacamole that creamy bliss that ties the entire plate together. What can I say... definitely a pleasant surprise. Ample parking space in the plaza it's located in. Seems like this gem is popular because it was packed on a Saturday afternoon. It's close enough to drive from square one only two min away from the heart of action in Mississauga but definitely more of a destination cafe given that it's not on route to anything. Looking for a higher end non-starbucks/second cup option without dishing out extra cash? You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Great service, great food/drinks and fun atmosphere. Whether you want to come with friends/family or get some work and studying done, it is the perfect place."}
{"text":"The cold pressery is truly a hidden gem. The walls were filled with chalk art and creativity. Near the entrance, you will find their most popular items including their \"Hulk's Favorite\" which is almond milk, almond butter, hemp seeds, banana, spinach and kale smoothie (refer to my photos). 

They was also plenty of natural light and about 20 seats. However, there wasn't much of a scenery (their chalk art more than compensated for it). 

After looking around and testing their ipad stations, I finally decided on the Matcha Latte. There was only one staff at the time and our drink took longer than we thought (about 10-15mins). The drink was great but there was so much ice in the drink that we were left with more than half a cup of ice when we finished the drink. (please refer to my photos) 

Overall I will definitely come again. I love the environment, the food choices and the seats."}
{"text":"This tiny little vegan place is what Mississauga/Square One needs more of. I came here with my cousin who spoke very highly of their smoothie bowls. We ordered some healthy shooters (you can choose from a selection of 6 I believe, Turmeric and ginger to name a couple), açai bowl, avocado smash toast, and chipotle bean tacos. 
The açai bowl is huge! Very delicious, can really pick out the different flavours of bananas and mango purée mixed with the Açai, and the flax granola used as topping is crunchy and DELICIOUS. Everything is with fresh fruits and coconut whipped cream, so good! 
Moving on to chipotle bean tacos, let's just say they made me a believer. I now know for a fact that something can be 100% Vegan and 100% better than the original recipe. There's a mix of different kinds of beans forming the base, tomatoes, and heaps of crunchy purple cabbage filling the soft shell. Their chipotle sauce is spicy, but to die for, and I'm literally getting hungry just remembering how good these tacos were. I'm definitely due for another visit, and I can't wait to try their other tacos (both portobello- one creamy and one pesto). 
10/10 would recommend get those damn tacos!! 
Last and, unfortunately for this case, least, the avocado smash toast was a total blah. Compared to the explosion of texture and flavour offered by the chipotle bean tacos and the açai bowl, this was sad, tasteless, and quite frankly just bland. I've had some great avocado toast before, and sadly, this is not one of those times. However, I'm so pleased with everything else that I ordered that it literally didn't even bother me (the tacos guys, the tacos!)

The service is incredibly fast, the place is small so don't expect to find a seat when it's busy (which it tends to get- especially around Brunch time!). It had a modern hipster vibe to it, but damn if that's what hipsters eat, then call me a hipster because I'm hooked. 

TLDR; 10/10 great vegan food. Get the chipotle bean burritos, or the açai bowl if you're in the mood for something sweet."}
{"text":"A pretty nice place that offers vegan food and organic juices. The menu is simple and the food is good."}
{"text":"Nice spot near square one. I love that everything is vegan and mostly organic. I had the grilled cheese with mushrooms. It was tasty, except the cheese wasn't melted fully. Coffee and cookie were great. Bathroom was clean. Customer service was great. UPDATED: took my vegan sister here and I swear she spent $50 on food. She absolutely loved it. Five stars"}
{"text":"My friend was going through a vegan phase, so I came here with her. It's a cute little vegan cafe in Mississauga. First off, I love the mural on the side wall. It's a cityscape of downtown Mississauga and is really well done. The place has a hipster-student vibe. So I guess lots of students come here to hang out or get some work done. Very friendly environment.

We came in the middle of the afternoon, so didn't order any food. I got their matcha green tea latte, which I liked. Decent matcha flavour, and the almond milk was a nice twist from what I'm used to. Cashier was very friendly, and service was really quick.

Would probably come again and try some more drinks and hopefully some food as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the very limited all vegan eats in Mississauga. I love the decor and atmosphere of this cafe style restaurant. The grilled cheese sandwiches are delicious and the baked goods are scrumptious. All items are quite pricey which is the only negative, especially their drinks which can go up to $8!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! From the outside sign to their interior design to their food! 

As I entered, I was immediately greeted! I like how their menu isnt right behind the counter, it just looks more organize and it sections people whom are ordering away from the people whom are still contemplating on what to order. 

There's enough seats for about ~30 people-ish. Their interior design is clean and artsy with a west coast feel to it. I also like that they have a water with lemon slices dispenser to help yourself.

I ordered the acai bowl and it was heavenlyyyy! The tasty oats, and seeds are crunchy even when its been soaking in the creamy berry pureè. The strawberry, blueberries and mangoes were sweet and fresh! The coconut cream was the best thing I've ever tasted in my lifeeee! I wish I could buy a can of it! 

I totally recommend this place if you want a healthy and tasty alternative. The prices are not cheap but you get what you paid for. Pretty good portion size as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went today with my fam, including my very non vegan son, for my bday dinner. I loved my grilled cheese on gf bread and the guys had avocado toast, which they loved. We all had the matcha latte which was warm and comforting. My son was very impressed so far. He was still hungry so he ordered the Reuben but didn't care for the vegan cheese in it. We had the açai bowls that all of us loved with the fruit, granola and coconut whipped topping.
Then my son had the tea, which he enjoyed.
We were about to leave when they set up for a comedy show that they have every Tuesday night. No cover charge, just stay and enjoy. 5-6 comedians doing 10 minute sets....very enjoyable night. They had the whole place sing happy birthday to me and they gave me a vegan brownie with a candle. We even won a gift card in a social media contest!! So much fun...happy birthday to me"}
{"text":"Such a great place! My siblings and I love coming here for the chocolate maca and hulk smoothies. The pastries are great, the donuts are so airy and tasty. Service is also great too. I haven't had time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere but I notice the games at the back so that's a nice addition. 

Smoothies are a tad expensive, so that's why I docked off a star."}
{"text":"For those directionally challenged, finding this place may be an issue (or we just didn't use our heads). When you turn left into 4310 Sherwoodtowne Blvd, don't park at the actual building labelled 4310. Seriously, we parked and went inside the office building - which, confusingly, lists The Cold Pressery as Unit 5, and almost stepped into the elevators to explore the office building (but we needed a security pass). Walked around the building, still no sign of TCP. It felt like we were on The Amazing Race and we were losing. Until someone told us there's a retail portion separated off from the 4310 building - drive down to the retail concourse below, and it's there. Definitely didn't use our heads with that one - luckily, we finally found it!

First, ambiance. What an awesome, laid-back vibe. Relaxing, casual, yet still super trendy.

Second, the menu. Pretty extensive menu - many options to choose from. We came in for a drink of some sort and ordered, a) The Choco-Maca Shake, and b) The Iced Matcha Latte. The shake is out of this world - you can taste a world of super healthy yet delicious flavours. It's fruity, nutty, chocolatey, hints of almond, not artificial tasting at all, and a really cold and refreshing drink that makes you feel like you aren't drinking something bad for you. On the other hand, the Iced Matcha Latte was fine but nothing spectacular. It was really watery, which may have to do with the amount of ice they put in it (ask for less ice if you get this).

Overall, we found it pretty pricey for the size of the drinks - I didn't think the Iced Matcha Latte warranted $5.00, especially since most of it was very watery. On the other hand, I would pay the $7.75 for the Choco-Maca shake again. You definitely feel like you're getting something more substantial (which matters to me, at that price point, almost $8 for a drink).

So, perhaps pass on the iced lattes and go straight for the shakes - better value and substance. Overall, a cool place to hang out with friends, grab food or a drink, play some of the board games archived off towards the back of the restaurant. I'll be back to try out more of the smoothies/shakes.

For two people, our two drinks cost around $14.00."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try out this new hot spot! The interior is super trendy with free wifi and iPads to use. Customer service is awesome! Service is fast and efficient. Now for the food... I took my vegan sister here for a lunch date and we tried a few different items. Because of the reviews I was expecting out of this world vegan/gluten free/ dairy free cuisine, however it was alright in my opinion. I used to be vegan a few years back and honestly I can find way better food downtown or on lakeshore. 

It felt like every item we tried was lacking that extra umph in flavour. The prices were a tad high... But all in all I can appreciate a vegan joint like this in the heart of square one. 3.5 for food and 4.5 for atmosphere and service. Rawtella toast was ok but $5 for 2 slices of gluten free chia bread toasted with a spread is again a bit much since I can buy a whole loaf of gluten free bread at that price. Try the Acai bowl... That was our favourite item!"}
{"text":"Very small portions, tacos were stale and falling apart. Pumpkin pie crust was not good. Last time tacos came in 3s now they serve 2 tacos per meal. Tiramisu is $5.50 and it is literally two bites. This place is over priced."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of The Cold Pressery's delicious smoothies - Tropical Green is my fave - and Avocado Mash Toast! 
I've also enjoyed the Chipotle Bean Tacos - the sauce has a nice kick without mega heat - and the Vegan Grilled Cheese - I highly suggest adding grilled portobello mushroom + spinach. 
If you have a sweet tooth, they have gluten-free dessert options and vegan donuts - the pistachio is to die for! These sweet treats complement their awesome selection of coffee (espresso, latte, americano), matcha (tea, iced tea or lemonade), hot chocolate or rose tea. 
The acai bowl is another one of my favorites...so refreshing on a hot summer day! 
In the winter, I'll take a wellness shot - spirulina, camu camu, apple lemon ginger or chlorella - at the first sign of a cold. 
The atmosphere is cool too! Free wifi + spacious tables make it a great spot to work or study."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away behind condos. Great service with vegan food that actually taste good. It's more like a café style then a restaurant so don't expect fancy meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place! Excellent and very smooth cold-pressed juices. Great gluten free tacos and sandwiches. Superfood desserts. A real gem of healthy and tasty food in Mississauga!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and health shop in Mississauga. There menu is unique with lots of healthy options"}
{"text":"Decided to come in today with a few friends as I really wanted to see what all the hype was about.

The place itself is really nice in its decor. Very trendy, very clean with a ultra hipster atmosphere. I found the place to be very cute, decorative and very clean.

I decided upon a strawberry/banana smoothie made with almond milk and flax seed. I didn't like it at all, it must have been the flax seed. I make smoothies at home all the time with almond milk so I'm guessing it was the flax.

I get that the place is organic but for me it just didn't taste good. Other than that I have nothing really to complain about. Employees working behind the counter were friendly.

Would I come back?, I don't think so.."}
{"text":"Got a TLT and a 5 to 10 smoothie. Loved both. Definitely coming back more often! 
The atmosphere is great. Welcoming decor. They gave a variety of board games. Perfect place for a casual gang out."}
{"text":"The only reason that I gave The Cold Pressery 4 stars instead of 3 is because I'm not a vegetarian. And I'm not sure if I'm a good judge of a veggan cafe. The Melon Cucumber Mint Juice was $7.00 for a small bottle. It tasted OK but not nearly as good as fresh grapefruit juice I press at home. So for me, this review is really not about the food. 

If I went back, it would be for some dessert and a coffee and hopefully get a seat to chill and relax for a bit. The environment inside is great for that. The interior may be trendy but I'm not so sure about the location (in a strip mall overlooking the bridge across Rathburn to Hwy 10). The interior design is cool, however I can't help but picture a large pizza oven built into the wood laminate wall behind the front counter. Overall its clean and somewhat comfortable (not what I would call \"cozy\").

The tomato basil soup was good, however the croutons helped. The apple pie was underwhelming, smallish in size and very \"flat\". The whipped cream beside it (even if it was 'veggan') was the best part. The portobello and avocado toast was good, however be prepared to order two of anything, if you're hungry. 

Two tomato basil soups, a grilled cheese, 2 apple pie and one Chia Chocolate pudding, and espresso and a matcha tea came out to $55.00. I believe in eating healthy, however the value hear may not do it for you, especially if you're not a veggan."}
{"text":"Wow, who ever thought eating vegan can taste sooo good!!  The Cold Pressery is one of those places that being a \"Meatarian\" would be taboo to visit.  I decided to give it a shot based on all the positive Yelp reviews.  The location is a little confusing as you can enter through Rathburn or the side street.  The store itself has a cool urban feel.  Dark panels of wood, blackboards with cool designs and chalkboard art with the sin-aural urban beats create the mood.  Plenty of seating as well with cool wood panelled tables.  If your looking to check your email, there are iPads along the window to use.  

My first foray into the Cold Pressery menu was the munched hyped \"Hulk's favorite\" smoothie.  Almond milk, kale, spinach, almond butter, banana and hemp seeds round out this green concoction.  The taste....smooth...rich..and freaking awesome!!! The price is a $8 bucks...a little on the higher side..but the quality and taste of the product IMHO warrants it.  The menu consists of other smoothies, light snacks and desserts...all on my must try list when I am back in Mississauga.  

Cold Pressery is a chill..hip..place to hang out..check your email...grab a smoothie...write a review...and eat healthy......5 Stars"}
{"text":"A small, tucked-away cafe in the heart of the city was the only thing lacking in Mississauga. We were thrilled by options and ambiance. Disclaimer: portion sizes are relatively small, but filling. We ordered the chipotle tacos (it's a house special), pesto portobello avocado toasts, and splurged on a chocolatey donut. Truthfully, I had one of the best cups of coffee I've had in the GTA, and am craving another cup now."}
{"text":"Great vegan juice bar in the heart of Mississauga. Been here quite a few times and it never disappoints. My go-to's are the açaí bowl and the chipotle bean tacos. My favorite drinks are the remedy and melon mojito. 

If you have a sore throat, you need to order the remedy, as the mix of apple, ginger, lemon and cayenne pepper bring quite a bit of relief. 

The juices tend to get a bit pricey especially if you decide to buy more than one but due to quality and taste, I find that it is fairly reasonable. Kind service and free wifi is also a plus."}
{"text":"I love hipstery juice/health food bars so this was somewhere that made me pretty happy. however I will never be able to get past how expensive these types of places tend to be! it's great because all the ingredients are fresh and healthy so it's guilt-free and the tacos sound amazing (can't wait to try those) but I'll have to go on a \"treat yo self\" day because of the higher than desired prices."}
{"text":"So glad theres a vegan place in mississauga! Their soft bean tacos were really delicious, same with the tofu sandwich. Like  other  reviewers  expect  to pay 20$ for food and smoothie/juice. Money is worth it if you want a healthy, filling meal. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"After years and years and YEEEEEARS (OK, more like 3 years) of wanting to visit, I finally made my way down to The Cold Pressery at 2 pm on a lovely Wednesday afternoon. 

To start, this place is a little tricky to find! It's tucked away on the lower level of a small plaza, and if you're not careful, you'll miss it! I drove around once or twice before finally finding where it was and snagging a parking spot. The inside of the cafe is super cute and it was quite busy with people sitting at tables drinking their coffees, eating their lunches or pastries, or just on their laptops doing their own thing. Cool!

Now, I may have built this place up in my head a bit but ...... it really wasn't anything to shake a stick at. My partner and I ordered a coffee, one of each macaron flavor (strawberry, matcha and coffee), 1 chocolate banana muffin and two of the LAST Bloomers donuts that were on display.

The coffee was fine. I got a latte and my partner got his black. I can't complain- coffee is coffee! But the macarons .... truly awful. Really. And I'm really not trying to be harsh or mean, but they were SO GROSS. The consistency itself was really strange. Almost sticky in your mouth and sticking to your teeth. The flavours were so (SOOOO) gross and very artificial. The strawberry macaron tasted like bad, cheap strawberry candy. The matcha was .... ok. And the coffee flavour macaron tasted burnt, kinda like meat??? And a little bit cardboard-y. Really. The donuts and the muffin though; can't complain! I looooove chocolate banana baked goods, so that was a DEFINITE WIN! The vegan donuts were also pretty tasty! I was disappointed that there wasn't any variety to choose from (we got the last two plain vanilla ones) but I will definitely be making a trip down to Bloomers (donut provider to The Cold Pressery) in the near future to try some more!

Overall it was an ok experience. I don't think I'll be going back. couple with he fact that this place is REALLY EXPENSIVE ($28 for my whole order), it wasn't that great. But I encourage you to try it for yourself and see."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, healthy food, priced as you would expect from a nice vibe healthy food place...a little up there. 
Hulk smoothie and tacos are good.
Would come back when desperate for something close and healthy."}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem in Mississauga. Perfect spot to bring a vegan date.

Their hours suck, which is too bad, because its a great hangout. The hours have changed again."}
{"text":"The Cold Pressery is a great place to go to for hangouts with friends or a casual date - if you can find it lol! It's just below the BDC building in the Sherwoodtowne plaza which is a bit of a maze to get to from Rathburn but once you get there, it's worth it! 

Inside, there are some larger tables for groups, smaller ones for more intimate days/nights out, comfy chairs in one corner and another table with bar stools facing the window. They even have board games on the side too! Such a nice alternative to coffee shops or bubble tea places.

They have great meals for lunch such as the chipotle bean tacos or the mushroom tacos - both are good! The chipotle bean taco has more of a kick and a bit more filling than the mushroom taco but the mushroom is light and savoury too. Other good meals here that I've heard of are the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich, which you can add other toppings to. I'm definitely going to try that one on my next trip!

I've tried their raspberry and cream paletta here - delicious and perfect after a delicious lunch! My friend also enjoyed her watermelon lemonade paletta. They have other yummy looking desserts here like waffles, donuts, puddings and pies.

Their prices are reasonable - under $7 for a filling meal and desserts are under $4 or $5 from what I remember. Their smoothies seem a bit more pricey for $7 or $8 but I've heard they're good and nutritious of course. Definitely check out this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance this place offers. It's a nice little spot to get some work done or catch-up with a friend - a more rustic alternative to Starbucks. 

The workers there are nice and friendly and the avocado smash is a must have - so good! 

I've also seen people play board games here and they have a small collection as well. Most of their menu items are vegan and they also have gluten free options which might appeal to more people. They have cupcakes too!

Their prices are more on the expensive side but it's worth it if you're going to hang out there. Would be too expensive for takeout juice for my tastes. Their cold pressed juices go for about $8 for a small bottle (350ml?) and are very mild/lacking in taste. There are better juiceries in Toronto. 

Overall it's a nice spot tucked away in the middle of mississauga. I would come back here to work or grab a snack with friends."}
{"text":"We went to this eatery called Cold Pressery (near square one). Its a vegan place. My son immediately said that he wont go in, lol.  I told him we should try something new.

It is quite a busy place.  My son ordered a smoothie with kale, spinach and few other veggies and a cookie and cream vegan donut. The donuts sizes are really big.  I thought it would be doughy but it was light and tasty. For $3 it was worth it.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato. You could not tell it was vegan!  The grilled cheese is $4 plus an additional $1 for tomato.

They also have tacos, hot and cold sandwiches, cranberry brie french toast, crepes and waffles.  If I am in the area, I will definitely try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"4.5 As far as unique places in Mississauga go, this one definitely hits the mark!  Does NOT feel as though you're in the 'burbs.

I'd call this place a juice/snack bar/place to chill out.  As soon as you walk in, there's a  menu and a rather impressive interior - very Westcoast feel!  I met both of the young owners and they seemed very sweet.   

After seeing the male owner give a demonstration of cold coffee, and not having a morning cup of Joe, I was intrigued so I ordered 1 + a smashed avo toast.  Coffee was SOO good and surprisingly refreshing!  Probably the best iced coffee that I have had since Portland...seriously.

Tip:  Ask for less ice as my disposable cup was full to the BRIM with cubes.  I'd prefer more coffee and less frozen water.  ;)

Smashed Avocado Toast - Delicious as well!  A bit pricey at $8 for 2 slices.  I shared with a friend and it was a good 'snack'.  In terms of savoury snacks, I think the toast was the only thing they had available.  Other than that, they did have the Acai Bowl which also looked delicious!

As a new business, I wished that they had offered samples of their various drinks for new customers to try.  Only a suggestion, but it would've been nice.

Atmosphere though was very nice and relaxing.  Highly recommend a visit here if you're in the City Centre area!"}
{"text":"Very hip and Socal style spot. This place is perfect for vegans and healthy foodies. Even if you aren't trying to be vegan or healthy, the food is still delicious. 

I came in for lunch, though the food is more suited for perhaps a snack? I ordered the avocado smash and my brother had the creamy portobello taco and acai bowl. First of all, the avocado bread was delicious and perfect for a light lunch. My brother said that the tacos were also quite good, but he said that the acai bowl is the best he's ever had( and we are from cali). 

The ambiance is my favorite. This place gives off a very hip and upbeat vibe. This is definitely a place to hangout with friends at. They also have board games. 

Service was alright. The staff are all teenagers. Not saying that millennials give worse service(as I am one myself), but there def is carelessness. However, this type of service is perfect for a teen hangout spot. 

I am very impressed with this place and might come back next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"I was working in the area for 2 weeks. Visited the place about 5 times. Loved it! 

Their smoothies are amazing. If you love chocolate I recommend getting their Choco Maca smoothies. It has a chocolatey taste without being too sweet. 

I recommend their tacos. They are tasty and filling.

This place is awesome, doesn't give you that guilty feeling when you indulge on sweet things cause all their ingredients are healthy and fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and I'm bummed that I didn't find this place sooner! It would've been perfect spot to get a refreshing drink, hangout and study/work in throughout the summer. 
We got the acai bowl and the tropical green smoothie. Both were great! The acai bowl in particular was perfect, topped off with a coconut vegan whipped cream. 

The two employees there were super friendly and patient, they even helped us decide what to order with their suggestions!

Both the interior and exterior of the store were very charming and welcoming. I love the design of the logo, menu, and the layout of tables, chairs etc. Reminds me of San Francisco. They even have a table with iPads on them that you can use!

Overall, great place and a must try. So happy that there's a great juice bar in this area. Perfect for a brunch, a refresher and/or dessert and you don't have to feel guilty about it  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Casual diner serves organic vegan dishes. Simple but delicious.  Prices are fair.  Entrance off Rathbun Rd easy to miss."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the cold pressery for awhile but haven't had a chance (husband refuses anything vegan). I stopped by in need of an \"on the go\" breakfast. Being gluten free, it's pretty hard to find those options. I got the five and ten smoothie which is a blend of coffee, almond milk, dates, hemp hearts, cacao nibs and I think banana but I'm not sure. I also got the smashed avocado toast on gfree bread. The toast was delish, though the avocado aspect was a little thin. There was grilled tomato and sprouts over the avocado. I would definitely order that again. The smoothie is also good and you *almost* can't taste the dates. I do not like dates at all but I can enjoy this smoothie. 
The prices are pretty steep - I paid $13 for my order. But that's expected at these types of places. I'll definitely be back to try other menu items and possibly re-order the avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Finally tried a smoothie here. Amazing stuff, looking forward to my next visit. Some interesting menu options for sure."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service. I've been there 3X - horrible customer service. Young and entitled staff. Attempted to order and purchase juice recently over the phone and had the worst experience - they put the phone on the counter and h staff were speaking about me in the rudest way! Unprofessional. For an organic food-energy juice bar, the hired staff is entitled and horrible. The owners/manager seem lovely, too bad their staff represents them in the worst light."}
{"text":"One of my colleagues introduced me to this lunch spot and I'm hooked!

Don't let the unassuming plaza fool you, at The Cold Pressery, you'll find healthy vegan smoothies, lunch options and desserts in a cute and cozy atmosphere! 

Their acai bowl topped with fruit and coco whip, brought me back to my days in Australia and I love their vegan grilled cheese and tomato soup combo! 

Will be back for many more lunches and snacks!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We really need more places like this in the suburban areas surrounding toronto.

Ambiance: I love the wooden tables, chalkboard walls, and stainless steel ordering counter. Otherwise all comes together nicely with the skyline of mississauga drawn on the wall. Whoever drew that is talented.  Check out the bathroom the drawing on the wall are pretty cool.

Service: consistently good! The staff are knowledgeable and patient with those that ask a lot of questions. *cough cough* me 

Food: Although they have a small menu I like everything I have tried. The Chipotle tacos are the bomb (please bring back the blue corn hard shell tacos), the grilled cheese (I always add mushrooms) and tomato soup is amazing. Best tomato soup I've ever had. I didn't even like tomato soup until I tried it here. They have doughnuts on the weekend and they are magical! You can bring anyone here and they wouldn't feel like they are eating vegan. It's just good food.  The Açai Bowl is a great ice cream alternative for my lactose intolerant peeps @britanysbites"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... smoothies and drinks are the best here.  Food are more snacks than a meal ... they're ok.

Finding great spots in Mississauga for the healthy and tasty is not easy.  I always had Cold Pressery on my list to try and seeing the number 4 stars is promising.  Though it is a short walk away from Square One, this location is actually quite hidden.  It's tucked away in a commercial residence with no direct access to Hurontario.  You would know it was there unless you were actively trying to find it.  

Parking here was fairly easy and quite large since it's for a few commercial buildings.  The spot itself is nicely decorated with a large drawing of the key Mississauga landmarks.  There is a number of tables available and during the Friday lunch, it didn't get crazy busy but most tables had a person sitting in it.  It looked like half the line was doing take out more than eating in. 

Their menu is on the wall with most of it being drinks.  There are a few food options but it's quite limited to toasts, tacos, and açai bowl.  Drink pricing is fair considering how much the norm and food prices reflect that they're more snack sized.  There's so customization here like some other spots but that keeps things fairly streamlined and quick to order.

Service here is fast... huge plus especially if you're just looking to grab and go.  I think the service is attentive and moves through the line quickly.  I think the worst wait I saw was maybe 5 minutes.  The food comes just as quickly since it's not very complicated.  Tacos came out less than the time to order after I paid and it's delivered to your table.

Portabello Tacos - At an affordable $6.50, you get 2 snack sized tacos.  Just a warning, if you ask for corn tortilla, it does survive the sauce better and doesnt disintegrate before your eyes.  BUT it is an absolute mess to eat as it's about 30% smaller so the shredded purple cabbage falls everywhere with the cashew sauce.  I would say this was quite mild overall in flavour... Sure you had texture of the soft portabello, light crunch from the cabbage, and creamy from the sauce ... but nothing tasted strongly of anything.  I doused it with tobasco to give it a needed flavour boost.  3/5

Chipotle Bean Tacos - This was similar to the portabello tacos except it was so hard to eat.  The sauce was soaked up immediately by the flour tacos and just fell apart.  This isnt a good thing within minutes of being served.  As for flavour, it's quite light... nothing exciting or good to make us order this again.

Tropical Green Smoothie - One of the better smoothies coming out of Mississauga.  This was well blended and moderately sweet.  Though it's green from the kale and spinach, it doesnt feel like a pureed salad... rather the sweetness from the pineapple and mangoes.  Pineapples were the strongest flavour.  It was a very refreshing drink for a super hot day.  4/5

5 & 10 Smoothie - Definitely better than the previous attempt we had for a coffee, cocoa, and date smoothie.  This one was smooth and not too sweet.  It had a stronger bitter coffee note that stayed in all the sips.  The dates and banana wasn't prominent... just offering a mild sweetness.  Definitely a creamy smoothie but I liked the Tropical Green a lot more.  3.5/5

Definitely a good option to grab some nice smoothies that aren't filled with added sugars or syrups.  I think I'll come back to try other fruit and vegetable based smoothies to see which ones I like.  With the super quick service, I think dashing in and out to feed my thirst would be easy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. We ordered some soup, grilled chese, smoothies and bowls.

Estheticly, the space is very appealing. They have the menu on the wall as soon as you walk in with pictures and prices. Beautiful wall decal and eye catching space arrangements. They even have board/card games for you to take to your table! 

The smoothies were fresh and sooo yummy. Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for smoothies i tried the green hulk one and it is delicious, havent tried the food yet but it looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place - it's healthy, welcoming, very well decorated and it makes me feel like a cool hipster haha. I've been here more than ten times and it never disappoints. 

Service & Environment
Friendly staff and fast service. You can take out or you can sit in their very spacious and clean seating area. iPads and phone chargers are available for use. They also provide games for you and your friends to sit back and relax!

Food:
Smoothies:
I usually get the Banana Berry smoothie and I love it! However it does taste a bit bland to some people but being someone who doesn't like my smoothie too sugary or sour, I really like how it's light. 

Acai Bowl:
My absolute favourite thing to get here. It kind of tastes like an acai and mango frozen yogurt with a smoother texture. It's then topped with coconut whipped cream, berries (strawberry & blueberry), bananas, seeds and nuts. Super healthy and refreshing. A must try at this place. 

Sandwiches:
Avocado Smash - Panini bread topped with a generous portion of avocado, arugula and tomatoes; delicious!

Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup - For only seven dollars this is a great deal. The portions are pretty big! Grilled cheese is made with vegan cheese which was surprisingly very good!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy I got to meet Sivon - owner and master barista/chef at Cold Pressery. Sivon, if you're reading this, sorry for the late review!

The place is awesomely friendly and hip in all the good ways possible. None of that pretentious hipster vibe - just friendly vibes from the happy couple who own the place. Their main selling points are the vegan options for drink and food. 

Their drinks are tasty and the food is awesome - especially for a non-vegan, I was skeptical. The bean options do well and they fill you up with awesome nutrients. As a dietitian, I can say that most Canadians should have more non-animal proteins to help decrease saturated fat intake and to increase the fibre that we consume. 

As for the fruity options and the caffeinated beverages, they don't sweeten their drinks that much and you can always customize the amount of sugar. Obviously they and I would recommend having less sugar just to ensure you really get the taste of everything that goes into the drink. It also helps to decrease sugar intake which is already prevalent in nearly everything that we eat and is processed.

The venue is a little hard to find but use the pics that are found here! Otherwise, the inside looks awesome and has a bunch of electrical plugs for students and others just wanting to get some work done while sipping on nice drink.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend. It was great. I ordered the chipotle bean tacos, with a matcha macaroon and my friend, the grilled cheese, with a cookies and cream macaroon. We started off with the macaroons. They were amazing. My new absolute fave. Cream was fluffy. The cookie was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Absolutely delicious- we had to try two more. The tacos were a bit too saucy for my preference but were delicious in presentation, texture and taste. Not to mention they are only $6.50. Her grilled cheese was great as well. Crispy, cheesey, and delicious. Will definitely be back again. Can't wait to try more items!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a colleague. Vegan cafe with a lot of different types of cafe items. They have really great smoothies, juices, donuts, and muffins. 

I never had vegan before but the donuts they have here every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are big in size and taste. They were succulent and delicious. 

Usually people get turned off when they hear vegan but thats not the case here. Don't be fooled. Definitely give this place a try and see for yourself. Healthy smoothies that are tasty are hard to find but this place has it."}
{"text":"First time here, and immediately after walking through the doors, I love the decor! Their menu presentation is appealing and straight to the point! It's so visually appealing! The tables, the walls, just about everything I really like the vibe. Me and my friend got the açai bowl, and it's so delicious. Would definitely recommend this to anyone! It is a bit chilly inside though, but maybe that's because they are a cold pressery  other than that, found my new chill spot  currently contemplating what food to order but having a hard time because they all look so bomb"}
{"text":"It was thanksgiving Monday, so was pretty surprised to hear that this place was open. 
After seeing many ads about this place I finally decided to give it a shot. I went with my mum, since she's a vegetarian, so would be a good place for her with many choices.
The restaurant was empty when we arrived, although a few people did come in to pick up some of their healthy juices to go. 
The menu was simple with not too many items. 
My mum chose to order the tlt sandwich and I went for the jalapeño bean taco. The food arrived within 10 minutes.
From the first bite, my mum and I were speechless. We were simply in awe to the taste of our food. 
The thought of vegan food being so delicious simply baffles me. The tacos were so flavorful and the jalapeño sauce made it extremely juicy and fresh tasting. 
My mum is a very fussy eater but even she was in love with her sandwich, whereby once we got home she immediately tried looking up recipes so as to find a way to make it.
I'll be visiting often and would love to try everything on the menu. 
Amazing place for sure. This place goes to show that quality is definitely better than quantity."}
{"text":"I read about The Cold Pressery through insauga.com as the top 5 indie cafes in this fantastic city. I had to check it out as everything seemed healthy and vegetarian. 

Happy:  It's hidden in a very small plaza two blocks away from Square One. Once you entered, you will be amazed at the black and white painting on the wall that showcase the neighbourhood. The same white ink is applied around the flat screen tv to make it more elegant as you read about the benefits of some veggies and fruits. Tables are made of wood and steel. It's modern and rustic at the same time. The floor is just cemented. The menu is painted on mini canvas hung on the wall neatly. I like how the artist used different font for each item. There are 2 iPads near the entrance for you to browse through the which is neat. 

The best part, bring some friends to play board games that they have on the shelf. Now that's special! They even have Cards Against Humanity!! 

Not happy:  I ordered a cold matcha drink when it wasn't busy yet. However, more people piled in and I had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a drink when the second girl came in to work. The drink was refreshing but half of it was ice so I was a bit disappointed. Next time, don't order with ice. You get more liquid for your bucks. 

Verdict:  This will be my new place to hang out while eating healthy food. Can't wait to try out their tacos!! You must be there to take everything in."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place for lunch, as I've lived 7 minutes away for 4 years now and never heard of it. I was a vegetarian for 10 years and am always looking for meat free/ dairy free / gluten free options. My wife and I ordered to share, as we wanted to try a few things, we ordered the grilled \"cheese\" with tomato soup and the Hulk smoothie. Both came out fairly quickly and were very delicious. I added mushroom to the sandwich which was a perfect addition - otherwise it would just be \"cheese\" and bread. The hulk smoothie was a great mix of ingredients and I would definitely order it again.

I went back up for an acai bowl and blended coffee and was really glad that I did. 

My only concerns were the lack of seating - this place was packed. And that there was no high chair for my friends 15 month old son, there seemed to be 3-4 infants there, although they did have a change table in the restroom. Now that I know about this place I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite eats in Toronto! As a vegetarian/aspiring vegan, this place has absolutely everything! I find myself needing to go once a month after I get that craving - I strongly recommend their TLT which is amazing!"}
{"text":"It is a pretty hidden place. But if you are near by it is a great place to have meetings and do work! Also there board games and light refreshments along with drinks! The whole place is made by vegan ingredients which is pretty unique on its own. One down side is a bit hard to find the place for the first time!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food, all day everyday. Get the melon mojito with avocado smash toast, and if you have the space for one more drink, get the iced macha green tea latte."}
{"text":"I go here all the time! It's 15 minutes away from my house and sometimes I just drive especially to grab a bite! Suggestions: continue to mix up/introduce new menu items like you have been doing over the past few months! The owner and even the rest of the staff are very friendly and you can tell they appreciate your business. The atmosphere is very welcoming!"}
