{"text":"This is hands down the best Lebenese fast casual restaurant in west island (probably Montreal) and I've eaten at most of the shawarma restaurants in the west island. Make sure to try the Tabouleh salad, and Falafel sandwich. Also when ordering with the lamb and beef shawarma, add the sesame dressing (tahina) it adds so much flavour!"}
{"text":"hands down the best in the west. never had a bad meal. shishtaouk, shawarma,falafel,all amazing.they make a fantastic lentil soup. fluffy rice, potatoes garlicky, but not TOO garlicky. merguez top notch. amir and boustan WISH they were Mr.Falafel."}
{"text":"Just ordered another falafel plate. Disappointing since the last time everything was perfect. This time the falafel were cold. Not warm or hot. Cold. So much for consistency!"}
{"text":"My go-to shish taouk and shwarma restaurant. The food is delicious, consistent, and quick. I usually have the potatoes with my plate, not the rice and they taste great, especially with the flavorful garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I was very excited to order from Mr. Falafel this evening.  I placed my order around 4:30pm directly on their website. Anyway, it is clearly marked that they deliver to the H9R area.  One can also find this restaurant listed on the Tasty Boom food delivery service as well.  I have double checked that I am indeed part of the delivery zone.  I received an order confirmation from Tasty Boom (as they are in charge of all the online orders).  After waiting for an hour and half I called the restaurant's direct line.  The person who picked up told me that a representative from Tasty Boom was supposed to call me because they had decided to cancel the order.  I never received any phone call, text, or e-mail stating that the order had been cancelled.  The Mr. Falafel employee also asked me, \"If I just placed a bunch of things in my order to make the minimum?\"  I then explained to him that I ordered what I wanted.  Also, I am not sure why \"what\" I decide to order is any of his concern as long as I meet the delivery requirements.  I expect that even if I was just ordering extra things I still would expect the food to be delivered.  I then called Tasty Boom and they told me that the restaurant had chosen to cancel the order because they felt like it wasn't \"worth it\" for them to deliver.  I would like to note that the website states a $20.00 minimum and my order was $25.00.  Also, the restaurant is located on Saint Jean's Boulevard and is a less than 10 minute drive from my location even with lots of traffic...what a joke and what a waste of time."}
{"text":"Garlic is amazing.   Portions are a bit small but the flavour is very good.   I got extra chicken on my shawarma wrap which was just enough. You can get extra by the dollar so like one dollar extra chicken or two dollars. They play soccer during your meal and the decor is old. But what that tells me is they are successful and don't need gimmicks to stay open.   It was worth the drive from YUL"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick, food was good, only that the potatoes were a bit hard but the flavours of the plate make up for it"}
