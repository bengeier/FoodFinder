{"text":"As an individual of south Indian heritage, I grew up with my grandmother and mother making food that very closely resembled the dishes that this establishment makes. The key difference between my experiences at saffron and those of my own family, are merely the hands which prepared it.   I can confidently say, after trying nearly every dish on their continuously rotating menu, that I have yet to have a single dish that was mediocre. They make a selection of their menu daily so as not to compromise their food quality by having several dishes sit.   If authenticity and uncompromising food quality is important to you, you should try out saffron.   Their aloo ghobi isn't just mashed potato and minced cauliflower like so many places seem to do. It has huge chunks of well cooked potato and cauliflower, which still has some consistency. Their Korma is actually not overbearing with the cashew paste, you can differentiate the constituent spices. Their veggie samosa is right on with seasoning and actually crisp.  My personal favorite has to be their Lamb vindaloo.  To which, you may ask them to make your order to your chosen spiciness level.   Their regular spice level would be mild-medium for the more adventurous.   Give this family run establishment a try. I promise you that my tastes are very decerning. This establishment has more than exceeded my expectation everytime I have been.   Even with all the good things going for them, their prices are the lowest average cost of any Indian takeout anywhere in the nw. There are a couple other places close(ish) by; however, saffron is superior and more economical.   Everytime I go, there are always a couple people getting their orders filled.   Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Indian food always offers some excellent vegan options, and Saffron had three on the warmer tonight. Something something with eggplant, something with chickpeas, and something something mixed vegetables. My two vegetarian entrees combo came with about a cup of white rice, a slab of naan bread, and cost about $12. The food was great.   The servers were pleasant and they knew where to steer me. If I ordered ahead from their menu I could get more custom options than their daily buffet, but they change the specials every day and I like rolling the dice."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy, and priced just right! This place offers take out only, and they do have daily specials. Ask them which dishes you should try! You usually can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian take away in the area. Rose the owner is really nice and by far a great chef of Indian cuisine.  The meals are filling, always different and delicious.  Try the butter chicken..  my favourite."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service and good prices. Got the combo #5 (which is two non-vegetarian dishes) and it was more than enough! Had left overs for the next day! Would HIGHLY recommend the butter chicken. Probably the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Picked up some veggie take out combo #1 which came with mixed vegetable curry, a bowl of rice and 2 halves of naan for less than $10 on our way to the airport. The food is sooooo good! I wish I'd come here earlier so I could have eaten here both days we were in Calgary. The portion was perfect for 2 people (we don't eat heavy dinners). The curry was really thick with tons of veggies. We'll definitely be back if we visit Calgary again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the butter chicken here. The food is fantastic and the service is good as well. The lady who owns it is really sweet and very helpful. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Saffron has me a bit torn.    One hand it's solid food, served quickly, friendly staff, and reasonable prices for Indian in the NW side of town.  On the other,  if I'm craving Indian it doesn't quite satisfy.   From someone who loves Indian food and had traveled to India and eaten the real deal - it's not quite to my quality of authentic.  For example,  the naan is closer to greek pita than I'd expect.  Not that I have an issue with greek pita... but just not always what I'm hoping for.  That being said, there isn't a lot of NW competition for Indian so it is sometimes better than taking a bit of a drive to something a little more authentic or going to a higher price point place that takes a while.    Saffron is a bit different that some restaurants in that they make a handful of dishes that day and you choose from those - not the menu unless you order in advance for a lot of people or something.   They will always have butter chicken and a dahl but other than that you'll have to call or just go check it out.   They will always have a few vegetarian dishes and then some with meat.  They often have ocra and saag which are far from my favourites - and that's sometimes a bit disappointing to me.   The good thing about Saffron is the food is made when you stop in (but does NOT taste like buffet style that's been sitting) so it's quick to stop in and pick up.   The prices for the NW are not bad.  For a veggie combo you get 1 veg dish, rice, naan and a curry for $9.  Add a buck for a meat combo.  Add a couple bucks for a second veg dish.  A combo with 1 dish is more than enough for me most of the time.   A combo with 2 dishes is usually 2 meals if I buy more naan.  Overall that's not a bad deal when facing the cost of other NW alternatives.  Overall,  Saffron is definitely a good option to have around.  Review 3 of 30 in Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"The food at Saffron is amazing, we've never had anything that wasn't outstanding.  Phone ahead if you want a specific dish as they will make things to order, or just show up for a little adventure in your meal choice to go with the daily specials."}
{"text":"Feeling like Indian food the other night and didn't want to make the trek back downtown to Tandoori Hut (my favorite EI restaurant in Calgary) so looked around for somewhere closer to home.    Their menu has a decent number of choices and is priced fairly.  However finding the menu was a bit of a pain.  They have a website but has been taken offline so I had to go to archive.org to get a copy.  Not a big deal restaurants without a website is a HUGE annoyance for me. Anyways....ordering was quick and easy.    Arrived at the planned time and they were just assembling our order.  The staff was very friendly and helpful in getting everything well packaged and out to our car.    Now the important part of the review...the food!  We started with the \"mix & match\" appy consisting of 2 samosas (we took beef), 3 kababs and 6 pakoras.  The samosas were ok, not the best but still very tasty.  The kababs were tasty but very dry.  But the pakoras were amazing!  Perfectly spiced and very crispy.  For entrees we went with butter chicken, chicken korma, dhaal makhani and veg curry and here's where I'm conflicted.  While everything tasted good, nothing tasted like what I'm used to.  I like my butter chicken to have a noticeable tomatoy taste but theirs was more rogan josh sauce.  The korma, again it tasted good, didn't have much of a coconut taste.  The dhaal makhana was quite good.  The curry veg were well spiced and good selection.    My rating of 3/5 isn't completely fair in that the food & service were both good it just didn't have the tastes I've come to expect with EI food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but not the best place in town for East Indian food.  The service is fairly quick (about a 20 minute wait), the food is relatively good, and the staff are very friendly.  But, I've had better.  Just a warning, this is takeout style only-- there's no place to sit and dine in the restaurant.  Call in and place an order and go pick it up, or you can just order at the counter and wait about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I actually picked this up on Friday night,... for takeout and I finished the balance of it last night (so much better a day later allowing the spice to flow!). I highly recommend this establishment for anyone that appreciates great home cooked Indian Food (It is family owned, we met the mother and daughter). We enjoyed Vegetable Samosas, Safron Basmati Rice, Naan Bread, Chicken Curry and a Lamb Curry, Aloo Gobhi and a mixed vegetable curry! Will be returning for sure... Now I want curry again!"}
