{"text":"Friend shared a key lime coconut tassy that she got from here.  Three hours later I still can't get  the taste of cheap shortening out of my mouth.  First and last time for me."}
{"text":"Way too expensive and not very good.  I paid 8.99 for a dozen refrigerated chocolate chip cookies.  They were very bland.  For 8.99/dozen, i would expect them to be incredible.  Also, I bought a dozen buckeyes.  I bit in to one and was greeted by a thick black hair.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would.  DO NOT USE THIS BAKERY. I'm sure most times, the bakery is fine.  At this point, I couldn't even tell you if their stuff tastes good because I didn't even get that far.  If there is anything wrong with your order, expect to be treated poorly.  The customer is not always right at this establishment.  The owner is always right and doesn't make mistakes.  My experience was that when my brother showed up to pick up my 3 dozen custom cupcake order, they didn't even have it.  I had 35 people coming to my house in 3 hours for my daughter's fourth birthday party and they didn't have my order.  It was a high school aged girl working - the owner was off that Saturday.  She called the owner who said that I gave her the wrong date and there was nothing that could be done.  End. Of. Story.  Even I could whip up 3 dozen cupcakes in three hours if I had nothing else to do.  No accommodations at all.  The best part - she called the following week to see if I still wanted my order for the following Saturday.  This is when it got even worse.  I wanted to give her calm, constructive criticism regarding my disappointing experience.  She kept speaking over me and told me that I had given her the wrong date because how could she have written down a date that I didn't say?  There has never been a mix up like this and it had to be my fault.  She also told me that the \"young kid\" that picked up the order (my 30 year old brother) didn't seem to care at all that they didn't have them and so they figured the following Saturday would work for us.  DOES THIS EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE?  I am not one to write reviews unless something is so off the charts wrong (or fabulous).  For the most part, I think businesses should be able to do their jobs.  This has me completely flabbergasted and so appalled that I want to share with everyone.   So, what happened with my daughter's fourth birthday?  We called the Oakmont Bakery (which we always use, but decided to give Perfect Pastry a try since the Hulton Bridge was out).  They were able to accommodate my exact custom order except for the fondant decoration.  The owner of Perfect Pastry was happy that I found someone but informed me that it was because Oakmont Bakery freezes their stuff ahead of time and that is why the Perfect Pastry bakery is a quality bakery.  What is simply amazing is that the Oakmont bakery had the exact flavors and glittered frosting colors ...wow, good job Oakmont!  I don't want anyone else to go through the stress that we experienced - go elsewhere for your baked goods and save yourself a potential headache!"}
{"text":"I could literally live off their peanut butter chocolate chip bars. They have actually become legendary at my office, and completely-deservingly-so!"}
{"text":"Excellent bakery. Friendly staff and cookies that taste like home made so much better than the grocery store bakeries."}
{"text":"Shannon from The Perfect Pastry did 100 dozen cookies for our wedding, and they were absolutely spectacular! We've had cookies from TPP many times on several other occasions and felt good about choosing them, but we didn't expect the wedding cookies to be as fantastic as they were. We received tons of comments about how delicious they tasted and we didn't have many left once the night ended because everyone packed the take-home boxes to the brim.  Shannon was very professional, accommodating, and communicative. We wanted to make sure we could get our cookies to the venue's refrigerators before our wedding day, but we weren't sure when to come get them. Shannon was very easy to contact and kept us updated on what stage our order was in. She also trayed the cookies beautifully.  There's a lot to pick from at The Perfect Pastry. We were debating on getting decorated cut-outs to match our peacock-themed wedding, but we couldn't pass on the other selections. Their peanut butter blossoms, ladylocks, thumbprints, and buckeyes are among my favorites, but their linzer cookies are to die for!! They're so buttery and flavorful, and I ate way too many than what is probably healthy for one person.  I also recommend walking in to get some cookies. They have a great selection on site, but at least do not walk out of there without a container of buckeyes. My favorite used to come from Cracker Barrel, but The Perfect Pastry has them beat."}
{"text":"One day while I was a passenger on Route 8, I turned Yelp on and followed the road.  This bakery is one of the spots I found and bookmarked.  A few days ago, it happened to be open so we popped in.  We were greeted and offered complimentary ladylocks.  She also showed us around and pointed out their various specialties.  I'd hoped for buying a single cookie or two, which is possible with the elaborately decorated cut-out cookies, but the buckeyes and Pittsburgh specialties are sold by the dozen.  I'm glad we were pointed to the refrigerated case where there are sampler packs.  I thought about the peanut butter sampler (4 buckeyes, 4 peanut butter blossons, and 4 peanut butter cookies baked around peanut butter cups) because I am a peanut butter fiends, but I decided instead to get the sampler pack with 12 different cookies.  Most of the dozens, whether singular or sampler, were about $10.  I thought it would be fun to share all these classic Pittsburgh cookie-table cookies with my husband, and justified this purchase by planning to do a weird thing my family does: cut everything in even fractions.  I expected my mom to be offended that I bought all the cookies she knows how to bake at a bakery (I planned to use the come back \"but you don't anymore\") but both she and my dad were pleasantly surprised when I appeared on their doorstep.  It's been several days now and the 4 of us have been doing an incredibly disciplined job of nursing this sampler pack to its max. My husband had never had a buckeye before (dear ol' mom \"ran out of time\" and did not make them for the cookie table for our wedding!) but had only had most of the other varieties that one time at our wedding.  Still, two years out, it was fun to have again: kolaci, nut balls, pecan tassies, peanut butter blossoms, and buckeyes.  There was some sort of caramel-nut shortbread, a citrus-iced cut-out cookie, an excellent coconut macaroon, a miniature cheesecake, a chocolate cupcake, and maybe something else.  While no one cookie was knock-my-socks-off amazing, it was a really fun experience that lasted for days!  I agree with others that the baked goods here are a classic Pittsburgh experience.  If I lived here, I would consider getting the sampler for out-of-town visitors.  It mimics so many fond memories without the insanity of baking all twelve varieties yourself!  Edit: I originally posted this as a 4 star review.  I upgraded it to the full FIVE after I had the last two cookies (ssh don't tell the fam).  I was having trouble sleeping and they called to me from the refrigerator.  I am picky about cake, but the miniature chocolate cupcake was so fudgy it knocked my socks off.  In went all four little quarters of it.  Next went the peanut butter cookie with the peanut butter cup, which was good.  But it was the cupcake that was the surprise hit."}
{"text":"I got two birthday cakes at Perfect pastry. Both of the cakes were to die for and one of the cakes looked divine! But the other was tilted and the cake was uneven and the tried to level it out with more icing which caused it to collapse. If you ever go to perfect pastry I would recommend getting their cake pop, cupcakes, and macaroons!"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries that truly give a homemade perfection vibe. I have never been dissapointed with my order, and I highly reccomend the lady locks."}
