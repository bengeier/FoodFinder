{"text":"Great decor and great food.  Prices are very reasonable.  You can make a meal of the appetizers.  Order a variety and you will not be disappointed.  They are so good that they make the main courses pale in comparison, however, on their own, the main dishes are very good as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Kyomi twice over the past year, everytime for a birthday. I really enjoyed it.  It is pretty classy and the service is professional. 

Food is good and it it is always served in fancy ways ( for example my gf got some fried shrimps and the plate was an actual boat in miniature - pretty cool).
Another plus is that plates are huge !! I barely finished both times.

Prices are medium-high but for the good service and quality of food I would say it is worth it. Get ready to spend ~ 20-30. Oh and this is a BYOW (Bring your own wine) restaurant which gives it another plus.

Interior design is very cool, seats are incredibly comfortable !

A+ You should try it if you like asian cuisine!

Edit: I've been there for a 3rd time a few weeks ago, again for a friends bday. We got 2 tables upstairs, pretty separated from the rest. Very cool and private !"}
{"text":"This is a great place, the food is excellent the staff is fantastic and the ambiance is great.

They have done an excellent job with the interior, it is really a unique experience.

Also I noticed that there is some bad reviews on here, for anyone wondering I think the fact that this place is always busy says otherwise!"}
{"text":"It was a date night that I went to with my girlfriend. As soon as you enter the restaurant the decor is stunning. A greeter took care of us right away. The waiter that took care of our order afterwards was keeping  it simple and efficient but nothing extraordinary. My girlfriend took the pad thai and I took the chicken with peanut sauce with fried spinach. Both plates were  not as tasty as we would expect if we compare to other asian restaurants we've  tried before. The meat of the pad thai plate and the mushrooms of the chickien with  peanut sauce plate were cold which was a bit disappointing. The won ton soup was ok but again  not as tasty as other Asian restaurants we tried before. I would like to give this restaurant a second try because of the good service  and the decor but I find it really pricy (almost 80$ with the tip for 2 people) for plates that are not that tasty compared to cheaper restaurants. We did not try the fish and sea food though."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, service courtois, les sushis sont bons sans être excellents."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst \"fancy\" restaurant for Asian food... I was very disappointed even though I felt that the staff had good intentions and were making their best to give a good customer service.

{"text":"I went there last September with a group of girls and enjoyed everything from the food to the wonderful service. I went back early March with a lager group also had an amazing time. Food was once again great. I would definitely go back. 6 people or more they include 15% for tip, you can give more if you feel necessary. Bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"Been here over 10 times in the past year. Every time it doesn't disappoint. Service is very friendly. 

Decor is A+. It's a BYOW. Always great. They started having several types of promos for different days of the week which I think is nice.

If you come for groups, upstairs is very nice and intimate but the downside is that the kitchen is downstairs so the servers have to walk all the way down and back up to hand 3-4 plates at a time. Props to the waiters for their hard work.  

Sushi is fresh. I never order won ton soup as I believe it's banal but it's different here. Definitely order from the specialty menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and very good service but the menu is too small and the food wasn't that great. Keep in mind I went here for lunch so I believe that the menu is much bigger at night. I would probably return just for the ambience but I ordered a general Tao plate (yes very original) but only because there was nothing else that caught my eye, and it wasn't great. Was missing the flavor. I will give it another go one day but not just yet."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. It's local and the food is superb. I recommend the table d' hote if you're hungry. They introduced me to wasabi mayonnaise, I'm hooked. The waiters are all male and are fantastic. Really on top of things. The decor is super fun, love the lions in the bathroom. Oh! I forgot to mention, it's bring your own wine! Prices are great, not too expensive but not buffet cheap. Also, the place is huge, so it's great for parties. They have a reserved party area upstairs. All in all, we go here often and won't stop any time soon. I recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday & the place was pretty busy. Smelled amazing when I first walked in, and I was excited to eat! The wonton soup arrived; different broth flavour than I was expecting, and it had mushrooms, fried wontons and noodles in it... Unusual, not great, but edible. Then the harumaki arrived and reeked so strongly of fish that I didn't even want to put the plate in front of me! I cut off a piece, tried it with the sauce on the plate, and had to wash it down with water so i wouldn't gag. Revolting. 
The main course was the General Tao. What a disaster. Large pieces of baked chicken just positively drowning in sauce. This was not general tao. The sauce wasn't flavoured well, wasn't sticky, the chicken wasn't what you'd expect (smaller, fried pieces of chicken)... There was so much sauce, I don't know if they were trying to make their enormous plates look full? (these plates are the size of 2 dinner plates). We skipped the tea cause we figured they'd probably do that horribly too. 
I think people are giving this place good reviews simply cause it's a BYOW! I can't understand what else would be pleasant about this place otherwise. 
Never going back!"}
{"text":"Kyomi is a very modern restaurant with a spacious seating area. The staff are attentive and efficient.

Pros:
- Excellent sushi. We loved the mojito sushi roll, which was well presented and quite nice.
- The \"trilogy\" was decent. Would have liked to see the shrimp de-shelled before it was served. However, it was still enjoyable.

Cons:
- The cheesecake definitely tasted store bought. It was fine, but I would have liked to see something made in house. 

Overall, a very good restaurant in Lasalle. Bit pricey, but would recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a friend's birthday. We were seated upstairs. The decor throughout the entire restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The servers are friendly and the food is fantastic. I was extremely impressed. The portion sizes are huge and great quality. 

I would recommend booking a reservation as far in advanced as possible, as Kyomi tends to be fully booked around two weeks ahead of time."}
{"text":"I've been to Kyomi a handful of times over the past few years, and I've always been satisfied with the food and service. Their general Tao dish is amazing."}
{"text":"I've heard a few things about this place and was curious about Asian Fusion-style cuisine. I just recently found one of the $10.00 gift certificate that they gave out, so I thought it's as good a time as any to try it out.

After being seated by their hostess and browsing their sushi menu, I ordered the Aphrodite as it came with the Sunrise Salad entree (fruits and vegetables in a sesame vinaigrette with an orchid flower) , and the Besame Mucho maki, Spicy Salmon maki and Pizza Sushi (one of their house specialties that's as tasty as it sounds).

A little pricey in the end, but worth a try."}
{"text":"Central location on Newman, lots of seating.   
It gets very, very busy during the week at lunchtime, quieter at night.    I've been twice with friends and enjoyed it very much both times.
The food is totally fine (nothing that will take your breath away but it's good) but the decor will surprise you - it's gorgeous inside, especially when you remember you're in Lasalle, which isn't exactly known for high-end anything."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because it appeared intriguing. The decor was nice. I agree it was borderline garish. The place felt very clean. The prices were as expected. The food & service were exceptional, and very presentable. We had the wonton soup , unagi sushi and pineapple shrimp."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 because of the decor inside and not so much for the food.  Just went with a group of 20 ppl for a work party and the service was great. The deep fried dumplings and the shrimp tempura with the spicy mayo are the best.  I didn't really enjoy the general Tao though and wouldn't get it again. I also tried a piece of steak which they were selling for 40$ but tasted terrible. Overall nice experience but the menu needs to be changed a bit."}
{"text":"Very beautiful space luxurious setting, weekday nice & quiet: worth a 4 star. Food very very average & way too much cornstarch in my basil chicken and not enough basil & ginger. That's worth a measly 2 star - bringing the score to a paltry 3. Sorry. Not going back unless someone else picks up my tab."}
{"text":"Pour un lunch rapide, savoureux et copieux c'est l'endroit. 
Restaurant chic type fusion asiatique.
Choix de soupe wonton ou aux légumes. 
Le saumon sur plaque chauffante était très bon avec beaucoup de légumes .
Ma voisine de table a choisi le trip buf,poulet et crevette et à beaucoup apprécié. 
Prix très raisonnables
Stationnement facile."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but so worth it. Been here a few times now, came here Wednesday night with my boyfriend (we actually wanted to go to Campagnola on Dollard but much to our dismay you absolutely need to make a reservation for that place around the holidays).. In fact we almost were refused a table at Kyomi too...we agreed that 2 hours was more than sufficient for our dinner so they gave us a table. We came around 6pm and had to leave by 8 for the reservation coming in, there was going to be a live Big Band playing as of 7:30 which was exciting and I was sad we were going to miss, but our waiter graciously explained they play 2-3 times per year at Kyomi and reservations for these events are possible by keeping an eye on their website which will announce the events. The decor of Kyomi is beautiful, funky and chic, definitely Asian fusion style. We chose Kyomi (after campagnola) because it's BYOW and because it's a nicer/schmancier place than other BYOW's in the area. We had Kara Age - chicken tempura sushi as an entrée (which is pronounced AH-Gay btw so don't white it up like i did when u order it lol.) and it was amazing. The food was very good, I had the cubed steak in pepper sauce which was good but heavy on the sweet side (i really enjoyed all the veggies it came with though!), boyfriend had the Filet Mignon Teriyaki and it was so f***in good! Our waiter was fantastic, friendly, quick, efficient and anyone who doesn't let my wine glass empty is a friend of mine! The only ick of this place is I recommend you reserve a nice quiet table by the window in advance of your visit because we were seated in the middle of a group area and as it starts to fill up there's a lot of foot traffic and weird bozos bumping into your arms as they pass by your table to stand there and chat with each other which makes it not so enjoyable, so we left rather quickly but will definitely return with a reservation. Overall: so worth it."}
{"text":"Food : good taste and varied menu. Every type of person will be satisfied here. However the portions are way too big. The fried pineapple is very good and I definitely recommend it.

Decor : absolutely stunning. Great place for date night.

Service : nothing exceptional but they do deliver and take care of you.

Great place to bring friends.
I would give it 4* but I have rated other restaurants 4* that I think were better."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and years..the menu does not change much but that's fine .mid priced.. lovely pink setting with ultra cool bathrooms..great tables upstairs for large parties. Bring your own wine. 

The soup is by far my favourite won ton o have ever had..bring some to go..after all you can drink wine...it is an outstanding hangover cure"}
{"text":"Y'était grand temps que je découvre ce petit resto au coin de ma rue. Ouain je dis petit, mais my god, c'est énorme! À première vue le restaurant est vraiment beau, déjà l'extérieur est très attrayant avec ses arbres japonais roses illuminés et son arche majestueuse. En rentrant, on peu admirer un décor sublime, avec un petit ruisseau rempli de poissons et des grandes peintures et statues asiatiques. En plus, quand on rentre y'a comme une odeur incroyable qui nous donne encore plus envie de manger là.

Service poli, mais limité quand à la conversation (mais pas d'étoiles enlevées pour ça).

La bouffe. À prime à bord, le menu est limité. Ce que j'apprécie, parce qu'habituellement ça veut dire que le chef se concentre sur ce qu'il fait de mieux. En entrée, nous avons pris le duo de tatakis (Thon et Escolar flambé). Délicieux, vraiment. La portion était un peu limite pour le prix (14$/8mcx), mais nous avons beaucoup apprécié. Ensuite, nous avons pris le combo sushis Aphrodite (Maki Bésamé Mucho, Saumon épicé et pizza sushi - 35$). C'est là que ça s'est gâté. La pizza sushi était \"meh\" voir un peu fade sur le goût, et le maki Bésamé mucho carrément mauvais. Le saumon épicé, correct. Sans plus. Avec ça nous avons pris 2 nigiris au Thon et 2 au saumon. Eux était très bons. Nous avons bien remarqué que le poisson et le riz étaient frais et de très bonne qualité. (2mcx/6$) Voilà pourquoi, nous avons décidé de terminer le repas avec une commande supplémentaire de Nigiris 4 de chaque (à deux).

Over all j'ai moyennement apprécié mon expérience de sushi au Kyomi, surtout aux prix qu'ils chargent, mais je donnerai une seconde chance un midi (à peu près moitié prix) aux grillades/terriyaki. N'empêche que c'était une belle soirée d'amoureux!

Gros plus plus, on a apporté notre vin et notre saké."}
{"text":"Nouvelle découverte...

Commençons par l'accueil qui était parfait et le temps de réponse rapide. Le menu du midi est varié (un peu limité) et 1/2 prix le midi. La qualité (nourriture) très bonne et les qualités adéquates. On vous laisse parler sans vous importuner pour quitter la place. Restaurant qui attire les gens d'Affaires du coin et apporter votre vin.

Petit bémol... Les fauteuils sont un peu mous et j'ai vu beaucoup de clients demander des coussins pour améliorer le confort (ne pas vous gêner). Le décor est charmant et les toilettes particulières.  Au deuxième étage on peu accueillir des groupes."}
{"text":"The inside of Kyomi is absolutely breathtaking! The décor  definitely leaves an impact on the ambiance. There's private parking as well, a plus! 
I had went for lunch - not too crowded, service was on point. Their menu offers a variety of choices for lunch at good prices. We tried the sizzling chicken and the grill beef & chicken with salad. We also had a side of soup and imperial roll. The roll was served a bit hard.. The rest of the food was great! I highly recommend the grilled beef & chicken, and the sizzling chicken.
At the end, we ordered a chocolate mousse... it was disappointing because it was so small compared to the cost ($6.50$), and nothing was special about it... not worth it. Perhaps not the best place for desserts. 
Overall, I would actually go again, but this time for dinner instead where there is a much wider variety of dishes available. Also, it's a decent place to celebrate with friends and family or even bring a date! I would recommend Kyomi!"}
{"text":"Wow 3e fois que hame vais chez kyomi jamais déçus 

Nous étions 4 personnes un mercredi soir 
Belle et grande salle de 2 étages 
Service impeccable le serveur toujours présent quand on a besoin de quelque chose 

Ses un apporte votre vin
