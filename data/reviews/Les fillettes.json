{"text":"I was soo excited for this place but it was not what I was expecting... food was good, prices ok, terrasse awesome but service... come on. Way too long. Not sure if they were short on staff, the place was not full but we had to wait for menus, drinks, food, bill... i even missed my cab..."}
{"text":"I came with a party of 10 for a birthday. The menu was a bit confusing but we figured it out and only once we had decided what we all wanted to order individually, the waiter offered their set sharing menu. We would've clearly liked to choose this option but it was a little late. The service was very mediocre (not refilling the water, slow response, repeating ourselves, no ice for the white wine we ordered, etc.) - an overall \"chill\" attitude from the staff but maybe that's what they're trying for? I'd say take away the white tablecloths and lower the prices in that case... ANYWAY. Long story short, the food was good and that's where the 4 stars come in. The brussel sprout entree and the mackerel entree were fantastic, layered with flavour. The smoked sturgeon (main) was strange and salty. The osso bucco was huge and good. The desserts were delicious too. The price is reasonable and I like how each dish is different in size, cute."}
{"text":"So here's a little update. I wish I could say just good things about this place because the staff is so nice and pleasant but this place badly need a manager. 

It is so disorganized, they lost our reservation then found it then were confused about it. We asked for a bigger table on the terrase (which made the terrase experience much more plaisant btw) they said no, we sat at small table, they changed their mind so we moved to the big table. They forgot us a long time, then they forgot our food. Food was cold. Loooong super long wait for the food, not very many people . Very slow service, they served an iced tea instead of a tea. Forgot our desserts. Up graded our lunch dessert to evening dessert choice to save the day, and that crème brûlée was amazing,

There's definitely a room to train and organized this place"}
{"text":"Service impeccable et nourriture excellente. Table d'hôte du midi très abordable.
L'entrée,  Céleri-rave, anchoyade au citron, était légère, parfumée.  Le boudin servi avec
feuilleté à la confiture d'oignons, salade de champignons, roquette & cheddar fort tait parfait. Les portions sont généreuses et la table d'hôte n'est vraiment pas chère.

Le personnel est attentif, connait leurs produits. Vraiment impressionnée"}
{"text":"J'ai beaucoup aimé ce resto où nous avons été entres copines dans le cadre de Mtl à table.
L'endroit est beau de l'extérieur, et nous avons été bien accueillies, puis très bien servies durant toute la soirée.
Au niveau de la bouffe, j'ai adoré le velouté de courge musqué avec du porc effiloché il me semble, c'était un vrai régal. Ensuite, j'ai pris du foie de veau, moi qui adore ça, et il était réussi aussi, et bien accompagné. Enfin, nous avons craqué pour la tartelette fine aux pommes, qui était très bonne et venait accompagnée d'une mousse à l'érable délicieuse. Mon amie a pris la ganache au chocolat et elle avait l'air très bonne aussi!
Pour un menu à 31$, ça valait vraiment la peine!
J'y retournerai certainement, surtout que j'ai entendu dire qu'il y avait une terrasse l'été! :)"}
{"text":"Service approximatif et lent quoique souriant. Gérant un peu agressif a refusé l'accès a la terrasse pour notre groupe de 8. L'onglet commandé a été servi cru et a dû être retourné pour deux convives a notre table. Un peu cher pour une prestation inégale et somme toute très moyenne."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and very friendly staff.  Brunch was served cold, lacking taste and overpriced.    There is some creativity in the dishes so the place has potential, but I feel the food preparation and servings need to be greatly improved in order to match the"}
{"text":"Pros: pleasant atmosphere, pleasant service, tasty food.
Cons: bad value, slow service

The food was quite tasty, but the portions were very stingy for the price:

Salmon - tiny filet (half of what one would expect)
Ravioli - just one piece. That's a raviolo!
Bread - never offered; had to ask for it

Wine. If you go as a couple, they will offer you their signature \"Fillettes\", which they present as a bottle for two people. 
 
\"Fillettes\" = 250 ml = 1.4 standard glasses
Price: $20

For comparison:
Standard glass = 175ml.
Standard price: $10
 
Based on the price of 1 standard glass, a \"Fillettes\" should cost $14, but instead they charge $20.
 
So that's an extra $6 (42%) margin on the volume alone. Rip-off."}
{"text":"Nous avons adoré notre passage à ce restaurant. Tout était parfait, du service aux assiettes"}
{"text":"I've had 2 wonderful meals at Les Filettes. The first was a Saturday night and we went there after the reviews came out in the Gazette. We were told the terasse was full but after 5 minutes they gave us a table outside. We found the prices very reasonable and I loved the food. First the butter! It casts a couple of dollars but it was amazing (hazelnut and sea salt I think). I had the liver which was cooked perfectly and my husband had the salmon which had a wonderfully crisp skin and the corn sauce was amazing. A friend had the pasta and was underwhelmed but why eat Italian food at a French restaurant?!
The second time was for a ladies lunch(!) and again, great service and my food was delicious. 3 courses for $21 and that included hangar steak. Other dishes were even cheaper.
We're not big wine drinkers but service was excellent, very friendly and they weren't upset that we weren't drinking much. 
I'm looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with my sister for brunch. Both waiters working that day were extremely pleasant, and it wasn't crowded at all, probably because it was raining a bit that day. They have a nice open room that's clean with classy decor, a cute terrasse and a private room that you can rent for special events. A few people were enjoying their brunch outside while we decided to stay inside because of the weather. We had the entire room for ourselves. We ordered some coffee which we didn't enjoy much as the acidity was too strong. I ordered the smoked salmon, based on the waitress's recommendation since it's homemade. A few pieces of them were served with a mix of greens, a hard boiled egg, some slices of yellow and red beets pre-cooked (although not cooked enough as they were hard and dry) and few pieces of pumpernickel which was definitely stale because they were so dry and hard. It barely took five minutes to get my plate. I understand everything was already pre-made except boiling the egg but it's still unacceptable to serve such a plate with so many things not tasting fresh. I was really disappointed since we were pretty excited to try this place. It's unfortunate because the place looks nice. I will probably give it a second try someday.

Also, they have a few places for parking, so you might want to check the parking lot before parking your car somewhere else."}
{"text":"the food is ok, and the price value is pretty good, but I found the service a little slow, especially since we were a small group. I wish there were more vegetables in the main course, but they are usually found on the side dishes. Unfortunately, the side dishes were brought out first and by the time we received the main course, we had already finished our side dishes. Overall, this is a nice casual place to catch up with friends. We were seated inside, but the terrace outside looked really nice."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love Les Fillettes, so much so that I will give it another try sometime, but I have to give it 2 stars after my dining experience today at lunch.

First of all, the good about this place: the staff is attentive and really knows their wine list/pairings. The half liter option for wine is nice and it comes in a classy, plain bottle. They've got quite the range and the prices were pretty good as well; Second, the staff is positively lovely. Our server changed mid-service, unannounced, for some reason even though the place wasn't even busy, but both were great. Third and last, the place itself. The renovations inside are fantastic and this terrasse is truly a hidden gem of a terrasse: leafy, shaded and quiet even though this restaurant is located right on the busy Van Horne.

OK, so the bad: the food was bland and not especially edible. Started off with the milk and cauliflower soup as a starter; it was a cold soup and quite refreshing, but it was so bland and really needed something else to kick it up a notch. For the main, we both had their take on calamari. I quite like it when calamari isn't fried, so when it arrived on a bed of lentils and veggies and with no batter in sight, I was happy, but it looked like a stuffed, pink slug, not very appetizing looking. I tucked into my dish and although it wasn't the worst thing I've ever tasted, it was bad, both my lunch mate and I left at least half of the food on our plates (if you know me, you know that this isn't normal!) The table beside us ordered steak and they returned their lunch back to the kitchen, so I know that it wasn't just our dish that was off today.

The dessert was equally bland, it was a cherry clafoutis served in a cute round, shallow dish. It looked so pretty, but the consistency was mushy and it tasted like nothing.

The terrasse, the wine and the cold mint drink that came with dessert were the best parts of this whole experience and I want to like this place as it's so hip and friendly and has a fantabulous terrasse, but they are going to need to work on the food, especially in a city like ours and for the price that they are charging as well."}
