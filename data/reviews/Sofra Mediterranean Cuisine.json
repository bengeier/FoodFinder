{"text":"I've had Sofra numerous times and often have our work events catered by them. After my most recent experience I definitely will not be returning. I went to order takeout and order 5 meals. The waitress was rude and made it seem as though we were inconveniencing her. Even though we asked for all the meals to be packaged separately they were all packaged together. I ordered 3 chicken kabob dinners and the amount of chicken in the container looked to be less than the amount you get in 2 dinners.   It's a shame because this was the first time some of the people in my party had Sofra and they left with a horrible impression"}
{"text":"The food has no flavour. Just basic salt and pepper. I would not eat here again. Have been to the restaurant 5 times."}
{"text":"Decent dine-in experience and while we did enjoy our dinners it was overpriced compared to other similar choices for nearly identical fare in the area."}
{"text":"Love the naan as its hot, buttered cheesy goodness. Salads are smaller than I expected but still awesome and fresh. I brought my extended family there and it's now part of our go to places.  Service and food are excellent.  Dark chicken kebab dinner and lamb kebab dinners are our faves. So full by the end of our meal...  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Rudest person working in customer service!!! I've never been so offended from someone trying to sell me food. I ask what kind of side options I can change, she said \"I feel sorry for your mother\". I choose the food, and already start making payment as she asked \"are you married?\" I say no and she said \"Don't get married\". I cancel my order and leave. You will not get $15 being the rudest person, I have a sense of humor but this is too much. She had a straight face the whole time and no one was laughing. Never coming again and I recommend that you do not either. My friend had got food poisoning from there before."}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience I have ever had. The food was terrible and the owner was eating while talking to the customers and interrupting while we were eating to ask why I and the person eating behind me didn't order a drink. I told them I didn't like the thing she SUGGESTED and she said she can't do anything about it?! Terrible experience and food. DO NOT go here if you want to enjoy your dining experience."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, sectioned off eating areas provide good privacy in most areas. Appatizers are To Die For!! We've found that the food is hit and miss, with the garlic used on mains sometimes extremely overwhelming.  But when it's good, it's great! The prices are reasonable. Service is good. The salmon is our favorite. Definitely worth a try, may turn into a favour spot. Make sure you try the grilled eggplant Appatizers,  it's the best!"}
{"text":"Was looking to get a quick dinner and wanted to try it as it was relatively new to the neighbourhood. The place itself is small and has a few tables, comfortably fitting a few pairs and maybe 1 or 2 groups of 4. No full menu on the walls but they had stacks of printed ones to look through.   I ordered 2 chicken dinners and a salad and paid. There was 1 other person there and they ordered as well. I expected the order to be maybe 5-10 minutes, it was only 2 entrees and most of the food should have been just reheat (meat). After a 15 minute wait, I asked how much long, was quickly told just a few more minutes and dismissed.   The cashiers/front staff seemed to care more about chatting and taking their time restocking. One of them asked the other if they just help the kitchen staff and the other said they weren't paid to do so.  Both I and the other customer ended up with our meals more than 25+ minutes later. The service, speed, and attitude of the staff was absolutely disappointing. To be fair, one customer that came in got their sandwich right away. In terms of food, my wife enjoyed their chicken (I thought it was average), and the rest was mediocre.   Considering the price we paid ($40+) I expected much more. I will not be returning and don't recommend Sofra unless you don't have any other choice in the area and are willing to wait / deal with any poor service."}
{"text":"Nice place... Limited menu choices, the available choices are very good. Sofra offers excellent portion sizes and very tasty food. I like the appetizer choices, 4 appetizers with laffa is more than enough food for a couple."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone and this is the 2nd time I got home and my order is incorrect and I had to go back. One star because the owner didn't even apologize, he just said keep repeating the order until they get it. Food is mediocre but the location was convenient. However, I'll be making the extra drive to Hanna Shawarma or Mi Va Mi."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. When I go somewhere to eat, while I don't always expect excellent service, I do expect decent service. They make you feel like you have to pay to get a smile, same for the manager. The service here is bad 95% of the time, but last time was the last straw. I didn't choose to eat there to have my evening spoiled and leave with a bitter taste to the point I even regretted going there. It's too bad that they have chosen to treat customers like they had no competitors, with all the other restaurants around, I will never go back and give my business to a place that doesn't know how to treat customers with respect. I'm glad I will no longer have to put up with their attitude."}
{"text":"The prices may high but the large portions make up for it. The food is delicious. Possibly the best fast food middle eastern in the area. This is saying a lot because there are many schwarma places in the area.  The service, while friendly, is very slow. Try delivery if possible to avoid the long wait.   Recommend: anything in the laffa.  Avoid: ordering take out. It's just too slow. Get it delivered!"}
{"text":"As a regular customer for years of the Sofra in Thornhill I was excited when this location opened. Sadly it doesn't compare. I always get the Chicken Shawarma and the one at this location doesn't taste good. The toppings although are the same also taste different and bland. The chicken has  consitantly tasted off. The customer service is also horrific. I have given this location three chances and every time I get attitude of some sort from one of the staff. They are SO stingy with the toppings in comparison to the other location."}
{"text":"I like to give restaurants 2 chances before righting them off. This has to be the worst breakfast experience EVER!!    The home fries were saturated in oil and were an off putting dark brown. It's obvious the the oil needed to changed. I got the eggs Benedict with Pemeal bacon. The bacon was off and even after letting our waitress know our bill did not reflect the complaint. The hollandaise was a translucent yellow, nothing close to the rich creaminess that it should be.  Have to say I would never EVER return to Sofra for breakfast. The taste, and presentation were a disappointment. Save your money and go to Sunset Grill."}
{"text":"I have been dinning at this restaurant since day one they opened, I am glad they open this location, we used to drive to Bathurst and Rutherford for this style of food( Me Va Me or Henna's Shawarma). The food is amazing, very fresh, testy. They serve the best appetizers, love the Laffa bread. Their prices are very reasonable , I don't know how they do it. Very nice place to take family,friends or clients out for dinner or lunch. We always had good experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Sofra is now a statistic - closed, according to the sign, \"due to circumstances beyond our control\"."}
{"text":"Food is very good however the service was extremely  slow. They take your cutlery after  salad and don't replenish. Had to get up myself to get it. Waitress was nice but obviously  had too many tables. They gave buttons on the table for service but takes forever to respond.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"The one star is completely only for the service (waitresses are really nice), food is not fresh at all!! The duffer location is much more decent."}
{"text":"This place has some good food, everything is fresh and nice but they are over priced AND charge you a lot.  They were out of pita so they offered laffa, which is great but at this point they shouldn't be charging for the laffa ($1.50 extra!)  Beer bottle is $7... Wtf!!  Meal for one person including an alcoholic beverage is $18!! Yep... Just that stupid expensive.   I like the food but not when a shawarma is $11!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken souvalaki wrap and was pretty disappointed. While eating it, I bit on something hard. I spat it out and it looked like it was deep fried chicken skin or something nasty like that A few bites later there was bit of bone. Definitely not worth the $7+ I paid and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I decided to splurge and order salmon filet. Rubbery and chewey for 20$ and fishy too. The take out counter was not too busy but the server seemed impatient and not very helpful. She was then rude to another staff quite loudly and in front of customers. I will skip this joint."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick. Each table comes with a button to call the server if you need them to come by for water/bill/etc.   Food comes out fresh and delicious. The portions are fairly large.   The ambiance is nice. Slightly dimmed lights and nice music playing. Not a high end place, but still nice."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shwarma pita and one of the ladies charged me for a laffa which cost me extra. When the lady asked me what I wanted on my shwarma I told her I wanted \"Tahini\" but she instead put tatziki. The laffa was not rolled properly and fell apart instantly. Overall not satisfied and will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service for take out is incredibly slow. There are no patrons in the restaurant and I have been waiting for my chicken pita for 10+ minutes ! Unbelievable. 4 staff here and nobody has even made eye contact. Food is average."}
{"text":"It's been a few months and a few more visits to Sofra and I have to upgrade my previous review. The service really has improved markedly since my first few visits. The staff are very pleasant and very quick. They've got this neat button system to page your server for certain things. More water, the bill, etc.  Either the quality of the food has improved as well, or I was just ordering the wrong thing the whole time! The chicken shawarma is delicious, but even better in the laffe bread. The portion is massive.... And I mean eat half now and eat the other half later kind of massive. I usually go with the soup and sandwich deal because the chicken lentil soup is absolutely killer.   This place is quickly becoming a favourite in Richmond Hill....and I only live 5 minutes away....muHAHAHAHA."}
{"text":"I only put a star because you have to in order to write a post.   I ordered the 2 chicken skewer dinner which was over $18 after taxes and asked for tzatzeki which then the cashier told me was extra. I was very surprised as I have never paid for tzatzeki in a restaurant in all my life anywhere on this planet.   The food was then brought to my table by an older lady with VERY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, I then asked why they charge for tzatzeki after I just spent almost $20 for a dinner and she replied that this is Sofra and you have to pay $1.99 for tzatzeki if you want it. I mentioned to her that I have never payed for tzatzeki in any restaurant which then set her off. She started yelling at me and saying \"too bad you have to pay for it if you want. \" She then took my taheene sauce and slammed it on the table and said here is sauce if you want it, then turned her back on me and stormed back inside.   Long story short, I went back inside to try to get my money back because at this point I lost my appetite and have never had anyone speak to me the way she did especially a restaurant. She continued yelling inside and said she already made it.    I left out several details of the war she created over tzatzeki and I didn't eat the dinner in the end. The fries that were served with the dinner were also generic shoestring fries you get at your local supermarket.   My summary of Sofra is that it's a F grade knockoff of Me VaMe and doesn't come close to the quality, service or experience of MeVa. Please do yourself a favour and don't throw your money away at this location.  With no apparent experience in the food I will absolutely be blown away if they stay in business with this lady in charge."}
{"text":"The lady at the cash has an attitude that she is dong you a favour.   Already expensive prices where shawarma sandwich costs $10 then adds insult by asking for additional $2.00 to add babaganoush to sandwich. I understand $1, but this was something she just made up and pocketed - tax free.   The food was like any other joint in the area. Was starved after finishing a workout, so maybe that made it taste better.    Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So seems like the lady (owner/manager) who works here is kind of a b*tch. But the food is good. So if you can order quickly and you don't mind her snide remarks then this place is A-ok for you!   First thing I noticed is that this location is small!!! There's three small tables inside and maybe 6 tables outside in their \"patio\" area. The inside is always packed with people so not a good place to have your food peacefully. There's no menu anywhere on the wall, which was what I expected when I walked in. You can just grab one of those take out pamphlets from the basket on the counter. Nothing is explained, don't ask questions, if you hold up the line she will be pissed. I don't really know what's the rush to get all the orders in quickly, they couldn't even make the food fast enough. When my hubs was ordering his chicken skewers, she asked pita or laffa. And she wasn't impressed with how long he was thinking so she proceeded to do another task and when she came back he said pita. Then she asked whole wheat or white, and he was thinking again. She was clearly not impressed, and she said it's not that difficult. When I ordered she asked what side you want? Veggie. Salad? House. Pita or laffa? I said laffa. And she said that's how I like it. My hubs was not impressed, he was pissed!   Whatever they were doing, they weren't doing it right. She was constantly yelling at her employees. There were obvious communication issues. They were slow and kept getting things wrong. Everyone was not happy in there, especially the customers. I think the chef back there was about to throw down his apron. At the end even though I had ordered laffa she gave me pita in the take out bag. If she had actually gotten my order right maybe I would have given her an extra star. I like all the sauces they have here, the veggies and pitas are fresh, but the chicken shawarma was so dry some of the pieces were so hard I couldn't bite it. The food is good, which is why I think people keep coming back but they definitely to streamline their processes and change the way they communicate in order for them to survive. And as the boss lady repeatedly said during the time we were inside, They ARe Not associated with the other Sofra Grills!!!"}
{"text":"I have over a 100 reviews and this is only the 2nd time I will give a location a 1 star. TBH- i feel guilty as it is a small ownership company and this review might hurt their business.  Yet, I have gone against a lot of yelpers before and found out the hard way- So it is my duty to warn others about this place. I ordered 2 sandwiches + soup combo's and 2 bottles of water plus a small eggplant salad for delivery and the total came up to $43 dollars.  They told me toppings were free but ended up adding charges to my pita's. They charged me for AVIAN water at like $3 each. Sent me 2 NESTLE waters instead.  The food was good, but the bait and switch for people who dont have vehicles and have to resort to ordering was pretty WACK! Stay away from sketchy people. I feel people in the food industry should serve with love and care- instead of just making it for the money.  Shameful business ethics! (with known establishments like Me Va Me , Mr Combo, Belle , even shawarma Max around the corner) At least justify us paying super high prices for your product!  Edit: the owner did get in contact with me after the review and offer to reconcile the issue. However even with high quality food, there was a bad taste in my mouth. I am still on the fence about ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We've called in a take out from Sofra twice now.   For starters we have had the babaganoush and the falafel. The baba is fantastic, creamy and smokey and full of flavour. Unfortunately the pitas were not so great. The falafel was also nice, not dry and had good taste.   On the entree side, we've had the chicken kabob, lamb kabob, and the sea bass (grilled). All three were cooked to perfection and had clean flavour. The sides are also yummy - love the red potato 'wedges'.   They are a little expensive though - a starter and two entrees are about $50.   The service is trying but they seem like they are always understaffed. They buzz around trying to get things done quickly but unfortunately the overall \"service\" lacks because there are just too many things to do."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered a chicken shawarma laffa and my friend ordered a lamb kefta laffa (Laffa = Mediterranean wrap). They use house made saj bread for their laffa which is pretty awesome. You get to top your laffa the way you like subway style but with Mediterranean toppings like taboli, hummus, babaganooj, tahini sauce etc. More toppings than what you find at most shawarma places.  Portions are very generous. Laffas are wrapped in foil and are nicely presented on a plate. The chicken blends nicely with the toppings and the bread to create a juicy, great tasting laffa. Prices are reasonable. Free WiFi. Service was friendly even though we came half an hour before closing time.  I am not sure why all the negative reviews. Next time I will try ordering something different. For now I strongly recommend the chicken shawarma laffa."}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars, very good. Service is rather slow and the place is very cramped. I guess they need to extend space."}
{"text":"The lady on the phone was rude and argumentative when I tried to clarify an order.  I like the food so will continue to order it, but jeez, clean up your customer service and stop telling customers they are wrong.  Maybe this is why Sofra separated themselves from this location/operation."}
{"text":"Went here with the family and I had to say, the food varied greatly in quality. I had the artichoke salad which was ridiculously sour to the point where I couldn't finish it. The falafel and fries were average.   The chicken kabobs were great though. So was the appetizer tray (with the samosas and Moroccan cigars). Everyone at the table ordered a different dish and it was either they didn't like it, or they did.  The customer service was great however. The restaurant had friendly and prompt staff, plus they had buttons which you could specifically call for either service, more water, or the bill which cut out the waiting by a lot."}
{"text":"Even though the food is ok, the service is terrible. We came here with our family and kids and we're just not sure about some items in the menu. Upon question, the server was just giving us a blank stare and short \"I'm annoyed\" answers to a point I had to apologize for my lack of understanding of some dishes. That made the whole experience horrible. Also most of the food is soaked in oil."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and very good. I usually order the Chicken kebabs with rice (which is delicious) as well as the red cabbage slaw and hummus. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price... it IS a little pricier than comparable cuisines in the area."}
{"text":"If you want authentic heart of the middle east flare, with the edge of the region, then Sofra uptown is a great place to grab take out, or dine in.   Small yes, but as the old saying goes... \"you pay for what you get\"    the quality of the food is top notch.   I have been a customer of Sofra I  thornhill, and now thrilled it's in the hood.   I have read some of the past reviews... Food has never been an issue.... And the service,it's fun  ... Well I enjoyed it and will return often.."}
{"text":"If you want easy, no-frills Mediterranean food, this is your spot. It's tiny--like 4 tables inside tiny, but there's a larger covered patio, weather permitting.   The woman who owns (or runs) this place is a gem. I can go months without coming here and she remembers me the minute I walk in and knows my order better than I do. All the employees are nice and helpful so I'm confused by the bad reviews.  I mean MAYBE the owner is a bit pushy, but when she's pushing exactly what I like to eat at me without me having to think (or worry about things being vegan) why wouldn't I like that?  You order at the cash register and they bring the food to your table. I get the Greek Salad with no cheese and the 4 combo plate ( hummus/cole slaw/eggplant/tabouli (with sides of tahini and spicy sauce). Their portions are generous and pricing is average to slightly higher than average.   My companions got the falafel combo, beef kabobs with fries and the lamb sandwich and they all enjoyed their meals very much.  Or at least I assume they did. I was busy eating. Who has time to listen.  Street parking is available and there is a lot behind the restaurant as well. (a pay lot)  Good food with quick service. Ignore the haters."}
{"text":"After coming here today to get some take-out with a no-fuss experience, I decided that a review was long due for Sofra.  It was a friend who mentioned about his meal experience here and then took me along one chilly evening in July. My first dining experience here was satisfactory and the owner who had a rather practical personality was quite hospitable to the point where she was able to accommodate a family of five who was not certain about the seating arrangements for their table. I also remember her going around to each party that was there and striking up a conversation also checking on the customers about their meal experience. Overall, there was a homely atmosphere at this restaurant.  The meals that my friend and I had were just as scrumptious as they look in the pictures. I had the chicken skewer and steel spear that was used to cook the chicken pieces was a first for me, never seen anything like that when dining in at other Middle-eastern style eateries. The salad was so fresh and lettuce was crisp and the cherry tomatoes were firm to the bite. The flatbread that we had, called a Laffa which looked like the Middle-eastern version of Naan bread was warm and soft which was a good thing because it's been a very long time since I've had a flatbread of that quality. Just look a the picture of it! I am also a big potato lover and was not disappointed with the herb infused garlicky flavor of their potato dish. I took half of the meal home and it was just as tasty after being heated in the microwave the next day.  During a subway ride today, I wanted to get some take-out around North York Centre and decided to return here for a second time. I picked the first option for the Lunch Specials which was the $10 deal: a meat dish + a side + three choices of their cold appetizers. I think I chose the chicken donair and of course the garlic potatoes. The food was shaken up a bit in the take-out bag but it still looks appetizing enough. I got here around 1:30pm and it wasn't busy and customer service was friendly enough and my order was prepared and packed in good enough time.  Alright so I had half of my take-out earlier for dinner and I will say that chicken was a bit dry since it was the shaved meat used for the donairs and sharwama. he meat for the skewers are more moist in texture. Since I didn't get a laffa, I had to use a slice of bread which I stacked with some of the meat and appetizers. The garlic potatoes tasted the same as before. Out of the three appetizers the tabouleh stood out and had a refreshing taste to it. I also liked the hummus with the sharp taste of the tahini. The taste of the grilled eggplant which was alredy pureed was lost in the flavors of the tabouleh and the tahini. Word to self: next time handle our take-out with care.  The dining area here is small which means that customers can't really \"loiter\" around during their meal, even though the patio in the summer allows for more sit-down dining experience. As someone who would prefer to get take-out and eat this back at home which is very comforting, I would come here whenever I crave for cuisine from this region of the world.  And as far as Sharwama and Kebab restaurants in that area are concerned, Kofra does stand out."}
{"text":"Second time we've had Sofra for delivery and the food has impressed both times!  The meats are great (steak, lamb kafta and two types of chicken).  The hummus/tahini/baba Ganoush platter with the mushrooms were so good.  Will highly recommend especially if you're catering a get together at your place.  Also, the lady/owner was very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I used to order here often but i moved away from the area. I came back to visit family this week and ordered takeout. My total came to $25 which isn't bad as i remembered their portions being pretty decent. I OPENED MY ORDER AND MY LAMB SKEWER PEICES WERE SMALLER THAN HALF MY THUMB. And i only got 5 pieces which is ridiculous. When i called to ask whether this was normal they were extremely rude.   By the way i live only 5 mins away (2 intersections) and delivery minimum is $45 (more when its busy $50+).  This was one of my favourite restaurants in richmond hill... Not anymore though."}
{"text":"Well let's start with ordering on the phone ... The girl who answered was def not who I saw ... The girl who took my order was a sweetheart but walking into the place I wasn't greeted and there was woman who looked like a body guard who was rude took my money and all the while being on her cell ! Rude!  However the food was good tasted great !  Not sure if I will go back to this location but maybe try another location one more time ."}
{"text":"I had no idea they had a Richmond Hill location, but I am so happy they expanded from their Thornhill location.  We ordered the Chicken Kabob dinner and the and Trout. Both were juicy and flavorful. The wait time was minimal, and the service was great. Its my new favorite."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, but often find the experience and food quality to be inconsistent.  Sometimes the food is fantastic and other times not so great.  I would also rate the service below par as they aren't very helpful and often come across as a bit rude.  They do a terrific job on their marketing as we always get stuff in the mail promoting this place.  The decor of the restaurant is great, but overall the stuff that matters is lacking.  The reason you go back to a restaurant is for the food and service and without it very few last.  This place is fairly new so maybe it's growing pains.  I'll give them a couple more chances before writing them off."}
{"text":"It was much better before, but I noticed the quality of food was declining while the price of food was increasing. It would be a good idea if try to out compete their competitors who also offer Mediterranean cuisine by atleast lowering the price since the options aren't as many as well as the quality and service."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, there weren't any customers other than us. They had a table set up for a photo shoot for their menu, which seemed to be the only thing the owner and the employees cared about. Not their only paying customers for lunch. We ordered the Kefta lunch combo and a falafel pita sandwich. We waited around 8 minutes for our food, while we watched another customer come in, buy a sharwama sandwich and leave within 1 minute. I was a bit upset because I've been to plenty of sharwama restaurants around the city and I usually get my food a lot faster than 8 minutes. Even though 8 minutes may not sound long to you, but all I saw were the employees standing around, chit-chatting, and asking their photographer what else they needed. Once I got the food, the owner came out and explained to me why the food was taking so long. \"We cooked the lamb fresh when the customer comes in. You don't want fresh food?\" That was a bit condenscing with attitude. Anyways, the girl who filled my falafel sandwich took no time to explain what some of the other sauces/toppings were (I'm not THAT familiar with shawarmas). I was a bit bothered by that, especially when I had to ask them twice how long the food was going to take.   The food was meh. The lamb kefta (which the lady owner so emphatically emphasized that it was freshly cooked) was moist but completely bland. The rice side was very little in portion and the salad was plain boring. This for $11. My falafel sandwich was alright, but small for what I'm used to at other shawarma places in the area. The falafels were cooked well but quite small. The ingredients seemed fresh. The hummus was nothing to brag about.   Another thing that bothered me was a dad and his son came in and looked at the menu and left the store. The lady owner loudly commented, \"How rude\". So, I guess, customers aren't allowed to walk in, peruse the menu and decide to leave? Wow.   So if you want mediocre food with rude service, then by all means, try Sofra!"}
{"text":"Last night we went for dinner with another couple.  They had a promotions where you received 3 dips (salad combination) for free to start your meal.  We ordered hummus, green eggplant, and babaganoush.  The dips were good and the bread was fantastic.  The hummus was good but I have to say it isn't as good as some of the other local places.   We tried the chicken shishkabob, halloumi salad, chicken schnitzel, shrimp on a skewer, and the fish and chips.  All the main courses were fresh and hot.   The food was very flavourful and served promptly.  I found the food to be quite a bit more expensive than the standard places in Thornhill.  My husband was charged 16.00 for a skewer with 6 shrimp on it.    We both found that the food didn't sit well with us last night and we had some indigestion after  - to be frank indigestion isn't something I experience when I go out to eat so I found it strange.  The location is convenient but I would likely drive 10 km south and go to either Me-Va-Me, Orly's or Hannah's.  On a plus side - the restaurant has been nicely designed and decorated it's beautiful."}
{"text":"After 2 visits I can honestly say I love this place. Whenever I crave for meat or fish they never disappoint. Service was pleasant as all experience ."}
{"text":"Good food. The laffa bread is delicious!! A must try restaurant. Good place to go for a quality meal."}
{"text":"The food looked and tasted great but we all were in the bathroom the rest of the night till the morning... Something was not clean or fresh... I have a strong stomach and rarely get sick from food when others do but this did me in big time... Never going back..."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Sofra. I used to live in Richmond Hill and saw this restaurant being built but never had a chance to eat here. I came to visit my boyfriend in Richmond Hill and he recommended us to eat here. From the outside the restaurant doesn't look like a great place to eat. However the internal decor is very modern. Once you enter the restaurant there's a takeout station. We seated ourselves. The tables at the restaurant are very private which I like. There's a buzzer at each table if you need the waitress for water, the bill or anything else. We ordered the baba gonoush dip to share and it came with unlimited helpings of fresh homemade laffata bread sooo yummy. When you ask for refills on the bread the server would give you attitude. She ended up not bring us the bread refill after we asked for it so we didn't ask again. Why offer unlimited bread when you get pissed off when the customer ask for it?! That's why one star was deducted from this restaurant. Other than the rude service. The food I have to say was amazing! The meat was tender and the chicken was super seasoned and juicy. When ordering the beef order medium. I ordered medium well and it came too well done. I would come back again but hope I get another wait staff that's not so rude. The lunch special was a bit pricey at$15-17 but the quality of food was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while passing through.  Fantastic sandwiches and salads, as well as great service. Located in a little shopping mall, this is a nicely decorated and comfy restaurant. Based on our lunch experience I'd say it's probably worth a return visit for dinner."}
{"text":"I tried the shish kabob combo today and the eggplant appetizer. It wasn't anything special for a meal that came up to almost $20. I'm not sure if the eggplant appetizer was supposed to be cold or they should have warmed it, but I didn't like it cold and it was very bland."}
{"text":"Very good consistent service and meals. Very generous portions, good sized house salad, nice light dressing but very tasty to start and the naan bread is awesome. For you starch sides the little red potatoes in garlic are a just have but you can do a split on your sides.like rice and potatoes or rice and fries.  This is great because the portions are big enough with the double skewer dinner to share between 2 adults. On an aside the shawarma is he first I ever had years ago and still my very favourite. Good lunch time menu. I have read the below reviews and one said safe menu.  The menu is not that simple and I dare say safe as what the cooks at Sofra do they do exceptionally well.  He cuts of meat are good the price and value are very good. I have catered for family events of 12 people in the lat and order one dinner per 2 people and it is more than enough.  Delivery is very reasonable.   Kid friendly restaurant.   Very, very busy on the weekends as it is a local favourite.  So get there early if you have kids to avoid the wait. For middle eastern food Sofra is my favourite hands down. New takeout Sofra at Yonge and Sheppard my sis says is just as good."}

{"text":"Swingged by the other day for a quick shawarma pita wrap before movie with bf.   The lady(I think she's the owner) was very nice and sweet.   Got chicken shawarma wrap so did my bf.  it tasted so good but too much oil made the pita soggy. And the pita fell apart by the end. So much sauces on the wrap, felt like I was having soup but that's the way I like it. Would be better if the sauces went evenly.   Bit too pricey tho."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 skewers beef shawarma dinner with potato wedges and house salad .  The beef was a bit chewy and potato wedges was a bit soft.    The house salad was good . Their homemade special salad sauce was unique and creamy .   Price was over $20 . It was just average .  Wasn't satisfied at the end ."}
