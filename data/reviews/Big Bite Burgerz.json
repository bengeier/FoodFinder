{"text":"It's a pretty good place! You get a lot for what you pay. 

 If you're hungry, definitely a place to go. The meat is homecooked and ingredients fresh. The space is clean too. The only thing is maybe the fries might be a bit too oily , but it's nothing really of concern, just less potato taste more oil taste. Personally it's hard on me to eat too much but it probably won't bother most people!"}
{"text":"I live in the hood & walk by it a lot. Finally decided to give it a shot.
It was OK. The fries weren't as cooked as I'd have liked and the oil didn't taste too clean. Maybe it's just my preference.
The home made burger was quite greasy & it had a bit of a gamey taste to it.
Bottom line, I'm not running back for more.
The service was also just OK. The owners seem really miserable."}
{"text":"Value meal comes to mind when I finished eating. In my experience, most fall into two groups mediocre inexpensive food or gourmet food for a good price(sometime over priced)


This one feel in first group. 10 buck for double patty burger,  patty felt like ,4 oz despite suppose to be 6 so that another point against them.

The patty itself was overcooked, too much char on it. There was no juice so it was favour less. Not the patty seem to have any seasoning or taste outside of slightly burnt taste. It was filling atleast

The restaurant itself could use a good cleaning it was disorder, need to be clean and look better. The bench and table i see where meh, kind of just grab and used.

I saw no major issue with food preparation, no gloves or hairnet for two women who run it but nothing seem to be handdle by hand.

The washroom downstairs and that downstairs area was disgusting. Washroom was dirty and out of supply no soap or paper towels."}
