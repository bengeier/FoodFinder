{"text":"Ordered Bread sticks and Buffalo Mild wings. The food itself was very delicious! I just felt awful because after ordering, the app (Eat24) got in contact with the restaurant to find out the orders status...20 minutes after I put it in apparently. Had no idea, so was very surprised when the delivery man responded with \"Impatient aren't we?\" When I answered the door. Definitely understand the annoyance, 20 minutes isn't long enough to have anything cooked. From now on if I order with them I'm attaching a disclaimer note that if they're prompted for an update, it's not me and they should take their time. Very embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Pizza Burgh quite a few times now & have to say it is my favorite go to pizza place. Their pizza is very good, perfect crust & sauce with fresh toppings. I've had their Italian hoagie & wings which were also good. Delivery is either quicker than or on time to what they say it will be. I will continue to order from here."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad, turkey hoagie, and children's chicken strips meal. Everything was good, nothing to rant and rave about but I ordered through the eat24 app, food came quickly (despite the snowy day) and it was good."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their hoagies...cheeseburger hoagie was scary - mystery meat...,chicken parm hoagie was a soggy bland mess....maybe try the pizza next time??"}
{"text":"Really great pizza, their staff came through in a pinch and baked a dozen pies for the crew we had working a train derailment in Mckeesport. 20 plus hungry men had nothing but compliments on the quality Thanks"}
{"text":"Their specialty pizzas are really good, and their subs are as well.  I've been trying different things from the menu for the last month.  I haven't order from anywhere else since the first time I ordered from them.  The only thing I didn't like so far was their wings."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  I cannot understand how there are any good reviews.  My wife and I ordered two buffalo chicken hoagies and mozzarella sticks.  The ranch dressing is awful and tastes store bought.  If you are a pizza place you should have good house made ranch.  The mozzarella sticks appeared to be oven baked which the menu does not specify.  This means they are not crunchy and have little flavor on top of that.  The buffalo chicken hoagie was quite possibly the absolute worst hoagie I have ever had in my life.  The chicken was a full breast and was extremely chewy and not cooked properly.  It was not edible.  If all of that wasn't enough, there were bones in the sandwich.  Not small bones either, ones that could easily cause someone to choke.  I was refunded for the sandwiches, which is the only good thing I have to say about this place."}
{"text":"They do not fry their appetizers, they're baked in the pizza oven I guess? Just not good quality. The thin and crispy pizza was good but around $15 for a medium 2 topping? Never again! Tried it twice thinking it was a fluke but no, this place sucks!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 hoagies, they were average, i ordered cheese fries with bacon, they were decent.  But the order of mushrooms were just aweful, they were not fried, and they tasted freezer burned, i will give there pizza a try.  But never again will i get anything else"}
{"text":"We ordered from the Munhall location and it was great. The Burgh box had a small Sicilian pizza, breadsticks and chicken tenders. Everything was so good my toddler even ate some of everything. I don't know about the McKeesport location but the munhall store earned a new customer tonight. Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"I've tried several things on the menu and none that great.  The pizza is just bland.  Didn't really see any sauce, a lot of crust, mainly just dough.  I've had a veggie hoagie and was ok.  Hard to mess up a veggie hoagie I just hated that the green peppers we're rings not cut in half like other places.  Don't know why but that bothers me.  They're breaded mushrooms were soggy.  Not crispy like everywhere else.   The only thing I really like is their hot cheese balls wish I found another place with those."}
{"text":"Litte shop in a small semi-deserted strip mall.   Nice indoor seating with a TV.  The pepperoni pizza we ordered had a off taste.  The sauce was plain and not one anyone seemed to really enjoy."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken parm hoggie and it was not good at all. I was the first and last time I will ever eat there."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, wings not bad either. Only downfall they quit delivering to my area so I stopped ordering from them. Good while it lasted!"}
