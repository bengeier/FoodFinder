{"text":"Holy cow, Athens' can really fit a LOT of food on a plate. That is, only order a gyros plate if you and your two friends are REALLY hungry. I was NOT that hungry, and carted 3/4 of my order home to my appreciative husband. The gyros themselves were pretty good, although I occasionally crunched down on a piece of not-quite-ground-up herb/spice that was a little off-putting. I'm fairly certain I've had better tzatziki sauce, though I'm not sure if it was Parthenon or that gyro joint I went to in Florida...  I digress. Food aside, I'm not a huge fan of eating inside a gas station. I had to suppress the urge to grab a bag of chips from the shelf right next to my table, and there were frequent walk-bys from customers on their way to the john.  I'd recommend hauling your two pounds of food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not the best. It's dry and the sauce isn't the best. You get a lot but it's real messy. I've had better but for a gas station it'll do when I'm craving it super bad!"}
{"text":"How did we live in Waunakee for a full year without finding this place?!?!   First of all, Google LIES when they say they aren't open anymore.  The food is just soooo good, and very reasonably priced. They've got tables outside, but we usually get ours to go. The meat is great, cooked rotisserie style (like it should be) and none of those punk ass heat and serve strips that some places call a gyro - seriously people, no.  Anyhow, you can do regular, loaded, eggplant, or plate. My favorite is to order a loaded gyro, but instead of adding extra meat, add eggplant. Yum! I also like that they use local veg while it is the season. I did get some pretty spicy greens once, but that just added to the experience.  They said they are moving to an indoor location for the fall, which I honestly hope is is downtown Waunakee so I can eat them everyday and get crazy fat, cause why not."}
{"text":"This IS the ONLY place in Madison to get a good gyro. Its in Trader Gus' gas station. (Shell)"}
{"text":"Not only are the gyros fantastic, my wife had the steak taco special and we have to admit the Greeks outdistanced Mexican restaurants on these--big chucks of real steak (not flank steak).  Delicious!  Also had the Greek salad. Everything very fresh and well prepared. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and even gave me a free soda but I'm pretty sure she did it because she saw how terrified I was to touch anything. There were cobwebs from the chandeliers, unidentified filth in every form on every surface, and caked on foods on nearly every visible food prep surface. I realize that sometimes the best food comes from the strangest hole-in-the-wall establishments but this wasn't one if them. I ordered a gyro meal (the woman couldn't pronounce correctly-should have been my second clue) and it was clear the meat was old, the tzatziki sauce was a pre-made frozen sauce that lacked any authenticity. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Gyros in a gas station...sounds naughty but actually they are surprisingly good. Every couple of months I hit the self destruct button and get a hankering for good mystery grub...stuff that falls into the Spam category. These are perfect for spontaneous spam night. I will return."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been a big fan for many years, and have always been extremely pleased with the Hospitality and Quality of the food. This was one of my go to places. That was however when Gus owned it. Gus has since retired, and it's a shame the new owners didn't learn anything from Gus, but if you ever met them you'll understand why. They're not restaurant people, and shouldn't be in the business. Not any of the former employees work there, and it's evident in their product. Don't make the mistake that I made. I picked up a Gyro plate, drove home, and was completely disgusted with the meal. It was absolutely horrible, and honestly I wouldn't have given it to my dog. The gyro meat was dried out and hard, the fries were old and cold, no onions accompanied my plate, the tomatoes were  non-existent, and the pitas were hard, and cold, and the proportions were 1/3 of what they use to be. The sad thing is the new ownership wouldn't accept constructive criticism, but then again I'm not surprised. My reccomendation, don't waste your time or money here when you can go right next door to Murphey's Naut-I-Gal or Willows. You'll be far more satisfied with both the presentation and quality of the food, proportions, and professionalism from people who have succeeded in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed today. I have eaten these gyros since the State Street days in the 80's. I ordered the gyro meal as you would expect: fries were barely warm & the gyro was like soup. I know gyros are sloppy anyway,  but the combination of mediocre fries and soupy gyros was a disappointment."}
{"text":"If you go to a Gyros restraunt you dont order anything else! That said, Gus managed Parthenons on State St for 100 or so years before breaking out on his own. He was the back bone of Parthenons and shows it with his extrodinary recipes for the best Gyros I have ever had. If its sit down you want drive to the location in Cross Plains, it also have some of the best Mirco brews available!"}
{"text":"Food truck on point in Wisconsin!!!  Yummy yummy yummy to my tummy. They have what looks like daily specials today was steak tacos which everyone was getting down with....must try.   For that gyro craving - get the classic gyro spice it up with some of their spice sauce and devour it!  The whole fam bam sat outside enjoyed the great food and left happy!    Try it bet you would go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, and when they get the employees trained sufficiently I look for the service to improve"}
{"text":"Athens Grille is now located in a food cart in the back of Gus's prior Shell station parking lot.  Their menu is modest and includes occasional specials, but what they do, they do very well. The traditional and chicken gyros are delicious and the fries are always crispy and pleasantly salted. The food is good value for the money, and the produce is locally sourced. Their summer tomatoes tasted like they had come right from the garden."}
{"text":"Athens grill is our new favorite restaurant. The food is consistently fresh, hot and beautifully prepared. The staff are warm, friendly and get along great with one another and genuinely like their customers. The venue is beautiful, flooded with sunlight and they play great music. The prices are affordable too. Bonus - they now have 1/2 price tap beer 3pm- 5pm and the beer selection is excellent. Thanks Athens Grill for being a Northside standout! Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"Fish fry at Athens Grill! Sorry I couldn't take the picture before I ate some of this delicious dinner! Lightly battered cod and wild caught perch. Great slaw/chopped salad. All really well prepared."}
{"text":"Gas Station Gyros...crazy right?  These gyros rock.  Don't even try to eat it in your car as you'll end up with a lap full of tzatziki sauce.  Hey is that tzatziki sauce on your pants or are you just happy to see me? Fries are fresh hand cut with the skins on.  They have other greek specialty items as well however once I smell that gyro meat roasting, I'm committed.  Love these gyros!!!"}
{"text":"While the gyros are great the rest of the menu is the best--extraordinary chicken wings, eggplant gyros and Athens fries--all top notch! Friendly staff and bright, modern space."}
{"text":"My go to lunch place at work. Classic Gyros are the best but I always tend to try their eggplant gyro. It is always cooked to perfection. They have opened a very spacious restaurant by the gas station which has the same setting as the old palace but much more space and drinks. The lunch is usually pretty crowded even with all this space but the service is fast and efficient. U will never be disappointed.   Just an inside tip- if you are taking gyro to go, it's always a good idea to get 2 gyro plate with some extra pita for 4. Their portions are so huge that u have always enough gyro in 2 plates for 4 pita."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Their new expanded menu makes them the best option in waunakee/Westport. Beyond the go-to gyro, the Carr Valley cheese curds, mac n cheese, and cheeseburger were outstanding.  Beyond this, the highlight was the eggplant pita-ammmmazing!"}
{"text":"Whoever said a gas station can't make the best gyro or Greek street food? apparently the have not stopped into Athens Gryro. Tucked inside the Shell gas station is a squeeky clean Greek grill that serves piping hot pitas with fresh chicken, grilled pork, or gryro meat with loads of fresh tomatoes, onions, and creamy cucumber sauce........ALL AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  This seriously is the best kept secret of all of Madison WI. I always order the grilled pork pita with all the fixings. You can watch the cook grill your pillowy bread and slice the onions and tomatoes in front of you. One time I witnessed him making the cucumber sauce, shredding fresh hot house cucmbers and combining them with fresh herbs in a cream yogurt sauce. The gas itself is pretty cool too. Nice wine selection and plenty of clean tables to eat your warm pita. Did I mention you could play the lottery or drink a cold brewsky at the bistro tablexs inside the station? yeah, that's an added bonus."}
{"text":"My wife is a gyros fiend and swears by this place. I love it too. I also love that it is in a gas station well fit for my low key demeanor(!) yet it is very clean, well lit, clean bathrooms, with friendly service and modest prices.  There are perhaps 8 to 10 nice tables and chairs either seating 2 or 4 guests.    You can also enjoy a beer with your meal. When I have been able to, they invited me to just go in the cooler and pick out what I liked from their wide selection. Fun!  Despite the availability of fermented malt  beverages, I have never seen anyone else have one or be at any level of intoxication.    Never any rowdy people or loud obnoxious jerks either.  Perhaps the crowd changes as the night wears on though.  But during lunch and regular dinner hours, definitely family friendly.   Also, I love their french fries.  Not thin strings or fat and mushy. Somewhere in the middle and just right.  Love it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in Wisconsin, perfect amount of meat to veggie! Mine was a little light on sauce, they gave me more without paying extra! Win win!"}
{"text":"Ah, the new restaurant is finally open and is very welcome on this side of town. The food is surprisingly good but some people still say it's not as good as the Gyros at blah, blah blah. Sure there are some differences but it is quite good and you get plenty to eat. This time I had their burger and fries. I can't remember why it was different but it was and very tasty. We got a side order of mac and cheese that was equally different and good. The small bar is nice and the bar keepers are young but knowledgeable on the beers and made a decent Manhatten for me. (Give me a break, I'm older and that's what I drink!) The food comes out very quickly so if you want to have a beer first and take your time don't order right away. The only complaint is that the lighting is way too bright; turn it down!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after work one day and got take-out and I was not impressed.  I got the chicken souvlaki and the meat was tough and the sandwich was loaded with onion, so much so that there really wasn't room for anything else.  They have a few small tables, but who wants to eat in a gas station?  The cucumber sauce was good, though."}
{"text":"I will preface this review with the fact that I am in no way knowledgeable (at all) about gyros.  In fact, I have maybe eaten less than a handful in my entire life.  But, I do know good food when I have it.  My husband and I visited the food truck just the other night and both got the classic lamb gyro with an order of fries.  The fries were fries and good, but the GYRO.  The lamb was so tender and flavorful and the ingredients, like others have said, seemed so incredibly fresh.  You know quality when you see actual red tomatoes on your food rather than pale pinkish-whitish ones.  Again, no expert here on pitas, but it was amazing and all together filling.  I really can't wait to visit again and try some of their other gyros.  What a hidden gem; I can't believe this food truck exists in the parking lot of a gas station.  And there were people in and out constantly while we sat near the truck and enjoyed our food.  Also helped that the guy taking orders was super energetic and just seemed to love life.  Looking forward to trying out their restaurant too!"}
{"text":"Disappointing customer service.  Have been getting take out since we moved to DeForest over a year ago and the food is very good. It's on my way home and we probably get food from there 3-4 times a month. Today I ordered two Athens Salads, two sides of gyro meat and two Tzatziki sauces.  I even asked Marilyn at the window for a little extra salad dressing because our salads were just a little dry the last time. She was happy to comply and when she handed me the bag, she told me the extra sauces were in the bag.  So after getting home, I pulled the food out of the bag and realized I had been given someone else's order.  No biggie...everyone makes mistakes. It was two chicken gyros and fries with feta and Tzatziki sauce on them. Disappointed, I called to let them know I had been given the wrong order. I was transfers to Adam, the manager. I explained what happened, and he told me they have a policy that customers need to check to make sure their order is correct before driving away.  As soon as he said that, I recalled seeing the sign.  He basically indicated they would not be a able to assist, and we ended the conversation. I had made the decision that we would not be going back, and they had lost a customer. My husband came home and I told him.  He decided to give them a call and give them another chance to make things right.  He spoke with Caitlyn. My husband was calm and professional, as was I.  Caitlyn told him that some of their customers were taking advantage of them, and that is why they had this policy.  Caitlyn told him she didn't want to lose him as a customer and asked what she could do for him. She agreed to give us the correct order the next time we were in, on the house.    So my question is, why didn't Adam handle it the same way as Caitlyn did? Is it because I'm a woman?  Plus, I feel like I was being treated like a criminal.  And, isn't it their employee's job to make sure the customer gets what they ordered and paid for??  After a busy day at work, I just wanted to enjoy a nice dinner and decompress. Instead I am having to post this review. Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm not sure we will ever return to, but I thought their customers should know how they treat some of their customers."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Gyro. Worth the trip from anywhere in the Madison area.  Always been a fan of Parthenon's but always a pain to get downtown. These are right up there with the convenience of being able to call ahead for drive up service or a quick 5 minute wait."}
{"text":"The gyros was very good,, however, we got the flakey spinach and feta thing and it was soggy not flakey at all.. Not bad but wasn't 5 stars like the reviews said.."}
{"text":"Well....the gyros served here are as good as they get.  What makes them good?  Everything tastes fresh and the gyros are made right.  There isn't too much of one ingredient overshadowing another.  This is a food truck right now as they wait for their restaurant to be finished next door.  One cool thing they have done is put a heated outdoor seating area next to the truck.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after a client raved about their gyros. She must not be the only one with this opinion, because it was very busy, and on a Monday night. The only mistake I made was ordering the dinner, instead of just the sandwich. The dinner comes with a GINORMOUS amount of meat(and fries). All this for less than nine bucks? Sweet! Next time, I'll just get the sandwich(less than six bucks)--my boyfriend and I both felt meated to the max.  I will definitely come back to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and beautiful new building. I took one star off for how loud the place is. Between staff and customers  moving and dragging chairs across the floor to people holding conversations with people two tables over had me gulping my food to get out of there."}
{"text":"Gas station gyros sounds like the kind of thing that will leave you filled with regret, however, these gyros will leave you filled only with a full tummy AND HAPPINESS!!  Let's work from the outside in:  The pitas are soft and fresh. They have a wonderful mouth feel to my mouth which likes soft and fresh bread products. It is also thrown on the griddle for a bit so that it slightly caramelizes. Okay, I don't know if it actually caramelizes but it does transform. The lamb is a wonderful flavor and shaved to exactly the right thickness. The tzatziki sauce is delightful, as well, though I wish it had more cucumber. It's then loaded with fresh onions and tomato slices. Perhaps too many onions.   Me and my tummy are happy we weren't too scared to try these gas station gyros."}
{"text":"You want a gyro.. You want a gyro burger.. You want a gyro platter?! Step right up folks and witness that that is the amazing gyro place in all Madison.  Their meat is superb, drinks are flowing and heavy, prices are perfect, and atmosphere is relaxed. My family and I go here once a month, snag our favorite table, and hang out.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great gyros,  excellent fries! The new building is now open and thriving!!! Could turn the heat up a touch but other than that EXCELLENT!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Gyros and other Greek delights and light on your pocketbook..."}
{"text":"Gyros-nirvana  Today's edition of the Waunakee Yelp Chronicles brings a glimmer of culinary hope to the 53597.  Yes, Waunakee has become destination dining for those folks who have a hankering for that bar time staple, the gyros.  I kid you not.  Old Trader Gus  knows his way around a gyros spit as evidenced by the droves of lunch time diners that converge on a Shell gas station in the middle of nowhere.    The gyros meat is the star of the show.  The tender, flavorful pieces of quickly flamed beef and lamb are deftly seasoned with Greek oregano, salt and pepper and topped with a creamy homemade tzatziki sauce.  Toss on some freshly cut tomatoes and onions and cradle it in a soft, fresh pita and you have a weapons-grade gyros that will set you back a mere $6.49.  Good times, good times...  I tend to pass on the fries which are fringe average at best.  Given the massive serving size of the gyros, why dilute the experience?  Service is lightning fast.  Even during the peak of the lunch hour crush, my gyros is generally ready by the time I finish paying the cashier.  And the restaurant is extremely clean, exceptionally so by gas station standards.    One tidbit of bad news: you won't be able to get your bar time gyros fix since Athens Gyros closes at 10pm."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and its hit and miss. Skip the spanikopita - its reheated over and over during the day. Don't pass up the Gyros and tzatzki ever. Fries are definitely hit and miss - IF they remember. The value for the Gyro alone is phenomenal but I've started skipping the fries for price and quality."}
{"text":"If you need a gyro fix, this is the place. The menu isn't large by any means, but what they offer is done well and the portion size will satisfy the biggest appetites. If the traditional lamb/beef gyro isn't your thing, chicken and eggplant versions are available, as are salads and soups. Dessert choices include baklava and frozen yogurt......a full bar and drive through is also available. It's great having this on the north side of Madison......I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food looks great, the place looks great, but it isn't all that. The meat was cut too thick and wasn't sizzling and crispy. It was lukewarm which made me gag. The newly opened restaurant/bar is clean and pretty inside but the restroom situation ruined it for me. No diaper changing station so I had to do it out in the public dining area on a sofa. Gross, right? It's what happens when a restaurant doesn't have the necessary accommodations. I'll post pics of the food, but I only ate a few bites. Somehow the ratio was off inside the gyros so I didn't enjoy it. The fries were thick cut and hot. They were the best thing there but not necessarily worth the 30 minute drive from Fitchburg. And the salad was horrible. So sour without any good flavor. Just drowned in lemon juice. The servers were friendly though so 3 stars instead of 2 for hiring friendly people."}
{"text":"I love me some good gyros!  Don't let the gas station fool you here - these are top notch.  If you get the plate, it's a TON of food (you'll need more bread - fyi).  The gyro/fry/soda combo is more than enough for most anyone.  The meat has a fantastic flavor and everything else, well, it's 5-stars so what can I say??   Any location for Athens will do.  They have a location on Odana Road with Pizza Pit & Pizza Extreme that is convenient for west side workers.  The Athens at this location has a nice seating area that's clean and receptive.  If you like Parthenon (the high bar), these are no different - the same really, as most people point out it's the SAME GUY.   I really miss the Cross Plains location, but I can get my fix pretty easily with the various other locations.  If you like gyros, you MUST try these!  Out of this world..."}
{"text":"I've watched Athens Grill transform from a Gas station addendum to a food truck to a free standing brick and mortar restaurant, all in the same location. Each time I'd drive by I'd think 'I should drop in there some time...'. Well, I finally have and it exceeded ALL of my expectations!  I dropped in to grab take out dinner for the family, but needed to kill some time before doing so. I walked into a brand new and extremely pleasant dining room. This first big surprise was a very welcome one! The layout is a bit unconventional, restaurant ordering is sort of tucked into a nook around the corner from a full bar. The bar is very appealing and well stocked and The bartender (Jordan) was friendly, helpful, engaging, and enthusiastic. The happy hour is generous, running 3-5 daily and I can HIGHLY recommend stopping in for wings and a draft beer ($8 total). The wings are dry rubbed with a really flavorful blend and cooked perfectly (crispy but not dried out). I love the side of apple/celery slaw and the dipping sauces were EXCELLENT!  After a quick and delicious appetizer I ordered pitas, fries, cheese curds, and a salad to take home to the family. In just a few minutes I had a nicely packed bag that smelled delicious and was on my way. When I got home I discovered the only disappointment on the night, our salad was not in the bag. I called Athens and they offered to send a gift card to make up for the mistake. It hasn't arrived yet but when it does they'll earn a star back from me!  All of the food was delicious, well cooked and seasoned, a bit messy, and most importantly DELICIOUS!!! I never would have imagined a grilled eggplant pita could outshine a gyro but I have to say it was VERY close. That said, the chicken pita was the star of the night. I got one bite, after that my wife and kids took it apart like a pack of hyenas or school of pirañas. The fries were also very good (although no fry benefits from a steamy to go container) and the cheese curds were dynamite!  We will absolutely be returning to Athens Grill, probably soon and with friends, and I hope the next time is as good as the first. If so you can bet this will be one of our new local haunts! I'm also really hoping that gift card shows up promptly so I can feel good about kicking this rating up to at least four stars."}
{"text":"It is great to have this place near Waunakee and the food is always good and consistent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time with my in-laws and two-year-old daughter. We all loved it. The space is open and inviting with plenty of room for groups of all sizes.   The bar area is a nice spot and they had ~8 beers on tap, including at least one on nitro. It was a solid variety including some of the better local brews. They also have a fully stocked bar.   As for the food...it was all great. The adults all did gyros. They were fresh and delicious. We also shared a half order of the wings. They had an excellent dry rub and two great dipping sauces, plus a nice, refreshing salad of cucumber, apple and olive oil. My daughter did the macaroni and cheese and scarfed it down. It was a nice portion and you could tell they used real cheese.   My only gripe is that it isn't closer to downtown."}
{"text":"The gyros here are DELICIOUS! I was a bit skeptical as the food cart is behind a gas station, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The meat to toppings ratio was perfect and all the ingredients worked so well together to create a great flavor.  I loved the heated outdoor seating option, its perfect for a date night! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! Sure you're getting a gyro in a gas station but who cares?  Athens Gyros is hands down the best gyros in the Madison area....yes better than the Parthenon. A lot better.   The tzatziki sauce and meat are fresh and made on site. The pitas are always warm and soft but not chewy like some. The seating area is small but always clean and well maintained. There are plenty of high chairs for your little gyro eaters and the bathrooms are clean. BONUS: Since it's in a gas station, you can basically get any kind of drink you'd like!  We live 25 minutes from Athens Gyros but we regularly make the drive!"}
{"text":"I like to start off trips north with my stomach filled with one of their tasty, over-flowing gyros. I'm not kidding, they're enormous. Like, the size of my head -- not that I have a particularly big head. Gyros aren't all they make. Neh, Athens also makes a mean Souvlaki, Spanakopita, Baklava, Galaktoboureko and Karidopita.  The top-notch menu easily ratchets Athens Gyros to the realm of gourmet road food. They should've named this place Hermes' Gyros, as he's the Greek god of roads. Sure, it's no sit-down, reservation-only, hoity-toity joint. What, with the lack of linen napkins and flaming goat cheese OPA! -- go to Detroit's Greek Town for that. Athens Gyros is a must-visit for anyone in the area or passing through that has a penchant for authentic flavors of Greece.  Do not be deterred by the unassuming and humble exterior. Do not allow the Shell Station's fuel pumps out front to sway you from exploring the truly authentic menu. Your taste buds will thank you later."}
{"text":"After waiting for months to get our gyro fix, I am happy to report it was worth the wait!  There is counter service that you walk up to and order. This is  for food and soft drinks only.  If you'd like something from the bar, that is a separate transaction at the bar in the dining room.   We ordered our gyros, found ourselves a table and placed our numbered wooden spoon on the table.  I went to the bar to get a couple beers and our food arrived shortly after I arrived with our beers.    The fries were crispy and hot and there was the perfect amount of creamy cucumber sauce along with thinly sliced onions and piles of meat. The pita was warm and soft. Just want you want in  I took a lot of my extra meat and onions home. Only cardboard to-go containers are available and I'm not certain that is the best choice for this drippy meat. Time will tell.   There was a brisk to-go business and I also noticed a drive up window which will be great for an after-work pick up.   Nice job, Athens Grill!     UPDATE: Went again on a Friday night. Young kids (under 5) sitting at the bar with their parents. Not cool in my opinion.  Once again the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not really a gyro person, but the wife sends me here on occasion to get one, and from what I hear, they're excellent.  They have a few other non-greek sides available, including cheese curds and fried fish/cod.  The cheese curds are good (usually have them finished in the car by the time I get home) but the fish is not (I got it once and will never again - frozen crap quality fish).    Overall, as usual in my reviews, just happy to have more options in the general Waunakee area.  Amazing that more restaurants haven't opened up out here."}
{"text":"The famous Gus's Gyro now is served in an enviornment that it deserves!  Gus trained and mentored the new owner over the past couple of years before transitioning and opening this new stand-alone restaurant!   Counter service inside is easy and there is plenty of seating inside.  The even have a bar with outstanding craft beer selections on tap and an impressive liquor selection (their bourbon line-up is quite impressive)!  Prices are still reasonable, but most importantly of all, the gyros are still the best in town!"}
{"text":"Nestled next to the gas station where its food truck used to park is a new grill to enjoy.  The parking lot is fairly small-we managed to squeeze our minivan into a spot next to a sedan that opted to use one and a half spots even though those spots are wide enough to trust a new driver to park in.  Nevertheless we stood in line behind a few others in order to eat a pita.    There is quite a bit of seating.  However, it was full.  There were no stools open at the bar and a lot of the tables could seat 6-8 people but would only have 2-3.  Since we live 10 minutes away we vetoed asking random strangers if we could join them and ordered our food for carry out instead.  Some of the added pluses-the food was ready within 5-10 minutes even though it was busy.  It was fresh and hot.  (Warm enough to stay warm in its container on a 10 degree day while keeping my thighs toasty the 10-15 minute ride home.)  If you are a fan of Greek food you should enjoy it.  If you're not they do have cheeseburgers on the menu and a kids menu as well.  They are also working on drive-thru servicing, but if you need to go inside it's not a long wait and there's enough space to not feel like a sardine."}
