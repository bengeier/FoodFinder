{"text":"The owner is an absolute darling. The cevapi here is to die for, exactly like in Bosnia. The best Croatian food I've had for a while!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!!! We asked at Bianca Amour, which is across the parking lot, if the food was good. Everyone said YES, plus service is excellent, and they are really Nice. Well, we have to agree. Be sure to share as portions are large and finish off with a 'to die for' Chocolate Truffle!"}
{"text":"OMG. This is the best food I have ever eaten. How? A little place in industrial section of calgary. Owners love and care and attention is in this food.  12/10. Don't miss out. Have to go to Paris to eat this food. Wont be sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding home made food! Fresh right of the grill! Highly recommended! This restaurant is family owned and food is made fresh every day. Being from Balkan i know what it should taste like and this is spot on."}
{"text":"Cozy Kitchen was recommended to me by not one, but two Croatians as the place to go in Calgary for authentic Croatian fare. I'm glad this place was recommended to me, because I likely would not have found it, otherwise, with it being located slightly off the main thoroughfare in the SE.  Cozy Kitchen is a deli of sorts, serving what I assume to be Croation comfort food including perogies, cabbage rolls, beef and chicken soups, goulash, roast chicken and, the signature dish: cevapi. In addition to these main dishes, there is a small display of baked goods including various bars and cookies.  As recommended, I tried the cevapi: a dish involving small, spiced, skinless beef sausages served in a buttered pita with diced raw onions and sour cream. I'll admit that I found it strange that the side vegetable was simply diced raw onions, but they provided the perfect sharp bite against the rich meat. Everything is made in house, even the sour cream!  The service at Cozy Kitchen was fantastic. Visiting on the holiday Monday at lunch time, the restaurant appeared slow. In addition to the main dish that I ordered, I was provided a complimentary serving of the day's chicken and rice soup with pita, plus a sandwich cookie to go.  There aren't many places to try authentic Balkan foods in Calgary, so I highly recommend visiting for a new experience."}
{"text":"5 stars! I don't give 5 stars unless there is something amazing. But this one is an exception! Because for the price, quality and quantity... I would give it more than 5 stars!   Quick review : If you want a home cooked meal just go don't think twice!  Ambience/service - fun, delightful, hearty, cozy and casual - just like visiting your aunt or grandmas.  Food - Try the Cevapi, Goulash and Cabbage roll paired with coconut covered chocolate sponge cake. And the Lepina (Bread) is heavenly! Everything is fresh and you can taste the quality of the meal - lots of flavor.  Price - $7-$10 and dessert is $2-$3 Portion - a meal would be between medium and large per order.    Detail review : A cozy restaurant run by a wonderful woman from Bosnia who used to be a lead baker at Sunterra market for many years. What you have is this amazing combination of an extremely talented baker matched with a delectable Eastern European cuisine.   The menu is very simple! Only 4 breakfast items and 7 lunch items to choose from - plus dessert. With some classics like the Cevapi, Goulash and cabbage roll there is something for everyone.   The flavors are skillfully balanced and well priced. Everything is made fresh even the sour cream is made in house! You can taste the difference with AAA beef and freshly baked bread/desserts. This is not a run of the mill restaurant - the meals taste as if it came from your own mother's kitchen!   The best Bosnian restaurant I have been to for the price and quality simply put this Cozy Kitchen is a wonderful delight not to be missed!"}
