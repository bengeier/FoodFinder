{"text":"I went to the West 25th location on 7/8/16 at 5:50pm because I had to provide dessert for a dinner party of 10 tonight on short notice & thought their cupcakes would be perfect. One of the workers made eye contact with me at least twice while I was standing at the counter waiting to be served but never acknowledged or offered to assist me. Instead she stood there talking about a potluck she was to attend, asking the other coworker what she should bring & saying how her friend's loved that she worked at Campbell's. I left empty handed & when I called to ask for contact information for the owner or general manager 'Jackie' informed me that they could not give out that information. When I worked in Lakewood I visited that location often & was so excited that there was a store on W 25th since I switched jobs & now work downtown. After today I will just have to do without. I refuse to spend money where I am not respected!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops at the market to try new treats and get old favorites.   Their candy type items are very very sweet - like the chocolate covered Oreos or the Buckeyes - however boy are they tasty! The popcorn samples always help me make my decisions on what I'm taking home that day.   Today was beer cheddar, original dichotomy, white cheddar jalape√±o and the super sweet green apple something or other - 2 for $8 is a great deal in my opinion.   In the past I have gotten their chocolate dipped pretzel rods for holiday parties...as well as cupcakes for work events.  Lovely spot in the market & their storefront is a great addition to the Ohio City neighborhood."}
{"text":"YES YES YES and YES. Did I mention YES? This place is thebomb dot com! Dichotomy popcorn is where it is at. I kid you not, I drive from Akron when I get the hankering for this stuff....it is like crack on a kernel. Kinda like sh*t on a stick.....but better! I would drive from Poughkeepsie if I had to, it is that good.  I love how I can sample it all before buying anything. Pizza? Pickle? Tutti fruity?  No, these aren't pregnancy cravings, they are popcorn flavors. Something for every taste I tell ya! The cupcakes and chocolates look scrumptious, but I can't get past the popcorn enough to try."}
