{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant that had a warm atmosphere and great food  and a friend recommended Marios. 
The location was inconspicuous as it is in an old White House that sit back from the road 
Once we walked in, we knew that we were in for a treat. The inside was all barn board and was broken into a number of smaller rooms and a great bar. 
We had not expected white linen tablecloths and dish ware to add to a feeling of subtle elegance. But the combination worked beautifully. 
We had dinner and everything from the lobster bisque to the broiled tuna was  perfect. 
The price matched the quality of the food which was what any of us hope for. 
We will return with our friends. 
We highly recommend Marios!"}
{"text":"I think a 12 year old can cook a better meal than what you are served here. Huge waste of money."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Cabin for 15+ years and have always considered The Cabin a special birthday/anniversary place to go. No longer. 
   We had a terrible dinner no one enjoyed, and after complaining to the most unconcerned, insensitive manager, we essentially got a \"Who cares\" response. So with dozens of high quality restaurants in Northeast Ohio, we actually agree, \"Who cares?\"

{"text":"Ahhhh - I love the atmosphere and decor.....particularly around Christmas.....Mario's wife still goes all out!!!  But the service and food is suspect and inconsistent to say the least.  This is kind of like your kid wandering off the path.....I just want to jump in and point them in the right direction.....but you get the feeling no one would listen.

We did a small dinner (12 people) and everyone was disappointed with the service when the waitress from 1920 chased us off at 830 on a weeknight.  There have been times we've sat at the bar and basic wine choices (house sauvignon blanc) are out, or a chianti was so old, it should have been used on a salad as red wine and vinegar......

Could be great.......but...."}
{"text":"I went back because I want to like this place.  I do like the Christmas decorations but things seem to be worse since my last visit.  The bartender seemed to be hustling and seemed like he cared but at the same time didn't want to be there.  Only two beers on tap, so if you are a pint person, this isn't the place for you.  I ordered the mussels.  I usually expect some sort of wine/butter/garlic/spice broth.  The broth it came in more closely resembled mop water.  Really really bad.  Many mussels were broken, aren't these usually disposed of? It comes with four pieces of burnt toast.  How do you burn toast, and if if you do, why not make another piece instead of sending it out? Couldn't finish it.  24 hours later, how shall I say....I was not well.  I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food...mediocre service. Never received the waiters name or acknowledgements throughout the meal. Pretty atmosphere but maybe not worth the price."}
{"text":"I recently went... about a week ago.... filled out an app ( my grama thought it was a nice place) and was called back to follow there veteran server Amy. I was shocked at how extremely dirty the place was. The back hallway leading to dish tank area was fowl.  Walls, paint, floors and countertops were dirty with grime... server station was falling apart. And large amounts of dust covering everything in dining area. Not mention the extremely outdated 1980s decore...  just when I thought it couldn't get worse...I went behind the bar...which hasn't been properly cleaned since the 80s. The flooring and tile are falling apart. Glass wear was dingy...  the liquor bottles improperly stored and not covered. AND get this... Amy soaks the dishes in bleach!?!?! To turn the water on she actually had to crawl underneath the nasty sink and manually turned the pipes on!?!?! I was appalled.  Meanwhile a table of 6 walks in and ends up spending 800+ dollars on their food and drinks... the wine that was  served was spoiled and they new it...( red wine showing threw cork ) it was oxidized according to staff but served it regardless. Last but def not least while I was waiting on their food to come out...which was the only good thing about the place (recently new chef was hired) a huge spider repelled from the ceiling next to my face! Talk about nasty... the wait staff then explained that wasn't anything compared to the spiders they have seen. So next time you think about eating there think twice! Horrid."}
{"text":"So the atmosphere is gorgeous and cozy not tacky at all. Walking up to it and going inside is just like a cabin! Now parking is a b**** so be prepared ... We went to the bar and had the mussels in a yellow curry sauce and the lobster cocktail soaked in light vodka sauce. What a remarkable finish to a stressful day! Cheers"}
{"text":"In the winter it's a wonderland. I'm the summer, you can sit outside in the patio near a two story waterfall. They finally have a good chef who consistently makes me happy. The prime rib was great, just order the small one! My husband and I shared the large order and it was almost too much. 
The lobster ravioli is always good. The wine list is limited, but lots of fun martini options. Make a reservation in winter for the fireplace side."}
{"text":"I have dined at The Cabin several times before and wanted to share the place with my friends. What a disappointing experience. Why do diners need a flat screen TV in the dining room? The ambiance was ruined - the fireplace was enough. Also, who runs out of their signature Zuppa di Angostura so close to the start of the dinner hour (5:30pm)? There were four of us in our party and three ordered that soup. Only one serving remained. I thought I was lucky to be the one to get that serving till it arrived at the table sans any recognizable lobster meat and certainly no tomato basil creme evident - nice presentation. Not so lucky, I guess, bottom of the pot. I also ordered the chocolate mousse; it tasted artificial and had been spooned over cholate syrup in the dish. Sweet but disappointing. Two of us ordered hot tea but only one tea bag was offered to each of us despite two refills of hot water. It seemed the waiter couldn't be bothered providing us with basic service much less a positive experience. He never made eye contact , was curt, and walked away from the table several times while we were talking to him. He has been a waiter there for years but his heart didn't seem in it last night. I won't go back anytime soon, if ever."}
{"text":"Encouraged that reviews were not recent.  Encouragement was misplaced ideal.  Claudia Y. was correct, mediocrity is not achieved. It is also possible that we have insulted the folks who make the food found in the Sysco trucks."}
{"text":"The cabin had gotten pretty bad up until about 2 years ago when the current chef came to the restaurant. We've gone for lunch, happy hour, or dinner around 8 times over this time and have had really good food. The service has been well intentioned, but a little clumsy at times.

First off, a major positive of The Barn is the atmosphere. The interior finish is constructed from a disassembled Barn from the 19th Century making it a very relaxing environment that's suitable for casual or more formal dining. It's particularly cool during the holidays (Christmas for me), and no matter your faith, I believe you'd find it inviting and beautiful. 

Our experience this afternoon was no different from others. Our very pleasant waitress couldn't find a wine list. Once the bottle was ordered, no wine opener could be located. Not a big deal, just a detail thing that I would blame on the restaurant management rather than her. 

We were dropping in for appetizers without a reservation and had to sit at the bar. No problem, but she had to work all of her reserved tables, and us, and the bar, and any other walk ins with two other servers. Staffing problem?

Anyhow, the appetizers were great:

Crab cakes 5 stars
Bruschetta 5 stars
Crab soup 5 stars
Meatballs 5 stars

Previously, we've loved the following dishes: seafood de mare, porterhouse, filet mignon, porterhouse, and halibut are a few that come to mind. All five stars.

Why the 4 star overall rating? Essentially, I see a lot of opportunity for this restaurant to be managed better. Get new menus made (not the food, just the menus), make sure the bar has all the tools the servers need, staff the restaurant correctly, get draft beer taps, refresh the wine list to include a better blend of Old World with New World. That's a start.

With all of that, I would def recommend a visit to The Cabin at Mario's."}
{"text":"Wow. Let me just say this to sum it up. DONT EVER GO HERE and PLEASE DONT EVER EAT HERE!!! First, we spent 300 dollars for a dinner package. A little much, but fine if it was worth it. This place looks like it's right out of 1820. I couldn't enjoy my massage because the floor freaked every time the therapist took a step.
The restaurant? ::puke:: the 35 dollar prime rib came out cold after waiting 53 minutes for the food to come out... NO EXAGGERATION. I order a Conway's Irish ale and he date on the bottle was March of 2015.. yes 2015.. that's 3 years old! The server had the nerve to ask me if I tasted it to see if it was good. The beer has no preservatives and it's 3 years old!! No way I tasted it. The butter was FREEZER BURNED! Horrible service, long wait, stale beer, way over priced. No one should ever go here and the health department should inspect them ASAP!!"}
{"text":"oy. they strive for mediocrity and miss the mark. the lobster bisque was bland and barely hinted of seafood. the caesar salad was actually decent but it's an uninspired menu and i'm sure that the sysco truck pretty much takes care of most of the food supply... as for the decor, it's a funny little throwback of a place. earnest at best. but really really not for me. or you."}
{"text":"For a couple of years I hesitated going to this place cause of the bad reviews, but throwing caution to the wind we tried it in January 2016..
   The people with the bad reviews are crazy, YES the service was a little slow BUT many diners were in the place, besides unlike the other reviewers I enjoy the company I was dining with so the slower pace was nice.
  People complain about the TV's in the dining rooms HATE to tell you Folks YOU were in the Bar, There are Two other rooms One with a fire place also. The Tables for two had comfy chairs. The salmon was fantastic and the Steak well cooked and so tender..
I have since been back two other times and I've always gotten great service I just can't understand  the bad reviews and I'm a world wide traveler. Yes as all places of business they can have an off night, or service bit slow when you have a small party of 12 HA HA 12 small? or the waiter doesn't look you in the eye as one reviewer stated (In some area's doing this is an insult) I believe the major flaw with the reviewers is this being Aurora they expect to be served like Royalty or the Snobs they are. The meals are a little pricey and I wouldn't buy the drinks I believe $9 for a Jack and Coke that I thought was insane. 
  The Bar/dining tables are a fact but you must remember this place is also a small Hotel.
The person here who complained about sick after eating the sea food 24 hours later was sad IF it was the shell fish he would have gotten sick a few hours after eating not a day
The person complaining about the food and being ripped off with the Gift Certificate THAT is why they have expiration date, SO he complained about the food also and not how lazy his wife was and waiting so long to redeem all business work that way.
Overall I'd give this place a B+/A-"}
{"text":"Very nice Saturday evening dinner with friends. Service was good and the food was fine. Wonderful piano player. Nice touch. Salmon dinner was prepared as requested and my lobster pizza was delicious. The drinks we ordered were not over done which was nice to be able to enjoy them without waiting for the ice to melt."}
{"text":"This place is so calming and relaxing! The service was great and the food was AMAZING! I spent the day at the spa and then had lunch and dinner here! Some entrees were a bit pricy for dinner but it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We were here a few weeks ago.......will never return. Mgr/hostess was very rude. Ordered filet medium rare and came out well done. Mgr insisted the steak was perfect and argued the point with us.  Next steak was medium so we ate it ..... Very tough... Maybe not filet?  We will never return.  Many better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Rude and unprofessional service.  I went there on Mother's Day after a spa day with my mom and sister.  The spa treatments were wonderful but The Cabin was awful!  I had a reservation and I actually saw it in their books but they refused to seat us or even pour us water for another 45 minutes because they \"closed\" between lunch and dinner (don't make a reservation during that hour then!).  The whole staff talked about us right near our table.  The food was not good and was definitely over-priced.  The only vegetarian option on their menu was a children's menu item and they wouldn't let me order it."}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews of this place.  Place just looked cool as I was driving by, so we stopped.  Gotta tell ya -- inside it's like an old, comfortable cabin but the Christmas lights and decorations are amazing!  Took some pics, but there is NO WAY they did the place justice.   We had the crab bisque, Italian meatballs and lobster ravioli and all were excellent.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended just for the Christmas decorations.  Walk in, walk around, check out the decoaration and walk out.  Or stop and have some food.  Either way, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"mediocrity
food that seems to be from a 
refrigerator

Not a lot of good things to say here.  The atmosphere is nice.  It has not changed in years.  The ubiquitous over sized flat screen hovers over the bar, visible from most of the dining area.  sigh...
The food is a study in mediocrity. The menu is not at all adventurous, with a lot of Sysco influence.  
Nothing to see here folks...  ...Move along.

Carry on."}
{"text":"Extremely inhospitable and unwelcoming. We were sat in a tiny room behind a large party, this being our first time, you'd think they would have the decency to seat us in a central area ...at all the open tables they had.... our waitress I won't even go into details about. Management can contact me privately even if they even care. Extremely disappointing due to the service or lack thereof. the food was okay, menu was limited for the holiday season so that was again a disappointment but one I can live with. I was interested to use the spa services here but I definitely won't be returning and will not recommend to anyone I know. Took forever to get waters, bread, the basics of service. worst holiday experience I've had. On another note, the decor was very cute but what's that worth when you feel completely uncomfortable anyways."}
{"text":"Great location and cool old cabin like decor. The service is rushed and crabby. It took an hour to get our appetizers then and another hour for main course. Drinks were left unrefilled, wine took forever to get. Simply the worst service I have experienced both in speed and in attitude.

Otherwise the food was very good, I had the red pepper and sausage pasta. Others had the striped bass, chicken parm. all enjoyed thoroughly.

Don't do the creme brulee...not worth it, probably made days ago and left in the fridge...at least that's how it tasted.

Overall a good place to go in Aurora, but you get way better service at Cafe Toscano with similar food,"}
{"text":"This place  used to be OK but I think they've lost their minds with the prices. Lobster ravioli was priced at $32. (I've had it before and it's nothing fantastic.) Just about all the entrees are over $20. I tried the angel hair with marinara ($14) and compared to Cafe Toscano just down the street, it was average. My husband had chicken that came with a gorgonzola risotto and the risotto was bland and not cooked thoroughly. 

There are so many other places nearby that are better. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Your gran would really like this place.

The setting is really special.  They transformed an old cabin into an elegant spa dining room.  Sadly, they kept the Early American giant flat screen TV showing cartoons.

We started with a calamari appetizer.  It was odd.  The calamari was tender and breaded, but really soft.  Was it fried?  Was it previously fried, then steamed or baked?  Was it sprinkled with crumbs, then baked?  It certainly wan't fried, then brought to the table.  Hmm...

The waitress was kind enough to bring a bowl of buttered pasta for Herself.  She was also brought the scallops than Mon Cher Chou ordered.  Sadly, she did not bring me the roast pork fillet I ordered, but instead the steak.  She was kind enough to correct the mistake immediately.

The scallops were OK.  The roast pork was some of the best I have ever tasted.  Beautifully seasoned with fresh herbs, juicy  and expertly roasted.  That would have bumped the place up to 3 or 4 stars in and of itself had it not been for the debacle that was the risotto.

The \"special\" risotto was anything but.  I swear it tasted like Uncle Ben's  The rice grains were not aborio (they couldn't have been!!)  and they were rough-- like parboiled rice.  If you are going to feature risotto, please make risotto.  Look in any cookbook.  It is time consuming, but not difficult.

Dessert consited of an oddly charred sponge cake, the non-charred bits of which were really good, ice cream and chocolate sauce.

The funny thing about this place is that people over 60 love it.  LOVE.  Perhaps it is the very charming space, or the live piano music, or the old fashioned menu.  Perhaps it is because risotto didn't come into vogue until their dining out patterns had been firmly established."}
{"text":"Have to agree with most of the reviews.  Rustic old style rooms with white twinkling lights giving a nice ambience.  Lunch menu included sandwiches, pastas, several salads and soups. Lots of choices. My panini sandwich was presented on what looked like French toast bread with a hardy slice of ham, maple flavored bacon and melted cheddar cheese. $13. Was very good, but I would have been happy paying $11 or less. Many lunch meals were up to $20. You need to try it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been coming here over 10 years and I have had the best meal of my life here in the past (bacon wrapped filet mignon with crab over Swiss chard) the environment is great and I've always loved coming here. The last 3 times I've came here it was borderline terrible. I really want to like this place from the memories and environment...but the food continues to get worse every visit and the wait staff could not be more arrogant and rude (not all, but one in particular, we all know who he is) I don't know what else to say. It's a shame the place has fallen so far from where it once was. I would avoid this place and go anywhere else. Hurts me to say but I'm done with this place. All good things must come to an end."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and waitstaff were very nice.  The food was just ok for the price, the appetizers were the best part."}
