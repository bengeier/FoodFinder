{"text":"I've been for lunch a few times and the service and food has been good.  I will continue to go."}
{"text":"A very nice diner with an extensive menu to either take out or eat in.  We have been been taking out form this diner for over a year and have always been very pleased with the service and the food is always excellent.  The prices are very reasonable and affordable."}
{"text":"Won't.  Go.  Back.  To call the service \"lackluster\" would be a compliment.  Sheila, my waitress, behaved like it was an imposition to wait on me.  There was no courtesy, no thank you's, no.. warm and fuzzy.  If I didn't ask for a refill, she wasn't offering it.  Didn't ask how my meal was; just didn't do anything that a server should.  Many of the tables hadn't been cleaned when I came in, yet the restaurant wasn't busy and the waitstaff didn't seem to be under pressure.  I ordered a gyro and cole slaw.  I'm positive that they peeled open a gyro package from Sysco and tossed it in the microwave.  It clearly wasn't cut from a spit and it tasted worse than any gyro I've had before.  It was garnished with some diced tomatoes (probably from a can too) and that's it.  The tzatziki and the pita were the only things that tasted good.  I wouldn't forgive the horrible food or horrible service anyway, but the price sealed their fate .  I could have had a better gyro from a fast food joint and paid half as much.  Instead I was overcharged and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews for this place because my experience has been just the opposite. I've eaten here three times in the last month. The greeter was always friendly, brought us to our table, chatted a bit and on two of the visits when they were very busy asked for our drink order. The wait staff was attentive, answered questions and were quick on the refills. I've had breakfast once and lunch twice. The breakfast is standard fare, no better or no worse than you'll find in most places.  That's not a negative - you can only do so much with 2 eggs over easy.  For lunch I've had the Rueben and a turkey sandwich. Both were very good."}
{"text":"My one star rating is not for the food but for the awful \"manager\" that delivers HORRIBLE customer service. She was very rude today and made me feel like I was a huge inconvenience for asking her a question. Her negative energy and rude attitude were so distracting that I couldn't even get out my full question. I will never visit here again and I suggest for others to skip this place if you want to eat somewhere with friendly, kind people. NOTE TO OWNER: Find a manager with basic people skills. Customer service skills would probably come in handy as well."}
{"text":"One of its kind in the area! Veggie omelette always just right! Fish and chips the best! Like the neighborhood diner where \"everyone knows your name\". Great value as well!"}
{"text":"Just what I expect out of a diner. Number of options to choose from and a solid breakfast. Slightly overpriced, but other than that can't complain."}
{"text":"Really really good diner. The food is amazing and the service is great. I love that they serve breakfast all day because their egg Benedict's are my favorite. Their hamburgers are also one of my favorites. I love the atmosphere and how nice everyone is."}
{"text":"I was hopeful that this place near our home would be great. Instead it was HORRIBLE! Didn't even get our food cause the service was so bad. Never going back. Sad :("}
{"text":"It started out a good place to eat but, like most restaurants, they began to fall short on the quality of the food and service after the first couple of years.  Several months ago my wife picked up a dinner of fish and fries. The fries were dipped in hot oil for maybe 30 seconds as was the fish. Needless to say wet white fries and soft greasy fish. Today we thought we would give it another try. What a mistake. We sat outside. I ordered breakfast with eggs over medium, bacon and, a glass of milk with the meal. The egg whites were clear and runny, milk was served room temperature. It took 30 minutes for a simple meal and they still got it wrong.  Dear diner,  Don't rest on your laurels, you may not be able to get up again."}
{"text":"I will give the Summit Diner a 4 star. I really think 3 1/2 would be more appropriate.  It was the first time we visited the place and since its like 6 minutes from where we live it was time to try it for breakfast.  Good reception, friendly. The interior is busy. Way too busy, too many signs and different nooks.2 tv's on sport channels.  Maybe it's more suitable for night dining but in the morning it makes you somewhat hyper. But all customers were almost same age (60's) The menu seems to be extensive and I do not know if that is a good thing.  We decided to go with a simple and comfortable eggs and meat breakfast. We thought if that was good it would be a start. Believe me there are places who cannot deliver decent eggs and bacon.  Coffee: very weak. No special coffees to get. Just what they have on tap. We are used to Nespresso, so even before we leave the house for breakfast we have a good coffee.  Two scrambled eggs (looked more than 2 eggs)with bacon (plenty) and a lot of pretty good hash browns, no toast.  Two eggs over easy with 3 sausage links and hash browns, toast.  It was honest fare. Nothing special but well served and the waitress and waiter came to check on us a few times.  Why 4 stars: location is convenient, food was ok. Service was good. People are nice."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food and service has always been on point. I love the unpretentious atmosphere and comfort food here! My only regret is that we didn't find this restaurant sooner."}
{"text":"Really good food!...    I first went there because I got a coupon in the mail, so I had to check it out.  I did notice negative service reviews on Yelp, so I purposely waited for bad service??...  and waited???  The SERVICE WAS GREAT.  The waitress smiled, was knowledgeable, and was attentive to our dining needs.  Nice mix of food, as well as a great bar for beer service.  They also serve Vienna Beef Hot Dogs which were made \"Chicago Style\"... Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this restaurant the other day for late breakfast around 11:00.  Not too busy and we had attentive service.  Nice new modern design and comfortable booths.  It's a convenient area for us so nice to see new dining choices.  I had blueberry pancakes, which were excellent fluffy and very tasty.  Husband had a veggie scramble that looked and tasted great. We will return."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST customer service!!! They would not even do a Mickey Mouse pancake for my 5 year old! I've been here several times and it's always the same horrible experience! We are NEVER coming back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Arrived mid afternoon ... no wait.  Like the renovated decor ... like the fact they have booths.  We definitely want them to succeed but based on the quality of food, doubt they'll be open in another month.    My husband and I looked over their extensive menu and selected chicken tenders, fries and fish sandwich.  Unfortunately, they didn't have what I was yearning for ... onion rings.  The chicken tenders looked as though they were originally frozen as were the fries.  Not much flavor for either.  The fish sandwich was tasteless and \"watery\" .... obviously had been frozen as well.  The chicken noodle soup was hardly warm ... vegetables hard and coleslaw swimming in mayonnaise.  Husband commented he \"got much better chow in the Marine Corps ... 50 years ago\".    Our server was good but there didn't appear to be any manager on site ... only the greeter and an ample wait staff.  We won't be back anytime soon, it was one of the worst meals we've had."}
{"text":"I did not like this restaurant at all.  Went for lunch, bill for 2 basic hamburgers, fries and drinks was over $30.  Quality was terrible.  Seemed like frozen hamburger fried in a skillet, fries were just basic.  Service was ok.  Not many people in the place and now I know why.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Veggie omelette, ordered with egg whites, no toast, no potatoes up charge of 1.00 for less food.  Must be the new math..."}
{"text":"Delicious cuisine. Recently went there with my family and I had a burger, which was one of the best ones I've had in a while! Love the atmosphere the diner gives off. Service was amazing, very friendly servers!  My family goes out very frequently, and I must say that this restaurant will be one of our favorite places to go and eat! You'll definitely see me there again!"}
{"text":"Longest wait for basic food.  Really nothing special.  Had the egg salad sandwich which had more lettuce than anything else."}
{"text":"Anything you order will be good, great service and great quality of food. They have a lot of natural meats and you can taste the quality. They are always busy and that says a lot. Love this place."}
{"text":"So it was a \"soft opening\" kind of day and we were a little hungry at 2:30 pm, and we've been waiting for this restaurant to open. We don't really have a nearby breakfast/lunch neighborhood place other than The Good Egg (which is old and tired), so we were pretty excited to see what Summit Diner has to offer.  The restaurant is darling, very modern, decorated in greens and blues, with some regular tables, a bar with two plasma TV, and some comfy booths.  They also have some patio seating which will be especially nice in the cooler months ahead. There were a lot of employees abuzz when we arrived. We had a delightful server who wanted to much to please us.  She did!   The food is okay.  I could have given it a 3 star . . . my husband had a turkey Ruben. It could have had a little more turkey, cheese and kraut between the two pieces of thickly sliced bread. I had the chicken, bacon and cheese wrap (on a plain tortilla, though they have tomato basil tortillas as well). My wrap could have had a little more oomph to it as well. I like my wraps nice and full round. This one came out kind of flat. The flavor was not bad, but it just needs something . . . a special sauce to dazzle it up . . . nothing too fancy. Both sandwiches came with a side. We chose the fries, which were actually nicely thin, crispy and hot!  The menu has a bit of everything and they say they will serve breakfast all day . . . a big plus!!!!  So if the food was just okay, then why did I give Summit Diner a four-star review? Well, it is an ambitious undertaking in replacing the old Kashman's that was formerly in that spot, and I think they have the right idea in providing basic \"diner\" food at very reasonable prices. You can't really tell based on a soft opening what's really in store for this desperately needed type of restaurant in the way North Scottsdale area. I think it is definitely worth giving them a try . . ."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening figuring if the service was like other yelpers described then I'd have a conversation with the manager. Thankfully our experience was a good one. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  There was a help wanted sign in the window so maybe the bad ones people complained about were let go. Food was decent  - pretty much as expected from a diner. We'll go back, most likely for breakfast (which they serve all day)."}
{"text":"Came in to have brunch for work, fucking bomb. Best omelet and hash browns ever in the world. Eat here."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Moderate pricing. Great Swiss mushroom burger. Staff friendly and service is great."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and very over priced. Worse of all, there was no friendly diner atmosphere. Customers, staff and owners ignored my husband and I, even when we told them we were new to the area. We will never go back. ."}
{"text":"Just had my first and what will certainly be my last experience at this restaurant. What they are severely lacking is a quantity, not quality of service. The poor waiter, Eric, was running all over the restaurant. They were clearly shortstaffed as others have pointed out in their reviews.  Our table had the chef salad, and spaghetti and meatballs. Both of which were good, not great.  In their defense they do have help-wanted signs in the window. For their sake, I hope they hire some good folks soon or this will be a vacant store front too."}
{"text":"Went on a soft opening dinner.....Fettucine was awesome,a little confused on sides for pasta..french fries or mashed potatos,It was really good so we went back 3 days later...Yikes,had the fettucine and it was bland like out of a jar,not sure how it could be so different,thought maybe a different chef so I asked....same chef.It was absolutely horrible,and my husbands spaghetti was so salty he could not finish it.Wont go back.just not willing to waste money while they try to figure it out."}
{"text":"Great crew and service. All you want a Diner to be.  Great breakfast and pancakes. It's on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month and always happy with service and food.  Patio is great atmosphere and you can bring your dog.  We prefer here over other places for breakfast because you can have a mimosas!! I always have the bacon skillet, it is the best!"}
{"text":"Skillets, omelets, and scrambled are delicious. Pancakes are yummy. However, dont order 2 eggs over medium or whatever, because they will come out scorched and like cardboard. They blame it on the use of a griddle. I blame it on the cook. Too fast cooking and a way too hot griddle Ridiculous they cannot cook eggs to order! One time I sent my eggs back twice, and then ordered an omelet. No where else do we experience eggs being scorched! Very dis appointing!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there and we were quite impressed. Eirik, our server, had phenomenal service - to the extent that exceeded that of some expensive steak houses. The food was fantastic and the canolis are a must for dessert. I would recommend anyone give it a try. Thanks, Eirik for the great service!"}
{"text":"I loved it.  The food was really good and the two servers that were there handled everything very well.  I will return to try another menu item."}
{"text":"Meh. Service is mediocre at best. Bill left on the table when we were not even half done. No one looks too interested in helping their customers, just delivering food. Not sure how you mess up bacon and pancakes but both not very tasty. Pancakes taste as if they have all spice in them. Entire place smells like a gyro which should have been our first sign to try next door. Won't try again. Going to eat lunch at home now"}
{"text":"A great diner. There are lots and lots of choices here, and everything I've had is great. This isn't a fancy place, service is generally good, but food is always good. Breakfast and lunch is best but I have had some good dinners here also. They have breakfast all day so anytime you are in a breakfast mood, this is a good choice. This is also a good place for group, because their menu is so wide, everyone can find something they like."}
{"text":"My first breakfast at Summit Diner was a great experience.  Food was yummy, service was exceptional, and the coffee was smooth and flavorful.  Couldn't have asked for anything better."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this little diner for the longest. So I decided to check them out I must say I was pleased the staff was friendly and the food was delicious I had the summit omelette. And I must say it came with quite a lot of me most places are stingy with the meat but here they're not I would recommend this place to anybody that's looking for a locally-owned restaurant. I will be coming back here to try their Cobb dinner and as well as the buttermilk chicken dinner maybe one day I'll come here for the all-you-can-eat and put it in and there beer battered cod fish supply"}
{"text":"Second time here...first was decent....second time absolutely horrible...turkey Ruben on white bread? I think they nuke the food before it comes out...real disappointing as there are few restaurants on this side of town...avoid dinner if possible...maybe the breakfast is better...didn't finish my meal even though I was starving...was looking for a \"go to\" spot in N. Scottsdale....this isn't it!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood diner. Decent food. Excellent fried chicken on Monday nights only.   Great service! We go here often, if only to get some eggs ... so I'd recommend it as long as you're not expecting \"gourmet\" food, you won't be disappointed.  But like I said ... their fried chicken on Monday nights IS the best I've had here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great diner for breakfast and lunch.  Feels like you are at a small town diner.  Staff are friendly"}
{"text":"What a great diner!  This was our first time visiting and were a little wary because of some of the negative reviews, but were pleasantly surprised at the excellent service and great food.  My husband decided on breakfast and had the pancakes, eggs, & bacon.  Huge portions and very good.  My BLT was one of the best I've had and the fries were really good too.  The service was perfect.  Very attentive waiter who kept our glasses full and checked back often.  We enjoyed dining on the deck with our dog (even have bowls of water for pets).  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad.  It was expensive for what you got.  The thing I just can't get over was the horrible bread they used for their toast!  We asked for sourdough and it looked like the discount white sliced bread you get from the bottom shelf of the grocery store.  Tasted like it too.  It was super bad.  The Greek omelette was pretty good and the hash browns were served somewhat warm.  The eggs were cooked nicely and the hash browns were not greasy.  The service was great!  I would go back I suppose."}
{"text":"I've had several really great meals here.  Good comfort food and they often have specials I like.  The one time I was not so impressed was veal parmigiana but that's my fault as you shouldn't get veal at a place that has the word \"diner\" in it's name."}
{"text":"Place is tucked away . In the Safeway shopping  center . They opened  ahead of  schedule.  Server was friendly and attentive.  Ordered  the breakfast special. Which included two  eggs bacon and french toast. Tried repacking french toast for biscuits and gravy .biscuits  and gravy was tasty. Good potions 4 pieces of french toast. Price was reasonable  for the area. One website rated the restaurant  4.5 stars that's why we tried it . Still  pleased"}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Summit Diner about 6 times during December 2012 and January 2013, and have been very happy each time.  Love that they serve breakfast all day.  We have had mostly breakfast dishes -  omelettes, scrambles & skillet dishes - and have loved all of them.  My husband had the meatloaf once, and it was just OK.  Their service is always friendly & attentive.  The decor is fresh and pleasing to the eye.   Prices are reasonable.   For those reviewers who went there during their opening days, I'd suggest giving it another try.  Unless something changes, we will be dining at the Summit on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Just used them with Uber eats, crappy grilled cheese sandwich ever.  Wishing we could return it."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Haven't been here in awhile which I regret it, and I was so impressed. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. Very attentive, full of suggestions, and courteous. We noticed several people that came in were regulars and were greeted by name.   As far as the food, we were not disappointed in the least. I had the Summit Skillet, and it was fantastic. My partner had the Chicken Fried Steak and we both thought it was one of the best we'd ever had.   The coffee was great, had non dairy creamers for us lactose free guys, and it was an overall wonderful experience.   I don't know why this place isn't rated higher. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed. :) :) :) A++"}
{"text":"Very nice casual dining with everything you can think of on the menu! Great, friendly staff with reasonable prices and large portions! Try it, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place cause a couple neighbors said the food was good. As we were walking up to the diner there was a lady who put her plate under the table and let her dog lick the plate. This happened outside on the patio. We just kept walking to Safeway and bought some bacon and eggs and went home. Some dog owners are pathetic. You love your dog. I don't. To let your dog lick a plate that people will eat off of is pretty pathetic. I said nothing to the lady cause I was too offended and probably would have been very nasty. Wont go to Summit again. I want to eat with people not animals."}
{"text":"Gyros are awesome!  Owner is Greek American!!!  Not a fan of the waitress Nancy though- she is straight out of Ed Debevics. Insulted me for ordering a reubin and a pancake on the side.  Ask to NOT sit in her section.  Seriously, she's THAT bad.  A good indication of this is, when you ask her her name, she never gives you an honest answer.  She literally lies to your face so you won't complain to management about her.  I'm surprised she's still there!  Good wait staff and highly recommended is Greg.  He's very attentive, kind and quick on his feet!  Just look for the big burly muscular Dude- that's Greg."}
{"text":"What I like is that it's a diner.  Kinda feel like diners have disappeared these days. Usually I get a the tuna melt.  Have to ask for a tomato, which seems ridiculous (who doesn't put a tomato on tuna melt?) It can be hit and miss, mostly hit.   Like the space too. Plenty of room so you don't feel crammed."}
{"text":"Worst meal here EVER! 3 of the 4 entrees were wrong. Daughter ordered crepes without sauce, they had sauce. Husband ordered meatloaf and was told it had gravy. Came out dry and with no gravy. Ordered salad w no cucumbers. It had cucumbers. I ordered a burger medium, with no pickles. Inedible well done with pickles. I can't stand pickles & the juice was all over the food. Waitress said the owner was in kitchen and she'd send him out. Never bothered to come by. 2 of us didn't eat anything & we still had a $30 bill. We've frequented the diner 7-8 times before tonight. We won't be back after this."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again.  I'm tired of my food being burned, not what I ordered and then just excuses by the wait staff.  I live close by year round and have tried to give them chances.  NEVER AGAIN.  STAY AWAY.  I order an omelette.  I tell the waitress, light on the eggs, they usually burn the eggs.  She says ok and puts my order in.  Shockingly I get delivered a burnt omelette.  She asks me how's my food?  I tell her burnt.  How do you deliver burnt food especially after asking them not too?  The whole omelette was dark brown.  Her response was I'm sorry...  I told them light on the eggs.  Never once, we can make it right, I'll take it off the bill...  Nope, she sees I didn't eat the omelette but delivers the bill in full.  Really?  So you burn my food, I can't eat i but I should pay you for it?  Awesome!"}
{"text":"First time here..wasn't really expecting too much..because of the \"Diner\" name. BUT was really surprised had the Angus burger it was very good, my wife had the cheese ham sandwich which was also good, service was top notch,prices reasonable, looks like a great place for breakfast so will be returning for that."}
{"text":"OK - no - it doesn't have a Michelin star ... but that's not what I'm expecting from a Diner... but if I were to compare it to others I've been to - one of the top for sure!  First - the location is easy - lots of parking and shopping.  The service was fantastic.  Some of the best I've enjoyed.  Staff were attentive, quick, friendly, and very helpful.  I noted that many of them were stopping by each others tables to check in, offer help, etc.  I noted several regulars in that many of the staff knew them by name.  One couple drives over every Saturday morning for brunch - 45 minutes each way!    I had the chicken fried steak.  Cooked perfectly.  Gravy was VERY flavorful.  Eggs just as I asked, and the hash browns were perfectly cooked.  My dining companion had a skillet (I hate to say I can't remember which one it was) - but both of us said \"wow\" after our first bite.   Water and coffee cups were kept full.  Table was kept clear - but never felt like folks were \"hovering\" ... I asked for the manager - he/she wasn't on duty that time - but they sent over the senior staff member there that day and I think she was thinking \"oh my - a complaint\" lol.. but I had nothing but praise.  She filled me in on many of the inside stories... owners who are passionate about their food and service, food that is prepared fresh onsite - no Sysco can's and buckets!  I noted a couple of notes about the french fries... I'll have to try them myself and see - that's one of my pet peeves - gotta do the fries right if you want the other ingredients to shine when they're on the plate.  They offer nice weekend drink specials and lunch and dinner specials each day.  I'm looking forward to the next of many visits.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"While all the other breakfast establishments in the North Scottsdale/Cave Creek area are jammed packed on a Sunday, this place was warm and welcoming.  Yes, they had a full house, however quickly made room for my party of two.  A quaint bar area just in time to watch the undefeated carolina panthers remain undefeated.  Food is great!  Lots to choose from.  All day dining off the breakfast/lunch/dinner menu is always a plus.  You must check it out!"}
{"text":"YUM! Good food, good prices, and friendly service. The whole family will enjoy this diner. So many options that everyone will find something. Trust me, I'm picky; it's good."}
{"text":"Not to often I give 1 star reviews, but here it is. Today after church, my husband though we should try somewhere new to us. The Summit appeared to be bright, clean, and not crowded .... Odd for a Sunday. We requested outside seating. Then fixed our table so it wouldn't wobble. They ate strictly food service group diner. Nothing prepared by themselves. Pancake pricey and chewy. I didn't finish it. I also ordered a scrambled egg, I guess with the large crowd of two our server had he got mixed up and I got an over easy egg. They fixed the mistake in ten seconds, with a mistake scrambled egg they had in their warmer 1/2 cooked , cold and semi hard. Did not eat that either. Paid our bill. Went around the corner to Starbucks:)"}
{"text":"Very average at best. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which I could make better at home but it was not terrible. However the hash browns came out barely cooked. I asked if they could have them cooked a little more. The smart*** cook dropped them in the fryer and had the server bring me basically shoestring frys. The server knowing they were bad brought them to the table anyway. I told her just forget the hash browns. I would suggest you forget thinking of eating here."}
{"text":"I liked it. I had a gyro and thought is was great. The fries were good too. The service wasn't great. We had to seek someone out to pay the bill and didn't want to interrupt our waitress who was in a very loooong conversation with regulars.  But the food was good and the environment was clean so when I am in the mood for a diner, this is the place.  The owners should probably stick around a bit to see whats really going on. The place could be cool."}
{"text":"I've now eaten here once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food is nothing to brag about but it's not bad either. The menu consist of typical diner food (sandwiches, burgers, soups, etc).   The service has been great every time I've been here. The prices aren't bad and the atmosphere is pretty casual.   All things considered, Summit Diner is worth checking out if you're looking for something to eat and want to try something new."}
{"text":"Refused to accept gift cards & proof of purchase - Buyer Beware Scam  Rotten Mother's Day experience to say the least.  Long time customers, we purchased $300 in gift cards Dec 2017.  The last 3 times we try to use them we had issues, ending today in refusal to accept.  We offered to show proof of purchase (credit card statement from Costco Citi VISA) to which we were told the owner did not care and refused. Asked to speak to owner and were told the owner's not present.  We asked to call the owner to which the answer remained a refusal.  Wake up Summit Diner owner, you cannot steal from your customers & make your staff do you dirty work.  Despicable business practice to your most loyal customers. We've always enjoyed your food, service and selection but your choice in this matter is baffling. The lifetime value of a customer alone should have been enough for you to do the right thing.  The proof should have cleared up any questions.    Our children were there to witness the entire event on Mothers Day.  Not so classy.  We hope you will come to your senses and do the right thing."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick dinner after shopping. Very basic comfort food. Don't expect great food, but it's stuff your 50s mom might have made...nostalgic. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere comfortable. They have a daily all-you-can-eat meal."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood, but not from out of state.  The customer service was outstanding, thank you Michelle, excellent job!  I agree with another review, its food your 1950's mom would make, it's tasty and its priced very reasonably. Can't wait to return and try other items on menu.   I look forward to bringing my husband on my next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I can count on this place to offer standard fare, attentive service and value pricing.  This time we both ordered \"fish & chips\".  While the fish was delicious, the batter light, the \"chips\" were ordinary frozen French fries, lacking flavor.   We know from past visits that their menu items, particularly their breakfast options which are available all day, are tasty and do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Skip this place at all costs! We must have picked a bad night or this place forgot what it was here to do. I thought it was strange when my toddler's chocolate milk had so much chocolate in it that it was more like a desert. My Saturday night special was supposed to be 2 Cajun pork chops. Instead it was 3 small pork medallions about the size of golf balls. They were dry over cooked and a side of mashed potatoes that had chewy bits of something that I couldn't identify. My wife ordered fish and chips which didn't taste bad but the batter was clearly the same as the \"all you can eat\" on Friday, Tuesday and Wednesday. That should be a clue if a place needs to offer all you can eat specials 3 nights a week. The waitress was nice enough but brought our main dishes first and then our soup and salad. She described the black bean soup as \"beans in water\" so I ordered the tomato basil. My stomach is now telling me I should have skipped this place at all costs."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get. Summit diner has 20 tables and delivers their food directly to you, simple and delicious, and a great addition to North Scottsdale options.   I had the Reuben with a side of coleslaw. Could not of been better. Every component was very tasty and it was good to the core.  Strongly recommend you try this place for a nice, clean, efficient diner experience"}
{"text":"Pretty good  breakfast food - liked the meat lovers scramble. Not too greasy for what it was."}
{"text":"This place is very charming with welcoming wait staff. I actually ate at Summit two days in a row- once for lunch then again for breakfast. Very nice please to enjoy food home cooked comfort food."}
{"text":"Was at Target and then had an appointment, so with time to kill, thought I'd treat myself to lunch.  Nice place.  Bright, clean, well-decorated.  Service through-out was very good, if not warm and fuzzy.  Although I seated myself, I had a menu within moments, ice tea came promptly and was kept filled.  Server checked in twice to see if there was anything else I needed.  If there was a service problem before, it's been rectified.  Food: I ordered a chicken gyro and upped to onion rings for 99 cents.  Maybe a bad choice---I can't help but compare what I had at the Summit with the gyros from Greek Pita at Happy Valley.  All I could think was GFS (that's Gordon Food Service)  The chicken was plentiful on the nicely grilled pita, but there was nothing Greek about it.  It tasted like an anonymous herbed chicken breast that comes in a 10 lb bag.  It was okay.  It's probably the same anonymous chicken breast they use for a couple of dishes.  About a tablespoon of small dice tomatoes and two (I counted) slivers of red onion.  The tzatziki came in one of those little lidded plastic cups and if it had any flavor, I could not discern it.  The onion rings were definitely out of a GFS or Costco freezer.  But they were crisply fried and not greasy.  But for flavor and satisfaction, I'd give it a two.  Quantity of food: a 5.  If the level of food had matched the service and cute decor, this place would have been a winner and on my list.  But as it is...  Waaay over priced at $9.99 for the gyro and then the upcharge for the onion rings.  (Lunch for one person was fifteen bucks and some change)  But for that kind of lunch money, I want food that's been prepared for me, not defrosted.  Like I said, I am a fan of Greek Pita and you can't compare what you get from GP for 5.95 to the Summit gyro.  However, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Maybe ordering Greek at a Scottsdale \"diner\" is akin to ordering Italian at Applebees.  You deserve what you get.    I might try it again, if its the right time and place---maybe another menu item would be better.  I'll let you all know...."}
{"text":"Poor food quality, extremely over priced, idiotic staff. Get this.. I ordered a basic scrambled egg and bacon breakfast with toast. Toast came out burnt to a crisp..sent it back..literally 10 minutes later I got the toast when most of my breakfast was near gone (eggs were hard/chewy) and bacon super greasy. Then, I paid the ridiculously high bill and left. I decided to try this place one more time.   I was in a rush so went in and over to the counter, and ordered two slices of white toast to-go. LITERALLY 3 nitwits behind the counter asked me for my order, repeating it almost incredulously. Folks, this is a breakfast place, I'm sure people have ordered toast! Almost 10 minutes later, out came the toast on a paper plate..stupid *sses, this was ordered TO-GO! Put the toast in some foil! How hard is it to make a basic breakfast and make some toast to go! This place needs to go..away!!"}
{"text":"The Summit is SOLID!  They have a variety of different menu items and serve breakfast all day.  True diner fare with a modern touch and family service from people that really care.  It is our default \"Go-To\" for good food in the neighborhood.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast!  The portions are large, and  the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have a huge menu with options for every taste.  We enjoy the Summit Scramble it is delicious!  I highly recommend this diner!"}
{"text":"The food is really good . I'm surprised with how many negative reviews this place has. I been here multiple times and I have always had a great experience . Staff is very friendly and you have a lot to choose from . Very affordable too. I will be coming back soon !"}
{"text":"My husband and I think this place is awesome!  Every time we've been here the food has been excellent.  Erick our server was prompt, attentive and super nice!!!  We LOVE the Summit Diner and will be back many times."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!!  They treat you like their neighbor they have known for years.  The food is quality and the prices are very reasonable.  If you are looking for a quick and easy dining option, then Summit Diner is your place!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays in business..before yelping I always try out a place a few times to give it a fair review. This place has now burnt my food all 3 times. Sent back on last visit and got only marginally improved food. Omelette was burnt, bacon burnt and greasy. Toast overcooked..how the heck do you screw up toast in a diner! Over priced, lousy food, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Been there for breakfast twice before and thought it was awful - food, service, atmosphere - but decided to give it a 3rd chance. It's really difficult to screw up breakfast so I figured they'd get it right sometime. Well, my hollandaise sauce was ORANGE, the orange juice was YELLOW and service was ... wait, what service?? It was non-existent. Never. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Great service & food! Enjoyed the veggie eggs Benedict and a Bloody Mary. Very fast & friendly service..."}
{"text":"We were driving around the summit and saw the diner. Thought we would give it a try. When we walked in, no one smiled and said welcome or anything. We sat at the bar. The server came up, didn't introduce herself, and just said \" what do  you want to drink\", that was it.  We ordered food, which was good, a little pricey and the presentation was lacking. It looked like the food was just thrown on the plate.   I will give it a second try to check out their breakfast, but if the service and presentation stay the same, we will probably not come back.   I hope the place heeds some advice from its customers. It's nice to have something local at the summit."}
{"text":"Amazed this place is still open. Food portions are small and overpriced. The food comes out either really good or really bad. No regularity in quality. Staff is always not attentive and look miserable. Came once to try it and came back to give it a second chance. Not fooling me three times."}
{"text":"The first and only we went to this place, we left because of the uninformed and seemingly uninterested front end. We went back today thinking that things had to be better...and they were.  The staff was friendly and the food ok...certainly a step up from our first time.  A big plus...it is very convenient to a killer Safeway grocery!"}
{"text":"We tried Summit Diner for the first time tonight - after living in the neighborhood for over 2 years.  Noticed a lot of diners ordered breakfast items; we ended up choosing fish & chips and beef stroganoff from the dinner special.  The food was average but prices were reasonable and in line with taste/portion.  And we were pleasantly surprised with the great/speedy service we received.  We will likely come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I just have to start out by saying I love this place. They never disappoint me. even though its just comfort food the quality and quantity are always the same. I love the chicken creaser salad there, its better then a lot of the more expensive recusants around here. The servers are really nice and never slow to come back and refill our drinks (maybe once but that's okay). I like that you can sit anywhere you want and you are always helped right away. the food is made hot, fresh, and fast. One other thing I like is that they have a dog friendly patio, because I mean who doesn't like taking their dog everywhere!?"}
{"text":"The female server here was terrible! It felt as if it was an inconvenience for her to wait on our table. She was short with us, unhelpful with questions about the menu, and just flat out rude.   It's unfortunate our experience with her was so bad. We had been recommended this restaurant by another. The atmosphere was decent and the other server working seemed to have a good attitude with the tables he was serving.   Food was only mediocre. Not good enough to want to go back and put up with her again. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because it's so close to my house, but the food was so disappointing. I ordered breakfast - the eggs we're dry, the bacon was fatty and undercooked (I asked for crispy). My husbands meal wasn't anything special either... Too bad."}
{"text":"Decent place...only had breakfast and it was kind of bland but in some ways, I was glad...nothing was seasoned or salted but the food was fresh and well prepared.  I hate overly salted food so I was ok with it but almost too bland...the service was great and our waiter was super nice and accommodating  as we have two babies.  I would go back for sure as it's right up the street from our house.  Pretty small and weirdly decorated...like a diner meats hodge podge cheap crap from Ikea or something..."}
{"text":"We brought our family along with 5 of their friends here for breakfast.  The greeters weren't very good at trying to coordinate seating so we ended up sitting separately from our kids.  The kids promptly put in their order and received their food.  The kids weren't happy with the quality and some barely touched their breakfast.  We waited, and waited, and the kids were done eating for 10 minutes and we still hadn't received our breakfast.  We had only received water, and had not been offered other types of drinks.  We left money for our drinks and proceeded to leave as they decided to bring our food 35 minutes later.  I'll never return, which is sad because we frequent local breakfast places."}
{"text":"Not bad. Service is always good. The Ceasar salad is good and reasonably priced. Nice to walk in and get a table immediately."}
{"text":"If you have the meat loaf make sure to get it swimming lessons since they make it swim in Brown gravy. Maybe let the taste of the food speak for itself. Otherwise all was good service was alright also."}
{"text":"A great informal place to eat.  Wide selection of food, great staff, reasonable prices.  WIFI and breakfast any time!!!  My favorite place!!!  Bill, Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Cute place with pleasant servers in a convenient (for me, anyway) location. The accolades end there, sadly.  Have only dined here once, but the food was forgettable and frankly, not good. SD needs a better cook!  I'd like to frequent the restaurant as it's local for me, but the food just isn't good :("}
{"text":"Great homemade food, breakfast all day (wow) and VERY friendly service! Try it, you'll l"}
{"text":"I have only eaten there once but it was great. It felt very comfortable. Neat and clean. My doctor's nurse recommended them. Not stuffy. The menu looked like \"comfort food\" but not typical greasy diner fare.   The service was fantastic. I had the Reuben with cole slaw. Both were wonderful. Even the cole slaw was so good I could have eaten a bowl of it! Their food is obviously homemade.   I will definitely try them again even though they are not on my way home."}
{"text":"Terrible. I gave this place a second chance and was once again disappointed with my $17 omelet ! More feta than omelet, turkey sausage was fried hard and uneatable. Server never asked \"How's everything ? Is there anything else I can get for you ?\" Leaving most of my \"breakfast\" on the plate, I left $20 bucks lighter and once again disappointed. Should have gone to Good Egg but try to support independents. How does this place remain in business ?"}
{"text":"The Summit Diner is a pretty good breakfast and lunch place in the North Scottsdale/Cave Creek area. They really have no specialties, but the menu is solid and has everything you'd expect from an alright diner: pancakes, eggs, burgers, sandwiches, etc. The breakfast burrito is the one thing that really stands out. It's enormous, really well put together, and at $7.99 it's the best thing you can get for your money. They have about six different beers on tap and a full bar, which is nice."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here in a long time.   Previous experiences have been quite bad and I saw no reason to return   Comments on yelp corroborated my position.    My wife came here recently and had a very positive experience,  so decided to try it again.   Tonight was different.   Norma was our server.  She was both quite pleasant and efficient.  This was a great surprise based on previous times.   Food was very good and portions were good.  Prices are somewhat high, however.   While  on the not on the top of our favorite local restaurants, we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good aside from a few pieces of black lettuce in my salad that should not have been there.  The food tasted fresh and good."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices and a bright and cheery atmosphere. The food ( fish and chips) was delicious and with very large portions ( maybe consider splitting a dish). Service was a bit slow, compared to the lack of customers in the dinner and being off hours. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Passed by many times, decided to try dinner with friends. I probably got the weak link in their menu, because their patty melt was not up to par. The meat was plentiful but tasteless, the bread hard as a rock. The coleslaw mediocre. I assume that their breakfast is great because in the am they draw a nice crowd. I'll give them another try for breakfast since there's a need for it in the area. On the good side, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today and it was excellent! The server was fast,  & friendly. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Will come back again and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"MUCH improved over a couple of years ago.  Great breakfasts! We had delicious veggie skillet and veggie Benedict's."}
{"text":"This is a great place for any meal!   Delicious food, plenty of it, all for a good price.   Don't miss eating here!   My wife and I eat here often."}
{"text":"I hadn't ate a poorly made meal  and dealt with an sorry excuse of a lackluster staff in any restaurant until I went to Summit Diner. That's saying alot about a casual restaurant. Also the staff are completely miserable and the vibe accurately reflects the poor quality of the meals that was served to the customers. To make matters worse, the price is far too expensive for its own good and and the quantity of the meals are way too inconsistent in size. If this is not enough to convince you, I had friends who got food poisoning from there from of the water cups. So if you value a quality meal for your breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I would suggest that you stay away from this restaurant and go to StarBucks instead. I'm amazed this restaurant is still open."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super clean. I have been here for breakfast with my husband or for lunch with co workers and I just love this place. No matter what you get their portion sizes are huge and service is always excellent."}
{"text":"We probably eat at Summit Diner once a week since it's so close to our business.  Nothing but friendly customer service all the time.  Recommend for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food! customer service is excellent.  Our go to food pickup place as well as eat in.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped by and had the boneless buttermilk chicken all you can eat special. Soooooo good. Plus the cup of chicken noodle soup that is included is very tasty too."}
{"text":"The food was average and arrived to the table in a reasonable time. The server appeared irritated  when we asked for honey to go with the tea; the honey was never delivered. My bacon, cheese and jalapeño omelet arrived sans bacon. The culinary oversight is considered a felonious act by many. The server only arrived again to deliver out check; too late for bacon at this point. When I addressed the issue with the server she said \"well, I always repeat the order\" Bravo Sierra!  Too many other good breakfast places around here to consider returning."}
{"text":"Went for a late breakfast on Sunday with my husband even though we were able to sit right away the place was very busy. The wait staff were trying to hustle but the service was slow. We started out inside and the acoustics inside are so bad that we moved outside and heard others complain about the noise level. Between the clanging of dishes and a squealing toddler it was far from a relaxing atmosphere.  The food is okay, the omelets are nice size and have several varieties of omelets to choose from, they come with a large helping of hash browns which were crispy on top and soft inside. The breads are just the basics that you can buy at the store. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"This is already a place where the staff knows names of people coming in for a hot breakfast - I observed it this morning.  Demographics are mostly middle aged to retired folks, with the latter having a good time exchanging quips with their server.  Sizable outdoor seating exists here as well as good room inside with rather modern decor, including a curved bar for solo patrons looking for a quick breakfast.  Background music was on the quiet side.  I enjoyed my 2 egg breakfast with hash browns & English muffin.  Pancakes were just alright though.  On the menu the omelettes sounded good, as well as some of the vegan options made with tofu and assorted veggies.  Breakfast served all day so I know I'll take advantage of that.  Update:  Service has gone downhill on recent visits.  Attitude issues from server for no good reason."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here for a weekday lunch. Fast service and friendly waitress. Huge portions prepared well. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
