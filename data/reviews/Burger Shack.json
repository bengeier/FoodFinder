{"text":"Very tasty.  I get the home burger every time.  A little expensive if you want a combo, but just the burger is perfect."}
{"text":"I went the other day for the first time, they have great burgers, and awesome onion rings.
A must to try"}
{"text":"The food here is over-priced garbage. If you are able to get past through to the stage of actually ingesting the food, then you must have no sense of taste or smell. The food here looks like vomit and tastes even worse. Their burgers may as well be made from roadkill festering under the sun and teeming with maggots. They are greasy, tasteless and clearly consist of the lowest grade of beef. The chicken souvlaki consists of shriveled, dry chicken pieces or some other kind of questionable poultry. I could not tell whether the chicken pieces were so small from being over-cooked, being small to begin with or a unique combination of both. The fact that someone would pay as much as they charge for their food is ludicrous and insane. The fact that I came here starving and left starving because the food was excruciatingly inedible should serve as a warning to others: Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I first have to apologize to my fellow yelpers who had fairly warned me this place wasn't all that great.  But I thought 'the place has been there around 30 years, it has to be good' and I held onto the glimmer of hope left by the good reviews.  But I have to say I was left very disappointed with Burger Shack, and its thin unflavorful burger.  I wasn't overly impressed with the french fries either, which had an odd taste to them, and the milkshake was a huge let down.  
I think I might have been somewhat ok with my burger had it not been just under $12 for my burger, fries and shake.  
I came home wishing I had gone to Craft Burger instead.

And like other reviewers, I'm also left feeling confused at the two burger options....fresh or frozen."}
{"text":"Burger has a great char, rings are fantastic, but you must add your own salt (critical)"}
{"text":"A general rule of thumb when you go to these burger diners, always ask for the homemade burgers. The regular burgers are frozen patties and basically the same regular burger you would get at Harvey's. I used to go to Burger Shack every saturday when I lived in the area about 18 years ago. All burgers were homemade back then, tasted great. The souvlaki was full of greek herbs/spices and the homemade garlic sauce was amazing. Over the years they've changed the recipes in order to appease the mostly Canadianized area. I remember one guy actually got offended that his souvlaki had garlic and oregano on it. Made a big stink about it not being more Westernized. Idiot. Like most places it's not as great as it used to be. They still have great homemade burgers, fries are good. The souvlaki is a pale shadow of what it used to be but to most Canadians it should be fine. Cheaper than a Mcdonalds premium burger combo, more food and tastier in my opinion. Small place, small washroom, small seats. Very clean place though.  A solid 3 stars."}

I see the reviews for Burger Shack are all over the place. I stumbled upon Burger Shack a few years ago but I never had a chance to try out the burgers until yesterday.

The Shack looks likes it's been around for awhile by the worn out exterior and interior setting. But that didn't deter me one bit as I was starving. As I walked in I was greeted by \"Tony\" (not really sure what his name is but he definitely looked like a Tony) who was at the cash. A look at the menu and it's pretty obvious that the Shack does more than just burgers. I noticed anything from fish & chips, to souvlaki, to burgers. But since I'm a Burger junkie and the place is called the BURGER Shack, I opted for the \"homeburger\"  recommended by Tony, which came to exactly 5 bucks after taxes. 

What's the verdict? The homeburger was pretty big and it was cooked to a well done with good grill marks and served on an A-OK bun. The burger wasn't fantastic, but it was good considering the size and also the price."}
{"text":"Best turkey burgers, hands down!  Onion rings are the bomb, but if they aren't cooked long enough, they can be soggy.  That was our first experience, anyway.  Pie and cake are also the amazing!  Friendly staff, very clean.  So nice to have somewhere to go in the Topaz/Coleville area that's yummy and affordable."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here when I randomly had a craving for a good, juicy burger.  This place is called Burger 'Shack' so you really shouldn't expect it too be all shi-shi inside. Though I must way that I was taken slightly aback when I came in since the tables and chairs are from way back when and some of the chairs (you have to push down the seat) were crooked. I was scared that I was going to break them (especially while eating...how much of a fatty situation is that?). 

Anyway, I got the home burger with all the toppings (standard condiments, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, hot peppers and sauteed onions).  The toppings are laid out so you have choose whatever you want. The patty itself was a bit on the thinner than I expected but nonetheless juicy. It hit the spot. 
I had the chocolate milkshake which tasted a bit like McDonald's chocolate soft serve ice cream back when it was around but just a bit more softer (well...technically ice \"milk\" but that's another topic entirely) . It was just a tad softer - I ended up using my straw like a spoon until it melted a bit. 
My friend had the strawberry milkshake which tasted like strawberry flavoured Tylenol for kids. I didn't like it at all. 

Overall, a great burger place if you're in the area but I wouldn't make the trek out just to go there to eat."}
{"text":"Burger shack has been in the same spot, doing the  same thing for as long as I can remember. Staff are friendly and consistent with their behaviour. Burgers are great value, simple, and don't leave you feeling like crap 20-minutes afterwards. If you're more into overpriced burgers with toppings you cant even pronounce, then stay away from burgershack...otherwise, get off your high horse and enjoy a classic burger!

side note: while the onion rings are epic, i would stay away from these if you tend to shy away from greasy food... They are massive, they are epic, and they may leave you on your back in a food coma;)"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, the Burger Shack... where do I begin? My girlfriend lived across the street from the Shack so often times I would wake up to the sweet smell of burger in the afternoon.

But don't get me wrong, the Shack is not just open evenings and late nights, you can get breakfast as well! And the place is always packed. Well, pretty much always. At night it's filled with drunk teenagers and after bar stumblers and in the morning it's populated by construction workers and early risers.

Don't let either deter you! 

The food produced from a simple flat grill and a deep fryer is pretty darn great. There's no great secret to producing basic non-franchise fast food, but the Shack manages to do something very right, from the homemade burgers (worth the extra $) to the yummy onion rings.

My girlfriend doesn't live there anymore (cuz she lives with me :) but every time I pass by there with some friends or my significant other the sight of the Hawaiian inspired sign is met with squeals of delight from this girly-man and followed by little jumps of excitement as well as protests to stop for some grub.

Oh Burger Shack, how I miss you..."}
{"text":"Very close to home and the onion rings are prolly the best I've ever had. 25 percent off for military as well"}
{"text":"The patties had an amazing flavor and the many many toppings they offer put it over the top.  The fries were good but needed salt. The onion rings were tasty as was the gravy. Very low key kind of place where you order your food at the counter and then they call you up when its ready so you can tell them what toppings to put on the burger.  The buns could be a bit better but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. Best in T.O.
And unlike that joint on the highway between Chicago and San Diego where Nash used to work... you won't find a severed finger in your fries..."}
{"text":"I actually love this place - good burgers (including veggie burgers), delicious chicken fingers, awesome fries, and a great selection of drinks.  I find it insane that the chicken fingers cost $9....for four chicken fingers and no side.  And The garden salad is plain lettuce and tomato. I don't actually eat tomatoes, so for me the garden salad is just lettuce.  Even Harvey's has cabbage, cucumber, carrot, and tomoato in their salad.  So while I like this place, I wouldn't eat anything other than a burger and fries there - despite the fact that their chicken fingers are so good....but not worth $9 for 4."}
{"text":"With all the 'trendy over the top and superbly OVERPRICED burger joints' popping up in Toronto the past couple of years, I had to write a review for My go to burger staple in the city.  Burger Shack is not the best burger this city has . . that can be debated until the end of time!  But I believe that it is the Best Bang for your Buck Burger in the city!

BUT Burger shack has consistently cooked up quality fresh tasting burgers for me for a very long time.  They have proper pricing for their food. NONE of this $9.99 base price for a burger BS.  Their staff is always nice and not smug (like other trendy burger spots).  

I also enjoy their Chicken Souvlaki very much.. it's not as good as the Danforth, but it's pretty damn good coming from a burger spot!  

For people who don't want gross mcdonalds flavor in their mouths after eating a burger or would like to have some extra $ in their pockets after, I Highly recommend Burger Shack!  OH and they're open LATE!"}
{"text":"Finally! If you are tired of every other burger place copying Smashburger with their round ball of ground beef flattened into a patty on the griddle and cooked using drywall tools, then this is a place you have to try. Good old fashioned fresh ground beef cooked on a charbroiler and served on a fresh kaiser with fresh toppings. Old school delicious!"}
{"text":"I have visited the Burger Shack only once but I was most impressed.  When you first enter, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant is clean and neatly organized.  The views of Topaz Lake are very nice.  

The beef used in my burger was moist and juicy, without seeming greasy.  It had a very tasty flavor.  I ordered medium-rare and my burger was a perfect medium-rare.  That doesn't happen often in a lot of other restaurants.  My burger was also served quite hot, which is a nice touch.

All of the toppings on my burger were totally fresh and crispy.  The flavors were good.

The fries were some of the best I've had.  They were firm and neither greasy nor too salty.  As with the burger, they arrived very hot.

I liked the burger somewhat better than the two places in Walker, which are also good.  I am equally fond of the Junction Bar burgers (a couple miles north), however that's a bar rather than a family-oriented restaurant.  You can get a beer with your burger at the Junction Bar, but the Burger Shack folks say that they are working on getting a permit to serve beer.

I think you will be very pleased with the burgers at this place."}
{"text":"I heard quite a bit about new contenders around the city. Despite going many different locations, I still find Burger Shack's burgers to be the best. The beef patty seals in flavour and the selection of toppings will please most everyone. I particularly like their sautéed onions. 

 The only thing the new upstarts have that this place doesn't are sleek dining areas. (Burger Shack could very much use a renovation.) The clientèle tends to be local families during the day. Since I never eat late night, I can't really speak for how it is at that time.

The home banquet burgers are what you want to order. I have everything minus barbecue sauce on mine. Always ask them for the gherkins on the side!"}
{"text":"Best burgers around. Go for home made one every time. Not sure why anyone would opt for the others?? Shakes are great too. My ONLY small issue is that they never salt their fries! But they're great once salted.
Also generally fast and friendly service. Recommended."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and they have good fries too. I used to get the ibion rings but I can't eat onion now unfortunately. Would recommend to anyone for lunch."}
{"text":"Went with my girl friend to this place for the first time and was amazed by there burgers!!! Great food and amazing service. The burgers were huge and the fries were fresh n thick!!!! I had the cheese burger and it was delicious!! Would defiantly drop by when Im in the area."}
{"text":"Nice to have a burger place that serves quality food at a reasonable price. Their burgers are awesome and onion rings are great."}
{"text":"Service is okay, nothing too professional. Average price for a hamburger about average taste. Not worth going out of the way for. Perhaps the chicken souvlaki in a pita might be a better choice."}
{"text":"Went to the burger shack on a road trip and it was there 3rd week open and they are already amazing! The service was great and employees all very friendly. The onion rings are a must! We've got our new stop when traveling the 395! Best burger on the 395!"}
{"text":"The best thing about an unpretentious restaurant is that you can walk in without expectations.  The Burger Shack, on that basis, far exceeded mine and made an excellent kickoff to my Decemburger.

On a colleague's suggestion, I hopped off the Avenue bus at Oriole and Eglinton Ave. W. instead of taking my usual subway home.  The bus doors opened and before foot hit ground I was met with the glorious, primal aroma of seared beef.  The restaurant is unassuming, tucked in the corner of a very small plaza, and the tow truck parked out front gave the place a roadhouse feel despite the fact that we were barely a mile from my home in midtown Toronto.

This place has the kind of old-school decor that defies the notion of an update - backlit brown and yellow menu lettering on slide-in strips, booths with flip-up seats and an ancient high-chair tucked on top of the drink fridge.  At 9PM, the place was better than half-full of Average Joes hanging out and grabbing a bite.

I had had the \"homeburger\" recommended, added cheese and bacon for kicks and sprung for onion rings and a can of Nestea to round the order out (~$12).  My cashier shouted at the man on the grill, who looked like he'd been running the place for thirty years, and he hopped to it.  The topping station reminded me of Harvey's the way it used to be when I was a kid - same toppings, same glass-windowed counter, same bowls even - but the Shack had a more family-run feel to it.  Inspired by a fellow yelper whose name I can't recall, I asked for a few of my onion rings on my burger along with the obligatory lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise.

What a delicious, homestyle burger!  It's nothing fancy, nothing special, but this was a great \"everyday\" burger for sure.  Flavour was great, bun was fresh and unobtrusive and the onion rings added a nice crunch.  The rings themselves were tasty, but lost their lustre as I worked through the ones that didn't make it into my burger.  They're big, beautiful rings, but the batter is the sort of thing you'd see on half-decent Chinese food.  Still, worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"ugh...this burger joint came with high recommendations from a few, but honestly, i was not impressed. it's a small dive, that doesn't look very clean, and the staff behind the counter making your burgers don't either, plus they're not the nicest. the only plus this place has is that its open insanely late, so makes for a good pit stop after a late night out. but if ur in that area around a decent time then i'd recommend heading a few blocks east to yonge/eg and eating there! 
this is not worth it! its around 7 bucks for a burger, no thanks its not gourmet, why would i pay that much? 
must try: obviously their fresh patties as opposed to their frozen ones (why even have frozen option?) but of course fresh costs more, and still not worth it."}
{"text":"This review must go higher! 


In truth: there is no knowing whene the precise source of my joy in du shack stems. I grew up in the vicinity and it is conceivable that many many late night shack attacks have coloured my memory in such a way to make the shack insunderably linked with the happy joys of youth. 

As evidence against this I will mention that I recently brought three friends along to sample the shack--none of whom had ever visited previously--and all of whom were delighted by homeburger, fries, rings. 

In fact, I give support to nothing beyond those items---my little brother loves the bacon grilled cheese---but whatever. 

Note that the other reviews are from people who thought it was unclean: it ain't unclean...it's just not the latest iteration of Burger and Company Gourmet Burger Co. 

You can wait in line at BCGBC. I'll be at this shack."}
{"text":"I had a burger - just a burger. It was delicious! Flavourful and totally matching all the great reviews others have posted.
If you're in the area and looking for a not classy diner atmosphere with delicious food - this is your place."}
{"text":"Met two friends here for breakfast, probably not Burger Shack's best meal of the day. T went for the standard two eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and toast.  It passed muster.  D had the banquetburger, fries and a root beer.  What else would he have at a burger joint at 9:30 in the a.m.?  He loved it.  I opted for the grilled cheese (probably the weakest choice) and fries.  Oh, those fries.  They made the visit worthwhile."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Place is dated, from the seating to the menu board. What's not dated is the deliciousness of the food. It gets pretty packed in here and for good reason.
Try the banquet burger, homemade. Big and delicious and homemade BBq sauce... Damn."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place this is. The food is cooked right in front of you, the portions are huge, and the burgers are as tasty as burgers come. I wish they would give a bit better prices and better combos, but a great place none the less."}
{"text":"This place is good,yet average. Home banquet and onion rings are good, but not overwhelmingly so. Average overall. Way better burger places in other parts of town."}
{"text":"It's an ok neighbourhood fast food joint. Not \"one of the best burger joints in Toronto\" as I had been told. The burger had that homemade taste I liked even though the patty was too dry. The poutine however tasted like a poutine-wanna-be. Gravy too salty and wrong cheese curds. A decent place to eat if you're in the neighbourhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to use my cheat day here."}
{"text":"Burger Shack has FANTASTIC service, great selection of drinks and now they have soup. I come here at least once a week for mouth watering homemade burgers. The Banquet Burger is sooooooo good. This place tops all those other places like Hero Burger, Acme Burger, etc. If you want an amazing burger--come here. It tops every other burger place in the city! And the chicken shawarmas are sooo tasty. 

I try to eat healthy and they accommodate my request for whole-wheat bread."}
{"text":"I first noticed this place after passing by it a few times on the bus. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's always busy, so I decided to give it a try. I got the veggie burger and fries. The fries were awesome and the veggie burger tasted similar to the veggie burgers at Harvey's (which is a good thing because I love Harvey's veggie burgers). They also have a lot of drink options from milkshakes to jones soda to the plenty of canned pop varieties. There's cherry Pepsi, A&W Rootbeer, cranberry Sprite and way more to choose from. The prices were very reasonable, but be sure to bring cash because they don't take debit or credit cards. There is an ATM on site though in case you forget!"}
{"text":"This local burget joint has been around as long as I can remember. I've had meals there at all times of the day, from ordering eggs at 8 am to getting a home made burger, poutine and a shake at 2:30am. The burgers..... For sure get a home burger, the patty itself it's anything too special but the sautéed onions, delicious.  The fries have changed a few times over the year but they NEVER disappoint. Fresh cut and thick but still have a nice crunch to em. And then the poutine.... Personally my favourite anywhere, the fires are already awesome but once you pour that delicious thick gravy and some cheese. It's probably the most delicious thing you can put in your mouth...  B Shack has many other things to offer besides burgers and they do look delicious. But it's like going to Belly Busters, I know there's other delicious things on the menu but when it comes time to order my mind goes on autopilot  \"I'll have..... a Homebanquet, Fries/Poutine and a drink/milkshake.\" 

The rest:
The food is prepared quickly 5-10 minutes depending on how busy it is.... 
Price is pretty cheap, expect to spend $10+ for a full meal, close to $15+ for the whole shabang...."}
{"text":"I am of a certain age that really loves, and appreciates, old school 'greasy spoon' burger joints, ideally run by Greek immigrants, with chargrilled burgers, fresh cut fries, and hand battered onion rings, and a fine example of that tradition is Burger Shack.

What makes Burger Shack better than places like Johnny's Hamburgers for example, (another late-night joint that is mysteriously more loved than its product deserves, similar to Pizza Pizza), is that Burger Shack has a hand patted 6-ounce homemade burger vs. Johnny's frozen pre-fabricated filler-patty, and fresh-cut fries and onion rings vs. JH's mediocre factory-produced junk from the freezer.

Throw in a great location, and late-night hours, especially on the weekends, and you got a winner. 

Best in the city? No. But combined with The Real McCoy, Golden Star Burgers, and Dairy Freez, Burger Shack is a fine example of the \"charcoal pit\" style of neighborhood burger joint, and I'm glad it's still here!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was the best, burger was amazing, the hot dog was the best ever and then there are the hand dipped onion rings - WOW just WOW! Great customer service, the view is spectacular and I can't wait for a return visit.  I highly recommend the Burger Shack when looking for a great burger.  Oh and there is pie for dessert which was magical."}
{"text":"In my quest to not only find the GTA's greatest burgasm-inducing slice of ex-moocow, but to satisfy my ravenous appetite last night, I made a discovery. 
After driving around and found most BBQ and burger dealers closed, the one sure thing told me that they were out of burgers. Seriously, are there any sentences as cruel as that at 11pm on a burger-lusting weeknight? I think not. But I pressed on, and stumbled upon Burger Shack!

First, they get a wink for the late hours. There really aren't enough places that stay open this late, or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough.

Inside the restaurant, it looks...how do I put this accurately...like shit.
Seriously, a high school bathroom would appear more hygienic. The tables were fairly clean, but the seats fold down from the table and are probably as comfy as the homeless guy in the parking lot coming in and shanking me in my balls. In case I didn't make the point strong enough, it's uncomfortable.

The cashier seemed a little ticked at yet another customer ruining her night by coming into the joint, but she was polite with me. I ordered two 6oz burgers, and that's it, which were priced just right. The burgers were cooked quick enough to not be McDonalds alarming, and I left. Screw those tables.

When I arrived at home, to my horror, I noticed that one of my burgers was overcooked. Ok, it was burnt, but I'm trying to make the fact that I still ate it seem less pathetic.
The fact that it was scorched aside, it still had some decent taste to it, and I toughed it out.
Burger the sequel was MUCH better, perfectly cooked and tasty. The buns were also very fresh, and I highly approved of it.

In the end, I'd recommend this place as a 'buy it and get the F out' option for night-owl burgies needing a fix, but beyond that, it's nothing special."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go in the city. Location is very close to my house and staff is always friendly. Yes - it can be busy but the food never disappoints. Highly recommend the home burgers, onion rings, and chocolate shakes."}
{"text":"Great food. Tables only really fit up to 4 people, and the place isn't huge. Been going here for years, the quality has always been good. Little hot in here in the summer. Reasonably priced burgers and souvlaki"}
{"text":"Seeing as it is Decemburger, and after reading my friend Dale M's review, I thought I had better check this place out.

I come from the shwa.  The land of basics.  Where good unpretentious (and somewhat funny/odd) burger places run a plenty.  So to impress me, this place was gonna have to be fantastic.  It wasn't.

I did have high hopes when I walked in and thought I was in the shwa.  Looks like shwa meat, must taste like shwa meat.  Alas, no.  But I will get to that in a moment.

What made it look shwa was that it was stuck in the '70s.  A prerequisite for a fine shwa burger dive.  Plus, when I went to the Burger Shack, it was all men, except for one haggard woman.  There is a lot of haggard women in the shwa.  I was also greeted with cold customer service by the cashier.  Again, quite apparent in the shwa.

I ordered a milkshake that I could have made at home - and better - with beating a piece of bakers chocolate against the floor and pouring some milk over it.

The fries however were great!  Really liked the fries.  

The burger - wtf.  When I ordered, there were 2 options for burger patties.  When I inquired, one was fresh and one was frozen.  Really?!  Who opts for the frozen one?!

The topping bowls are just like the shwa.  When I knew I may be in trouble, is when the man who topped my burger was polite.  That is never a good sign.

I swear the burger had filler in it.  And not fill-er-up good, but filler of an unknown variety.  It had a bit of a sage-y taste.  Not too sure what it was.  It was also cooked to a hockey puck consistency.  Again, not good.

For those of you that are still reading and are familiar with suburban/country lingo....here is how my dad would rate this place:
Cock sucker that parkin lot is like a dog fucking a football*.  If I had my ol half tonne** she woulda had a hard time fitin in der.  The place is pretnear*** like the ones at home, so why the fuck would you drive into the city for a son of a bitch burger?  At least with the city you wouldn't have to worry bout skitters**** in the summer like we do at home.  Plus, I would only drive in here early Saurdee***** afternoon before the fucking crowds and lineups.  The milkshake tastes like pony piss and the burger is cooked exactly how I like it, shoe leather.

{"text":"Friendly and fast service, really good burgers, 25% active Military Discount and a great view of the lake from the patio. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For $6, you can get a nice 6oz \"homemade\" burger. Add a few more quarters and you can get bacon or cheese with it. They have other burgers as well (classified as \"char boiled\") but those are 3oz apparently.

When the patty is ready, they'll ask you what kind of toppings you'd like in your burger, such as tomatoes, onions, pickles, lettuce, and some sauces.

I found the burger to be OK. Some found the meat to be a bit dry.
Definitely lots of grease coming from it.

Washrooms are locked and require you to request access at the front."}
{"text":"The burger shack.

I have been hearing about this place for years. Went their recently after a late theatre show.

Service: not bad. They are open late so you can't complain there. The place seems to be busy, but the service was fast. The place offers only counter service, but this is a seedy burger joint. The counter service leaves something to be desired, it is fast but not overly polite or pleasant.

Decor: okay the place is a dump. Few of the chairs are broken. The place could also be alot cleaner. Many of the tables have not been cleaned, being littered with the remnants of prior meals or just being plane greasy. It was dissapointing to have to clean off or own table to find a place to eat.

Food: okay the food is decent, but the prices are not. There are no combo meals, so expect to be ordering things individually which means the prices add up quickly.  We had two home burgers, two drinks, and two sets of onion rings and the bill was a shade under 30 dollars.  At that price you may as well hit a better establishment.  Now back to the food, nothin really to complain about you will be satisfied. The burger pattie was seasoned well, and was a decent size. They don't skimp on the toppings. If you say extra pickles and extra hot peppers that's what you get, you don't have to ask twice. The sides where good portion sizes, and prepared well.

Decent place. But definately not a Jerrys."}

Mountain View BBQ has better onion rings , and their burgers are about the same . Prices are close to the same . 21 dollars for the two of us with drinks .

RIIIIIIGGGGHHHHHHTTT....great place!!"}
{"text":"As usual, I can't vouch for any meat items but I'm happy to be an intrepid reporter on behalf of my fellow veggie burger hunters, especially those who want that classic homestyle flav with no \"weird stuff\". These ones are what you hope for - big, juicy, flavourful (especially when ordered with the works), perfectly charred and on a fluffy bun. Will most definitely eat again. And again. With fries next time.

I also had the Shack's take on a fish burger on one of their apparently famed kaiser rolls. The fish is the kind with the deep-fried smooth golden shell (à la fish-and-chips). I usually prefer breaded fillets but, with a mouthful of pickles and mayo and kaiser, I had no complaints. Delish.

I was pleasantly surprised that such an old school joint had these options, and at less than $20 for two veg and one fish, it was well worth it. Call ahead and pick up if you want; the inside of your car and the inside of this restaurant are probably on par in terms of decor."}

{"text":"Fantastic!  Tried this place for the first time today and the experience exceeded my expectations.  I sat at the counter and watched the staff carefully grill each burger patty (thick juicy Angus beef) with care and hand dip each onion ring in fresh beer batter.

Result was a delicious meal at a reasonable price.  I've seen this building go through many iterations without success.  I think the Burger Shack will be its final tenant! Staff told me that they plan to stay open through the winter serving homemade chili.  I'm looking forward to experiencing that.

Final note... The yelp map does not reflect the Burger Shack's location accurately.  It's North of the Nevada state line just past the Topaz Lodge.  Stop by... You won't regret it!"}

Chopped, battered, and fried right in front of you if you sit at the counter. This review has my mouth watering and me planning my next trip up north just to go there again! The Burger Shack is going to be a standard stop both on the way there and on the way back from now on."}
{"text":"Really good poutine. Thick cut greasy fries with lots of curds. Portions are huge.

Diner style located near a park we visited to play dodgeball. Was recommended here by one in our group.

Their burgers are alright too."}
{"text":"We got a couple of banquet burguers and they were really tasty.

The place is open late and they have quick service. I just wouldn't advice to ask nor the fries neither the onion rings because they were saggy...

I read in BlogTO that his place has infractions that cold make you contract Food Borne Illness, so I decided to change my rating.

 I hope they learnt from their mistakes, train the personal and improve."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY in this place. Old fashioned and delicious. Nothing extravagant but the food is fool proof. Went here after my buddy recommended it while he lived in the area. Basic condiments they provide. The steak burgers looked good but I definitely want to give their fish and chips a try. If I were a local I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Great burgers and onion rings lovely atmosphere friendly place! Would eat here again."}
{"text":"This was a great pit stop. My only complaint was that the waitress only brought me one napkin. She recovered because she stopped by with a couple more mid burger. 
Nice staff. Great food!"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend near by who claimed to me that Burger Shack was amazing at burgers and other foods. I told him he must be joking and if he really claimed it was amazing that he pay for the burgers.

So off we went and got burgers, fries, drinks and we got gravy for our fries that he claims again \"amazing\" 

Now I've had my share of burgers in the city and other locations but as another reviewer posted about Real McCoy, Golden Star Burgers and others. Now the burger was good not amazing but good. fries were ok got stale fast. But OMG the gravy was the worst I ever tasted in my life. I took one dip and that was it. I threw it right in the garbage called Burger Shack and spoke to someone who claims their gravy is homemade. I said homemade how? In a bathtub? The thing smelled like crap & urine. It was as if they did something to damage it. 

My friend told me come take a dip of mine and i did and it tasted just like mine. But my friend ended up loving is while I hated mine.

Another thing I wanted to point out is how they sneak around charging you more for something. I asked for a certain burger and was asked what sorta cheese i would like on it. I told them what kind i wanted on it and when we got home i saw the charge while I was talking to them about the gravy situation I also pointed out the extra cheese charge. They claim since I didn't want a certain type of cheese they charge more for the other cheese. This is not the way to do business where you start charging people for whatever you feel like without telling them first. Whats next??? Asking someone what they want on their burger and then them finding out they were charged more because they got a certain topping instead of the other one?

Knowing this and with my friend who claimed they're amazing is wrong. They're just meh good that's it."}
{"text":"Ohhh ya burger shack is just the best. Also really funny because they have a sign that says \"No trans fats\" on their window but it's like wait what?? There is definitely trans fats in the food so not sure what that is all about. They have really really amazing peach juice that is hard to find other places now! You know, it's just the mix, but it's soooo good. I get the veggie burger and it's just a regularly good veggie burger. The only down side is that the last time I went the bun was a little bit stale but I mean for the price I look the other way. The cashier was also really nice when I went in. oh AND the onion rings are incredible! Just a bit greasy so best to split them with someone."}
{"text":"What an excellent burger! Wouldn't change a thing and had a beautiful view and a place to play horseshoes. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The food is okay and the prices are fair. The ambience however, will ruin your meal. I've never been in a restaurant with this kind of racket. It literally can hurt your ears. The combo of the kitchen noise, yelling out the orders, and the general acoustic level makes this a place to avoid if you want to actually enjoy eating your burger. 

I've been to plenty of McDonalds playrooms and they aren't even close to this with 25 kids playing. This was like putting your head in a metal garbage can while people hammer away on it with metal pipes. 

How does your burger taste now?"}
{"text":"Blows anything in walker out of the water, onion rings unlike another reviewer were the best I've had, burgers and chicken sandwich are outstanding."}
{"text":"Food was average.  per the reviews I decided with friends to eat there for late dinner.  While ordering one of the kitchen staff steped on the grill with shoes to clean the above area. What a filthy and disrespectful behavior.  We were thinking if there was a cover on the grill but no there is nothing. I advise to not visit this dirty place."}
{"text":"It's not that great. Much better burgers out there.  Their gravy is awful and lacks flavour.  It has some fragrance in it like lavender tasting.  Home burger is quite dry.  The guys (owners) cooking look like they have been doing this for 51 years too long and haven't stuck their plug in a meat socket since 1969.  Fries are ok.   I've eaten probably about 150 different burger joints in my life time.  This is not even in my top 100.  This place is where the rich folk come to say they ate a regular folk \"hamburger\"."}
{"text":"Pretty dees fish n chips at 3am... it's cozy and full of drunken uptowners. Nothing much to say except that the portion was good - it's cheap, I would go again if we were passing by. I wouldn't purposely travel down here to grab a bite though...it's very average when it comes to quality."}
{"text":"No matter where I have lived in the world, I dream of their burgers, their chicken kabab, their tzaziki - and the most incredible fries. When I return to Toronto, the first thing I do is drive over here and stuff my face. Been going there since I was a little kid. Never changed. Not one bit unlike Licks which turned into a tasteless disaster.

My highest recommendation. If you or someone can forward me their tzaziki recipe, you will have a friend for life.

Always busy and always good. And you have to love the sketchy and uppity mix of clientele. From the bum on street to the exec from downtown, they all come here for amazing food at a great price."}
{"text":"MMMMMM. Burger Shack. I went to high school down the street from this place so I am well accustomed to it. If you can get past the 70's decor and grimy plaza (it's attached to a crappy looking Coffee Time) you will be rewarded by a great greasy meal. It is almost like a retro Harvey's where they announce your order into the mic even though they are like five feet away from the grill and you get to dress your burger from the large bowls of items from behind the glass counter. 

The burgers (if I recall correctly) come in different sizes and for a little bit extra you can have their special homemade burger. I defiantly recommend spending the little bit extra. 

The onion rings! Oh the onion rings! If you like golden, deep fried, greasy and delicious onion rings this is the place to come. The only place I've seen them almost as good would be Apache burger but in my opinion the burgers here are meatier and taste better. Their fries are pretty decent aswell. 

I also enjoyed the fact that cooked onions were another option of their condiments. 

They have a milk shake machine but the last time I had a shake here it was a bit grainy and not true to a good milk shakes creamy consistency or taste. 

This place certainly has a reputation uptown as being one of the best late night joints to hit up or just for a deliciously greasy meal."}
{"text":"We order take out from Burger Shack a few times a month, easily.  Someone introduced us to the pork souvlaki dinner with salad and fries and we have never looked back.  Of course when you want a burger or onion rings, this is your place, too.  My family and I have been going here for years and is a definite staple in our dining repertoire."}
{"text":"The best burger you will ever have! All the food is very fresh and so delicious! The service is awesome very friendly and accommodating! Will defiantly be making many more trips here!"}
{"text":"Mom and pops burger joint. The burger is homemade, yummy and juicy. No bells and whistles, you won't see thousands of burger to choose from. It's as simple as it gets... burger, burger with cheese, with bacon, or with everything. 

They also have souvlaki and other Greek food. I've never had those so I can't rate that. 

I think it's reasonable priced for what it is. 

If you're in this area and looking to grab a burger, I highly recommend this place. 

Also, one last important note. It's cash only. But, they do have an atm in the store. 

It's not something I suggest to go out of the way for, but I gave it a 5 because everytime I go here, they are consistently great with their service and burger. Sometimes the wait line goes to the door, not that they're slow, they're just that busy.

Something I wanted to add, they have a free parking lot, which is rare in this area lol."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for this burger joint. It's a total 70s throw back and I don't think anything has ever been updated since it opened but that's A-Ok with me. The fries were spot-on, the onion rings were ginormous, the burgers were finger-licking good and the milkshakes topped off this calorific meal with just the right amount of je ne said quoi. You get to choose your toppings a la Harvey's style, but I think next time I'll just stick to basic toppings so I can taste that scrumptious charbroiled flavour flave!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Good fries. Good shakes. Open late. The only downside is that it's cash only but I know that going in so it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"The burger was about average. Patty was a little thin but large so it was evenly distributed throughout the bun. Pickles were rubbery.

I also ordered onion rings with my burger, which were massive! I was really expecting a lot from these hula hoop sized rings, but was disappointed when I tasted more batter than actual onion."}
{"text":"The thing about an old-school burger joint like Burger Shack is, you simply cannot compare it to more modern places like Burger's Priest and Holy Chuck. The hamburgers at newer places like that are objectively better, plain and simple.

And yet there's something irresistible about Burger Shack. Everything is suck in the past, from the decor to the furniture to the way they serve the food.

And the food is good. On this particular visit, I ordered a 6 oz. hamburger with everything on it and boy did it hit the spot. It was a sloppy mess but it was delicious. And even with that assortment of toppings, I was still able to taste the irresistible grilled flavor on the patty.

The cash-only thing continues to be annoying, though."}
{"text":"Ha another tasty feast at the Burger Shack.    I like the burgers here, very tasty.    I just love the old diner ambiance too."}
{"text":"One of the original home made burger places that make their own fresh patties everyday. Go for the home burgers, the regular burgers are the frozen kind. Onion rings are crispy. 
For those not into burgers, the chicken souvlaki dinner is also a safe bet. Option to get a half Greek salad and half fries as the side. 
Good anytime, but especially good after a late night out with friends."}
{"text":"Poutine at $6.35
Home burger at $5.55
Can pop $1.28

Washroom was in disarray.
Cash and debit ONLY!
Taste was ok."}
{"text":"Good prices. Normal burgers (like hone made) but the service of the hosts increible. Disgusting attention. And only cash. If you dont have, try in the atm in the store. 2$ per use that. I'm really disappoint. Bad service from the kitchen helper to atm all."}
{"text":"When I was younger, many times a year, my family returned to Toronto to visit family, and on nearly every occasion we made a special trip to Burger Shack, which we inexplicably have renamed \"Bongo Burger\" (so much so that we've told people we'll meet them at Bongo Burger, only to be met with their blank stares).

My Bubbe Ida passed in her 100th year, and in the last 5-10 years of her life, first her taste buds started to go, then she began to forget the foods she loved. At 97, for instance, she revealed to us that she'd never had and disliked gelato, though she'd been enjoying it her whole life. But, she never forgot Burger Shack, and she always perked up for an outing to get half (or slightly less) of a Banquet Burger.

With little effort I can feel the crispy edges of the char-grilled Banquet Burger in my mouth, along with the sensation of trying to pick the whole thing up, loaded high with condiments and veggies you get to choose. Then there are the great fries, with thick, dark-brown gravy, and a pink cream soda to wash everything down."}
{"text":"The \"homeburger\", while large, was thin and overcooked, and the topping choices are pretty limited.  The onion rings were absolutely terrible.  They taste like chicken balls.  Very strange.

To top it off, it cost $9 for a cheeseburger and onion rings (no drink).  Go to South Street Burger instead.  Their staff are friendlier, they have whole wheat buns and a huge assortment of toppings, and their onion rings are good."}
{"text":"Burger Shack.  Yep.  It's about what you'd expect for a place called Burger Shack.

I had the cheese home burger (you can have a fresh homeburger or a frozen charbroiled burger) with poutine and my wife had the chicken souvlaki on a bun and onion rings.

Poutine was... weird.  The gravy has spices or lemon juice or something in it which made it taste... unexpected.  Hard to mess up beef gravy but you can easily do so if you get creative. Cheese curds were flavourless, likely a lighter cheese, which is fine.  Fries are fine, nothing special but good enough.  Overall, I wouldn't get the poutine again, too fancy for me.

Onion rings were dark brown meaning the oil is old.  Very greasy and dense, not very good.  Big?  Yes but big doesn't always equate to \"good\" when eating.

Burger however was very nice, basically a bigger and better Harvey's style burger but for the price tag, really is a solid deal.

Chicken Souvlaki on a bun got the thumbs up, only complaint was the tzatziki wasn't strong enough.

One turn-off is they don't wear gloves when dressing your burger which I think at this point should be commonplace but to their defence, the poor woman helping us washed her hands three times between when we ordered and when we got our meal.

Would I go back?  Yes, but would try different sides.  Would I rush back?  No."}
{"text":"A Must Do while visiting Toronto.. Oh how I miss the Burger Shack. My last stint in Toronto I ate there every day of the week for 2 months. Its that good, and I was back last week, and nothing has changed. Perfection on a bun!

What can you do with a burger you say, well you can do this. Grilled burgers in their own juices on a well seasoned flat top, and an extensive condiment bar to custom build your juicy burger with, and thee best milkshakes in the known universe. I've tried to replicate their pineapple shakes many times with no luck. Check it out, it looks like a little hole in the wall and it is, but its one of the best burger joints in the world."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I'm not a burger gal and let me amend this preface by saying when I do eat burgers, I like them fried ala Mcdonald's so that they cease being burgers and transform into crispy foreign matter.  That said, the Burger shack is a real burger place for a real burger kind of person.  It is a classic, takeout spot on Eglinton offering delicious, large, grilled burgers.  

For those of us who prefer the kingdom Vegetalia to the kingdom Animalia, they also have a great Greek Salad and their French Fries are worth every clogged pore they may be causing in your bloated body."}
{"text":"All the 5-star reviews for this place are accurate if we're talking about burgers in Topaz.  But for the rest of us who are traveling through, and who this place clearly serves, I'd say these were average.  The burger was served hot and fresh, but the meat was a little short on flavor.  The fries were typical frozen steak-sized fries...  fresh-cut fries would be delicious here and bump this to 4.5 stars for me.

Also, they charge 75 cents for takeout.  First place I've seen that does that."}
{"text":"Burger Shack is neighborhood greasy spoon hamburger joint that is run by Greek immigrants. There isn't that many out there any more. In addition to hamburgers, they also serve souvlaki and other greek food.The restaurant decor is pretty run down and the service was gruff but efficient. The restaurant is always busy with many people driving in.

I ordered the homemade burger with the french fries and drink. The hamburger was good along with the french fries and drink. The only problem is that it cost $13.50 for everything.

Would I come back? I been here several times and the food has always been pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint for a family owned business. Burger was big and juicy.. really tasty."}
{"text":"Burger was good, poutine was really good (gravey was excellent), home made soup was very good as well... hits the spot when looking for a greqsy spoon place for a burger and fries.. will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular.  The burgers are fantastic! Bun to burger ratio is just right; burger patty is thick, homemade and juicy; ingredients are fresh... good prices and the onions rings are the best I've ever had. I don't go to revel in the ambience or to be flattered by the service... I go for the food and the burgers and fries/onion rings hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in toronto...it's super cheap for toronto prices and the food 'nd ingredient quality were outstanding..what else is there to ask for from a fast food joint? Would recommend to any and all! Plus their onion rings are some of the best I've ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Classic roadhouse burger joint complete with 70's vibe, untouched decor, folding seats and questionable characters. If you're in the area and just want a classic cheese burger, it's worth stopping by. The onion rings hit the traditional mark, but their poutine leaves a little to be desired. Fish and chips looked like a good choice, maybe another day."}
{"text":"Local joint that has been in the neighborhood forever. Great for a quick pickup, drop in or after bar food on the weekend. I always order homemade banquet burger and sometimes fried or poutine. Local establishment which even top chefs from around the city have been know to stop by (Mark McKewan and David Lee). Probably my favorite burger in the city, followed by Chuck or Priest or if were talking high end Allans on the Danforth. Shack is great at anytime of the day and would recommend it to anyone who isn't trying to compare it to the burgers at places like Bymark or One."}
{"text":"In our last few days living in Coleville, CA we decided to give the Burger Shack a shot. I popped in and sat at the bar top (it used to be a bar) and placed my order to go. I ordered two cheeseburger and fries meals. This place is run by a group of friendly ladies. As I sat I watched while they hand battered onion rings. They also serve hot dogs and fish and chips. Everything was packaged well for my short trip home. The burger was delicious and juicy and the bun was an awesome brioche bun!!!!  Don't ever change this Burger Shack!  Even the pickles were great. Service was quick and the prices are very reasonable. They also accept credit cards unlike Walker Burger."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want a fresh-never-frozen 6 oz. homemade burger. They make their own barbecue sauce as well, and offer hot sauce. Definitely go for the FRESH one, don't get the frozen one.

They have an extensive variety of drinks to choose from. Your regular Coca-Cola products, to San Pellegrino sodas, Arizona iced tea, Snapple, and a bunch of other random lesser-known drinks (like fruit nectars from Egypt and Israel). I ordered the Israeli mango nectar and it had a taste that was reminiscent of when I accidentally spray perfume in my mouth. It was $2.50 for a can. I wouldn't recommend it.

The banquet burger I ordered was delicious. Fresh patty, nice charcoal taste, fresh toppings, cheese and bacon. The burger came to about $6.

As for Yonge and Eglinton burger joints, I would definitely recommend this place over Gourmet Burger Co., McDonald's, Burger King, and Harvey's. South Street Burger is another good option in the area but this one is independent and charbroiled so I'd choose this place for sure."}
{"text":"Been a patron of the Burger Shack for over ten years. The burgers are consistently good, much better than the typical fast food joints. Fries and gravy are awesome, and their onion rings are huge! They also have the most extensive assortment of Canned pop. 
If you want a quick lunch or dinner at Yonge and Eglinton, drop in to the Burger Shack."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had since I can remember. The Angus beef here is some of the highest quality meat you'll find on a burger. The sauces that I tried were homemade. The bun was toasted just to my preference. Staff was extremely friendly and made sure we were taken care of. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"First time here my buddy Jay said this is the place to come to eat a good homemade burger combo fast service & not just burgers other great food on the menu definitely will come back here with friends & family. Thks to my buddy Jay this time he didn't order the kids meal he was hungry this time must had a busy morning because Jay ate like a champion. lol"}
{"text":"I LOVE the burger shack!  I live down the street and it's the perfect place for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late night craving!  I don't know many places where you can get eggs, bacon, toast, homefries and a coffee for $5.  Delicious too!  I miss the greasy dinner style breakfast!

As for the burgers, I recommend the homestyle banquet.  It's worth the extra money.  The homemade BBQ sauce along with the fried onions make this burger delicious.  From reading other reviews, it seems some people feel these are overdone, but I have NEVER had an overdone burger.

Highly recommend! But just bring cash cause there isn't any debit!"}
{"text":"I showed up on a Sunday evening at 7 pm, the place was still buzzing with customers. I ordered the Twin Burger, a side of fries and a can of pop and everything was finished quickly and done to perfection. The atmosphere feels like you've stepped back in time and it's a very cozy little space. Highly recommended if you are in the area and even worth a trek if you aren't close by."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast a couple days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. Super cheap fried egg sandwich with a full order of hash browns was under $8. Added some cheese, seasoned onions and a tomato - freaking perfect greasy breakfast. I've also had the fish and chips, pretty good for a burger joint! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto in late Jan 2012.  I was dissapointed to realize that the show \"Diners Drive-ins, and Dives\" had no Canadian restaurants.  I did a search for Canadian DDD's, and found this posting on Chowhound:

http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/619901

where Burger Shack was mentioned.

I went one night during the trip; I got the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  My American debit card wouldn't work in the ATM they have here, but thankfully they took US Dollars (at face value).  

The burger was good, but it tasted like spiced lamb, not beef.  It was a very interesting an pleasing taste.  The fries were very good.

No complaints, and I wish I lived closer so I could try more items.

Basically a step below a diner, but they do things very well."}
{"text":"You know when you crave those greasy burger, fries and want that staple in the city to go and find it. This is that place. 

Burgers are a great size and are always amazingly. Top it with some fries and gravy and you have a memorable diner experience. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give more than 5 stars! Comfortable atmosphere, speedy & friendly service, homemade flavor, amazing onion rings! I'm glad it's close to home so I can keep coming back!"}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant only takes cash? Step your game up. You would rather have an ATM to get even more money out of your customers. Well, I won't be a customer then. Smokes Craft Burger it is."}
{"text":"All things in moderation is not too bad for you, so I use to go there once a month - at best. I can't afford all the calories a homemade cheeseburger and onion rings can put on the old spare tire.
Burger Shack has been around all my life. They even opened one up, near where I grew up, but that one closed a loooooog time ago.
The homemade burgers are pretty good. The fries are standard stuff you get at a burger joint but the over-sized onion rings are very good. Again, it will clog your arteries if you have them on a regular basis. Lucky for me, I only can get there when I go downtown for meetings or I might be having a quadruple bypass. The souvlaki is a good choice too."}
{"text":"GREASY BURGERS AND FRIES! 

Things got sloppy.

PS. Have their milkshakes - it's fantastic."}
