{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have had. This is now our go to place when we don't want to cook. The food is authentic, lots of choices... Lovely restaurant, the staff gets 5 stars. They are both knowledgeable and very pleasant. Makes for a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"This place left a bad taste in my mouth and not just from the sub par food. Our waiter was unable to tell the difference between salmon and chicken and brought the wrong dish to our table. This itself isn't a huge deal but he proceeded to \"take care of tip\" by giving himself a  generous 19%. The service was slow and the food was mediocre. The restraunt does have a 15% gratuity policy but the menu explains its only for larger tables (8+). Irrelevant but they also had pictures of African elephants on there wall instead of Indian elephants."}
{"text":"Ate here recently for the first time and my party of four all found the food to be very tasty. The service was prompt and very friendly, appetizers and main course were delicious and spiced perfectly. Prices are reasonable and compare to other Thai restaurants we have visited in Ontario. I would recommend trying this restaurant if you haven't been before."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! It's a little pricey for Thai, but your taste buds will thank you! Love the peanut curry chicken with sticky rice and the basil chicken noodle or stir fry. 

We eat in here or order in pretty regularly. You can't go wrong. Their lunches are decent too. They offer a salad, soup, spring roll and smaller entree for like 9 bucks. The soup is a little congealy that you get, but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience! Great food, atmosphere and location. Definitely a place to check out even if you are not from Georgetown as you will get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Sophisticated, complex flavours that taste amazing. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the cuisine and are happy to explain the different dishes.  The Lemon Grass Soup was the best I have ever had
Portions are on the small size - you aren't likely to have leftovers but will not leave hungry.  
I will definitely be returning and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic as is the green curry chicken. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best Thai food in Halton Hills. I've lived in Toronto and it even beats out the majority of those. Favorite dishes include Papaya Salad (ask for extra spicy for Thai style), Drunken Noodles, Mango Red Curry with Coconut Rice, Spicy Chicken Wings and Cold Beef Salad. A bit on the pricey side with average sized portions but well worth it for the authenticity factor!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite places to eat in town!  Try the fresh veggie rolls and yellow curried chicken... yum!"}
{"text":"Staff are fabulous, food is great, but inconsistent.

I wouldn't recommend going here on the weekend as, it is very busy and the service wait  will be long. The last time I went on a Saturday I had to wait for 50 minutes for pad Thai that was still cold (I was too hungry to complain) . But the times before that when I went on a weekday I received quick service and the food was 20 times better.

Parking sucks because it's Main Street, can't fault them on that. 
The staff is great and very friendly, food is usually good."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and the food and service has been consistently great. Not just for a 'small town', but in general really fresh, good food. Also, and maybe I'm jinxing myself here, but they have *not once* gotten our order wrong. I have never been a regular customer of a restaurant where that's happened!  I also think the price is pretty good because the portions are very substantial. I have ordered pad thai for takeout and been able to eat it for 3 days."}
{"text":"Not bad - with so many other places around the gta with great Thai, this place is good if you're on Main St. and want a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. My wife and I have always done take out. One day I'll actually have to dine in. The best Thai sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"As a resident of Toronto with all he Thai food at my disposal, I have checked out several there, however nohing beats Georgetown Thai  on Main Street. Best ever."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. Ambience was really nice. For entree, we had Puff pastries which were nice. Yellow curry was delicious but the drunken noodles was a bit disappointing. It was really dry  and had no flavour. If we in the area, will have to try something different at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fine - but not 5 stars. The place is nice and clean, friendly service. But the food was almost mediocre. It didn't have the bold, assertive flavored that I love about Thai food. Instead, the flavors here are muted. My wife's plate had a bit of spice which was nice, but still very toned down. By no means what I would think of as medium spicy. It was mild. 
And I have to mention that while this place has vegetarian dishes like most Thai places, I cannot say that they are veg-friendly. Example: the lunch combo comes with a beef broth soup and no substitutions allowed. Just no soup for me. :("}
