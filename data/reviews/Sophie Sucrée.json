{"text":"First let me start off by saying that my rating is mostly based on the cupcakes, since I haven't tried anything else yet.   There aren't that many places that serve vegan desserts in Montreal, so Sophie Sucrée is definitely one of the most popular ones. The store itself has a nice vibe and cute décor, and the food looks beautiful... overall very instagrammable.   But moving on to the taste... I tried the black forest, vanilla, red velvet, and almond cupcakes. All the \"cake\" flavours were delicious and you could not even tell that they were vegan. Where they lose points is in the icing (in my opinion one of the most important parts). Instead of being creamy and fluffy it's like taking a bite of a stick of butter that has a weird taste. They need to step up their icing game."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! We ordered 2 cupcakes (they were having an awesome 2 for one deal), the carrot cake, and a cinnamon bun. The cupcakes were the red velvet and the chocolate with strawberry icing, and I would highly recommend both of them. Extremely moist and the frosting was delicious and tasted faintly of coconut. The cinnamon bun was good but a bit dry, and the carrot cake was so-so but had delicious chunks of walnut and raisins in it.   I also ordered a coffee and the chai rooibos tea. The way they serve beverages is really cute--there were mismatched cups and we had our own little teapot with an infuser. The employees working there even offered to give us more hot water for our teapot, which was really nice.  Overall, a really delicious experience, and a nice place to hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"Wow. Try the cheesecake. No, seriously, try the cheesecake. I was very reluctant to try it because, obviously, no dairy -- but I was completely wrong. Their goodies are pretty much consistently better than gluten & dairy ones I've had at other bakeries. If you're not vegan, no problem. I've had the pleasure of living above Sophie Sucree for the past few years and this little bakery was part of the reason I mustered up the courage to go vegan after a lifetime of eating meat and animal products. When I wasn't a vegan I still bought my sweets here."}
{"text":"Delicious treats. Its right by my work so it can be quite dangerous. Very friendly staff and inviting decor. At first I thought it was a little bit pricey but then realizing the ingredients for vegan desserts probably cost more, I understand why. You would never know its vegan, just as good as regular treats. I havent tried them yet but I hear the chocolate brownies are to die for."}
{"text":"We had a cinnamon bun and caramel hazelnut \"cheese\"cake. To die for! We'll be there for breakfast tomorrow.  A vegan's paradise."}
{"text":"After researching found this bakery for a birthday vegan cake. Great communications as I was ordering from the states. The cake itself was big success everyone loved it. It was vegan carrot cake customized with a minion on top. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"A tiny establishment on the plateau with a bit of a whimsical feel. I had the red velvet cupcake which I thought was decent. I wasn't a big fan of the frosting, which somehow managed to be both too sweet and too sour at the same time without the richness of the cream cheese coming through. Not sure if this is a new place but it feels like the menu can definitely use more fine tuning, especially in terms of the piece. A tiny cup of filter coffee was $2.50, same price as most cupcakes.  The place sits about 8 people, so definitely more of a walk-by-and-grab-a-cupcake-to-go kinda place."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff but one of the cheesecakes we bought tasted like pepto bismol. The other one was really good though, I think they used some kind of wine on the sauce."}
{"text":"Cute storefront, creative baked goods, friendly service. Sophie has it all. Cupcakes with original and tasty frostings, well-made cookies, stellar cinnamon rolls, outstanding brittle as well as cakes, tarts, etc. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai mon blog gourmand (la boufferie), j'essaie d'avoir le plus de primeur possible et c'est pourquoi, hier, j'étais présente au 167 des pins est pour l'ouverture de cette petite pâtisserie.  C'est super mignon comme endroit. Des cadres de toutes sortes décorent le mur d'entrée. Des fleurs fraîches et de la lavande séchée sont posées un peu partout. Des lampions dans des pots Masson apportent une ambiance paisible. Des pichets d'eau, du sucre et du lait sont posés sur un vieux buffet peint en blanc. Bref, c'est rustique, féminin et trop mignon.   L'endroit se spécialise en dessert bien qu'il est possible de prendre un petit repas léger comme des sandwichs. Les produits sont 100% végétalien et plus de la moitié est sans gluten. Il manquait justement d'endroit comme celui-ci à Montréal!   Mes coups de coeur: les sablés au citron et les tartelettes aux bleuets et caramel.   L'endroit vend également, en boules ou en plus grande quantité, des crèmes glacées végétaliennes faites par le traîteur Sel noir. Essayez cette citron & basilic, c'est rafraîchissant à souhait et donc, parfait pour l'été!   Sur leur site internet, il vous sera également possible de voir des photos de leurs gâteaux de mariage qui sont tout simplement sublime et tellement élégants!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Flavourful and fresh deserts. I still think about the fall tart/pie! It was so warming and just the right amount of sweetness. Love the presentation and detail."}
{"text":"Had two cupcakes and found both to be flavorful yet crumbly. Service was friendly but a bit slow. Was tempted by the sundae but seemed a bit small for the price so had to pass. I would recommend if you happen to be in the area and really need to crush a sweet tooth but not necessarily for a special trip."}
{"text":"Just walking into this place had me smiling. I was so shocked at how perfect each pastry looked. They looked as if they'd been posed for a magazine, so beautiful!   I went for the cinnamon bun and a cup of coffee. I ordered confidently in French but I'm sure I must've sounded awful! Sophie was so friendly and non-judgemental about my French. The pastry and the coffee were wonderful. My friend and I stayed for a while, taking advantage of the sweet and welcome atmosphere. Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another great discovery.  I ordered cupcakes to go for my birthday and decided to sit down a minute and enjoy one or two on the spot. All the flavours were delicious, moist and not overly sweet.  It's been so hard finding great and moderately priced vegan cupcake in Montreal.  I hope they add macaroons to their menu soon. I look forward to going back again so I can try their cookies and carrot cake.  I can't wait to take my non-vegan friends, just so they can experience these delicious treats.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to vegans AND non-vegans."}
{"text":"got a dozen cupcakes as a gift and they are super yummy! we have a variety of flavours and all of them so far are flavourful & delicious. also super cute"}
{"text":"A very cute dessert shop with vegan things. It's pretty small, but they have a decent selection of sweets. I got a pecan pie type deal, and it was good, but a little too sweet."}
{"text":"Delicious and adorable! You don't have to be vegan to indulge in what Sophie Sucree has to offer. Excellent service, tea, and treats! The spiced cupcake was the best I've ever had. Just thinking about it almost makes me want to drive all the way back up there to get some more.  Also tried a chocolate tarty thing with caramel and sea salt... Whoa. Their cookies are great too! Worth stopping in and giving it a try."}
{"text":"I have changed from a vegetarian diet to a plant based only diet very recently.  I must say I was missing my daily scone.  But I feel better now that I found Sophie Sucree!!   They offer some pretty yummy vegan baked goods.  I tried three different scone flavors, and they were all good. The banana bread is also delicious.  I also find out they have their baked goods are available to include in the Lufa farms boxes!   The shop is cute, decorated with vintage tables and chairs, very sweet. The staff is friendly and helpful, and prices are fair.  Scones from the day before are half price, and they taste just as good."}
{"text":"I picked up a fantastic gluten-free vegan cake for a friend's birthday. It was rich, and dense, and lovely!"}
{"text":"Great cupcakes, pleasant ambience, a lil gem of a place!  I first got their cupcakes through their partnership with Lufa Farms.  The next weekend i went there on my own for more cupcake goodness! :)  My only complaint is that i am on the other side of the city, but probably it's for the best for my diet ;) i'd definitely be eating more than i need to"}
{"text":"If you love cupcakes, you should definitely come here!! I didn't even realize they were vegan until I actually saw a sign that said all products made in Sophie Sucrée were vegan. Their frosting is very light and just hits the spot. They have many flavours ranging from earl grey to oreo! The cupcakes are sold at a decent price at about $2.50 per cupcake. You can also buy packs of 6 for $12 or $6 when they go on sale. This is a very cute cafe and great place to study if you are studying alone or with one other person!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim, hoping to assuage my craving for strawberry tart. Strawberry tarts, french strawberry tarts to be exact, are an orgasmic profusion of tender sweet fruit, light delicate custard, and a sweet crunchy crust, topped with the finest strawberry glaze. Alas, finding a vegan strawberry tart proved too difficult.  There are not many vegan bakeries in Montreal but we found this one. We went hoping to find a decent substitute. I did not like the cherry cheesecake. Tasted like firm tofu. Their chocolate chip cookies were pretty delicious. Charming aesthetic, kind service. I'd come here again to try their other desserts, but I wish they had strawberry tart."}
{"text":"Had an awesome gluten free cookie from here this summer that tasted super normal and we were even wondering if it was really g-free and vegan!  Way to go!"}
{"text":"Small shop with stock of fresh cheesecakes, cookies for that sudden craving after lunch!"}
{"text":"Very small place with delicious pastries. Only a few seats available inside so don't expect to have a table there to chill with friends."}
{"text":"À la découverte des saveurs sucrées végétaliennes qu'offre Montréal?  Cette boutique est l'adresse que tu cherches!  L'intérieur est petit composé de deux tables pour 4 personnes mais le plus important se trouve sous le grand comptoir de pâtisseries. Retrouvez scones, cupcake, muffins, biscuits, etc etc avec des goûts subtils et des textures parfaites!   On ne peut pas faire de gâteaux sans casser d'ufs? Et bien chez Sophie c'est possible et c'est bon :)"}
{"text":"My second visit - the first was in May 2014 - and Sophie Sucrée has only gotten better. A much wider selection of delights available (cupcakes, feuillétés, cookies, cakes). Open late on Thursday evenings. Only a few tables available but the flow of customers seems to be balanced. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very cute little store with friendly staff and a variety of gluten-free options. The iced coffee was not half bad either. A great addition to Ave Des Pins."}
{"text":"On vient d'avoir le pire service que quelqu'un peut avoir en tant que client: - On rentre, pas de bonjour.  - On demande s'il y a des allergènes dans leurs chocolats de Pâques, elle répond \" OUI \" sans faire aucune autre proposition... - Lorsqu'on commande la fille est très bête, ne nous regarde pas... (en passant il n'y avait personne, donc ce n'est pas parce qu'ils étaient occupés, chose que j'aurais pu comprendre) - Lorsque je paie, elle ne me donne pas la machine pour mettre ma carte... donc j'insère ma carte, elle sort ma carte et la met sur la table ?!  - J'attends qu'elle me dit quand je peux la réinsérer, elle ne dit rien et elle soupire pis met la carte elle-même  - Avant de sortir on lui dit merci, elle ne nous répond pas!   C'est dommage parce qu'on aimait aller là, mais avec cette expérience on ne reviendra plus!"}
{"text":"My sister and her boyfriend brought Vegan cupcakes home for my mom's birthday. Honestly, I could not tell the difference between any of the ingredients! The cupcakes were moist, Perfect vegan \"butter cream\" icing! We tried the chocolate, dulces leches with almonds, black Forest, Oreo and vanilla. I will definitely consider this place for a future pit stop bakery to cover my sweet tooth cravings! Highly recommended for non- vegans as well, the \"healthier\" cupcake option!"}
{"text":"the service was friendly and efficient. i highly recommend the spinach scone. the apple turnover was also delicious."}
{"text":"got a double chocolate cupcake and the banana chocolate nut loaf and oh my goodness so delicious... I really wish I didn't live five hours away from this place :'( I would eat there everyday!!"}
{"text":"Of course her name is Melody.   The girl behind the counter, with her songlike sounds spoken softly in that enchanting accent, welcomes rain-soaked sweet-seekers to the small bakery and house of treats in Montreal. They come expecting cupcakes, cookies, and brownies, but the real sweetness emanates from the smile she offers to each visitor.   Should you find yourself nearby, of course the dulce de leche cupcake, miniature pecan pies, or the storied banana bread will certainly fill your stomach and your mind with happiness, but come in, sit down, and enjoy the melodies and it will fill your soul. A sweet (vegan) dessert shop you visit once, but keep with you for a long time afterwards."}
{"text":"J'y suis allez lors de l'ouverture et y suis retourné quelques semaines plus tard pour voir comment ça roulais. Et bien tout roule.  Leurs petites pâtisseries vegan sont supers bonnes, les saveurs sont variées.  Je sais qu'ils font aussi des sandwiches pour le midi mais je n'ai pas eu l'occasion d'y goûter.  La décoration est vraiment cute, petits meubles avec miroirs et cadres, des vases fleuris et pots massons.  Il y a aussi 4 petites tables si vous voulez profiter un peu de l'ambiance en dégustant une de leurs spécialités.  Le service est vraiment parfait et je n'ai rien à redire, Être accueilli avec un grand sourire et un beau \"Bonjour\" que demander d'autre?"}
{"text":"Great vegan bakery/cafe with gluten free options.  Best know for their cupcakes, they also make some amazing cookies, brownies, tarts, banana bread, muffins and scones.  You must try the spinach turnovers when you're there.  They also customize cakes plus make truffles."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan cakes and dessert items! Tastes better than other bakeries who use dairy ingredients.  A little bit sugar-y - but not necessarily more than other bakeries."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit in this adorable cafe. I had planned to stop in and grab a cup of coffee, but was taken aback by the elegance and charm of this little gem. The pastries are all beautiful and elegant, I immediately vowed to try them all, even if it meant a daily pilgrimage to Sophie Sucrée.  The atmosphere is so friendly and wonderful - I decided that this is the kind of place where I can sit and read books and do emails all day. While I do this, I'm enjoying a fantastic cup of coffee with coconut cream, and a sumptuous carrot cake that crumbles in my mouth with the gentleness and sweetness of a lover's embrace. Ok, a pretentious metaphor like that means I might have fallen in love. With what? The beautiful, smiling pastry server? The cake? The cafe itself? All of it.  Don't miss out on your chance for dietary romance - visit Sophie Sucrée."}
{"text":"My friend ordered a gluten-free cake for my birthday and it was incredible! Dense but not dry, sweet without being over-the-top, and beautifully decorated. The icing was coconut oil based - very rich and delicious. We had originally planned to just stop by and pick up the cake, but the cafe was so nice that we stayed to drink coffee and eat some of it there. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Sophie Sucrée is perhaps the best little vegan-gluten-free bakery anywhere in the world! I came here with a friend and we had a blast sampling cupcakes! You must try the almond and cranberry cupcake and the Earl Grey will knock your socks off. We also fell in love with the chocolate and red velvet. The frosting is to die for! WONDERFUL!!!"}
{"text":"Ça faisait un moment que j'avais envie de tester Sophie Sucrée, l'occasion ne s'étant jamais présentée j'ai enfin pu goûter une de leurs pâtisseries au festival végan de Montréal. J'ai craqué pour un brownie choco-noix de coco tout à fait délicieux. Maintenant il va falloir aller en boutique pour tester d'autres pâtisseries."}
{"text":"Tiny little hole in the wall,(only 2 small tables), patisserie specialising in gluten-free , vegan desserts.  I thought I'd have one of their scrumptious -looking cinnamon buns  I spotted encased in a glass cake keeper.It was upon closer examination that I noticed  the keeper was encasing a swarm of bugs as well as buns. Sorry,had to leave."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a great little bakery in Montreal. My husband is gluten free so we came here to get some pastries and coffee one morning. They have not just one GF option, but MANY GF options. He was in heaven! We have been here several times since our first visit and we've tried many things including the pecan tarts, pumpkin tarts, spinach scones, cranberry scones, GF chocolate cookies, and others. Everything is delicious.   One little word of caution.. If you order a coffee, don't forget this is a vegan place so you can't get dairy creamer or milk. Just coconut milk, almond milk, or soy milk."}
{"text":"A great vegan bakery that I would probably try to go to every time I visit Montreal. I heard about and had to check out out, and I wasn't disappointed, not by the tea that I got in a kattle (and had enough for about 3 cups), nor by the brownie and muffin I ordered."}
{"text":"Wonderful little store. Adorable shabby chic decorations. Very helpful and generous staff. Had a chocolate au paprika, date ball. Got a double chocolate cookie for later. Husband had a 5 spice (cinnamon) bun. So many options it was hard to choose!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get my 25th wedding anniversary cake from.  I saw that Sophie Sucre had really good reviews.  I made an appointment for a cake tasting and went with my daughter and daughter in law.  We were blown away by how delicious everything Milene brought out for us to taste.   She told us how she makes her frostings and said she used coconut oil for her base.  Because I can be dense, it wasn't until she asked if I was vegan and I said no and was wondering why she asked me that question that  it dawned on me... Her stuff is all vegan.  We were speechless.  I had not noticed that her bakery was vegan.  I told her had I noticed I would never have given her place a second glance.  After all... How good could \"vegan\" cakes be???? Well we found out! I can't speak for every vegan bakery but for \"Sohie Sucree\" vegan cake is out of this world!!! And to top it off she does gorgeous hand painted cake decorating which I fell in love with. My initial idea was for a naked cake but when is saw her hand painted cakes I knew that was exactly what I wanted.   So after much second guessing myself wondering if I was just caught up in a moment  and wondering if it really were that good... (It was!!) I placed my order.  I can not say enough about how delicious our cake was.  4 tiers chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and almond cake with caramel frosting.... I could bathe in the caramel frosting it's sooooo delicious.  And the wonderful thing about her cakes and cupcakes is that after you eat one you are not left with that heavy kinda sick feeling from to much sweet frosting and cake.  It just settles so well you don't even feel guilty for going in for seconds.  And just so you know.. Her brownies, cheesecake bites and her cinnamon rolls are equally delicious.  Believe me... I will drive the 1.5 hrs just to get me my Sophie Sucree fix!!!"}
{"text":"Après un brunch nous venons ici pour finir sur une touche sucrée et nous avons bien eu raison. Le principe est d'avoir des pâtisseries végan et parfois sans gluten. Nous avons pris un scone citron-lavance, un scone canneberge-pacane et un muffin bleuet-érable. Il s'agissait de produits de la veille qui sont donc à moitié prix. Pour moins de 6 dollars nous avons donc pu goutter ces 3 items ce qui vaut vraiment le coup ! J'ai beaucoup aimé ce que nous avons mangé, j'ai trouvé que les goûts étaient bien équilibrés. Bonne découverte de cette petite boutique où l'on peut tranquillement se poser pour une petite pause sucrée."}
{"text":"After an intense day of shopping, I decided to stop at this little coffee shop which offers a variety of vegan baked goods for some coffee and much needed sugar. I debated at the counter since I've heard so much about their cupcakes but ended up taking the chocolate tartelette, and a latte. I sat by the window on one of the mismatched tables and got to work! The girl warned me that the ganache is very rich, which I have no issue with, and indeed the filling was incredibly flavourful and had this great texture; unfortunately the crust felt short and broke down into ashes when my fork went through. The coffee was good, perfectly tempered almond milk too. I liked the cosy feel of the space and the service was great and very welcoming. I haven't written this spot off completely as I intend to try they famous cupcakes someday but not a fan of their little tarts"}
{"text":"Yummy vegan cupcakes, and the shop has a lovely, warm feeling to it. The scones were too sweet for my taste, but I would definitely go back for the vanilla or almond cupcakes. I was so grateful to them for having water easily accessible for my thirsty kid too."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée une fois pour goûter à leurs pâtisseries, leurs cupcakes vegans étaient à tomber. Alors pour mon anniversaire je leur ai demandé un gâteau un peu spécial mais dans leurs cordes. Non seulement la personne avec qui j'ai communiqué par courriel a été d'une extrême patience et gentillesse mais en plus le gâteau était excellent. Il ressemblait parfaitement à ma demande tant au niveau de l'aspect que pour la saveur.  Et tous les invités ont été ravis, qu'il s'agisse de personnes Veganes ou non. Bref, c'est sans aucun doute que j'y retournerais que ce soit pour déguster une de leurs pâtisseries ou pour recommander un gâteau pour un événement spécial."}
{"text":"Im so glad I live 2min away from this place! The pastries are better than nonvegan ones!! Cupcakes are delicious, and surprisingly not expensive at all for vegan ones!! I didn't like the cheesecake, but Sophie Sucree is a really cool place and 100 %worth trying"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to desserts:) The place was pretty easy to find and it was the most adorable bakery I've been in so far! The girl at the counter was friendly. I ordered a coffee, chocolate cupcake, and brownie. The brownie was pretty poor in taste. I was pretty disappointed but the cupcake was delicious for a vegan cupcake! It was moist, light, and not overly sweet:) The coffee was sub par but I won't rate them on their coffee. I would come back here again for just the cupcakes or perhaps to try another dessert. The cakes they make look beautiful so I'm sure they are great for weddings!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit bien sympathique, pour des desserts vegans c'est un bon \"spot\", l'ambiance est très convivial, les tables rétro font le look de l'endroit. J'ai pris un simple sablé à la lavande et un thé Earl Grey. Les prix étaient très raisonnable et j'avais une quantité phénoménal de délicieux thé pour moins que 3$."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for some afternoon tea. I love sweets and vegan desserts are quite hard to find. But this place has so many different vegan desserts, such as cupcake, cheesecake, brownie, cinnamon roll, scone, cookies, and other things too. I got a hazelnut seal salt brownie, and my friend got a caramel cheesecake. They were both so delicious. The brownie was dense and chocolatey. The cheesecake really tasted like a real cheesecake, but lighter. My friend isn't vegan but loved both desserts. Whether you are vegan or not, these desserts are so good! There is also a good selection of tea and coffee. However, there are only like two tables if you want to sit down, but i noticed lots of people come in and out to just buy and take away."}
{"text":"All the food here is amazing! At this point I tried everything at the store. The place is a perfect spot for catching up. Also a lot of gluten free for those who needs them.  Only reason why I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is for the coffee."}
{"text":"From the US here, and have many food allergies. I was looking for a dairy free (soy free and oat free) pastries place and found this one on yelp. I got here right when it opened and the staff were nice and friendly. I got a croissant, chocolate tarte, and caramel brownie. Let me tell you, the croissant was so delicious and crispy I nearly cried when I ate it. I haven't had a real croissant in years because of my dairy allergy. This croissant was absolute perfection and I regret not buying more than one. I also regret not buying the cronut and almond croissant that other people said they bought."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan desserts! They even have gluten free options! I love the almond croissant!   The place needs an upgrade...And the staff needs to be more approachable."}
{"text":"This place is super cute!!! However, it's super small and cramped and I found it difficult to really sit down and relax in the café. Also, I ordered the banana bread and it was rather dry and mediocre. Definitely worth coming to try out what vegan desserts are like, but I would choose a non-vegan place over this place."}
{"text":"Very rare to find a vegan bakery that does it well! And boy do they! I ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake for my mom's birthday. It was moist and just the right amount of sweetness. The cake was steep however being 40 for serving size of about 8-10people. Nonetheless, it hit the spot."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite bakeries. Everything there is so tasty, and I love the fact that it's vegan and healthier. One helpful tip to remember is that they always have cupcakes, cookies, everything left over from the day before at half price. Their prices on regular items are so reasonable that the half-price, day after, makes it even more worthwhile."}
{"text":"La ville de Montréal est chanceuse d'avoir sa propre pâtisserie entièrement végane! Ici, pas de produit issu de l'exploitation animale. On peut donc se laisser tenter par une gâterie ou 2 avec la conscience tranquille (sauf, peut-être, si vous êtes du genre à compter les calories!)  Sans le savoir, vous êtes peut-être déjà familier(ère) avec Sophie Sucrée: leurs nombreux desserts et viennoiseries sont de plus en plus populaires et on en retrouve dans plusieurs marchés, cafés et restaurants végétariens et/ou végétaliens. Même si l'atelier est surtout apprécié pour ses cupcakes, on retrouve aussi des brownies, des biscuits, des tartelettes, des brioches, des scones, des muffins, des truffes et différentes saveurs de pain aux bananes. Si vous avez la dent sucrée, c'est donc une destination de choix! Quelques options salées limitées sont également disponibles (p. ex. feuilleté aux épinards). À noter également que l'ensemble des ingrédients utilisés dans les différentes confections est listé sur le site web officiel. J'apprécie la transparence! Gardez toutefois en tête que l'atelier ne compte que quelques places assises (environ une dizaine) donc privilégiez les commandes à emporter. Par contre, si vous arrivez à avoir une place, l'établissement est agréable et offre une grande sélection de thés. La décoration est composée de blanc et de rose et \"fit\" avec ce qu'on s'attend d'une pâtisserie majoritairement connue pour ses cupcakes.  Au passage, Sophie Sucrée prend également en charge des commandes spéciales pour des gâteaux et offre, lors du temps des Fêtes, au moins 2 bûches de Noël. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Le paradis des végétaliens gourmands est à Sophie Sucré ! J'ai testé différents cupcake ainsi que des muffins et tout était excellent et en plus vraiment pas très cher.  On peut consommer sur place bien que je trouve que l'endroit est peu propice à cela car l'endroit est assez petit, il y a donc peu de place assises, et il n'y a pas de wifi donc impossible d'y venir avec son ordinateur et d'y travailler,...ce qui est un peu dommage.  On peut également faire des commandes de gâteaux (ou de bûches pour noël) ce que je trouve super si on veut quelque chose de plus élaboré ou tout simplement nul en cuisine."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite bakery in town because everything is 100% vegan, and most things are even gluten-free. They also serve breakfast, which is pretty cool. All of their desserts taste amazing, and you can't even tell that they're vegan and/ or gluten-free.   The store itself is super cute and there are a few tables inside incase you want to enjoy a dessert and coffee indoors.  My reason for the 4 star rating is because once I ordered in advance for my friend's birthday, and when I went into the store to pickup my order I was informed that they didn't accommodate my request. It was a bit frustrating considering that I ordered 2 weeks in advance and no one informed me that there was a problem. Other than that...best bakery in town!"}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je voulais tester Sophie Sucrée, appâtée par le tas d'avis positifs que j'avais lus sur Yelp. Tout compte fait, je m'en serais bien passée.  La boutique, salon de thé girly avec sa porcelaine et son mur de cadres photos gourmandes, surfe sur la tendance végane et sans gluten. Les ingrédients se veulent frais, biologiques et locaux. Cupcakes, biscuits, brownies, brioches, muffins, tartelettes,... ce n'est pas le choix qui manque. En plus des bas prix de base, les invendus de la veille sont bradés à -50 %.   Quel enchantement à la découverte de cet univers... jusqu'à ce que je passe la dégustation. Problème évident d'équilibre. Le scone citron-lavande de mon amie Hellen avait été noyé dans la lavande, alors que mon muffin érable-bleuets sans gluten avait été noyé dans l'érable. Et ne parlons pas de mes cupcakes épices et cassonade au glaçage dulce de leche, qui s'apparentaient plutôt à une recette de ménagère de gâteau au yaourt surmonté d'une crème grossièrement compacte. Conclusion, ça casse pas trois pattes à un canard."}
{"text":"Sophie Sucrée is a small vegan pastry shop in view of Mont Royal. We read the menu beforehand and were looking forward to the spinach \"feta\" puffs, turnovers, and more. We were not disappointed at all. We shared a number of items, including a pecan torte, a chocolate torte, and an almond bun. Each was delightful. The staff person then brought us over a dish of mango ice cream that the chef wanted us to try. Wow! So delicious and creamy. She came back again with some pieces of banana bread that were too small to sell. Holy smokes was this our lucky day. We couldn't finish it all. We boxed up the banana breads, and bought three more spinach puffs to go.  Can't recommend Sophie Sucrée highly enough."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a Vegan but my life-partner is. So when she had a birthday and I needed a Vegan cake I knew this is the spot for me. Their products might be a little more pricey the diary containing products but you need to remember they use more expensive ingredients and they are not making huge quantities so you will get fresh and quality products.   The cake they made was amazing, all the kids loved it, all the adults ate it noting was left and no one even noticed its diary free...yes that good."}
{"text":"A friend brought some of these cupcakes and mentioned they were vegan. I was excited because I've heard so many great things about this place. However, when you take a bite it's just a terrible cupcake. It tastes only of oil, especially the icing! I bake often and have successfully made tasty vegan cupcakes. These are the worst I've ever tasted. In fact, my stomach hurts from all the oil in these cupcakes :("}
{"text":"The owner was very welcoming and the apple turnover was delicious! I love that everything in there is vegan and she doesn't use tofu in her products!!!!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate that Montréal has a vegan bakery as charming and tasty as this one. I've tasted what I like to think as a healthy variety of their cookies, cupcakes and squares and I've generally been rather pleased. And trust me, I've eaten A LOT of vegan baked goods.  The last couple of times I've visited the majority of patrons coming in and out are folks clearly just \"picking up the vegan dessert\" for a soirée. While I think that's marvellous that this is something Sophie Sucrée offers I would love to encourage folks to try and grab one of the cute vintage tables in there and enjoying the space a bit- it's typically very sunny, the tea is lovely and served in vintage tea cups. Basically it's adorable.  The only star-loser that I feel is worth mentioning is that the red velvet recipe could totally be improved upon. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's heavy on the oil-taste. Maybe try coconut oil next time? Just a thought."}
{"text":"An adorable shop! The ambiance alone is enough to make me want to go back. But the most amazing thing about Sophie Sucrée is that their goodies are vegan and often times gluten free! I am really impressed with their cupcakes. The flavors are plentiful and seem to change a lot and the cake of the cupcake is lovely. It isn't crumbly or mushy like some vegan cakes are. And the 'less fresh' cupcakes are only $5 for 6! What a bargain! I love this place and can't wait to go for tea someday!"}
