{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED but there is completely new ownership and an entirely new menu that is very unpleasing. We miss you Winnie"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when my hubby was out of town and I wasn't feeling well.  Great pricing, close to home and they deliver!  The egg rolls are HUGE, you get twice as many crab rangoon as other places and the fried rice seems homemade, just made, fresh.  

The first time I ordered delivery they said 45 min.  Totally fine.  It was a busy night.  They showed up in 15.  

The second time we thought they were closing soon and felt bad ordering for delivery.  The gentleman said it wasn't a problem.  They expanded their hours as they are continuing to get busier and busier.  

This is def our new spot!"}
{"text":"First went here 2 years ago and thought it was fabulous. Their Orange Chicken was amazing and they also included Egg Drop Soup, Friend Shrimp, and an Egg Roll with every order (for dinner or lunch). Decided to visit them again and got the same exact order and was highly dissatisfied. The chicken tasted like it was from a can and was overly cooked (I could taste burnt crispy parts, yuck!). They also no longer give you the Fried Shrimp. The Egg Roll was super small and tasted like it had previously been frozen. The WORST part about the entire experience was that when I was waiting for my order I went to the restroom and immediately saw a giant cockroach scurrying around the floor! No thank you. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Some days you just want that go-to delicious delivery Chinese food. This fits the bill. We love the orange chicken and chow mein but really everything is good. Delivery usually runs 30-40 minutes and the delivery person is always kind and pleasant. Order online, they have pretty good free-dish deals thru their website."}
{"text":"I ordered the Crab Puffs, wonton soup, and orange chicken with fried rice. I hate to give a bad review but I'm so tired of being disappointed in the Chinese food in Phoenix! I can only speak to what I ordered:

Crab Puffs - should be called cream cheese puffs. There was no crab whatsoever. 

Wonton soup - loaded with veggies, decent. 

Orange chicken - again decent flavor with thin sliced chicken/lightly breaded.

Fried rice had a funny taste...nothing about it was \"fried\" or authentic. 

I give them two stars because they were friendly and quick to deliver. The food was disappointing and I ended up throwing it away after a few bites."}
{"text":"Oh my God, this place is stupid good!
My boyfriend and I just bought a house a few minutes away and we were looking for the best local Chinese place for us to settle into and OH. MY. GOD. did we hit the jackpot.
I know it sounds a hyperbolic but this is hands down the best Chinese food place I have eaten at in my life.
When you order a dinner combination, it comes with SO MUCH FOOD for your money. Egg roll, two fried shrimp, a bowl of soup and a side of rice with your entree (on which they certainly do not skimp.) The sides alone almost make a full meal and they are so delicious. A little on the greasy side but you'll hear no complaints from me (the stuff is /fried/, after all).
The soup is the best egg drop soup I've ever had. Thick and meaty, not a bowl of water with a few slivers of egg like I've had at many other places. Thick and hearty with a nice amount of egg and chicken.
The egg roll is HUGE compared to the average egg roll and also plenty meaty, not just a fried cabbage pocket.
Rice is hot and fresh and delicious.
Of the entrees, we've tried the cashew shrimp, orange chicken and sesame chicken and all three of these were completely perfect. Large portions make it well worth the money (about $9-$10 for the dinner combos) and they taste amazing! The cashew shrimp was both savory and creamy at the same time and there was no shortage of shrimp. Sesame chicken was fluffy and juicy and delicious. Orange chicken is, quite literally, the very best orange chicken I have ever had. Deliciously saucy without being overpowering and the chicken slightly crispy which kicks the flavor up just that much more.
The atmosphere is nothing to write home about. It's modest but clean and well-kept with a peppering of decoration here and there. Very casual and relaxed which is certainly not a negative for me.
The service is pretty casual but definitely friendly. Both times we've been here there have been employees cracking jokes with each other behind the counter but not behaving in any way inappropriately and treating us very respectfully and being sure to keep checking on our needs. I have no problem whatsoever with people enjoying themselves at work provided it doesn't interfere with the service and it definitely didn't.

We are really excited about this place and have invited so many people to come eat there with us once we're settled in to the new house. We took home a menu today to put on the fridge for nights that we can't be bothered to cook or go out so they can be our first choice for some delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered the Walnut Chicken in a sweet cream sauce. It was very disappointing. The chicken is deep-fried pieces and ok. The walnuts are cold and the sauce is not sweet and has the consistency and taste of mayonnaise. It was also served in a tortilla bowl. I did not understand that. There was rice as a side and it was not sticky rice. Very bland. The Pepsi did not even taste right. I am not going back."}
{"text":"I love their crab puffs! They are so light and crispy, and never too greasy. 
I try to get something new each time I come, although I love their curry, and the porc mi fun. 
I go here almost once a week for a quick dinner, and have never been disappointed. 
The staff are courteous and remember the special orders I get, such as adding veggies to dishes, and removing the mushrooms from others."}
{"text":"We have had food delivered from these guys on many occasions and it is ALWAYS delicious. The portions are healthy and service is timely. There was even an instance that they forgot sauce for one of our entrees and they immediately brought a huge container of the sauce out. We live quite a distance from the restaurant and were very grateful. In addition to generous portions the food is always well presented. We are so happy to finally have a decent Chinese take-out in our area!"}
{"text":"We recently tried The Wok Express since it is right down the street and wish we had tried it sooner. The ordering process online was so easy, delivery was fast, and the food was fresh and delicious. The portions were large even when we got the small sizes. Some of the best Orange Chicken I have had."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! So was the price! Lunch was $5.75 for soup egg roll rice and entree."}
{"text":"Been here handful of times over the past few years have only had minor issues (putting veggies in a dish specified with \"no vegetables\") other than that, the food is delicious and you pretty much get what you pay for, the food is kinda pricy but you get pretty big proportions. service is friendly enough, you can also call in your order if you wanna pick up your order when you get their or are in a hurry. the actually eating area of the store looks clean but when i glanced over the counter in the back it looked awful, (food splatters, water all over the floor) but im no health inspector and it was before closing. 

also, the teriyaki chicken is AWESOME with white rice! 

Conclusion, if you have enough cash and want some good chinese food definitely go here to get it!"}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants are usually synonymous with bad customer service. Well, that's not true for The Wok Express. Food is excellent, very consistent most of the time. Customer service is top notch! 
You won't find a better deal around Phoenix area for Chinese takeouts."}
{"text":"Before they switched to this new owner they were a lot better.. The foods OK.  Nothing to get all excited over."}
{"text":"I like to get the lettuce wraps for lunch/dinner.  The filling is tasty on its own, and there is plenty for two meals.  Sometimes I will eat half with the lettuce, and then eat the other half with rice the next day."}
{"text":"Good food but the customer service is horrible, I have been waiting for 30 minutes for my take out, the two people that came in after me have already got their food and left. Not happy."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Work Express tonight.  Their sauces are excellent, taste home made, not to sweet and perfectly blended.  Vegetables are steamed perfectly with a bit of crunch and not overcooked.  Restaurant is clean, well kept and the service is quite prompt.  We will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS! Love the family staff :) friendly atmosphere and very clean. Delivery is super fast and always correct as long as you ask for the item you want, never expect it, just ask ;) My husband and I eat there weekly."}
{"text":"Singapore Mei Fun Noodles were excellent.  Portions are generous, the place is clean and the service is friendly.  Great place to have in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Are 2nd time here.. The sweet & sour shrimp is to die for... We drove all the way from the Az mills with traffic just for the shrimp!!!!!  The average lg plate for 2 is $9.. While the small plate is around $6.. Hot tea is only $1 and they bring u a medium size bowl. The cooks are fast.. food is deliver hot and fresh!!! Best Damn place for Chinese.. The shrimp had TONS of favlor,with lots onions,pineapple,carrots and there red sweetsauce.. The lady is very friendly.. I strongly recommend u try this place for urself..  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best CHINESE!!!! Could eat this every Friday after work and again for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I've been living nearby for years and just found out about this place, I didn't realize they had tofu! It was pretty good! Probably not the healthiest thing for dinner but I enjoyed it. Orange tofu with brown rice, next time I'll ask for veggies!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience tonight. It was our first try at The Wok Express. When we ordered, the gentleman was friendly enough. But, he took our order wrong. We clearly said we wanted Walnut SHRIMP and he rang up chicken. We got our food and did not realize the mistake until we took a bite. (We were sharing) I went up to the counter and asked a woman (who was clearly the manager) if she wanted us to give back the chicken since we had already bitten into it. We wanted shrimp and I explained to her that the cashier must have rang it up incorrectly. She abruptly said that yes, she wanted it back, and that I must pay the difference. It was only ONE DOLLAR so I asked her why I had to pay the difference if it wasn't my fault they rang it up wrong. I told her we were in a hurry, were hungry, and needed to go and this was sort of making us late. 

I didn't mind paying the difference, but I thought I would just ask why I had to pay it if it wasn't my fault. I was really nice about it and assumed that most places would want to please the customer or make up for the mistake somehow. Instead, this woman snapped at me. She said \"Well I have to charge you and no, you can't keep the old one. I can't just give it to you. So you pay the $1.85.\" She was raising her voice and seemed really agitated. So I said \"I thought I would just ask because this wasn't our fault and now we have to wait for a new one.\" SHe looked at me and said \"Well, you can pay for it or you can have the cashier pay for it? Hmm? How about I have him pay for your whole meal and that way you can get it free??\" At this point, she was downright angry. I told her that there was no need to have him pay for it and that I felt bad making him do that. I calmly just told her that she was making me uncomfortable so I'd pay for it, but that I probably wasn't coming back to eat there since they treat their customers so poorly. Her reply? \"Fine, I can refund you the entire meal and you don't come back and you can leave!\" 

At this point, I felt really awkward so I just gave her my money and said my kids were hungry, we were hungry, and I needed to just eat. She took it and proceeded to run back to the cooking area and YELL in Chinese and point to me. She was yelling! She was clearly so angry at me. I felt SOOOOO uncomfortable and was really shocked that she was being so rude to me. 

After we ate we noticed the cashier, who was stocking the drink station, and told him we were sorry. We weren't trying to get him in trouble or make him pay and knew it was just an honest mistake. He seemed fine and was very nice, but I will NEVER go there again. Anywhere that makes me feel THAT uncomfortable will not receive my business. Maybe I should have just paid the difference, but for some reason I expected a little customer service. Especially since the chicken was gross and we wanted shrimp. 

To end my review, I will say this... The food was odd. It made me feel sick and tasted weird. The shrimp was supposed to be lightly coated but it was straight up fried. Their cream cheese wontons tasted like synthetic cream cheese somehow. REALLY gross. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? At any rate, Goodbye Wok Express. You lost MY business for SURE!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  We  ordered the Moo Shu pork and Shrimp with Vegetables.  The Moo Shu was cabbage mush.  The Shrimp tasted like it was just flavored with red peppered flakes.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but Chinese food always tastes amazing when you are sick, sick or not the wok express is really tasty! And order online and delivery makes it easy to get a hold of.

We orders the small egg drop soup, king pao chicken, twice cooked pork, spring rolls and we got a free order of crab puffs thanks to the specials they list while ordering.  The egg drop soup was missing something, was light and refreshing but need a bit more punch. Spring rolls were okay, crispy and the dipping sauce was good.

Best part of the meal was the king pao chicken, we ordered it spicy hot- needed more. But it tastes fresh and the sauce was delicious, it is probably one of the best I've had, especially since the chicken wasn't breaded and fried like so many other places. The twice cooked pork my bf loved, being a bit under the weather I wasn't feeling up to trying it, but it did smell and look good. My big kept going into the fridge and stealing bites.

Would definitely, happily order again!"}
{"text":"Well, if you want VOLUME, this is the place for you.  Generous portions & very fair pricing. Lunch specials for about $5.65 and dinner specials for about $8 and up.  The dinner combo includes soup, egg roll, two fried shrimp, veggie fried rice and the entree of your choice.  I prefer less food but have tastier food.  Too much of bad is just bad, but a little bit of good is excellent.  
Here's why my star allocation is the way it is:
1.  Egg drop soup which comes with the Dinner combination had very little taste.  It is about 4 ounces but considering it is free, some consumers would appreciate it.  I would rather have no soup than tasteless soup.
2.  The free fried shrimp which come with the dinner combo were 70% crust.  Shrimp not cleaned. Found a long string of poop when I opened it.  A bit oily too.  See photos.  
3.  My House chow mein which came with Fried rice did not have much flavor. A few drops of sesame oil would have done the trick.  I added soy sauce to make it taste better.  If you see the photo, it looks delightful but it is a disappointment to the taste.
4.  Hubby LOVED his Orange chicken.  It was thinly sliced chicken and lightly crusted.  They should have followed suit on the shrimp and they would have been perfect.  Had brown rice with it for 50 cents extra.  
5.  Egg roll was pretty good.  Lots of veggies and not too greasy until you get to the end of the egg roll but that is to be expected.
Cordial service, clean place, very fair pricing.  
If you want a lot of food for a cheap price, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food is great, wonton soup excellent! Plenty of food for lunch next day. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Twice for lunch and once for dinner. I love it! Great food, great portions (enough for left overs which I love). And the service is great as well! Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Best item every time is the egg foo young. Food is decent service is fast. Good prices and an excellent value"}
{"text":"Again, good, fresh, Chinese-American food. I tried the shrimp & vegetables. The white sauce was made with wine and garlic, yum! They don't skimp on either the variety of veggies with mushrooms, cabbage, green beans, water chestnuts, snow peas, carrots, broccoli, or the amount of shrimp! My other half had pot stickers and hot and sour soup. The pot stickers are a definite hit as is the dipping sauce. The hot and sour soup had more heat today than the last time so, although good, it was a bit of a surprise."}
{"text":"The map on here shows it at an odd location - They are at SW Corner Greenway & Tatum.  This is a neighborhood staple.  The owner, Winnie, is so friendly and personable.  Locals know this place is the real deal.  Tasty, fast, friendly.  What more can you ask for with such great prices too!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I tried this place out because of the reviews. The food was terrible. The customer service was horrible. I ordered Crab Wontons and when I took a bite, it was just cream cheese? I ask the waiter if it was a mistake and he informed me that he didn't know and he \"guesses that it was cream cheese.\" I walked to the register and I talk to the lady, she was so rude because I asked if they are crab wontons why don't they have crab? She said that that's what they are called and I have to pay. I had no problem paying I just wanted to know why they are called crab wontons when they have no crab? Talk about false advertising. If I could give this place no star, I definitely would. Don't fall for all the great reviews because in all reality this place sucks."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! Super big portions. I finally found a great Chinese delivery place."}
{"text":"Not sure why such high reviews, I've ordered delivery from Wok Express a few times now being willing to give them a second chance and I continue to be let down. The lo-mein tastes like a dirty wok, metallic and burnt taste that was not at all appetizing. The chicken was ok the first time, and deep fried to jerky another time. I likely will pass on taking a third shot, there are better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great little joint. Glad someone recommended it to us. Service feels like high-end restaurant with budget prices. 
Food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"It's been four years since I first posted my review. The food and service- still good. I got the small shrimp egg fried rice this time. It was very good. They give you a good portion for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Oh me, oh my! Where will I find good Chinese food? Oh wait! I have! The Wok Express is the place to go for food that doesn't make you feel like your going broke waiting on your next paycheck.

I usually only order the same 5 items since I'm so basic, but I don't care. It fills the void in my lifeless world while reminding of me that I have no life goals.

Overall, the food helps me sleep at night just like a lullaby. It slowly caresses my intestines while serenading my anus.

Good job, The Wok Express, good job!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese meals I recommend lettuce wraps, crab Rangoon , steamed dumplings , hot and sour soup 
Bourbon chicken , orange chicken , rib appetizers , donuts and Chinese fortune cookies 
Always pleasant 
This is a once a week visit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places around. Reasonable prices (especially their lunch specials!) good food. I highly recommend the crab puffs. I regularly get the Mongolian beef and orange chicken. The beef sticks are good too!"}
{"text":"Visited today at lunch for a take out order. The woman working at the counter was very friendly and polite. I had high hopes based on other Yelpers reviews. Unfortunately a few hours after eating my food I became quite ill, very unfortunate. It might be because of the amount of fried items we ordered. (Crab puffs and shrimp) I also had sweet and sour pork- probably should have stuck with chicken as that is more popular. The value for your money is awesome, you are given a lot of food- I won't be visiting again anytime soon though."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and wasn't impressed. Wife ordered chicken broccoli and I ordered the Shanghai Mei Fun. 
According to my wife, her dish's sauce was sweet, but she enjoyed it.

My dish was not enjoyable. For starters, Mei Fun is made with rice noodles, but this place uses thin wheat noodles. I have a gluten sensitivity, didn't catch that they weren't rice right away and am now suffering from my lack of attention to what I was eating.
Although the BBQ pork pieces and the shrimp were tasty, the rest of the dish had no flavor. It's almost as if they forgot to add the curry sauce to my dish. Even if the noodles were right, I would have had to add a full bottle of sauce to add taste."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is always fresh and they can customize our orders to fit within our low carb and low sodium diet. The owners are always friendly and the customer service from the staff is top notch!

I highly recommend the happy family, chicken and mushrooms, and the fish dinner (they only have it around Easter)."}
{"text":"The food is incredibly yucky. fried food is not acceptable if it is visibly drenched in oil. food here will clog your arteries. the food also tasted bad. the pan fried noodles did not have any meat in them ( well one tiny piece of pork was what it had ).

They should drastically cut down on all the oily stuff. Just over the top, I kid you not.

The lettuce wrap was just so-so. I expected more considering it doesn't come cheap. Stay away from this joint....... Panda Express is infinitely so much better and doesn't rip you off."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the house Chow Mein, 2 egg rolls, and a small  Wonton soup. It was great. We have never had a soup with so much food.  It had shrimp, beef, chicken,  broccoli, green beans, carrots, water chestnut, and 2 wontons. One of the best egg rolls we ever had. All for $18.00"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place! Which is really saying something because I have never really cared for Chinese food. They aren't from my job or house and they deliver. In the week since I've found this place I've tried the lo mein, which was good but not my favorite. The show stopper is the orange chicken, literally the best orange chicken I've ever had and the reason I'll keep coming back. Perfect balance of sweet and price, very flavorful and plentiful, on top of the price, amazing! My mom tried the beef and broccoli, which she liked. My brother tried the almond chicken and he liked it. The crab puffs are really good to. I don't care for the egg rolls or the egg drop soup but they can't be great at everything, it wouldn't be fair. They are nice, professional, quick and the place is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for Chinese food. Not too greasy, good flavor.  Can't get five stars due to atmosphere, but waiter was nice. We got super yummy orange chicken,  not too great sweat and sour chicken, and pretty decent chow mein. Good price for lunch, even had leftovers for later."}
{"text":"This was a go to for my family and I. Tonight my mom and I shared kung pao two which is chicken and shrimp. When we got the dish there were only 3 shrimp. I asked the lady if we could get more because we paid more to have the shrimp with the chicken instead of just the kung pao chicken by itself. The woman took my fork and started to move the food on my plate around looking for shrimp. I couldn't believe it. Then she told me that's the usual amount of shrimp you get because shrimp is expensive. Finally I asked her to leave the table because she kept arguing with me. I won't be back. Horrible customer service and downright rude Asian lady. Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Hands down, best take out Chinese in Phx/Scottsdale. For 2 of us, We ordered the fried rice to share, orange chicken, sesame chicken and wontons. Everything was amazing - this will definitely become one of our go-to's! Tip: the portions are generous! We were stuffed and hardly made a dent...we would've been fine with just 1 order of chicken and half order of wontons. The people who work there are super friendly as well, so that's just icing on the cake. Love love this place, will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My son and I love this place. We have been coming here for years. Not once have we had bad service or bad food. Every single dish we have ever had here has been so yummy. The staff is always friendly. The owner even remembers what we order even when I forget that my son wants the fried rice instead of white! I love that. I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a wonderful lunch!!   My husband and I came in for lunch and had never been before.   On first sight- it was very clean! Big relief.   The staff was friendly and the food.... Wow.   Had to get a to go box there was so much food..... And this was off the lunch menu.    Price was only $17.00 INCLUDING TIP for TWO people!!!      We will be back!"}
{"text":"Get the orange chicken, like now. SO good. Other favorites: Moo Goo Gai Pan, House chow mein, amazing won ton soup, all the apps are delicious; crab puffs, egg rolls, all good. I think this is the only place in Phx that still serves those crispy won ton strips they call them 'chips'. They're like a $1, totally worth it, they go great w/ the soup or even just as a crunchy extra sprinkled on top of the moo goo gai pan. This is a family owned place and the same guy who I think is the father always delivers my food & he is so very kind & sweet. I hope this place never leaves, I have no idea where we'd get our Chinese food. It very much reminds me of one of my favorite Chinese takeout places when I lived in Orange County, CA as a kid...."}
{"text":"Not at all recommended. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to Chinese food but this is really sub-par.  Greasy, salty food with low grade ingredients.  Gut buster that leaves you disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for delivery chinese.  Not only are the prices more than fair, but the food is amazing. Delivery never takes very long and we always have leftovers which makes for yummy snacks or lunch for the next day.
My favorites are the orange chicken and the vegetable chow mein or the vegetable fried rice.
If you are in the area and looking for delicious quick and cheap chinese food, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat Wok Express for really tasty take-away Chinese food.  So far we have had all of the appetizers except the lettuce wraps and they are all excellent.  Egg Drop soup - also excellent with a lot more soup than stock.

Entrees - We have tried the Sesame chicken, HS Egg foo Young, HS Mi Fun Noodles, Walnut Shrimp, and the sweet and sour Chicken.  ALL great with large portions.
  
The staff is really pleasant and makes sure you get all of your order.

And the online order system actually works!

We are going to work our way through the entire menu. . ."}
{"text":"We get delivery from here every couple weeks.  They are always prompt on delivery and they have decent quality food.  My husband always has to ask for extra spicy on his general tso's chicken to get it hot enough for him.  I usually get the chicken with broccoli and it is almost always good.  Overall I am not a fan of Chinese food in Phoenix in general but when a craving strikes, this place will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"This is our favorite chinese restraunt, very good food , clean , friendly atmosphere and Excellent customer service we give them a 5 star"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant! Always get greeted and treated great, I have no complains for the multiple years we have been going. The prices are great for the quantity and they have delivery which is always convenient when feeling lazy. Will always crave this place for years to come."}
{"text":"If I can rate this place -5 stars, I would. I came to this place for lunch because of all the \"great\" reviews. Came to find out, this place has bad service and awful food. Don't be like me as being gullible. The food sucks as well the service. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yelp says 5 miles away, my GPS agrees...they claim to be 9 miles away. \"We now deliver\". What a joke."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing 4 stars on yelp. We must have come on a really bad night. This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot & sour soup was too spicy to eat and I could only taste pepper. The fried shrimp & egg roll with the meal was swimming in grease-very old grease. We took about two bites of our orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken before deciding it was too gross to eat. It only gets 2 stars because the workers were super nice!"}
{"text":"It's so disappointing to pay over $50 for bad Chinese. Absolutely bland no flavor. But very salty. MSG? And if you're going to allow customers to choose a level of spice for their dishes, then maybe add the spice. No spiciness whatsoever and we ordered the most spice available. Will not return."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff... However, the food was soooo bland, there was no flavor whatsoever! Even my kids commented on how flavorless the food was! Because this place had such a high rating, I wanted to give it a try... Wow, I'm beginning to doubt YELP!"}
{"text":"I'm going to very quickly write a review as I wait for my takeout. Located next to Dollar Tree in the Safeway shopping center. Now that it's under new ownership owned by a nice family, the quality of the food has definitely improved. 
I love coming here now to order their moo shu chicken, hot & sour soup, yu shan chicken, lettuce wrap. 
The interior has been brightened with new furniture and fresh paint & decorations. It is much nicer than before. The only thing which I am not sure how you would get rid of it is when you initially walk in, the place smells stale.  Maybe cause I got here just as they opened and the place needs to get aired out. 
I love coming to family owned places especially one where the owner greets you with a warm smile. I hope this business does well. Support local, shop small!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese Food. It was our last night in Arizona and I wanted to try some local Chinese food. I guess it's hard to find something I would consider really good because since I live in the Bay Area we have access to some of the best Chinese food arguably in the Country. I came here with my friend around 8pm and we ordered a couple of dishes including: a large Chow Mein, Large Fried Rice, small sesame chicken, large War Won Ton Soup and a small Beef Broccoli. It all came out to about $40 bucks which wasn't bad for the huge amount of food we received. We took the food back to our house and chowed down there. I wasn't a fan of the war Won Ton Soup. I thought it was bland and the won ton's were't good they broke apart too easily. The fried rice wasn't good. It had no taste to it and I had to add soy sauce to give it a bit of flavor. The Chow Mein was great and was easily one of the best dishes there. The sesame chicken was really good too and worked perfectly with the chow mein. The Beef Broccoli tasted a bit off and once again tasted bland to me. I was disappointed the kid behind the counter didn't tell us the dishes came with white rice already as well which meant we could have not ordered fried rice and got something else. I liked some of the food, but most of it was a miss for me. Overall, I might give it another try down the line if I am in the area just in case this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Outstanding and authentic Chinese food! Great service. The atmosphere is spartan, however the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I am going to have to update my review because I've come multiple times now and I feel that the food has gone downhill since my original five star review. Some food entrees have lacked flavor and didn't taste as fresh. I haven't frequented this place recently because I can't expect great food - it's just ok. Ok if you are craving Chinese food and you are nearby.

Original: on my way home from work, I was craving fried rice and stopped by the Wok Express. I ordered a large BBQ pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and Mongolian beef. The lady that rang me up was really friendly and the price for all three items was inexpensive - around $25.

I went home and started digging in. The portions are extremely generous (the 3 entrees could probably feed 4 or 5 people), but the taste was surprisingly delicious. It's difficult to find good, fresh tasting Chinese food in Phoenix and so I don't eat Chinese often, but I think since I found this place, I'm going to be eating Chinese more often. 

My hubby came home and I heated the leftovers for him to eat for dinner and he too loved the food. For the value and taste - you know I have to give this place five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned neighborhood place serving tasty Mandarin and Szechuan style dishes as well as the plainer stuff.  Good for spicy food lovers.  They use a 1-10 stars system.  Love the hot and sour soup and chicken chow mein.  Usually go at lunch time, but I also do takeout for dinner.  Cafe style decor with tile floor and laminate tabletops, not fancy at all.  Come as you are!  Located in a strip mall so no problems with parking."}
{"text":"great food at perfectly reasonable, order-at-the-counter prices. they've got all the normal stuff on the menu, plus some nice surprises like lettuce wraps. i've now visited 3 times in a week. lunch specials are large and cheap and for 50 cents more you can get brown rice instead of white rice. i can't understand it, but in phx it is beyond impossible to find a decent, quick chinese restaurant that serves brown rice. the sesame chicken was made with good, white meat chicken, a bit spicy and not greasy despite being fried. the kung pao chicken is the best i've had in a very long time. again made with white meat chicken and has celery and water chestnuts in it, which i'm not used to but enjoyed. and finally the hot and sour soup, complete with shrimp and beef, mushrooms, bamboo shoots was beyond amazing. i love a good hot and sour soup when i'm sick and i just happen to be sick right now. cleared out my sinuses no problem and was tasty too.

the place is clean ... beyond clean. everything is made fresh to order, even soups. the staff is kind and helpful. i'm looking forward to going here a lot!"}
{"text":"There are two things I look for in Chinese restaurants: Potstickers and Orange Chicken. This place does awesome things with both! The potstickers and the sauce taste great. Sometimes with potstickers there can be a weird texture but these potstickers have a great texture and they are a big portion which is great to dip in the sauce. The sauce is really awesomely balanced. The orange chicken though is the star: amazing taste and texture. It has my fiance and I coming back pretty much every week! 

The prices are great for the food and the service is attentive as well."}
{"text":"The only thing about this joint that was mentionable was the delivery 


One time and pleasant 
Two combinations ordered both proteins over cooked 
Sides of fried rice under seasoned a whopping two peas found in the mounds 
Accompanied by two mushy egg rolls"}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer, does smell like a backed up sewer in the restaurant.  Food was good, large portion."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from The Wok Express yesterday and I must say I was really looking forward to my food after reading the good reviews and seeing the pics of some pretty fantastic looking food! However, I was left quite unsatisfied.  I ordered the potstickers and crab puffs as apps and the pot stickers were mushy and the filling was not what I'm used to getting at any other Chinese restaurant. The crab puffs were not fully cooked...the filling was cold in the middle while the exterior was still warm so I know it wasn't an issue with it being a delivery order. The teriyaki chicken was very dried out and the combo fried rice with pineapple and cashews was not what would be considered fried rice and was pretty flavorless. It was steamed rice that had been tossed with traditional fried rice elements and the pineapple bits were canned and tasted like they had been left out of their juice for a while as they were pretty tasteless...which is weird for pineapple! I really did want to love this place, but unfortunately I'm not going to be ordering from here again. Giving two stars instead of one because the ease of use of their delivery app and how quick our food arrived. The delivery driver was very nice as well."}
{"text":"I have been searching and searching for a Chinese place in the valley and I have finally found it! I ordered beef chow fun, and the portions are huge! Enough to share with 2-3 more people! The quality was fantastic, the beef was cooked perfect. My only suggestion is to add double meat as the protein to noodle ratio was uneven. 


My boyfriend got general tso chicken with chow mein. The chow mein was basically just cooked noodles, no veggies or any seasoning and underwhelming. The chicken was listed as spicy but was not, I also suggest adding extra protein as there is a large portion of veggies and a small amount of meat. 

The star of the show was the wonton soup! Please just get it, you will not be disappointed. Wontons, veggies, chicken, beef all combined in a perfectly balanced broth."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, value and service. 

Any lunch special offered here is a fantastic value as it comes with fried rice, spring roll, wontons and entree. The mu shoo pork and pork fried rice and pot stickers are the best I've had in a long time and food is prepared fresh and quickly. I mostly order for pick up, which you can add special requests to such as spice level and add or omit specific ingredients. In fact, I have most of my entire office \"addicted\" to the flavor of The Wok Express to where we order at least once a week. I just ordered the Orange Beef today for the first time and I'm  excited to say that I think I've found a new favorite! I'm treated very well by the staff/owners here and will never go to another Chinese Food restaurant in the Scottsdale area.

Make sure you try the Orange Chicken lunch special if you're a fan of the stuff. This is the BEST OC you will find, they fry it up extra crispy, and you'll never go back to Panda Express after you have had it here!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food.  Had moo shy beef and sweet& sour chicken.  Good crab puffs.  Great online ordering and discounts"}
{"text":"I dont know how they have almost 4 stars. Me and my boyfriend went and and didn't get greeted and were rushed to order even though we were the only ones there. Then I proceeded to ask for boba and what flavors they have and she said \"none\" I'm also not sure what type of orange chicken/fried rice this is, but it's definitely not what I ordered."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place. I just wish it was closer to home instead of work. They make the best wor wonton soup- Love it!"}
{"text":"Chinese used to be good and cheap. This us expensive for by par food. Greasy and gelatinous.
Service was good,  friendly. Place is being remodeled so having construction supplies in the dinning room wasn't exactly clean. Water tasted like faucet water.
Would not return."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave places, I like the orange tofu since I am a vegetarian, but the mixed veg- wish it had more broccoli in it, and I do love the fact they have brown rice. All in all I like the place to go there fairly regularly."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to defend this place and no I don't work here.  I am a Scottsdale business owner who has been eating here for about a year regularly.  The manager and owner is the nicest woman on the planet and remembers her customers names every time they come in.  They are also the only Chinese restaurant I know of that is moderately priced that uses all white meat chicken.  Some of their items like their orange chicken I am not crazy about but their chow mein is awesome and most of their dishes are pretty darn good.  I can only imagine that most of your story is fabricated around the fact that she asked you to pay the difference and your too cheap to pay it.  To say their food is bad because you can't afford a dollar more to upgrade to the next dish is pretty low.  Maybe you should try running your own business and offer low prices in tough economic times and then have cheapskates ask for a free meal.  Don't let this homer fool you the manager is as nice as can be and this is a good Chinese place with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food was great, probably one of the better Chinese restaurants I've been to in a while. The price and portions where one point. The orange chicken and chow mein was great"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I have no idea why the reviews are so high, this place was absolutely inedible I had the sweet and sour shrimp and my mom ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and we had to throw both away. The place was busy at the time but that shouldn't mean that the food should be this way. We will never be going back here, absolutely revolting"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung Pao chicken dinner plate. The chicken was really tough, and not very tasty. I came here on a recommendation from a friend."}
{"text":"Excellent  Excellent  and delivers.... can't say enough about food and service.  If you actually go in they give you so much.  You don't go away hungry 2 hrs later.  Tea is excellent."}
{"text":"The chicken pan fried noddles are the best! The orange chicken is amazing as well!
Definitely a fast and easy place to order and take out. I felt like the food tasted authentic and the restaurant was clean. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their food is full of flavor, never bland. The staff are so friendly and very helpful when you are unsure of what you want. The prices are on point and the food is made fast. We have never had to wait. I know they offer delivery but we always swing by and pick ours up. I recommend this place for Chinese. It's delicious and the staff are wonderful"}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch one day.  I ordered BBQ pork fried rice and crab puffs.  I was very impressed by their crab puffs.  First of all, you get 8 in an order.  Secondly, they are light and crisp and delicious.  The fried rice was ok.  There was nothing special about it.  I would order it again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in my area. I have never eaten at the restaurant so I can't comment on their service in that regard, but their food is great. I love their eggplant and orange chicken and their hot and sour and wonton soups are very flavorful. Their prices are reasonable and they have nice sized portions, offering small and large portion sizes for each of their dishes. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrific customer service.  I have been coming here for years. The last few times i let the drop in quality and bad customer service slide.  Walked out this time."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very friendly staff.  I had their wonton soup, which may be one of the best I've ever had.   I also enjoyed their Mongolian bf and spicy beef."}
{"text":"Awesome food no matter what you order. The kung pao deluxe is awesome and the crab puffs are nice and big.  The family is great and very friendly. I have been going to the restaurant for many years and always suggest the restaurant to people around there. Try it and you will see."}
{"text":"Great food! This is the best Chinese food restaurant in my area. We ordered the orange chicken and Mongolian chicken and we were not disappointed. The egg drop soup was also great along with the crab puffs."}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Very average food. Very cheap.  Very hard to imagine ever returning again!

Our family was super hungry tonight and everyone WANTED to like this place. Ordered take out via phone  - food was ready in about 15 minutes

I found this so-so place after having received a bright pink paper menu at our front door. Based on the generally favorable YELP reviews I was EXCITED... and kept this  place in mind for when the family was in the mood for Chinese. 

All the over the top and highly exaggerated comments by other YELPERS should have been a dead giveaway that this place might not be as good as advertised. 

Here are some of my faves: \"Oh my god - this place is stupid good\" and \"My favorite Chinese place. I just wish it was closer to home instead of work.\" \"Yum, yum, I will be back for more Chinese food! And if possible as often as I can! : )
Recommended!!! Yes!!!\" 

You've got  to be joking! These reviews are an illusion my friends -I respectfully suggest you WOK away and find a better Chinese restaurant! 

Maybe some of these YELPERS have another wacky definition of what competent (or even decent) Chinese food tastes like. This ain't it. 

Food was consistently bland, sauces were so-so, portions big ...but who cares as the food was no good! 

We ordered the following items - and they all were rated by the entire family as being average to below average in taste (we just threw away all the Styrofoam boxes of leftovers - and there were plenty of leftoevers):

1. MONGOLIAN BEEF (A tasteless brew of chewy/shoe leather dried out meat and bland brown sauce with slivered  onions and limpy scallions. The menu rates this as spicy and yet there was not a single hot pepper or spicy note to be detected. Very poor)

2. LETTUCE WRAPS (Another tasteless bomb - ground chicken with what tasted like stale and non-crunchy dry rice noodles. Chicken meat was also dry and bland. PF Chang's or Pei Wei beats theirs hands down. I used extra plum sauce to drown out the bad taste).

3. CHICKEN CHOW MEIN (Bland and boring dud of a dish - tasteless white meat chicken and a tasteless brown sauce with overcooked noodles few veggies. No flavor.) 

4. POTSTICKERS (This was the best of all the dishes tried. Fairly tasty filling, but the outside of the potstickers were not seared or cooked enough, so these were more like steamed dumplings than potstickers).

5. CHICKEN FRIED RICE (We used the menu coupon to order the free Chicken Fried Rice. Rice was also bland like their other dishes, could not detect that the rice was even moderately fried as it rice was still white like normal non-fried rice. Almost no egg to be found, very little chicken, another tasteless item)

Look, I know good Chinese food - and I will seek it out when I find it and return again and again. 

So folks you have a choice - you can believe all the other gushy \"over the top\" reviews here (just curious if real people actually wrote those other gushy reviews?), or you can take my humble word for it and save yourself  money and time by avoiding this disappointing dive."}
{"text":"Great place in a secluded strip center.  Everything is awesome and the staff is happy....lol, which is nice...."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place because it's the best Chinese delivery we've ever had!  It comes so hot you'd think you're in the restaurant.  The ingredients are high quality and well done.  The Garlic chicken and Mongolian beef are our go-tos.  When is arrives you can tell it was just prepared and delivered quickly.  The veggies in the dishes still have a little bite which I love, you can tell it was made fresh and hasn't been reheated.  Thanks, Wok Express!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood Chinese restaurant makes me wish I lived close by!

We were in town for vacation and ended up ordering from them twice, they were so good.  We did not eat in, but did pick up so I know this isn't a date place or fancy in anyway.  But the food was just what we were looking for.

Prices were very reasonable, taste was on point, and portions were large.

Mongolian Beef - Big, tender, flavorful pieces of beef
Shrimp with Vegetables - Lots of big shrimp, veggies included carrots, celery, broccoli, green beans, and snow peas.
Orange Chicken - Not too much batter, great orange flavor with just a little bit of heat.
Beef and Broccoli - Beef was thinner than in Mongolian Beef but still tender and flavorful.  Broccoli could have been cooked a little more but that is personal preference.
Fried Wontons - I think these were supposed to be crab rangoon but there was no crab in them, just cream cheese.  But they were REALLY TASTY!  Deep fried but not greasy, sweet and salty.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"Great take out and I finally went to the restaurant to pick up my order and the place is really nice.  We'll have to try dining in some time too"}
{"text":"I have called in an order and have done take out. Each time the people were friendly, the food was made quickly and the food has so far always been good. I recommend the beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food in AZ. Huge portions and the food is soooo good. We eat here 1-2 times a week. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"The fried egg rolls were awesome and crispy. The crab puffs were good also but there is no crab what so ever, just call them cream cheese rangoon`s or something. We also got a large order of orange chicken, kung poa shrimp and chicken vegetable. The orange chicken was cut in such large pieces they needed a knife but were also over cooked and dry. The kung poa shrimp was mostly celery and peanuts, gross. The chicken and vegetable went to the trash, no flavor, very dull color from what i expected to be fresh veggies. Their \"fried rice\" is just plain white rice with a little bit of soy sauce, no veg, eggs, sprouts, NOTHING! Overall i have better chinese food at the airport panda express. Definitely not worth my $32.84"}
{"text":"Eatiing here now very easy and friendly. The food is grat as well. Orange chicken and rice is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Orange chicken here is unreal and omg holy good white rice. Schesuan chicken is bomb.com with tons of veggies mmm"}
{"text":"Finally I have found a good Chinese food place that is delicious and inexpensive :) went in on a Sunday yes they are open Sunday's even though yelp says closed when brining up on phone 12-9. I ordered 2 lunch combos to go an order of sesame
chicken and sweat and Sour chicken yum yum and yum !!! They are very generous portions and come with 2 won tons fried rice and egg drop soup & spring roll per order I ordered a egg roll too honestly
Their spring rolls where better but for $15 bucks you can't go wrong and it kept me and my husband and daughter full till dinner unlike most Chinese places where you feel
Hungry a few hrs later . This will be our new place it was very clean inside and the lady running the front was super sweet and friendly. My only regret is that I didn't find this gem sooner."}
{"text":"Ich. Too early to arrive at the airport for a flight and craving Chinese food, I followed YELPs strong rating for Wok Express. I apparently committed a horrible sin - mistakenly ordering up front when I wanted to eat in. I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant. Seriously, you'd think I'd burned the building down. The waitress made a point of treating the 3 other people in the restaurant fabulously while systematically refusing to so much as get me a cup of water. Nasty glares the whole time I sat there. Other workers at the restaurant witnessed this behavior. They shrugged and did nothing. The food was ok; the ambience - non-existent; the bathroom not dirty but FILTHY. Skip this, for sure."}
{"text":"Husband and I went looking for a local Chinese food restaurant that does Dine-In, Take Out, and Delivery to our home.  This place fit the bill so we went for dinner.  I always like to visit a restaurant before using a delivery service because I like to know where the food comes from.  I was pleased when we entered as it was a brightly lit and clean no-frills Chinese express type restaurant.  The clean part is important to me.  Next was to try the food. My husband ordered Pork Fried Rice but asked they withhold the usual carrots and peas.  That was no problem.  I ordered their wok stir fried thin egg noodles with vegetables and tofu.  I love Chinese black mushrooms and this had it listed in their menu as part of the ingredients (they are high in iron and I am anemic).  It came out pretty quickly and though we ate there it comes out in takeout styrofoam and a plastic fork - so no plates and leftovers are easy enough to take home as they are already in take out keepers.  My husbands Pork fried rice according to him was very tasty.  Next time he mentioned he would try the chicken as the pork was on the tough side but it tasted good.  My wok stir fried thin egg noodles were quite good.  I was disappointed though that they used just boring button mushrooms and not Chinese black mushrooms in it.  The dish though I really liked the flavor.  So, it met our expectations and will definitely be our go-to for Chinese Delivery from now on.  Sorry so long winded!  :-)"}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, but if you want real Chinese food made by Chinese people for a great value - this is the place. I like places like Panda Express,  but it is not Chinese food. I can get Moo Shu Pork and real all kinds of fried rice. Vegetarians have many options. Portions are generous, so families can eat here reasonably.  If you don't have time to go to Chinese cultural center for more authentic Chinese food then this is a great place. Don't waste time at other places. And the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Just tried them out and have to say this is our new go to spot for delivery.  High quality Chinese food.  Crab puffs are amazing.  Fried rice and war wonton soup is great."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, nice clean place.  Spacious.  Definitely a stop when I go visit family in Scottsdale.

Typical Chinese takeout fare:

-Egg roll.  OMG!  Finally, an egg roll like back home in NYC.  Seems like in Vegas, they call spring rolls, egg rolls.  YUMMY!

-Wor Won Ton Soup (w/chicken breast, shrimp, beef, cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli).  This is the best Won Ton soup I've had since leaving Astoria, NY where Nuevo Jardin has top honors.

-Sesame Chicken - not great, but good enough to finish a large order.

-Mongolian Beef - So good I didn't even get to taste it.  Everyelese did though and loved it.

-Happy Family - Very good.  All the ingredients were fresh.  It made my family very happy.

-Combination Fried Rice - Very good.  Not quite as good as what I'm used to from back East, but very tasty and moist."}
{"text":"Large portions of very poor food. Top half is breading I tore off the chicken and ate, bottom half is what I'm going to throw out cause I can't stomach anymore. But hey, it's cheap for big potions of breading"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed food here, greasy, but tastes good. Crazy to dine-in during summers as it feels like no cold air in there. Take out is just fine."}
{"text":"This location has been a few places and the current one is very good. The prices are great and lots of options. Quality of food is great! Service is very attentive and speedy. A few of the sauces do lack some flavor, but they are happy to fix them."}
{"text":"We where in the area and found this place via yelp... And boy are we happy we did! 
The food had great flavor.. I got the won ton soup and it was full of fresh veggies, chicken, beef, and shrimp.. The won tons where soft and tasty.
My husband had the kung pao two dinner platter and he said it was delicious! 
Great price, great portions. The place was very clean and everyone was very nice. 
We will be back!"}
