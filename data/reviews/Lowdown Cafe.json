{"text":"NOT OPEN ON WEEKENDS! If you serve coffee be open on the weekends, please!!  I tried to come here twice and they weren't open. Pretty bummed because I was hoping there was a cafe in walking or bike ride distance from my place. Bummer."}
{"text":"RIP Low Down Cafe and your delicous egg salad, chef salad, greek dressing, chocolate chip cookies and snarky, smart and refreshingly real service."}
{"text":"How did this way cool, dinky, unassuming, independently-run gem just sit there under my nose for two years without me wandering in there? I don't really have an excuse, and after venturing in there to grab some lunch to go today, I'm kicking myself for missing out for so long.   Lowdown Cafe is located at a random, non-impressive intersection of 24th & Osborn*, with a McDonald's lording over the same corner. But don't let that fool you. Lowdown is a great change of pace once you're inside.   First, the place is small - probably seating room for 14 customers max, but it's got a nice feel to it. Local art, bookshelf with reading materials, and light mostly coming from outside.   Next, the food. The menu is mostly a whole assortment of wraps, plus some salads and the soup of the day, along with a few breakfast items. Each wrap comes with a bag of Sun Chips and will put you back around $5 - $6.50. I chose the rosemary chicken, which included roasted red pepper, grilled eggplant, arugula, tomatoes, onion, and balsamic (I eschewed the feta for obvious reasons). The lady who's working there (she looked like the owner) took my order and proceeded to make my order along with the ones before mine.   Now, the tag line of Lowdown Cafe is \"For the low tech lifestyle\" and after reading Sarah K's review it all makes sense. The place should be called \"Slowdown Cafe\" because that's exactly what I was feeling. Sure, the owner was busy prepping all the wraps, but she wasn't rushing and maniacally trying to get each order out under 2 minutes. I immediately started regretting that *I* was in a rush and had to get my order to take back to the office. Because, in all truth, I just wanted to sit there and relax with my food, and not think about, well, my high tech lifestyle for a while. So I stood there, telling myself to just chill out and take it easy. Who knew a little hole-in-the-wall that makes wraps  could put your life into perspective?  As for the wrap itself, it was great. Just as good as some of the ones I've had at That's A Wrap and maybe even better. I also enjoyed a rich, dense, and chewy chocolate chip cookie. Good stuff, I tell you. The downside of this place is it's breakfast and lunch only (open 7-3 weekdays, 8-2 on Saturdays), but I'll deal with that and come here whenever I can.   So 4 stars for now, hopefully more star wattage when I try some of the other wraps. Definitely recommended (but not if you're in a hurry).  -----------------------------  * not sure if Lowdown moved from it's original location on 24th Street (which Sarah reviewed) or if there are actually 2 of them...would need to confirm this. Looks like another trip \"to investigate\" is in order!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but I don't really even like it sadly. It is super close to my work, independently owned, and has espresso, it should have been so easy to fall in love with. Unfortunately it is kind of like that ultra hot guy you are so excited to be dating, until you realize how lame on the inside he actually is.   I have been there twice now, because I wanted to give the place a fair chance. The first time I was desperate a cappuccino, so I ran over there. They had no soy milk, and I am allergic to cow's milk. To bad, so sad.  On my second try I really wanted some good soup, since I have this yucky summer cold. I called up to asked about the soup, and lady seemed irritated by my inquiry about what the soup was today. I went in, and there were a couple of people in there already. The lady was busy, and was yelling in the back for someone else to get up there. I can see how she might have been a little stressed, but what's with all the angry yelling?  She asked what I wanted, and I said the soup and some orange juice. She said OK, and then I stood there for 10 minutes. Another woman came in who she apparently knew, and she was friendly with her. I don't need to be coddled, but there was not a hint of friendliness towards me at all. I am sure the lady was a regular, but how about being welcoming to a new customer? I felt like I was an unwanted guest in a rude neighbor's house.  So, I finally get my soup, and the gal tells me she had to heat it up. Their menu said they made fresh soup every day. Why would you have to re-heat soup at 11:30 AM unless it was from the day before? Then I watched the other girl pour my OJ. It was Minute Maid from concentrate. I understand that not everyone is the Orange Table and does fresh squeezed juice, but how about something that is least not from concentrate. Sorry, I don't want to pay $1.75 for a cup of OJ I wouldn't buy at the store.  As I left, I thought to myself, this better be some awesome soup considering the unfriendly service. You know, kind of like the Soup Nazi, you are willing to put up with unfriendly service for good product.  Sad to say, the soup was bland and had a gross layer of oil. I tried to absorb all the oil up with napkins, but I couldn't get it all. It grossed me out as I ate it, but I was sick, and I needed to eat.   Just and FYI a previous review said they deliver for free, but there was a note in the menu that clearly stated they have a $1 delivery charge. Not a big deal, but good to know.  Lowdown cafe, you are not for me"}
{"text":"If you like little joints where the owner will remember your order this place is great! It's the type of place you need to experience a few times before you know what to expect. The hours change now and again so you always have to keep up with the schedule. If you go between 11 and 12:30 you will be waiting quite awhile for your food and checking out can be confusing or have a bit of a wait time. Not to fear, I take my hour lunch at Lowdown often and have never been late coming back. The food is phenomenal. I am not much of a wrap person but I have never had a bad wrap from this place. I recommend the rosemary chicken. Rebecca J's review mentions the relaxed atmosphere. While she finds some of the relaxed behavior odd, I think it is quaint and charming."}
{"text":"What else do you want from a couple of gals just trying to provide a service? Wait you want them to be nice??  No way.  You know what my favorite thing about Low Down Cafe is.  They just are themselves.  They want to be a little grumpy, fine.  They are going to be a little grumpy.  If they want to continually make fun of a friend I go with, they will.  I love that.  We aren't here to impress, we are here to get you some food and a laugh.  I feel like I'm back east.  The food is great here.  I order a creation called the Chicken Adobo (not found on the menu) which has chicken, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and special sauce.  The delight of the meal comes afterward.  This is probably the best chocolate chip cookie in town.  It's about the size of a hockey puck, and if you are lucky you will be able to get it fresh out of the oven (a little big warm and gooey).  I'm a big fan of the Low Down Cafe.  Just don't tell any one about it.  Too many people already know."}
{"text":"The location is very unassuming, but the Chai is AWESOME! I typically hate ginger, but the thai has this great gingery scent and a little bit of the kick. It makes a great beverage meal, as it's incredibly complex and filling.   The hummus is rather good too.  Fie on the restaurant portion (and minus a star) for the lack of vegetarian friendly options."}
{"text":"Meh.   The Lowdown Cafe is indeed lowdown...if you want something that looks like your grandma's kitchen where she doles out crotchety commentary while her overworked daughter tries to keep up with her demands and you may or may not actually eat what you ordered, then head on down.  To be fair, I think I arrived at the tail end of preparations for a large take-out order, which bogged things down. Even so, I ordered a Garden Pesto Pita, and the younger woman asked me to repeat my order when she finally got around to making it, and then I think she made the Grilled Vegetable Pita regardless. It was mighty tasty (if a bit oily) but there was nary a pesto to be found.   Lowdown Cafe takes relaxed to a new level. I'm not such a fan of watching my food being prepared right in front of me if it means I watch Mama Lowdown chop and dice with no gloves and take occasional munches of what's going into my lunch. Ick. Also, one of the customers at the counter (apparently a regular) felt so relaxed that he periodically wandered behind the counter to wash his hands and throw out his trash. Pretty sure that's against code.  The Ginger Chai Latte (iced) is very tasty, very gingery.   I don't think I'll be back, because there are so many other places I want to try. But if you're in the neighborhood, aren't in a hurry, and aren't picky about what you get to eat, give the place a try."}
{"text":"5 stars for the hot Ginger Chai latte. It serves a sore throat well. Kudos to the chicken soup, too. It was delicious. Mmm Mmm good.  Super yuck for the side of veggies that was cold and tasted charred. I took one bit and about gagged.   There's plenty of parking behind the place, too, which is a plus when you're trying to beat or compete with the lunch rush. You'll have to walk through the smell of frying fries, thanks to the fast food joint nearby.  There wasn't much of a rush when my friend, Kym, and I went around noon, though. It picked up after a bit, though.   There's not much atmosphere here. The menu offers salads and wraps, along with coffee and tea. It's a cool spot to check out once. Would I go back? Hrm. Yes, but only for that ginger chai latte. I will definitely be craving that in the future."}
{"text":"For those who may remember the original Lowdown Cafe on 24th Street, heads up.  They've relocated. The new space is much more zen then the former strip mall location next to the sketchy 7-Eleven.  Below is my original review of the 24th Street location.  Every single word is still absolutely true.  ______________  Lowdown offers healthy homemade wraps, salads, and freshly prepared soup.  My favorites are the \"Grilled Veggie Wrap\" and the \"Corridor Princess Salad.\"  A box lunch will cost you 6 - 8 bucks and comes with your choice of sandwich/wrap, a drink, chips, and a homemade cookie.  And they deliver for free!  Breakfast is pretty good as well.  Apparently, the two gals that own and run this little gem are Silicon Valley burn-outs who left after the big crash.  A little taste of Cali in the Valley.   I highly recommend Lowdown."}
