{"text":"North 44 has a manager who does not know how to listen to his customer. I called the restaurant the day before our dinner and was told clearly they charged $50 for bringing your own wine. I asked for confirmation that the charge is for three bottles of wine for my whole table. She went away and came back with a firm confirmation that it is for the three bottles of wines and the whole table. I am OK if the restaurant make a mistake and apologize, but NO. The manager went to an extend to deny and repeatedly inviting his staff to join the conversation to make a point that his staff did not make a mistake and it was me who did not get it right. If this is a high end restaurant, then they employed the wrong manager. He kept explaining the logic behind the $50 charge forgotten that the tips for  the dinner is more than the amount and why explained his business logic to a customer. No one is interested of how he does his business or he must make at least $50 profit per bottle of wine. Wonder if he explains to his customer how his chef cook the food when the customer is not happy with the food. North44 charges is high. The charges are not just the food, but the experience and satisfaction. The manager failed. North 44 should not hire a cheap manager to serve his high end customers."}
{"text":"Very luxurious restaurant. The food is amazing of course (since it is very expensive I was not surprised). I would give this restaurant a 4 star and not 5 simply because the server that took our order seemed very irritated. I was undecided about what I wanted for my Entree so I asked her some questions. I could feel her impatience growing inside of her , which gave me a very bad first experience of this restaurant and also made me feel very uncomfortable . As the night was going on, other lovely people were serving us and even the manager had a chat with us by the end of the night ! She was so lovely and caring and made sure we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Food: B+
Service: B+
Food presentation: A
Atmosphere: A
Prices: C+
Recommended?:  Only If you have extra $ that you want to throw away. 

Not really sure what the hype is about. The food is OK but nothing too special and the portions are way too small, especially considering the prices. The staff are attentive and accommodating but the service is slow. On the plus side, the restaurant does provide a romantic setting. Bottom line, if you want to go to a fancy restaurant, I would recommend Centro, which is across the street, or Scaramouche, which I reviewed earlier."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was too stuffy, could have been more attentive. Ambiance is too traditional..  Doesn't feel updated.  Overall, not a good value for the money"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to North 44 in quite a few years and thought I'd try it again. 

My friend and I began by having oysters at five dollars each. This is at least a dollar to $1.50 more than the what the oyster bars around town charge. The Kusshi (which I've had many many times at other places) were on the verge of going bad and one of mine, when you stuck a fork in it, fell apart to mush. I was concerned that I'd be sick if I ingested it so I asked our waiter if he would please get me another. He proceeded to tell me that this is the way Kusshi's react when you put a fork in them. WTF?  I politely told him that I had had this type of oyster a number of times and there was definitely something wrong with it. 

So one would've thought that was the end of that. However the snooty horn-rimmed manager came over and proceeded to lecture me on the properties of this particular oyster. So much so that my dinner companion became visibly uncomfortable. 

I chose to take the highroad, smile and tell him that I appreciated him bringing me a replacement. To add insult to injury at the end of it all, they didn't even give us a freebie - they charged us for it!  

The rest of the food was OK, however because of where we were seated I got bumped into constantly by numerous waiters throughout the entire two hours. There was at least 6 feet of open space behind my chair so there was no excuse for this to keep happening.  Put simply, it was aggressive.

I know we all say it, but there are far too many restaurants in this town to have to put up with this kind of nonsense. Give it a pass."}
{"text":"Disappointed again.
Tried twice last winterlecious and this summerlecious; no improvement.
Not only the taste but also presentation needs a lot of improvement.
Service was ok.
Only good thing I can say is olive bread was good and warm."}
{"text":"I love it here!
Love it so much that I even composed this little ditty about North 44...

When there's a zombie at your feet,
And he wants something quick to eat,
And his homeland is Bangladesh
And all he wants is your FLESH!!!
Yakety, yak
Don't talk back..."}
{"text":"Very good food and service, we had Ahi tuna (appetizer), Veal tenderloin and Pan roasted Dover sole.  They were excellent.

I'll give them 4/5 stars because I think they are a bit over-priced.  But it is a must try if you are looking for a good dinning experience."}
{"text":"For a restaurant with a reputation that precedes it like North 44,, honestly I expected much more. I've been there a couple of times, and I have to say the dessert and the wine list are the highlight. As this place is close to my house, I want to like it, and I can tell it attracts a particular high end crowd but I don't think it is because of the food. the atmosphere here is great, and the service is impeccable.

I've really enjoyed their oysters. However, their mains did not live up to their their expectations. Our server practically made my mouth water as she told me about their house specialty the sole fish. It is delivered unfrozen from Holland. In reality, it tasted OK. My partner had their steak, and the side mushroom risotto was better than the steak which says a lot. 

All in all for dropping over 200$ at a restaurant, I doubt I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious last night.  Was ok but I did have some issues mostly with the menu not the execution which was flawless..  I had the steak tartar which was good but no different than it was 2 years ago.  I then had the beef tenderloin which was great but again not very different from 2 years ago.  In fact what was changed was not very positive.  I remember a very well developed flavorful lobster bisque type sauce coming with the beef 2 years ago. This time it was an au jus sauce that was barely noticeable on the plate.  It came with 2 or 3 little fingerling potatoes and 4 pieces of asparagus. Hardly a filling main.  For desert I had the summer berries and sherbet. Sherbet was smooth as silk and bursting with flavor but the berries were just berries. Some (raspberries) were actually pretty bitter.  So, overall a decent meal but I wish they would get a little more inventive and bold with their menu. I understand it's Summerlicious but even the regular menu is starting to get kind of old. 

Service is good. Food is above average. Just needs some new oomph."}
{"text":"The food was great, but what really sets the restaurant apart is the exceptional service. They don't overlook anything -- down to the tiniest detail. 

The quail appetizer was particularly good, as were the whitefish with sweet pea risotto and the venison."}
{"text":"Too much hype about this place.  
Food service is good. 
Food taste the same as elsewhere.  Nothing unique about this place.  
Nice wine menu.  Nice choices on menu."}
{"text":"2.5/5! Unfotunately, we did not have a good experience at North 44. It could have been because it was a winterlicious dinner and the service/food was not as great as what's written in the reviews! I ordered the beet salad and steak- and I was disappointed with both. The only good part of our pre-fixe meal was the pumpkin cake for dessert. The service was slow and we were told that $1 will be charged to our bill for hot water & lemon. I do not recommend this place for winterlicious -"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for its name. I just like how it's named after the City's Lattitude. The food is not the best I've had but standard in this kind of restaurant. Service as smooth as silk. The waiters are always there for you but they never stare at you in your face and make you uncomfortable. It'll be a good night if you enjoy being pampered."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal in this lovely restaurant. Unfortunately I am very sensitive to sulphites and I was shocked to suffer after eating my meal. I never thought to expect this at such a well known restaurant .."}
{"text":"Top north restaurant. Classy and expensive enough for those special occasions. Food was really great, servings were comparable. Taste of the dishes was rich and full of texture. Probably the best stack I've had in years.

Ambiance was romantic and classy, not crowded and servers were extremely welcoming. Kitchen looked clean from our vantage point through a large etched glass panel. Clearly an outfit with nothing to hide.

 I'd go again"}
{"text":"This is my second time at North 44. I called ahead because my fiancee had a special diet going on at the time. The manager Elaine followed up with the Chef to have an off the menu item (dessert) prepared for us. Tier 1 customer service no matter how you see it.

As for the food, it's always top notch. North 44 is one of the best in the city, no complains here. Oh try the Foie gras appetizer, it's ecstasy inducing."}
{"text":"Loved it! Classy atmosphere. Food was amazing! Staff is professional and very friendly.
 I had on of the best Ahi Tuna steaks there and a latte with secret eastern spices was absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"Been a big fan of this restaurant, but today's meal was disappointing

The portion size was much smaller and price point is slightly higher than before, which would be fine if the quality of food maintains. However... The food did not impress us at all.

They used to make consistently decent risottos, but today's was way too under cook. Truffle fries did not have any truffle taste to it, black cod was under seasoned. 

We used to walk out of here and feel \"that was a great meal!\" But not today... ..."}
{"text":"With all the hype I was expecting a lot more.  The decor is bland (maybe even boring).  The service the table beside us received was very different than what we received (not better or worse but just a lot different e.g. specials).  

Good wine list by the glass which was appreciated.  Food was good but not living up to the hype."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite high end restaurants in the city. I have hosted many client dinners here in the past, as well as eaten here with friends and family. The food and the service is consistently amazing. It's a high end restaurant and the food certainly delivers on that expectation. One of the reasons why I think I like this restaurant so much is that while it is a fine dining restaurant, it also seems more casual in atmosphere than other restaurants in the city i.e. Auberge Du Pommier, Centro, Canoe, or Bymark. This will continue to be one of my \"go-to\" fine dining restos in the city... at least in the uptown area!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.

I have to say the food is really good on the whole but the main course didn't live up to my expectations. This place given all the hype and accolades should give you a dining experience that delivers in all aspects which it didn't. For appetizers I had the foie gras and some fig compote which was out of this world, then again I could eat 5lbs of foie gras and still want more so I may be biased there. After such a wonderful introduction, I was now expecting something to top that.......sadly it didn't. I ordered lamb, and that's what I got......lamb. I found it to be just alright, nothing special, and the texture wasn't melt in your mouth wonderful. I suppose the build-up from the appetizers may have had something to do with the let down of my main course but really, a resto like North 44 shouldn't be so hit and miss in my opinion. 

For dessert, I had the ginger bread creme brulee which I really liked and again I'm wondering how some of the dinner was stellar and some was so so (the most important part). However, service is great, I would be willing to give them another try but definitely it'll be during a summerlicious most likely."}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend with my wife and had what was overall a terrific meal, though there was a notable exception.

Service: Exceptional in every respect.  Took great care of us from the moment we arrived, without being overbearing.  Was everything service should be at the price point.

Atmosphere: A nice, quiet, reserved environment.  Some of the tragicomical blingshevics sitting around us were unfortunate, but there's not much the restaurant can do about that.  

Food: They went three for four on this front.  My foie was amazing - expertly prepared and delicious, with an unusual assortment of accompaniments that added to the dish.  My wife's starter salad was quite good - nothing remarkable, but she was very happy with it.  Her main course was truly exceptional - the veal was remarkable, the sauce to die for.  My main was the major flaw.  The ravioli was thin, watery, underseasoned and tasteless.  I wish I could say it was forgettable.  For a restaurant of this calibre, either a) the kitchen screwed up my dish or b) this simply should not be on the menu.

Beverages: Did a great job with a non-alcoholic drink for my wife, which was much appreciated.  The wine list was shockingly overpriced (wine that I'm used to seeing for $7 priced at $80), but the glasses I had were fine, and the table service was well-executed.

I'd certainly go back, but would stay well away from that ravioli"}
{"text":"went here for 2014 summerlious.   the decor is average, comparable to other fine dinning.  However,  the table size was small and we were being seated against the pillar.  feeling a bit uncomfortable when trying to make conversation.  The service is ok.  can be better from a fine dinning perspective. Ordered:

Steak Tartare
with fried capers, grainy mustard and fresh country toast

6oz Steak
with local asparagus and herb crusted roasted potatoes

Banana Strudel

the garnishes paired well with the dish.  The steak cooked to perfection, in particular the seared crust on the steak. The dessert was unique, not too sweet or over powering.  The ingredients are well balanced. 

I would certainly go back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque yum! Also try the squash ravioli"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Valentines day this year and were so happy that we did!

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly staff and were accompanied to the upstairs eating area. Our waitress was so incredibly friendly and funny and made our experience very enjoyable. I cant remeber her name however, I wish I did, she was great!

The menu was fanatastic. I usually dont take long to order my food but there were just too many wonderful options!


For starters, we shared the tagliatelle with lobster meat, which was incredbile! We also shared some curried scallops. 

The bison was absoloutely amazing and cooked to perfection.

We would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience at North 44.  The service was excellent and the food was fresh and tasty. I had the ahi tuna as my starter and it was not too fishy albeit the garnishings did not overpower the fish. I had the pacific halibut as my main and it was cooked perfectly and not too firm. The accompanying shrimp were also a good size and complimented the halibut well. The serving size was a tad skimpy but, not surprisingly so for fine dining."}
{"text":"Went there 3 months ago dining alone for dinner. Order a whole meal featuring truffles - mushroom soup topped with black truffle shaves and truffle oil, then duck confit with mushroom risotto, and some Port wine taster for dessert (only thing that had nothing to do with mushroom). Both the soup and the main dish were very flavorful and hearty.

Apparently this place was exquisite and pricey, but from what I got the quality matched with the price."}
{"text":"North 44 is a hidden gem. Having lived in the Y&E area for over 3 years yet having no idea North 44 existed. Fabulous restaurant, fabulous food and fabulous service. Repeat= yes"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious in June and it was fab.  Service was stellar and the steak I got was done well.  Portion a little small but that is what you usually get at a fancy restaurant.  Place was kinda dark for my liking but I guess it adds to the feel of the place.  Overall very enjoyable place.  Love the bread they provided you as it very fresh and still hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"I had my first North 44 experience for a romantic NYE dinner.  It's a favourite of my boyfriends but I had never been, so he took me there for a quiet romantic dinner to start off the new year.

I truly enjoyed every bite.  We started with some excellent champagne to celebrate the season while we perused the menu.  We had the tuna 3 ways and the gnocchi appetizers, which were both incredible, and the best part of the meal.  We shared both and both loved them.  I then had the Ahi tuna, which was delicious, although by that time I was starting to get full.  We shared several sides- the onion rings were literally the best onion rings I have ever had and I would go back just for those.  Whatever vegetable we had was forgettable and the fries were so-so.  The sauvignon blanc the server suggested to go with my fish was perfect.

For desert we had creme brulee and cucumber sorbet.  Delicious again although by that point i was really too full to fully appreciate it, and I probably didn't need the desert.

Overall the ambience was wonderful, the server was attentive and pleasant, and it was a great experience.  I will definitely be back.

The only downside- when we asked about beer on the menu, the server criticized the options they had saying she wouldn't recommend any of them, and saying that they are all bad. I thought this was pretty bad form."}
{"text":"Great winterlicious experience. Staff was on point and food was amazing. What stood out for me was the ambiance of this restaurant. It is very elegant and posh while dining but does not feel busy even though there was a lot of staff working. Very organized and punctual on food.


Mushroom truffle soup, short ribs and sticky toffee were my favourite and would definitely recommend those!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to try their winterlicous meal. The services was impeccable. I was also really impressed how comfortably they handled the changes in reservations. I originally called for a table of 8, then called again to change it to 10, and then ONCE AGAIN (I'm the worst) to ask if we could get a table for 14. They handled the changes with grace and charm. (Note, if you want a table for more than 10, you have to sign a contract with your visa number in case you don't show, or your numbers change. Just something to keep in mind.)

The food was really excellent. I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, which was probably my least favourite of the three dishes. It was good, but small, and the soy slightly overpowered the delicate fish. 

I had the short ribs main. There were so good I ALMOST CRIED. I kid you not. They were beautiful. The heavens sang. The angels cried (because I finished it all and saved nothing for them).

My friend and I split the chocolate pot de crème and the ice cream sandwich desserts. Both were delicious. The pot de crème had pop rocks on it which was interesting for sure, but I'm not sure it added to the desert besides the fun/surprise factor.

Winterlicious menu with two glasses of their wine for $85 with tax and tip.

Just do it."}
{"text":"My first time here was about 15 years ago with my friend Scott.  It was one of the first of this caliber and considered I high risk venture at the time I'm sure.  I've gone several times over the years and do like it very much. Out of the way for me and a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for.  Glad to see Its holding its own.  I almost always had the salmon without regret."}
{"text":"Elegant and refined, this restaurant is a great place for a nice classy dinner. Although nothing was particularly wrong about my meal, there were a couple of small things that I did not expect here. 

The food was generally good. We tried the tempura rock shrimp, lobster tagliatelle, and some oysters, all of which were delicious, particularly the rock shrimp - the crispy exterior and tanginess of the chipotle-yuzu aioli were a great combination. 
For my main course I opted for the dover sole, which was a bit disappointing. The fillet was roasted well, but overall the dish was too one-dimensional. Presentation was also not up to par, with the sole on one plate and the fingerling potatoes and beets in a separate bowl. Reflecting that, the dish did not feel cohesive or balanced and I felt a little let down given McEwan's reputation. The Sauvignon Blanc that my server recommended was quite good though. 
Dessert was fine; the apple crostata could have been a bit warmer and more crispy though. 

Service was friendly and decently attentive. There were a few times when my water glass did get dangerously close to empty, and I also seemed to end up with a huge amount of ice in my glass as well. 

Ambience is cozy and elegant, yet not overly stuffy or crowded. For fine dining North 44 is a good choice, although I feel like there are more innovative and creative places out there."}
{"text":"North 44 is our go to restaurant when we want a classy environment that isn't too stuffy at a reasonable (still on the higher end but not insane) price. 
All their appetizers are really tasty and you can spy several items on the menu that u can normally find at their other restaurants like bymark and one. 
Servers are always super awesome - friendly and professional as well as knowledgeable. 
I don't find the food to be too inventive but it's a good solid/classic menu and they do them well."}
{"text":"What a nice treat!  Great service, delicious menu and drinks.  A special occasion restaurant for us!

Oysters for starters - amazing.

Great bread, yummy drinks.

Hubs had fish and I had the lobster - both were delicious.  Portions a bit small, but so good!  (I don't usually love fancy restaurants but North 44 is an exception.  I choose this place over the 360 restaurant anyday!)

Lovely ambiance as well.  Hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and AMAZING service.  I had Veal 3 ways and it was killer.  The chocolate caramel dessert was great too!  If I am ever back in Toronto , I will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at North 44. The restaurant isnot too big which I liked and I was facing the kitchen so it was cool to see all the action.

It is true that the portions are small. I got the sweet potato ravioli and there were only four. However, they were delicious. The chicken main was also well cooked, but I can see why most people would not find it filling enough. The dessert was alright, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice place, right on Yonge.  Ambiance was very nice; white table cloths, couch seats, etc. etc.  Went for Summerlicious.  Thought the food would be better than it was.  I ordered the salmon, which was cooked med. rare.. Nice presentation, but like I mentioned, nothing truly special.  Not in a rush to come back, but would entertain the idea for an event of some sort."}
{"text":"Great food! Duck was excellent. Crab cake appetizer was mind blowing. Good combination of ingredients create this little spicy and yummy taste! Great service. Very classy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish.  Meals, service, ambience all top notch.  Spent almost 3 hours there - a perfect special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"North 44 is not the North 44 of yesteryear.  Despite its high end status, its attempts to become more accessible to the general public has surely been its undoing.  There is high-ish quality food, high-ish end atmosphere, condescending staff, and eclectic clientele and average time to be had, all for a remarkably low-ish high price."}
{"text":"Winterlicious- the time of the year that regular people get to try extra-ordinary restaurants. North 44 has been on my radar for quite some time. The place reeks of elegance, high standard and over all technical modern cooking. We were greeted by the host who took our jackets. I believe there is Valet service as well. 


Once seated- you are taken back by how comfortable the ambiance is-everything from the cushion on the table. Comfortable dining chairs, very low jazz playing in the back and the perfect lighting will bring the conversation out of the biggest introvert. Once the waitress introduced herself she brought 3 menu's. The winterlicious menu, wine menu and also the oysters/ caviar menu. While I may have not made in life where I am buying $250 dollars of caviar. I had to take a look at the Oyster menu. They had selections of 6 different kind of Oyster's from 6 different parts of the world. There was also a very descriptive literature on each oyster distinguishing how they will differ in taste. Oysters came accompanied with hot sauce, lemon, horse radish and their own North 44 mango salsa. UH-mazing!!! 

I went on to order the North 44 soup- which had a bit of a Indian taste to it. It must be the turmeric. Accompanied by the complimentary olive bread - it was a wonderful beginning. The other selection for appetizer on our table was the Ahi Tuna- by far the best variation of this item I have ever had. Usually the ahi tuna is in small slices. These were big chunks and the roasted flavor was so great.

For the main I got the Lamb 2 ways. Which was 2 lamp chops grilled to perfection. It was nice and charred outside- with a beautiful pink interior. It was seasoned amazing and there is no way to complain about perfection. However the item that stood out to me- as it something that I have never seen, tasted or heard of- is the Lamb shank ravioli. It may be common to a lot of people- however it was my first time. It was frikkin amazing- like the world's best Dim-Sum. I wish I could order an extra one. 

The dessert was a delicious cake that fell apart in your mouth. However- i don't have much of a sweet tooth. I loved my experience at North 44 was amazing. Looking forward to returning in the future once they re-calibrate their menu in the future (was a GREAT winterlicious menu)."}
{"text":"Yonge/Eglinton has a pretty bad rep when it comes to good places to eat.  When Centro closed its doors earlier this year, that made for one less.  The general guide to eating in the area is \"North of Eglinton bad, south of Eglinton good\"[1] - the exception being North 44)º of course.

Mark McEwan's cozy, intimate and romantic North 44)º is dimly lit with quiet lounge music in the background.  The walls are lit by stenciled grates like a baby's mobile beaming relaxing images onto the wall.

Oenophiles can delight in the extensive 21-page wine list along with a list of cocktails that range from stiff to smooth to sip on while deciding what to eat.  I opt for a Brazilian Caipirinha with a stick of rock sugar that makes any childhood sugar deprivation a distant memory.

It's hard to not devour the bread basket especially with the creamy smooth butter that comes with.

The MEDLEY OF LOBSTER with crab, prawns dressed in an orange sauce with watercress and spiced crème fraîche would make for a hearty entrée salad, but is decadent as a starter.  All the flavours just worked really well together.  Lobster + crème fraîche go hand in hand.

The manager sends over his favourite dish, TEMPURA ROCK SHRIMPS with chipotle - yuzu aioli and crispy lotus chips and we can see why he loves it.  Lightly battered and lightly dressed, it seems that the chef likes the citrus and seafood combo - but we don't blame him, so do we!

The BEEF TARTARE is served with a grainy mustard and crispy fried capers.

Moving on to mains, we indulge in a ROASTED BREAST OF DUCKLING with seared foie gras, wilted greens, truffled gnocchi + rhubarb compote.  The gnocchi are soft and al dente and its mild flavor profile contrasts well with the boldness and richness of the duck breast and foie.  No regrets here!

We also opt for the BEEF TENDERLOIN off the specials menu with a creamy risotto and corn succotash topped with crispy fried onions.  I am not usually a fan of tenderloin as I find boneless cuts to be dry - but you can always count on the McEwan Group to make it right.

Our palate cleanser comes in the form of a ____ sorbet.

For dessert I opt for a STRAWBERRY RHUBARB TART with milk chocolate sauce + crème fraîche ice cream which leaves me wondering why all ice creams aren`t made with crème fraîche?

It also doesn't take much to convince us to try the CHOCOLATE BOURBON CAKE with peanut butter mousse, candied praline and hot toffee sauce - which loosely reminds me of a sticky toffee pudding.  It is a rich dessert that sates me after 3 bites.

The pastry chef also sends out these peanut butter tarts that are a great way to end the meal.

I have always been a fan of North 44)º, having dined here many times in the past (mostly on special occasions).  The service here is always amazing as I wondered whether our server had a smile tattooed permanently onto her face because there wasn't a moment when she wasn't showing off her pearly whites.  Yonge/Eglinton for me has always been a strip of mediocre and overly pretentious restaurants that, try as they might don't meet the standards of fine dining - North 44)º however, is the exception.

{"text":"From the outside it is hard to peak in, once you are inside, the restaurant has a gorgeous layout.

Onto the food, I tried their lobster and their chicken supreme in my two visits, and both were scrumptious. Very appealing plating design too. Friend had the lamp chops and steak, said they were good too. No complaints on the dessert we chose, a mixed berry cheese tart, except I wish it was bigger.

Service is great, very professional, and located conveniently mid-town."}
{"text":"I went to North 44 for Valentine's Day. It had a very romantic ambience topped with rose petals on the table. 
The food, in one word, was AMAZING!

We shared a 3-way Tuna appetizer (should've ordered my own, it was that good).
For the main I ordered lamb Chops which was good, but a bit over cooked. My date ordered the seared tuna, I had a taste and it was perfection on a plate.

Buttermilk beignets: this is what got me to write the review. So many different things happening on the plate. Just order it, go there for this.

The only thing a little off was the service. It was very slow, and our waiter would often stop in the hallway to chat with the other staff while getting food..."}
{"text":"Mmmm...yummy and delicious!

One of Toronto's most well known restaurants - great presentations and a GREAT deal if you partcipate in \"summerlicious\" or \"winterlicious\".  There is no other way I can afford to hit up this place.  

The ambiance is cozy and trendy.  Great date place for a special person...!"}
{"text":"I was there for my birthday was extremely disappointed with the quality of food. The lady serving us was very unpleasant. I would not go back! Would not recommend it to my friends or anybody!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. I went there with my bf for winterlicious and their appetizer shrimp thing was beyond amazing. It was something I would die for. All three courses were wonderful and the staff were welcoming. Everything about this restaurant is so pleasant."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now and have been unimpressed both times...Don't get me wrong, the food is wonderful but better could be had at lesser prices and therefore I'm highly critical of what is served. I find the restaurant pretentious in nature and used as a showcase for McEwan foods and wines rather then a restaurant trying to innovate and make great food.

So far I've tried the Dover Sole ($65), rib-eye ($52), oysters and various desserts....I find it disappointing that the highlights were the risotto served as a side to the steak (absolutely wonderful though...plenty of cheese and yellow chanterelle mushrooms) and oysters...Toronto is a great city with a ridiculous amount of wonderful food at every price range...I don't understand how North 44 fits into this top elite."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Expert staff.  Disappointing meal. I expected more from one of \"Toronto's top restaurants\". The veal dish was imaginatively presented but so tough I couldn't even finish the tiny portion provided."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Do NOT go for Winterlicious. While the food was nice but nothing impressive, the service was more than disappointing.

I've been to many fine dining restaurants, and by far I received the worst service here. Don't get me wrong, my waitress wasn't rude or anything, but her attitude was unenthusiastic, and interestingly - she's obviously not a dull person because she seemed very enthusiastic and chatty when waiting on some nearby tables. What made it worse was that she spilled my cocktail (with her finger in the glass) and she simply put a napkin on the spill and didn't even bother to offer a replacement. You can expect how I felt about all these. I never tip badly because of high food price but she absolutely got the amount her service deserved.

The food was nice, warm and comforting. However, the portions were very small, and I got hungry after an hour. Considering the price we paid and the experience we had, North 44 honorably becomes the 1st fine dining restaurant on my NEVER RECOMMEND list."}
{"text":"Nope. No, no. No. Our manager took our team here when one of the winterlicious dealios was going on a couple of years ago. We practically ordered everything on that menu, and nothing tasted good. The menu looked good, but the execution wasn't there. After every bite, people would just shake their heads and use a gulp of alcohol to down whatever we ate. Our manager was embarrassed that he took us there, since he had boasted about good foods in Toronto and is a self-proclaimed foodie. (Luckily, I found those good food spots!)

1 star for the port sampler. As I recall, the group got 4-5 samplings, and it was a satisfactory way to end a not-good food evening."}
{"text":"What we ate (Summerlicious menu):

- Ahi tuna
- Mussels
- Duck confit
- Mahi Mahi
- Panna cotta
- Fresh fruit and berry bowl

I've been waiting to dine here for years, and thought summerlicious would be as good a time as any. Perhaps the summerlicious menu is not meant to wow, because there wasn't anything memorable about the meal. The food was solid - tasty and cooked well - but the two star rating is scaled against what my expectations were for this restaurant from the get-go (a white tablecloth, North Toronto dining institution). The flavours and presentation were pleasant, but even today, less than 24 hours after the dinner, I can't recall any of the details. Dining room was half empty, which seems bizarre for this type of restaurant during summerlicious. Service was good."}
{"text":"So I have a terrible confession to make: I hate fine dining. 

Okay, that's not exactly true or fair. I guess it would be more accurate to say that I fear fine dining, that it makes me quite uncomfortable and gives great anxiety. But it's not for the reasons why most people would prefer Applebee's to five star French haute cuisine. You see, I love getting dressed up and I relish in perusing an expansive wine list. I like trying new dishes and I'm fairly confident in my ability to pronounce all of those items on the menu with the fancy names and actually know what they are. So why do these types of restaurants fill me with dread? I'm a vegetarian. 

Glance at the menu at pretty much any fine dining establishment and you'll be hard pressed to find anything meatless. Even most of the salads are a no-no! Now I know that any good chef should be able to accommodate any patron but I've been told (by fairly reputable sources) that a lot of them don't care much for us crazy non-carnivores. That and the fact that I also hate having to ask for substitutions or order off the menu or whathaveyou. I don't want to cause any trouble even if I am a paying customer! 

So you can probably guess that a place like Mark McEwan's North 44 wouldn't be my first choice, despite its impressive pedigree. My girlfriend actually took me here as a surprise treat and although I suffered a mini panic attack as soon as I looked at the menu (the food, not the prices...she was paying, after all!) I'm happy to say that North 44 may have helped alleviate some of my fine dining fears: it was a fantastic dining experience. 

The service was excellent, not too aggressive, nor too inattentive. Both the chef and our server also made sure that my dietary restrictions were attended to by providing some of those dreaded off-menu options...my lady had called ahead to warn them that I (a scary vegetarian) was coming. The chef prepared a gnocchi in cream sauce dish, which was simply phenomenal. They're usually one of those things that I like well enough but have never been crazy about. These, however, were cooked to perfection...just the right colour and texture. They almost literally melted in my mouth. Far too often gnocchi are too heavy and doughy. This was most certainly not the case here. Perfection.

While I may not be crazy about gnocchi (or at least wasn't up 'til this point) I am huge fan of crème brûlée (the Cadillac of desserts) and this was among the best I've ever had. It was a coconut crème brûlée and I'm always a tad apprehensive when it comes to the flavoured variety. But in this case the coconut was just subtle enough so as not to overwhelm the custard itself. Again, the consistency was spot on and the dish was beautifully plated. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention my apéritif, their \"Knob Creek Sour\", which was also masterful...one of the best whiskey (or Bourbon in this case) sours I've ever had. My girlfriend had the streak for dinner, cooked rare and she enjoyed her meal as much as I did. 

Now I'm not sure what the bill came to (and I'm not sure I want to know) but I think North 44 is a pretty safe recommendation...even for scaredy cat vegetarians like me."}
{"text":"Intimate ambiance. The service was patient, helpful and friendly.  The food was exquisite.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite !!! I may be biased as the experience was heightened by good company :p

The decor and ambiance are gorgeous, classy, with perfectly lined mirrors on the walls and nice street view, the feel is different from other fancy restaurants. an ideal place to ignite romance with class.

The service was unparalleled even for a restaurant at this level. The host and servers were young, but they were so attentive and had such good service and manners that made you feel like a princess. I would go again just for the service, excellent training/choice by management!

The food was exotic and tasty. I had ostrich with pomegranate which I thoroughly enjoyed. My date had duck which he liked, but I wouldn't have. I think we had foie gras for appetizer which was good. 

I went there 2 years ago I hope the menu and service are still as outstanding!"}
{"text":"A lovely Summerlicious dinner experience so far.  

We were sort of confused in the beginning when we were serving by our first server.  He disappeared after we asked for a drink menu.  We didn't know what happened but we were glad the restaurant manager re-arranged another server to us later though it took quite a while.  Our server was very attentive and professional.  He used a scraper to clean the bread crumbs left on our table cloth.  I rarely see this heart-felt service nowadays.

The food we had was well worth the value.  A truly good experience!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try one of Mark McEwan's restaurants, so I thought Summerlicious would be the perfect opportunity to do it.  This was my first Summerlicious experience, and I would do it again.  

We arrived for our reservation and were quickly seated.  My boyfriend and I ordered the same 3 things:  the beef tartare, the grilled beef tenderloin and the panna cotta.  

I have never had beef tartare before and always wanted to try it.  I thought this was the perfect opportunity.  I'm glad that I did because it was delicious.  The flavours were just incredible.  We ran out of crostini's, and the waitress came by and offered us some more, good eye.  

The beef tenderloin was a bit small, but quality over quantity right?  Plus I was getting an appetizer and dessert as well.  It was cooked perfectly and just melted in my mouth.  I could have gotten more out of the potatoes, but they weren't the star of the plate anyway.  

The panna cotta was really tasty.  A nice, sweet way to end the meal.  

We had ordered a bottle of wine, and the waitress made sure not to rush us after our meal.  She was really nice and attentive.  She struck up conversation about Summerlicious and asked if we had been to any of the other restaurants.  I really liked her.  She was absolutely right, that I would want to come back again after Summerlicious."}
{"text":"I went here for a corporate dinner.  All I remember was, damn, this place is expensive!

I don't remember much of how it went, but here is what stood the test of time.  I actually still remember how it was

- Deconstructed tiramisu.  
It was the most confusing thing to eat.  I guess it's how fancy people eat, but deconstructing a tiramisu just doesn't work because I'm basically eating slices of banana, a piece of lady finger and chocolate.  I can practically create my own fancy deconstructed tiramisu and place them all separately, then charge crazy amount for it.

- Cornbread
I enjoyed the jalepeno it had mixed in it.  It was very tastey with random filling, not just plain cornbread.

- Seared foie gras with duck proscitto
It was recommended to me so I was expecting a lot.  I wish it had more contrast.  It felt like everything on this plate was one big foie gras.  I mean, what do I know, it was my first time trying foie gras, but...but, my coworker who recommended to try foie gras (in general, not from North44) said he had had other foie gras and it's usually not like this.  He understood what I was trying to say, so he validated my dissatisfaction.

- Tuna Threeways
My coworker ordered this and wow...I wish I did.  It was so fresh and refreshing.  It was an appetizing plate indeed!

Overall, if I have money to burn, sure.  It's a nice place.  I feel oh so fancy being here.  I believe they have a dresscode, not sure.  My boss just asked us not to wear jeans."}
{"text":"I have lived in Toronto for most of my life, been to the \"name\" restaurants due to the good fortune of having an expense account... but had not been to North 44 until last night.  It met the high expectation, and in some cases pleasantly exceeded.

It is very much a five star restaurant if the rating is scaled to the venue: a dive gin joint can be a five star venue if it hits its marks:  professional effective service, compelling atmosphere, imaginative menu, and quality food and booze.

That said, North 44 hit all the marks.  I was even pleasantly surprised that the clientele were not North Toronto snooty snoots, but regular people, dressed smart casual.  

Service was outstanding, as we were there for business, our server was appropriately patient taking the order, and waiting for the right time to interact with, not interrupt, conversation.  The menu, while overpriced, was imaginative and made for difficult choices.

I had a medley of lobster, crab and fish in a salad with mustard greens and rocket.  Fresh and plentiful.  Entree: Black cod done with a miso glaze, edemame, water chestnuts on a bed of bok choi with delicate potstickers.  Very nice.  The olive bread to start was fresh baked and very good.

Would I spend my own money here?  For a special occasion, yes.  The atmosphere was comfortable and the service outstanding.  And the food was very good."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious last night. The food and service was superb! I would give this place overall food 8/10 and service/atmosphere is 10/10. They have a nice sitting area around in the bar with a fire place and nice comfy seats that you can sit while waiting for your table. Overall I really like this place and would definitely come back for a nice dinner or special event. The steak, fruits dessert, and fish was very good on their winterlicious menu. I even like North 44 much better than Canoe and Auberge Du Pommier for Winterlicious/summerlicious :)"}
{"text":"My coworker reserved this place for Winterlicious.  The ambiance was classy and elegant and the prix fixe was a great value.

Why only 3 stars then?  The quality of the food was excellent, but I'm not sure I'd come here for the regularly priced menu.  We had:

-Seared Ahi tuna - the Ahi was seared nicely and the flavors complemented each other well.  

-Roasted Chicken - this came with a potato croquette and some honey mushrooms.  While the flavor was well done and the chicken was juicy, it seemed a bit unbalanced as there was way more protein than anything else on the plate.

-Pavlova - this dessert was okay, although the fruit was a little overly sweet since they had some sort of syrup on them.  i actually think if you throw fruit on a dessert, it should be fresh and not enhanced with sugary extras.

Overall the meal was nice, though not particularly memorable."}
{"text":"I recently dined here on a Tuesday night with colleagues for a private business dinner, and overall the experience was average. The decor is pleasant and inviting, and the staff are courteous and attentive. The food, however, isn't anything to write home about. Our menu consisted of the crisp artichoke salad or chilled cucumber and avocado soup appetizer, the steak with fingerling potatoes, or the arctic char with lentils and peas, and to complete the meal, either the sorbet with berries or the banana strudel with ice cream. Overall, the food was presented well, but lacked flavour, spice, and innovation. I felt that it was a dining experience that I could easily create at home where I could modify it to my liking, and wasn't worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Lovely ambiance - quiet but with a nice rumble of happy diners. Example of the level of service - we had requested a booth our previous visit (2 years earlier) -- they had prepared a booth for our reservation this time without having to ask."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks in town!

Very dimly lit, makes for an intimate atmosphere.

Valet available, but not free."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried the Summerlicious dinner menu. Food is not bad and size is ample but were nothing spectacular. Maybe we expected more quality, especially for a top restaurant in the area. Or maybe the Summerlicious menu wasn't supposed to be spectacular which kinda defeats the purpose of having people try what the restaurant has to offer. 

For the price of their regular menu, both me and my wife agreed that we can do better dining somewhere else."}
{"text":"North 44 is a top Toronto restaurant. Let me get it out of the way, it is super expensive but if you care for superb dining you get what you pay for. Also the atmosphere is just right. It is classy and tasteful. North 44 is a top choice.
We had fish and it was delectable. The bread, cheeses and wine were top shelf. We are now fans of McEwan. Oh you also have to try the gnocchi. Dessert was sweet but refined. Well done.
They need to expand their bathroom is all I would say they need to improve on. Theirs is showing its age."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the dinner here last night!

The seared sesame ahi tuna was soooo gooooooooood :)

We were here for Winterlicious, so cant really say about the prices, but the portions were fantastic for Winterlicious. I felt so disappointed with Trevor's WL offering and the last few WL restaurants, but North 44 really renewed my faith in the culinary event.

The crispy skin chicken was well cooked, and the salmon my friend had was huge! Fantastic portions for the entrees! The dessert was a bit to be desired, my sorbet was half melted when it got to me, i ended up drinking it.

Will definitely return for regular service, was very pleased. Winterlicious did it's job of turning me on to a new place!"}
{"text":"For what I was expecting, the dishes we ordered were not bursting with flavor.  They had a very over priced wine list.For the reputation of the restaurant I was surprised the staff were not well versed on dinner etiquette. It lacked ambiance. Would not go back."}
{"text":"So I went to North44 for a Summerlicious event and I'd have to say it was mighty disappointing.  The place was very old and rundown and upon trying to find the washroom it was down a creaky old stairwell with mirrors that had spotted stains from age definitely not well-maintained.  The food was bland and never popped and when I tried the wine there it seemed to be the bottom of the bottle because it was full of bits of the raisins and wasn't well filtered.  The service was mediocre and I wish that they wouldn't take so long to come by and see if we needed anything.  I would have to say my only high point for this dining experience was that it had a decent open kitchen too bad we were so far away we could only see it in the background.  I would never go back unless the price was lower and the quality was improved."}
{"text":"Been there for my first time, one of the best places in GTA!
Very recommended - Fettuccine with Lobster and mushrooms as well as the Bison steak, make it Medium Rear and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The steak was tough to chew. 
Was there for winterlicious and only enjoyed half of what I ordered. 
The salmon was good and the cheesecake was quite rich. 
However the soup was very plain. Just like sth from a can. And the shrimp also tasted like sth they would sell at fast food Chinese restaurants. 
The wine selection however was good. The reds were both delicious. 
Service was also great."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. Food was nothing extraordinary and a cup of tea for $8! We were a group of 8 people and tried a few different appetizers, mains and desserts. Spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with 2 of my girlfriends to try it out. One of my gf is planning on having her bridal shower here so she called and they squeezed us in (since it was all reserved for winterlicious) the lady that helped us (i cant remember her name!!) was superrrrr nice and accomadating and is helping my gf with planning the shower.
We got there at 8pm (our res time) it was super busy and went to bar upstairs as they got us a table. we ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio \"La Lot\" 2011, Peter Zemmer $45 and drank it while we waited. The kind lady/hostess came up to seat us downstairs at a square table in the middle of the restaurant. The place was packed and I loved it! We were served 2 types of bread, one black olive infused and the other white bread. Wow the black olive bread is REALLY yummy! My 2 gfs got the winterlicious menu and since I'm a veg I ordered off the normal menu. If you are a vegetarian, this menu isn't really versatile. My gfs actually had a good idea, they asked if we could \"double\" order the Roasted beet salad with whipped goat cheese, frisee and rye crisps 17.95 ok so yes over $30 for a salad, it was good but obviously not worth the price. The male server we had was a little strange, he wasn't really good and had issues understanding what we wanted. I also asked if I could order a side of vegetables - like how they are served w/the steak. He was like umm I guess I could do that, umm mushrooms or asparagus? I'm like I can only pick one? LOL he def was not a good server. He was usually busy talking to some other female server at side. Maybe he didn't like serving a table of 3 late-20s ladies? odd.
I'm ignoring this guy as a review the restaurant tho...he was just weird lol
the lovely hostess lady bought us the 1st bottle of wine, and we ordered another and 2 more glasses after. My gfs liked their winterlicious menu too! 
Overall, the restaurant was really nice, busy and tastey. I want to take my bf back here when he's in town. Can't wait to see how my gfs shower turns out!"}
{"text":"A very good 4.9

Had basic  artichoke salad, then trout. No fancy fusion trick here. Basic ingredients, but sooo good, perfectly cooked, perfectly executed, fresh and of quality.

Waiters were all very nice.

Not 5 because desserts were not as good compared to the appetizers and entrees. Caramel Mousse on chocolate cake did not make it for me. Would have been better with ice cream or at least freezing mousse."}
{"text":"5 star for sure I will be back soon everything down to the drink was delicious. This place is on the pricier side but it was worth it in my opinion. Service was fast and friendly also."}
{"text":"An absolutely fabulous dinner. Flawless service. My sauteed foie gras was unbelievable as was my lamb. My wife's tartare and tuna three way was also amazing. Expensive, but wonderful."}
{"text":"I took my wife and daughter to this restaurant two years ago.   The food was bland, and the décor passé.   I am resubmitting this review, however, because it was seemingly deleted from some other web sites.   The upshot:  my wife and daughter got food poisoning from the salad--which I did not have.  North 44 promised to send us a gift card for $150 to come back--but the card never arrived.   My wife and daughter barely made it home before throwing up.   For the prices you pay at North 44, the kitchen should have been surgically clean.   There should have been no cross-contamination of food items.   North 44 blew it in the case of the food poisoning and in their failure to follow up with the gift card for another try.   I would never, ever go back to this restaurant.   You can go to the Keg and get much better food, better service, and nicer ambience than at this overpriced, overhyped restaurant.   What a shame that Bistro 990 closed down, but this place survived!"}
{"text":"Very small portions, romantic, and extremely formal. You can hear the sweat dropping from the head of the guy at the next table.

The food I had was of a very high quality -- fresh fruits, tender meats, juicy veggies. Very well garnished."}
{"text":"I love everything Mark McEwan touches and my experience last night at North 44 was no exception. I first came here five years ago to celebrate an anniversary dinner and have wanted to come back ever since. So I figured with all the Winterlicious festivities going on it was a great excuse to pay a visit.

With our reservation booked (2 weeks in advance mind you) the earliest time available for Saturday night was 9pm and I happily accepted. We arrived a bit early for our reservation but the hostess kindly let us go upstairs to the lounge/bar to await our table. When it was ready she escorted us back down and checked our coats.

We were seated near the front window at a corner table along a cozy banquet. White linens and dim lighting plus a table adorned with candle light lent for a romantic atmosphere. The winterlicious / drinks menus were already awaiting us on the table to peruse. The waiter returns to go over the menus with us and takes our drinks order. He asks if we need a few more minutes with the menus however we already know what we want to order.

A warm fresh sliced olive and white bread plus a dish of creamy whipped butter is placed centre table. I love the briny tangy of the olive bread and cruchy crust of the bread.

For drinks I order the
Lip Sitck Martini - Raspberry infused vodka with muddled fresh raspberries and Champagne
Boy o boy was this baby strong thank goodness it was sweet tasting to balance it off but let me tell you I enjoyed it down to the last sip!

Even my date's Mojito was strong as well but balanced nicely with sweet and minty notes. So I can definitely attest that they don't skimp on there shot sizes.

Onto the meal, this is what I ordered from the Winterlicious line up:

Seared Ahi tuna with Japanese pear, cucumber, Yuzu and chili
The tuna had a nice light seared exterior with a smokey grilled flavour to it. The asian flavoured marinade the tuna sat in was a great accompaniment with a slight amount of heat.

Organic Irish salmon with beluga lentils, yogurt, parsley emulsion and crisp pancetta
The salmon was cooked more towards the rare side (which I like) and very juicy and tender. The black lentils  speckled with sweet roasted brussel sprout halves added some texture to the dish as well as the crispy coil of pancetta was a delightful pop of saltiness. 

Chocolate pot de crème - Chocolate and cherry cookie, toffee crunch
Creamy, buttery rich milk chocolate slightly chilled, I was savored every spoonful I wish it was a bottomless dish!

Even though the restaurant was full to capacity we never once felt rushed or ignored. Dishes came out in perfect timing and our waiter always checked on us and made eye contact with us even from across the room to make sure everything was running smoothly. The meals were beautifully presented and artfully balanced with a wonderful array of flavours and textures. North 44 is definitely an encore hit once again in my books!

The restaurant can be easily missed when driving by as the title is written in white on a light grey background so look out for a picture of an airplane which is displayed beneath the North 44 signage and more easily spotted."}
{"text":"I've been to North 44 several times and this is the first time I've been disappointed. The steak tartare was poor, the dover cod was decent and the brusell spouts yummy as always but the asparagus wasn't great and the duck was so-so and service was mediocre (and wine supremely overpriced per usual). For a $400 meal for two it definitely was NOT worth it. Will go again, but cautious next time for sure."}
