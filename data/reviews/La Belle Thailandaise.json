{"text":"The delivery man came to my house and 1st thing he says when handing me the food (which was prepaid) is that I hadn't given him enough tip. I was a bit shocked because I usually tip 10% for a delivery. It's what I was told was the right amount to give.  He didn't want to leave unless I give him more money, giving excuses like gas prices and how he came from the Plateau (which is like 10-15 min from where I live). I didn't have anything else to give, for one, because I was quite insulted and also I had prepaid the order for a reason (no cash with me). Then quite arrogantly he tells me people on the Plateau usually tip him 7-8$. That was like half the amount of my order! No way in hell would he ever deserve that much of a tip unless people order for 70-80$ worth of food.  What a douche.  I'm sorry but my meal was quite ruined after that encounter and even if it was good, I'll never order from there again."}
{"text":"Un apporter votre vin, un menu varié et pas cher et une qualité raisonnable. Je recommande de gouter le pad thai qui est excelent"}
{"text":"I rolled in this joint on a rainy Saturday after strolling the streets of Montreal for a few hours. A bowl of Tom Yum soup seemed in order. The place was quiet - it was sort of between lunch and dinner - so the soup came right out and it hit the spot.  The nice waiter and I had a good chat. I was full and warmed up  and ready to hit the street after. A good investment, I say."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and service is great for the price, which is SUPER LOW!"}
{"text":"recommend: grilled salmon+bean sprouts, coconut sauce chicken rice. very hot and fresh served. mango salad was average. enjoyed  it ."}
{"text":"Its ok i guess when u want something quick, but its definately not the best quality there is. The chicken general tao was a little too chewy to my taste, the pad thai a little blend and the fried rice was ok"}
{"text":"Shitty service again. FYI: Meat + fish = not vegetarian. As that one popular songstress opines: \"I'm on the right track, baby I was born this way\" ... I have been a life long vegetarian; born and bred. I don't know about you but for me ... not killing life (I know right, dat be cray) ... and not contributing to the suffering and death of living beings is high on my list of important key priorities for my continued existential wellbeing in this Universe/Multiverse/Illusion/The Matrix/Whatever. You might think so too unless you're some weirdo fascist psychopath; not that there's anything wrong with that ? I mean totally whatevs right. You know, Hitler? Hitler was vegetarian. Not all of us are evil genocidal megalomaniacs. Fuck! Isn't eating meat kind of weird? Doesn't it seem like a bit similar to eating people? It's like a chromosome or two away from cannibalism. Some non-vegetarians have a serious chip on their shoulder because they assume vegetarians have a chip on their shoulder. When we were first dating, my partner didn't even know that I was vegetarian for about six weeks until she tried to get me to eat some bacon ... which I prepared for her ... I also perform excellent cunnilingus so that might have helped? I aim to please! Some non-vegetarians (mostly bros ... you know who you are) be all up in my grille like ... what could you possibly survive on ... what do you eat ... how do you live/exist ... where do you get protein from ... are you a vampire ... did you do 9/11? And I'm all like: stop trippin' bro, have you heard of the natural world ... I know you know about the faunæ but there is also a huge selection of delicious and nutritious FLORÆ ... the world is our oyster? Protein? I hope you know that when you slobbered (no homo) all over your bro's cock last night ... that that didn't count as protein right? You got to swallow, bro, there's the protein. Santorum mmm mmm good. You think you're a big, manly, muscle-bound manly man because of that meat? Well come at me bro. I'm big too and I'm a herbivore ... I did that shit without animal protein ... just genes and beans, bitch ... so who is more of a man? Jokes aside ... seriously people, burnt carcass (or raw as in carpaccio or sushi) is not the only food out there. Be open minded. Try out meatless Monday. And remember that vegetarians are friendly and also people just like you. They walk among us. So nonviolence, 'ahimsa' and vegetarianism are my jam in food and in life. Now, I've been on the hunt for a really delicious and strictly vegetarian Thai green curry (as in one that doesn't have any shrimp paste, fish sauce or anything that was once alive and perhaps sentient ... besides plants of course ? ... I love eating those plants mmm so tasty; such delicious green skin) and even though that sumptuous veg fare was pretty easy to find even all the way in Thailand, it has, upon returning to Montréal about six months ago, proved a difficult and arduous task to fulfil here back at home. There seems to be a failure in communication when it comes to vegetarians and the denizens of the restaurant/service industry wherein consensus cannot be reached as to what vegetarian means. No, simply putting vegetables in a meat based dish does not a vegetarian meal make. The Oxford English Dictionary defines vegetarian as: a person who does not eat meat or fish, and sometimes other animal products, especially for moral, religious, or health reasons. It's not that hard to understand. Sounds simple right, nope. Just because I can't see the meat doesn't make it suitable for a vegetarian. Yes, indeed, there may be less than one percent shrimp paste in a ninety-nine percent vegetable based dish but that is still not goddamned vegetarian. C'mon, meat is meat; if it's inside your food in whatever minuscule amount ... it's still not suitable for vegetarians ... at least not this one. You pescatarians can suck on a Fisherman's Friend. After confirming (albeit in a confused sort of way) over the phone, that the green curry was vegetarian, I went to La Belle Thaïlandaise hoping for such a meal yet was met with consternation, attitude and passive aggressive tones and language from the server when I asked to confirm that the green curry was in fact devoid of any animal products. I was apparently a special kind of vegetarian ... a special kind of vegetarian who wouldn't even eat (unseen) shrimp in a green curry. Ahhh such aggravation for all parties involved over such a simple issue. Meat or no meat; it's a simple yes or no sort of affair. Don't spout all this rigmarole like how there may be some meat in there but it's okay and just a technicality. No, motherfucker, it's not. Instead of telling people at restos that I'm vegetarian, I should start saying that my strictly plant-based diet is because I'm deathly allergic. Maybe that'll help. The improvised dish that they cobbled together was not Thai food. It was more of a Chinese inspired veg stirfry. It wasn't very good. So. Fail."}
{"text":"I order from here tonight and when I took the food from the delivery man who came to my door, he came into my house and closed the door behind him and asked me to check my order. I am a female and home alone and that is completely inappropriate. Then he asked my for a tip which I had arrived given him with my order on JustEat directly. To add to that once I opened my order it was incorrect. I ordered Tom Yum soup without coconut milk and both of the soups I received had coconut milk. I called to complain directly to the restaurant and they just told me it was a good thing because the coconut milk was more expensive. And the woman from the restaurant didn't offer to change the soup and I didn't ask because I did not want that delivery man coming back to my house again. I called and complained to JustEat and they told me the delivery man was not from them and they contacted the restaurant directly to complain to them on my behalf. The restaurant offered me 20% off but I declined it because there is no way I am ever ordering from this place again.  I would like to respond to the below reply by saying I began my conversation with your personnel that your delivery man entered my house and closed the door behind him. That was the purpose of my call in the first place. I followed up that he requested a tip when I had already left one on justeat. Lastly, I mentioned that my order was incorrect. At no point was I offered a replacement soup or given a discount. The lady I spoke with just told me I should be happy because the coconut milk is more expensive. Justeat did my contact your restaurant to ask for a refund on my behalf but to complain about your delivery services. The justeat represented even mentioned that you guys have numerous violations including ordering a third party delivery service. That's for adding insult to injury with your terrible Yelp response. You should be better informed of the customers experience before posting accusatory untrue response. Be sure I will let all my friends know to never visit this restaurant or order from you."}
{"text":"I was between a 2 or a 3 star review for this restaurant. I thought to myself \"will I go back?\" and the answer is no :(  I am learning that authentic thai is not that easy to find in Montreal, but this seemed very very far away. My parents and I all went with table d'hote, which comes with a soup, roll, and main dish. We all enjoyed our soup - both the spicy lemon and won ton soups. The spring roll I had was impossible to eat - I couldn't cut through the rice wrapper and there was no flavour to the items inside. My parents also did not enjoy the imperial roll.   My dad and I both had the \"love\" noodle dish and were not impressed. The dish consisted of chicken, shrimp, and vegetables tossed in a not very flavourful sauce and served on crunchy noodles. Some of the noodles became edible given the heat of the toppings, but many around the edges did not.  My mom had the orange chicken which was again underflavoured, and the chicken tasted rubbery and perhaps undercooked. Strangely enough, the server asked my mom if she was sure she wanted that dish (versus the love noodle) - why serve something you are not proud of?  The service was good and prices were not bad, but the food was not something I would return for."}
{"text":"This is not the most refined thai food in Montreal but it's absolutely perfect if you're looking for something both filling and downright scrumptious.  The decor is perhaps a little tacky but it's so fun and visually stimulating that I actually kind of like it. There's lots of bright art on the walls and little statues. The top of the bar is in the shape of a boat.   This is a fantastic restaurant to go to with a group of friends. It's not too loud, but not so quiet that you have to worry about other customers hearing your conversations. The staff is so welcoming and they make a point of remembering you each time you go. The food is incredibly cheap...I'm talking $13 for a table d'hôte. Also, it's a bring your own wine. So you can go out for a great night and spend $20 including tax and tip plus the wine from the SAQ.   When I go I normally order the peanut tofu with crispy spinach or the red curry with shrimp. The pad thai is what you would expect at any thai restaurant.  I also like the cold spring rolls and they make the absolute best sticky rice. Generally the food is pretty greasy, but let's face it, sometimes that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the servers here seem to have no idea what's in the food. I was trying to find out whether there were dairy products in some of the dishes and it took a few different employees and quite a long time before they were able to confirm that they do cut both their peanut sauce and coconut curries with milk. So my friend and I ended up ordering a basil tofu dish and a vegetable ginger dish, but both were mediocre. We also tried the vegetarian imperial rolls which were dry and tasteless. Really wanted to like this place as it is BYOB, the prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is laid back and cozy. Unfortunately, the food was just not good enough to bring me back. I can't speak to the quality of the meat dishes, but I would advise others with dietary restrictions to think twice before trying this place."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and in the neighborhood looking for Thai food. We are so glad we chose this restaurant! Everything was delicious and service was perfect. Generous portions and the beef I had in my pad see ew was hands down the best beef I've ever had in a Thai restaurant. If we lived here we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Great thai byob place. Was here for a friends birthday dinner before heading out. The food was pretty tasty and the prices were very reasonable. The location is great close to a few bars and restaurants. I ordered the green curry chicken with eggplant and other veg in a hot pot, it was very good and came with a bowl of white rice. Our waiter was very attentive to each of our requests and it was a very busy night for this smallish place. Probably one of the better thai restaurants i have been to in Montreal."}
{"text":"Decided to order some take away as I was uptown and was hankering for some Thai.  One word of mention it is mighty difficult to find a Thai restaurant open at 4 PM but LBT was just opening their doors!  Most Thai places I searched all opened up at 5 PM.  When I placed my order they mentioned it would take a bit because they had to get the kitchen opened up.    Ordered 3 dishes plus a salad, (Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Basil, Vegtable red curry and the Vietnamese papaya salad).  I would say that the best was the Chicken Pad Thai and the salad then the vegetable curry and then the Beef Basil.  The Pad Thai had a great flavour of the wok and was respectfully generous with chicken.  The Veg Curry nada good assortment of vegetables.  A small (and little disappointing) portion of rice was given.  The Beef Basil was the least because I'm use to a very fragrant version of the dish  This was good, but I've had better at other Thai places.    Restaurant is tastefully decorated and nice Thai music was playing in the background.  They had a deal on Yelp for $5 off your meal or 15% but I asked if it could apply to my takeout order and they mentioned it was just for dine in.  I would return to this place because I thought it to be decent value for the money compared to my regular Thai resto.  They were friendly and apologized for the food taking so long."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. The service was a bit slow. But the price was reasonable and it was BYOB. For 16$ you get soup, a spring roll and a main dish. The Won Ton soup was very tasty. I really enjoyed it. I also ordered the shrimp spring roll and it was decent. I've had better and was hoping for more dipping sauce. The main dish I chose was a chicken, shrimp and vegetable on a bed of noodles. Super tasty!!! Definitely worth it for the price you pay!!"}
{"text":"Bring your own wine and beer....dun dun dun!  First time here, got their table d'hote special. The main course portion of duck was HUGE. I couldnt finish it though :(  Have to pay them another visit. They were sauteing chillis and the smell convinced me for a round 2 trip!!  They even offer 15% off to Yelpers who check in!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food in Montreal. If someone disagrees, please message me with a place to try and I will.  The problem I have with most of the Asian food in Montreal is that 90% are some weird fusion of multiple cuisine eg. Thai and sushi (Japanese) - thankfully this isn't one of those places.  I went here with my mate from Australia and my girlfriend (who's lived in Australia), so the standards were set high. I realise that in Australia we are spoiled when it comes to Asian food (given our proximity), but I still can't understand why is it seems like EVERY Asian restaurant has \"General Tao\" chicken on the menu?!? WTF is General Tao chicken?  We started off with some chicken satay skewers, which were good. We then shared a pad thai with shrimp (pad thai is the \"yard-stick meal\" by which all Thai restaurants should be judged - if you can't do a pad thai right, I'm not going to bother with your other dishes), a spicy basil beef dish, and a red curry with chicken. I can say that all the dishes were up to scratch. The basil beef wasn't quite as spicy as I would've liked (traditional Thai food will burn your face off), but there doesn't seem to be much spicy food in Montreal, so I'll write that off to catering to the local market. The red chicken curry was solid.  The only thing this place was missing was a green curry! I couldn't see it on the menu anywhere. I did like the fact that you can bring your own wine - BYO places are few and far between in this town."}
{"text":"La Belle Thaïlandaise is a cute little Thai restaurant a few steps away from Mont-Royal metro station. I ate there for the first time a couple of years ago, and then again last Friday evening. I am not sure why it took me so long to go again (perhaps it is simply the distance from home) as the food is quite good! The food was quickly served by a very courteous waiter in a comfortable ambiance. For only $10.50, vegetarians (like my husband and I) can choose from several great menu options; I recommend both the Tofu General Tao, as well as the Tofu Curry with Eggplant. Meat plates take most of the menu however so if you are omnivorous, you will surely find something that will please you as well!   While La Belle Thaïlandaise is not the fanciest Thai restaurant in town, it is, within its price range, a great location which offers both good service and good food. We had a good time!"}
{"text":"It's a cute BYOB restaurant near Mont-Royal metro, good place if you're looking for inexpensive   dinner place. The service is very polite and friendly and the food is good. Tempura shrimp was little bit overcooked, but seafood stir fry served on a large prawn cracker was nicely done. The decor is bit outdated, but the calm atmosphere is good for dinner with friends or family. Little tip to yelpers, the 10% discount listed on Yelp is no longer valid, as they have changed owners. That being said, it's still a good choice to go to if you're in area and have Asian food cravings but too lazy to go to china town."}
{"text":"last time i ordered a pathai and tom yum soup to go, they don't have the meal version of the tom yum soup so they charged double the price of a small one for a big one then i had to pay extra to add in noodles, it came out good but not the best."}
{"text":"Est-ce que je suis la seule à trouver qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de restaurants thaïlandais à Montréal? Et non, Thaï Express ne compte pas dans ma tête parce que c'est une version fast-food. Je parle de bons restos où l'on commande les plats pour les partager et où c'est vraiment épicé quand ça doit l'être. La Belle Thaïlandaise est l'endroit qu'il me fallait. Quand j'y suis allée, on a commandé les plats typiques qui nous permettent de dire si c'est un bon thaï ou non: un cari (rouge au canard cette fois-ci), un pad thaï (aux crevettes) et un boeuf-basilic-chili. En entrée, on a décidé de tester le poulet satay. Tout était délicieux et cuit à la perfection. J'aurai aimé un peu plus d'épice dans le boeuf et le cari, mais j'ai quand même adoré le repas. Aussi, les personnes de riz sont minuscules, donc si vous partagé des plats, pensez à vous assurer que chaque individu ait sa propre portion de riz. C'est aussi un BYO pour le vin donc pensez à aller à la SAQ avant de vous y rendre. Vous en ressortirez satisfaits, le ventre plein et tout ça sans vous vider le portefeuille."}
{"text":"I've been to this amazing restaurant 4 times, and it just gets better and better.  From the lovely and attentive owner and staff, to the incredible food, to the warm and cozy atmosphere. I can't wait for my next visit in the spring!"}
{"text":"there was hair in 2 Out of 3 of my ordered dishes. DISGUSTING - and I was given the run-around by the restaurant. Just Eat customer service had to intervene. I do NOT recommend this place. GROSS."}
