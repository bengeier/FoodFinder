{"text":"I loved this place. I usually eat at Mexican place down in the Strip and the guy there suggest this place (his sister owns it). We had fish tacos which are delicious and chilquiles- absolutely amazing! The service was great. Nice portion sizes at a reasonable price. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"California Taco Shop occupied this space until recently when the San Diego-transplant hispanic family that ran it, tapped out and closed down. (very bad location, imo.)  The food was positively delicious and accurate of the Southern-CA. style of casual Mexican food...  Edgar, the former owner of \"Taco Loco\" in the South side apparently took the lease over and has in the process, raised the price of everything $2-3 while at same time, managed to reduce the quality of food.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed after trying, recently.  (A couple friends have relayed similar feelings.)"}
{"text":"So glad to see that Edgar's has moved into the old California Taco location. Now I won't have to go all the way down to the Strip District to get my favorite tacos. The restaurant was clean, the service prompt, and both my chorizo taco and fish taco were fresh, hot, and delicious.  At the last minute I ordered a flan to go, and unfortunately it was not the creamy, silken goodness that I was expecting, but a grainy kind of chunky mess that had good flavor, but the texture was all wrong.  I will definitely visit Edgar's often for the wonderful tacos, and maybe give them a second chance on the flan too. Then I can bump them up to the four stars that they deserve."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place, probably because of all the fancified, pretentious Mexican places popping up, but this place gets my approval seal. The interiors and exteriors are colorful. The service is great. And the food is excellent. I had a sampling of their tacos, and all of them were good. I also liked their sopapillas, guacamole, salsa, and chips. I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"Again, the word \"authenticity\" emerges from the pond.  And I'm ready to anchor it to the bottom with a brick since I'm still not convinced that it is a real thing. Philosophical rants aside, Kay treated me to a tremendous ethnic meal this evening.   The ephemeral yet fondly remembered (including myself) California Taco Shop has been gone for over a year now, but another Mexican restaurant has since filled the void successfully.  Owned by the same proprietor behind South Side's defunct Taco Loco, Edgar's sits along frighteningly busy Saw Mill Run Boulevard, an area still haunted by the ghosts of The Levitske Brothers, which are slowly being exorcised, resulting in a necessary economic jolt to this quadrant of the South Hills.   A long, thin, daisy-yellow building is what you'll come across, and considering the somewhat dreary, mechanical stretch of the aforementioned road, it comes as a welcome shock.   The interiors are all the more vibrant and festive. Orange walls, smiling, pretty women, beautiful accents, Latin soap operas, Anglophone regulars chatting it up with the Hispanophone staff, and signs that read \"Si Se Puede Steelers and Penguins\" meet eyes and ears upon entry, immediately winning visitors over by warming hearts with a sense of community that recognizes no perimeter.   Tacos at Edgar's range between just $5-$6, and with an array of fillings that run the gamut from traditional ground beef and pork to veal tongue (lengua), lamb, and seafood, culinary adventurers may find themselves degenerating into complete gluttons as I did.   As you may have guessed, a quartet of tacos comprised my main course. Plated as if they were pieces of folk art, each taco was so ornate looking, I hated to spoil their exquisite presentation, but hunger took over, causing me to walk through them one by one with extreme prejudice, each of them cloaked in a maize tortilla and topped with a smashed pinata of  diced tomatoes, cilantro, queso fresco, onion, sour cream and guacamole. While all of them were hearty, moist, and well-seasoned, my favorite of the four was the lengua, its meat almost ethereal, engaging in elemental interplay with the earthy tortilla. All of the proteins were as tender or more so than filet mignon, and unlike Las Palmas ground beef tacos, Edgar's chopped chuck was not at all gummy.   We began with a helping of their kettle-proud tortilla chips, a duo of salsas, and a crock of good old guac. The red salsa had a profound, smoky, almost chocolate-imbibed flavor than haunted my palate, whereas the green salsa was much more piquant and refreshing.   The guacamole was interesting in that tomatoes and onions played a heavy role, almost outshining the avocado to the point where it was closer to a salsa than anything else. Nonetheless, I slathered it onto those crunchy, oily triangles like it was butter on toast and enjoyed stoking the fires of my appetite with them.   Dessert was a take on sopapillas. Garnished with crests of fresh (!) whipped cream, ribbons of chocolate syrup, and blobs of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, these were more like sugary, deep-fried tortillas than the puffy, hollow-centered pastry I'm accustomed to, but it mattered little to me for they managed to be a treat among treats.   The sopapillas would have been perfect by themselves, approaching funnel cake (ironically, we had something similar last night at Millvale's Sidelines) in taste and texture. The ice cream was nearly overwhelming, but somehow I got the job done. Despite it being served with two spoons, Kay was too caught up in her Tres Leches cake to be of any assistance. However, I did have an offers from strangers, its presentation arresting the attention of a couple awaiting a takeaway order.   \"Man, I want THAT next time,\" the male half mentioned.   So there you have it. Route 51 lost a fine Mexican restaurant, but gained an even better one to replace it. Arriba!   P.S. The service was conscientious, gracious, and made not one gaffe during our dinner."}
{"text":"Edgar's has dropped in where the Calif. Taco Shop was.  Stopped in today and the Manager greeted us.  He said they have been open 4 weeks.    The decor has not changed but the menu and owner have.   The menu is Mexico City style food.  We were seated and given a menu.  The Manager took our order.  Someone from the kitchen delivered our food.  There was some chips and salsa samples at the counter that we were told to take a sample.   There were 6 different salsas that they sell to take home, too.  All the salsas are made at the restaurant with fresh ingredients.    The menu has Burritos, Tacos, Tostada, some Mexican sandwiches, some entrees and Combo's.   There was a daily special.  The burritos start at $9 and are large.  I had a Barbacoa..Lamb.  The Manager was happy to explain the menu, said the lamb was very good and popular in Mexico.  It come with beans, rice, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream.  A side salsa choice of medium or spicy is given to you to go with the meal.  The burrito was very good!  Better than the burrito I had when this was the Calif. Taco Shop.    Drinks consist of Mexican pop/soda some homemade aqua fresca and the menu said ice tea..but none available when it was ordered.   A TV had ESPN deportes on but the sound was muted.   Here's to your success...Edgar!"}
