{"text":"I haven't ordered Chinese food in a long time and had a craving this weekend.  I ordered from the closest place to my house hoping for a winner.  The goal with Chinese restaurants is finding the gems within the overwhelming menus.  I did not get lucky when choosing the dishes.  I should have read the reviews to see what was good, but I didn't and paid the price.  Don't order the crispy beef or General Tao, both were flavourless."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Bloor West area. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have tried many Asian style restaurants around the city all my life. I really love the cozy feeling of Regal Garden, its a cute little restaurant staffed by some of the nicest people you will ever meet in Toronto : )
I like to take my girlfriend to dine here every chance I get, they have a large selection of many known chinese dishes like General tao chicken and the best juicest chicken balls fried just right. But what I really love is their Garlic Chicken try it for yourself. My girlfriend LOVEs their fresh seafood and cheap lobster. 
The food is cheap, tastes great what more can you ask for? YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. 
IT is ABOUT TIME Ktown had a decent Chinese restaurant such as Regal Gardens! TERRIFIC!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - totally bland & dry general Tao's, no spice. Beef & snow peas had no flavor. Dumplings were rubbery. 
None of the orders came with rice, which I feel like should be something that they alert customers to. Maybe that is more of an issue with Just Eat, the ordering site. 
Unfortunately I won't order from them again, even though we live a few blocks away."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! Been coming here for years :). A real taste of Chinese food with affordable prices. They have a variety of food to choose from from the menu including 6 or 7 dollar all day specials! This is one of my favourite Chinese food restaurants. Also the owners are extremely kind and funny. I always leave with a smile on my face :)"}
{"text":"I originally planned to give this place 5 stars but the last time we ordered take-out, we got General Tao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. We could NOT tell the difference. I know it's take-out, and I can't sincerely say I'm a connoisseur of Chinese/Chinese take-out when my primary staying alive foods are protein bars, potato chips, and BLTs, but meat shouldn't be /that/ homogenous.

That said! The rice portions are huge - I made a large order last for 2 sizeable meals and be a side for 4 other meals. The food is still pretty tasty. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it's convenient, and the prices are - for the most part - really good. Service is also always very quick."}
{"text":"I love their food and prices. Perfect for take out. Its the only restaurant i know that charges less for Take Out vs Eating in the restaurant ... lol.."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for good delivery restaurants in my neighbourhood...this has been a challenge for years. Love the food here...tasty, fresh, nice selection of dishes, good portions & prices. They also have some dishes offered at $2 if your order Is $30 or more. I have a lot of food allergies and it's never been a problem. The food has been consistently delicious...I will be ordering regularly :)"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese place on the outskirts of Koreatown.  I first saw this place last year after having dinner across the street at Banjara and when I went back to Toronto recently for a visit, I decided to give this place a try.  I tried the Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce (nicely cooked with a good amount of garlic), stir fried rice noodle with beef (piping hot and mounds of noodles but the beef was a little on the chewy side), and stir fried chicken with ginger and green onion (pretty good but I wish they had minced the ginger rather than putting in huge pieces).  For those with gluten sensitivities, they can make dishes gluten free if you ask for it which is always a plus.  Pretty nice restaurant overall.  It's not the best Chinese in Toronto by a long shot but there are few Chinese restaurants in this particular neighbourhood (that I saw at least) so it fills the void quite nicely."}
{"text":"Great food with reliable delivery service.
I always go there for my lunch or delivery when I have relatives visiting."}
{"text":"My go-to for Chinese delivery. Number one selling point...NO MSG! For an allergy ridden pale child of the 80's this is what keeps me comin' back to this great spot. I can eat a full plate of their perfectly seasoned and very fresh sweet and sour pork, beef chow mein and beef and broccoli with no itchy skin and sleepless nights. Food always arrives hot, fresh and earlier than expected. My boyfriend is Chinese and I must say he has almost come close to suggesting that this is better than his mom's home cookin' (sorry mom). All jokes aside, a great spot for delivery Chinese in the hood. I'd pick this over anything in china town any day!"}
{"text":"Great place!

Amazing food, quality, portions, style, presentations, tiny place, great servers.

The main star of this restaurant is Rui, an elderly server with a heart of gold and fast as a bullet.

Kudos to the place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Canadianized Chinese restaurants (I know, I know....I probably need to return my Chinese card for saying that I actually LIKE a place like this).  Their fried rice has a decent amount of egg in it - unlike many Canadianized/fake Chinese food restaurants - and the chicken balls are not just about the batter.  They're a very generous size, too.  What could be a bit better is flavouring in some of their main dishes (especially chicken with mushrooms).

Note:  I have never eaten in the restaurant.  This is based on delivery via Just-Eat."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, ended up being another non-memorable night of mediocre yet adequate chinese food.

Curry samosas were a surprising winner for apps over the egg rolls (good), spring rolls (average) or chicken wings (crappy). For mains, General Tao Chicken was a large portion with decent flavour but no no veggies (not a dealbreaker, but the best general tao usually has broccoli sat least). Singapore Style Vermicelli were bland and lacking in pork, won't be ordering those from here again."}
{"text":"They are great! Love the food, delivery is reliable."}
{"text":"Well this review has been a long time coming. I was looking for a good local Chinese delivery as i was tired of getting bad quality food from other restaurants local to me, the problem with Chinese take out unlike Pizza if the food is bad its REALLY bad, however a bad pizza you can live with.

Visited Yelp and looked up all the restaurants in my area and read a few reviews the thing that caught my attention was the no MSG huge factor for me.

Called the restaurant and placed my order, It was the Sweet and sour pork, steamed Chinese Broccoli and  some spring rolls. I have tried other dishes since everything is very good have never been disappointed.

This restaurant has been a regular occurrence pretty embarrassing when I went on holiday for a week and then called up to order and the guy on the phone asks where i was last week. 

Overall excellent food and fast delivery.  I would strongly recommend this to any one that wants Chinese food and has sensitive stomach issues the food is never greasy always fresh and the portions are HUGE.

Value for money and quality."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty decent now they have changed ownership and moved locations and it's not tge same not to mention the food is more Thai style and not Chinese anymore not that Thai is bad but it's advertised as Chinese so ya"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my sister's house (litterally like 60 ft away!) and every single time we visit Canada I can't wait till the following meal time to casually suggest we order takeout from here. It's not that it is THE best Chinese food in downtown Toronto, but they make all my takeout favorites very well (deep fried squid with spicy salt, deep fried pork chops with spicy salt , yeung chow fried rice, singapore noodles, my BILs fav - shrimp with eggplant). Add to that the fact they offer a $3 coupon from their menu, pick-up is less than 4 minutes there/back, and they cook the food the way we like it if we remember to ask (extra crispy on the fried stuff) they're golden in my book. Just remember they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my wife, we ordered Cantonese chow mein and general Tao's chicken. They tried twice to make us crispy ginger beef an off the menu item, the first was too salty and the second was tasteless. All the dishes were horrible, I ended up throwing up eating just a little bit of each dish."}
{"text":"i went to this sorry excuse of a restaurant on wednesday october 18th 2017 and got food poisoning the next day I threw up so hard i popped blood vessels in my eye i would not wish this on my worst enemy. DO NOT EAT HERE just pay the extra and go somewhere else. The rice looked dark and not fresh... and the food had a weird smell to it {FOOD POISON ALERT}"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. The prices were good-- the food was great -- the waitress was AWESOME. 

The place didn't look too busy, but we decided to try it out -- it was delicious! So Fresh. I've been here twice, and I will go back again.

The only reason why I give this place 4/5 and not 5 is the place itself. They're still renovating/changing the restaurant and were painting while we were eating! Right beside us! It looks a little cluttered -- in my opinion, they should have waited until the restaurant was completely finished before opening it's doors again."}
{"text":"If you work from home, and you're up against a deadline/you don't want to put on pants, these are the two greatest words in the English language:

Lunch. Delivery. 

Regal Garden knows this, thus knowing the way to my scruffy heart. Getting me deep fried dumplings, fried rice and hot and sour soup in a timely manner on the cheap without fail at all hours of the afternoon. It's their thing. 

They don't use any MSG, which oddly kind of makes the dumplings suffer. I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I think my Canadian pallet just really loves that gland-swelling salt.

PANTSLESS PEPPER: I've never actually been inside Regal Garden."}
{"text":"For me to like a Chinese restaurant takes a lot; my philosophy - why pay for Chinese food when either I can make it or my parents can make it?  But when the aforementioned is not possible, Regal Garden delivers.  The combos are decently priced and they have a great selection of dishes from my motherland.  

PS. they do not use MSG, so if you are looking for that full robust Chinese flavour and is just getting the kung, without the PAO! (see what I did there?) then you may be a tad disappointed."}
