{"text":"The pho tastes good I won't lie.. yet I could feel an overload of MSG causing major discomfort, dizziness and headache.. I won't be eating here again considering that msg is poison.. no thanks"}
{"text":"Great pad thai and pork vermicelli! Their spicy pepper is also superrrrrr spicy in the banh mi"}
{"text":"Went with lemongrass pork sandwich. It was just an average sandwich. I like the bread they use here but the meat didn't have much flavor to it. Not much of the jalapenos or pickled carrots & radish either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a solid 5 stars after having a bite of their bread. I just can't give them more then 4 because there was literally four slices of cold cuts but it tasted really good! The service was very slow. I was the only person waiting after my order and it took them 10 minutes assembling my banh mi. I got the classic 10'inches. Prices are ok at 4,89$ plus taxes. It's too bad because their baguette is just perfectly  right! I will return and give it another try though. Maybe try their pork or chicken next time :)"}
