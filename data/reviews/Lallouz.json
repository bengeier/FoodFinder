{"text":"We arrived for dinner on a weekend. Friendly service despite it being very busy. Great patio with fun ambience.  Inside is a nice room with a Dj spinning. Great kebabs and mixed platters with lovely flavor combinations.  We will come back!"}
{"text":"Resto fermé, désolé"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. The portions were the size of appetizers for the price of a main, the meat was overcooked and so dry and flavourless that it was un-edible. Save your money and go almost anywhere else in the city, this place was beyond bad."}
{"text":"Je ne suis jamais allée à celui sur St-Zotique, mais plusieurs fois à celui sur St-Laurent. Je n'ai jamais été déçue, les salades en entrée sont toujours exceptionnelles, particulièrement la salades d'aubergines ainsi que la salade de chou-fleur. Les kebabs sont très bons, et les falafels sont délicieux. La limonade maison est très rafraîchissante! Je suis contente de pouvoir aller dîner là-bas souvent!"}
{"text":"I took my mom there because she's gluten intolerant and she saw on the internet that they had a special menu. The waiter had a condescending attitude towards us as soon as we walked through the door. We were the only clients there but he didn't greet us and barely acknowledged our presence. When he finally came to hand us the menu, he didn't give a damn about my mom's intolerance and was really rude about it. When I started to get impatient he told me to \"breathe\". Needless to say that we left without ordering and on rather bad terms."}
{"text":"J'ai visité, il y a quelques semaines, le restaurant Lallouz (la succursale sur St-Laurent). J'ai adoré! J'y suis allée dîner, alors je ne sais pas ce que ça a l'air le soir, mais le midi, la qualité/quantité/prix est imbattable! On mange bien, on se sent chez soi et il y a plein de salades à volonté! Tout est délicieux! J'en ai repris tellement de fois! Pour ceux qui voudrait un aperçu plus complet, vous pouvez consulter mon blog (la boufferie)."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place. We wanted a special meal to make our evening in Montreal perfect - and we found it!  The host and the owner met us at the street and talked about their recommendations. They were so nice and warm, we couldn't go anywhere else. The opening \"salad plates\" were incredible, especially the outstanding hummus!  I had the schnitzel, which was really great. But the real hit was my partner's steak kabob. Wow!  It was a great meal, great house wine, and the nicest people. We're going back next time!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and luckily we had a reservation because it was a full house. Took the 13,50$ lunch which was absolutely delicious but the portion was small for the price. I had an excellent falafel brochette & grilled feta. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went during one of the busiest tourist weekends on a Sunday afternoon. The place was completely dead, save for a table on the patio. I didn't understand the $12 menu option at first so I went in to ask, before being seated. After deciding it sounded like a good idea, I asked to get seated on the patio, and the waiter indicated that I could go ahead and pick a seat. After waiting over 5 minutes and having the waiter look right at us, he still didn't come and ask our orders, like we didn't even exist.  A few moments later, someone tossed a burning cigarette butt onto my lap from a window above - not the restaurant's fault I know, but that did it for me and we left without even being served.  The wait staff should really pay more attention to the customers and serve them when they're at a table."}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte, beau local avec tableaux aux murs, on se croirait dans une mini-galerie, bon choix de salades/légumes du jour dans des petits bols (illimités) en entrées + pita, le mix grill est bon + un verre de vin,  on passe une belle soirée ici ! J'y retournerais !"}
{"text":"Explosion de saveurs, grand choix de grillades cuites et assaisonnés à la perfection, même pour les végétariens! Service impeccable."}
