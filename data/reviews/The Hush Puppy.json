{"text":"I like Hush Puppy, my husband does not.  The atmosphere here could not be cuter- it looks like a log cabin inside, with lots of different rooms that feature outdoor waterfalls.  Service is friendly and attentive and really could not be better.  Their hush puppies are far from authentic, they almost taste like grits or cornmeal that was fried and shaped into tiny ovals.  They do come with a tasty honey butter and they bring you a hot basket the minute you sit down.  Hush Puppy is packed during the week from 5pm on, so expect a wait (they have a large sitting area in the front).  They are famous for their $25 all-you-can-eat crab legs on Mondays, as well as other all-you-can-eat items like catfish, shrimp, and even ribs (around $12).  Entrees come with a trip to their old fashioned salad bar, which has macaroni, potato, pasta salads and coleslaw as well as tartar, coctail sauce and lemons.  Their fried catfish is decent, not overbreaded or greasy, but tasted a bit swampy for my taste.  Their fried shrimp are heavy and the fried oysters tasted like the ocean. The highlight was their seasoned shrimp skewers with fried green tomatoes and remoulade, which were quite good.  Entrees also come with their green tomato relish, something they sell by the jar at the entrance.  I'd recommend trying this place once for the atmosphere and experience alone, though their food is average and would not stand up anywhere in the south. It should also be noted that they have a drive through, which features the same menu items at much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is beyond awesome for down home southern food.  All made from scratch from the sauces to dessert to the sweet tea !!!  Awesome staff !!!!  Never have been disappointed  !!!!  Great weekly specials too !!!!  You'd be crazy to pass this place up !!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, this is good fish. When my husband told me about it I was skeptical since we do live in the desert AND on the West Coast. What do they know about fried catfish, right? Well, I was wrong. You've got to try it."}
{"text":"The BEST, I mean The BEST catfish, shrimp, hush puppies & sweet butter you can get unlimited or individual. Not to mention the allllllllll you can eat salad bar, their Cole Slaw is Slammin'.  I'm from NYC & have had catfish in many places around the country & I have to say Hush Puppy has the BEST catfish going light, crispy & not oily.  The staff & especially the owner are fantastic they really treat you like family.  If you've not had a chance to eat here make sure to go you'll be more than pleased & will go back often.  Hush Puppy the King of Catfish!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  Husband ordered a combination platter specifically to get some gator.  He received his plate with no gator.  When he questioned where his gator was, he was told that they were out of gator.  Um, hello? Why wouldn't they inform him of that when he ordered it?  The manager said that they wouldn't be getting any gator until the end of the month (this was mid-month) so it's not like they suddenly ran out.  Our waitress was nice but so new that every time we asked a question, she had to leave us to go find out the answer.  Made for very slow service."}
{"text":"I'm from the south and live nearby and want to pull in every time I drive by. I'm glad I finally did! I almost thought I teleported back to Arkansas in the 70s. Haha  Southern style fried catfish, hush puppies, cole slaw, collard greens, pickled green tomatoes reminded me of my grandma's place.   Friendly service, very clean restaurant, 70s style decor. No wonder their parking lot is always full!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am a Louisiana girl so the seafood is awesome...John, the owner greets each and every one of his customers....."}
{"text":"We were talking to a new acquaintance about 2 weeks ago and I mentioned that since moving from California, we did not know where to go in Las Vegas for some really good catfish  He recommended The Hush Puppy and said it was the best.  We decided to go today, and oh my, what a treat it was.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel right at home, even more so when we told them that it was our first visit. Penney answered all of our questions about the menu, and gave brought samples of the catfish (farm raised & fresh water). Penney is the greatest, and we did not wait very long to get our food served.  She checked to see if everything was okay and if we needed anything. We also met John Lopez, an exceptional man, that stopped by to see if we were being taken care of and if the food was okay.  John brought Chan more catfish and showed him how to eat cold slaw and green tomatoes relish (chow-chow) with the fish. Everything was so delicious, the catfish, salad bar, baked potatoes, fries, and the mouth watering hush puppies with the sweet cream butter. We were both too full to try the dessert. but we have already decided that we will be back on Wednesday for more of this delicious food and excellent service.  We are very pleased and recommend this restaurant to everyone that want great service and excellent food.  The prices are very reasonable and we will be back (weekly).  Kudos to the entire staff, including the chef....10 stars..."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Hush Puppy since I first moved to town in April of '75, believe it or not.  The food reminded me of home, since I'm from the Biloxi MS gulf coast.  The hush puppies & fried green tomatoes are excellent. I can remember when there was only one in town. If you like southern seafood,  you won't go wrong here.  You will definitely go back.  You also get a discount for pick up orders. Yum yum go get some ! !"}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all. The server did not refill any of our water. Food was not good at all. None of my kids like the place either. I would not recommend anyone here"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful. The ribs were great. The fried shrimp was good and plentiful. The hush puppies are instead of bread and were real good.. John gave us a wonderful piece of sweet potato pie a la mode. They aim to please."}
{"text":"Great place for Catfish.  Sitting down for all you can eat is cool but we like the take out.  My son even likes it (that says a lot).  Their menu isnt too complicated, but it definitely turned into a go to for my family for fish.  You can pay a lot more for a lot less."}
{"text":"This place was pretty disgusting. The only thing I could recommend is the gumbo, Other than that the food was bad. The shrimp was probably Tyson brand, at least it taste like it. My sis asked for fried chicken, waitress said they don't have the ability to do any frying. The waitress then offered chicken tenders, she brought out but we later thought, if they don't do any frying,how are the tenders, fries, shrimp and fish fried? Could've been all microwaved. Everything was cold. I would not recommend this place to the homeless...."}
{"text":"We were told of the Hush Puppy by a neighbor and were really excited to try it. We had 4 in our party and all four meals were bland including the hush puppy's! The food was too oily, and the presentation left me feeling like we were at a buffet. For the cost, it was not worth the money. The food did not sit well with us either. The waitress was busy serving the entire room and therefore was not attentive to our needs. She also made an excuse when we discussed a problem with the salad. She said that it was the normal cooks day off and just apologized and kept moving.  Sadly, we were trying to give our guest a real Vegas Food experience as they we're from out of town, and we were all highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic catfish fresh and juicy. Manager came by and gave me and my Mom a free slice of delicious sweet potato pie a la mode! From the south and this catfish place makes the cut. One of the best."}
{"text":"I have lost my mind! I just moved from Seattle and haven't had good catfish in over 10 years, until now! This food is exceptional. I had the catfish and shrimp dinner with cole slaw and chowchow. If you have never had chowchow (like me) it's a must have. Can I say it again? I lost my mind, this food was so good. I had to order more to take home for later!   I'm so glad I moved to Vegas and will be treating all of my friends who come to visit to this place... Now where did I put my mind ?"}
{"text":"We've eaten here once.  The food was OK enough, atmosphere was OK enough.  But will not be going back.  They bring you a nice size basket of hushpuppies, like bringing chips elsewhere, before you order.  We did not ask for them, just brought to us.  At the end of the meal there were a lot left over so we asked if we could get them packed up to go.  We were told no due to them being part of all you can eat. ?? We got them before we ordered any all you can eat dish remind you.  So I made a statement to the waitress to the effect of \"so they just throw all of those away?\"  And she replied in an odd manner, \"yeah, they just throw them away\".  Seems odd that a place would throw away a lot of good food they brought to you for free to begin with rather than let you take it.  Doesn't it?  If you do go here, I would recommend skipping the hushpuppies.  Would probably skip anything fried."}
{"text":"The best customer service I've received in many years. The food is amazing and John the manager is top notch.  I'm glad my amazing boyfriend suggested we come here.  ( first time). After today it will be my favorite spot. Tell your friends and your family... this is the place to eat! If you're not from Las Vegas but you happen to be visiting you have to come eat here.  FYI: John came to our table and gave us a delicious desert on the house.  I try to keep my reviews PG13, but in this case I do have to add that the food was orgasmic.  Try it for yourself..."}
{"text":"This place been around for ... darn many years. I only went there for Monday night All-you-can-eat-king-crab-legs-special :)  Monday plan is: 1. Light breakfast 2. Veeeerry light lunch 3. 5PM - get to Hush Puppy 4. Munch on their excellent Cole Slaw and Hush Puppies 5. Plate of crab legs - Plate of crab legs- Plate of crab legs ..... Plate of crab legs ... no I can't eat anymore ... plate of crab legs. 6. Loosen up belt buckle 7. Wash your crab stinky hands 8. Stop by Big Dogs brewery right down the street and have a microbrew ... repeat if you can. 9. Skip breakfast and lunch next day :)  You can order from the menu of course ... but we never really bothered.   Bottom line: for how much crab we ate this place was probably taking loss on us :). Forget casino seafood buffet - concentrate on the good stuff."}
{"text":"Not the best of southern food (I have family in NC and SC). Nothing special and super plain. The only thing that was good was the sweet tea, honey butter and sweet potato pie. We ordered the fried green tomatoes, hush puppies, cat fish and shrimp. We never got a refill on our hush puppies but that is okay because they are plainer than corn bread. You have to dip it in the honey butter for flavor. No seasoning on the rest of the food. If they just used salt and pepper at least in the batter it would be so much better. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.  Been driving by this place for years and finally tried it. Now I know I am not missing out on much."}
{"text":"There fries changed to breaded fries everything is pretty much breaded and fried. I don't need my fries breaded and fried also, they downgraded the fries to get people full faster with breaded fries cheap filler and they stopped the all you can eat crab night, big downer."}
{"text":"I am southern girl so I do not shy away the chance to get my hands I real southern food. This place came highly recommended by several of my friends and co-workers.   I did not eat in I just opted to go through the drive through. I had the catfish, fries, and hush puppies.The food is good but, I would say this place is a little overrated I expected a bit more.  All in all The Hush Puppy has good food for a good price. Definitely worth a try for those who like southern food."}
{"text":"What a nice find!  I want to bring my folks here.  There's a lot of fried food, which usually isn't my favorite, but it's all really great!  I loved the fried green tomatoes, and the ribs, which are obviously not fried, were awesome!  My wife and I got a full rack to split and ended up taking some home because we both really enjoyed the salad bar, and the ribs were delicious even two days later as leftovers!   Our waiter Hansel was terrific too - really nice, easygoing and attentive.  He recommended the sweet tea, which was spot-on, and kept me refilled at all times.   A great local spot - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The catfish is unbelievable! I hadn't had good catfish in years (i miss the south) and it was so refreshing. I also like how the salad bar is included! Will be back here again!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! First time stopping by here tonight. We shared the steak and catfish entree. Haven't had a steak that juicy in a long time! Cooked to perfection!! Can't wait to come back and try the snow crab."}
{"text":"Maybe the recipe has changed?  Maybe they have a new chef?  Maybe it was just that we both felt embarrassed by the 20 cents owed situation?  I don't know.    Since they now charge for sauces it would be a nice thing if they could ask the cashiers to simply ask as they are placing the orders, \"Would you like any additional sauces with your order\"?  That would give the customer the opportunity to add the cost of the sauces to the original bill and to pay for them with their credit card all at once.  I know, for me that would have completely helped my situation and changed my overall experience.  I'm just sad because this was my special place.  It was THE go to place for a nice family treat.  Mom and I both said we don't want to go back for a long while.  We both kind of lost the taste for fish.  It's a long drive from my house, but I will go back this week to pay the 20 cents that is owed.  I figure they wouldn't have made that young lady make such a big deal about it if they didn't really need it."}
{"text":"We loved everything we got there the frog legs was good the fish is delicious alligator was great."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious. Service was good. Server split our checks even though we were a party of 6. Couldn't help but see the tears in her eyes when she came back to our table from being yelled out loud obscenities from whom I believe was the manager.  Heard it when we were leaving the bathroom shocked at the least."}
{"text":"Tonight was ALL YOU CAN EAT ~ Ribs,Shrimp & Catfish with Salad Bar TOO... for only $13.95... way stuffed.. Service was Amazing ... They also have gumbo, frog legs and alligator... a must try next visit ...YUMMY..."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant! Went here for a birthday dinner of a friend. 2 people had the ribs, 1 had the crab legs and 1 had the steak. The salad bar is extremely limited and the smell of sewage was horrible in the salad bar area. The service was not very good either. The waitress gave us a menu and right then already asked if we were ready to order. Like they were trying to get us in and out in minutes! During dinner the waitress told the person eating the crab legs that he was doing it wrong and insisted on literally showing him how to eat them! The french fries were horrendous, obviously having been fried in very old oil, making them greasy and with a nasty taste. This is a good place to avoid!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Food is great. Catfish is amazing. never had a problem with the food, However the service is always slow. Not mean but slow. Like they stay in the back and you dont even see then for 5 minutes or so. But food is great. A must go"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at this place. The restaurant is always pretty packed, especially on Mondays when they have the all-you-can-eat crab legs special. They have an all-you-can-eat salad bar, and a great fun menu with things like alligator tail and frog legs. We had to try both of those items and I must say they were actually pretty good. Everything is battered,  fried and super unhealthy, I'm sure, but the catfish is absolutely to die for. They actually have a drive-through order option which is really convenient, but my only complaint is that once I ordered catfish and fries and instead got a catfish sandwich and I was expecting to get some hush puppies on the side (standard on every order) but they were missing from my to-go bag. I would say definitely come here for the food, and expect polite service, and moderate prices, but also expect it to be very loud and crowded inside. This is indeed Las Vegas! The food is very worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  I REALLY did.  My husband is from Arkansas and I lived in the south much of my life.... so finding out there was a Southern restaurant in Vegas made us very excited.  I also love crab legs so I was doubly excited to try the AYCE on Monday night.  I have to say that the crab legs were probably some of the absolute best crab legs I've ever had.  They were very meaty.... no flimsy ones in the bunch (and believe me, we ate a BUNCH!).  Our waitress was also very nice.  That's where the good part stopped, though.  The restaurant itself is in dire need of a good cleaning.  It feels dingy and dirty.  We were seated right by a \"waterfall,\" which was a joke.... just embarrassing, really.  PVC pipes barely pushing out a trickle of water into a cement tub of chipped paint.  I think they would be better to just board up the windows so no one could see that thing.  The salad bar is pretty much a joke too.  As others have mentioned, it doesn't have a whole lot of items on it, and those that are, are questionable.  Not exactly fresh looking.  And with a name like the \"Hush Puppy,\" I would expect some REALLY GOOD hush puppies, but no... they were just pretty \"meh.\"  Maybe if I were in the mood for crab legs, I'd go back... but really there are enough places in town that serve pretty good crab legs and also have a nice ambiance...  I'd probably just go to one of those instead.  Still looking for a great Southern place here in Vegas..."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Maybe at one time they were good but not any more. Maybe too many have lost their taste buds and dont know when something really has flavor and taste but even if you dont have very sophisticated taate buds the food here is boring and a disappointment."}
{"text":"Blackened catfish - very moist, great flavor, the best. But then there is the fried catfish. Both really good, tough choice. Great food. Great service. Well worth the trip; we will be back."}
{"text":"I had a chance to try this place while I'm visiting. The customer service was excellent. John Lopez, the manager, greeted us personally. The food was great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment on random occasions for 15 plus years.  went back last night with a craving for their corn-meal breaded catfish.  as luck would have it, sunday nites are all you can eat catfish and breaded shrimp.  fried heaven, here i come. the decor is, meh, fake waterfall, unkempt outside, not one of those, whoa, eat and be seen kind of places, but it has been in business for alot of years owing to the quality of food they serve.  service was mediocre at best, just as you'd expect at a long-term mom and pop place in vegas that felt confident it no longer had to compete with places on the strip we ordered the all you can eat for the night.  we were first served with hush puppies, now conveniently fried \"bulllet-shaped\". WTF? what happened to the old fashioned deep fried, round-shaped balls of corn meal and goodness they used to serve?  i guess the kitchen finally got automation and now they come out like artificially formed mini-hot dogs.  the upside is they are served with honey-sweet butter, perfect for dipping in.  on to the salad bar, the cole slaw was vintage, not too sweet, not too vinegary, salad bar was basic but kept thankfully free of the brown, lettuce and chunks of leftover heads that no one wants to chop up.  In addition, they kept the salad bar stocked and made sure there were no other \"add ons\" i.e. no plunkets of tomato in your ranch dressing carried over by some lazy careless guest.  i hate that.   the seafood was served hot with homemade tartur sauce. they serve all you can eat crab legs on mondays for what it is worth.  if it's any help, the tourists we saw on sun night who opted to order a bucket  were working to glean every piece of meat off the small crab legs  they ordered on the off night.  All in all for what it was, very filling, not at all romantic, and nothing memorable, but decent food that doesn't make you sick. that should count for something.  As a plus, the catfish is very well filleted, no worry about a bone, ever, which is good to me. Plus they have the recipe for iced T down, awesome! Last thing to mention for all you catfish/fried shrimp lovers $12.50 for all you can possibly eat on a Sunday night when you don't want to cook.   Along with the refillable salad bar. not a bad spend."}
{"text":"I remember going here as a child and thinking that it was one of the greatest places in the world. I appreciate deep fried food, but they take deep fried to a new level. For my taste, the food was too greasy/fried. However, the restaurant is very cute and cozy. The salad bar is great and you can expect to be treated with southern hospitality."}
{"text":"Short: Mediocre food at best--mostly frozen/premade. Is pretty run-down inside. AYCE is decent, but you're better off at nearby buffets for better food.  Long: My family has a long-time tradition of going to this place since since it opened in the 70's, and it's gone plenty downhill from there. I don't know if it has changed owners, or the owner just doesn't care anymore.  I've been here several times in the last couple years, each time a disappointment. The last time--last night, to this review--I came here as it opened and was seated quickly. Luckily, I was seated near the window because last time I was more inside and this place gets gloomy and dark without sunlight. Odd that it's only open at night. Walls have chipping paint--probably both aesthetically, and they don't paint the place. Plates and silverware is old and cheap.  The salad bar is a good example of this place. Canned food you can find anywhere. It looks like it was put up in an emergency with random places, and a couple coolers, but it's been like that for years. I've been to terrible small buffets with a better salad bar. Waiter was prompt and manager was kind, but a bit unmotivated and dull. It was Wednesday, so I ordered the AYCE BBQ baby back ribs with catfish and shrimp and fries for $15.95. Good price at the start. Was served their \"special\" hush puppies, which were bland at best. It's just fluffed corn-bread fried and served with a honey-butter. No seasoning, nothing on the inside. Just cornmeal. Dull and drab. At least they were free. My food came, and with surprisingly large proportions; half rack of ribs, a filet of fried catfish, and a couple shrimp with a side of fries. The shrimp were the butterfly/panko style, pulled from the freezer and fried. No seasoning, served burning hot. Catfish is one of the few handmade items on the menu, but it's just catfish tossed in cornmeal and fried to a whitish-yellow. Not a golden brown. Oh, and burning hot. No seasoning, not marinated, not even salted. Just cornmeal. Ribs are peculiar.  By how much oil was draining off them, I swear they were deep-fried, but then they were grilled for a second before being served.  They were seasoned... barely, as the seasoning fell off. I don't know if they were marinated or smoked as I couldn't tell. Perhaps they're from a bag, then fried and grilled. I ordered the sauce on the side, and good thing too! The sauce was a sweet, tomato base. Not bad, but reminded me of sweet-and-sour sauce mixed with ketchup. Fries were shoestring with salt and pepper. Not that crunchy.  I've tried other things, and it's all either frozen to fried, not seasoned, or plain dull. Nothing terrible or disgusting, but just dull as white bread.  I was hungry, so I went through a couple servings. Each time, I was served only part of the dish because the others weren't ready yet. No extra fries. And the return service was slow.  TL;DR: Is it worth it? Buffets in the area, either for lunch or with specials on the dinners provide better food. Someplace like the Carnival World buffet at the Rio. If you can't go that far, and interested in the specials... I guess go here. But don't go out of your way; there's nothing special here.  2 stars because you won't get sick--at least they can fry foods enough. Otherwise, I recommend not going here."}
{"text":"My family loves the catfish ( we all like it different ways).  My grandmother is a huge fan and takes company to eat there any chance she gets.  The all you can eat fried shrimp is also awesome and the salad bar offers a unique variety of items."}
{"text":"Must admit first time I went there was not impressed, that was years ago,but that would not b fair to hush puppies since back then I was not a fried catfish fan. Jump ahead 9 yrs later and my palete has grown w/ my waist size. Hush puppies has the best catfish I have ever eaten. The coating and seasoning reminds me of fried chicken which for me is a good thing, luv fried chix. I don't care for the hush puppies wrong texture for me. Gumbo was good and the salad bar is alright . I would go again , see u their"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. FIrst time when I was seven. Now i'm old and I still go there with MY KIDS.  Great value guys."}
{"text":"I am delighted to say that Hush Puppies is definitely worth going to lunch, dinner or drive thru.  The atmosphere is nice and refreshing you feel right at home.  The food is so wonderful all I wanted was cat fish, shrimp, oysters, scallops...Cha Cha...so good!  but ate more than I should...just couldn't stop...my girlfriend Bday  was Oct 7th 2016 and she had never been there before...the service was excellent and so attentive.... Check it out for yourself....guarantee you want be disappointed...  Respectfully, Margaret C."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! THE CATFISH IS WONDERFUL..The best I have  eaten  at a restaurant. The alagator tail is very good and th hush puppies well simply great. The owner came by to ask how I enjoyed my meal. Hey I am from New Orleans this is a must if you are here in Vegas. I live here I WILL RETURN AND BRING FAMILY AND FRIENDS OMG!!! The pecan pie,,,,, the Best yes, the best. The service is excellent. John Lopez was the man that came to my table, I think he is the owner Jura was my server she is wonderful"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been fans of The Hush Puppy since we discovered them nearly a decade ago.  Sadly, due to issues with my health and other factors we haven't been out to eat very much at all this past few years, but that is changing, so we were really stoked to make The Hush Puppy the place for our 10th anniversary dinner.  They still have the same great specials which drew us to them to begin with; namely, the all-you-can-eat shrimp and catfish, with oysters and clam strips added for only a couple dollars more on Thursdays.  Sadly, I think the quality of the seafood has declined in the last few years, but everything was certainly still palatable and the oysters are still my favorite.  My personal theory is that the destruction of the Gulf of Mexico due to the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster may have a lot to do with this.  Since their prices haven't increased much at all, they may be sourcing their product from China or elsewhere now out of sheer necessity.  They also no longer offer frozen margaritas or mudslides like they used to.  The alcoholic beverages are now only beer and wines and I'm not really partial to either, so we stuck with Diet Coke and tea.  The salad bar is also very limited now, and one thing which I found REALLY weird was that the only option for onions was whole entire scallions.  Not chopped up into little bits, but the whole 7-inch stalk from green end to white.  The pecan pie we had was good, but to be honest it was a bit overbaked.  Our server was a real sweetheart, and I had no problem tipping 25% rather than the normal 15.  I didn't get her name, but she was very attentive and friendly and earned every penny despite some shortcomings with the food.  I give this establishment a 4-star review in spite of everything because I think that The Hush Puppy is still doing their best to deliver good food at a reasonable price in spite of likely problems with sourcing product and the fact that the Las Vegas economy is in generally horrible shape.  I think if more people would support them, it would help them to survive and thrive in spite of all of this.  Give them a shot, and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy them as much as my wife and I have since 2003."}
{"text":"Best catfish around.   Love the snow crab legs too.  Come here every year when in town.  Check out Pro Cyclery across the street to see the best bicycle shop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well, its not a metairie la seafood platter but ok. The fish had freezer burn I ordered the \"Sea Fest\" $14.95 all you can eat. It was obvious that this platter had been frozen & shipped in. But not recently. The waitress was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Hush Puppy was recommended by a friend as the best catfish in town. They did not disappoint. The deliciousness began with the hush puppies, continued with the fried green tomatoes and concluded with the catfish. The whole catfish was flaky and fresh.  Our server, Jean, offered superb service! She was so kind, attentive, and personable.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Food good...servers look like it's a miserable place to work especially the ones who are always there. I finally was served by a wonderful waitress she smiled happy very good service. Just what the place needs. I did not get her name but beautiful personality. Will request her from now on made us feel vip."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! The hospitality was out of this world. Will definitely be back soon. The wait was less than 5 minutes at 7pm on a Friday night, amazing!! The staff was very kind and the waitresses were very attentive and helpful. We tried the frog legs, catfish, alligator bites, crab legs, gumbo and of course the hush puppies! Everything was outstanding. What a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My wife and I totally love going to the hush puppy restaurant.  Been going since 1978. We've had Birthday parties, get togethers with friends and family.  The catfish is out of this world good. The oysters are the best on the planet.  All the sea food I've had is great. We love the salad bar it is perfect.  The sweet potato pie  and pecan pies are awesome.  The atmosphere is homey and warm. Our server Debbie is always attentive and always provides friendly service. Mr John Lopez the Manager is the friendliest man in the world. He makes everyone feel like family.  This is one place everyone should go to. Also each night there is a different  special that is wonderful ."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional!  The food was delicious and the prices were right!  My husband and I usually go to Red Lobster to enjoy seafood but every since we have tried Hush Puppy....Red Lobster is a thing of the past!  The gumbo was the best we ever had!"}
{"text":"We got all the fresh water catfish and shrimp we could eat and it was great.  This is our first time here and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas and spent some time in Louisiana and this place really brings back childhood memories. It features southern cooking which means just about everything is either fried or cooked in bacon fat. The food is really tasty, but this place is NOT for the health conscious. I had the fried alligator and collard greens which were just as goods those I use to get in Louisiana. The salad bar has an ok selection, but they need pickled okra to make the southern feeling complete.   We came in with a fairly large party, about 7 of us in all and our server was fun and efficient. Our glasses were never empty and she made sure we were never wanting for hush puppies with sweetened butter."}
{"text":"I took my family there when they were visiting from California. What drew us in was the cute sign they have for the place on the road. It looks like one of those places you find on a back-water U.S. highway, a little run down and sprawling all over the place, it had style Now I am not a big fan of seafood, so when it came time to order I chose a steak. It was pretty tasty, the sides were good and our waitress was very prompt. What makes my experience only a 3 star one is the thing they called a salad bar.  They had it tucked in this large alcove of a room. The carpet was deeply stained and it had an unclean look about it. From where I was sitting I had to stare at it all night, and there was just something wrong about it.  Food 4 Salad Bar -1"}
{"text":"Alligator was good, but rather non-descript. Frog legs tasted like a very mild white fish, but it eats like chicken."}
{"text":"Always do take out and 30min later the food is still great.  Reminds me of when I lived in Texas.  Fries stay crispy, so few others do.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Read others reviews and decided to give it a try and totally regret it. My food was either over cooked or raw in the center. My husbands food was greasy and too salty.  I don't why on earth there were so many people there!"}
{"text":"We moved here in 1992...and waited this long to try out HushPuppies. Service was excellent and the food was wonderful. The atmosphere was cozy. Take a group of 6 and get a private dinning space. It is worth the drive if you don't live nearby. I know I will return sooner than 20 plus years."}
{"text":"The best Catfish & Crab-Legs on the planet....we've been there many, many times....'cause they just are so damn good....hot & fresh to order - the secret batter must be under lock and key....I would love to know it - - but yes....the Hush Puppy is great."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 20 years......the best -  Catfish, Crab Legs, Steak, Ribs, Oysters, Frog Legs, and Gator-tail."}
{"text":"For the fourth of July I decided to take my mom to have dinner some place different. This is different as in you just don't get this food anywhere. Famous for their catfish which is what I usually get. All you can eat at a decent price. When you arrive it is like a shack down south. Peeling paint on the walls and that homey feeling. What I order every so often is the alligator. Yeah that's right, those reptiles that will eat you in a heartbeat. Deep fried and pretty tasty. The service was outstanding and they have specials Monday through Thursday. Which include all you can eat crab legs to all you can eat ribs. I think it is a place you can just enjoy. Only reason I don't give them a higher rating is the variety of food. I'm one of those variety is a spice of life idiots. Please Please do not forget to try the pickled green tomatoes at the salad bad (included in most meals) I could eat a plate of just that."}
{"text":"Red Lobster is better! The only things good here are snow crab legs and sweet tea. The hush puppies taste like corn dog breading without the hotdog and the all you can eat ribs a chewy and flimsy!  My husband had the all you can eat rib dinner and after the first few bites wouldn't eat anymore and my son had the all you can eat catfish and only ate two bites! They both wound up eating my crab legs!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this. The fried alligator tail with a sort of sweet chili sauce was awesome. The farm raised catfish is very very tasty. This is an eat with your hands. The staff was amazing. I felt like royalty in there!! Gave us some complimentary fried green tomatoes and man those were good too. I'm bummed i didn't try the gumbo. This is a family take on cajun food. Very delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. The hush puppies were out of this world & incredible. The AYCE catfish & shrimp was great, and so was the salad bar. When the manager stopped by our table he answered a question that one of my guests had. Once he found out it was that person's birthday & that we lived 60 mikes away he hand delivered a slice of their homemade pecan and sweet potato pie-both covered with a generous scoop of ice cream, to our table. It was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good.  Fish wasn't hot and baked potatoes dry. This was my first and last time going here for a soul food meal"}
{"text":"This is close to our house, so we go here every so often.  It's NOT BAD.  Not excellent, but NOT BAD.  The salad bar area is a little rickety and like something out of 1985, but then again, the entire place is probably from 1985 and has had no upgrades since then.  So the ambience is very dated.  But who cares.  Food is food.  The food is great.  I always get the shrimp.  Absolutely no complaints.  The macaroni salad from the salad bar is great.  Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a good waitress who is attentive.  Sometimes you get a stupid one who couldn't do her job right even if she only had one guest.  But nevertheless, the food gets to the table hot, it tastes good, and many of the options are all-you-can-eat.  The place is usually busy at peak hours and there have been a few times we can't get a seat.  But when I have called ahead in the past, the receptionist just tells us to \"come on down\" and doesn't take reservations?  Bad policy.  Once we start getting better service consistently, I will probably add a star to the review."}
{"text":"Roomie and i plan to hit one of the restaurant.com spots ( i have 8 coupons left ) - she's up for thai so we make the trek to Mix Zone on Charleston - sad to say they're CLOSED ! We then decide on Rosemary's start driving up Charleston, we see Hush Puppy - she likes the sign, \" can we go there ? \" uhhh, yeah , sure   I've seen the sign several times, but never went in - i didn't even know it's a restaurant !   walk in place is hoppin' - busy and loud ! get a menu, the server there in seconds for drink orders, i ask , how long you guys been here ? 35 YEARS !! oh, ok.   Southern food with an emphasis on frying - cat fish, oysters, shrimp, etc. For $13 get the all you can eat catfish filets and shrimp with fries and a salad bar - a grease fest !!! Roomie gets the cajun plate - blacken catfish, oysters and grilled shrimp - also $13 also comes with salad bar and she opts for the collard greens.   Salad Bar ? big bowl of greens, big bowl of coleslaw, big plate of sliced pickles, then bowls of the lil veggies - loved that they had the pseudo -bacon bits ! This place cracks me up !   my food - very greasy ! i stick with the catfish filets - not too greasy and some of the fillets are decent - nice crunch yet tender on the inside.   the blackened catfish ain't bad.   If you go into this place with the right attitude and expectation - it's worth a try - very reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one that I would think of appearing in Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives. From the outside it's not much of a looker and coming inside not much changes. But wait... there's more!!! Coming here was not my first choice but my friends insisted that the food was really good. They did not steer me wrong at all. They started us off with some hush puppies with butter, amazing. Hot and fresh out of the fire and sweet creamy butter on the side. I had the New York steak with Crab legs and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor they both had packed in them. The crab was so well seasoned and succulent and a large portion. It left me so full that as I moved on to this perfectly charred steak I could barely tackle half of it. I can't forget to mention that we came to the restaurant 10 minutes before closing and the welcomed us with open arms and seated us in a private room. The customer service from every employee was exceptional and whomever runs this establishment should definitely be commended on that. They encouraged us to take our time and enjoy our food and we're so accommodating, making our experience even more enjoyable. The only reason I docked a star is because the salad bar looked wrecked but then again we came near closing and I'm sure it's more neatly arranged throughout the day. I will definitely come back whenever I visit Vegas because I have not stopped thinking about that crab since I got home."}
{"text":"Hush puppy in Las Vegas has been the best food I've had .The cat fish and frog legs are second to none. The people are very nice and friendly especially John Lopez and frances. Love the family atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot with my family. Monday nights were all you can eat crab legs for like $25 and they were delicious! But that's usually all we ever came for.  Since they did away with the AYCA crab legs, I'll usually come here to go through the drive through. I love their fried shrimp, greens, and sweet potato pie!  The other night my boyfriend & I went in to eat & we ended up both getting some catfish & grilled shrimp, I got fried oysters & he got alligator tail. The alligator tail was alright. Kind of bland though. The grilled shrimp was DELICIOUS with just the right amount of spice.   Our waitress was very friendly & sweet, but about halfway through our meal it started getting busy & she was clearly overwhelmed. So It took a while for us to get the bill & then once I gave her my card it took a while more to get the receipts back.   But all in all its a great southern place & the prices are reasonable.   They still have AYCA catfish one night & then a different ACYA another night."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Reminds me of the south. Had Catfish and Shrimp.  The staff was wonderful too! John, the GM made us feel at home and Penny, our server was one of the best and friendliest we've ever had!  Just real good southern food at a great price."}
{"text":"Pros: Been going here with the family ever since I was 5, it's a big childhood memory. They do a pretty damn good job with the catfish, doesn't have that swampy taste. It's pretty much the only good seafood restaurant in Vegas besides Red Lobster, Joe's Crab Shack  and certain buffets.   Cons: Limited take-out menu. Markets itself as a Seafood AND Cajun/Creole restaurant. Does a pretty good job on the first but the latter description leaves a lot more to be desired."}
{"text":"Come on really 3 star?  Have any of you even looked under the glass at your table?  Its a plastic table cover from 1980 that hasn't been cleaned for a decade or so.. Have you looked at the ceiling? It has food on it from the 1980's. The floor hasn't been cleaned since it was installed. Check out the A/C vents they have some interesting features. The girl who seated us provide menu's with tartar sauce all over the inside of them. NASTY!  All the glasses are plastic chipped and cracked. The food is all straight out of a box. My wife was mad at me for taking her to eat here she said are you trying to make me sick?  My bad!  We will not be going back. Save your money go to Long John Silvers.  Did I miss anything?"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE NEEDS ON YOUR BUCKET LIST LAS VEGAS! Meant to review these guys a LONG time ago and dropped the ball. I'm originally from the south. If you're looking for authentic southern comfort food, this is your place. If you don't know what that means, this is where to find out in Las Vegas! The service has always been excellent and be careful with the food, it's so addictive I have to limit my visits in order to bypass a future of 12 step programs. The hush puppies, the catfish, gator tail, EVERYTHING is amazing. If you're afraid of southern food for the reputation, you will not mind the extra gym time."}
{"text":"This place was yummy!  I love the roll they serve along with the butter!  The portions are big and hearty so I would advise that if you want to share, it would be good.  The only thing is the calories but otherwise then that...the food was yummy and would visit again and again if I save all my calories...hahaha"}
{"text":"Was there about an month ago, went back last week. Was good. Salad bar was small but good, no rush. I really do not like fish. But the fish was great here. Would go back. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend. I tried it and loved it. The portion sizes are great. The food was delicious. The salad bar was ok. The hush puppies are the best I've ever tasted. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I drove by other day thinking hey I haven't been in this place forever let's go grub! My friend ordered the position boy.  I ordered the all you eat catfish. Wrong!!!! The salad bar was unkept and the strong smell I'm not sure what it was had me ready to throw in the towel but I'm a team player.  My friends bread was soo hard all the filing feel out of the po boy lol. My baked potato that came with the meal was rotted on the inside. The chef would've knew it if he'd  cut my potato open before it came to the table. I bet you're saying to yourself girl! What! Omg! Hunty let me tell you that's the same thing I said. So after that I kindly spoke my mind about the food that was put out. I was offered a discounted meal but who wants that after the bond of trust was already broken. I don't see how this place is still open."}
{"text":"Live next door to this place and finally tried it tonight. Looking at the menu I didn't think I'd find anything I liked honestly. Not my type of food but whatever I'm up to try anything new.  Place smelled like grandmas house and the noise event are why it's four stars. They had an event with some people who mustve thought they were at a ball game. But that can't be helped when the food booze and energy is flowing. Our waitress was Pam. Very knowledgeable of the menu and when I couldn't decide she made good recommendation of a shrimp and catfish combo. Never tried catfish and the meal was endless. I made it through one plate of food but I liked it. The chow chow was good. The service was excellent. And the food was good. The hush puppies on the table were a nice touch never had them either.  Because of the good service from Pam and good food. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years! A true staple of amazing food in our community!  The waitstaff (especially Pam) goes above and beyond the call of duty! A+++"}
{"text":"Hush puppy has the #1 spot in town for catfish and on wed u can't beat the all you can eat, catfish, ribs and shrimp. And wash it down with some sweet tea."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since I first drove by, and my fiancee finally took me tonight! The food is definitely out of my normal comfort zone, but I was surprised that I really enjoyed it. I had alligator tail for the first time and it was absolutely delicious! My fiancee had the 1/2 rack of ribs, and he loved them. They were so tender, and the BBQ sauce was sweet. The hush puppies stole the show for me, as did the french fries. Both were crispy and cooked to perfection. The amount of food that you get for the price is very good! I was pleased that both meals included a trip to the salad bar. The service was excellent as well. Our waitress, Davida, was so sweet and helpful. What a great, family atmosphere. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Not as good as Texas and Louisiana catfish restaurants. It should be buffet style all you can eat, with pinto beans and lots of onion yum!"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at the Hush Puppy, and it was terrific. I went all out with my friends, so we got to sample everything. The prices are super reasonable, and everything was perfect. Our server, Penny, did a great job of giving us the time we needed to decide things, and the service she provided was prompt, frequent, and super friendly.  The salad and Cole slaw were good (best Cole slaw I have ever had, not embellishing here). I got to try the New York 10oz steak, fried frog legs, fried green tomatoes, fried alligator tail, fried oyster, shrimp, and catfish (both freshwater and farm-raised, farm raised my favorite). Everything was great. I want to particularly say that the shrimp were seasoned with an extra kick, and that the steak was the best I've ever had on a budget-- under $30 and bursting with juicy flavor. The sauces were all on point, and the tartar sauce was sweeter than expected. The fries were good but not special. And of course, the hushpuppies were delicious, especially paired with that sweet butter they make. 10/10, would eat here again. :-)"}
{"text":"Catfish at its best!  First, let me say that my wife is from the back woods of Texas.... she used to literally catch and fry catfish right out of the pond out back growing up.... and she loves that catfish here! We come to Vegas once or twice a year... and we always come to The Hush Puppy at least once during our stay. The all you can eat catfish is the absolute best. Crispy, perfectly seasoned and not too greasy or fishy. I prefer the freshwater, but the farm-raised is excellent too. The hush puppies are fantastic as are the greens!.... and the sweet tea!  Last time we visited, we spoke with John Perez (one of the owners) who introduced himself and gave us some personal attention with a complimentary desert... the homemade sweet potato pie ala mode. Man that was good! Everyone we bring to this place loves it. Excellent food at a very good price. Well worth it!  If you don't like the catfish at this place, then you don't know good catfish. This place is a must every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"All you can eat ribs, shrimp and catfish with salad bar and sweet tea...  Best dinner I have had in months.  This place is amazing.  If you are looking for a taste of the south, look no further."}
{"text":"We came into this established the first time on date night  with StefonieHerrington and Germaine Deschenes. Our server her name was Debbie , they place down hush puppies got our drinks together and kept our glasses filled , now the girls ordered just standard Seafood, myself I tried something different I tried crocodile tail and frog legs for the first time, actually the food was really good they actually bring out some catfish also you will not leave this place hungry or disappointed I would recommend this place to anyone PS there's lots of parking and this place actually is very big inside and very clean"}
{"text":"Went to The Hush Puppy for the first time and the actual owner was the one who took my order. He saw I was first timer so he offered a sample of their signature fish..I thought to myself what great customer service. ...I ordered the fish, ribs, and gumbo. Everything tasted great and they also offer daily specials throughout the week (ex. AYCE ribs)  Definitely going back for seconds and thirds lol!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered all you can eat catfish, frog legs, grilled shrimp, hushpuppies and fried shrimp. Very bland, not enough seasoning. I didn't like any of it. The prices are good.  The only thing that was good was the sweet ice tea and customer service."}
{"text":"What a great find. My boyfriend says they have some of the best Southern style food in town. It's a great family environment and the hospitality is superior. We had the po boy and the catfish, both were excellent. We also had the sweet potato pie for desert and it is a winner! We will definitely be back. Big thanks to John who was amazing."}
{"text":"The young lady at the front rushed us to a table with little acknowledgment aside from the robotic welcome.  The waitress was less than friendly and negative in her explanation of the menu. \"We don't have this. We don't have that. Mother's Day was yesterday.\"  She was also adamant to the next table that they cannot share the all you can eat catfish. They were an elderly couple and the man repeatedly explained that he intended to order two entrees.  She kept poking.  Now let's talk about the food....hush puppies with honey butter----bland, without flavor although hot from the fryer.  The salad bar....pitiful.  I had the Big Bayou Platter (Catfish, Fried Oysters, Clams, Louisiana Shrimp, Alligator Tail) $16.50 ---Overpriced.  All breaded and freshly cooked. The tiny shrimp were ok. The rest was heavily breaded and lacking flavor.  I don't know how they've been around this long. I'm sure many people love this hometown favorite.  As for me, I'll never come here again or tell anyone else to come here....EVER."}
{"text":"This is the spot in Las Vegas. They don't do any form of advertisement yet they've been successful for over 50 years. These yelp reviews are technically their only form of \"advertisement\".   First off they have different specialties ranging on the different days. AYCE BBQ ribs on Wednesday's, and the seafeast on Thursday's are among the more popular ones. My favorite is the seafeast as it come with catfish, fried shrimp, fried oysters, fried clams and the boiled shrimp, and it comes with endless fries too - on top of that there's an open salad bar with potato salad/ macaroni salad/ and others! Hits the spot every time, and if there's room for dessert their pecan pies are one of the best in Vegas.  Run by John, he is the most caring and thoughtful manager I've come across in the restaurant business. He works from Wednesday to Saturday but if you see him he definitely treats every guest like family. Me and my girlfriend go here all the time and even though we go on occasion he remembers us every time.   Be sure to visit one of the best places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Only in Vegas! Thee most delicious catfish, hush puppies, shrimp, and fish, ever.  They have gator, even. I haven't tried that, het, but I have no doubt it's as delicious as the rest of the menu. This place is always packed. The best bet, unless it's date night with the old ball n chain, is to call in your order for pick up. Just make sure you have all your sauces, especially the honey butter."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday and decided to hit this place up... Haven't been here in about 15 years or so.  IT'S STILL GOOD!  Great farm raised catfish with an all u can eat price of $13.99.  That's crazy!  I've eaten at a few places in Southern California and NO way can I get AYCE for $13.99.. That's usually a combo plate with a couple pieces of fish and 2 sides..  The Hush Puppy didn't disappoint my wallet or my palate!  Very good.  The only thing I would suggest is someone tidy up the salad bar.  It was around 930pm and they close at 1030pm, but regardless of time/closing the area should be kept clean.  They have lots of sides at the salad bar to enjoy, but the area was too messy.  Not appealing to me at all.  If the salad bar was up to par, easy 5 stars would have been given!  The service was great.. the hush puppies and honey butter..  Addicting! Can't eat just one!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for some good fried catfish, hush puppies and greens. The gumbo my husband had he said it was delicious.  If your ever in Vegas make sure you stop by and check out hush puppy restaurant."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  I wanted to give it 4 stars being a family establishment and all.  First of all, the food is good.  Really down home good.  One can easily get addicted to the hush puppies with honey butter. Or shall I say honey butter with hush puppies.  It's as though these two need to coexist in flavor.  I tried the hush puppy alone and you just can't indulge without the butter.  Now, if you're expecting a Long John Silver kind of hush puppy, this is not it.  It's more like a yummy corn meal concoction shaped like a cocktail sausage.  This was served hot n fresh while we waited for our order.  One can easily fill up on these before the entrees arrive.  The server was friendly but the place was really busy.   You get one trip to the salad bar and that was fine.   The plates are nicely chilled and there are a few mayonnaise based salads like Mac salad, potato salad, some kind of kraut (?) salad and of course, green salad fixins'.  It was all delicious.  I ordered the award winning gumbo made with turkey.  I didn't see okra in this soup but it had the right amount of flavor and saltiness that I would recommend it.  Different and unique for sure.  Now comes the actual entrée.  We decided to be adventurous and order the platter which included alligator meat, farm raised catfish, fried oysters.    Like the old adage, \"It tastes like chicken\" is true about the 'gator meat.  Yes, even my son will have bragging rights that he ate alligator and actually liked it.  It looked like a chicken nugget.  He also ordered a grilled cheese and really enjoyed it.   I'm not a fan of any farm raised fish, however, the entree came with it.  The catfish was crispy coated in a cornmeal crust and fried just right with no greasy residue, perfect accompanied with tartar sauce. Note: tartar sauce does not arrive with your meal.  You need to pick that up at the salad bar.   So if you have a hankering for fried Bayou type of food, check this place out.  It's not Cajun spicy at all though.  Next time, I will def order the snow crab legs which I heard are flown in from Canada.  This restaurant has some uniquely prepared signature dishes like their hush puppies, alligator meat, catfish and gumbo that would bring me back. It would be nice to have some low cal offerings too, healthier salads or signature desserts.   I get the whole Bayou theme, but this place should get an update and it would up the energy level."}
{"text":"My husband and I happen to be in town for the weekend and we thought we would give this place a try. Not only did we love the southern food, but Johnny and Frannie made our experience very memorable! I told my husband, I felt like I was in the south! The closest thing to southern hospitality you will receive in Las Vegas! We're in the process of buying a new home in Vegas.. We plan to drive into Summerlin and have dinner at least one a month for the food and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"A most attentive and charming waitress at Hush Puppy, or anywhere, is Dawn! She's is just super and always worthy of top tips. Ask for her and you will see for yourself. By the way, the food is super too!!"}
{"text":"What happened to the Hush Puppy? My family started eating here back in 1989 or 1990 right around the time we moved here from Michigan.  We moved out of Las Vegas and returned 8 years later and could not wait to get some catfish from the Hush Puppy. Little did we know that all that made it so great was now gone. The catfish fillets are now cut in half lengthwise so if you order 6 fillets you really only get 3 now, but the price has been raised and we have not been happy at all. Not to mention that we have given them another chance at least 6 more times and not once did we receive hot food. Room temp fish and fries is what we got each time. If I hear they return to full size fillets and hot food maybe we will return but I believe we are done eating at the Hush Puppy because I just don't see them doing that. It's a shame, we used to love it so much. RIP Hush Puppy of ole."}
{"text":"My family moved to Vegas in 1989 and loved the Hush Puppy. We left for 8 years and moved back to find the food quality and quantity has really hit rock bottom. Catfish fillets are now cut in half lengthwise so when you order 6 fillets you really only get three. The prices increased while portions have been cut drastically. If you love room temperature food this is the place for you,  if you like your food hot don't waste your time.  This is not a problem that happened once but each of the last 6 or 7 times we ordered here. Sad to see customers who praised the food at one time no longer enjoy the same service and quality. RIP Hush Puppy, you will be missed."}
{"text":"OK,  I have been visiting this place for a little over a year now quite often.  I will admit I am not a fish eater however they do have a few items for folks like me.  For starters if you pass this place on the street you probably won't want to stop but let me tell you that will be your first mistake.  This place is like they pulled it out of the deep south and brought everything including the building up to Vegas.  Let's start with there special items.  Hush puppies and Fish... I don't eat the fish but have eaten it and they have the best Dang Catfish there is... probably better than you could get say down in Louisianan.  It's all the rave you hear about and see up here on Yelp.  The Hush Puppies or Corn muffins or whatever they are ... Absolutely the best thing you can have (oh they are on the house might I say)  Just like Mom or Grandma making your favorite homemade muffin or bread and giving you a piece right out of the oven... WOW... I want one now...... Ask for the honey butter for those baby's.... OK... now for the good stuff... my meal experience.  I get the New York Steak and Vicki has the Crab legs... First the Crab... Vicki is a connoisseur or aficionado on Crab legs... I never seen such a small thin woman put away so much crab but she can... . she says \" The Crab is probably the very best Crab I have eaten and yes almost as good as  RM Seafood (Rick Moonen's) Place at the Mandalay Bay.... You get the crab in a $20 form of for just $5 bucks more you can have double.  I have tried some of hers and it is OFF THE CHAIN good... Now for the finale...the New York Strip... I get that and a Baked Tater and it comes with a piece of Corn On The Cob... The Hush Puppy's Strip is without a doubt,  the best Steak I have had in all of VEGAS.... Hands Down... No Joke... writing about makes me want one now.... Let me tell you I am a country boy and I grew up eating every kind of steak.  Iv'e also had quite a few here in Vegas. The Hush Puppy's Strip is so flavorful it's rediculous.  Every last bite just melts in your mouth.  If you love steak this is one you absolutly have to try.   I have had one better steak in Vegas and it was at RM Seafood (Rick Moonen's Place)  but let's be fair it was the Felet of Minion Oscar style... and that is not just a steak!  And if you want to Look at my review of RM Seafood it is reviewed under my name.  .. any way... Hush Puppies is my choice for that deep south soulfood that you can only get in Vegas at The Hush Puppie....Oh I almost forgot an all you can eat Down Home Country Cooking Salad bar before the meal that would make Grandma say Hallelujah... ~Vegas Rob"}

{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed at all. Food was phenomenal. The service was grear despite the fact that I was ignored when I walked in. Juan made sure our dinner experience  very was pleasant. Outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"First, this is by no means a \"seafood\" restaurant.  It's not the restaurant's fault that someone put it in that category.  Just the same, if you go to this restaurant looking for fish that come from the sea, you'll be highly disappointed.   This restaurant has Louisiana style food.  I had an alligator/frog leg combo for about $12.95.  The portions were fair, and the alligator was as good as any I had while briefly living in Louisiana.  It came with a basket full of hushpuppies, and they were good.  The salad bar was included, with cole slaw the star of the show there.  My wife had blackened catfish with a baked potato and broccoli.  She's a little weird (maybe not weird, physically fit?) and complains about the butter flavor on the broccoli.  That's a plus in my book.  I tasted some of her dish, and I'd say it was just \"okay\".  She had ample portions, so if you want to be full on a catfish meal for about $12.50, this may be your place.  For the superhungry, they do offer \"all you can eat\" deals."}
{"text":"Yummy. Took my girlfriend here for her first soul food. Soooo good! She got alligator tail. I had ribs. Definitely would come back. They've been here 42 years. John Lopez was very friendly and accommodating! He got us a dessert on the house, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for catfish. I had passed by this place for years from the outside it didn't look like much but the inside is really nice. You will never have to worry about parking they have a huge parking lot. The catfish had nice taste to it breaded and fried just right. The hush puppies were good. The crab legs cooked just right and they're big for snow crab. Our server was attentive and friendly. The price was little on the higher end for this type of food but still reasonable. Overall a good eating experience"}

I looked for Vegan options because I'm a Vegan, there weren't any so I ordered fries and the salad bar which came out close to $15 (wasn't worth it) Also, I don't agree with their payment options: They put it all on one bill. I only brought my credit card"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. My husband and I got the oysters, they were so fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Great catfish!!! Will definitely be back soon. The salad bar was good as well. Many days they have specials so call ahead and ask."}
{"text":"After being in vegas almost 20 years we finally tried hush puppy - wish we tried it 20 years ago!  Food is simple southern comfort with good portions and fair priced and great service - definately coming back.  The hush puppies are addictive with the honey butter but they'll keep refilling them -just ask.  They brought us samples of the gumbo and both types of cat fish - this really helped us to enjoy our meal.  Meals come with trip to salad bar - lots of unusual items to b try like Aligator tail, fried green tomatoes, frog legs, etc..  We also tried the sweet potato pie - very very good and I love swp."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and I think my expectations exceeded their limits because the food wasn't that good to me. While looking over the menu the nice waitress Christy brought out samples so that we could decided between \"farm raised\" & \"fresh water\" fish, now the samples were very good and made decision making easy for us but when the food came we got the total opposites.. I ordered a seafood platter which came wig clam strips, shrimp, oysters, and fish with a side of greens.. The ONLY thing I ate was the greens, I sent back everything except the greens and the fish.. I will not be returning.. The service was good, people were accommodating, but the food wasn't a reflection of the service.."}
{"text":"I have been twice now and both times ordered the 2.5 pounds of crab. It's very good. The hushpuppies and butter are always tasty, and while the salad bar is small it is still more than enough for what it is. Both times we had the same waitress. While I do not remember her name, she was a lovely blonde woman with short hair- not the one with the blonde ponytail, although that waitress was also very nice. However, the hostess that seated us was very rude. We were their third table of the day as we were early, and asked to sit in one of the side rooms seperated from the lower level seating area because my grandmother struggles very hard with stairs and becomes embarassed trying to go up and down them. Her knees are quite bad. When we asked the hostess if we could have one of the rooms-  she made a sound of impatience and loudly smacked the menus against her leg in  irritation. Her expression during the entire bout was one of aggravation, as though our request was making her go out of her way. Our waitress more than made up for it but that hostess just was outright unpleasant. She was short, very petite and a brunette with straight cut bangs and seemed young- not to be confused with the blonde that had a similar hairstyle, she was very nice. We would absolutely go again, I just would not look forward to that particular hostess."}
{"text":"I went yesterday because I was craving catfish. I must say I was disappointed. The hushpuppies where amazing crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries where really good as well. I know I said I was disappointed and I'm getting to that. The catfish was fried perfectly and looked just as great. Too bad it wasn't seasoned. It tastes like they took the fish out of the bag and fried it. They have a few other items on there menu, but I don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Absolutely on-point authentic. And very tasty ... if you're down for it.  DidCha-eatYet? Well welcome South brother cuz we got da fixins! Ohyah.  Those unfamiliar with this type of cuisine & venue might be in for a bit of a shock! This night's special was an AYCE seafood platter.   Datadbe \"fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried oysters, fried clams, French fries, (fried) hush-puppies, super-sweet cole slaw and salad bar. Fifty-cent extra for collard greens. Your iced tea and gooey-when-hot pecan pie not included.   Btw, better order \"UN-sweet tea.\" Say the UN real loud now ya'll. Because, in the South, a tall glass of sweet tea generally contains a five-pound bag of sugar.  The key cuisine-concept here, obviously, is ... fried. Old-school deep South = a lotta deep fried greasy-goodness grub fo da poor workin' man.  Having spent a good bit of my years in the coastal South, I've likely downed thousands of hush-puppies in at least fifty places on this line of cuisine. Some of those joints were utterly fantastic, more than a few utterly nasty-greasy. So I have a rock-solid baseline from which to compare.  To me, this place is very, very authentic in almost every aspect.   This venue is not \"presenting a concept.\" These people know the real deal - cuz they good people from Texarkana - and they've replicated it in full, right here on West Charleston.  The décor, while quite well-kept, is pretty much on-the-mark with many a typical Deep South venue of this ilk: distressed wood-plank Hooters-style crab shack interior, with a good bit of Cracker Barrel motif slung about the walls & shelves. All that was missing was a heavy dose of insert-your-local-favorite-SEC-football-team-here flags & bric-brac. Thick oval bake-ware plastic plates in all of the available high-school cafeteria pastel colors. Fetch yo chilled salad plate outo' a cooler - that was probably used 40 years ago at an Arkansas gas station to chill Coca-Colas in tall glass bottles. Ice cold! Even the tiny upcharge for collard greens exactly replicates what many such Southern venues extract.   All of this absolutely on-point authentic, but if you are looking for swank, you need to take yo @ss on uptown, ya-hear?  (Full disclosure: In the South, this type of restaurant can actually surface anywhere, in any kind of low-rent venue, in any part of town and with minimal decor & fixtures. I mean the walls may be dirty for lack of paint! The absolutely best I ever had ... and it WAS excellent ... and the cheapest ... was a sorta-broken-chairs-n-tables joint smack-dab in the middle of 'the poor-side of town.')  The background music, at acceptable-volume, was Sunny 106.5 Vegas, heavy on 80s up-tempo pop.  While I was in this space I actually forgot for a while I was even IN Vegas. You probably will too.  On to the grub.   The salad bar was very satisfying. True to these venues, salad fixins were minimal: black olives, tomatoes, cheese, croutons, cukes and such. Dressing in squeeze bottles. I didn't see any lil gray raw oysters, a usual offering. But I'm good with that.  The hush-puppies (hot little crispy-fried balls/footballs of highly-sweetened cornmeal) were very soft, very lightly fried. Much better than average; some places just fry them up hard-as-a-freakin-marble. Best eaten dipped in butter.  When it comes to the fried seafood, the target is \"battered but not too much batter, tasty-greasy-goodness but not nasty-greasy.\" Most of this was also on-point, but the oysters were a bit too small, and a bit too battered & oily. No surprise, I suppose, since oysters are the highest-ticket material here. But I am ALL about fried oysters, so this was a bit of a letdown.  Collard greens. The true test is \"earthy.\" Collards tend to absorb a lot of flavor and nutrients from the ground. Look it up - they are durn good for you! Collards should almost taste like they have a bit of dirt in them. I find them best with salt and malt vinegar. These were well above average, quite the trick given there's no solid Southern topsoil anywhere near.  THE AYCE came in at $19.45, base. But you can order regular single-serve platters with AYCE salad bar here in the $12 range.  CONCLUSIONS: If you've never tried these sorts of eats, give it a whirl. And then you can scratch it off your bucket list. One visit and you'll know if you're down for more of it ... or if it's not to-your-likin.   As for me, Daddy-likes!"}
{"text":"My first time there was with my family about a year ago. I hear raves about this place but was a bit skeptical b/c of where it was located....a small little hut no bigger than a Fast food joint. But don't let looks fool you. Monday nights is the AYCE Crab Legs....to die for.  We arrived there around 6:30p and that place was jam-packed. There was no where to sit inside, people were waiting outside, but since it was in the middle of winter, we all stuffed our bodies inside and it was so hard to get around. But you weren't cold that's for sure.   The hostess was a bit rude, but all the other staff were really nice and helpful. How can a restaurant put a hostess up front to greet people with \"how many? well...you're going to have to have a seat and wait because we have no tables.\" and not..\"Hi, good evening, how many are in your party? Can i have your name? We will call you when there is a table ready?\" --seriously its not so hard. i wanted to slap that hostess. But on a brighter note....we were finally seated and ready to eat.  I didn't know you got Hush puppies with your crab...for no extra charge...niice. And there is a AYCE Salad bar as well to compliment the crab. A nice deal for $25 a person i must say."}
{"text":"For a place called \"The Hush Puppy\", you'd think their hush puppies would be better.  Their hush puppies are really just small pieces of very plain fried cornbread & are NOT real hush puppies.  With enough honey butter, they're pretty tasty though.    I went here looking for some catfish (I'm a Southern girl) and was surprised to see that they serve bone-in catfish and not just fillets!  The catfish is ok...nothing special.  They're kind of small and don't have as much flavor as I'd like, but I guess I really shouldn't complain about the catfish in the desert lol.  We went on a week night & the place was pretty much dead, so there was definitely not a problem with waiting for a table.  Even though there were only a hand-full of diners, the service was pretty weak.  We got the all you can eat deal and had to wait a bit for food and drink refills - they only bring out 2 pieces of (small) fish at a time, so that was a little annoying.  I'll definitely go back when I'm craving some bone-in catfish, but I know not to set my standards too high."}
{"text":"Homey atmosphere and the best Catfish I have ever had anywhere in Nevada!  Do not eat anything before you go and watch out for the Hushpuppies they are very filling."}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple years back with family during a trip to Vegas and loved it! Ordered all-you-can eat. My dad even got sick for over-eating! We couldn't wait to visit again this time.  We ordered alligator tail as appetizers this time and they were yummy. However, the all you can eat platters we normally order was good only towards the END. It seemed as if the oil used to fry our fish and shrimp initially was old...yuck! I don't even want to know how old. At the end of our meal (as they brought our new batches) it seemed to taste better. I like to enjoy my food in the beginning. I inquired with our waitress about the oil used and she confirmed that she did see one of the chefs change the oil to fresh oil at the end. Whack! The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though.   Our service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.  Note: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :("}
{"text":"We had a dinner here with a group of people not knowing anything about it since we are not from the area. When we walked in, it reminded me of an older Red Lobster wanna be with lots of rooms. The waitress was not terribly friendly. She was going through the motions. I wonder if she was overwhelmed by the size of the group.   On my end of the table, most of us had the all you can eat seafood platter. It consisted of fried shrimps, clams, fish and oysters and French fries. The French fries were cold and everything else was lukewarm. It had an feel of glorified fast food. My husband was sick (kept having to go to the bathroom) all night.   I know many rave about this place but we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Wow...this place will sure make your puppy go..goo goo ga ga  Love the food....all u can eat salad bar, great quality & quantity juicy snow crab, scrumptious fried oyster, and flavorful ribs with meat fallin' off the bone.  The menu changes daily like all you can eat crab on monday etc.  Your belly will sure be satisfied and stuffed....just plain yum.    If you're feelin' adventurous...try alligator or frog.  Maybe on my next trip.  The decor is southern meet bamboo country style.  Your server is very friendly.  Did I also mention...very reasonable pricing.  Whenever you're bored.....of course you're in Vegas so hit the slots inside the restaurant.  I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Horrible, we (party of 3) arrived at 915 in a Thursday night. As we walked through the front door I realized they were scheduled to close at 10.   Me and my stepson stood at the front counter while the waitress/hostess looked right at us 3 times, said nothing and walked away. 30 seconds later she finally seated all 3 of us.  We ordered the food, and it arrived. My chicken was undercooked my wife and stepson food was unseasoned, the French fries were cold on both our plates.   My wife was visibly upset and expressed her opinion of our experience to waitress. We paid, left and we will not be returning.   It's possible that we went on a bad night or too close to closing. Either way we won't be wasting the gas or time at this place ever again."}
{"text":"First off, I do not work for the company. Secondly, I have only been there once. My husband & I went here with friends who winter in Vegas, on our recent visit there. Yes, it's \"divey\" and could use some updating. The salad bar was fresh, and I can tell salad that isn't. Very good macaroni salad. Husband and I had the all you could eat catfish and it was phenomenal. It had a real cornmeal coating, not some stupid \"batter\". It was moist and tender and quite flavorful. I mostly like the fact they were boneless fillets; around here all you get is a slab of half a fish you have to pick off the bones. Tartar sauce seems to  be homemade. Service was prompt and friendly...a server who has worked there for years and knows our friends. I had the collard greens as my side (felt I'd been eating far too many freid foods and carbs on our trip) and they were amazing. And I know collard greens from my best friend. Lastly, it was a Saturday night and they were very busy when we left...the place was full of people who seemed to know what good southern-fried fish and the extras ARE. Try the jalapeno hush puppies if you think the originals are too bland. Price was fantastic...less than $60 for four adults. Where can you say THAT in Vegas?"}
{"text":"CHANGED the FISH!!! Why did I just leave unsatisfied?? They changed the freshwater fish and it IS NOT thin & mild anymore it is like a thick catfish strip and the batter was off. I confirmed with our server this was the 1st day of \"new fish\"...wow all the way from Cali and my dinner was horrible. I mean they already changed to the \"batter/seasoned\" fries...really they should offer plain fries but OK fine.   Why oh why would they change their staple product CATFISH??  After 20 years, I am not happy to say the least, especially when I have been eating grilled fish and decided to venture off this is what I get...DAMN, DAMN, DAMN!!!!! (in my Florida Evans voice)"}
{"text":"I actually come here often. I really like the fresh caught catfish. Cole slaw is pretty good and hush puppies are great with their honey butter (extra cost). Sides are - meh. Fish well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great service, food was on point, catfish bites were juicy, fried shrimp was delicious. They have a nice salad bar that come with most meals. The manager John came over and discovered it was our first time here and offered us a complimentary pecan pie dessert. Experience was perfect for a date night. Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years, and enjoyed it each time.  The AYCE catfish and shrimp is my favorite meal.  My wife isn't a fan of catfish, but she says Hush Puppy has the best steak in all of Las Vegas (and she's tried a bunch).  All meals come with salad bar, which isn't spectacular, but it is a nice touch over traditional side salads.  And, of course, you can't forget about the free hush puppies that they put on the table... it's easy to spoil your appetite gorging on those!"}
{"text":"All you can eat southern fried farm raised catfish...that's all you need to know.  Been eating at this restaurant for 25+ years and their food has not changed. Great food and good service.  I come back every year since moving and it is still tasty as ever..."}
{"text":"This place is sooo gud. Everytime I visit Vegas I always go here. Great food all around. Fish is excellent and the hush puppies will knocked your shoes off. That's how good they are. Take your friends and enjoy it"}
{"text":"Always good food, but ordering through the drive thru is it really too much to have butter and pickled tomatoes included in the family packs?!!! Like come on!!! Ordering all that fish and hush puppies you DO  NEED BUTTER DUHH!!"}
{"text":"i would have loved to give more stars but i am not completely convinced. the oysters are tasty but small. i love the fried green tomatoes. my husband usually gets the fish and says its okay."}
{"text":"Came here in a recommendation and glad I did. First thing the waitress offered was a sample of the catfish. She brought full size pieces of both freshwater and farm raised. Freshwater definitely better! The all you can eat is a great deal with hushpuppies, salad bar, fish and a side. Tasty. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best crab legs!!! And hush puppies.. But I do love the fried shrimp- try the fried green tomatoes! The old charm of this place! It's my stomping grounds. I love Hush Puppy!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple in the Las Vegas Valley this is still one one the best places for seafood . It old but good . The Hush puppies corn bread & butter are good  the fish and all other sea food is good. For those that don't do seafood, chicken ribs steaks are on the menu.. have fun be full..."}
{"text":"First time at Hush Puppy and I have lived here all my life. John was so nice and welcoming. I love their catfish plate and their ribs are also delicious. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time- like 5 years since I visited Hush Puppies and I could recall if I liked the food. So when I moved back to Las Vegas and wanted some fish I drove thru and ordered the catfish sandwich. I had to wait 15 for my order and the food was cold the fish was so think all I tasted was the bread it was in between. Very disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"Catfish is as good as it gets here for the price, 3piece with fries and 4 hushpupps is $7 or 5piece for $10. Gumbo is delicious, could have a little more flavor but more than edible. Hush Puppies are always cooked to perfection the few times I've been there and I'm not the biggest fan of hush puppies in general. Still have to try the greens, but I'll pass on the sweet potato pie! Will definitely be back consistenly as its less than a mile from the house and the pricing can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Normally I like the food. Had the baby back ribs. Became very ill. Stomach issues, chills, dry heaving. Might stay away for a while."}
{"text":"Wasn't real impressed. The place was very outdated and reminded me of a place I may have gone to as a child but as an adult I now know there are better choices for food out there. The salad bar was very tiny and the pasta salad that I tried had way too much Italian dressing dumped on it. The lettuce for my salad was very fresh and crisp and tasted very good just wish there were more options of what to put on it. Half the containers for dressing weren't label on the bar. My guess is that half of them were ranch and the other half Italian. Would have been nice to have known for sure though. The hush puppies were good but definitely not good enough to warrant another trip back here. I ordered the frog legs and Alligator tails combination plate and had corn with it. I was very excited to try something new. I've never had frog legs or Alligator before but it was disappointing. The frog legs tasted like skimpy chicken legs that weren't as tender as chicken. The ratio of batter to frog legs was not a good mixture. Too much batter that was. Would have preferred to either have bigger legs or less batter. The Alligator tail was nothing special. No real flavor. I won't be coming back for either of those. I ordered a glass of wine and it was a very small glass filled to the top of very cheap tasting wine. Fortunately it was only $4 so yeah maybe it just was cheap wine. I was tempted to order some oysters for an appetizer but for almost $2/oyster I could do without. Considering I can get them cheaper at a fancier restaurant than this one. All and all I wasn't impressed and don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago, not knowing what to expect considering the part of town this place is in;) And what a pleasant surprise! Friendly hostess, sat us quickly, informed us of the specials going on right on cue. And for 31 dollars and change (not counting the tip, and including the ten percent military discount), he had 2 happy hour beers, I had sweet tea, and we ordered fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, and for the main meal we had the alligator tail and catfish platters. They came with the minimal salad bar, as well as a side. Everything was great and the sweet tea was the best I've found in Vegas so far:) Definitely want to go back:)"}
{"text":"Beyond sad edging into embarrassing.   Might as well take your money dip it in lard and set it on fire.   The food is gross, no flavor, greasy without being good and the place is grimy. Normally I try to give a place a couple of chances but here I'm making an exception once was more than enough.  I used to live in Birmingham, AL and this is the saddest representation of southern cooking ever."}
{"text":"GUMBO AND FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, Y'ALL!  That's all you need to know about this place; come here for those items specifically!  What so many other reviews don't mention is that this place HAS A DRIVE THRU. That's right- you don't need to go in with a group or plan a family dinner around their evening-only hours, just drive up and get what you want and go! Dishes are made fresh, so expect a reasonable 8-10 minute wait time in the comfort of your vehicle.  On first visit, I ordered #4 (3 piece \"snackbox\" of fried catfish plus hush puppies and fries), a side of gumbo ($5 for a small portion), and the fried green tomatoes appetizer ($3 for 6 slices, seasonal availability). Total meal was about $15, not bad for what would ultimately be 2 meals for me.  Was pleasantly surprised by quality- fish was freshly fried, batter didn't fall off, wasn't too greasy and oil didn't taste old. Fries were a bit on the soggy side but had good flavor, seemed to have a touch of batter to them. Hush puppies were weird, didn't eat them- strange oblong shape and no flavor. Disappointed that the 3 piece order was served with only one tiny cup of tartar sauce- it was tasty,  wished there was more. Portion for price (meal is about $6) was good, didn't come close to finishing.  Now for the real surprises- the GUMBO and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES. The gumbo was a small portion for the price but packed with sausage and crawfish. Flavor was on par with Weeziana's, just up the street, but her pricing for portion is  better ($10 gets you a tureen!). Fried green tomatoes were delish- batter was different from what the fish is breaded in and more mild, and they're served with a delightful dipping sauce. Will continue come back just for these two dishes!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for a quick dinner. The food is SO delicious, and since I live right around the comer and there is a drive through it is so convenient."}
{"text":"A friend picked this place.  I'm not a seafood person but it was a group event and I was sure they'd have other fare. The place seemed Sizzler-esq with its  small salad bar and old decor. The pickles were the highlight of the salad bar but I am sure they were Velasic's. My corona was nice and cold so a star for that.  Let's talk about the food.  It tasted like frozen food deep fried in questionable grease. The actual hush puppies that they provide for the table with the sweet butter are good though, star for that. Now what really was the draw was the free entertainment. Our waitress was a 40ish tweaker. Very hyper,  forgetful and loquacious. She noticed we were a table of lesbians and decided to share a story about her gay daughter using her gay guy friend's sperm and a turkey bastard to father her granddaughter. If you could have seen my face. She went on to tell us the little girl's name was Quenzel after a Disney princess. I couldn't wait to leave. It was the strangest thing ever!! Needless to say I won't be back.  ( Also there is a strange smell when you are near the slot machine area that lingers in the lobby.... ummmmm  gross.)"}
{"text":"I eat fish once or twice a week and since I wasn't in the mood to cook my usually: fish, collard greens, hush puppies, and homemade potato salad. I came on yelp to review soul food restaurants. Well since I hate driving and I wasn't trying to drive that far- I find this place.  I order a catfish sandwich to-go and it came with seasoned fries .  OMG when I got home- I noticed that it was to much food.  I was only able to eat half the sandwich and some of the fries. The sandwich came on a toasted hamburger bun with lettuce, and onions, and two nice size seasoned pieces of fish. Not sure if they didn't have tomatoes or what but I added my own. I added some hot sauce and i was good to go. It was good hands down. I will be returning next week:)."}
{"text":"Great,great food. Awesome customer service...I'm from LA and i wil be back very soon. Thanks again."}
{"text":"At first I  had my druthers, because my boyfriend and I had gotten there at 8:30-8:40pm, and they don't close till 10:00pm, and the doors were locked! I called to see if they were still opened,  and this very rude employee named Lorain answered the phone, and then she  had the nerve to put me on hold! After I had decided to hang up, and call back, to give Ms.Thing Lorain an education in customer service,  I was greeted by the kindest voice, that told me that since it was just the  two of us, that she would unlock the door, and wait on me, and my boyfriend herself. Well, that was Ms. Quinn, the manager,  and we got beyond great service,  and delicious food, and guess what Lorain? You missed out on a great tip. My suggestion,  tell Lorain to find another,  one that doesn't deal with customer service, because she doesn't know how to act like a professional,  and give Ms. Quinn a raise!"}
{"text":"Hush Puppy you have failed me. I was really disappointed my most recent visit here, especially since I really enjoyed my experience the last time I was in. I came here with my family for my birthday dinner because they have the crab leg special. Crab legs are one of my favorite foods, and I always try to get them every year on my birthday. Hush Puppy has 2.5lbs of snow crab legs every day for $26.99. This includes a side and a trip to the Sysco salad bar, as I like to call it.  First things first, they shoved our party of 7 in a small ass room, on the closed side of the dining room. There was plenty of other seating on the other side of the OPEN restaurant, so I am not sure why they did that. This was annoying for two reasons. The first being that because there was not much room to maneuver, it was hard for everyone to get in/out to go to the salad bar.  And the second is because this resulted in us being pretty much ignored throughout the whole meal. I mean how would you even remember we were there? Our server never came by to clear off salad plates, or offer refills on drinks. When our food came out, some older guy not wearing a uniform dropped our food off to us. The crab legs that I was so looking forward to, came out lukewarm and they didn't taste fresh which was a big let down. Other people in my group ordered the AYCE fish platter that comes with fried shrimp, oysters, clams and cat fish. Their food was a hit or miss. Somethings came out cold and others fresh out of the fryer. I enjoyed the fried shrimp and the oysters, the few pieces that I did get to try. 7 out of 7 people agreed that we would not be back."}
{"text":"Okay, disclaimer to start, I am NOT a seafood fan, but the rest of my family is. So, Mom and wifey wanted Hush Puppy for Mother's Day. So, that's where we went. They all got seafood and said it was very good. I ended up getting the BBQ ribs and they were good. Not the best in the world, but definitely not the worst! Portion sizes are generous and the all-you-can eat deals will leaving you feeling like you are going to bust! The salad bar is small and, in my opinion, lacking. Also, in all the times we have visited, they have never been able to keep it stocked and customers are always asking for an employee to stock it. Overall, not a bad place, especially if you like seafood."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in forever. The last time I was here was I think 2003. With my grandparents and mom. Food was pretty good for what I remember."}
{"text":"Awesome dine inn experience, Pamela was awesome the manager is great walked around and checked on us all night . Pamela was super friendly with out kids and I will be back for more!!! Had all you can eat cat fish and shrimp with crab legs awesome all you can eat kids menu for the shrimp so cool!!"}
{"text":"fried fish in a creative place.  If you are a new local, check this place out.  Some fun outside of the strip!  yeah!!"}
{"text":"The hush puppy was alright. The fried prawns maybe frozen prawns, and the Oysters were room temperature with no flavor at all. The salad bar was regular lettuce and I always like spring mix salad. The ribs were good my, and the hush puppies were good, other than that....I am cool, but still try if you are in Las Vegas and draw your own conclusion."}
{"text":"Growing up in Florida, I'm used to having the freshest seafood available. This place definitely delivered. The sweet tea was very good!! The gator was awesome! I really loved the sauce that came with(sweet:spicy) The catfish was well cooked and delicious, as was the shrimp and the fresh hush puppies. Most important was our service from our server Penny. She was the sweetest woman ever. She was so downhome and had us feeling the country comfort:) Reminded me of back east. All in all, a fantastic place to spend your meal! Only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because of the girl upfront as hostess. She was very rude like it was annoying her to have to seat us. I wish I would have got her name.."}
{"text":"Good place if you're looking for good fresh catfish hush puppies are amazing they melt in your mouth definitely try this place is a little far for me because I don't live that close to the area but it was well worth the drive"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday and I did my homework and Yelped this place ahead of time. The reviews were pretty good so I was ready to try it out. It was good but I didn't find myself doing my happy booty wiggle in my seat when I took my first bite. The ribs were pretty tasty, I enjoyed the rub they used, and it was the first time I had tried a fried green tomato and it was delish. The collard greens were decent in flavor and in texture, the corn cob tasted like it was boiled too long and had that mushy texture to it. I feel corn cob is best served slightly steamed, I felt more people at my table would have eaten and not wasted it if it were, just a suggestion.  I tried the fried butterflied jumbo shrimp, it was fried shrimp, nothing more than that. The crispy fries that accompanied the shrimp were  really crispy and good.  The potato salad from the salad bar I did enjoy. I have to admit that I wasn't expecting to eat off of plastic plates, I generally prefer glass plates, but that's just my preference.   The service I thought was great very attentive and polite waitress, I wish I had gotten her name. Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to come back when I am in town visiting,  but I can see why the locals enjoy it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fish at the hush puppy and the service was great but not so sure I would recommend dining in. I would give the drive thru four or five stars. You can get an amazing home cooked meal in the drive thru for $5-10. If you eat inside it's like $15-25 for the same food except you get a salad bar and it's not much to rave about. So in other words just hit the drive thru."}
{"text":"ALMOST HALF AS GOOD AS RED LOBSTER Each year I'm elated to see that my very favorite restaurant, Red Lobster, is voted \"Number 1 Seafood Restaurant\" in the Las Vegas Weekly Best of Las Vegas poll. So when I done found out that there was a place that locals thought was better'n Red Lobster, I just had to check it out.  For starters, we got what looked like mini-corn dogs without the stick. I was disappointed to find there was no finely ground meat-in-a-tube inside but just corn meal. That's when I realized that we never ordered mini-corn dogs but that these were the restaurant's namesake HUSH PUPPIES. Um, well, I suppose these are corn dogs, er, hush puppies because they are two-bite corn meal nuggets, but they sure don't seem like the hush puppies that I'm used to. Hell, Long John Silvers has traditional hush puppies that are more like the real deal. These look like a yellow robot rabbit vacated it's bowels into a red plastic, wax paper lined basket. But hell, I'll eat fried bull testicles (aka Rocky Mountain Oysters) so why not eat yellow robot rabbit turds? With the honey butter that they supply, they actually have a subtle pleasant taste to them, if you're looking for something sweet and fried that is.  The reason we went to the Hush Puppy is that it was billed as a Louisiana style restaurant. Visions of Cajun and Creole danced in our heads on our way over (which made driving quite a chore... no more White Widow Kush before operating light-heavy machinery). When we got there we were pleasantly surprised that it was Cajun without the Creole, or more like Creole without the Cajun.   The FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were actually quite good and were on special at $2.95. They are regularly $4.95 which would have been a rip off, but for $2.95 it was okay. And they do have GUMBO as an appetizer for $6.95. It comes in a bowl and you can add ALL YOU CAN EAT SALAD BAR for $2.95 which makes it a meal.  Well, let's talk about the Salad Bar. It was sad. I would say that it was basic, but it didn't even have Broccoli or Cauliflower. In other Yelp reviews I read that people were happy that it was clean and there wasn't tomatoes in the dressing and such. Yeah, I'd be happy about that, too, but that doesn't UP the star rating, it just keeps it from going down. The selections on the Salad Bar were extremely limited. (There was an area that could have held 6 more pots of dressing or ingredients that was basically just ice covered by whole leaves of a leafy lettuce which was just a space filler. They have the room, they don't have the desire to put more out.) The one saving grace on the salad bar was the COLE SLAW. It's slightly more coarse than KFC cole slaw and a little less sweet, which makes it perfect in my book. Cole Slaw is one of those dishes that people regularly disagree on. It seems to depend on how you had it when you grew up, and the cole slaw here is just the way I like it. But the rest of the salad bar is sub-par.  But if this is a Louisiana or Cajun or Creole place, what was seriously LACKING was anything like JAMBALAYA or ETOUFFEE. Yes, they have ALLIGATOR TAIL and FROG LEGS, but where's the classic dishes? Why not offer them?  My girlfriend ordered the BLACKENED CATFISH with BAKED POTATO and CORN ON THE COB. The Blackened Catfish was actually very good. The blackening tasted very good (although I like extra blackening and can always use a little more.) A little sprinkle of salt really brought out the flavor and it is a dish that I would recommend. The baked potato was overdone, indicative of mass cooking them and keeping them in a warmer too long. The worst part of her meal was the ICE COLD CORN ON THE COB. Blech. One bite and it was \"NO THANKS!\" That's a serious lack of attention to detail on the kitchen staff. (I don't expect the waitress to notice the temperature of something like that.)  If you are looking for large quantities of FRIED SEAFOOD at a very reasonable price, there are a lot of options. ALL YOU CAN EAT FRIED CATFISH (Fillets or Fiddlers, which are small whole catfish) and ALL YOU CAN EAT SHRIMP, or a combination of two of the above for $12.50. Most people are done with AYCE Fried Food once they're out of high school (or maybe college for some), but if that's your thing, then it sounds like it's quite a deal here. They do have AYCE CRAB LEGS on Monday night (for something like $24) but my experience wasn't good enough to merit a return trip so I won't be finding out what a deal it is.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't eat here and I understand how places like these can grab a loyal local patronage. For me, there are way too many much better places to eat that I can't imagine coming back on my own volition. By the way, pulling out of the parking lot we had already come to our verdict, but by the time we got home, my girlfriend had a very upset stomach that lasted through the night. I'm sure it was just luck of the draw but it ended up being the final straw.  Kitty Got Si"}
{"text":"Homestyle food w/homestyle decor and great servers. Penny is awesome and everyone should ask for her.  You can tell that they have a loyal base of locals and vacationing patrons coming to eat there cause it always packed. And the food is filling and can easily be shared by two people. Sweet potato pie is A MUST"}
{"text":"All you can eat shrimp + hush puppies= ok i came here for seafood,i got water and Dr Pepper, we got hush puppies we went to the salad bar. I got all you can eat shrimp, and that was great I liked this place."}
{"text":"My husband is native North Carolinian and we've lived there for several decades before coming to Vegas for good. So we're always on the lookout for good southern cooking...and Cracker Barrel is not it!Tonight was our first time at The Hush Puppy. Great service, very good food. More on that.   The hush puppies are the best we've had since 42nd Street Oyster Bar in Raleigh. The honey butter was perfect. Not too much honey but just enough. Light, crisp, lovely.  We had the fried green tomato appetizer to start. Our only complaint was they don't jazz it up with Tabasco before frying like my husband prepares his but they do provide hot sauce on the table. Then my husband got the Bayou Platter with shrimp, alligator, catfish and oysters. I got the #4 senior plate. Both included a trip to the salad bar.  I don't normally rave about salad bars but I will this one. The mixed greens were beyond fresh. The pickled tomatillos (I believe that's what they were) were to die for as was their fresh-every-day-at-4:00 cole slaw. You could tell the dressings were made fresh in-house, not out of a bottle. They were delicious and very cold as was the tartar sauce. Having had food poisoning from warm tartar sauce back in NC, I am very leery of it and learned how to make it at home. Normally I will not eat it out. I had no qualms about eating this because it tasted very fresh and it was chilled right there at the salad bar.  However, we can't rave about the alligator or oysters. They weren't that good. The alligator was extremely rubbery and chewy. But who knows, maybe that's just alligator. My husband has never failed to eat all his fried oysters, he loves them, but he left one tonight.   The catfish, however, was excellent. One other review complained about the excessive usage of salt on the catfish but we couldn't detect any at all. Maybe we got someone else's no-salt order. We had to add some. My butterflied shrimp on the senior plate were very good. I don't believe they were the frozen ones you get in other restaurants. These tasted like they were hand breaded just before frying.  Best of the best, though, was the southern iced tea. This was not made from powder. It's good old southern sweet tea like your mama once made that has been boiled and the sugar added to melt while it is still hot. If you don't like \"turn your teeth inside out sweet\" order it half with unsweetened. They are glad to accommodate.  All in all, a very good meal and we will be back when we get a hankering for good old down home cooking."}
{"text":"Could this have been the worst food I have ever eaten in a restaurant? If not, it was among the worst of the worst. Stinky smelly catfish is not what you expect to eat at a restaurant where the parking lot is jam packed every night. I don't get it!! Out of our table of five only one person had an acceptable meal. I had the combo meal with fried Catfish and fried shrimp. Shrimp were acceptable, but the Catfish - terrible! And it wasen't just me. Four out of five of us did NOT like our meals. My brother had the grilled Catfish and it was fine. The rest of us had the fried and it was horrible. I would rather lick someones feet that has been hiking for 100 miles than eat at this restaurant again. The couple at the table next to us left half their meals and boogied out of there also. And, what's with the things they call Hush Puppies? They are just fried corn bread. Man oh man, Long John Silvers has better (not great) Hush Puppies!  NEVER AGAIN FOLKS!!! I don't know what these farm raised Catfish are being feed. The only thing I can think of is that they are fed effluent from a sewage plant that is nearby. If you must try this restaurant bring a nose clamp and drink a carafe of wine before you eat. Otherwise scratch this off of your list of must go to restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hands-down the best catfish you will ever have! The side dishes are amazing, you must try the chow chow it's to die for! The owner himself comes around and says hi to you and last but not least don't forget to have the hot sweet potato pie with ice cream and whip cream. Their way to give this place more stars?"}
{"text":"Awesome service fast service , good food , best pecan pie you can get in Las Vegas , but portions are very small."}
{"text":"OmfGEES the food is to die for!!! Best catfish and fried green tomatoes I've ever had in my entire life!!! Will DEF BE BACK!!! Again and again  bravo!"}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriends absolute favorite places to eat. He loves seafood, and so do I. I will say I love more traditional non-southern seafood so I only like a few menu items here. Fried oysters are good, the hush puppies are good obviously. He, on the other hand, will eat anything they give him. He loves the poboys especially. Overall, a great place. We keep coming back."}
{"text":"Not the best food in the world but I still love this place! Good for when you crave fried food. Been going here since I was a kid. Love the decorations, hush puppies, salad bar, pickled tomatoes, catfish with hot sauce and a pitcher of Abita ! Oh goddamn, son!"}
{"text":"Almost 2 weeks ago, we ate at Hush Puppy and have been craving it ever since.   We went on a Wednesday night at 830pm. We were seated immediately. There was probably 3 other tables and 1 waitress.   For appetizers, we ordered a cup of seafood gumbo, fried oysters, and clam strips. The hush puppies were incredible. We had to refrain from eating too many of those. They were too addicting.   For entrees we ordered the seafood platter with fries and 2.5lbs of snow crab platter with collard greens. Both of the entrees came with the salad bar. The salad bar was simple and we loved it.   EVERYTHING we had was tasty and fabulous. My favorite was seafood gumbo and snow crab platter.   I promised a plate for a friend of mine but I was not sure what to get. By suggestion from the waitress, I ordered the catfish/shrimp combo dinner and a slice of pecan pie to go. Great choice! My friend enjoyed his meal as well.   We can't wait until our next visit for a catfish fix."}
{"text":"Penny is amazing!!! Such a sweet, caring person!!! Everyone here is really nice, great customer service but I'd have to say Penny is the best host I've ever encountered!!!"}
{"text":"We just returned from our first visit to The Hush Puppy and had a wonderful time. The people -- especially our waitress, Penny -- were very friendly, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was wonderful. We're not sure why we waited so long to have dinner at The Hush Puppy (together we have been in Las Vegas for a combined total of more than 100 years), but we can guarantee you that we'll be back over and over again.  Together with our best friends, we had an absolute blast and will return again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered and paid extra for the thick catfish they gave me the thin. Still good just annoying as im not driving 20 mins back"}
{"text":"This down-home Southern spot is a great place to FILL UP at a great price. Their menu has unlimited fish options and most of their entrees come with a visit to the salad bar, which will fill you up before you even get your entree! There are plenty of options for everyone to choose from and be satisfied.   The salad bar has a pretty basic selection of salad ingredients. The standouts there are the pickles, if you're into that (which I am), and their homemade dressings.   Their menu is divided into different sections. They have an all-you-can-eat catfish section that comes with fries if you really want to grub. I myself wasn't up for the challenge, so I got a House Specialty: the Cajun Fantasy w/ blackened catfish, shrimp, and fried alligator tail (with options to have tilapia as the main fish and fried oysters instead of alligator tail). If you're curious, the alligator tail tastes like chicken pretty much. Nothing too crazy. Served with hush puppies and your choice of baked potato, fries, corn cobbette, or collard greens.   If you're not into seafood they also have beef or chicken options on the menu.   This is a super casual restaurant away from the strip. Low-key and satisfying."}
{"text":"I would periodically do a pick up to go dinner from this restaurant and finally got to check the dining to see if I would enjoy the meal that way. When I was ready to order, I found out whatever I do take out which I could have selected what I want being I don't eat much that the manager said I have to order what is on the menu, being I don't eat much I wasn't going straight home would be gone at 3 hrs more. The prices were outrageous to just to have to get something I wouldn't be going straight home. Also, the salad bar was too small as you have to keep going back for 2nd or 3rd serving as another customer said there, as well. I talked to the elderly owner and he says you have to order what is put on the menu whether I wasn't going to have a leftover doggy bag otherwise people will be talking and it's happened before as I told him I don't there that much how would people get the word so quickly for fear losing their business and their money. They don't really please the customer like you think this business would want for people to keep coming back. Is very sad!"}
{"text":"Our server John was wonderful, but I did not enjoy the food at all! Very bland, greasy, and the salad bar did not look appealing. I did enjoy the gumbo, but I've had better seafood all around and this wasn't cutting it for me.."}
{"text":"I've been a long time patron of both locations for decades. It started out on West Charleston (only thing out there back in the day) and they expanded to the Nellis location.  They use to be my favorite place for catfish. I have since moved out of state but I return to visit twice a year, and each time I look forward to visiting The Hush Puppy.  This trip, I was sorely disappointed.  I went to the Nellis location where the staff was quite pleasant. I've never had any complaints regarding their service. The staff is always personable and quite friendly. They get a \"10\" for the front of the house! It's the food. My issue is squarely with the food. I traveled from DC looking forward to my trip to The Hush Puppy only to be greeted with sub par food.  The catfish (farm-raised) was paltry and thin. It use to be fluffy and full. The fries use to be soft, fluffy and thick. These had some type of orange coating and were excessively greasy. The price has increased yet the quality hasn't. There's no justification for what you get for your money. $10 for 5pcs of withered fish strips and greasy orange crisp coated fries. Just disgusting. I'm disgusted and my feelings are actually hurt by this poor showing from a place I use to hold in such high gastronomic regard.  They've lost a customer. I know my patronage won't make or break them, but I will tell all my family and friends not to bother bringing me there when I return home to visit. I'll pass.  The two stars are solely for the staff."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but my experience at this restaurant was super good that its a most for me to share it with everyone. The food is very tasty, just as I expected from a seafood restaurant. I got the all you can eat catfish and my husband got the snow crab meal! Very tasty and filling! The salad bar is fresh and have a lot of verity. Our waiter penny was super friendly and helpful. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome crab legs. Best hush puppies ever. Great food overall. Good service. The place is a must go if you're in vegas.."}
{"text":"The fried catfish here is so good. I wish they would bring back the all you can crab legs on Monday."}
{"text":"I use to like their catfish and usually i go to the drive thru but this last 4 times the fish is not good at all, not seasoning as usual, weird taste, fish is feel old ... this place really going down and that sad"}
{"text":"Rating this place is almost unfair. First off...I have an AYCE fetish. I just can't resist it, and I usually can't control myself once I'm there.  Just like Chantel said...\"If we were in another state...but we're in Vegas so...\" Yea. My expectation go way down where AYCE is involved so if it is even decent I'm usually blown away. This place is definitely a pleasant surprise for the price. The service was friendly, and more than adequate for this style of dining.  We went on a Wednesday and had the AYCE ribs, which also includes AYCE catfish, shirmp, a side, hush puppies, and small salad bar, all for only $14.95!  The hush puppies were decent because they are served with honey butter, but don't have anything on the inside like corn, onion or cracklin which are always included in a proper hush puppy, and I expected better when considering it is the establishment's namesake. The star of the salad bar is the cole slaw. For those of you who love good slaw with something fried or grilled, this is the best i've had anywhere in Vegas. We all disagreed as to who has the best ribs in town, but we all agreed that these were the best (& only) AYCE ribs ever, and well beyond what you expect out of a seafood restaurant. They are small, smokey and sweet, not overcooked, but not the mush you get on most buffets. The catfish was good but somewhat inconsistent. I am a fan of small whole fish(\"fiddler's\" as they are called, which they have, but not as part of the daily special), but these are filets. The first batch we had was just OK, but when we got the second round they were greasier, oilier, and had a great salty taste that went great with the sweet slaw, tartar, and an ice cold Abita.  The shrimp were just fried shrimp, but surprisingly plump.  For a side you can get fries or greens. If you are a fan of collards, you HAVE to go here. These are the only greens I've ever had in a restaurant that rival those made by my family in GA. Al dente without being crunchy or mushy, with tons of pork in the mix.  Rather than put everything out Buffet style the serve each order family style, so it's fresh when you get it. In addition to the all you can eat we wanted to sample some of the more unique southern fare, that you often can't find in Vegas without paying an arm and a leg. Frog legs. Great taste, with light breading, and not overcooked like they usually are. $6.95 Fried green tomatoes, nice small thinly sliced, and properly breaded, but they just didn't have the right taste. They were perfectly executed with remoulade but the batter just needs more spices to it. $4.95 Also...Cheapest oysters in Vegas: $9.95 for a dozen. They aren't the best i've had in Vegas, but for the price they get the job done. Fried alligator, which was served in nugget form. Here again the execution was great, and the gator meat tasted great but the breading just doesn't have the right spices to stand up to the dark oily meat so it seems flat tasting. $6.95 So, the 3 of us shared 4 appetizers, had 3 all you can eat meals, and 2 beers a piece and the bill was exactly $100. I haven't been on a Monday yet for the AYCE crab legs, but i'm sure I will be back several times to try each of the daily specials so I'll update as I try more."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time on a Wednesday and had the Wednesday special - All you can eat Baby Back Ribs, Catfish, shrimp and salad bar.   The salad bar was pretty small but delivered offering potato & macaroni salad, Cole slaw and your basic fresh Salad ingredients as well as tartar & cocktail sauce. I tried the potato & macaroni salad, but went heavy on the cole slaw adding some tartar sauce to it along with some salt & pepper at the table and it was pretty good.  The odd shaped hush puppies came to the table steaming hot along with some whipped airy honey butter and they were flavorful & good. However I definitely like Long John Silvers bigger round crunchy outer layered hush puppies a lot better.  The Baby back ribs were surprisingly VERY lean and meaty and did not disappoint. Make sure to ask for a side of BBQ sauce to deal with all the meat you will be getting.  The lightly battered Fried Shrimp turned out to be VERY disappointing as they were probably 50-60 count small shrimp that had been deveined and butterflied and heavily breaded despite the \"lightly breaded\" advertised description. I pealed all the breading off and there wasnt much shrimp to be had. I'd almost bet that this is a product that comes in frozen and they just deep fry them. Very disappointing and NO MATCH for the Fremont Casino's Friday Lunch Buffets BIG lightly hand breaded fried shrimp.   The Fried Catfish was (as advertised) lightly floured and very good and hearty and no bones. I substituted collard greens for french fries and they were very good as well.  Overall it was pretty good and I am finally glad I went and tried it. I will definitely go back at some point and will bring a much bigger appetite with me and will be skipping the shrimp."}
{"text":"Food was tasty! We had the 2.5 lb crab legs and the AYCE catfish and shrimp. Food tasted well. Would have given more stars but we were unable to fully enjoy our food due to the annoyance of flies. I will say the salad bar was clean and ingredients were fresh. Our waitress was attentive and my husband raved about the sweet tea which is rare here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the special. All you can eat Ribs, shrimp and catfish.  Had the alligator bits for appetizer and that was the only thing I was a little dissatisfied with. Server and management were very attentive."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. The hush puppies themselves are great. They come with a side of honey butter and it's really hard to put them down. I also tried a catfish po boy, frog legs and alligator. The frog and alligator were great. Tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked. The po boy on the other hand was really lacking flavor. The fish was cooked well, but the bacon on the sandwich wasn't great and the bun was overwhelming. The sandwich is really what's keeping me from giving this place 4 stars. I'll definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Hush puppy... Is a joke,the only good thing about this place is the food is cheap, besides that this place needs to close re-open under new management and change there name to Wasteoftime.com thumps down"}

This night was particularly slow so since it was our first time here he gave us a little tour and history of the place!! Food was great, customer service was great, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I love seafood. I also know what to order when I go to the Hush Puppy. This is an older, but still popular place known for its seafood and all-you-can-eat specials.   Most entrees come with a side and the salad bar. The salad bar is one reason for the lack of a better rating. It's a poor excuse for a salad bar (not that I'm a huge fan of a salad bar). It's actually really quite disgusting. Every time I have been there it seems to be warm, not cool as a salad bar should be, and has a smell in the area that is unpleasant to say the least. I would never dream of getting any food from the salad bar, but they also put condiments on the bar, making it a necessary stop while dining.   I love the colossal shrimp. They're  so good. The first time I visited, I was disappointed because they only give you 6 butterflied fried prawns. After eating, it was actually quite a nice portion, and delicious. I actually had a combination this evening with a blackened filet of tilapia and the colossal shrimp, and it is my new favorite. The hush puppies they give when seated are also very tasty, along with the honey butter they serve with it.   My other issue; however, with the Hush Puppy is my guests' dishes... They are always dissatisfied! Most others are intrigued by the AYCE specials they have and order that. This evening, my guest was actually talked into ordering an AYCE catfish, fried, and peel-and-eat shrimp.  They piled on the peel-and-eat and cheap fried shrimp (nothing like the quality of the colossal) and only gave him 1 piece of catfish. When informing the server he was dissatisfied with the boiled shrimp, they returned again with a basket full of the cheap fried shrimp and only 1 piece of catfish. The shrimp are obviously cheaper, but it was so blatant each time with gobs of cheap shrimp and 1 piece of catfish.  All in all, I will be back to Hush Puppy. I love seafood and I know what to order. If I can offer any advice to fellow diners is to order anything BUT the AYCE specials.. They will give you loads of yummy hush puppies and cheap items and skimp on the real goods."}

If delicious food isn't enough of an incentive for you to try this restaurant give it a shot for the excellent service. Our waitress Debbie was very efficient and courteous. Frannie, one of the managers, came by our table to make sure everything was fine. But the absolute highlight of the evening was John Lopez, the house \"maitre d\" and customer appreciation aficionado. Johnny came by our table numerous times to make certain our dining experience was the best it can be, and he's very good at his job. He's one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet.

{"text":"This is a great place for a casual dinner as they don't open till 5:00 PM.  The wait staff are very attentive and friendly and provide good service.  The catfish is very good, the shrimp is good and the salad bar is good but none of it is exceptional.  They do have another store over on Nellis Blve and it is newer but we can't offer an opinion of it.  As tourist from Texas, we still think it was worth the drive from the Strip out to the place for something different.    Give the a try when you next visit Las Vegas."}

{"text":"Dined in on Saturday night. We have been Customer's for about 19 years. Normally a five star experience - putting aside the dated atmosphere, the non-working ceiling fans and the seedy neighborhood...the catfish \"fiddlers\" and the fried shrimp were excellent. The service was understaffed and lackluster. The Hush Puppies, normally a favorite served with honey butter, were served with an unidentifiable oleo margarine type substance with an aftertaste of honey...not at all consumable, disallowing enjoyment of a staple item. If you prefer catfish fillets or farm raised catfish, be advised the supplier has been changed and the quality reflects a one star rating. The salad bar is awesome, with the exception of the change in quality and taste of the once homemade tartar and cocktail sauces that now may reflect a journey to smart and final by the longtime owner. If Miss Rosie was still here and not in retirement in Puerto Rico...five stars would adorn this catfish destination overall. Otherwise, head South to Texas."}
{"text":"This an awesome down home southern restaurant. The food is amazing, the best catfish fillets I've had in quite some time.  Their gator nuggets were very tender and so flavorful! The staff is super friendly from John greeting us at the table and our waitress Pam. We will be back again and again. I recommend all to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get southern fried catfish is Las Vegas.  The fish is fried to perfection and is light and tasty.  Not to mention the affordable all you can eat catfish special. The salad bar is simple and traditional. Great pasta, macaroni and potato salad. Also the homemade tartar sauce is delicious, thick and creamy.  Fried alligator at most places it's tough and rubbery but NOT at The Hush Puppy. The alligator is tender and flavorful.  The only thing preventing it form being 5 stars is the hours and the all you can eat catfish.  Don't get me wrong, I ALWAYS order the all you can eat catfish, my issue is you have to really stay on the waiters and waitresses to get \"all you can eat\". After your initial order they ask you if you want more, but they bring you one or two pieces, then after that they sometimes push the check on you. I understand they maybe trying to keep costs down, but if you offer all you can eat, then expect people are going to eat a lot and be available to bring them plenty of fish.  Lastly the hours.  I'm a big lunch person and I only eat at this restaurant on Sundays, when they are open at noon. I understand mom and pop businesses are limited, but I really think they can increase profit by being open at noon the rest of the week, or at least on Saturday."}
{"text":"Food was great Service was great I had a great time The atmosphere quaint love the water fountain and the whole set up of the restaurant  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today to have dinner with my dad before he leaves tomorrow. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the overall visit. We got there a few minutes before it opened and apparently seeing all the waiting customers outside made them want to open ten minutes early, cool. We were graciously greeted by all the staff, and we waited less than five minutes to be seated. Our waitresses name was , Penny, she was super sweet, informative, and helpful. We both ordered the catfish po' boy. It came with a choice of side and a trip to the salad bar. Oh, the complimentary hush puppies, with the honey butter, are freaking amazing! Everything from service to food was great!  Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"***PLEASE READ!! I only signed up for Yelp to review this place because of how HORRIBLE the MANAGER was. I didn't even get his name because he was so rude & I was so upset. He was a morbidly obese man. He must've thought I looked like a poor college student who was looking for a discount when I told him I found a hair on my food. He picked it up & left. When this man came back, he gave me the hair & told me \"everyone in the kitchen has black hair\". I couldn't believe he had the nerve. A big FUCK YOU would have been better, thank you! I kept my cool only because I work in the restaurant industry. But I will never be back. The food wasn't even good. I hope this gets back to that nasty manager!"}
{"text":"The Hush Puppy on Charleston is so good. We came for our 2 year anniversary last night June 21, 2016 for dinner. Got the all you can eat with boiled shrimp fried shrimp and catfish. Everything was amazing and our waitress Penny was nothing short of a Southern Bell. She even gave us a tour of the restaurant before we left. The hush puppies and honey butter are my favorite. Can't beat the price either $15.95 and it includes a small salad bar. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I was expecting this place to have the best darn hushpuppies in town.... I was very mistaken. The hushpuppies were more like corn bread nuggets, nothing like the cornmeal fried delights that I'm used to. They were good... but they were disappointing at the same time. I think they should rename this place \"Mediocre Southern Comfort Food.\"  Most of the meal choices earn you a trip to their \"salad bar.\" Yes.. I put salad bar in quotes because it offered only one choice of lettuce with few veggie toppings, but I will give them credit that they did have a large variety of dressings.  Alligator tail: A good appetizer. The breaded deep fried nuggets of gator did not have any distinguishing flavors. I could have been eating fried chicken nuggets and I would not have known the difference. However, the breading did have good seasoning and the nuggets were crispy so that is a plus.  The freshwater catfish was thinner and milder in flavor whereas the farm-raised catfish was thicker with a stronger flavor. Both preparations were a big disappointment. The breading was completely bland and the fried fillets weren't crispy. So it was an overall soggy flavorless dish. The only thing that made it palatable was the cocktail sauce that I dipped it in. If you ever had the opportunity to eat at Catfish Alley- this place pales in comparasion.  The fried shrimp was a little better, but I could have gotten better fried shrimp from the Red Lobster.  Plus side: the catfish/shrimp dishes are AYCE so if you have a large appetite you can eat your weight in fried seafood, but for me and my husband, we left full... but not satisfied."}
{"text":"Party of two. Seated immediately. Almost empty restaurant - Two groups in there . Clean establishment   Orders: Sweet tea with no ice - had bad after taste from the machine or whatever it was being held in . Gross!  Basket of fries - clearly taste like these are fried in mixed-use unclean grease. I realize that we went into the restaurant at 935p and it closes at 10pm but... Really guys ???!!! C'mon - if you can't handle the simple stuff, how can I trust you with crab, fish and shrimp ??  Hush puppies are free and are given to you when you're seated. Not too hard to mess-up these little gems but these were bland. Totally void of flavor . Good texture on them but not very tasty at all.   Because of these experiences, We decided not to order anything more- left the restaurant before closing at 10p  Service was nice, joyful and quick."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and DELICIOUS food!!!!!!  The ALL you can eat specials are out of this world and the fried catfish melts in your mouth.  If you are looking for sweet tea and a great meal come to The Hush Puppy you can thank me later"}
{"text":"Oh yeah love my Hush Puppies on Nellis only there is one on Charleston don't like its for tourists and they cook like that too. The hood is Nellis the best I'm just saying"}
{"text":"We took my mother-in-law to Hush Puppies restaurant last night. The last time we ate there was 20 years ago. Unfortunately their food quality has changed. I ordered all you can eat shrimp and catfish, my husband ordered the all you can eat shrimp. The food was bland  and needed seasoning. Our meal came with a salad bar and that was pretty decent. The fries were not even seasoned. The service was great! Our waitress gets five stars. We paid about $53.00 for three dinners which was not bad. The shrimp was breaded but there was more crust than the shrimp. If you want good meaty shrimp, and good catfish I would suggest Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"Great service and very good seafood. Let's get straight to the point. This hometown comfortable eatery is best known for their AYCE catfish and shrimp, plus the seafood platter. They do offer blackened and char-grilled catfish, too. But, it's the fried catfish that really shines here. They have got to have the most flavorful catfish in the entire valley! It's well-cleaned, and lightly corn-breaded with a flavorful coating. If you're lucky enough to show up on a Thursday night, spend the extra $2 and get the all-you-can-eat seafood platter, which includes fried and broiled shrimp, catfish, oysters, and clams! We loved the kind service and helpful servers. It took a little longer than we wanted to get started. But, once we got going, the re-orders were all hot, fresh and double-sized. The hush puppies are sweet and delicious, especially with the served honey butter. A salad bar is included with the AYCE meals. It's not a huge salad bar, certainly no reason to show up for that alone. But, it does the job. Good potato and macaroni salads. Great cole slaw, too. I look forward to trying their crab legs and ribs!"}
{"text":"Hmmm...where do I begin?? Firstly, my friend mentioned this place was good. She said the hush puppies were huge and to die for. Welp...we tried it while visiting Vegas. Thumbs down!!   Upon entry, the place smelled of a boo-boo diaper, no exaggeration! Bad sign from the start. The place was rustic looking and seemed to have antique or very old furniture. Maybe that was the intended feel, I don't know. Menu options were fairly limited. I ordered seafood gumbo and crab legs appetizer. My friend ordered fried catfish and fries.   A basket of hush puppies came. Booooo! Clearly by the picture I posted, they are not huge. They look like Jamaican festival bread and tasted like fake hot dog on-a-stick batter. The sweet butter didn't help. \"A\" for effort.  Our food came. Gumbo was just okay. I've never cooked it and bet mine would taste comparable. That's not saying much. Crab legs were sweet; that is, the parts I could enjoy. I ate ONE hot leg of the bunch. The rest were ice cold at the bottom and lukewarm up the rest. I even asked my friend to touch them to make sure. Yep, I was right.   I sent them back and requested a new batch. The waitress comes back and says, \"Try these and see if they're better.\" How about they were the same legs reboiled!! I broke a few to check for hot meat. Those same legs were broken. Lol! I said, \"They're the same legs but yes, they're warmer than the last.\" Obviously, she wasn't concerned with her level of integrity with that lie. Then again, maybe the cooks made her believe the legs were a new batch. Whatever! I was already beyond hungry, the legs still were partially cold and I ate them anyway. I don't like sending food back and I was ready to get the hell out of there.   The 2 stars is for effort. The owner or manager walked around and greeted people. That was nice. Staff was friendly and welcoming others as we left. As for my experience here...blahhh! I'll pass."}
{"text":"Awsome french fries last month now there different. I would recomend the catfish and crab legs and the ribs"}
{"text":"My friend and I used to eat here years ago every Sunday. Everything has changed now. The portions are smaller and the price is higher. I am very disappointed will not eat here anymore as there are many other restaurants in Las Vegas. I ordered catfish dinner and the portions of fish were xtremely small."}
{"text":"Before last week, my boyfriend and I had never been to Las Vegas, so I decided to do a little research of local restaurants that served seafood that were NOT buffets. We are both big crab and lobster buffs, and I wanted to find hot, fresh crab legs that hadn't been sitting in ice while lines of people annhilated them like they'd never seen food before. I came across reviews of this little \"hole in the wall\" establishment and wrote down the address. If you have a rental car, or are visiting someone with a car, it's perfect. However, a cab ride from a hotel on the strip will cost you 25 bucks to get there; a tad steep, but I think it was definitely worth every penny.   We came there for one reason and one reason only: all you can eat crab legs. I can't say anything about their catfish or the salad bar, but after looking over the menu for the heck of it, they do have a large selection of seemingly authentic southern dishes; gator bites, fried oysters, etc. Also, the service is extremely friendly and very efficient; our waitress wouldnt let our crab plate get empty or the bucket for the shells too full, but she would always ask if were ready for another plate full so they wouldn't get cold. Even with tables everywhere, she never seemed flustered and made small talk with every table.   The crab legs themselves were delicious; really large legs and claws and none of them short of meat. We also tried the Rio seafood buffet and the crab legs at the Hush Puppy were 10x better. A buffet is too scrambled with people fighting over crab legs, so to get them served to you whenever you want and as much as you want while theyre piping hot is a wonderful treat. The only downside, like previously mentioned, is how far it is from the strip. But, after eating what was quite possibly 10 pounds each, my boyfriend and I left full, satisfied, and extremely pleased with everything the Hush Puppy had to offer. If you do plan a trip to Vegas, make sure there is a Monday on your vacation!"}
{"text":"We were looking at real estate and exploring neighborhoods in the area when I realized we were only 10 minutes from this restaurant. Thanks to Yelp I'd heard about this hidden gem. When you walk in, there is a chalkboard listing daily specials. Wednesday's special is all you can eat baby back ribs, catfish, and shrimp for $18.95. This also includes a side of French fries or substitute for collard greens or a corn cobbette for $.50 AND a trip to the salad bar. What?!? We all agreed that it was a no-brainer to get the daily special. The food was great, but the first round of catfish was room temperature instead of piping hot. Once that was replaced, everyone was content. Also, our waitress was phenomenal. Violet (??) serviced our entire section fast and efficiently and was smiling the whole time."}
{"text":"I love this place the food amazing the staff helpful ....must try green tomatos ...fresh water fish ;^)"}
{"text":"The Hush Puppy is a pretty neat little gem. We had our pup with us, visiting the area, and since there is no outdoor dining area, we opted to take the drive through. Note - the dine in menu offers more variety than the drive through menu offerings.  Ordering was fast and easy and prices are quite reasonable for the quailty of the food. We ordered the fried green tomatoes, alligator tail, hushpuppies, sweet tea, pecan pie, collard greens and the #8 (catfish fillets, shrimp and fries). Everything was great and my husband who grew up in the South (Georgia/Alabama) said that the fried catfish in particular was spot on and VERY GOOD! The collards greens were also perhaps the best ones we have ever had and the fried shrimp were equally as great.  If you're in the area and looking for a good fill of Southern fried catfish and other \"Southern\" hints of food, we certainly recommend giving the Hush Puppy a try."}
{"text":"If you were born south of the Mason Dixon Line, you have been in many places that resemble the Hush Puppy.  My family has been here many times and my first visit did not disappoint.  The decor comes from Louisiana shacks and there is nothing fancy in this down home kitchen.  Hot hush puppies are delivered and drink orders taken.  If you like raw oysters, these gulf selects fit the bill without busting your wallet.  When's the last time you paid less than 15 bucks a dozen in this town?  Down home fried oysters, shrimp and catfish (fillets or fiddlers-entree or AYCE) lead the offerings.  Throw in crawfish rice, collard greens, gumbo, fried green tomatoes, gator to back it up and you got yo'self a meal you haven't had in a long time.  John Lopez (Manager) suggested the sweet potato pie or pecan pie for dessert, but we were stuffed.  Imagine our surprise when John handed us these desserts to try when we got home.  My sisters destroyed the sweet potato before I could try it but the pecan is the best I've had since moving from NOLA.  All in all, good food, great service, affordable pricing and southern cooking like you haven't had anywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"I never been comfortable eating at place that does NOT give you napkins with your take out order! What other corners are being cut to save money?? That is tasteless in my opinion. I ordered the catfish and ask for lemon juice and I was told the DO NOT HAVE Any...who sells crab shrimp oyster and gator meat but no LEMON Juice!!! I asked the manager for some he thought I was from another planet and said people usually want hot sauce! I'm African American and DONT LIKE HOT SAUCE so good luck getting me back there again!! But I will send the hot sauce loving clientele you're used to your way"}
{"text":"So one night we craved for some catfish & raw oysters. (Okay, okay..no hankie-pankie here, we were just HUNGRY) What's the best place to grab one? Couldn't think of anywhere else besides Hush Puppies.   Nice big, bright sign by the street, you won't miss it. We opted for the drive thru coz the kids were fast asleep in the backseat. Although there was a little mixed up in our order, they were very apologetic about it &  was fast in resolving the issue.   The catfish came steaming hot & the oysters were fresh. Nyum!! Happy tummy here!!! Customer service was impeccable.   PRO: food, customer service CON: waiting time  Coming back & would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Three words. Fried green tomatoes. They're life changing. No joke. I'm a tomato lover-I even grow them in my own backyard in the summer and eat them at almost every meal until they're gone but for whatever reason, I've never had a fried green tomato. Until last night. And I'll never be the same.   I went through the drive thru at this Hush Puppy location and ordered them easily enough. It's your typical, run of the mill drive thru but an added plus is the menu board before you get to the actual speaker so you can check out the offerings if you're behind someone else.   I was pleasantly surprised that the fried green tomatoes were only $2.99. At that price, I was expecting maybe 3 tomatoes - just a small order. I was wrong. That cheap price is a steal for sure! The order comes with 6 good sized tomatoes. Too much for me to finish so the lucky hubby got some, too!   Now for the nitty gritty. Oh my heavens these little fried nuggets are pure heaven. They're perfectly salted, perfectly fried, not too greasy, super juicy and warm on the inside and I'm quite certain I've never tasted anything so good. They would hold up by themselves but just to add another layer of deliciousness, they're served with this remoulade sauce that I'd like to buy in a gallon container if I could. It paired amazingly with the tomatoes and as impossible as it seems, made them taste even better.   The girl working the drive thru was very friendly and helpful. It's a longer wait than a normal fast food drive thru but that's understandable when you taste how incredibly delicious this stuff is. Don't forget to tip the drive thru workers, people! This ain't McDonald's - it's a restaurant. And even though they're not in the dining room, they deserve tips for good service, too!   I'll be back. Many, many times. Next time I'll come inside and try an actual dinner cause if the rest of their food is half as good as the fried green tomatoes, good Lawd help me and my waistline!"}
{"text":"Pros: Mostly every night they have different specials, seafood is great, fiddler is amazing, service is on point and very friendly, I've never had to wait even when it's busy, and clean. They also are apart of Rhthyme Kicthen and share the same menu items but Hush Puppies is casual dining and more affordable. They also have a drive thru which is the only way I end up ordering it.  Cons: For dine in Fiddler is only available for all you can eat, no substitutions, They don't serve rice, never answer the phone so I can see what's the nights specials, only open for dinner."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here & I'm going to be honest... I was really looking forward to trying the Alligator tail, so I ordered the Big Bayou. Catfish was deep fried, as well as the Oysters & the Alligator tail, so for me it almost tasted all the same to me. The shrimp in the platter was good though as well as the complimentary hush puppies. Service was fairly good. So I'm giving this restaurant the benefit of the doubt. Next time, I'd like to try the steak & ribs."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 30+ years. As a local las vegan my family has been coming here since I was a kid! No matter how long it's been, every time I return it's just as good as I remember! Our waitress penny was great! Kept the baskets of fried fish and shrimp coming! She was very nice and talked about working there since the 80s! It's a great place when customers and employees keep coming back for years!"}
{"text":"First off, the service was very good. At least 2 different people came to the table to make sure that everything was fine. We had the catfish and shrimp dinner, which is all you can eat. The fish is lightly seasoned and not overcooked, but I have to say that the shrimp were a little bready, but crispy. The hush puppies were great with the honey butter they give you. They also have a drive thru. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place has been on W. Charleston forever.  It was here ever since I can remember.  It's food, quality, and flavor have not changed over the years...and thankfully so, since it is really perfect.  We went just last night to celebrate a friends birthday and our server, Gee, was absolutely AWESOME!!!  She was so friendly, she really worked the room and you can see the enjoyment on other patrons faces.  She was on it and knew when to order us more \"all you can eat catfish\" so there was no lapse in our meals. It was a perfect experience and definitely recommend this restaurant.  I recommend asking for Gee, as well."}
{"text":"I heart this place so hard, y'all. It's been here since the '70s, ancient by Vegas standards. From the adorable, homey decor (the waterfall, the lights!) to the welcoming service (manager checking on us and giving the kids free ice cream, waitress making sure the fellas at the table next to us are getting their preference of farm vs freshwater), it's the real deal. Crab legs are a bargain here and yummy, shrimp, oysters, clam strips, cat fish, and the ribs are actually crave worthy, too. I wanted to cheek kiss all the servers on the way out."}
{"text":"Had Some frog legs, whole (fiddler) catfish and filet catfish, with fries, salad bar.. Of course the chow chow too. Fast service, delicious food, and never fails me. I love this location on Charleston, I don't like the location on Lamb at all..."}
{"text":"First, the good. Our server Savana (sp?) was polite, friendly, & attentive. She deserves to be working somewhere nice. Having not been there in decades the first thing I looked for was the Health Dept rating, hooray, it's an A. A basket of hush puppies was delivered to our table just after being seated. Served with honey butter they were just ok. For a signature item they were pretty bland. I realize this place is known for the catfish which is not my favorite so perhaps ordering the all-you-can-eat combo with the Freshwater Fish Filets & Fried Shrimp wasn't the best idea. Having been warned off the fries by the staff we ordered the baked potato. Dinner includes a lack luster salad bar, I just had some cole slaw. After ordering I took some time to really look around. Tired, worn, dirty are the descriptors that come to mind. A pony wall topped with dusty silk plants, all the wood finishes worn off, backs of the chairs were dirty, etc. Dinner was served in a timely manner. Granted the menu describes the fish as \"thin & mild\" but that was an understatement. No seasoning at all. Fish, cornmeal breading. That's it. Shrimp was of the frozen grocery store variety. All this goodness plus beverages for two was $50. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best. Fried Oysters. Ever. 'Nuff said. Yelp says it's not enough, so the hush puppies and pecan pie are also to die for :)"}
{"text":"I never could have imagined 10+ years ago that I would grow to love this place!! When Vegas was a vacation spot for my huge family and I, this was one of the required stops that my father and his brothers had to make. My cousins and I were always so reluctant to go!!  \"NOT THE HUSH PUPPY AGAIN!\" we would always say. Now that I am \"all grown-up\" I have new found appreciation for this place. I find myself here about once a month. So when they say \"father knows best\" it is so true. The Hush Puppy is great southern style food that any palate can appreciate. The catfish is so good!! You can have farm-raised or wild caught....either way it is delicious. If you like gumbo...they have best!!  The gumbo is great and the fried oysters are delectable! Speaking of fried.....FRIED GREEN TOMATOES ( that's right...it's not just movie, it's a delicacy for all of you that aren't familiar with southern cuisine!)...they have them and they are to die for! The sweet tea ain't too shabby either!! If you are looking for a great southern style feast...this is your place.  Check out there all you can eat specials throughout the week. I.E. All you can eat catfish and crab legs....YUM!!  (Just in case you were wondering....the answer is Yes!! They actually do serve hush puppies and they are homemade, fresh, hot and good!!)"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal every 4 month customer to Hush Puppy for at least the last 5 years! Going through the drive thru for my occasional jar of chow chow and delicious hush puppies for the ride home!   Now plump, pregnant, and just at an extreme loss of energy I knew it was time to take the relationship a step further and dine in! Along with my sister in law we arrived as a party of 7 on a Sunday evening around 5pm! The parking lot was packed, but to my surprise there was no wait and there was a cool section just ready and waiting!   We were quickly greeted by our server , Davida, who was really nice and informative concerning the menu. After a few explanations and suggestions we ordered 2 all you can eat fish and shrimp, 1 all you can eat adult fish, 2 kids all you can eat fish, and a full rack of ribs! Oh yeah, I began with an order of crab legs! Our meals included the self serve salad bar and I must say it was nicely stocked with essentials for a great salad and sides that complimented fish/seafood well. I'll add, being of southern roots myself, I'd wished they had some sort of sliced onions to make the \"fish fry\" complete. Nevertheless I was happy! Especially to see the beets!   The crab legs arrived perfectly before the main course with drawn butter! They were very hot, meaty, and delicious! Shortly after the meals arrived hot and looking incredible. The kids and grown ups alike enjoyed the fresh fried fish! The cornmeal coating was light and crisp!   The fries it came with had the consistency of curly fries, but meatiness ( idk what's up with me and meat right now) of a regular fry which was a great cross! The ribs were actually really really good! My daughter is allergic to fish and was actually able to enjoy the ribs without swelling up like a puffer fish from poor sanitation practices!   While fat, full, and trying not to drool, a handsome older gentleman named John stopped by to see if we needed medical attention... possibly because we turned into zombies that barely budged while resisting comatose. He was happy to know that we got our puppies hushed and we're satisfied. John was even as kind enough to send ice cream out to my babies, on the house! That's a lost art!   Usually your nickel and dimed these days at restaurants, but it felt like a sense of family here. For that I could never complain about spending any amount of money here! If your ever in the area and craving great food! This place is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for the longest time to see how it was so when my friends Herbie and Michael called me up at the last second to ask me if I wanted to go to dinner and I suggested this place,they were all for it.They had been here before and had obviously liked it.They have a huge parking lot.The interior has a quasi rustic feel to it and is very relaxing. The waitress,Penny,immediately recognized my friends.She was very personable,friendly and efficient and has been working here for 28 of the 40 years this place has been opened.I started off with the basket of hush puppies and the salad bar.I had some macaroni,cole slaw and potato salad with some bacon bits on them and that was a pleasant start.I ordered the Big Bayou which consists of Louisiana Shrimp,Alligator tail,New Orleans Fried Oysters and Farm-raised Catfish fillet and I had collard greens as my side dish.My two friends both had the Blackened Catfish Fillets.We all found the food to our liking and I would not hesitate to come back here again,either with them or some other friend(s) that I could introduce this place to. I can see why this place has been in business for 40 years.I enjoyed it very much.I hope you come here and find it as appealing as I did."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing the hush puppy on w charleston for the past 40 years.   Started patronizing there when they were brand new to Las Vegas.  The food have been consistently good.  The service has always been excellent.  Especially server Debbie   She goes ABOVE and BEYOND taking care of clients.   THANK YOU!!!!!"}
{"text":"A Vegas classic for sure. Been coming to eat here (or grab a box to go) since I was a kid. While the restaurant has seen better days (80s and 90s) it still is the best spot in the valley for all you can eat catfish and shrimp.   My main complaint has always been their tight policy on extra tarter sauce for to go boxes...just one for a box of 5 pieces is ridiculous.   The past few years they have been serving these battered/coated fries which are just not good. I long for the steak fries they used to serve for the first 20 years they were in operation."}
{"text":"I really don't see the hype with this place. I feel like maybe 5 years ago it use to be a REALLY GOOD spot but now it's just lacking in every department.   Upon entering the building there was this ungodly stench that hit me at the door and seemed to flow to half of the restaurant. I was overjoyed when my party was seated in the back because there was NO way I could consume food while inhaling that horrendous smell.   The food tasted stale and old. I ordered the all you can eat fish and shrimp combo (not  sure of the proper name for my meal). The food did come out in a timely manner. But it just tastes disgusting. I'm almost at a loss of words for how bad the food was. It wasn't that it wasn't seasoned well...it was just dry and gross.   The quality of the food reminded me of fast food. That's the only way to explain it. I will definitely be skip out on this joint.   The only pro to this establishment is the staff. They are EXTREMELY nice, hardworking, and quick. If only the food could match the customer service."}
{"text":"The biggest tastiest crab legs ever, seasoned to perfection. Gumbo, fried oysters, and a drive thru.  ."}
{"text":"Havent been to this restaurant in over 15 years. I've always loved it and couldn't wait for my out of town family members (that are great cooks) to enjoy. I thought my fish was good, they disliked it, the corn was dry, the crab legs were EXTREMELY SALTY, the all you can eat shrimp was a joke, they were full of flavorless bread, the shrimp was small and couldn't be tasted, ot wasnt even shaped like fried shrimp, it looked like something from a child's menu and tasted like a cheap frozen brand from the supermarket. The waitress agreed to have manager deduct 50% of the salary crab leg entree. I was ok with that, but when she brought the adjusted bill back to the table, she didnt give me the itemized bill. My bad for not asking for it at that time. But I did call manager 10 minutes after I left and asked him to read the bill to me. Turns out I didnt get 50% off the $28.00 crab entree. I was given $6 off. I treated my family to dinner and overall I was embarrassed and four of the six of us were dissatisfied. I should have been given more of an adjustment and the manager wasnt willing. To be fair... the potato salad, hush puppies, baked potatoes, diet pepsi and salad bar was good. Wont ve returning."}
{"text":"Very delicious, I lived in the south for over 20 years and I know southern food. This is the closest it gets. The cornmeal crusted fried catfish was delicious and perfectly cooked. Pecan pie it was great tasting and will surely take care of your sugar rush. The only negative is the portion size and the hush puppies tasted like corndog batter and Need more catfish."}
{"text":"My mother in law took us here for all you can eat (AYCE) crab legs on Monday night. I've always wanted to try this place and this was the perfect opportunity!  Good food and great company.  Monday nights also seem to be extremely crowded! I was fortunate to not have to wait so long in line since we got there early in the evening. I felt even more lucky as we were leaving.  TONS of people waiting for a seat.  We were set in what was almost a private dining room with our party of 8 people.  It was nice and cozy.  It was crab legs galore! And all you can eat.  The hush puppys with honey and butter were awesome!  My only complaint about this place is that the waiter was very sparse when it came to drinks, taking or initial order and drink refills.  We were keen to ask ahead of time when he would appear for more crab legs, so we weren't left wanting too long.  Parking seems to be an issue as well if you do not get there early... if you do plan on eating here, try to beat the crowd!  I'd come here again, absolutely!  I love crab and the caliber of the crabs, claws and meat were right up there."}
{"text":"The customer service is strange.....the salad bar area smells funny....the hush puppies are really tasty  IF you dip them in the honey butter. The shrimp and fish are tasty. I would say unless you haven't eaten in a week, the all you can eat doesn't make any since because after the salad and hush puppies, you don't need all that fried food."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place this evening and I'm very pleased to say that it was really good.  I got a 3-piece Farm-Raised Catfish Dinner which comes with fries and hush puppies (and tarter sauce, which I passed on).  And I also got an order of Fried Green Tomatoes.  All were delicious.  My one drawback is that the Green Tomato Relish is extra and it has way too many onions in it.  But  other than that, the fish filets were very good and fairly large, three was more than enough for me.  The fries were good.  And the hush puppies were perfect.  The fried green tomatoes were rather small, but good.  I prefer ranch with them instead of their sauce.  The place looked like it was straight out of the 70's.  I got my food to go, but from what I could tell, it was clean.  Definitely would eat here again, the next time I'm craving catfish and hush puppies."}
{"text":"Just awesome. Food is great environment is awesome for all ages. Try there catfish and fries."}
{"text":"This is such a warm friendly restaurant.  The food is exceptional by far. The hush puppies were so good and that honey and butter was the best. Every time I visit Las Vegas this will be my go to restaurant. Make sure you check this restaurant while in Las Vegas.  The greens were delicious and the fried shrimp.  My husband had the catfish and said it very good."}
{"text":"I felt like i was at home!!!  Not my house home, but its just so cozy and laid back i felt uber comfy!!  I got all you can eat shrimp and catfish pretty tasty I must say.  The highlight was definitely the fried green tomatoes.  And those hush puppies are addicting"}
{"text":"The Hush Puppy, like its name implies, is a southern joint located off the strip in Las Vegas. My friend Stephen told me that every Monday night, they have all you can eat snow crabs. I noticed that the day I was there was a Monday, so I could not let this glorious opportunity go to waste.   Our table of six finished three buckets. The key part is to eat the buckets real fast while the crabs are still warm. Once they start cooling down, they don't taste as good. In this case, you have to be the hare and leave the turtle in the dust.  The snow crabs that they serve are not your typical Chinese buffet cheap crabs. I am happy to say that these snow crabs, albeit not as good (less meat) than the Alaskan king crabs, are still very delicious. On a side note, they have some of the best cole slaw I have ever had in my life.  If you're ever in Vegas on a Monday, you have to try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a lot lately and I had some time to spare today, I love the exterior so I came on in. I'm a local but I'm from Missouri. This place reminds me so much of the nicest places in Southern Missouri. All you cat eat, quality seafood at affordable prices. All wood interior and exterior with fabulous, authentic decor.  I was blown away at how clean, spacious and lovely the atmosphere was.  I ordered the Blackened Catfish. It was the best catfish I've ever had in my life. Plump, large, seasoned and grilled to perfection. I was approached by John who was incredibly friendly, professional and obviously knows everything about customer service. He gave me a tour of the entire facility and I was amazed. Apparently they've been there 40 years!! Anyone from Vegas knows, that in itself is a tremendous accomplishment! The service was fast and friendly and John came by toward the end of my meal to offer the fried shrimp and fried catfish for me to try! I just LOVE finding places that still have solid customer service and know how to treat a guest! I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"I have a confession to make.  I went for the Hush Puppies.  Hush Puppies got their name back in the day when the dog would bark while you were cooking and the cook would ball up cornbread, throw it at them and uther, \"HUSH PUPPY\".  Honest, true story.  Let get down to the nitty and the gritty.  The Hush Puppy is a great casual family restaurant in which to dine. One of their most great tasting meal is their CATFISH.  It even comes in a Senior Special price at 10.95 which includes 2 pieces of CATFISH, Fries, Salad Bar and a drink.  The CATFISH  Although it was good, I usually get better CATFISH at The Hush Puppy on LAMB or NELLIS.  I can't remember which.  The thing is this one is now the closest to me. That one was the closet to me years ago.    The FISH seemed to be over fried to the point where the meal was very hard and gritty.  That being said it still tasted good.  Either that or I was hungry  FRIES  I don't normally eat fries and these were no exception.  They were not only greasy, but, also, over cooked.  So much so they were more like FRENCH FRIES.  I offered them to my date he did even want them.  SALAD BAR  There were beets on the SALAD BAR.  Love Beets, Lemon, and Cucumber.  Could have used some red onion and maybe alphafa sprouts, I don't know how to spell it, but whose complaining it THE HUSH PUPPY.  Drink  It did just was it as supposed to do.  I was no longer thirsty.. Raspberry tea always hits the spot.  This, of course was endless refills.    Service  The waitress who served us made us fill at at home.   Serving us with a smile and great conversation. Not to mention helping us to select a meal with our budget.  Brought us our drinks is record time.   We went to get our salad and when we came back the bus person had dumped our drinks.   They were quickly replaced with the others when they realized the error.  The Five stars were for the service.  There of them maybe for the food.  I've taste better and I give them A for effort.  Perhaps I should go there on a better day.  WE all have those."}
{"text":"I've had enough...I can no longer do it anymore. I've regularly visited Hush Puppy, and my most recent visit is the last time that I'll eat there. At first I was impressed with the mediocrely prepared food...it is decent. But the restaurant itself is grimy, has a mildew smell, and the standards of food are slipping more and more. I ordered the combination plate of catfish and shrimp--bottomless--the fish is CAKED in a hard corn meal batter. The fish and shrimp are overcooked. The greens tasted old--I've been cooking greens all of my adult life, and I know the difference between fresh greens, day old greens, and greens older then s few days. The greens I had with my meal were older than a few days. (C'mon, where's the respect for the food and the customer?).   The hush puppies are over sweetened logs of fried batter. Please do not be mislead, these are not real hush puppies. To top it off, my sister-in-law ordered the crab legs, and about half way through eating them, a small long green flying insect came crawling out of the crab legs. Told the manager and he said, \"oh really\", then proceeded to ask how other members in our party was enjoying their meal.   I will not be returning. I do not recommend this place to you or your loved ones."}
{"text":"My friend and I, both Las Vegas natives, were so excited to finally try this place. We came in tonight, Sunday July 3rd at 6:40 pm. There was a large group waiting in the waiting room and a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\". We waited for    10 minutes after I finally decided to try and find an employee to let them know that people were waiting. I found a waitress and asked if there was a hostess and she rudely told me that the hostess was busy setting up for a party and we'd just have to wait. Uhm? Okay. We waited for another 5 minutes before the hostess came up to us and just asked \"how many?\" No smile. No 'thank you for waiting'. No welcome to 'Hush Puppy.' Nothing. As someone who works in the service industry I was already so taken back by the lack of professionalism and atmosphere. She took us to a table and put the menus down and walked away. Every. Single. Table. was dirty. Two tables had people sitting and dining at them. That was it. The rest of the room was filled with dirty plates and cups. Needless to say, I have no reviews or anything to say about the actual food here because who in their right mind would stay and eat at this restaurant after the staff's behavior and the lack of cleanliness. Didn't want to risk getting sick. We left immediately and as we were walking out the hostess sarcastically and for the first time smiling said, \"thank you for coming, have a good night.\"  Management and owner beware. You've got a staff running what seems to once have been a good place into the ground."}
{"text":"Great food. At an awesome price. The Tuesday special was a hit! Service was on point. My wife and I had a very good time. I will definitely be back again. Truly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly good.... All u can eat Catfish was on point...gator tail decent and to think that it is the cheaper version of Rythm Kitchen..."}
{"text":"Great prices for great food. Food was great but the owner needs to do some upgrades to this place and make it look decent. Overall the food was great and our waitress was very nice and attentive.  I ordered crab legs and salad. The salad bar had a good variety and was delicious. Hush puppies were absolutely scrumptious and free. I would definitely come back and visit."}
{"text":"Chose this place because we wanted somewhere that was VERY family-friendly since we were going to have four rugrats in tow, at least three of which were notorious for exhibiting past behaviors requiring swift and unscheduled trips back \"out to the car\".   Hadn't been here in years, but I remember it being very loud and very casual. It was still casual, but since there were very few customers besides us, we had to provide the noise. (Thanks, kids). Not sure what happened to the crowds, but it might be menu changes like the no-longer-available AYCE crab legs on Mondays. They now run daily specials, but the all-you can-eats are pretty much limited to shrimp and catfish.  I was pleasantly surprised by the salad bar. Back in the day, it featured a few paltry selections like cole slaw, carrot sticks and some weird pickled green tomato concoction. These are still available, but now they have added a sufficient array of vegetables that you can hook yourself up with a pretty nice salad.  The hush puppies, as others have stated, are pretty bland, but not bad when slathered in the honey butter. Those who ordered the cornmeal- fried catfish seemed to enjoy it; personally, I find those strange dark veins running through it quite off-putting and generally avoid it. Like calamari, it may not taste bad, but there's just something creepy about it.   On the other hand, I am not in the least bit creeped out by oysters (go figure), and the deep fried ones are served with a tasty remoulade. Shrimp stuffed with a spicy, savory crab meat mixture then battered and fried were not bad, and even the french fries were also battered and seasoned. Babygirl was trying to eat clean and got broiled chicken with collard greens and salad, and the Anaconda was eating light so he stuck with the gumbo.   Everyone enjoyed their meals although no one was blown away. If you go, you won't leave hungry and theatmosphere is pleasant unless you happen in on a night when our kids are misbehaving."}
{"text":"Yet another Classic Vegas place that I have been going to ever since I can remember. Seriously, I've been going here so long that I can remember being able to see the entire strip from their dining room. I heard a rumor that they discontinued their AYCE crab night on Monday's that was $25. I think I died a little inside. This was some of the best crab I could find in town. I became a crab snob and wouldn't eat it anywhere else. The catfish is good, but used to be better when they offered it as a fiddler (whole fish), farm and fresh water raised option. Now they just have the thicker, mushy filet and the fiddler style. I personally liked the thinner, crispy filet catfish. The cornmeal they used on their fish is good. The hushpuppies and honey butter are addicting. The salad bar is usually always good. My mom goes nuts for the pickled green tomatos. The service is hit and miss. There are a few servers that have been there a while and are nice, but sometimes the newer ones are super bad and take forever. The ribs there are also very tastey. Sweet tea is very good as well. If you are feeling up to it, I suggest going for the Alligator tail. It's a little different, but worth trying!"}
{"text":"My relatives that live in Vegas swear by this place so when myself and some other family members were visiting from out of town, they suggested we go eat here. The food was underwhelming to say the least, no complaints about the restaurant decor or location but the food just wasn't as good as some people make it out to be. I was anxious to try the frog legs since this was my first time having them and they were good! Even with the cocktail sauce and I hate cocktail sauce. However, the hush puppies were a bit dry and the shrimp and fries I got were not good being that the shrimp was overly breaded and the fries had a weird after taste. I tried my god mother's crab legs and should have gotten that instead. I enjoyed the hospitality of the staff but the food was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas I've passed this restaurant a thousand times always telling myself that I gotta check that place out!  Well today was a long time coming and if you enjoy Southern food and seafood, then Hush Puppies is the place to go!  I ordered the Crablegs and Garvin the all-you-can-eat catfish!  The side cornbread hush puppies and pickled tomatoes was tasty!  We'll be back..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several years ago and I went again last night with my girlfriend and dad.  We had to wait a few minutes because the place was slammed with customers.  Truthfully...there are only two waiters a dishwasher and the cook so if you order it may be awhile especially if you go between 5 and 7 pm.  Besides that the food is southern fried and the catfish is is the bomb.  I didn't like the shrimp too much it tasted a little different.  The tea is super sweet just I like it.  There's not much to choose from on the salad bar but it will hold you over till the main course gets there.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The hush puppy food was ok great fresh salad  Hush puppy,s so good nice and hot all you can eat fish and shrimp was nice too"}
{"text":"Im sorry but I really wasn't feeling the atmosphere nor the food. It was some store bought frozen shrimp and catfish. At least thats how it seemed. The environment was less than inviting and the staff wasn't friendly. I'll never return so good luck if you decide to try it. My former friends loved it. She loved it so much that we are no longer friends behind me not liking this place."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of restaurants in Las Vegas. This one now tops the list of the worst I have ever been to. It was a Wednesday and the special was all you can eat ribs plus shrimp, catfish, fries and a salad. The service was nonexistent. The prices seemed OK until I tasted the food. I did not even finish one piece of catfish. It tasted like it was fried in a mop bucket. The tartar sauce was tasteless and was full of big chunks of onion. The shrimp was decent but the ribs were dry. My glass of iced tea was never refilled even once.  The worst part of my experience at this restaurant was the cleanliness, or lack there of. It is dark and dingy. The tables were greasy and smelly. There was filth, grease, and grime six feet up the wall. I have never been so disgusted in my life. This place would even be turned down by the television show Restaurant Impossible.  Save yourself from the misery that is Hush Puppy. Don't even give them a first thought."}
{"text":"Excellent service waitress was super good. Food was ok. We had the catfish and shrimp. Food taste alil commercial. I'd go again"}
{"text":"The drive through ideas for this place is cool. Recently tried their food earlier this week. The fish was good, I didn't like the fried fish at all, and the alligator was interesting but not bad it was my first time trying it. Food was made fast. The hush puppies are more like hot water corn bread than a actual hush puppy but it is was good!"}
{"text":"If youre visiting Vegas, you have got to try this place! The best down south cooking on the planet! It helps that the service is top-notch! It may not be in the best part of town, but who cares! The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really tasty catfish, shrimp and fixin's.  Our friend took us to the sister location on Nellis a couple of months ago, but this location was more convenient to our hotel.  No worries, this place was just as good!  Excellent service, and the salad bar is a nice touch as well.  As a Bostonian, I'm pretty particular about seafood.  The Hush Puppy fits the bill.  Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!  I don't know if I was there on a good day!  But when I don't feel like cooking my own, guess where I will be?  I'm waiting for you to guess?  Yep...DING DING DING! Hush Puppy!   They aren't afraide to put there foot in there cooking (for those that don't  know, that's a good thing)  Yes, the seasoning on this fish was amazing, I love mine fried hard!  The salad was good, the Baked potatoe, was good!  I just wish they had pepsi products!  lol, If your ever in the area, stop and check it out.  I know there's another one on Chareston, but I havent been to that one."}
{"text":"Fish was dry and hard and the fries were cold I was not impressed at all but the one packet of tartar sauce I was given was great"}
{"text":"Came here for Tuesday's AYCE shrimp dinner.  We received terrible service from our waitress, Brenda. No customer service, no smile whatsoever.  First, she brought out wrong  order to our table so I said that's not what we ordered. She gave us nasty attitude instead of apologizing. Second, I never received fried shrimp and cat fish (comes with my AYCE dinner) so I told her I never got it. She tells me \"You said you don't like catfish.\" NO. I never said that. Why would I say that? \"IF\" I did, what about fried shrimp? Third, I asked her for more shrimp. She just sighed and disappeared. WTH?! She brought out the shrimp giving me a dirty look like she did me a big favor or something. My drink was empty but I didn't bother to ask her for the refill. Fourth, we ordered \"Dried\" no sauce ribs to take out (we made sure and told her twice!), when we got home, we found out it had a lot of spicy sauce on it. Also, we didn't get the side.  Terrible, terrible, terrible service!!! I looked around to see if it was just us receiving this kind of attitude from her but she had shitty attitude to every table she had. Probably she had a bad day but how could she expect good tips from customers?! The food was OK, but we will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Please overlook the very scary decor, frightneningly stained carpet and tiki hut furniture.  This place houses the best hush puppies I've ever had in my entire life. If you're a native or have lived in Vegas long enough and have been coming to the establishment, you can ask for their jalapeno hush puppies. It's one of those quirky things that some people would know just from living in Las Vegas -- kind of like when you want water you ask for a Lake Mead cocktail. The hush puppies are served with the best honey butter I've ever tasted.  It's blended just right - enough honey mixed in with the butter so it just soaks into your hush puppy and makes a wonderful sinful bite of greasified heaven...yum.  On Monday nights this place has all you can eat crab leg nights.  When we lived in Vegas, our friends and I lived for Monday nights. It's the kind of all you can eat crab leg night where you know you have to take off your rings and watch so you don't get 'em all soppy and soaky from the wonderfully freshly steamed crab legs.  I've also eaten their catfish - what a treat that was.  Now when hubby and I go back to visit friends, we always make sure to stay until Tuesday so we can enjoy all you can eat crab legs."}
{"text":"We come here for our hankering for fried fish. They do farm-raised and fresh catfish.  It's a bit greasy, but sometimes that hits the spot. They have steamed shrimp, too, which is a good value.  Try the tangy collard greens.  The french fries will make you reach for the Tum's, though.  The hush puppies are an acquired taste--but I have acquired the taste for it, lol.  Cornbread is okay, a bit dense. I recommend you check your order before leaving the drive-through window.  It has been more than once that my order was not quite right."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a family member. Very good seasoned catfish filets.  The shrimp were also cooked to perfection.  The only draw back that I have was the fact that you can tell you're in a seafood restaurant by the smell. Overall it was very good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service... pleasant atmosphere... our server was always on time ... even the manager came by to check on us"}
{"text":"going to go ahead and copy my friends review since we came here together. first off really deserves 0 STARS, not one.

{"text":"To get this out quickly, the food is ohh so fried. I personally attempt to regulate my fried intake, and hush puppies will be a once in a blue moon treat. but what a treat it is.   I HATE catfish, yet somehow hush puppies has managed to convince me the devils fish is not only edible, but tasty. The meat is not at all gritty, and the batter is fantastic. you can order both fresh and farm raised catfish too!   alligator tail is also very tasty. I like me some Ali tail, and hush puppies does not disappoint. Not too chewy, and not overly battered. Fantastic.  Finally.....Sweet Potato Pie! Can't find good sweet slice outside the south, so just offering this made me happy. If you like sweet potatoes, and you like pie, you will like sweet potato pie. Makes sense right?  P.S Crab legs. Yes, crab legs. And they are generous with them. You get the good legs, not the shriveled legs from the lazy crab that never does push ups. These legs have meat on their bones....or shells, or under the shells....whatever."}
{"text":"Great Food!  But service is lacking in the all you can eat portion of the menu.  We ask"}
{"text":"First of all the company is writing their positive reviews. Everyone that was eating there was miserable. To start off my experience let me tell you that there was hair between the clear plastic on the menu and the paper. It was disgusting. I ignored this and ordered food. Huge mistake! The all u can eat is not feasible when your food takes 30 minutes per plate. The catfish arrived, and I don't expect much from catfish, it's just that the fish they brought was terrible. I took one bite, it was the worst thing I have ever eaten. While there I ate 6 shrimp and a few clam strips. Overall we saw our waitress twice and she never came back to ask if we wanted more. PLease never eat there, it is a horrid experience. Go to Long John Silvers before you go here. The place is not clean, the food is horrendous and the service is absent. If anyone rates the place as decent they are crazy or simple. No BS I hate Long John Silvers and this place is way worse. It's not homely like many southern fish joints, it's dirty and gross. I am from NC and have eaten at many disgusting fish camps and this place is beyond a joke. There is no hole in the wall appeal here. This place needs to be shutdown and those who continue to believe the reviews written by the restaurant are in for a terrible treat. I now have to go because my stomach is very upset from the dreadful salad bar."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years with my parents.  Last experience was the worst fish I've ever eaten.  The Manager told us to ask for the \"good\" fish the next time we returned.  I asked, \"as opposed to the bad fish\"?  She said the fish they were serving was from China and not the same fish we always had been served.  I asked for the \"good\" fish and was served plump, juicy, fresh catfish I've always enjoyed.  I'm not sure that we'll ever return."}
{"text":"I eat at this location at least 2-3 times a month. Penny is usually my server and she is great! I ate here last Thursday and had a server named Harold who was just HORRIBLE!!! We sat at the table for 20 minutes before Harold even showed up. We had to call on the manager to get Harold to show up. Once Harold showed up at our table, he was rude. He made feel as though we were bothering him. The manager John came back to our table and moved us to Penny's area. Penny was great as usual. John was very apologetic for Harold's behavior towards us. John is an A+ manager! We will continue to eat at this location. The food is always delicious."}
{"text":"I ate at The Hush Puppy at the Nellis location on 7-12-2014.  You need to check their site for when they are open.  Usually, after 5pm except Sundays (Noon).  I arrived a  little before 6pm on Saturday and the place had surprising more people than  I would have expected.  I was greeted cheerfully, immediately seated, after being asked my choice of table and area.  I was impressed with their friendliness and was given a menu, and the server returned immediately with a bowl of hush puppies and a sauce.  I ordered the $14.99 Platter that listed (4 to 5 small pieces) of alligator,(8 small on a stick) grilled shrimp,(6) fried clams, (2) fish fillets, and French fries (or baked potato).  I was told to help myself to the Salad Bar.  The plates were kept in a cooler and were  chilled.  The salad bar was small but more than adequate to make a salad.   I chose potato salad, pickled tomato's, a  lettuce/romaine combination, cherry tomato's, black olives, with 5 or 6 dressing options.  There were several other selections, but  my plate was full and I went to enjoyed my salad.  I ordered a draft beer and it came in a chilled mug and hit the spot.  Before I finished my beer, my order came. Everyone seemed to be getting their order about the same time and the server staff was busy.  I was ready for another beer when a man (the manager/owner ?) came around and ask if I needed anything and immediately returned with another chilled mug.  Several other customers also, were ready for drinks and it appeared that everyone had come about the same time and the servers were getting behind in refilling/getting drinks.  The alligator was not as seasoned as I would have liked and I was not impressed with it.  The fish was very good, cooked properly, crunchy on the outside and properly moist (I do not like undercooked fish) on the inside.  The fried clams made my dish.  They were very flavorful, crunchy and delicious.  I wish I had just ordered fried clams, they were excellent.  The fries were mediocre and could have been coated in a \"Cajun\" mix and would have helped the dish.  There was a lot of laughter in the restaurant, by customers and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  There was no music and it would have added to the atmosphere of the place.  All in all, I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Good foods , service  ! The restaurant need to be cleaner will be good ! Just eat at the one in Nellis !"}
{"text":"Food Not Bad...but wouldn't go back...There was lots of menu options depending on your preference...however my date was allergic to fish so that brought the options waaaay Down ...I'm not exactly sure which days they're open and I must not be the only one...because I was there on a Thursday early evening and it was a ghost town...our server was very attentive and kind...I liked how the salad bar had other salads like potato and Macaroni...but other than that Nothing to write home About"}
{"text":"This is on oldie, but a goodie. Has been in Vegas for many, many years and the restaurant has an authentic feel to it. The place is well maintained and the dining room was very clean. Service was fast and friendly. Penny always made sure we had enough hush puppies and honey butter, plus our drinks were filled as needed. The all you can eat catfish and shrimp was hot and crispy, but still tender on the inside. The salad bar had great macaroni salad. Great place for an interesting date."}
{"text":"I went here last year for my nephew's birthday party.The food wasn't as good as I've had there in the past.We had a large group in the private room,the service was very good.One of the waitresses came in and sang Happy Birthday and had an absolutely BEAUTIFUL voice! Really amazing! we all enjoyed that extra touch,we will be going again this year(my nephew is a creature of habit) hope the singer is there again."}
{"text":"Just a quick review of my dinner. Ordered 10oz chicken breast plate. The chicken tasted exactly like the pre cooked chicken you get in the bag, the one with the grill marks on it at the store that you buy next to the bolognie,ham and turkey. Rubbery and not seasoned good at all. Cocktail sauce, no good either. I lived in the south for 10 years, the hushpuppies were a good apptizer but i wouldnt call them hushpuppies. me and my fiance both left there with horrible stomach aches maybe the greese from the hushpuppys. I had 2 bites of the chicken. 2 stars because the baked potato was good. Waitress was friendly and removed the chicken plate from the bill. But won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Decent seafood for Las Vegas if you enjoy the southern version of a good fish fry - corneal battered.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Owned by Charlie and Virginia Gormley, this restaurant has been part of the fabric of Las Vegas since I was a young child.  Excellent food, supurb service and warm southern hospitality.  You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The catfish is always top notch.  And perfectly fried. Any day of the week you can do AYCE catfish and shrimp but really theres no need to  limit yourself here. While im sure those are their staples they also have frog legs and alligator tails and oysters (oh my!). They have the best hush puppies i've ever tasted and the honey butter is to die for!  They used to have AYCE crab legs but have since stopped which is ok, im a bigger fan of hot and juicy's crab legs anyways.  If you're looking for a quick fried seafood fiesta then stop  in.. You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"1st time here and it my birthday. Service was great and food was awesome. For sure will come back and try more. Heat job. So much to choose from will be coming back to try it all over time"}
{"text":"Great take out!! I wish I had time to go in and sit down. Love the freshwater catfish and the oysters."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple time because its the best catfish I have had and with an all you can eat specials menu. Friendly and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice staff and good food. However, it's mostly seafood and would expect more. Nevertheless this is a great place to eat some all you can eat catfish. That would be my choice of option."}
{"text":"Worst place I ever been no help . Literally none . Customer service zero . There's no way to contact the owner you have to contact the faulty staff first and leave a message which would never get to the owner . I used to go here often never again . Fuck hush puppies zero stars"}
{"text":"Kept hearing about The Hush Puppy for years from word of mouth mostly (they really don't do much advertising) and the wifey and I finally decided to pay a visit for a catfish fry!  Getting there is easy.  The parking lot for The Hush Puppy is HUGE!  Like you can park a church congregation huge.  My guess is on the busy days they really can pack the place!  That's a lot of fish and grease being consumed!  Interior of the restaurant is very eclectic with a mish-mash of design features which I can't place my hands on.  Some Native American hints here, some Asian inspired bamboo there, yet some Southern accents over there!  Restaurant is very spacious inside.  A large open dining room, what seems like another semi-outdoor dining space (?), and several smaller, more intimate rooms for families or smaller parties.    Wifey and I came for one thing on the menu - AYCE catfish, what The Hush Puppy is popular for!  Wait, it's gluten-free catfish!  Even better I suppose?  For $14.95 a person you can have unlimited servings of fried farm-raised catfish fillets, something they call fiddlers (small whole catfish), or fried shrimp.  You can combine two of these choices for the same price.  Or for $13.95 you can have fried freshwater fish fillets (which I assume is still catfish), if you don't want farm raised.  We had a hard time choosing two options, so our waitress was kind enough to let us sample their three most popular one - fried farm-raised catfish, fried freshwater fish, and fried shrimp.  How nice of her!  With your AYCE you get a main side of French fries.  For an additional $0.50 you can sub in a baked potato, crawfish rice, corn, or collard greens.  With each AYCE meal, the salad bar comes included.  Now this salad bar is by no means one you find at your local Sweet Tomatoes, it's more akin to one at Cici's Pizza.  It's tiny but it has most of the fixings you would find for a basic salad.  There is a gem or two there though.  That green tomato salad/relish at the salad bar?  Delish!  House made coleslaw?  Tasty!  Also at the salad bar don't forget to get a helping (or two) of the freshly made tartar sauce, very good and pairs well with your fried goodies!  Also with each meal, your table will get a basket of complimentary hush puppies.  These really are different though, they aren't the round kind you get from Long John Silver's.  Something special, more oval shaped, and very light on the inside.  Delicious with some of the included honey butter!  Beats a plain roll that's for sure.  Didn't take very long for our AYCE meals to arrive, maybe 20 minutes or so.  Fried items were nice and fresh!  Luckily, The Hush Puppy changes its oil frequently and you can tell.  Everything was golden brown, not greasy, and the light batter on the catfish and shrimp wasn't too heavy.  Farm-raised catfish fillet was great, very flavorful with their light cornmeal-based breading.  The freshwater catfish fillet was good too, milder in flavor but still tasty.  Both of these were excellent with a squeeze of fresh lemon, a dash of Tabasco, another dash of some malt vinegar, and a dip into tartar sauce!  The fried shrimp were probably our least favorite item on the AYCE, came out fried right but the breading was a tad heavy.  More shrimp please, less bread!  These almost seem like the kind you buy from your local big-box superstore, industrial packed and ready to cook.  Wifey managed to get to a second plate of AYCE goodness before she hit her wall.  I got to a third plate, but both of those contained only the fried farm-raised and freshwater catfish fillets.  I can imagine all the gluten I avoided during my meal.  I smite you Celiac disease!  Although I'm sure those French fries didn't help.  The Hush Puppy was overall pretty reasonable.  For the same price you can go to the Red Rock Casino buffet up the street on Charleston, and get a lot more bang for your buck.  The have the same fried shrimp I think!  And a much larger salad bar!  But for the AYCE catfish deal here at The Hush Puppy it's hard to beat.  I'll be back here again to sample their Southern goodness, we talked with the owner and he said to come back on Wednesday nights when for AYCE BBQ ribs, catfish, and shrimp for around $16.  It's a steal.  He also said next time we need to save some room for the fried green tomatoes and a slice of the house made Georgia pecan pie.  Damn, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  Y'all come back now, ya hear!"}
{"text":"Me to me: You did enough squats and deadlifts today. You can eat some fried food. Yeah!  Enter The Hush Puppy. I've had this spot bookmarked for a while and I finally made the trip there tonight for some drive thru goodness. I showed up around 5:20 p.m. and the parking lot was PACKED and the drive thru was about 6 cars deep. I was like \"alright now! Let's commit!\", so I chilled in my car for a while, inching my way towards the menu and order speaker. The drive thru takes time, so if you're in a hurry, do not use the drive thru, mkay? Mkay.   Ordering was easy and the voice on the other end of the speaker was friendly and helpful. I didn't feel rushed except for the truck behind me blinding me with its headlights. Drive thru life. Anyway! I ordered 2 pieces of farm raised cat fish. I didn't order a snack pack because I wasn't interested in the hush puppies or fries. I'm on a system with my body where I give it some bad stuff, but not ALL the bad stuff. Don't judge me. Anyway, 2 pieces of catfish, an order of seafood gumbo, an order of fried green tomatoes, and a slice of sweet potato pie. When I got up to the window, the lady was very nice and payment was quick. Got my food in a bag and I was out of there, trying to figure out how to get back to the freeway and home to eat.   The drive home was torture because it smelled so good in my car. Fried everything, seafood goodness. Get out of my way, Friday evening traffic. No really, get the f out of my way because I'm hungry! I laid everything out on my counter when I got home. Something wasn't packed right and the bottom of the bag was greasy but whatever. Taste test ahead!  So, the food. Here is where the experience fell short for me. I'm sad because I wanted to write a 5 star review, but sadly I cannot.   Catfish: Good but not great. The batter wasn't too thick, which was nice, and it stuck to the fish. The flavor just wasn't there. It felt almost under seasoned. I still ate it, of course, but I wasn't like \"OMG this is so awesome!\". It was ok. If someone brought it to me and was like \"Happy Friday! Here's some catfish\" I would eat it. It came with tartar sauce.   Fried green tomatoes: The tomatoes were lovely and tart but the batter was a bit thicker and it was falling off when I picked up the tomatoes. Also, some areas of the batter were too salty. I ended up removing one side of batter from the tomatoes since some areas were offensively salty. I had to drink a ton of water with these to feel like I wasn't going to bloat. The good part was the tomato relish sauce stuff that came with it. Really tasty. I used that instead of the tartar sauce for the fish.  Gumbo: Look, I love gumbo. I love it! I ate way too much in New Orleans but this one made me kind of sad for a couple of reasons. Although there was a lot of bits of seafood and some sausage, there was not enough spice to satisfy me and for $5 I just don't think it's worth it. It's a very small portion. I ate it all but I could have done without it altogether.   Sweet potato pie: This was the saving grace because the pie was delicious. I love sweet potato pie almost more than I love my husband. True story. I think the portion was a bit small for $4 but I can let that slide because it was good.   I don't know if I'll ever come back here. I can make a mean sweet potato pie at home and I'll be looking for other Southern fare in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the little hot hush puppies are sooo good. I dipped those things in some tarter sauce and you talking about good! OMG BOMB.. The fried catfish light and crisp on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside. The greens have a slight sweet taste but they are still good. The waitress that helped us was so sweet she explained everything on the menu. Also I really like how it's set up, it reminds me of down south."}
{"text":"I think this place is a little gem. The restaurant is not much to look at, but I think it's meant to remind you of going to your grandmother's house. When you walk in, it is like you stepped into 1978, the staff is super friendly, the portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable for what you get...but the prices are not cheap either. I enjoyed my food and the salad bar that came with it.   I think the French fries are all that and a bag of chips. I will be coming here again soon."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best catfish in Las Vegas.  You can eat in or go through the drive through although the menus vary a little.  There is more variety inside and you can eat the salad bar.  The catfish is battered in a cornmeal batter.  I recommend the fried oysters although on my latest visit I was a little disappointed that they price of (6) had gone from $3.99 to $4.99 I assume because of hurricanes, flooding, or drought.   I am happy to report that over the years they have greatly improved the fries and they are very good.  The fried shrimp is passable, but are breaded before begin frozen.  The hush puppies are always great although better when eating inside since I always forget to ask for a side of honey butter which is free inside, but  costs money for take-out.  Another reason to eat inside is you can get the all you can eat specials or the standard catfish deal.  Additional compliment:  Their fries have greatly improved over the years.  They used to be the worst, but now they are pretty awesome.  They are perhaps the best French fries in Las Vegas.  I like them better than any fast food fries."}
{"text":"There were plently of pleasant surprises on my first trip to The Hush Puppy yesterday. First of all, I didn't realize it was AYCE ribs night. Then when our waitress informed me that the AYCE rib special included shrimp and catfish. I was starting to complain to my wife that I didn't see hush puppies on the menu just about the time a basket of them arrived at our table with delicious honey butter (in lieu of bread). The ribs were tender and came right off the bone and the BBQ sauce was good too. The fried shrimp were okay. I rarely eat fish, but since it was included, I gave it a shot. It was actually pretty good. I liked the cornmeal batter and was genuinely shocked how much I enjoyed the catfish. The biggest surpise came with the check. Between my wife and I we had two entrees with sides, hush puppies, salad bar access, one non-alcoholic beverage, and two beers for just over $30.   Nothing is really spectacular here, but everything was good. I gave it 4 stars opposed to three because of the value. The ambiance and customer service matched my expectations of a place that charges around $10-$15 a person. The food and portion size exceeded those expectations hence the value. I would certainly recommend trying it out and I will likely go back myself.   The only thing that comes to mind as a negative about The Hush Puppy is that it doesn't open until 5:00 pm. For me personally, it is the type of establishment I would prefer to frequent for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Hush Puppy's for 20 plus years and not much has changed. For that reason I'll always be a loyal customer, even though they did away with the Monday night All you can eat Snow Crab Legs... Boooo!!!!    Most of the menu is fried seafood, they have a couple all you can eat options for shrimp and catfish. They start you off with a basket of fried hush puppies, cornmeal bread nuggets.. They come served hot with sides of honey butter.. If you wanna mix it up and be like a local, ask for the jalapeño hush puppies, they aren't on the menu so ask....   I come here for two reasons, Snow Crab or Catfish... Depending on my mood I'll either order their 2 1/2 pound Snow Crab legs, or the fried shrimp and catfish all you can eat special... They even offer an epic 1980's, throwback salad bar with every entree.. Trust me, you'll love it as long as you stick with what's good.."}
{"text":"Value, value, value! Ok, it's kind of silly to say that I've found a secret spot in Las Vegas in a restaurant that's been around 30+?? years, but that's exactly what The Hush Puppy is to me.  The GF brought me here as she loves crab. She ordered the 1+ pound crab legs while I ordered the gumbo. Best gumbo I've had in town. Sorry, Palace Station...yours was way too salty. The crab is good and the salad was ok. The pecan pie though was awesome!!  Wished the hush puppies had hot dog in them because I love corn dogs but the sweet butter goes well.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, remembered it being subpar but this time it was excellent! The crab was cooked perfect and my husband got ribs which were tender and fall off the bone good.  We really enjoyed it and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Amazing catfish fillets and hushpuppies :) I also love there fried green tomatoes :) Great place to go:)"}
{"text":"I ask, what's the hype with this place.  In my opinion  I see nothing to brag about. The food is less than mediocre. I tried the fried oysters, fried fish, alligator tail, grilled shrimp, hush puppies, salad bar, fried fish.. and let me tell you everything was just barely ok..   I will never return to this place. I disliked that I wasted my calories here.. disappointed. .  P.s the fried complimentary cornbread is actually your hush puppies. . U have to ask for the real hush puppies if you want the traditional seasoned ones. Otherwise you will receive the bland fried bread.    The service was just ok.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the steak, it was perfectly cooked and had no gristle.  Overall, the food was tasty, and the salad bar was pretty good, not great, but pretty good.  Also had all you could eat seafood, catfish was a bit thin, but still good.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Ok not amazing as promised. No seasoning on the fish nor shrimp. Salad bar was mediocre. Could use some upgrading. The best part was the sweet tea and collard greens (with lots of hot sauce)."}
{"text":"We were here last night me and my boyfriend enjoyed the all you can eat salad, baby back ribs, fried catfish, shrimp. Great food great service. Patty was amazing our server."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they are open late and have a drive thru. I was craving fried catfish and the first two places either closed early or had the wrong closing time. The food was tasty, much lighter than I was expecting. Somehow I loved the seasoned fries (I'm not a huge fries fan). The catfish was not over cooked, the hush puppies looked pretty and were sweet, the sweet tea was refreshing and the pecan pie was great to end the meal. I'll come here again next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Just got back from our first trip to the Hush Puppy.  First up - The building. I was ready for rustic. I was not ready for an overgrown weedy outside. Should have been a warning sign.  We were seated promptly. No waiting on Wednesday at around 5:30. Second warning sign.  Waitress was friendly and took our order promptly. And promptly forgot to bring our drinks until we were well into our trip to the salad bar. The salad bar was your basic out of a bag salad. Lettuce, potato salad, macaroni salad. Nothing super. They did have green onions....wilted green onions.  On to the main course - Hubby got the all you can eat shrimp and french fries. I got the Special which was all you can eat shrimp, ribs and catfish. The reason that they have all you can eat is that it is so bad you won't ask for seconds.  The shrimp was the flat kind with crunchy coating like you buy in the freezer section of your supermarket. You know the kind - the ones that are in layers with some type of wax paper between them - yes, the yucky kind. The ribs were plentiful and dry. The catfish tasted funny.   Few other comments -  Drinks were served in the big red plastic kind of glasses. Mine was cracked.  The tables are covered by a vinyl table cloth and then a piece of plexiglass. The plexiglass is very well worn. There is no money being spent here on upkeep.  This is one of those places that after you eat you wish you had not because it was just eating wasted calories."}
{"text":"My friend and i were in Vegas for Superbowl weekend and this place was recommended by a good friend of hers.  We arrived around 8:30 and it was a ghost town.   We said to each other, maybe this place isn't all that great.  NOT!!  They said it pretty much empty when there's basketball or football games on.  We ordered our Catfish with french fries and hush puppies.  The best catfish i've had in years.  Then i had a slice of sweet potato pie.  MMMM!!!!  it melted in my mouth.  We will definatly be going back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place yesterday to celebrate a birthday.  Let me tell you that it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The fish was horrible and the shrimp taste like it came straight from the freezer section of the local grocery store...actually that's giving them too much credit, because I've had frozen food from the market and it taste 110% better. Not only was the food inedible, but the entire restaurant had a strange smell...that should have been our first clue.  A couple of people in our group had the Gumbo and I wouldn't recommend that dish either.  My son had something as simple as a hamburger, and that was just barely edible. Everyone had stomach issues immediately after leaving the restaurant.  We are all from Los Angeles and have had our share of good fried fish all over LA, so we know good food. All I can say is don't do it, unless you like giving your money away. Let me make one thing clear, they are only receiving 1 star, because I don't believe have any other choice to select lower than 1."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go in jeans and sweats but you will get some hot and fresh fried fish. The farm raised catfish meal is all you can eat and tasty!   The salad bar is nice too and the pecan pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"I waited to try this place for a while, silly! A friend of mine told me that his family member makes it a point to stop by here when ever they visit Vegas, that was my que to finally go! Hush puppies serves up some delicious catfish! perfectly crispy, yet juicy. An order of catfish comes with fries, hush puppies, and cole slaw, tons of food for a VERY reasonable price. I've also tried the jambalaya and alligator tails. Jambalaya is small but hearty and the allegator tails I can skip on. The batter  was too thick for my taste...  The ambiance is pretty cute as well. Cozy with several dining areas and private rooms and a salad bar. Staff is very friendly AND there's a drive-though!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place for years. We finally decided to stop in. The food was great and service was beyond outstanding. It was well worth it just for the ambiance. They have great all you can eat specials.   I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how good the catfish snack box was. I'll definitely return when I need my fried fish fix."}
{"text":"AYCE is the best. Lov the Fiddlers, so moist, tasty & finger lickin good! Salad bar is simple, but has several choices. Lov it here. Big John (Mgr) visits tables & makes sure the customers are happy. Little John (waiter, is bar none) always makin sure we hav everything we want, (no lag time with him.) My out of town fam & guests, lov this place. Rib, oysters, gumbo, need I go on?"}
{"text":"Went in to order take out. The waiting area is nice and clean. The service was pleasant and quick. It was my first time there. The food was delicious. I ordered the Catfish Po-Boy, Catfish/Shrimp Combo, Seafood Gumbo and extra Hush Puppies (for two of us) and we had plenty of leftover! Food was still fresh when I got it home, not soggy like so many other fried take outs that sit in their containers. Crunchy, crispy and tasty. I don't do fried food often, but this is a nice indulgence."}
{"text":"Delicious pecan pie, ok salad bar,  pretty good round hash puppies. They have several non fish options, too."}
{"text":"a little inattentive forgot our fries & slaw but kept the crab legs coming-very friendly all-u-can-eat crab what more do you need!! hot-fresh & oh so tasty!! everything is good here!! didn't get any salad, fries or cole slaw any place that has all-u-can-eat crab is alright by me!! only $24.95 per person every monday night!! usually much better service"}
{"text":"Southern Home Cooking.  This place looks like a log cabin & feels like one too. It's usually jam packed but they also have a Drive-Thru.  Inside they have a salad bar with every meal and they have specialty all-you-can-eat nights with crab legs & BBQ ribs for under $20/pp.  It good for an occassional visit but it's a little much with everything but the salad being deep fried. My skin is oozing grease write now as I write this review.  The hushpuppies are hot & crispy but kinda flavorless unless you dip them in the honey butter. The fries are always cold but the GFT are fantastic and the whole reason I come here.  If your looking for some southern cooking and some odd stuff like frog legs and alligator tail this is your spot."}
{"text":"Located on Charleston Blvd. Dine in or go to the drive thru for ToGo orders. Plenty of parking for those that dine in, but can fill up quickly. Dinner time is especially busy and the drive through line can take some time to get through during this time.   If you are ever in the mood for catfish, this is one of the places to be in Vegas.   I typically order the farm raised family pack from the drive thru - it's always fried to perfection. Comes with fish, hush puppies, coleslaw, and French fries. Hence the name, The hush puppies are yummy.   Ive also indulged in their greens, fried oysters, and shrimp too. All good with me. I love the oysters.   Service in the drive through is fair. No complaints.   I think I'll have them for dinner this weekend."}
{"text":"My Father always told me if a parking lot is full and there is a wait, the food must be good. Boy am I glad that I listened to him because that is how we found Hush Puppy. Hush Puppy is so unexpected and so random and I love it! I must have driven by this place 20 times before I stopped in to try it out and it has turned out to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.   Monday Nights: All-You-Can-Eat Crab legs for $23.95 Wednesday: All-You-Can-Eat BBQ Ribs for $15.95 Every day: All-You-Can-Eat Catfish, Shrimp or both for $12.50  Where do I begin? This place is all around fantastic. I wouldn't say this is a Go-To Seafood joint, it is however a Go-To Southern restaurant. I have been on the All-You-Can-Eat Crab legs nights and the BBQ Ribs night but what I keep returning for is the catfish and amazing hush puppies. The catfish is perfectly cooked and seasoned. Most people think catfish is easy to make but the truth is, most people don't know what the heck they are doing when it comes to frying up good catfish. It needs to be cleaned perfectly, seasoned to perfection and fried crisp; this is exactly what you get from Hush Puppy. Just thinking about the finger lickin' catfish makes me so happy.  Did I mention how amazing the Hush puppies are? And they give you a side of honey butter to dip them in. This place is fantastic; everything I have eaten here is fantastic.   After you have eaten until you need to unbutton your pants, you might hear the most beautiful voice singing happy birthday. I am unsure of the server's name who sings but she is amazing, her voice is heavenly.   When I return to Vegas I don't head to Mesa Grill or over to Caesars to visit Guy Savoy, I check out Hush Puppy. Maybe I should start bringing Tupperware to fit more food in my purse, it is that good."}
{"text":"My hubby got some fried cat fish and he loved it. He got there almost close to closing and the staff were more than happy to still help him!"}
{"text":"As you might suspect The Hush Puppy on Nellis Blvd has been around for a LONG time. How can I attest to that fact? I vividly remember having a temper tantrum as a child (probably 5 years old) near the salad bar. Rolling around on the floor tantrum, as in my mother spanked me in public tantrum (hello 80s!). Anyway, I am now 27 years old and have been to The Hush Puppy on numerous occasions.   Basically this is a southern-style fish restaurant. A majority of the seafood (and alligator) are fried. Fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried catfish, etc. If you're looking for more of the \"grilled\" fresh from the sea type stuff you are going to the wrong place. I've tried just about everything here, but my faves are definitely the all you can eat crab legs, the catfish, and the clam strips. I friggin love clam strips, I don't know why, but I do. ALSO - don't forget the hush puppies here. I personally think they could use a bit more flavor, but when you put their sweet butter on them they turn into delectable little treats. The salad bar is meager at best, but I doubt you're really coming here to fill up on salad.  As for the ambiance - service can be hit or miss. I know I've come here with my family before and been just irritated with the lackluster service, but then other times when the service was great. Unfortunately I think that just comes with the territory of the place. It is not fine dining, so the servers are just going to be a draw for ya.  I assume some people would be turned off by the location, it is a bit desolate, but most of the time when the place is hopping the parking lot is full. It's old, yes. But it's a great place to get your fishy/southern munch on."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going here, don't hesitate just try it!!! I can't say enough positive things about the Hush Puppy. I've eaten here five times now and I can say my every dining experience I had was better than the first, even though I had nothing negative to say about my first time.  The AYCE seafeast on Thursdays are perfect for anyone who loves seafood. Fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried clam strips, fried oysters & chilled shrimp, hush puppies (the in-house made honey butter is perfect) + french fries. You can substitute the fries for a corn . *PRO TIP: the seafeast comes on one plate, a little of everything and about 3/4th of the plate with fries. Try not to finish the fries to leave room to order more seafood.  Also thank you John for your hospitality! He is so sweet and always makes each visit special.   I always make sure to stop by every time i'm in town. That's how amazing this place is :-)"}
{"text":"Been eating here for over ten years,And I can say that the all you can eat catfish has always been and taste the same year after year.The service is O.K. but the price is great,Nice place to get away from the strip to dine"}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant forever. The food is fantastic. Very southern and authentic. Great place to try alligator tail if you've never tried it. It is hit and miss though, and that's probably the worst thing I can say about the place because everything else I've tried on the menu is excellent. My favorites- the pickled tomatoes, the hush puppies, the catfish, the oysters. Excellent food. Excellent service. Plenty of space to park but it can get crowded. They have specials on different nights. This place has been a local favorite for over 40 years. They don't advertise because they don't have to."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving fish and decided on Hush Puppy's for our first time. We were blown away by how great the place is.  The atmosphere is comfortable and fun.  The staff, although they were very busy, were very attentive and friendly. The food was the star of the show. I tried fried green tomatoes for my first time and instantly fell in love. The catfish is hands down the best I've found in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Take out is a joke!  Took 3 phone calls and 15 minutes of being on hold to finally get my order in, which I was told would be ready in 10 minutes.  I showed up 15 minutes later and waited another 20 minutes before finally cancelling my order and asking for the manager.  Someone showed  up behind the cashier and started working the cash register.  Then the cashier said \"here you go\" and handed me my receipt and credit.  I asked where the manager was and the cashier said \"that's him\".  The guy who was working the register and refused to talk to me.  So I said to him, \" So, you are just going to ignore me and not deal with my problem with your restaurant\".  He just looked at me and didn't say a thing.  Totally unacceptable to have someone in charge who can't solve problems."}
{"text":"Experience:  This southern gal saw an article naming 21 places in Vegas that have been here for the long run that you need to eat at. This was on it and it was a southern joint, so I thought I'd check it out. I asked one of my friends to meet me at 5:00 since it says here on YELP that it doesn't open until 5:00.   Facility:  this is a pretty big place. It has kind of a lodge meets diner feel. Lots of wood paneling with diner kind of tables and chairs.  There were some pretty cool little cubbies with semi-private seating, and we noticed a fountain in the middle of the building that looked kinda cool. It's super casual though.  Service:  we came right at 5:00, but turns out they opened at 4:30. LOL!  We were sat immediately. Our waitress Penny was super friendly, helpful, and attentive. The manager came around to check on us and asked if we liked the food. He asked if it was our first time, which it was. He asked if we liked everything, and I said everything but the rice...then he offered a replacement for the rice. Now that is service! He even helped us out with getting a Togo box because our waitress was busy.   Food:  I was excited because they actually had Abita on the menu...that's a beer from Louisiana. So, I ordered one which was accompanied by a nice cold mug.  We tried the hush puppies which were good when you added the honey butter.  We also tried the coleslaw and potato salad off the salad bar. The potato salad I could tell was premade, but the coleslaw was homemade. I verified that with the waitress. Also, there was something a little different about the coleslaw. It was sweet, but there was a flavor not normally associated with coleslaw. I might be wrong, but my guess is garlic.  Then I ordered the \"Louisiana platter\" so I could taste a few things. I really liked the catfish. I think it as good as I might get in Nevada...Well at least what I've tasted so far. The oysters were breaded and cooked perfectly. The gator was good, but kinda bland. The shrimp was grilled, and it had a nice grilled flavor I really enjoyed.  I got the crawfish rice, which was pretty bland to me....wouldn't order that again. I also tried the greens. They were decent with some Tabasco added.   Overall:  The country in me liked this place. It was more of a 3.5 on my scale, but since the service was so good, I rounded up versus down.  I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"When in Vegas it's a must! I love love love their Fried Green Tomatoes and the Fried Catfish!!! And a slice of pecan pie and sweet potato pie to go!! Nellis location is my family's favorite!!"}
{"text":"The catfish here is usually pretty good. But today the catfish is really small and the batter is kind of bland so I have to put a lot of hot sauce."}
{"text":"After 28 years of frequenting Hush Puppy on Nellis, it's time to take to take this restaurant off the rotation. Tonight was by far the worst dinner served by this restaurant. Horrible tasing fish, watered down salad dressing and cocktail sauce, margarine instead of real butter pads has made this our last visit to Hush Puppy. Unfortunate the long time owner had chosen to compromise food quality instead of satisfying his customers. Profits will continue to decrease by losing long time customers like our family."}
{"text":"STOP AND GO ANYWHERE ELSE.   HERE IS THE REALITY FOR ANYONE WHO REALLY CARES  STAFF/SERVICE: That southern thing we all hear about. Relaxed, chill, nice. Unfortunately this transfers to slow, careless and \"sorry\". Waiter seemed burnt out on the job at hand.   FOOD:  Gumbo was good. Plenty of seafood in it to keep happy.  Green tomatoes were good. Same breading as \"bloomin onion\" at Outback.  Hush Puppies are still a mystery to me. Just a flavorless ball of flour-ey substance to soak up honey butter. Oil might have been a little old they cook them in.  Endless fried shrimp. If there was a product straight out of a freezer section this is it. Lot of oil on the breading.  My girls baked potato was served with \"bacon bits\" but this might be the standard down south.  Corn was the boiled type that sits in corn water for what seems like FOREVER and has that soggy mushy style that only denture wearers can admire.  \"Salad bar\" - sorry excuse for a salad bar. Everything was soaking in liquid. Felt liked canned everything. Watered olives, flavorless beets, sliced carrots. Again the feel of my final comment. Keep cutting costs hoping nobody notices.   Oysters are from the south. For ANYONE who cares these are the worst \"oysters\" if we even call them that to be served at any table at any restaurant. The truth is they are harvested in the nastiest water/mud/muck and then sent to a pasteurization process to kill any bacteria and also this kills the oyster. They are held closed after with a \"gold band\" since they are now dead. Go have a real shucked oyster from the west or east coast to really see what they should be. Nothing against this place but this is just a standard.   This is the epitome of likely yelp users.  They really have no clue on real food. This is a overpriced Long John Silvers with a good vibe to the restaurant. Amazed it has been around this long.   This is also a prime example of what restaurants do over time. Keep buying lesser products to save money to keep profits going as the consumers flee to much better places. I will say this was our first and last time and we didn't get to try maybe their better items but the chances of everything we didn't eat being incredible is impossible. I WANTED to be impressed. The parking lot had a lot of newer nicer cars. The style inside was great. It felt the part. I just don't know if this is horrible pass off as southern food or this is just what people are OK with receiving at a HIGH PRICE TAG in the least. Just no PASSION left from the owners. It's busy and people keep coming so they have no need to change it up."}
{"text":"love the fresh water fillets ask for extra crispy . Salad bar is just so fresh ,,,green tomato relish is  hush puppies heck it's all great . It's all fried . But they do have items on menu that aren't . Heck you can get that stuff everywhere . But if your from the south. This place is as original as it get and maybe better ."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my wife and I have dined here.  Boy, has this restaurant gone down the tubes.  My wife and I had the seafood feast $18.99.  The green tomato relish was spoiled.  The slaw was not not fresh.  The boiled shrimp was going bad. It had an odor.   The tiny oysters were all breading.   The tartar sauce has huge chunks of something in it that was unappetizing.  When we told our waitress about the relish, her reply was that she told the manager about the relish before, but his reply was that was how it was supposed to taste.  So sad.  We'll never go back."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, my experience was slightly disappointing. Although we were here on a Monday night (when they offer AYCE crab legs), I decided to go for the AYCE catfish fillets + shrimp. Some pieces of catfish were nice and moist on the inside due to their thickness. Others were not so flavorful. As for the shrimp, I should have known better. With some of them, if it wasn't for the shrimp tail, I questioned if there was even any shrimp in there.  I'm being harsh on the AYCE, but I'm still open to dining here again. They have other items I would like to try, such as their frog legs and their alligator dishes. But I wouldn't come back here for catfish, let alone AYCE catfish. I believe that Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips has better catfish. And as it turns out, they even do AYCE on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  As a final note, this place has the best hush puppies I've ever had. The thing is, I've never liked hush puppies. I don't get the appeal. So despite the fact that they are prepared flawlessly, I am still not a hush puppy lover."}
{"text":"OMG...I finally found some fried green tomatoes! They were DELISH! I had a shrimp po' boy as well...it was a delight. I'm a country gal, I'm from Alabama, and I've been n Vegas for 3 years...I've searched high and low for these two items...well today, I found them and I was thoroughly THOROUGHLY satisfied. The customer service was great as well....needless to say, I'LL BE BACK"}
{"text":"All you can eat catfish and shrimp for $13.95. They have super daily specials but I always end up getting the shrimp and catfish. When the alligator tail is in season, I love it, it has the chewy consistency of kalamari but the light flavor of a chickeny-fish. The fried tomatoes are great, very light and crisp. I really love this place, very laid back and chill, good southern food."}
{"text":"It was a waste of ayce.  The best thing was the fried corn meal.   I had to keep putting hot sauce on the fish because there was no flavor.  I won't try it again! I didn't even bother to go for seconds."}
{"text":"Great Southern Food!  Amazing Hush Puppies w/sweet cream!! The service was great.  The restaurant is clean. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Old School Southern Style Fare.. GREAT prices on all you can eat options. Catfish !! And a wonderful salad bar that is included. Try the shrimp and crab legs too. They have a \"rib\" night for you meat lovers. The Staff is awesome..Penny the waitress could not be better. The kids that host and seat are great as well as the owners and managers . Great food and super prices."}
{"text":"AYCE catfish!! How can you go wrong?! My family has been coming here for decades whenever we're in town.  The food is great and so is the service. When you order the catfish, you get unlimited access to the salad bar, which is well stocked with the typical salad, potato salad, etc."}
{"text":"Hush Puppies was good. The fish is well seasoned and lightly breaded. Not fried too hard at all.  We enjoyed the alligator too. Nice and moist. I took my time eating the delicious crab legs. Im niy a hush puppy person but I like theirs. This is definitely a spot we like to visit in Vegas and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We had planned to go to the Rio's Seafood Buffet however they were closed for remodeling until Mar 2008.  My brother recommended Hush Puppy.  We had the best all you can eat Crab legs you can get.  We had been to Alaska last year and the crab was just as sweet.  This place is  a large hole in the wall and  many of the local  people show up and eat here (good sign)  All you can eat catfish was also good and the price wasn't  high.  I will go again but check ahead of time see which day they will be serving the all you can eat crab.  Other fixings ok but you are going for the crab.  Ribs not that good but why order ribs here anyway.  My Mom had Salmon said it was light and good.  We went to the one on Carleston (15 minutes from strip). Also have drive thru."}
{"text":"Oh hell no !! Me and my nanny took my son into this lace one time That was enough for us.  It was very old and outdated  They served the grossest food like fried grouper and fried fish, nothing healthy at all  Everyone in there was like 200 pounds overweight.  My nanny will eat anything, and even HE was like \"this place is so rank\" We just laughed it off, paid the bill and left a good tip.   It looks like an old diner There's a drive thru.  The waitresses are nice tho. But food is. It my taste"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant. The food and service is only surpassed by the genuine hospitality of everyone we had the pleasure of coming in contact with during our visit.  It was our first time here, and we were blessed to have Ms. Debbie as our server. Mr. John and Ms. Francis came to our table to ask how we were doing and were absolutely the most sincere and kind people I've met in a very long time. All three of them gave us the most superb quality one-on-one attention and made our meal one we will never forget.  Everything was so delicious, from the farm raised fried catfish to the fried oysters to the seafood gumbo and even down to the homemade sweet potato pie that would rival Ms. Patti LaBelles ANYDAY!   MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT BY FAR. FIVE AMAZING STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!! We will definitely be back... soon!  Your new friends, NAIOMI AND JAMARR"}
{"text":"I don't have one bad thing to say! Best catfish I have ever had, ribs were fall off the bone delicious, hush puppies with honey butter I could not stop eating, and the cole slaw is great.... How many times can you say everything on your plate was fantastic? Then to top it off, super busy night in the dining room and the service was great, AND with smiles ...all genuine I might add! Our server was \"G\" I think Gia was her full name, and David one of the owners came to the table to chat with us and sincerely cared about our experience not that phony managerial stuff! Lastly was the bill, no over priced menu items here.. The whole experience was outstanding! We will definitely be loyal customers from now on, so glad we live near by!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for Snow Crab Legs..They did away with the AYCE but $20.99 is a good price for 13/4..My son loves crab legs and it was more than enough.. Great service too."}
{"text":"How can you wrong with all you can eat catfish? You have the option of fillet or whole catfish or both even shrimp. It was fresh and seasoned to perfection. Debbie was very nice and friendly. The salad bar could be better, but it was a good appetizers with the hush puppies. $14.95 is not a bad deal for seafood. I will come back to try the ribs. The alligator tails were great as well."}
{"text":"The whole office staff and I went to Hush Puppy for dinner. I had driven this restaurant plenty of times through the years but I always thought it was an oversized bar. It's actually an oversized restaurant, really big. They are so big they have 2 hosting stations.  This is a Southern style restaurant. Being a West Coast guy, I've not dared fray into the Southern states much (does Boston and New Orleans count?). It has an eclectic clientele from every walk of race coming here. So it must be good.  The food came piping hot and did not disappoint. Since they are well known for their catfish, we each ordered a basket of catfish. It is cooked just right with the right amount of batter and not over fried. The catfish was still moist and juicy inside. The fries are nicely crisp and plentiful. You get a basket. We ordered the raw oysters too and they were pretty fresh tasting, big and plump. Almost as good as the ones from Suncoast. Their salad bar was ok. It gets a bit sloppy after so many people go through it.  Service was brisk and quick but good.  I wanted to try the gator but I was stuffed. I shall try it next time for sure. It's been a long time since I had some in Florida.  FYI, dinner gets pretty busy so you may want to come a little early."}
{"text":"I am confused by all of the great reviews for Hush Puppy.. perhaps we came on a really off day?? This was a very disappointing meal. My husband who eats basically anything and doesn't complain kept going on about how mediocre it was. In my opinion, Long John Silvers would win an award if it were just these two in the running.. I'll start from the beginning... we received complimentary hush puppies with a side of butter. To say that I am a giant hush puppies fan would be an understatement. Any puppies I've had have been made from cornbread, these didn't even resemble the taste of cornbread..huge disappointment!! Then  we order drinks. They offer Pepsi products, sweet tea, beer, wine, and margaritas. Hmmm, no bar but margaritas, I'll give it a shot. I don't know what was in this, but it was garnished with a lemon and reminded me of the cheap stuff I could only afford when underage.. Two clues right off the bat.. My husband ordered a Mexican beer typically served with a lime..they only have lemons.. So our waitress, Dawn told us about the daily special...all you can eat ribs, catfish, and shrimp..with fries and salad bar for $18.95. Seems reasonable and based on the reviews, we're game! I opted to upgrade to a baked potato for 50 cents. So the salad bar is ok. It has very few salad toppings and only iceberg lettuce. I opted for the blue cheese dressing, after all I'm indulging, right? It was bland. Sad face. The best thing on the salad bar was the coleslaw and macaroni salad. We had a small snow crab appetizer that was decent. My husband ordered a cup of gumbo that did not resemble pics in other Yelp reviews. Typically gumbo contains sausage and a seafood..this has a shredded meat of unknown origin. He said it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't a true gumbo. So here comes our entree..the rib portion was three bones, two pieces of dry catfish (that was pretty fishy even for my hubby the fish lover..) and the four pieces of shrimp tasted like frozen food. I tried to camouflage the shrimp with their homemade cocktail sauce, even that was weird..it tasted like it may have been expired. I figured I could salvage the ribs with BBQ sauce from home..I asked for another rib and a to go box. The waitress said everything has to be eaten in the restaurant. I still had my entire baked potato, can't I at least have that? She made an exception this once since it was my first time. I would've given the 3 bones she just gave me back...it's not like I got six more of everything. There were a few loud mouth patrons in the same dining room I was in, this was annoying. Not the restaurants fault, but maybe they could seat like people in separate areas as there was an entirely additional dining room. Maybe seat families here, and ghetto swearing singles over there.?? So as I finish, I'm wondering should I really give even two stars? Yes! The waitress was on point and super friendly, the crab and macaroni salad was actually good. I'm just really bummed nothing else worked out cuz we need a good seafood joint to frequent. Oh well, moving on.."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice but the food was just okay.  I called in a take-out order for a fried shrimp dinner, shrimp gumbo, and alligator tail. When I arrived 30 minutes after my call, I was greeted by a friendly host. The restaurant had a very uninviting smell in the lobby waiting area, which I had to smell for about 30 minutes because my food was not ready.  As for the food, the fried shrimp tasted very bland and there was too much breading.  The fries and hush puppies that came with the meal were okay, nothing to call home about. It was my first time trying alligator tail, and surprisingly this tasted pretty good. I didn't attempt to eat the shrimp gumbo. I wanted to avoid further disappointment.  Overall, the staff was great, the food was decently priced, but the taste was just okay. I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"I loved the food!! Great catfish that needed no sauce, wonderful fries and hush puppies!!"}
{"text":"I am normally not a negative critic of food and I understand places have good and subpar days, but this experience was worse than bad.  Family from Louisiana and Texas hugely disappointed in the food! We dined around 8. Hush puppy logs were gummy, unseasoned and greasy. Fried green tomatoes were ok but again no seasoning. One of us asked for grilled or blackened catfish as a healthier alternative but it's not an option BUT GRILLED SHRIMP ARE AVAILABLE? The catfish must be bought pre-battered and they must cook it in large batches and sat under a heat lamp for hours. The catfish was HARD AS A ROCK, dried out, over cooked, batter crumbling everywhere. We hid a few pieces in the crab shell bucket hoping the next round would be better but sadly it was just as disappointing. Maybe it would have been edible if we had gone earlier? We finally had to ask for fresh fish and received 2 pieces soft enough to eat. They only have tabasco or red hot sauce? Louisiana hot sauce is the only way to go  for fish n greens and I love me some greens BUT the 3 of us that ordered them quickly found that they tasted days old and funky like they had been reheated many times. Snow crab was ok, bland, nothing to brag about. One of us ordered frog legs and the grilled shrimp combo and he was the only one in our party of 5 that enjoyed his meal. Our waitress was very nice but overall experience made the check over $100 seem like such a waste.   A sprinkle of Tony's, some Louisiana hot sauce and fish cooked to order would be an improvement. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"From the outside it appears to be nothing to write home about - but once you enter you're in for one huge surprise.  We were pleasantly greeted upon entering and quickly seated.  I honestly couldn't tell you what was on the menu because as soon as I read 'All You Can Eat Catfish', I was instantly sold!  The catfish literally just melts in your mouth.  I had the combo catfish & shrimp.  The shrimp was just as good - no heavy breading and even though it was fried, it was far from greasy.  Our waitress was on top of things - never once did we have to wait for drink refills.  The food was delicious.   I strongly recommend trying their Greens - there is no word to properly describe how mouth watering they are.  And finally ... the never ending hushpuppies ... OMG ... amazing is all I can say!  If you're hungry for some off-the-chain catfish - then you MUST give Hush Puppy's a try!"}
{"text":"I gotta say this...I never expected to find good Southern Cookin in Vegas...I mean of all places....Vegas?? My friend suggested we go...so we went on a Friday night...after drooling over the menu for a good 10 minutes.....we finally decided to try out the Steak, Crab legs, Catfish, fried shrimp, greens, fried oysters, fried clams....and that Gumbo!  That gumbo was the truth! My friend ordered the gumbo to share...so you know how you grab a few spoonfuls to try it but you cant stop...but you really want to so you dont look greedy? Yeah...I was feeling that way even after she offered me the last piece of shrimp in the gumbo. :) Everything else was pretty damn good but the gumbo was the best part of the meal. 2 bowls of that and I wouldve been satisfied.  The location is a bit far from the strip but....it was wellllll worth the trip. But check this out...they even have a drive thru! Hush Puppy owners? Dont you wanna expand to the east coast..preferably in the northern va area near the white house....i swear you would make so much money!"}
{"text":"I am from Louisiana and saying this is Louisiana food is a joke. They must have never heard of creole seasoning. I had the Pan-seared Louisiana Shrimp. Most of the shell was left on the shrimp and the seasoning was not good at all. The menu said it comes with corn coblettes and I got fried green tomatoes. I questioned that and the waitress said it was because you get the corn when the tomatoes are out of season.    The only thing good about this place is the people that work there."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Monday's all you can eat crab legs for $25! and they have really great bbq."}
{"text":"Been a patron of this restaurant for decades.   Always good service and yummy food.  It's like taking the best of the Southern seafood cuisine to Vegas.  I inquired about more drive thru menu options and was told I could call in advance  any \"take out\" item from the menu  and request to pick it up through drive through.   I haven't done that yet,  so I can't verify it will be done."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful talk about comfort food it has it all atmosphere great food wonderful waitstaff kudos to our Penny who took good care of us the other night we loved our food we loved our waitress we love it within walking distance of our house!! All need to go and enjoy all at this restaurant has to offer. their dessert their main courses their prices best restaurant ever"}
{"text":"First Time here and the food, staff was awesome. Manager came over and gave us samples of the fried catfish, super nice."}
{"text":"I had the all you can eat catfish with a side of baked potato. The salad bar was not bad, could be a little bigger in terms of variety but it had romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, etc.   I did love the catfish! The server was very attentive and friendly. Great service. While you wait for your order, they so serve a batch of hush puppies - delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice fresh fish and excellent dinner experience . Managers always smile around tables  Very professional"}
{"text":"Dropped to a 2, as they are not doing all you can crab for a couple months. I don't see any other reason to go to this Hush Puppies, so they dropped from a 4.5 to a very generous 2."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over 20 years but decided to take my boyfriend here and he absolutely loved it.  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient and the owner/manager(?) stopped by several times to see how we were doing. Our table had a pleasant view of their outdoor waterfall which was especially nice because it was pouring rain and made for a very nice view.  We both chose the all you can eat ($15) catfish/shrimp selection which included the salad bar and a basket of Hush Puppies.  We started with an appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes which were excellent, hot & crispy.  Then we had the whole Catfish and the Freshwater Catfish which were both excellent.  The fish was very light and melts in your mouth like butter.  The Collard Greens and the Corn on the cob were also very good.  The salad bar was just okay... nothing special there.  I'm sure on one of our next trips to Las Vegas we'll be back here again for some more delicious catfish."}
{"text":"This place will always hold a special place in my heart because it's one of the first restaurants my parents took me to when we moved to Vegas in 1987. In all these years it hasn't changed and it totally does not need to.  Hush Puppy's has some great southern food. They specialize in AYCE Catfish, Fried Shrimp Crab legs and so much more. They do daily specials as well.   When I arrived my Dad had already gotten us a table and there were Hush Puppies waiting for me at the table.  Pro-tip: Don't fill up on the Hush Puppies. They tend to expand and fill you up faster.   I knew I wanted the AYCE Shrimp and my dad wanted the AYCE Shrimp and Catfish. It comes with their salad bar which is really small, but I think it has the perfect amount of items. I'm a huge coleslaw snob and Hush Puppy's has the perfect recipe. It isn't packed with sugar. They also have pickle spears and a yummy tarter sauce.   Our Shrimp and Catfish came out fast. The Shrimp were huge and perfectly crisp. Yum! The food tasted just as good as it did before. The staff is excellent. Our waitress kept the Shrimp and Catfish flowing and was on point as far as drinks were concerned.   By the end of the meal we were so full. But Hush Puppy's did not disappoint. The meal was just what I wanted. It hasn't changed in all these years and that's part of the charm for me. Not to mention they do have some seriously tasty seafood. If you feel like filling up on some tasty bites make sure you check out Hush Puppy's."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to this place last night. First greeting was cold when you walked in, and secondly the waitress was ok but not one that was of server experience. We went because we were told it was good food , so we thought we try it. MISTAKE.  Thirdly, when we ordered and got our food, the waitress brought my plate and ALL the food slide off the plate onto the table. WOW Really. She got me new fries, but what about replacing my ENTIRE MEAL as the ENTIRE MEAL fell off the plate on the table. I asked for sauce for my meat, and was told to go to salad bar and get it there. REALLY. I am playing for this meal and I gotta get up and get my own . Wow I should have went to an BUFFET where you are suppose to serve yourself, and not a restaurant, NO THANKS TO THIS PLACE EVER."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that I eat here ALL THE TIME and have never had a bad meal. However, some menu items are better than others, in my opinion.  So you're probably wondering about the catfish. I love it. I love it to the point that my (seafood fanatic) husband couldn't touch another piece of fried fish for six months after I made him eat catfish for dinner daily for two weeks. Luckily he's over his aversion, as we went through the (highly convenient) drive-thru just the other day! I won't say this is the end-all, best catfish in the world, but it's in my top two or three.  The ribs are really good too. I'm usually cautious about ordering ribs because I am very picky about them. My usual fears are unfounded, as The Hush Puppy prepares them just the way I like them: crispy/charred on the outside, falling off the bone and not sauced to death. I take it a step further by ordering their (excellent, btw) barbeque sauce on the side rather than slathered on the ribs themselves. The Wednesday (and Saturday too, at the Nellis location) AYCE rib special comes with catfish, fried shrimp and probably some other stuff I cannot recall. I think one time I was able to eat judicially enough to be able to order a second plate of the ribs, but AYCE for me these days translates to \"damn, not nearly enough!\"...  For those of us not wanting to die of a heart attack on the way out of the restaurant, I can recommend a couple of \"lighter\" options. The crab legs platter is ridiculously cheap and B-I-G. There's also a combo plate featuring only grilled items: \"Cajun Fantasy\". It comes with a blackened catfish fillet, a skewer of grilled shrimp and stuffed oysters, if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely not a heavy dinner and is the only thing I've ever ordered that I am able to finish.   The basket of bullet-shaped hush puppies brought to the table shortly after sitting down is always solid. I like them with or without the honey butter, but c'mon, what WOULDN'T be made better by honey butter? I've always been accustomed to more savory hush puppies, usually with onion inside. This is an interesting change.  There's a small salad and condiment bar offering up a good chow chow (which I will put in and on nearly everything on my plate), tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, some typical salad items/dressings, coleslaw, potato/macaroni salads and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. I usually make myself a little salad, take a spoonful or two of the mayo-based stuff and get my condiments before dinner. I was initially taken aback by the fact that you get your own sauces, but I quickly realized that for a sauce-Nazi such as myself, it's a blessing. I've always found the salad bar area clean and with fresh items, personally.  The restaurant itself is rather oddly decorated and has many different rooms/corridors. Half the time I get lost on my way to and from the salad bar. That's okay though, and I think it would be a brillant place for a large group, since many of the \"rooms\" have just a couple of tables. More often than not, I hit up the drive-thru, though the drive-thru's menu is limited. Great value, whether or not you eat inside, and you can feel good about supporting a long-standing local eatery!"}
{"text":"Being from the southeast, we are always looking for good southern food joints in Vegas. The Hush Puppy is a fantastic example and a great place to eat. When you are inside it reminds me of the coastal seafood joints we went to when we would visit Murrel's Inlet near Myrtle Beach, SC. They have an all you can eat seafood option. They also have a salad bar which comes with most meals. Definitely worth a visit, and we plan to return very soon."}
{"text":"Hush puppy! I haven't been here for years and I got to finally come back today! There is a unlimited salad bar with awesome macaroni, coslaw, and potato salad bar. We ordered the oysters, ribs, and all you can eat catfish/shrimp. Our waitess was so attentive and friendly we absolutely loved her! The ribs are a must have with the crawfish rice. The catfish/fried shrimp are blah I would not recommend it or get it ever again. The oysters were amazing I wish I could've eaten more but I would've been poor. And lastly, I was so excited to order hush puppies and they were freeee!!!!!!! that totally made my night! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The BF and I got into a random tangent about seafood and thus got into that we havent had catfish in a long time.   I love the crunchy cornmeal batter and appreciate that this is fresh,clean tasting catfish and the shrimps are mild and sweet. This time in the salad bar there's pickled green tomato and it's great with the catfish some hotsauce and lemon. A little citrus, a little spice, a little sweet= perfecto. I got some collard greens as my side and they were decent. It's very straightforward food but it's quality. I can never really eat much, but worth it enough to do AYCE since it's only $12.50  Service is always friendly and pretty attentive even though it can be pretty busy. Sure sometimes they might forget your extra honey butter or something or to bring you hot sauce, but not intentionally and bring it up right away if you remind them.  For how busy it is and how many tops they're caring for, it's not that often. Drinks are filled at a decent rate too, didn't wait too long on empty.Our server today for example, was also the cashier so all things considering I appreciate how much each person does here and still manage to do it with a smile and hospitality.    I overheard someone sitting behind me saying their oysters here are great so I got something new to try for next time."}
{"text":"First of all Dawn is the damn MVP!!!!! I absolutely LOVE her. She's the best server I've experienced in a long time. Secondly, I don't even eat typical seafood but I had the tilapia and it was so delicious!!! The frikken hushpuppies were the death of me along with the sweet tea! Yaaasss!!! Did I mention how amazing the honey butter and ranch is?? Thank you Dawn"}
{"text":"AWESOME hushpuppies, and for a hole in the wall type place, their food is GOOOOOD. It's hot, fresh, nice service and they don't have thick breading on their catfish, it's coated just right.  I am not a fan of fried shrimp and asked if I could substitute extra fried oysters and they did with no problem at all.  I've always liked this place and will continue to go back anytime :-)"}
{"text":"DRIVE THRU customer service was horrible. We stopped in on Halloween, the only customers in line and it seemed like we interrupted the guy at the window text messaging session. He was extremely rude and didnt give any condiments or plasticware. When you have customers that come there all the time, you would think that the service in drive thru would be as welcoming as going inside... we spent 60 bucks and got all attitude..."}
{"text":"We love this place the catfish is good the hush puppies with that honey butter are awesome the french fries the gumbo what else is good there the alligator tail mostly everything on the menu. I guess the only bad thing I can say is sometimes it's like a 20 minute wait in the drive-through but it's well worth it when your food is hot Because tonight I got to go home and warm it up it's not hot enough, Even though they're still open for another hour that was a bummer"}
{"text":"I am sick of people saying this place doesn't have \"real\" hushpuppies.  Hushpuppies were originally simple balls of fried cornmeal thrown to dogs to shut them up. So I would say that heavily seasoned ones with chopped onions in the batter aren't real hushpuppies. The hushpuppies here are simple and delicious, especially with honey butter or tartar sauce.  This place has great catfish, and I am a big fan of the AYCE crab Mondays. They don't always make it obvious, but if you get the AYCE crab, you are also welcome to AYCE catfish, shrimp and french fries (it makes sense, since each of those is cheaper for them than the crab--EDIT: apparently they changed this; it's now a couple bucks extra).  Unfortunately, this place is often pretty dingy, and the busyness tends to keep the staff from being very attentive.  I've been going to this place for almost 20 years now, and I highly recommend it. Just don't whine about not being able to take food home if you get AYCE. It's a common policy and it certainly doesn't deserve the type of nasty reviews such as the one from last October."}
{"text":"Gumbo was super salty, shrimp Po Boy nothing special. 1st Time there, disappointed, won't be back. Service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent service tonight!  The manager even checked on our table. The food was good and the one food item I tried and didn't like the waitress took off of our bill. It was a pleasant night out for dinner. Good for you Hush Puppy. It seems like bad service is the norm now a days so we appreciate good service and an attentive waitress when we finally get it.  The price for our dinner was amazing to!  You can't beat good food , good service and a great price!  We will be back."}
{"text":"We visited Hush Puppy again this weekend with my family.  It is one of their favorites when they visit us.  The salad bar seems quite a bit better than last time (better quality lettuce, etc.).  I tried raw oysters for the first time here, and they were very good!"}
{"text":"I really really wasn't impressed with this place.  I felt like the salad bar was mediocre at best. The catfish and shrimp were dry and bland.  It was pretty expensive as well.  I felt like you could eat a better meal at Long John Silvers."}
{"text":"I'm a generous star giver, even if I'm not too satisfied or blown away- so this review will be confusing.   Came for the chow-chow, left disappointed. Food was okay, not as great as the hype made it seem. Trying it once was good! I always say try everything once :)"}
{"text":"Excuse the delay on this review and photos. These photos of food are from 3/2016 visit. Pleased to tell you when I went 12/2016 and 3/2017 the quality is the same. The food is fresh, the place is clean, something good to eat for everyone. The food is great.  I all you can eat Catfish filet. The catfish is sweet.Its a must stop every time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant. I don't care who you are or where you're from, this is solid southern food. Portions are large and the all you can eat options are fantaatic. I always get the fried catfish combo and it fills me to the brim. Best thing has to.be the hush puppies. They are just mouth watering and delicious and the right bit of everything and the butter to dip it in. Hmm I nearly just had a foodgasm thinking about it. Highly recommend you come here for dinner. Make sure to check the specials for each night."}
{"text":"Hush Puppies is a nice Community seafood restaurant that offers a variety of seafood options such as shrimp, catfish, crab, Etc. they also offer a small salad bar and unlimited hush puppies that you can eat while your food is being prepared. Can't say hush puppies is the best seafood restaurant in Las Vegas but if you don't want to go to the strip or go to Red Lobster or head over to the west side for some ala carte fish then hush puppies is the place to go."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's decent quality food.  As someone who prefers to lean on the positive, that's the best I can muster.   If I want basic fried fish n chips with a good tartar sauce, this is the place to be.  If I want Cajun/southern/soul food, I'm going somewhere else.  They'll get one more try from me before I totally write them off, but for a place named for their hush puppies, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"The Hush Puppy has a sad looking dog on the front of their restaurant which I think is appropriate, I felt like that puppy looks when I left the restaurant last night. I met my girlfriend and her mom there for mom's birthday last night (Happy Birthday!!) as they like the Thursday night all you can eat seafood special. I've been suspicious of the Hush Puppy for several reasons, shady area, \"southern food\" in Nevada, and most telling a never quite full parking lot when I go by. Still I gave it a shot because there are plausible reasons why a good or even great restaurant my experience any one if not all of these things. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I saw it last night.   The restaurant it's self has been at this location for many years and it's age is showing; faded paint, outdated fixtures and furniture, it almost had a depressing feel to be honest.   We waited a few minutes at the register as there was no hostess or sign inviting us to seat ourselves. Not a big deal but as the place wasn't that busy I questioned why we had to wait at all. We placed a drink order straight away and were told to help ourselves to the salad bar and hush puppies at the table. The salad bar was marginal at best, few topping options and the cherry tomato's were a bit old but not too bad. I did like the coleslaw. The hush puppies at the table were not at all what I had expected, about the size of a my little finger and oval in shape they had no flavor and I quickly put them to the side; I've had some delightful hush puppies in the past with chopped onions and seasoning.   Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long for our meal to arrive, the all you can eat seafood included fried butterfly shrimp, cocktail shrimp, clam strips, deep fried oysters, and fried catfish (really seafood?) with a side of french fries I nibbled but left to the side as to focus on the seafood. With the exception of the clam strips which I found tough and gamy I liked everything on the plate. While surprised having catfish in a seafood special it was good, I liked the butterfly shrimp the best. The food as definitely the best part of my experience which is why I gave it two stars.   I was very disappointed at the service, there were maybe four tables in our section, not an overwhelming prospect for a waitress I would think yet ours spent more time in the kitchen. My water was empty shortly after our plates arrived and I didn't get a refill for nearly 10 minutes, unacceptable.   If you must have \"southern cooking\" in Las Vegas and have nowhere else to go I suppose you could give them a try as other guests have given favorable reviews but I wouldn't recommend it. I certainly won't be going back on my own."}
{"text":"My wife was craving fried catfish, well we found the best place in Las Vegas! The service was great, with our waitress Pam very pleasant explaining the menu and offering suggestions. The manager John came by the table to say hello and asking how things were. Well...The salad bar was very fresh and well stocked, the hush puppies were fresh and hot, the catfish was delicious. My wife had the fillets, I had the whole catfish they were both delicious, fresh, hot and flavorful! John cam by again and offer me a slice of sweet potato pie Ala mode! Oh goodness just like my aunt made back home!! We will definitely return soon and bring more family! I recommend to everyone to come check out the Hush Puppy!"}
{"text":"We have been here to this location several times. I felt compelled to review tonight's visit due to the dismissive service and lack luster food.  First, the hush puppies are abysmal. Absolutely no flavor, no green peppers or green onions or jalapenos at all. Just fried, non seasoned corn meal. Possibly frozen.  The fresh water catfish was surprisingly good but not as good as before since they changed the fish ( still scratching my head at that decision).No swampy or muddy taste, but not thin like before.Crunchy and favorable. The highlight of the meal. But I did have to add red rooster hot sauce to give it a little kick.  We tried the alligator for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Very mild tasting.  The fried shrimp is basic and probably fried out of a box.  The collard greens were disappointing.  You have to take the time to cut them off the stalk!!! Otherwise you feel like you're chewing on bamboo! Also , greens were waay too sweet!!  The kicker for us was when we asked the hostess if the fish tasted swampy or muddy (which is a well understood term in the South) instead of saying something like \" I don't know, let me find someone who can answer that\" she brushed us off saying \" I don't know,  I just work here.\" Um, we know you work here,  that's why we asked YOU!!  My hubby's family is from New Orleans and we were just there a few months ago. Trust me, these people do NOT know authentic Southern cuisine and don't seem like they care to learn."}
{"text":"Very good southern food here. Had the All-You-Can-Eat Catfish and Shrimp, and it was delicious. The salad bar was well stocked, and of course the hush puppies were tasty. The sweet tea is by far the best in Las Vegas (it is real sweet tea, not the stuff you normally get)."}
{"text":"A must stop for every time I go to Vegas. They have well great food, hushpuppys a course are the best anywhere,and seafood is great too. I do the buffet or whatever one it is where they keep sending food & hushpuppys and always feel like I got full too fast!"}
{"text":"Ok...we moved to Eastside vegas and kept passing this place...I read up on it and wanted to give them a try...all I have to say is I am SO glad we did. You walk in and it takes you back to what I would think an old bayou restaurant would look like...the greeter was very friendly and sat us right away. But before that we met a very friendly elderly couple in the parking lot...told us how good it was there and invited us to their church. :) back to the inside...we then met our waitress ...who was very pleasant and helpful. I ordered the crab legs dinner with salad bar and a baked potatoe...my man ordered the all you can eat fried shrimp and catfish with salad bar and greens. He said it was the best greens he has EVER had at a restaurant...his catfish was cooked to perfection...now to me...the crab legs were a huge generous portion and the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! I have had a lot of crab legs in my life, none as good as these. They were cooked perfectly to where you pulled out the meat in one chunk, it was not over cooked to where it became mush.  The salad bar was good. Very good Bleu cheese dressing. The tartar sauce was so good. Definitely tasted homemade.  Made us want to go back again and again...my man said he has never seen me so happy as I was every time I opened a perfect piece of crab! ;) then we went back last night! Haha...told you we would be back...this time I had the Louisiana shrimp...wow...perfectly seasoned with Cajun spices. Again had the salad bar and a baked potatoe..my man had the half rack of ribs and catfish, again with greens and salad bar. They give you a basket of hush puppies and honey butter to start and the story of the Hush puppy made me laugh...I will post for you to enjoy...I tried to get good pics but my fiance ate his so quick it was hard... :)  We are so glad they are right down the street from us...we will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Hush Puppies because my mom recommended it. My mom really don't like to many restaurants so we had to try it! It's really easy to get to and the parking area is HUGE! We were greeted by a really nice gentleman and seated immediately.   I ordered the AYCE special (catfish, shrimp and ribs) and my husband had the Seafood platter which they allowed him to substitute the fried oysters for Raw oysters which he truly appreciated. The complimentary hush puppies were DELICIOUS!!! Make sure you treat yourself to  the sweet tea...you will not be disappointed!!!  Our waitress named Penny was the best. Thanks Penny for making our first experience a great one!!!"}
{"text":"Just went for dinner, excellent food, great prices, and by far the best service I've had while living in Vegas. I loved it there!"}
{"text":"Weve been eating here for 20 yrs, but after a absence of 2 yrs. i must say them like most restaurants in lv they are pticing themselves out of the workingmans bussiness nothing on the menu was less than 15.00.The quantity & quality is the same as when it was half as much. We enjoyed it but cant afford it anymore."}
{"text":"This might end up being a long review...who knows. We went to Hush Puppy today for mothers day. It was a party of 6 and it was first come first serve. The wait was about an hour and 20 minutes because there were quite a few parties over 15 people before us. When we got called back they sat us at the back right of the restaurant. With a party of 16 another party of 6 and a table of at least 4 that I saw at a glance including us (making it another 6). That's a total of 32 people at the very LEAST. Tell me why these people had 1 lonely waitress waiting on 32 people by HERSELF?!?! Our waitresses name was Davita (pardon the spelling) and she was AMAZING. She walked up to us within 5 minutes and apologized for how busy they were but she promised she'd be right back. She took about 5 to 10 to get back to us where she took our drink orders and our entire food order because she wanted to make sure everyone was helped and got what they wanted. Now I've worked in the restaurant industry before at a fast paced strip restaurant and this woman was doing 3 to 4 peoples jobs at once! She was the one fetching ALL the drinks and I mean soda,sweet tea to making the margaritas herself and bringing them all out. She made sure multiple baskets of piping hot hush puppies got to our tables...she was bussing the tables... refilled out drinks at least 3 times in the hour and a half we were eating INCLUDING multiple beers and mixed drinks. She brought us oysters and checked on us multiple times. ***MIND YOU SHES DOING THIS WHILE SHES TENDING TO A PARTY OF 16 AS WELL AT THIS POINT*** the woman never stopped moving ... the owner or whatever he is just walked around and didnt ever stop to ask the tables how they were doing or how the food was food them but ya know DAVITA did. I can say the party of 16 had some words with him about how the food was cold and they should have had more help for that waitress busting her butt...and I guess he decided quality control wasnt important because he booked it and sent a younger girl out to try and handle the situation. The party of 16 told it exactly how it was... Davita busted her ass and they wanted to make sure all that money they got charged for gratuity was going to her 100% for her hard work on a popular holiday of all days. They made it a point that no one else came in and worked the way she was working and that she shouldn't have to give anyone a cent from those tips she was getting. They also addressed the cleanliness of the bathrooms...which were definitely dirty and needed to be tended to. ANY restaurant should know that a clean bathroom is important for patrons and the staff. c'mon people.  Addressing the food....for my table it was hot when it hit the table...we got the Bayou Platter and it was really good! The alligator was delicious and the catfish was perfect. The sweet tea was also pretty spot on as well as the margaritas Davita made for me while doing everyone else's jobs. ***you go girl!!!*** needless to say we tipped her well and we walked it over to her as we walked out to make sure she got it and she thanked me and my boyfriend with hugs. Now I dont know if this woman gets any credit for the hard work she puts in but she is who should be running this place NOT anyone else. Giving credit where credit is due... the woman busted her butt to make sure her customers got quality service and the cooks had to have been busting their butts too. But the rest of the staff? I've seen snails move faster. 4 stars for food and my waitress ONLY. The rest of this place gets a 1."}
{"text":"I've routinely visited this location whenever I've visited Vegas, but I'm seriously thinking I won't return.   My last visit -last week- found poor service and poorer quality of food. After being seated the waitress took our drink order and didn't return for almost ten minutes, and only because we asked the hostess for help.   I ordered the AYCE catfish and can honestly say the fish was awful!    The texture of the fish was dry and crumbly, no moistness anywhere. It seems to me they've taken catfish fillets, cut them in half then deep fried until every piece of that fish becomes dusty crumbs.   My niece had the boiled shrimp which didn't disappoint, but I can get shrimp anywhere. I wanted my catfish and I wanted it to be edible and tasty. Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the look of the place fool you.  The Hush Puppy has good southern food, offering some items that you won't find much of in the valley--such as alligator.  The atmosphere is very casual, certainly perfect for a family with kids.  The waitress was good; we did go a bit without seeing her at one point, but nothing enough to get us upset.  The food was really, really good.    Appetizers:  First, we started with a bowl of gumbo, and it was fantastic.  My daughter ended up ordering another bowl as her main course.  The hushpuppies, which came with our meals, were good.  My wife liked them more than I; but I must say the sweet butter it comes with really enhances the flavor.  We also had the salad bar, which was very basic overall---and no complaints from us.   Entrees:  My wife had the crab legs, which made her happy.  My son ordered the endless fried shrimp, and had the wharf combo--alligator & frog legs w/ greens.  Personally, I was happy with everything.  The batter they used didn't take away from the flavor of the actual food; the same went for the shrimp.    So that's (for 4 people) - 2 bowls of gumbo, 3 salad bars, hush puppies for all. endless shimp w/ fries, over a LB of snow crabs w/ fries, alligator/frog legs combo w/ collard greens, and 4 drinks for under $80.  How can you go wrong w/ that?  And if you want to pick food up on your way home from work, they have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased last week. I have been here many times 8 years plus ago and loved the frog legs and alligator, but not the fried oysters as to crunchy and thick batter. From Seattle and loved them at Anthony's Home Port.   But my seniors platter for under $10 with drink and complete dinner of all fixings, Catfish & shrimp was just awesome. Ordered the fried oysters just to see if Penney was right and indeed, they were tender and just fantastic also. Can't wait to get the seafood all you can eat platter Thursday now. Just most wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good Friday Meat-less Meal: It's all about the hush puppies at the Hush Puppy for me.  We've been eating at this establishment for years since my son loves him some AYCE catfish and fries and I'm all about the AYCE hush puppies.  Yes, I know that they are not considered an entree, but I can eat A LOT of them with that delicious butter slathered on top (around?)--who cares if they're unhealthy and that we had a second basket brought to our table?  Our attentive waitress did not!  Eating here is like coming home--even the weird Polynesian/bamboo decor doesn't seem weird like it first did when we first started coming here.  My son and I ate dinner there last night for Good Friday and there was no wait--unusual since we usually have had to in the past.  The teenager had the AYCE fried catfish and fries, his standard.  I had the Iron Skillet Louisiana Shrimp with Fried Green Tomatoes, which is two skewers of grilled shrimp with seasoning--it's okay and I usually have this when we go instead of ordering the fried shrimp--that would just be too much bad stuff in one sitting!  The salad bar that comes with each meal includes cole slaw, which is probably the best thing at the salad bar--after all these years they still don't offer tomatoes or mushrooms for the salads?  No matter--I still got some green vegetables in me to counter the hush puppies and butter.  There are lots of other AYCE options on the menu, i.e., fish that I cannot eat due to my inconvenient fish allergy (but I can eat shellfish!), so I cannot speak to them.  However, my son loves his catfish and still says that Hush Puppy has the best around.  Our waitress was GREAT and non-judgmental, which helps when you want more, now!"}
{"text":"The service was ok. The waitress was pretty nice. I got the combination fish and shrimp. My husband got the shrimp. Kids got shrimp and fish kids combo. The prices for the kids was decent, 7.95 unlimited fish and shrimp. My plate was 16.50 and my husbands 15.95. Its also unlimited fish and shrimp. The food reminded me immediately of frozen Van de Kamp fish and shrimp that you buy at the grocery store in the tv dinner isle. My husband agreed. I was disappointed that we spent $60 on this. Not my cup of tea at all, sadly my friend warned me and we wanted to give it a shot anyways."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM. Had to go to that side of town for a late medical appt. Once finished, decided to drop in and give this place a try. It is ssssssoooo far from where we live in Green Valley.  The hush puppies they bring you (free, unlimited) were delicious. Never had hush puppies like this. Then a side order of fried green tomato appetizer. It tasted fresh, never frozen. Don't know where they get the tomatoes. Wonderful.  Salad bar had lots of interesting treats including tomato relish, cole slaw, sauces, etc. We were so full couldn't even enjoy the entrees. Had to bring home the fried oysters and chicken strips. The food was A+. Service was a little slow, couple big parties had them overwhelmed, but, it was still great.  Open a place in Green Valley, PLEASE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place, took the old man here when I was in town a few months ago. The only thing that really annoyed me about the place was the decor, there were a lot of like tiki lamps around which you would imagine you would find in a Polynesian eatery.  Food was incredible, service was spot on. Apparently the site has been around for like 40 years, which makes me even wonder more about the decor. Definitely going to go back when I am in town and drag the smaller older brother with us this time."}
{"text":"For what it is this property offers decent food, I went here 20 yrs ago and just went back to see what it was like... they still offer decent quality southern food but it's far from gourmet.  The atmosphere also leaves quite a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Hush Puppy, and after passing by the restaurant for years, I was excited. Nice and clean with interesting and a variety of pictures posted on walls. It is deceiving from the outside, and is larger than it looks, with various rooms that could easily accommodate large family gatherings with some privacy. Our group swelled in size from the original number (almost 2x's from initial), and with some maneuvering, we were accommodated. The staff was WONDERFUL!! Even with over 100 attendees, their attitudes were great...we know that isnt easy! Hats off to John, who was our Host and managed the staff and worked with us and ensured everything would be alright...and it was. Can't end this review without giving kudos to Jordan' (pronounced Jor-dahn) who is the perfect greeter, hostess and helped keep things in order. Of course, my catfish was really good, and I am a stickler for a good, hot baked potato...and it was great!  They have a senior menu and also have a all-you-can-eat menu that caries with shrimp, crab legs, catfish and ribs etc. I will be back"}
{"text":"Okay finally got to stop and eat here oderes a ton of food for a realy good price . The fgt was holy shit to die for. Sweet and not to musshy and firm . The catfishwas great the aligator was great  the clam strips was done right everything was done great and they have good prices  and im from the south so i know southern food thata done right. Go eat here !!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I are out here for about 2 weeks and we decided to do something called a \"coupon run\" and try to eat good for next to nothing.  One of the more popular places on the outskirts of the strip was this one and I can definitely see why. We just visited this place a few days ago and were very impressed with the mini-corn dog-like, golden hush puppies topped with honey. We got the buffet with the catfish and shrimp and stuff and salad bar. The salad bar was amazing! I recommend the mac salad for sure. All of the seafood was great and fresh but I still thought that the catfish was a bit bland and could have used a little bit more spice. Idk thats just me and my husband agreed also. The sweet tea there is the best sweet tea I have ever tasted in my life. If your in the area you have to give it a try.  Buffet was $13.99 Bad thing was the place opens at 5pm. (Its so popular that the parking lot is packed by 5:03pm!!!! )  The place has undergone remodeling so the picture posted is not updated. It looks a lot better. There is a diverse clientele but the weird thing was that we noticed how the hostess segregated the dinning area. We thought it was hilarious!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from this location off Door Dash. First off, the food traveled well, no sogginess issues. Everything was amazing. Alligator bites we're a huge hit. I wish I had ordered more of them.  The crispy fried fish was deliciously crisp on the outside yet so tender inside. The clam strips were crunchy with just the right bite to it. Not rubbery at all. I will definitely be ordering from them again. My whole family is raving about the delicious dinner, including our picky 6 year old."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to count. Every time my out-of-town  family visits, we come here once during their visit.  What we love: -  the AYCE catfish fillets are cooked to perfection. -  the chow chow is excellent.  This is a southern green tomato relish that is hard to find unless you're in the deep south.   5 stars for these 2 things being consistently good since I moved to LV in 1995.  What we don't love: the collards  The hush puppies are very good, the honey butter is addictive. The salad bar has the tartar sauce, lemons, and other condiments you may need, in addition to standard salad items."}
{"text":"Have been eating at this establishment since the early 80's, never had a bad meal here.  Just recently ate here, it had been awhile and still just as good, service was excellent, food as usual.....SUPERB, recommend to anyone that likes seafood."}
{"text":"No, not good. Friendly wait staff and hostess, but not good. We went on Thursday evening after 7pm, after the early dinner rush time; parking lot was maybe a quarter filled. We had the special which included fried clams...not sure why I ever liked fried clams when I was a kid...husband enjoyed the fried oysters. I thought the catfish was muddy tasting (but I'm used to actual live caught catfish with fat filets, not the skinny farm raised filets). Both the fried and peel-and-eat shrimp were fine. Very much liked the little fried corn muffins, that as another reviewer stated look like mini corn dogs - they do and with the honey butter they are hot and yummy! I believe they call these fried corn muffins hush puppies, but they were not like any hush puppy I've ever had/eaten. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised of this Cajun gem. Visiting from LA and seemed like a favorite with the locals.  Salad bar offers  their own kitchen-made salad dressings and tomato pickled side to pair with the fluffy catfish. Manager came to our table and gave us special treatment maybe because it looked like it was our first visit. I had the gumbo and craved for another bowl! The Hushpuppy is the place to go for family setting with delicious Cajun entrees."}
{"text":"This was my first time I felt Like I was at home with my family in the South. The blackened Tilapia and craw fish rice was great. My Boo loved the Alligator and the whole staff was great , nice and friendly.  One more thing the sweet tea was on point!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!!  Great food, great decor, and great service. The best collard greens I have ever had. We had fried oysters for a starter and although I have never had them before so I have nothing to compare them with they were very tasty.   The warm hush puppies with the honey butter was delicious!!  I had the crab legs which were perfect and plentiful. My sister had the all you can eat fried catfish that was also cooked perfectly. A great experience all around!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas for 10 years, and have passed by a thousand times at least. A friend of mine invited me for lunch one day and it was a nice surprise. I ordered the Jumbo Fried shrimp dinner and enjoyed the big tasty fried shrimp. I like that their meals come with a trip to the salad bar. The complimentary basket of hush puppies is always a yummy treat with that sweet honey butter! The staff is very friendly and on top of my sweet tea refills! This is a comfortable restaurant that is quite large inside. I also enjoyed the appetizer of fried green tomatoes! I will be back."}
{"text":"I went there Thur drive thru . Got fresh water fish that was so hard I couldn't bite into it and talk about salty . I went back and the girl was funny she replaced my long piece of fish with this joke! Never will be back assholes"}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for fried catfish, shrimp, piping hot hush puppies and some down home sides....this IS your place.  The quality of the food is consistent...consistently good!  They offer snow crabs as well, which aren't the best I have ever had but still quality for the price.  The salad bar is basic but the tomato relish is killer good, as well as the cole slaw.  The restaurant has a mixed decor which I'm not sure how it fits southern style food, but oh well!  This place is a regular for me when I want something a little more than some of the crab places in town offer."}
{"text":"I'm a huge crab guy and the Hush Puppy is must if you are in Vegas. Only come to the Hush Puppy's for two things: all-you-can-eat crab and of course hush puppy's. Don't expect a good ambiance, but do expect a wait."}
{"text":"I've only been to this eatery once but I want to go back as soon as I can.  I love Seafood and especially places that have an all you can eat policy; (Ive gained almost 30lbs in the past year and a half since moving to Vegas) but this only qualifies for an average local eatery spot. so this is your typical local eatery you have to wonder why is it so popular:?  The answer is that on Monday it is all you can eat Crab Legs; I heard about that and took a day off of work to get there at 4:30 (Restaurant opens at 5) When I arrived I was 15th in line so keep that in mind get here early for the best tables and to ensure you get your fair share of good/great crab legs.   Another thing I had while there was a jalapeno Hush Puppy. OMG if you like a little spice you must give them a try. They were free when I was there as they are hoping you fill up on them rather than the crab legs.  They bring out the regular Hushpuppies when you sit down so you will need to ask specifically for the jalapeno ones;   Be careful in the parking lot; I drove right over the curb and did some serious damage to my vehicle.  As upset as I am about that I still give this place 4 stars so you know I'm serious when I tell you that you will not be disappointed with the food or their wonderful wait staff;"}
{"text":"Love the salad bar and crab legs! Portions are a little smaller and the prices aren't all that great- sometimes I feel a little ripped off but it's good food and quick. Servers are friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"It's ok... its an old vintage place that has been around forever..   The all you can eat shrimp is good.  WOrth trying especially if you like catfish"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat at this location! My husband grew up eating at Hush Puppies and I have been here at least a few times. The service we received here tonight was, for lack of better terms, horrible! We literally only ended up here because Outback, Joes Crab Shack, and Red Lobster's waits were too long and we were hungry with kids in tote.  We ordered all you can eat meals for our family of 5. Long story short, after about 30 minutes of waiting and pleading with the host in passing to get our waiter, attempting to order our 2nd round, drink refills, and to speak to the manager, we were told our waiter was busy, I told him already, and the manager is cooking.  Yes, the floor manager was cooking! Anyhow, after a while our server came back with empty boxes, still no food, still no refills.  Seriously?! We decided to wait at the front with the cashier and even the other staff were apologetic and embarrassed.  Roger, the manager/cook came to the front, my husband shook his hand man to man and calmly told him what we just experienced.  He said he was busy (ha!) and told us this is their \"best\".  I asked is this seriously your best, because this is unacceptable.  He responds I'll take care of the check but \"just leave because obviously we can't help you here\".  Our mouths probably literally dropped. No apology. No food. No thank you. No ownership. No nothing but we can't help you here, maybe the other location can he adds the 3rd time. I looked at the young lady standing next to him in disbelief, I said wow and my family and I left.  I normally don't take my time with reviews, and this is as short of a version I could give.  I will never return to any of their locations.  We feel so disrespected and mistreated. I will eat at McDonald's before I ever give them another dime of the money we work hard for to enjoy eating out, their food is only mediocre anyhow.  Don't waste your time or money if you appreciate feeling like a valued customer.  There are many other options in Clark County you can get yummy cooked catfish, seafood, and real soul food from now.  Good Riddens Hush Puppy!"}
{"text":"It was my very first time I tried Southern cuisine and I had a blast! We ordered a combo of alligator tail and oysters. And my boyfriend got ribs. Everything was delicious. I couldn't believe I had a courage to eat a real alligator tail and yes, it tasted so good! The service was quick and very friendly! The manager John came to our table a few times to make sure we loved everything and were having a good time! At the end he offered us a delicious dessert,a beautiful sweet potato cake with ice cream and whipped cream! What a great experience! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for 25 years so it's long over due that I commend this fine establishment. The all you can eat cat fish is the best I've ever had in the USA. You can choose from fresh water or farm raised it just melts in your mouth. Service and price very good. I hate to let this gem out of the bag but they deserve lots of credit. They are only open for dinner. It's like a down home place from the south."}
{"text":"I've been going to both locations for over 15 years. I love their food. The alligator tail is good and my first experience trying it was there. I always go for the crab legs which are so delicious along with the all you can eat salad bar."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on Saturday January 28 and the food was fantastic. That's the good part. The service was as bad as I've ever had. My server Davida was the pits. I ordered a dozen oysters for my appetizer and they never came. My main dish was brought to the table and I asked where my oysters were and she said huh. So I canceled the appetizer and enjoyed my catfish. After the meal she asked if we wanted dessert. I ordered a piece of pecan pie to go. I just opened the box and low and behold there's a piece of sweet potato pie inside. It wasn't very crowded so I feel she was just plain incompetent! It's always been a treat to go to the restaurant when we visit Las Vegas, but now I will be eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a client and on our first visit was greeted by John, who gave us complimentary fried green tomatoes for being first timers! The food was AMAZING! The catfish was great, fried oysters, and gator tail were delish! Greens and sides were so good! I'm from Florida, only lived in Vegas for a year, so I KNOW my southern cooking! They have a small salad bar with pickled green tomato chow chow which is amazing with the catfish. You must go here! The only thing that threw me off was the decor. It was tiki torches and bamboo. Not even close to being anything southern? More suited for islands or something, but hey, that doesn't down their 5 stars, I'm going there to eat! And the food is incredible! But you guys might want to consider redecorating?!?"}
