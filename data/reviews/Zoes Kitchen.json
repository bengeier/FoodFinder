{"text":"I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Birkdale.  They are a healthy alternative to fast food.  It's cute inside.  Cheery and clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  They offered suggestions and their recommendations didn't disappoint.    I had a turkey wrap and pasta salad.  Very very good and fresh.  I am definately going to be a regular here.  Inexpensive and yummy.  That's what I'm talkin about :)"}
{"text":"Clean, simple, healthy and nice quality. A fast meal that is so much better than fast food.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I want to love Zoës Kitchen.  It seems to stand in defiance of everything that is standard in fast food, which is disregard for our health and for the planet.  But I cannot love it.  The food is good, but the experience is still fast food.  And the food is not *that* interesting.  Without analyzing which is more true to the values we want to embrace, the food at Zoës Kitchen is not, IMHO, as good as, say, the food at Just Fresh.  I am delighted that so many people are so enamored of Zoës Kitchen.  I am not, however, among them."}
{"text":"I used to go to Zoe's a few years ago but moved. I decided to give it a try when I was in the area. The food is just as good as it used to be. I can t say that for a lot of places. The quality of the food is good. I ordered a chicken pita with slaw. I had a side of pasta salad which had fresh basil, tomatoes, and feta cheese in it. I also splurged and had the chocolate cake which is so moist. The lime aid was good and not too sweet with a little bite to it. If you go I would recommend splurging for some cake."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The ingredients are always fresh and I can eat my vegan food and bring a non-vegan friend. They have a nice patio. I'd have given it a 5-star rating if it weren't for the noisy chairs on the patio. They need to get someone with a 3-D printer to get some pads for the feet; metal scraping on concrete is a hideous noise!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken kabob. Wish I asked for double chicken. Doesn't come with tzatziki  sauce so be prepared to like or dislike their Greek dressing"}
{"text":"I love love love Zoe's!  Due to a wheat allergy, my diet is restricted, and most of the time I am disappointed in menu options. But not at Zoe's!  The food is Ah-maz-ing!  Thank you Zoe's for your fresh ingredients and tasty food!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. What a relief to taste fresh made from scratch food. Wish one was closer to home."}
{"text":"Today was the last day I will ever eat from zoe's. Last time I got a 3 foot long hair in my chicken salad sandwich but I decided to give this location a chance and hope they wear hairnets at this one.  They not only messed up my order from grubhub (which is why they get 2 stars instead of one, they apparently had a hard time understanding the guy) but the food is far lower quality then I remember. I ordered 2 of the same dishes, chicken salad sandwich on whole grain and a side of potato salad, one sandwich came on rye and the other had the wrong side. I called the guy who delivered it and he had me call Zoe's. They said they would replace the rice with the potato salad and refund me for one meal (which came as cash with the new side). However, the potato salad was practically raw. My stomach is already giving me a nudge and I hope I don't have to call someone to finish my shift at work because of it. I wish I had gone with somewhere I normally order, I am totally turned off to this place now and will be telling everyone I know to avoid them. I am very disappointed and sad that I can't call Zoe's my favorite lunch option anymore."}
{"text":"My son does not like to eat healthy, like any five year old. But he begs me to go to Zoe's Chicken to get their kids chicken quesadilla! We have made it a family tradition to go their at least once a week. Thank you Zoe's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Tried Zoes for the first time tonight and it was OUTSTANDING!!!  Everything was delicious.  It honestly made Pitta Souvli look like dog food.  The lamb meatball appetizer was amazing.  The steak kabobs were seasoned and cooked perfectly, as were the roasted veggies.  Did I mention their dressing is great, too?  My wife had the chicken pita and my son had the salmon pita which they loved.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"A frequent spot for lunch when I worked around 7 Ave and McDowell. My favorite is the chicken pita #2 which is a pita jammed with chicken breasts, feta, grilled onions and fresh veggies. Sure there are sandwiches and salads but I can make those at home. Let there be meat!  Tips: Choose fruit or pasta. Ask very politely for pita chips instead. If you are retarded and can't build a sandwich, try Sack's. Place cake into mouth, not onto face."}
{"text":"it is very nice to have a healthier alternative during lunch. That being said, the food really isn't that great and is WAY OVERPRICED. My small pita sandwich (comes with a side), and drink was over $10 bucks. You can go to Paradise or Subway for a whole lot less. Not only that, but there is never any parking available, and most of the menu items are completely bland. Drop the prices and add some flavor to the food."}
{"text":"I have been several times and doesn't disappoint. Not going to be the cheapest place but most options are on the healthy side. Their slaw is great and the chicken salad can't be beat."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's.  The food is always good and the service is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.  I can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite."}
{"text":"The Chicken Dinner meal is so good!  I find different friends to go there with since I go often and always get the same meal.  I don't want people to think I'm weird by wanting to eat at the same place w/same meal all the time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love tomato soups and tried the Tomato Bisque.... Was to die for!!! I will definitely be a repeat for this deliciousness!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here and very happy with the food and the service. Woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful. She recommended having the sauce that I was uncertain about on the side and offered to get another side if we did not like the rosemary white beans. We liked the beans and the sauce! The food was fast and good. Place not fancy but nice."}
{"text":"Food is light, great and amazing. The service is excellent. Hummus trio is fresh, so was my fruit cup. My ham and rosemary piadina was absolutely amazing. I am full but not fat feeling   It was the perfect meal"}
{"text":"I love it. Fresh, convenient, clean, delicious and I always receive really friendly service."}
{"text":"Consistent, friendly, healthy, & delicious. Their app is basically the only restaurant app I use & it offers great deals. Its quick & casual but the food is substantial & healthy. I never feel guilty about eating out there."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have eaten here. Both experiences have been great. Tried the pita sandwich and the quinoa salad with chicken. Good sized portions and the food was fresh and tasty. Recommend this place as a healthy alternative."}
{"text":"I have tried the quinoa, hummus,Protein chicken salad, everything I've eaten there so far is AWESOME! However, I must tell you- if you want to try the one that is incredibly yummy and you can't go wrong is the Steak Kabobs.  I have been eating there weekly and have been using the place as a meeting place. The place is very relaxing and friendly environment. I am surprised that they don't serve any gyro though. However, I am glad we have another place to go to for healthier food in this area."}
{"text":"The most unfriendly lady at the counter was ruder than I have encountered in a long time. The food was good but hard to get past the unfriendliness and horrible service"}
{"text":"Have had two visits to this restaurant, which is approximately 25 minutes away from home. First visit, I was disappointed with the thirty minute wait time. I also had asked for no cheese due to a dairy allergy, but came home to find cheese in my dish. Second visit, learned my lesson and ordered ahead of time. Nonetheless, came home to find harrisa sauce missing on my harrisa salmon pita."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place.  I love quick, healthy food.  I was disappointed.  My cole slaw was super soggy and loaded with mayo.  I asked for no mustard on my club pita and it had mustard.  The pita was hard around the edges.    I am willing to give it another try.  Or maybe another location.  It could have been just a rare bad day.  The service was friendly."}
{"text":"Gotta clean the greens better. Saw what looked like cucumber peels in my salad. Have felt sick all afternoon since eating there. Service at counter is rushed and staffed by sarcastic, hungover kids. Another crappy lunch spot in north scottsdale getting more business than it deserves."}
{"text":"Great steak kababs!  Pita & hummus are really good too!  Great quick dinner with good quality food!!"}
{"text":"Walked out after waiting an hour. They weren't really busy, just couldn't figure out how to get it together.  Multiple groups walked out before we finally gave up too. Too bad, our first experience there was good. I was hoping we'd found a new go to spot, but I don't see us going back again.  Too many other good places that can bring you good food without having to wait for an hour.I"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for lunch. I had the tuna wrap. Light and refreshing. On the recommendation of Yelpers my bf had the  steak kabobs- he thought they were fantastic and hopes to recreate them at home. I may have stolen a piece of steak or three. Service was friendly, steady stream of  customers. Will return."}
{"text":"Love the food but they don't seem to be able to crack the code on service delivery.  Orders are routinely slow and often with errors.  Doesn't seem to affect the volume of customers so maybe it is just my bad luck!"}
{"text":"Zach!!! Awesome suggestions on what to eat!!! The food here is so fresh and flavorful. Tomato basil soup, white beans... delicious!!! Really filling for vegetarians and meat eaters. Clean restaurant, friendly atmosphere.  High praise."}
{"text":"Great : Salad + Dressing (in sqeeze bottle on table)  Good: Lime Ade Bread + Rice Service  Bad: Chicken Kabobs (really dry)"}
{"text":"I have been going to multiple Zoe's locations for many years and never had a complaint. Unfortunately, after my visit today me and my husband both got food poisoning. We actually both started feeling sick midway through our salads. Will not return to this location.. skeptical of how they prepare their food."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is freshly made and tastes great. I had the chicken kebob. The chicken was very tasty and cooked perfectly. The side salad was very fresh. Side of white beans was delicious. Everyone in our party really enjoyed their meals. Will definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food...one of my favorite go to places. Food is fresh and portions are generous.  Today I had the chicken salad and fruit plate and it was delicious. My friend had the Greek salad with chicken...perfect!   I feel like I had a treat but it was also healthy and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Three stars because the menu's hit or miss. I dream about the grilled feta sandwich. Toasted just right, soft and chewy, so tasty. But I gagged on the pimento cheese sandwich. Couldn't even finish it. Tried giving it to the dog when I got home, but she didn't want it either. And she'll eat anything. One time she ate a whole tube of Neosporin. Neosporin! What a freak. Love the pasta salad, but can't stand the potato salad. I keep going back, I just get the same thing every time. Almost took off another star because one time some chicken somehow ended up in my grilled feta sandwich (I don't eat chicken), which I didn't discover until I was chewing. Yuck!. Took me a long time to forgive, but I finally did. Haven't forgotten, though - I still peek inside before taking each bite."}
{"text":"I have been to Zoe's kitchen a couple of times and on most occasions leave pretty satisfied. It is a Mediterranean chain that offers up your standard fare of kabobs, hummus and such.   They have a wide selection of menu items for meat eaters and vegetarians ranging from soups, salads, and pita wraps to larger entrée style orders. They also offer an under 500 calorie menu as well as a gluten free menu which is nice for celiac sufferers or for people who omit gluten from their diet. My only complaint is the amount of added salt to the vast majority of their dishes. But I suppose that is to be expected when you are eating out.   Overall I recommend Zoe's kitchen for a casual lunch or dinner and to families eating out. You can also place your to go order online and pay in full before you pick up!"}
{"text":"I had to bump Zoe's up a star! Their hummus & pita plate is delish & I love the spinach roll ups, I think they're better than the chicken ones. I also bought a refillable cup that I can bring back for 99 cent refills. I usually come here to get a light, healthy lunch, but if you're feeling like some dessert their chocolate cake is freaking amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the spinach and mushroom Piadina.  The mozzarella was not melted at all and so thick,  I had to pull it off and throw it away on my plate.  I had a few leaves of spinach and a dash of mushrooms left.  The Piadina was wet and soggy because it sat in liquid which poured from the Piadina onto my plate. For $8.19, I expected some healthy food in the form of spinach and mushroom but way to little ingredients for that kind of money.   Please, charge me a little more and give me something in my Piadina.    My friend got the Greek salad.  Unknown to her, there was a baked potato in the bottom of the bowl.  She said it made the whole salad uneatable.   I read the ingredients on the menu and saw it said, potato salad on the bottom, not a broken up baked potato. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Omg door dash introduced me to this fantastic restaurant chain!   Unfortunately the location in Scottsdale doesn't have the veggie kabob that the chandler location offers. It is my favorite. It's insanely delicious, comes with a Greek salad and the most delicious rosemary white beans you'll ever try in your life! Hummus and pita are fantastic. The spinach roll ups are very yummy but very spinach flavored. They are delicious but I'm not such a fan of spinach. The bf says the chicken roll ups are incredible!  Always ahead if schedule. Just wish the Scottsdale location would offer the veggie kabob. I'd order all the time!"}
{"text":"There are very few places, outside of fast food, that you can take a family of 4 to and eat decently for less than $40. Local competition in that market would include Panera and Jason's Deli. As much as I enjoy soup, salad, and sandwiches, Zoe's Kitchen differentiates itself by offering moe unique items, such as roll-ups and kabobs. The employees have always been friendly, and the food tastes fresh. It has become our go-to place if we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"You know what? I was way too harsh on Zoe's in my previous review. I've caught myself eating at Zoe's much more often these days, and I can always count on a delicious meal. That deserves more than three stars.   I especially like the \"Grüben\" with potato salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"The Greek salad is delicious! So is the pesto hummus. I get them both every time I go."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff! I had the quinoa salad with chicken and it was plenty and delicious. Hubby had the kebab and was still hungry. Overall we'd go again!"}
{"text":"I ordered Zoe's catering for a girls night in.  Rebecca the catering manager was very honest and easy to work with.  I was nervous if I was ordering enough food for everyone and it was just perfect. They even had a person deliver it which made it super easy.  I ordered the game day goodies catering package and it was plenty for 12 women. We had a bunch of leftovers and my family loved eating them.  Everyone really loved the food and was talking about how good it was.  I would definitely order catering again and can't wait to go to the restaurant to try other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not the best.  I had been wanting to try Zoe's because I adored their logo and sign font outside their restaurant. Great color scheme. The interior was cute to match and even had local artists' works propped up on ledges which was nice to see the local support. I couldn't figure out if this was a chain or locally owned because it looked borderline corportate inside but had a lot of \"we support local\" types about.   As a first-timer I asked the counter girl her suggestion and she (and the woman behind her) were kind enough to offer up good suggestions. I order Zoe's Club Pita with pasta salad for $8. I walked away but doubled back to ask if it had come with a drink, the counter girl said no but gave me a drink anyway... uh, hello, so nice!  I'm glad I took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was AMAZING! A generous portion of feta cheese and tomatoes was delightful, my only complant was there wasn't enough. I wanted more!  My sandwhich on the other hand was a different story. The pita pocket had huge hole in it making it tear and really difficult to handle. The meat wasn't positioned all the way into the pocket and most of it was falling out the top. It was like three slices of ham had been wrapped around huge slices of grilled chicken and shoved into the pita. I was pretty sad to see this. I ate the whole thing and although it was tasty, it wasn't easy to keep altogether.  I really appreciated the counter girl's kindness in giving me a drink but the status of the sandwhich was enough to probably deter me from returning. Which is too bad because I love that they support local so much. Maybe I should have had a salad."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this location 2 stars is because the food is good... But I will no longer be going back. The service is TERRIBLE. The employees are awkward and uncomfortable when you call in an order and never seem to be trained properly. I work just next door and frequent this location... It's a shame because I love the food and its so convenient but it's too much of a hassle to go there anymore. Today, I came in to get my food and when I got to the counter I was greeted but then interrupted by the counter taking a phone call. She laughed and joked with who ever was on the line for a bit before then asking them what order she could take for them... I've been in customer service all my life... You ask them to hold so that you can take care of the customer in front of you first... OR, at the very least, apologize before answering the phone. After the phone call I was surprised to find out that the lady was the manager. I waited longer than normal for my food which felt weird because the place was empty and the manager and kitchen staff were laughing and having conversation. I was finally handed my food and was told that (we got the chicken roll ups.. So good btw) they didn't even cut them for us so that I didn't have to wait anymore.... I later called the manager and explained why I was upset... I'd rather have my food correct than rushed. I also explained other frustrations. There's not much that can be done unfortunately... The old crew was SO GREAT. This new one... is losing the company business."}
{"text":"I like zoes. It could be that my lunch options are limited during the work day. But regardless I like going here when I am craving healthy food.  I usually get the greek salad -hold the chicken ! and it is good.  I have also tried the grilled cheese adding tomatoe and onion to it and it tastes good as well. Also the grilled feta sandwhich is also a favorite. The feta can be a little much so I do take some of it out, but other than that I love it. The rice pilaf is lovely as well. I don't like that to substitue the greek salad as a side they charge you $3.00 extra dollars !! Outrageous. Also, on many times I have ordered the salad to go, have gotten back to work and realized they forgot to include dressing. Super annoying. But the manager gave me a free meal for the inconvenience. Overall. I like the place for a lunch option."}
{"text":"I've been to other Zoe's locations and I don't ever remember feeling this ripped off. The portions were smaller than kids meals. The Power Grain bowl serving wasn't even a \"bowl\" it was more like one cup of cooked rice and lentils thrown into a bowl. Barely. Sadly, I'm done with Zoe's. Terrible portions for the price. I can still get quality food two doors down at Chipotle for half the price and for an overflowing bowl. :("}
{"text":"Wonderful place to enjoy Mediterranean food. Stake Kabobs, Greek salad, Rosemary Ham & Mozzarella Piadina are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Customer service is always great and the food delicious. My co workers and I love coming here to eat and even take out for our whole team. Great experience so far definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast casual chain with healthy Mediterranean type food. You order at the counter, take your number and find a seat. The food is then brought to you. Both the Mediterranean chicken dish and Mediterranean chicken pita were delicious.   For the price and quality this place is great. Two people eating here and our bill was $20 for a filling, healthy meal. I would eat here all the time if there were one in my city."}
{"text":"Love Zoes slaw.  It is worth coming here just for that.  The parking here during the lunch hours is horrendous at best.  The lot is too small for the volume of business they do.  Their portions are good and food is flavorful.  I wanted to buy a 1/2 pint of slaw to go but they don't offer it anymore. Oh well."}
{"text":"This location sucks compared to the one on Camelback.  I've been to that one several times and this one is closer to my house so i was eager to visit it.  I was met with unmotivated and exasperated employees who didn't know what they were doing and didn't care.  A girl took my order and was horrible.  Then while waiting I went to the bathroom and there were no towels to wipe your hands (Health code violation).  So, then i went to get some napkins and those were all gone also.  I went back to the same girl and mentioned these things and she said with attitude 'I'll get right on that'.  She never did and later I saw her walk out with keys and purse in hand.  More people were coming out of the restrooms with wet hands looking for napkins that weren't there.  Huge mess.  I hope this location closes."}
{"text":"As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a \"spinach quesadilla\" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.   Then I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and really tastey food, recently tried the spinach wrap with chicken and it's by far one of my favorites"}
{"text":"I used to love Zoes Kitchen when I lived in Virginia. However, this location is terrible. I have been to this location about 4 times. I'm going to tell you about the last two times. A few months ago my daughter's and I came in to eat. I ended up finding a dead fly in my salad. I called over the manager and told and showed her. She apologized and made my meal free. She also told me I could get a free entree when I came back. I didn't plan on going back. But, today I went back and ordered a to go order for 3 entrees.  I got home and they over cooked the shrimp and zucchini, it was beyond chard. They forgot the bread and hardly gave us any rice. I got online and write a complaint, submitted the complaint and continued to eat my salad, cautiously.. and low and behold I found a bug with wings in my salad. I called the manager and told him what happened and that I didn't want anything for free. I just want them to fix it. So, if you decide to go to this location or maybe any other,  look through your salad and check your to go order before you leave. I will not be going to this or any other location ever again."}
{"text":"I crave Zoe's when I'm in the mood for something light and fairly healthy. I love their chicken salad and tuna salad. Both are pretty much just meat, mayo, and salt/pepper/spices, I think. No onions and no mustard make me a happy chicken/tuna salad eater! I also love their pimento cheese, feta slaw, and potato salad. The chocolate cake, though, is what hooked me onto Zoe's in the first place. It is basically a Texas sheet cake - moist, not too overpoweringly chocolatey, with that boiled fudge frosting that soaks in and seals in the goodness of the cake. {Droooool}"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly this is my to-go-to restaurant. I recommend the steak kabobs, really anything on their menu. This place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I can't leave a nice enough review for this location and its crew. We visited Christmas Eve, right before closing after our original dinner plans fell through. Though you could tell everyone was eager to get home (rightly so), they helped us with wonderful service, cheerful attitudes, and of course tasty food. I want to extend a heartfelt THANK YOU!!! My sister and I work in the food industry as well and know we were not the ideal customers given the time before closing and day-- yet this did not stop everyone from being kind and understanding. We will definitely be back (under better circumstances) to try more!   The hummus trio was very tasty, especially the pesto hummus with the crispier pita. Everyone loves the rice and greek salad as well. Only minor complaint would be the soup size for the price, but that's pretty common most places these days. Overall 5/5!"}
{"text":"My first experience was not a good one and I was contacted about it the next day and they offered to make it right. I went back and ordered the Greek salad and it was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful and the caramelized onions were amazing. Thank you"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for the chicken pita and there were 5 workers there and they were not even busy. I could see maybe 7-10 minutes but 15 minutes is just crazy for being a take and go type restaurant. Only one couple was in front of me and two other tables had people. Once I finally got my food I felt it had hardly any taste and certainly wasn't worth the wait. The only thing I liked was the white beans. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If I was able to give negative stars I would. Zoe's has been my favorite Greek salad place for the last few years. I have overlooked rude employees, messed up orders, and the other issues just to get the Greek salad I enjoy so much. After tonight, I have gone there for the last time after the last six times in a row the staff was rude and they screwed up my order.   Don't bother calling ahead for pickup since they will not make you food until you show up anyway. I have tried this many times and it's always the same reaction.   The staff seems careless and more about talking to each other and not servicing the customers.   The female cook who brought her kids into the restaurant and was sitting with them mocked me when I asked for no onions after they got my order wrong. She had to make it again and was offensive even though I did nothing wrong. Btw I didn't see her wash her hands after she re-entered the kitchen after sitting in the lobby with her kids.   Tonight was no different. They were out of cake which is why my wife likes going there, they changed their portions to a smaller take out bowl and forgot the pita bread which normally comes with the salad, luckily they didn't put onions on my salad which they normally do even when I ask for it not to be.  I am done .... don't make the mistake I have made so many times over by going there.."}
{"text":"An entire wall is printed with phrases that describe the food as \"Delivered fresh every day,\" \"Made from scratch every day,\" and other representations of fresh and natural food. We tried it for the first time tonight. The chicken kebabs were old and dried out and clearly cooked hours before. The shrimp kebabs were dry, tasteless, and overcooked. The rice, veggies, and kebabs - all we're overly seasoned with an insensitive combination of salty spices. Even the feta in the Greek salad was tasteless and low quality. What was good? The olives were good. The hummus trio was not bad, although not distinctive or flavorful. If you care about the food you eat, don't bother to come here. There are so many casual and inexpensive restaurants in the area that serve delicious Mediterranean style food, with quality ingredients and healthfully prepared -- including True Food Kitchen, Pita Jungle, and Saba."}
{"text":"I usually give Zoe's a 4 or 5 star but was so upset that they took the Spinach roll ups off the menu! This was a favorite item of my entire family. Bad call!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. Nice staff, great management and a clean welcoming environment. I've tried multiple items on the menu in which I liked all of them. I can easy say that the steak kabobs are literally AMAZING!! I'm extremely specific and picky when it comes to steak and was pleasantly surprised when I first had them, they were extremely juicy and tender, along with one of the best marinades I've ever tasted. One time the steak kabobs did come out over cooked and I had already driven home to eat, but the manager handled the situation phenomenally and was nice enough to personally remake them for me herself (in which they came out perfect) along with my money back.   Overall great place to eat, very fair pricing for how much food you get, and an extremely friendly staff. I would recommend this place to anyone and think you should at least try it once to see for yourself."}
{"text":"My food was really good so no complaints there. It just seemed like total disorganized chaos though. There didn't seem to be much urgency in getting food out. It took 25 minutes to get my togo order."}
{"text":"3 Stars is sufficient, it was just okay, I've had better at similar places like this. They also play this weird-ass music there, it was quite annoying, & I didn't like sitting in their hard plastic chairs either. :("}
{"text":"Nothing special. I pick one of the items pictured on their menu. The Spinach Roll-up with chicken. Which kind of tasted like Tostito's spinach dip with chicken wrapped in a tortilla. I was hungry, so no complaints.   It really seamed like a place for just lunch with some Greek influence.   The tomato bisque was good, a little salty, but good.  The experience was decent, if a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"I really love the chicken and tuna salad.  Goes very nicely with their sweet tea.  Good sevice and good salads, and an overall trendy and upbeat atmosphere.  I would recommend it definately.  Plus the staff is eally nice too."}
{"text":"They were able to cater an event for me and did a great job. Everyone (approximately 30 people) loves the different and healthy options. You must try their chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"Spinach wrap and iced  tea, can't go wrong.  Perfect for lunch. Always nice staff as well-service with a smile."}
{"text":"I live in Florida and visit family in Huntersville regularly. Look forward to a meal at Zoe's with each trip here! Food is always fresh and tasty, especially the pasta salad with fresh tomato, basil and feta. Prices are reasonable for the high quality. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nice to find fresh healthy food at a \"fast food\" location. Bravo, Zoe! Please come to Florida!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is spotty.  The last time we ordered, we got our food home only to realize they gave us all wrong side dishes.  When I called to complain, I didn't get an apology or even offered the correct food to make up for it.  All I was given was excuses and then told that I should have known better to order in a very specific way!"}
{"text":"First visit with Zoe's was quite nice. A beautiful sweet young lady ( Brandi) took my order. She was very professional, cheerful and helpful with the sandwich suggestion. Chicken salad sandwich was delicious. Loved the atmosphere and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the employee's are polite. The food is over priced with small portions. There appears to be a decline since they introduced the new menu."}
{"text":"I like Zoes. However, my GF does not. so I am only able to go when she is out of town. I understand this place is not for all. Dry chicken seems to be a big issue, as my girl has also complained about it. But I could eat a bucket of the slaw, with an IV of limeade, and a bed of chocolate cake to recline on.....oh yeah....wait. sorry... Anyhow, I always get the protein plate or the kabobs. Been a tad dry once, but I doused with dresing on table, and it was yum. Rice is good, the aforementioned cake and limeade. Really no desire to try anything else. With this place, I like what I like, and it will do."}
{"text":"I just discovered this fast food gem!   Very light and healthy flare with real deep flavors.  Nice modern decor, great prices and the food was outstanding!   I wish we had one where I live.   This chain has a real strong future."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 15 times and find it consistently good. Usually get chicken or salmon kabobs. Staff does good job. Fresh ingredients, little high on calories. Seating is sometimes limited and usually has a lot of kids."}
{"text":"They are officially open TODAY!  I lucked out and was gifted two free meals from their Facebook pre-opening promotions (and my mom couldn't use it -score one for me!).  They also are giving (maybe only today? Not sure) all guests a free refillable cup and promise a free refill for all of August!   If you haven't been to a Zoe's before, it's fresh-tasting, healthier fast food.  Their red pepper hummus is my absolute fave, and the chicken and salmon kabobs are the best.  For about $10-12, I get at least 2 full meals (if I'm not being gluttonous..).  With the chicken, you get 2 kabobs with veggies, plus rice, a side salad and pita. With the salmon, you get 2 kabobs with different veggies, plus a side Greek salad, raita, and pita with hummus. I do wish the chicken kabobs also came w/ a freebie hummus, but it's fairly cheap to add a small side or buy a full side for a few more bucks.  The staff is super chipper...such as my receiving a \"You're welcome very much\" in response to my \"thank you very much\" to an employee who held the door open for me :)  Money saving tip: download their app and upload your receipts. Nearly every time I have done this (for their other locations) I find myself with a 'goodie' notification. Also, you get a free entree on your birthday (with purchase)."}
{"text":"The staff are still very green and refer back to the manager for questions, but they are up and running as of this week, I believe, and they are totally hopping!  Maybe 4 or 5 tables outside and plenty of bright seating indoors.  Clean (open less than a week, so no shocker there), and their simply delicious and fresh food!  The salad dressing is their signature and available on all the tables. It's definitely not a light dressing though, so if you want something lighter, ask for the lemon vinaigrette on the side instead.  Download their app and get a free side of hummus.  Upload your receipt and get another free side on your subsequent visit."}
{"text":"So happy to see that No. Scottsdale now how's a local Zoës! Delicious, healthy, fast -serve food. You cannot go wrong with ordering the falafel, and or hummus as an extra!"}
{"text":"This was a very tasteful lunch I had. I ordered the power grain bowl, which consist of grains like lentils,rice and beans. It also came with pico and tazi sauce. If you never had Zoe's kitchen they are a Mediterranean greek food.  They have a quite few options and my job ordered steak kabobs and they were amazing. I love Zoe's kitchen and the staff is very nice. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We love Zoes, They had their kinks at the start but they worked them out and put a bad experience right. Zoes is the best fast casual healthy restaurant in Scottsdale. Thank you to the management for putting a once off bad experience right."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood and Zoe's looked like a good alternative to the pizza and burger places all over the place. I tried the Steak Kabobs, but unfortunately they were tough and I had to call in and let them know. I spoke with the manger, Nicole, who apologized for the inconvenience and invited me to come back in - she would give me a refund or a free meal. Today I went in and got the hummus with a pita and the Greek Chicken Pita. It was delicious! I'm so glad I gave it a second chance. This is going to be my new favorite local place for lunch. The chicken was tender, the pita's were perfect and the hummus was delicious! Great service and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"By far my favorite quick-go-to lunch place for delicious salads, chicken, hummus and more! I have never been disappointed with my selection. I typically get the hummus salad plate- their dressing is to die for and the cucumber side that comes with this dish is awesome! My hubby usually gets the steak roll ups and enjoys them a lot. One down side to this location is the lack of space for pick up/to-go orders. It is extremely cramped because the counter to pick up counter is right next to the drink fountain and bathroom hall so it's congested a the lunch hour and on weekends. The service is great though- always welcomed and served your meal with a smile. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My downtown friend saved me from the Arizona Center (where the Los Olivos car wash dropped me off) and took me here.  For under $7, their lunch deal was pretty amazing.  Pick a (good) sandwich, side and chips.  The reason why I'm impressed it was a whole chicken breast in my Med Chicken sandwich... I thought Greek marinara meant code for the tzitiki (sic) sauce, but really it was red marinara... Greek maybe for the green seasoning on the chicken?  Overall it was tasty, and the lemon limeade my friend calls crack.  Six blocks from Los Olivos car wash if you're trying to kill time.  Saw they have a security enabled wifi network but didn't try asking for the wep key to see if they share."}
{"text":"So happy to find one of my favorite eateries. First fell in love with Zoe's kitchen on the East coast, and happy to finally find one here in Arizona. Just wish (hint hint) Tucson had one!   Simple. Fresh. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group (10+) for dinner. They had plenty of seating to accommodate us and the food came out at a decent rate for all but two of us. They have a decent range of options and prices which was nice.   I ordered the chicken roll-ups, but from the look of it, I should have ordered the steak kabobs. The steak kabobs looked and tasted a lot better. There wasn't much to the chicken roll-ups. Basically some white meat, wrapped in a tortilla. They were good, but not really great. I would order something different next time. I was happy to see that they had sweet tea for a drink, but it was pretty bad actually. Tasted like they used half as much sugar as they should. Wound up dumping it out and drinking soda.   Overall, it was just ok in my book. Average price, average food. It's one of the better rabbit food joints that I've eaten at. I'm not a huge fan of this type of food, but if the group wants to go I don't object. You know, because I'm such a nice guy and all!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been lucky - I've always had great experiences at Zoe's.  The albacore tuna pita is great, as is the Greek chicken pita.  Today I had the Chicken pita pizza - amazeballs!  Also, the marinated slaw is to die for - huge chunks of feta cheese.  The service is always fast and friendly, and the food is always fresh.  It's a great lunch spot, if you can find a parking spot ;-)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? We had not been here since late spring and went for dinner recently. The young woman at the cash register was very nice. However, it went downhill from there. My husband's dinner came out immediately. Mine came out 45 minutes later. The poor server was almost in tears. There was nothing she could do. The manager was no help. He did not know what to do. Many other people were asking about their food as well. They were out of sweet tea and did not refill the dispenser even after people asked. There were two slices of lemon left in the bowl by the iced tea. They were shriveled up and brown."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! First time here and had the salmon pita sandwich with roasted veggies as a side, just had water to drink and total came out to be $10-11 with tax. Clean place and friendly staff. Good place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Ordering: The menu exclaimed that the chicken salad sandwich rocked, so I being easily persuaded ordered the chicken salad sandwich.    Each of their sandwiches comes with a side and a bag of potato chips.  I chose the potato salad.  I was given a number and I sat down.  The place was quite busy with only one center table available.  The food was brought out rather quickly.  The food: The sign lied to me.  It did not rock.  It was more like listening to Enya.  Shredded lettuce, tomato, ordinary chicken salad on regular store bought bread.  The potato salad was also rather bland.  Atmosphere: There were a lot of people and some nice music to go along with the chatter.  It had an exposed ceiling with large windows that faced McDowell.  The place gave off a nice downtown hipster vibe.  I gave the place an extra star because of the atmosphere.  Conclusion: Not quite as good as Paradise Bakery but, better pricing and atmosphere.  I will come back but, I will order something else."}
{"text":"This place was great and the staff was supper friendly. I had the chicken kabobs with rice and salad. My only complaint is that the salad had to many onions for my taste. Everything seemed fresh, and even though I didn't get one the cookies looked amazing. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do.   I have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake.   I have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice ....   Do you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes.   So, so sad!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time, and will definitely be back. Fresh, tasty, healthy food with lots of options. Red pepper hummus was flavorful, baked feta w/the addition of kalamata olives, tomato, basil - fabulous! Turkey stack, delicious not bland. Fresh fruit cup included a variety of fruit; cantaloupe, watermelon, grapes, orange, green apple, pineapple...Right-sized portions. Didn't feel it was overpriced for the quality ingredients, healthy meal it is (thank you!).  Keep the management with people who care not only about customers - so they keep coming back- but employees, too (their happiness reflects your image/resonates w/customers, after all), and this will remain a definite go-to.  Looking forward to trying more offerings."}
{"text":"I eat at Zoe's often because it's a convenient place to grab lunch quickly in between teaching and afternoon meetings. I would go there just for the limeade--best thing ever! I usually get the grilled cheese sandwich with a tomato on rye and coleslaw, but the quesadillas are good, too. Overall, a great place to grab lunch on the go."}
{"text":"This place is great if you hate things that get all assertive with your taste buds!  I really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland.  Maybe if they spent some money on a recipe book instead of a graphic design campaign, they'd do a little better.  The fact that it won something from the New Times proves how corrupt that process is."}
{"text":"I went to this location when they first opened and it was ok. I went today and things have changed. The manager and employees were friendly. Clean all around there. The food was excellent!  I got the Greek chicken pita and side salad. It was all delicious!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Looooove me some Zoe's Kitchen!!  Their steak kebabs are a thing of dreams.  So full of flavor and the side of potatoes are too.  I was very impressed with their kids chicken roll up.  Most kids menus at any restaurant seem to be very standard, boring items, but I tasted my son's roll up and it was actually very good and unique!"}
{"text":"Zoës Kitchen is one of my go-to \"let's grab lunch\" places. The Casa Paloma location is very convenient. Service is fast and cheerful. The restaurant usually clean and there is plenty of seating. I wish the tables / booths and chairs were larger, though. I'm 5'8\" and my husband is 6'4\" and no matter where we sit, we're pretty cramped.  I love their braised white beans and the orzo salad. (I really want to try the baked feta, too!)  The last time I was here, I noticed their Simply 500 menu and got really excited. It's a huge part of the menu that is either already under 500 calories or can be ordered to fall under 500 calories. YEEESSSSSSS. I ordered the Chicken Kabobs, Simply 500 style, and it was such a great lunch. Delicious and filling and 500 calories :)  As far as I could tell, the only difference was no pita bread or cucumber raita - while those are both delicious, I didn't miss them at all."}
{"text":"Sad review. We recently ordered for an office lunch, everyone raved. So I went again, service at counter was rude, didn't give me what I wanted. The guy cleaning tables was kind though, so star for him."}
{"text":"It was ok, not terrible but nothing to rave about.  They over charged us but refunded our card right away, then they got our order wrong. All in all it was ok, I just don't know if I will go back to give them another try."}
{"text":"Brought my husband here today and he loved this place too!  We tried the steak, chicken and shrimp kabobs. All were delicious. I have a feeling this will be a new regular dining place for us!"}
{"text":"Chicken kabob is dry and small. If you want real Mediterranean food go to the Persian room"}
{"text":"My work has bought Zoe's Kitchen for us for lunch from another location two other times, and both times I have had the spinach rollups to have a low calorie lunch (I actually get two lunches out of it, split those calories!).  I wanted to try them out in person, and my husband has not had them before.  We stopped in this past Saturday after a hike, we were tired and hungry!  My husband had some chicken dish and I had the chicken skewers, which my aunt also had.  Everything was flavorful and good.  I probably ate too much, but after a long hike, that is okay!    I really loved the greek dressing they had on the table, as did my husband.  So much that I wanted to get a bottle.  This is where they lose their stars, their food would give them 4 stars, but the dressing they lose a star, should really lose more, but I'll just stick with 3.  At any rate, my husband went back inside to get a bottle of the dressing, and I was a little disappointed when he came back out.  The bottle on the table had at least 2/3s more seasoning than what was in our bottle.  Actually looked pretty scrappy in comparison.  We decided to give ours a try anyways.  We opened it up last night, and sure enough, it was good, but it was not near as flavorful as what was on the table.  Kind of fill ripped off.  They pull you in with what is so awesome on the table, but then give you a crappy version of it when you buy it.  Or at least that is what happened to us.    I would go back because the food we have had is good, I actually now make spinach rollups for lunch on my own and they are great!  Just don't buy their products other than their food."}
{"text":"Very happy with our visit. Love the many gluten free options! I will be back. The tomato soup and chicken salad were my favs. I will want to try more as well. Also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To Spot for lunch. The food is always great, service even better and the prices just perfect.    I usually get the mediterranean  (sp?) tuna pita . it's a great soft pita filled with tuna, onions, capers and tomatoes. The tuna's mixed in with this oil and vinegar mixture, totally awesome! I sometimes will get the Greuben, which is a grlled reuben made with turkey and their home made slaw with feta!  My all time fave meal there is the Power Protein Plate, which is grilled chicken served with caramelized onions and a huge heap of the slaw!  They also have great sides like killer potato salad, pasta salad and the aforementioned slaw. If you're looking for a great pretty healthy spot to get lunch, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is great here but the staff is pretty rude and feels like you are an inconvenience. If you need anything or something isn't correct with your food, don't ask the girl running the food to correct it. She will grab your plate from you and drop another one off without saying a peep..."}
{"text":"Zoes used to be good but now has really gone Downhill.     **Zoes once cooked their chicken kabobs with peppers, tomatoes and onions ON the skewer. Now they cook the chicken (flavorless) without the veggies and offer them on the side (not even close to the same flavor) **Zoes once had a wonderful Pita Pizza on the menu! They removed it for unknown reasons being that it was a very popular item. **Zoes once had amazing brown rice served along with grilled chicken or sold as a side dish. They changed it to a really inferior rice that is no better than Uncle Bens. Why?  **Zoes used to offer homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. They offer them no longer and no one can explain why except that these choices are Corporate decisions.  **Zoes must be sharpening their pencils and cutting costs. It shows in the lack of quality throughout the food. What made Zoes successful is no longer the model they are choosing to follow. If you want fast Greek food, we suggest you look elsewhere. Hope this review helps as others have echoed the same sentiment."}
{"text":"At first, I was prepared for a \"meh, it's food\" experience because the menu seemed plain in its description. I ordered the chicken orzo soup, and red pepper hummus...again, wasn't expecting much. My husband ordered the chicken and slaw pita with pasta salad. MIL ordered a pick 2, Greek salad and chicken salad sandwich. My son got the kids chicken quesadilla. 3 limades. Oh my word, I was surprised. The limeade was hands down the best limade I have ever had. The pitas were fantastic!! Their Greek dressing is amazing. I didn't try the chicken salad. My soup was great. And after trying my husband's sandwich, I had him order me one. Though my son did not eat his food, it was surprisingly good for a kids meal item. I will definitely be going back!! It was worth every penny  (and that limade!)"}
{"text":"Every meal item we've tried is delicious. I'm not a hummus fan but theirs is amazing. Just picked up the Live Med salad today."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich shop! Everything is so fresh and made very well. My fave is the steak roll ups with pasta salad. And if you like hummus you must try the roasted red pepper hummus! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Osh my gosh.. finally a healthy, quick dinner option for me and the bf!  He suggested it, and I can't thank him enough.  We've only ever gotten takeout but every time its been spot on and amazing.  Truly."}
{"text":"Went tonight to Zoe's kitchen. There were quite a few people. The food was delicious! I can't wait to go back again. We ordered the hummus trio, chicken pita and lamb pita. With the pitas you get to choose one side. I had the rice pilaf and my husband had the grilled potato salad. The grilled potato salad was excellent! Customer service was great."}
{"text":"We had Zoe's last evening and LOVED it. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"A repeat visit found a much improved level of service. The staff were much more responsive and we had our orders after a short wait. The steak roll ups were very tasty, but I much prefer the shrimp kabobs. My wife loves the hummus trio."}
{"text":"Pro: Greek salad was amazing, the cake was really good, the rice okay and the lentil soup was alright.  Con: Had it delivered via postmates and my coke was only 3/4 full. The chicken salad sandwich was bland. The chicken wrapped in tortilla with salsa was not very good. The salsa is really bad and very mild.  Chicken in the salad was overcooked yet nicely seasoned so that wasn't a big deal.  I would come back, but only for the Greek salad with the chicken and pita."}
{"text":"Ate at one of my favorite places last night  Zoe's, but was terribly disappointed by the lack of cleanliness.  Whereas, normally there was always someone waiting to clear up dirty dishes and swab down the tables, last night there were dirty dishes on every booth table that were there when we arrived and still there when we left!!  Also, the area around the silverware and cold drinks counter was full of dirt, crumbs and,  at the back, what appeared to be mold.  Now, I must say that the food was still very good although my chicken is usually accompanied by grilled onions and they were absent last night. (I missed them but chose not to make a fuss).  Zoe's will get one more try but if the cleanliness issue is not addressed, my family will cross it off our list of favorite places.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Their Greek salad with chicken and chicken salad sandwich are amazing! The employees are always very sweet. I almost hate how much I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is wrong with this specific Zoes, frequent the one in the Ahwatukee and their service  and food is fairly consistent. This place however couldn't seem to get an order right. Chick kabobs were dry, roasted vegetables were cold and the rice pilaf tasted like it was a day old. Not sure why they can't afford to use real plates, instead of paper plates for dine-in customers like the other Zoe's. Poor service, subpar food and long wait times. Not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Zoes Kitchen......however.......they stopped serving the best item on the menu - the spinach roll-ups.    Why?   They have less calories than the other two roll-up items.   Why do restaurants do this?   This was my favorite item on the menu and now there's no reason to go there anymore.   So disappointed.   No other option even close - the spinach pantini has mushrooms in it so that's out.   Again, no idea why restaurants take off a perfectly good menu item."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic here. The chicken salad sandwich is consistently good and I always get the tomato soup with it. So delicious. I crave it almost weekly. Sometimes the line/wait can be long so it's super helpful to order ahead online :)"}
{"text":"I love Zoes. And this Zoes was even better than the others. Fresh delicious interesting food that will leave you satisfied. It's not easy to find gluten free foods on the road but they make it easy and delicious. Go here And love it."}
{"text":"Have driven by Zoes so many times and we finally stopped in yesterday for lunch. I got the quinoa salad and added chicken. The salad was so tasty and the chicken was moist and flavorful and their dressing is to die for!! My husband got the red pepper hummus and chicken orzo soup and both were delish!! I am so glad we decided to try it. We will definitely be back often!  Glad to know they cater too. May have to use them for my next party!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great prices and value.  This is basically a lunch and take-out fast food chain from Alabama.  It is mostly variations on Greek food.  They do it right.  This is the closest to Greek home cooking in a low priced restaurant I have ever eaten at.  No, it is not like being in Athens but it is closer than almost any other Greek place in the Phoenix area and I am including the fancu sit-down places.  The ourzo and the chicken are delicious.  For $20.00 two people can stuff themselves.  Love this place and have hit it every week since this location opened."}
{"text":"Over the years this has become one of my favorite places to eat! Consistently good food & service! To me it seems like the perfect combo of filling but still light. Perfect for a weekend afternoon or quick & tasty dinner during the week. Tonight, I met a friend after work & we both ordered our favorite salads, The Tossed Greek & the Orzo \"Tabouli\" Salad. Per usual it was delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would in a heartbeat. We ordered our food online and it was said to be ready at 11AM. Mind you, we went on our lunch break. Showed up at 11AM and the food wasn't ready. No problem. Figured it would be a few more minutes. Everyone is coming in with orders they made after us and are leaving with their food. So we are continuously asking why it's taking so long. The manager of the place was doing quality control, I'm assuming, by checking inside the to go plates. I noticed his hand had a bleeding cut on it. Didn't sound too appetizing to me. We asked for our money back and he was taking so long to even do that so we said forget it and waited until the food was ready. Left at 11:40AM. Cold food. Missing food. Possibly contaminated with blood. Shitty service. Spent $60 for this food. Let's all pray I still have my job because my lunch was longer than it was supposed to be and I still have to drive back.  A tip: if you're going to rummage through food, especially with a bleeding cut, wear gloves."}
{"text":"This new location offers excellent food for a good price. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You order at the counter and your food is brought to your table. They offer a nice patio outside as well as plenty of dining inside. Their Greek salad with chicken added, was very good. Nice warm, juicy chicken was added to a fresh mix of greens, cucumber, peppers and potatoes. Their Greek house dressing is on the tables for you. We also had there version of a Ruben, using turkey. It was nicely prepared and came with a choice of sides. We would definitely return, several other items we want to try."}
{"text":"Food was much better than expected and I am glad I tried it. Had the chicken pita pizza which was good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and the food has always been consistent. The Greek dressing is delicious, and they make some of the best chicken salad I've ever had. For a twist on coleslaw, try their marinated slaw (greek dressing and feta cheese). I also recommend the green/hibiscus tea. The staff is friendly and the location is awesome.   Parking can be a challenge during peak times, and call ahead/website ordering has never really worked out for me here. If you're pressed for time on a lunch break, you might be disappointed to find your food still being made even after the scheduled pickup time.   Overall a great place to eat in the valley."}
{"text":"I have to give it to them, their salads are great and so is their chicken. I love the pasta salad but sometimes I feel the basil can be overdone. I came in to pick up a to go order and the lady was texting on her phone, literally had me wait about 2 minutes to finish messing with her phone, THEN helped me out. This last time, luckily she wasn't around. All in all this place definitely has potential to be 5 star, just needs some polishing. Worth giving their Greek salad a taste though!"}
{"text":"I can't stop! This place is so delicious. I already wrote a review but I wish I can write many more. It's so fresh and healthy at least from what I order. I've attached a photo :) the steak is made so tender and tasty, I crave it when it's been a few days. I get the baked potatoes and they are so yummy and cooked to perfection! And the salad and the tziki (spelling?) sauce is yummy too. I'm a big big fan and I don't ever rate another place twice with 5 stars. The people who work here are so nice too! Very good customer service :)"}
{"text":"Much thanks to Zoe's kitchen and to it's staff and Matt Hameed! We had a wonderful catered ASU graduation lunch yesterday.  We started with a yummy trio humus platter, greek salad, chicken kabobs, rice, pita and fruit.  Thank you so much and we look forward to using your wonderful food and delivery service which arrived on time, real soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Zoe's Kitchen and very rarely have I been disappointed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the general ambience. Today, I ordered their Quinoa Salad and while I was more than half of it through I found a bug/mosquito in it. My request to the management is that the cleanliness that they maintain in the seating area should be reflected in the kitchen first and adequate measures must be taken before plating up the dish."}
{"text":"So I order the grilled veggie kabobs with side greek salad. The kabobs could not have been in the grill for more than 15 seconds. The veggies were cold and raw. 100% raw.  There wasn't a trace of feta on the Greek salad.  I guess that makes it an eek salad.   I was not up to complaining as we had not eaten all day and I didn't want to have to wait for my meal while my husband's entree was getting cold.  What a major disappointment.  I wanted to like Zoe's but this is not the first time our order was a miss.  No wonder why this place is always empty.  Fail."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had here is excellent (I've probably eaten here about 10 times).  The \"Grüben\" is my favorite (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye bread), but chicken roll-ups are a close second.  They offer a great selection of sides, and the fruit is always fresh. The limeade is so worth it in my opinion, though I don't think you get refills on that.  (Note if you buy a big cup you can bring it back for a deal on the limeade.)  Also note that if you check in on your Yelp phone app, Zoe's gives 10% off; every 3 check-ins gets you a free piece of chocolate cake. I'm a fan of the cake as are many others, though my wife didn't care for it.  Oh, and the parking: very tough to get right now with the construction next door. If you wait a few minutes you should get a space in the lot and won't have to park around the corner. (I haven't tried parking in the costume store lot.)"}
{"text":"I like this chain.   Good food, portions and reasonable prices.  This location is close to my work.  The only downside is that it is crazy busy from 1:30-1pm.  Weekend lunch and just mid-day in general is filled with Scottsdale moms with kids strollers ect.   I wish this location could streamline a \"to-go\" area for those of us on lunch break.   It takes a while to order and then you are forced to mill around waiting for your stuff while being bumped by strollers and feeling like an interloper as you hover by other people's tables.  Would be nice to have a bench or something?   Get us out of the way of the actual diners?   The hummus, Greek salad, chicken kebabs and tomato soup are awesome!   And buy a bottle of the house Greek dressing!"}
{"text":"A new franchise that seems to be opening in some high traffic areas.  Think McAlister's but, fresher ingredients, some kebobs, and a little bit more healthy.  Plus, they have a some booze.  A basic white or red(think it was cupcake) and then a couple bottles of beer.  I went in for what I thought would be a late lunch but the place was still packed.  The menu is relatively small, but with all the fusion restaurants in the area its nice to be able to decide in a minute or 2.  I had the Gruben.  Quite tasty, kind of a turkey and swiss on rye with a tangy sauce.  The potato salad side was not mayo based so it wasn't heavy on these hot days we've been having.  My counter part went for the pimento cheese sandwich.  Definitely not something I ordered but I had a bite and was quite impressed.  There was a smokiness and a spiciness to it, that I'm not used to.  Both dishes and drinks for less than 15 bucks worked fine with me.  If I was a working mom, this would be my go to catering spot.  Reasonably priced meals for 4, relatively healthy food, made fast.  Not something I'd drive far out of the way for, but definitely up on the list when in the area."}
{"text":"I tried the cauliflower rice bowl with chicken. It was delicious.  What a surprise!  I recommend it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I meet my husband here for lunch as often as I can. It is a bit pricey for being a fast food place but the food is so good. I always get the pita pizza and the pasta salad. Excellent place to eat. The decor is funky but the staff is usually really nice and again, the food is great!"}
{"text":"My first time at Zoe's - I have a Mediterranean background, so I'm a bit biased when it comes to Grecian/Turkish/Persian food, but they do a decent job. It took some time to come out (good sign it is fresh), and the hummus was very tasty. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I order family style meals from Zoe's for my office every few weeks. The food is delicious and always fresh. The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ALWAYS forget to put something in the bags. Yesterday was salad dressing and one of the sauces for the skewers. Another time it was pita chips that go with the hummus. The time before that we were missing a side.   Regardless, the food is always great! I would highly reccomend!"}
{"text":"Good quick lunch. Tasty. Great Hibiscus green tea. Good Greek Pita & pasta salad. The set up was very clean & cute. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pickup and ended up ordering the family meal. I have to say the price value ratio is great! There was a ton of food for a little over $40.00 about enough to feed 7people! We ordered the chicken marinara as our entree and it came with 1 side and we picked roasted veggies and included was pita, salad and hummus and the chicken was served over orzo. The chicken had great flavor and the orzo picked up the flavor of the tomato sauce very well however it was a tad overcooked. The roasted veggies are actually steamed with what tastes like butter and caramelized onions I would say it was just okay and then the salad was great and so was the dressing but the hummus and pita were not to my liking at all! The pita was cold as if it had been in the fridge! It didn't taste fresh out of the oven how they normally would at a Greek restaurant and the hummus lacked any flavor! It was completely bland which was such a shame!! Overall the value was great and I'd give it another go!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken salad, chicken kabobs. greek salad and tuna pitas. Great selection of sides. The app stinks; don't order online just call for pick up. Too much salt in a surprising number of dishes (read the nutrition info) especially for \"healthy food\". So it's occasional and we stick with the low-salt tried & true, which we love. Glad they opened and we'll be regulars but maybe they can lower the salt, for example, in their mediterranean chicken."}
{"text":"Great food,  clean restaurant,  fun atmosphere,  great service.  I will definitely be coming back.  I had the tossed Greek salad.  It was a good sized portion for a reasonable price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and healthy food!  Came in for a quick lunch after a movie. I was very happy with the salmon kebabs. They, along with the zucchini, come perfectly seasoned and grilled. Love the hummus and pita too. You can't come to Zoes without the touch of Greek deliciousness. Hubby got the tuna pita which is also great.  They have a new app and if you have pictures of your receipt, you can upload it for goodies. I believe the receipt needs to be greater than $7.00 to earn a goodie."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always fresh and yummy. Go here if you want something healthy and not your run-of-the-mill lunch fare."}
{"text":"Disappointment cannot express how I feel about what's been going on at this particular Zoe's Kitchen granted the cashier and staff even the manager great but when asked about why is it reduced amount of chicken on the Mediterranean Trio salad bowl there's no answers they say that that's what we normally get in this is not true I show pictures of what was really there and what's their given now is dramatically different for $10 you would expect to get more than what they're actually providing in the past.  I will try the different locations to see if they're doing the same thing but if it happens again I am going to write corporate to let them know that they have slacked off on the quality and quantity of what they're providing especially for the cost you expect at least a half of a chicken breast not two or three strips and thin strips on top of that once you order an entree for there especially for the price."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food, great service! \"Fast food\" to feel good about eating. Try the steak stack or the pitz pizza!"}
{"text":"Great Greek fast food.  Bright, clean, fresh and friendly. This is the Mediterranean version of Chipotle Mexican Grill.   This was my first time here and it took me a little while to sort through the menu.  I am not a huge Greek food fan, but this was spot on!"}
{"text":"So excited to have one close by. First time we tried to go they closed suddenly, asbestos I heard.  The next trip we visited our regular location off the I-10 and all our orders were mixed up and they closed the doors suddenly.  We ended up being credited for most of our meal. Tonight I finally got to try the new location. What a hot mess, I waited 30 minutes for a salad.  While I waited I watched food just sitting under the heat lamps. The manager kept yelling in the back, I need the food for Leslie now,  this lasted about 15 minutes.  When she wasn't yelling about that order it was steak kabobs with a side of rice. There were six cooks in that kitchen you think someone could have figured it out.  Get it together people!!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is the absolute best !  The food is consistently high quality, fresh, and prepared perfectly.  Service is fast and friendly as well.  I am so glad this place is in my area and i eat there very frequently.  This is your go - to place for eating healthy and enjoying it.  Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Up sides: Good flavor, modern and clean interior, order than sit down kind of place, everything tasted fresh, beef kabobs and veggies were very tasty. Down sides are prices are a bit steep, portions are smaller (probably how much we should eat but heh), no gyro type meats so more an Americanized Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"This is a decent chain providing Greek food.  I usually grab takeout here- chicken kabob with rice meal, side salad. It's good and the prices are decent. My last visit I totally ordered the wrong thing by mistake and they corrected my error and were super nice about it. I appreciated that and it made me a loyal customer.   Don't miss the chocolate cake- it's very good."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken kabobs. Came out cold and completely over cooked...rock hard! Sent them back, waited 20 minutes and they completely forgot about them. 1 minute later they brought out cold hard kabobs. They say they cook to order but that is not true. The shrimp had no flavor and were over cooked as wel. The rice is not actual pilaf. It tasted terrible! Please trust and go to your local Mediterranean restaurant. Anything is better than Zoe's. Completely grossed out and won't be back."}
{"text":"Like any other Zoe's, this location has great sandwiches, salads, kabobs, and more. The best thing is probably their cookies, which are AMAZING (don't look up the calorie count or you will regret it, I promise). I like the location -- Birkdale is super convenient -- but parking can sometimes be a challenge because of the popularity of this shopping center. Things are tight inside the restaurant, too, but they're very kid-friendly and don't mind if you have a stroller with you. Friendly staff, great food, great location."}
{"text":"This was my first time being there. The smell of the place was kind of stinky. The lady took my order and seemed like she was in a rush (there were no lines).  I got my food and drink. The milk tasted bad so I took it back up there and the lady was really rude about it.  I ordered the steak kabobs with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The steak itself was tasty. Juicy. Flavorful. The vegetables were old, and the potatoes were soggy and flavorless.   It's good to try new things so you know not to go there ever again :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good for fast food. I like the roasted vegetables and salmon kabob. Not a fan of the hummus which I found a bit salty  I recommend and will go back"}
{"text":"Love the one in downtown Phoenix, however the one by my office here in Scottsdale has a long way to go. My coworkers and I have been here a few times for lunch since this one opened and ever time we have been in they have managed to mess our many of our orders. The manager recently said it was due to trading the new staff for another location, but that was two visits ago. When you ask for items that your allergic to not to be included on your roll up or salad and the add them, it's a bit concerning. Granted, we should check the order, but how hard is it to get an order right. If you say no olives and it is on the ticket you would think you would make it like the slip says right? I suppose not.   I guess if I want Zoe's I am going to have to go downtown, because my coworkers and I will not be returning any time soon. Highly recommend not going to this Zoe's location."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since 2008, I moved away a couple of years ago and missed the food. They just opened this new location close to home. I'm surprised it wasn't busier although it was a Monday night. The food is still very good but prices are higher but they are everywhere these days and I say it's worth it for fresh healthy \"faster\" food. The staff is friendly and helpful. I hope this place does well and stays in the area fire a long time. Download their app and get free items."}
{"text":"Don't go here for lunch. The lunch portion sizes getting smaller and smaller yet the prices remain the same. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place.  The reason I say this it's like a Chipolte type dining- review the menu, and order at the register, grab a seat and food will be right on out.  Just stopped in for a light snack and had their Hummus Trio which was excellent.  Warm pita, sliced cucumber....and of course the three flavors of Hummus.  Original- yummy, creamy and smooth, not chunky like other places.  Went great with the cucumber.  Basil Pesto-  Talk about a nice twist.  Not overpowering but again very good.  Red Pepper- You actually had a bit of red pepper taste.  Perfect with the pita bread.  Service was friendly, place nicely decorated and very clean.  From what I saw the other dishes looked fantastic.  Now I'm not a big eat healthy kind of guy, but this place has my vote for freshness and flavor!"}
{"text":"I have this catered at work often.  Always fresh and delicious.  I especially enjoy the chicken kabob platter with brown rice and fresh salad with Pita.  Very consistent in taste and quality.   I always wonder why this location is not busier.  It is certainly a well kept secret."}
{"text":"Stopped in multiple times for a quick fresh tasting fast food Mediterranean dish. They have good service and wait times are not long at all. Zoe's is good, not great but good."}
{"text":"Good food... Happy to have a location near my home now. But sad to say the place was a wreck! Its 5:20 on a Tuesday night. 3 tables had people. Defiantly not to busy to be that dirty. Most tables hadn't been wiped down. Out of forks and the tea was out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 10 different occasions since the opening a couple months ago. Usually go for the kabobs - chicken, steak and salmon are delicious! Great service, food is very quick and consistent! Great location being right off the I-10. Go!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! Especially the steak kabobs and the live med salad! A very young girl at the counter was so sweet and had the best customer service. She wore a constant grin on her face. I later found out her name was Bree. We ordered to go, but we watched as Bree was so pleasant and accommodating to other customers. I have to say, with all the horrible customer service from people these days, this made my heart happy! Thanks Bree for exceeding or expectations!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. The potato salad was inedible. Undercooked potatoes and lacking any kind of flavor. I thought a gruben would be grilled but I guess I was wrong.  It was toasted with cold ingredients inside. Girl at the counter communicated in a very unclear manor. There were no forks so when I asked for one, I got a weird long explanation about having to go polish some. Blah. Wouldn't come back because there are too many other places available."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to get a quick Greek fix! The menu has lots of options to choose from!   I went for lunch and tried out the new cauliflower rice bowl with chicken and it was really tasty! Cauliflower rice is a great alternative if you don't want as many carbs and I think tastes just as good! Mixed with the dill, lemon sauce, and tzaki on top, it was a great healthy Greek dish! Good size for lunch cause it would not fill me up if it was dinner.   Only giving four stars because my co-worker said she had 2 bones in her salmon kabobs........"}
{"text":"Really good healthy choices. A bit pricey for adding protein on a salad but otherwise good food. Love the orzo salad with grilled chicken. Big enough for two people :)"}
{"text":"UPDATE TO THE UPDATE!  I was contacted by an area manager with Zoes and she expressed her extreme concern regarding our observations.  She listened and empathized, allowed me to explain all observations, and validated my concerns, but assured me Zoes Ahwatukee has passed their health inspections, and urged us to try again (she offered free food, but I declined).  She let me know that they had a team detailing the restrooms, and are making it a point to be sure all public areas are clean.  I will try one more time (again, because my wife loves it!) and let her know how it goes.  I'll take it up to three stars for the moment, until we see what's happened with the cleanliness aspect...if it's all good then it would be a definite 4 star experience as the staff there have all been very friendly and prompt, and the food is very good. Thank you for reaching out to me.  Update on my previous review, Zoe's said they were concerned about my observations and would like to learn now and gave me a link to email, I did, asked what they wanted to know and  they've not responded.  I also replied directly to the message, and they've not replied....... must not be very concerned.  Sadly, we're here again as my wife loves the food, and again, it's dirty.  You can see trash underneath the drink station and underneath the bus station, there's a dirty bucket with a rag in it, I'm assuming used to clean tables, over and over.  The runner carpet is filthy, and we're here before the lunch rush. As usual, the men's room is nasty, dirty toilet, floors and a layer of sticky dust on the paper towel dispenser.  SERIOUSLY, the kitchen is a massive concern if the public space is this bad, this early in the day.    There's your feedback Zoe's management.  Don't waste my time with pretend concern, just clean this place OFTEN."}
{"text":"Post Zoe's Kitchen Trauma- goes like this.  We went to Zoë's normally we have a good experience with occasional dirty dishes and silverware.  However, today we would have to rate them -stars except that Yelp insist you give at least one.   I order a cup of soup and my husband beef kabobs. Over 45 minutes later no food. Everyone was very upset as their food was taking forever too.  I had asked the girl if I could at least get my cup of  soup apparently, standing behind the counter waiting for customers is all she could handle. I persisted and said, it is just a cup of soup, she replied, we are busy your order should be up soon. Now, I have seen this place busy for lunches and we were no where close to that. This place was not packed really about 7 people total but when I discovered they were ALL waiting for food I decided it was time to go we asked for our money back and left.   It will be a long... long time before we ever return to this Zoë's Kitchen. But please don't allow me to influence you,  if you have nothing to do ALL DAY LONG this could be your favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Birkdale location. Food was good. i had the chicken pita,  Bathrooms were disgusting."}
{"text":"I am pleased Zoes opened another location near my office. I have been a huge fan for years and hated the drive to Camelback for their food. For the second day in a row I got the Chicken salad sandwich, chicken and orzo soup which is to die for and their rice pilaf, the perfect lunch. You can tell the food is fresh and it is beyond delicious with a great price point. The wait time is a bit high due to its grand opening however once it settles down I know it will be the perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town, we're touring musicians so fresh, fast, inexpensive food is super important to us on the road. We got excited as soon as we walked in the door. You could smell the freshness!  We had a hard time deciding, but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben. Both were fabulous, and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well. We so wish we had a place like this at home!"}
{"text":"Well I decided to give Zoe's Kitchen a chance to redeem themselves. I ordered the chicken kabob plate with veggies and turmeric rice. Everything was fresh and very yummy! The atmosphere was perfect with decent music playing just loud enough so you could hear it and have table conversation without the need to shout. The seating was comfortable and tables were clean. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!  Their kabobs are amazing! Fresh and healthy, so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here on a regular basis since they first opened, but after today I'm not sure I'll be able to return. I was enjoying my Greek salad for lunch today, which became grittier and grittier as I started to hit the bottom. After further observation it looks like the lettuce wasn't cleaned at all. I was pretty much eating a dirt salad."}
{"text":"I have had food form this restaurant a few times over an extended period of time. I have never eaten at Zoe's it was always take out and I did not do the picking up of the food. So no comment on the structure or service. It is not horrible, but also not quite good either. Very uninspired in all foods I have tasted. Sorta like eating dry white bread. We ordered as a group each time I ate, so I just figured it won't kill me so why not. Really a lousy reason to spend too much money for bland, but there you go."}
{"text":"So so delicious! Great food, great staff, great pricing.. I love this place and I'm constantly craving their food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Just didn't feel like making dinner tonite, and wanted something quick, yummy and good for me.  I noticed Zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out. The food was pretty good! I got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice. I left feeling full (but like the good kind, not the \"on my God I'm gonna pass out\" kind ;) and satisfied!  I gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for.  :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, quick service. Kinda pricey for the brown bag crowd. Great tea!"}
{"text":"Since moving back to Charlotte, I have probably ate at Zoe's more than any other restaurant that I can easily grab something to go. I always stop at the one in Birkdale Village since I am up there multiple times a week for teaching/taking classes.  At this point, I've tried a decent amount of the menu and can't say that there's anything that I didn't like.  It may be better for me to list what I haven't had, but after glancing at the menu I think this covers all of the menu items that I have had... *deep breath* tomato bisque, chicken salad sampler, chicken salad sandwich, steak rollups, spinach rollups, tabouli salad, greek chicken pita, steak kabobs and the chicken pita pizza. And their cookies are sinfully delicious.  You MUST download their app, you get free stuff aka \"goodies\", easy ordering, a nutrition calculator and even a daily dose of inspiration.  If you're looking for great food, quick service and a stellar staff, definitely pay Zoe's @ Birkdale a visit."}
{"text":"I've come into this place for a second time, and there will not be a third! The tables are untended, with dirty dishes all over the place. The floors are unswept, and outside the patio is the same. I ordered the shrimp kabob (which I usually get at Zoe's at Metropolitan and truly enjoy) and the quality of the meal was such that I did not come close to finishing. I gave this restaurant one star because it was the minimum. I'd really rate it a zero!"}
{"text":"Yum! We eat here once or twice a week. Everything on the menu is delicious and so healthy. Their hummus is amazing and you can't go here and not try the Tomato Bisque soup! You can't go wrong here, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pimento and cheese sandwich and it was phenomenal.  Everyone was very friendly and attentive.  Service was a little slow but it was worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Place is really quite good. My wife's salmon was impeccable. I love the tossed Greek with chicken, so yummy!"}
{"text":"My new lunch fav! I always take it to go. Decent flavors and fast service. I had their new lamb pita today. It was quite tasty. Sometimes it's difficult to find parking during lunch hours but otherwise it's a great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend!  Went with a group from work, we all ordered something different, and everyone loved their meal.  Generous portions, friendly staff, and clean tables.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times in the last month. Unfortunately, there is no consistency in the quality of food or service. When we were there Saturday night my husband and father ordered the beef skewers. The meat was not cut against the grain so was extremely chewy...basically inedible. The same issue with the meat in my son's steak rolls and nephews dish. The vegetables were burnt on several of our plates. There were 9 of us and 6 people got the their food after 30-40 minutes. The other three half an hour after that. The majority of our party was done eating. The hummus trio is very good as was the bread. Even with that caveat, I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Very overrated.  For such a new place I was disappointed by the fact that this place was dirty. Food on the floor. Tables un-bused. Pretty lax.  Now on to the food. Not great. My wife had the spinach/chicken roll up and it was seriously something looked like it was made by a high school culinary class ... and that's being mean to the high school culinary class. I ordered the steak kababobs , one of the most expensive items on the menu. Horrible. The steak was way over done and the veggies burnt. The sides, mixed veggies and smashed potatoes, were cold. Our son had the chicken salad sandwich which was not up to par with what we could have made at home. Needless to say we left food on the table.  The service at the counter was good ... or at least well intentioned. Otherwise we were never acknowledged, thanked, greeted or met with eye contact. This includes the two managers sitting at a table near us kibitzing over who knows what ... jobs elsewhere maybe? These folks don't look like they want your business.  This place won't make it. Its going up against Chipotle, Pita Jungle, Rumbi and some others that offer superior service and higher quality food. Considering that for two adults and one child we spent $30+ which included only entrees two limeades and a water ... we won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice culinary experience at Zoe's. The protein plate had a very generous helping of coleslaw, chicken and grilled onions. The coleslaw tasted very fresh. I don't know what type of dressing they used in it, but it was not your typical mayo dressing. It was lighter, flavorful and also had feta cheese in it.  Yummy.   The chicken was grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"I'm so excited Zoës is closer to me now. Today is the grand opening and it was a little busy around noon, but it was flowing nicely. They are giving away cups for your drink and you can get free refills for the month. I ordered the chicken kabob with the Greek salad and a side of quinoa (new item) it was good!  I also had a side of the hummus. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill. The food lately is always precooked and dry. I used to come here all the time and the food used to be much fresher. The food quality has been lacking though the last few times. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very nice restuarant, clean, good food, and great service. And did i mention, the guy who helped up was gorgeous! It's directly across the street from My Florist on McDowell, which in my opinion is a great area that i hope will continue to keep building up great new stores and restuarants. Nothing bad to say. Great patio right on the street definately a great place to eat right now when the weather is perfect."}
{"text":"Zoes is a fast-casual Mediterranean-inspired food chain that has over 200 locations across the US. We've got quite a few locations here in the Valley. This one just opened in Chandler a couple years back and I finally was able to grab dinner here. Like most chains, they cater and deliver and you can order your food ahead of time online or at the kiosk. Prices are average compared to most fast-casual restaurants. We had a nice experience one early evening. The restaurant was pretty clean and it wasn't too busy. Zoes likes to promote the Mediterranean lifestyle of eating. Their menu consist of soups and sandwiches, pitas and piadinas, kabobs and bowl. I personally love the pita sandwiches and the power grain bowl. The power bowl has some of my favorites like lentils, quinoa, rice, tzatziki, cucumbers and dill. It's nice to have a Zoes in my neighborhood as they are a great place for lunch or a quiet dinner when I'm in the mood for a fresh and quick meal."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen has become my number 1 post workout go to spot. If it weren't a bit pricey I would have it every time I work out! But unfortunately I've got to be more cautious with my spending so I find myself here on the harder workout days where I know I'm getting the best post workout meal to help replenish my body.  I love their steak and salmon kabobs. They have so much flavor and are so juicy. And the vegetables are grilled to perfection. They will allow you to substitute the sides which is great for someone looking to watch their carb intake. I always end up substituting their potatoes out for a Greek salad (comes with the steak entree) Their salad dressing is also a reason to head here. Even if it's just to buy a bottle to go.  They always have a clean atmosphere and very welcoming employees. Even after I come in all sweaty and gross, I don't feel like they're judging me."}
{"text":"My only real issue with Zoes Kitchen is that it was presented as a Greek/Mediteranean/Lebanese concept, and it was more like salads and sandwiches (i.e. no Gyro, no moussaka, just pita club sandwiches).  That said, I got the steak sandwich with the fruit bowl as my side, and it was really tasty.  Patty-melt kind of presentation, but steak, grilled onions, some sort of pesto or some such.  Very tasty!  The fruit was much better than your run-of-the-mill fruit bowl - actually pretty ripe.  Nice little lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying this is not a review of Zoe's as a whole or even their food (which I enjoy). This is a review of this particular location and their service. I came in last Sunday at 5:30 PM. At first, I legitimately thought they were closed because there was not a single car in their parking lot. I thought, \"Are they closed on Sundays?\". I walked in and realized they are indeed open on Sundays, it just happened to be there was not a single customer in there. I ordered a piadini and steak roll ups and sat down. A gentleman came in 5 minutes later and picked up an online order. He had issues with the order so they were busy fixing it. As he left, one of the employees came up to me and informed me they were out of the mayo they use on the piadini's. I could either have it without or wait for them to whip it up. After saying it would only be a few extra minutes, I decided to wait for the mayo. At this point, atleast 10 minutes had passed and I thought, \"Great, if they are telling me now that they don't have mayo, they haven't even started my order\". So, there I sat, still the only one there. After waiting a total of 15 minutes, a couple came in and ordered to go and sat down. Time passed on and eventually the woman looked at me and asked how long I had been waiting. Being on my phone and distracted, I hadn't realized that at that point, it was 30 minutes.... 30 MINUTES!!! And still nothing. I told her that and her eyes widened (for them, the wait was 15 minutes). The guy went up to check their order and he was promised it would be only a couple of minutes. Sure enough, a couple minutes later, an employee comes up with a bag with two boxes. I thought FINALLY! But no, it was the other people's food. They got their food, gave me a shocked look, kind of chuckled in a holy-cow kind of way and wished me good luck. Then, an employee comes up and asks me if I would like a cookie or cake or anything for waiting. At this point, waiting a total of 35 minutes and again being alone, I said no and that I just wanted my food. I asked how long it would be and the employee said they had no idea..... So 5 minutes later, 40 minutes after ordering, I went up to cancel my order. The employee at the front said sure and grabbed a manager to do the refund. This kind of upset me even more because if my food had been close to being done, wouldn't the employee say, \"Oh no no, your food is right there, it's almost done\" or something like that? Or perhaps, in an attempt to make me happy, say, If you don't mind waiting, we can refund your money but you can still have the food? Instead of me just cancelling and them throwing whatever food they had made away? So this made me believe that they hadn't even started my order still! To top it off, the manager came around and tried to joke about the situation, saying it wasn't their finest hour and a few other \"funny\" things to try and diffuse the situation. I didn't say anything and left. I sat in restaurant, mostly by myself with no one there, and waited 40 whole minutes for food that probably would have taken another 20. And I never even got my food so it was like I just decided to go sit in their restaurant and waste 40 minutes of my life. Oh and to add on top of everything, every time an employee came in and out of the kitchen, when I would look in, it was absolutely filthy. The floors were gray with dirt and filth and it just looked utterly disgusting. Probably a good thing I didn't get my food as I see a couple of reviews said they got food poisoning and others found flies in their food. Absolutely unreal. Look, I like Zoe's, I go to their downtown location quite often and honestly, I probably will again, but I will NEVER go back to their North Scottsdale location ever again."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and asked ourselves why it took us so long.   Good sized portions and food with lots of flavor.   We will be back more often"}
{"text":"Great food - like True Food at half the price. Excellent selection of tasty and healthy food. I wonder if we can BYOB?"}
{"text":"I tried the location on West Ray Road. The food service was very quick. I had the Greek Chicken pita with a side of rice pilaf. Both were tasty in a good lunch size. I sat outside and enjoyed the quiet setting. Nice place to enjoy good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could. I ordered the large family meal and man was it huge!  We ended up eating leftovers for days. The chicken kabobs were perfectly cooked. The pesto hummus was beautiful and delicious. We ordered for pickup and had no hiccups. They even accommodated our order pretty close to closing. The only disappointments was the salad dressing was, eh. It's like they didn't mix it up before putting it in the to go containers and they forgot to add our tzatziki in the bags. We'll definitely be back there."}
{"text":"The Gruben is really delicious. I'm not a fan of Rye bread so I get it on a sesame roll.   I've had the Greek Pita a few times and like others have said, the chicken is very dry.  The \"sauce\" they put on the table (a greek dressing like substance) can almost make up for dryness of the chicken but not quite.  I considered giving them an extra star because there's a dude named Yoder that works there who I pretend is a Zen like sandwich master from the Dagobah system who holds the secret recipe to the delicious slaw they put on the Gruben.    It's a bit of a cluster-F at the drink/napkin area...too tight in there for people but the fact that they have Diet Dr. P in the fountain makes up for it.  Like Nicole T, I'm a sucker for the DDP."}
{"text":"When  I feel like eating healthy this is where I go.  I love the mediteranean tuna pita.  I have tried numerous things on the menu including the chocolate cake (yummy).  I have never been disappointed with anything i ordered and the staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's kitchen. I live in Nj and when I come to Huntersville Zoe's is always a stop I make at least once while I'm here. This passed time I had  the chicken kabobs.  They were delicious, tho when they came out they had a giant hair in them. This was a first time this had happened. And I took it inside and they very quickly replaced the entire plate. Zoe's kitchen is a very quick place to eat. Service is fast and the food is delicious. The Rice Pilaf is one of my favorite side dishes they have. It's made with brown rice and it's to die for!! And I am a very picky eater! Also my one year old niece is a Cookie Monster and she loves Zoe's chocolate chip cookies !!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places to eat for lunch. I am never disappointed. My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich with a side of fruit. I never feel heavy after eating here or like I committed a crime eating delicious food."}
{"text":"I used to not go here anymore because the service was so slow. Decided to give it a shot again a few months ago...and the service still makes for 3 and not a 4 star review. I usually stick to the Greek chicken pita which I've had 3-4 times and it's kind of a hit in miss in terms of how good the chicken is cooked. Sometimes absolutely delicious and other times a little dry. A friend suggested I ask for hummus inside the pita (strange I know) but that really does the trick in terms of having a \"good\" pita there and if only they could improve their service speed so you don't have to wait 20 minutes each time they would get a 4. I almost gave them 4 this time around because a manager approached us as we were having dinner and of course noticed that we had to get up twice to ask if our order was almost ready. She was nice enough to comp our meal and gave us a gift card, but I don't want that kind act to compromise my review of Zoe's. So 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Five star service, very friendly staff, healthy fresh food options, vegan friendly. Clean and bright environment. Portions are generous and yummy chocolate chip cookies too!"}
{"text":"First time here, and our experience was ok! The hibiscus tea is a nice touch. They also have \"the good ice\" lol if you know what I mean.  We were greeted immediately and we placed our order with a young person. He got everything perfectly and patiently answered my questions.   The food was fresh and pretty good. It did take awhile to get our food though, considering there weren't many people dining at that time.   My main complaint is the food portion. The kids chicken strips were literally a few pieces of chicken. It comes with a side but I think it should come with at least 2 sides. My steak kabobs were well-done and a little over cooked. The grilled veggies portion is comparable to a kids side portion, so I would have liked to get more food for the price."}
{"text":"Very blah. Grilled potatoe salad is tasteless. Chicken salad sandwich also very bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Came over and had their \"Pick 2\" lunch combo and chose their best selling 1/2 chicken sandwich with quinoa.  Both were tasty, the chicken salad is a bit creamy but was perfect with quinoa on the side.  This is a good lunch joint, casual and clean!"}
{"text":"Zoës Kitchen had it's grand opening today and the three of us thought we would give them a try for dinner.   It's been almost a year since I first visited their location in Chandler and was looking forward when I heard they were opening a new location near Scottsdale Airport and Kierland.   A couple of quick observations, the food here is freshly prepared and very good. Most items are in the $7-$9 range, with an eye towards a healthier Mediterranean cuisine.  Because this was their grand opening, there was a great many extra managers floating around making sure things were running smoothly. Lots of happy faces behind the counter as well. If UR interested, they are giving away plastic drink cups (see photo) which are good for a free refill during the first month. Nice.   We ordered the Chicken Pita Pizza for $8.99 with a side salad, Chicken Rollups with a Pasta side for $7.89 and I had the Stacked Steak $7.59 with a side of Basil Humus for an extra $0.99. All were very good and I loved their Rosemary sandwich bread. Incredibly flavorful. We shared a huge Chocolate Chip cookie $1.99 for dessert, which must of had three different types of chocolate in it. Wow.   BTW, I joined the Zoë's Club and took a picture of our check with their App to record our visit. Our bill came to a very fair $31.78 for the three, before using my Birthday coupon (thank you Chandler) which brought the total to $23.59.   We very much enjoyed our meal at Zoë's and plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting food. Ordered hummus platter along with a salad and 1/2 sandwich.  Sandwich has one slice of meat, 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of lettuce.  It seemed quite simple compared to the other items on the menu.  different pita chips/bread were tasty."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen is great for a quick bite.  It was nice and quiet around dinner time.  I sat, ate my chicken roll ups and read the New Times. They were delicious.  The dipping salsa is to close to Pace.  That is my only beef with the dish.   My side was the pasta salad.  Wonderful.  I was wondering where to go for dinner for one.  I didn't want fast food and I didn't want to have to tip a waiter plus I wanted healthy food.  Zoe's delivered.  My bill was around eight dollars.  Who's a happy camper? (me) The hibiscus tea was very good.  I went for a refill.  All in all Zoe's is a satisfying option for your taste buds and your wallet."}
{"text":"I was there a few weeks ago during lunch.  The place is always packed, however the spend of service is horrific & management does not care about whether you gotten your food or not!!  After placing my order- soup & sandwich, I waited for 23 mins & still didn't get my food!!  A couple who came after me got one of their orders & by the time I walked up to request for a full refund, the other party was done with their meal!!    I should have look closer to the time but I was pre-occupied with other items to look after.  Although I did get my money back but I didn't get to eat & left with an empty stomach. Management only want to quickly refund me..like wanting to get rid of me quickly without making a scene- so unempathetic!!  By the time I walked out of that place, only 15 mins remained of my hour lunch.    Don't even bother with this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and dining area! The staff really went over and beyond in friendliness and hospitality. The Mediterranean chicken entree was so flavorful....and the rosemary white beans on the side stole the whole dish!! Being a Mediterranean restaurant - really wish they offered gyros!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food ! Mediterranean style . There Greek dressing is awesome . I put it on everything . Good service , quality food ."}
{"text":"The kabob dinner was delicious. The chicken tasted great, the greek salad it was served on was flavorful.  ***HOWEVER***  In an attempt to order, I stood DIRECTLY in front of a woman I presume was the manager for several minutes while she scribbled down a catering order as if her life depended on it. When she finally looked up, she pretended she hadn't seen me walk up (\"Oh, I didn't see you there...\" ...really?!? SO cliche, don't do all that, girl...) and implied I should have tried harder to make myself known. Thanks for the lesson on conducting myself socially , but NO THANKS.  The cherry on top of that experience was the latex glove I found buried in the greek salad on my second bite.   The food is good and most of the staff is friendly and attentive, but that woman!! She needs to be Gordon Ramsey-ed right in the face!"}
{"text":"It was late and I was doing some early Christmas shopping in west Chandler and I stumbled upon Zoës Kitchen. I decided to run in and grab something.   But when I got back to my office after my pickup, I was really impressed. I've heard so many good stories, so I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype.   For my first try, I went with their Steak Stack for $7.59 with a Hummus 5oz side for $0.79(see photos). The damage came to $9.06 including taxes, which seemed pretty good for everything.   What I wasn't prepared for was the tastiness of their bread. Don't get me wrong, everything was really very good. In fact, if they had used any commercial bread, this still would be a Four Star review. But the flavor of their rosemary bread was incredible. I would have paid $9.06 for a loaf of it. It was delicious!   So, go enjoy, Zoës Kitchen!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place saddens me. It is a void. It has a sterile atmosphere. The sandwiches were dry and not very good. The prices were high. The only reason that I went was because they handed out coupons in my neighborhood. If I had to say something good about this place, it would be that it is clean."}
{"text":"Bring back the old staff!! They never answer the phone, and when they do they're super rude. Even when you go in like I've read on other reviews it's like you're an inconvenience. They do get busy which is understandable but their customer service is crap. The old staff was a lot more friendly and made sure your order was correct every time. Bad idea replacing everyone."}
{"text":"Healthy and fresh food with quick service. The chicken kabobs are very flavorful and delicious on the Greek salad."}
{"text":"The food is always good and I Dont feel like I am ever eating bad here. Its always clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Zoe's Kitchen. The food wasn't bad, but I gave this restaurant 3 stars because we ordered online and the time it said to pick up our food was 6:05 but it still wasn't ready at 6:30! They weren't busy at all and the only excuse made was that the food was worth it. No food is worth waiting an extra 30 minutes for when you are hungry!  Super frustrating to order food for take out only to have it not be ready at the promised time and then have to sit around and wait almost a half hour longer. I have better things to do with my time then sit around at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was terrible! I had the veggie kebabs with salad and white beans, nothing was great. My husband had chicken salad Sandwich, his portion was tiny, it came on regular sliced bread as opposed to pita (as pictured) he had the potato salad side and the potatoes weren't cooked. Definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Super humus trio. Great service, clean restaurant. The quinoa salad is huge and has a great flavor! Love it all"}
{"text":"This place is a five star for all. Very quick on the table and extremely delicious to eat. Their cake is to die for and is home made.  Overall a very nice and quick bite place to hangout"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. I usually order their chicken orzo soup with a side of their potato salad. They're both seasoned with the right amount of good stuff it makes me feel healthy and happy. Their wait staff is friendly and helpful.  I went here a few days ago and they ran out of chicken orzo so I got their tomato bisque instead. A little on the tangy salty side but still good! Their cup size is plenty."}
{"text":"I love the Quinoa Salad. It's delicious. It's so nice to be able to go somewhere that a healthy menu is offered. I also must say that the oatmeal raisin cookies are Amazing!"}
{"text":"The location is so convenient, and the interior is bright and cheery but super casual (think a fast food place).  The service was excellent, but the whole time I was eating my overpriced Greek Chicken Pita I was thinking there wasn't anything very Greek about it.  Very bland with no sauce (it needed tzatziki or tahini) and quite a small portion.  Big Fat Greek or Gyro Express serve far better fare!  I won't be going back to Zoe's!"}
{"text":"This place is great. A lot of healthy options and if you don't want a healthy option try their chocolate chip cookies.:-) The staff is always uber friendly."}
{"text":"This place is just OK in my book. I love the idea... a healthy alternative to fast food but it could be better. The first time I went I liked it but it's also hard to screw up a grilled cheese sandwich. Sooo... I went back and tried it again. My fruit cup was sour, my sandwich was stale and just blah tasting. I could do with out it. It made me sad though... it's so close to work I thought I was going to have a great place for a quick meal that wasn't going to top 1000 calories."}
{"text":"Zoe's is a great place to go to when you dont want to cook dinner and you need something healthy.  I went there yesterday after the gym and ordered the chicken kabobs with extra salad.  Nothing really special about the actual meal, it is just chicken seasoned with some grilled veggies on a bed of salad.  One cool thing about this place is that you get a free small drink after 5pm when you order a dinner meal.  When I checked in on my iPhone I also received a 10% off my next meal there, so I will go back sometime soon.  The girl that helped me was really nice which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Zoës Kitchen.  They are right next to the popular yellow building that sells/rents costumes all year-round.  We happened to come in on Saturday (Halloween) and even though there seemed to be a lot of traffic on the outside, the restaurant had nobody in line and only two tables seated when we walked in.   The food was good.  Simple entrées with lots of flavor.   I've been told that they have a pretty good turnaround on getting the food out to you during the week.  As they should if people are in there during their short lunch breaks.   It's possible that they were short on staff for this particular Saturday because we waited over 15 minutes for our food before they brought it to our table.  The portions don't look big but are very filling.  I couldn't finish my meal.  We didn't have trouble finding a parking spot.  There was a Security officer making sure that only cars that parked in their small lot were going to the restaurants next to them... Zoës Kitchen, Chipotle, and Five Guys.   I will visit again."}
{"text":"Was driving by this place, and the bright colors caught my eye. We were curious--and hungry--so we decided to stop kind of last second and give it a try. The inside was funky-minimalist. More bright colors. Pretty cool. The menu was a bit limited, but we were still game. Not too much for vegetarians; my girlfriend ordered pasta salad. I ordered a Gruben sandwich, and we sat down. What happened next was discomforting....  I had to use the restroom, but someone was in it, so I stood outside of it for a minute. I heard the toilet flush, and then the door promptly opened. PROMPTLY opened. And out comes a kitchen worker for Zoes. Eeewww!! There is no way he had time to wash his hands in the 3 seconds between flush and door opening. Hmm...!  I wasn't long in the restroom, and when I sat back down my sandwich was made, so I'm relatively sure the non-handwasher didn't touch my sandwich. And the sandwich was actually pretty good tasting; but I cannot forgive a restaurant worker NOT washing his hands after using the restroom. Isn't that a law or something? I'd give this place a 1-star, but I kind of liked the sandwich and the staff was friendly. Nevertheless, I will probably not be back."}
{"text":"Happened to just stroll upon this place looking for some gluten free options while my sister was in town. We had a variety of salads, sandwiches and kids meals and all was great!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"For starters, I am not a fan of Mediterranean food, but I can see how people really dig this place. The food was really tasty, and the ambiance is nice and modern. I got a Lean Turkey Pita and with a side of potato salad and I liked it surprisingly. If you want to get a good Mediterranean meal and leave feeling full yet healthy, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat when I'm feeling healthy. Their wraps are all great and their kebabs are also good. I've had quite a few things off their menu and have yet to be disappointed. The service is great and we usually get our food quickly  Pro-tip for the owners: open one down here in Tucson, it'll do great."}
{"text":"Love Zoe's just not this location on Sunday night. Called in an order over 45 minutes ago and still waiting for our food. Empty restaurant. Could have gone to the store and made dinner faster than it has taken me to wait after my 5:30 pickup time. It is 6. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Now I can't comment on their service, as I took takeout...but this place is DELICIOUS! I'm always looking for healthy places to eat for lunch and sometimes it's a strike-out. You know those places....the ones that promote good, healthy eating and when you check their nutritional values you just gobbled down 800 calories and 64g of fat! I had their Greek Chicken Pita and it was FABULOUS! SO good, so fresh, so tasty....and you know what else? Totally healthy! The entire pita is only 300 calories, so if you're watching like I do, this is great. There's plenty on their menu to keep you coming back too. And while you're there, try the slaw, different, but quite good! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and the orzo soup is amazing. I also highly recommend the power grain bow"}
{"text":"Zoes always comes through! Delicious and healthy options. It's my go-to on a Monday after I've had a junk food weekend!   And I have to say that while the people who work there may not seem as polite, they always fix any concern that you might have with your meal. And that is suuuuper important!"}
{"text":"On my last day of my vacay with the family, we decided to get take out from Zoe's kitchen. My brother and sister-in-law raved about it, so I figured it would be good. Truth be told, it was just \"meh\". Now, with that said, my parents absolutely loved their choice: the chicken shish kebab. I ordered same but with shrimp. I had chicken the day before and was eating hummus and veggies for lunch all week so those two choices, which would have been at the top of my list from their menu, were not as enticing to me at that point in my stay. The shrimp was dry and boring. Would never order this option again. I might try Zoe's again but I would definitely stay away from the shrimp and would probably opt for a lunch here rather than dinner."}
{"text":"Good healthy food! Reasonably priced for what you get.  Love the steak kabobs and the steak wraps.  The salad is also very good."}
{"text":"Nice and airy but not impressed by the food.  While out shopping this morning, we decided to try Zoe's Kitchen at Birkdale. Been here for years but never got around to trying it.  My wife had never gotten around to trying Quinoa although I have and they had a Quinoa salad on the menu.  Therefore she ordered one but asked that it be served without olives or dressing. She's on some sort of diet and carries here own dressing in her purse.  I ordered the Rosemary Ham and Mozzarella Piadina and Potato Salad.  My wife ordered unsweetened tea and I got a cup of the Limeaid which was pretty good except a bit heavy on the cane sugar.  We found a table and seated ourselves and my wife went back to pick up some napkins and silverware. They need to check the setting on the dishwasher because of water spots and set had to go through multiple pieces to get a set that looked clean.  Our order came out and we had an immediate problem. My wife took one bite of the salad and it already had a dressing on it. She went to the manager and was told that was the only way it came.  I was not paying much attention at the time but shortly the manager came running out and said she had the wrong salad. Looking at the salad, it was on Orzo or Tabouli Salad with what I's going to guess was two Chicken Kabobs on top.  The replacement salad came out in record time and I do give high marks for catching and correcting the mistake but the mistake should not have occurred in the first place. The Quinoa Salad was good but not outstanding.  As for my lunch, it was a mixed bag that comes with dining here for the first time and not knowing the menu.  The Rosemary Ham and Mozzarella Sandwich was served hot and was absolutely delicious and was the highpoint point of the meal As for the potato salad, I probably should have read the menu description better but when you're standing at a counter with the menu overhead, it's a bit hard to do. The fine print says that the potato salad is made without mayo so consequently you end us with something with little or no taste and very poor texture.  Next time, I thing I will go with the Pasta Salad instead,  The restaurant is very nice and airy. Being a nice Spring Day with the temperature in the low 80's, would have been a good day to eat outside at one of the many table they have."}
{"text":"Decided to give Zoe's another try, tried a different location to see if service would improve. Service was better at this location than the fashion square location  But unfortunately I had the turkey melt and potato salad and got food poisoning. Don't know which of the two items gave it to me but it was my one and only meal of the day other than coffee and a croissant early morning and then my boyfriend had my leftovers and was also affected by the food. This was Saturday at around 315pm"}
{"text":"For how new this restaurant is, I really feel that there is no reason for it to smell like vomit. Because it reeks in here and it's retched and I don't think I'll want to come back because of it. They got my order about 80% wrong -- all the wrong sides with my chicken. The food was well-made and tasty, though, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This was a fresh take and a nice change from the \"normal\" fast lunches I am used to. One my first visit I asked the lady helping me what she recommended. She said the steak kabobs are excellent and so are the chicken. My partner and I got one of each, lets just say this has become a regular stop for us. Food was fresh and tasty and the staff have always been very pleasant."}
{"text":"Brand new clean restaurant with attentive service. The chicken kabobs is really moist, the rice is very tasty as well. We love it definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local places for a quick healthy lunch during the week. The tossed Greek salad with grilled chicken is very healthy and tasty. You can add or subtract items depending on your taste. I am a real fan of the App they offer for ordering ahead, it really saves time because when you arrive there it can take up to 15 minutes to order and receive your food since it's so popular and it's cooked fresh. I recommend the white beans or the roasted vegetable sides, they are delicious. If your going there for the first time and you want a sandwich then choose the Gruben, you won't be disappointed. All of the salads are great and if your wanting an entree the choose the salmon Kabobs!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Came here for the first time tonight and we will definitely be back. My sister and I both had the Steak Stack sandwiches, my husband had the Chicken Kebabs and my other daughter had the Chicken Salad and Fruit plate.  First, the customer service was amazing. Since it was our first time there, we took extra time looking over the menu trying to decide what we were going to have. The gentleman at the desk was so patient and explained to us that pretty much anything could be customized so if we wanted to add something or take something away or change something they were more than accommodating.  As we were waiting for food, the gentleman happened overhear my sister mention that she loves slaw but had ended up ordering the roasted veggies as her side. When he brought us our meal, he brought her some extra slaw so that she try it - it was so unique with great flavor.   Everything was absolutely delicious! Fresh, tasty, reasonably priced and with the added benefit of wonderful customer service... We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly employees, and pretty good Mediterranean cuisine for a chain. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Not overly impressed with their selections as they're more of an Americanized version of authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Overall, good food, ability to order ahead for pick up or dining in adds convenience, and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Zoe's get's a solid 3 stars b/c they have the raddest, most sinfully delightful chocolate cake around. The best part is it's only $2.00!  The reasonably sized slice of cake totally makes up for the boring, albeit sometimes satisfying food.  The chx kabobs are pretty awesome, enough for two people.  Comes with two huge scewers of chx, peppers, cherry tomatoes... over a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  Pretty delish.  The Gruben Sandwich is also a hit.  FYI -- If you don't like Feta, stay away from this place.  They put it on just about everything.  They trully believe in that old addage, \"Feta makes it Betta!\""}
{"text":"These guys were very friendly and provided great service.  They understood my family was not familiar with their menu and took the time to answer all our questions.  They even comped part of the order because we ordered incorrectly and they had to remake something."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch! Fresh, clean, and delicious. Hummus trio was yummy. Greek salad was crisp and the added chicken seasoned perfectly. The only change I would make next time is reducing the amount of lettuce in the bowl. It was huge but others may like it that way.   Thanks for a fast but healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"i love this place.  the decor is so happy and cheerful!!!  i've been twice in the past week - great experiences both times.  the first time, i ordered a veggie stack with white beans.  it was so delicious.  the stack (sandwich) had lots of veggies and cheese, also a little bit of herbal sauce on it.  great bread too.  the white beans were super yummy even at almost closing time.  they have rosemary in them too...mmm!  the second time, i ordered the spinach roll-ups.  they were so good and tasted so healthy.  i had the white beans again for my side because i had been dreaming of them from my first visit, lol!  they have really good limeade (i tasted my friend's) and select wine and beer as well.  both times we went at the last hour of opening, and it was all very fresh.  staff was excellent.  i will definitely go back..soon!  fresh food, happy decor, beer/wine.......close to shopping....thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Not their best performance.  I ordered my usual the Greek Salad no feta or raw onions.  Usually this is a salad on top of a bed of yummy potato salad which is dairy free.....today however they decided to use their pasta salad that has lots of feta cheese in it....I said no cheese People!  The chicken wasn't as moist as I have come to expect but the service was good and I'm sure if I had eaten-in they would have corrected it for me."}
{"text":"Fresh, affordable, delicious, nutritious food with a nice amount of variety with friendly service.  Mediterranean influenced menu with lots of healthy options.  They have Hibiscus Green Tea, Sweet Tea and Unsweetened Tea."}
{"text":"I would like one of these in NY please!  Up until the day I came here I had never had a pimento cheese sandwich before. Let alone a grilled pimento cheese sandwich. So, you must excuse my inability to comment on this pimento cheese sandwich in relation to others. But,  holy fscking god, was this food good!  So good I came back the next day to get spinach rolls. Which were like spinach pie but in a crispy tortilla style roll served with some tomato based salsa. T'was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Truly love this place health but yet super good.. Keep in mind it's some what of a fast food place. I love to grab an order to go and eat at a park. I always get the orzo tabouli salad with a shrimp kabob.  Wish they would put on in Gilbert.."}
{"text":"Love,love,love this place!!!did I say I love this place because I love this place...amazingly healthy fresh food that tastes great!!! I  am so very happy I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for it anymore. I have very yummy green hibiscus ice tea. I can't break away from their orzo tabouli salad with the shrimp skewer are on top. And I have Zoe's Greek dressing that's really yummy on it. Very clean hip place for lunch also great to take for a picnic .. but I have indoor and outdoor sitting here even a drive-through"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants... Delicious food, healthy, inexpensive. Just a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Time for my monthly lunch with my best friend. My friend picked Zoe's Kitchen. It turned out to be a good choice.  Concept: You go to the counter to order, are given a number to take to your table. You need to obtain your own drink, silverware, napkins, etc. You sit down and your food is brought to you when ready. If you've ever been to a Carl's Jr then you know what to expect for service. However, there are signs as you enter the establishment touting the freshness of the ingredients, stating that the food components are delivered and prepared fresh daily.  Food and Service: Since this is a largely self-service concept, there is limited contact with staff. The food was outstanding. My friend had the Greek salad with chicken ($9.69). It had greens, tomato, cucumber, onion, feta cheese, peppers, potato salad and bread. I had the Gruben sandwich ($7.59) with turkey, swiss cheese, slaw, and mustard on rye bread with a side (I picked some yummy white beans with rosemary). The bread was a very mild rye that looked white, not the hearty dark German rye I am used to. It was good though. The menu is diverse and interesting enough that I would eat here again to try some of the other items.  Seating: Booths and tables and chairs inside and a few tables and chairs on the sidewalk outside. For customers with a walker or a wheelchair it feels like a cramped obstacle course. The sound level was reasonable enough to carry on a conversation with your co-diners. Lighting was bright and cheery.  Parking: This upscale strip shopping center has a congested feeling traffic flow (who designs these things?). The handicapped parking is about 3 stores down from Zoe's, so a short walk for the mobility impaired."}
{"text":"First time to this place. It was in between lunch and dinner so there was hardly anyone there. Interior is slightly worn. You get in line and order off the menu boards behind the counter. Food was good, soup was fab! After ordering you get a number and choose your own table. A server will deliver you food to your table. I recommend this place for winter in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed 2 visits to Zoe's Kitchen in the past few months, and both times, it was a very good experience. The food is Mediterranean, healthy, delicious. There are good options to choose from--I'm always partial to the chicken. Our group has enjoyed the bowls (I like the Mediterranean Chicken Bowl and Power Grain Bowl), salads (Tossed Greek is good!), pitas and kabobs (chicken, salmon, shrimp, yum!). There are pre-packaged meals to go if you're in a hurry. You order at the front, then find a seat and the staff will bring your food. The only suggestion for improvement that I can see is to get the tables cleaned off quicker!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is super delicious and they are very nice people. I love their oatmeal cookies as well as their chicken noodle soup, greek salad, grilled potatoes and the chicken kabobs.."}
{"text":"Poor attempt by Zoe's to apologize. Once you lose a customer you lose them for good. Poor food is poor food and life is too short to go back to try garbage. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Great chicken salad... Gotta take my wife here!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite flavor of food!! Highly recommend for a flavorful, healthy, quick alternative to cooking at home."}
{"text":"I have loved Zoes after working just above the Scottsdale Fashion Square location, but I've noticed a significant dip in customer service and quality of food. Today's visit to the Chandler location was the last straw.  I came in early - right when they opened, and ordered a Power Grain bowl. I have recently started cutting back on meat and this looked like a great option that would fill me up. The meal took them 20 minutes and what I received was nothing like the picture - essentially a bowl of rice with tzatziki sauce next to it. I went up to ask if it was missing anything - the bowl was incredibly bland looking, and had no veggies. It didn't have the veggie relish, or the sauce that came with the bowl.  The girl seemed annoyed that I asked, and when I read off the menu she said they were out of the other items missing on the bowl. That would have been fine if I had known BEFORE ordering so I could've ordered something else. I wouldn't have minded a mistake even, but she was incredibly unapologetic and insincere. $11 for a bowl of just rice is pretty ridiculous.  I won't be visiting this or any other location after the slew of issues I have experienced while in these restaurants. The customer service has gone downhill and the people that have been hired the last few years don't have any care or regard for their customers. Time to find a new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"When this location first opened, it was wonderful.  I own a business in the airpark and my coworker and I used to order our lunch at least 2-3 times a week. There was a great manager and the employees were top notch and took pride in their work.,  They would recognize us when we came in and always get our order right. However, over the past few months, this location has gone downhill.  The food still tastes good, IF they get your order correct, but the wait times have increased a lot, there seems to be constant turnover, and most importantly, the quality of the food and service has diminished.  We now order only once every other week or so, and they always seem to get it wrong.    Case in point, today I ordered spinach wraps, add lettuce and tomato, and a side of hummus with half cucumber/half pita, and asked them to please not forget the salsa (which they have done several times in the past).  They did not add lettuce or tomato to the spinach wraps, gave me exactly 2 slices of cucumber and 2 triangles of pita for my hummus (not nearly enough - I had at least a third of the hummus leftover), and forgot the salsa.  This is what seems to happen every time we order lately.    We will be finding a new lunch spot, which is really disappointing as I did enjoy the food from Zoe's and the fact that it is healthy.  It's just not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Just opened in Birkdale Village, its not in the main area, its tucked away just down from the Movies.  You can't miss it though, a bright orange color is their theme. This place brings a lot of freshness to the table.  A lot of healthy items to choose from, but if someone with you doesn't dig healthy eats its okay!  They have a little something for everyone. What brought me to this scene was the Protein Power Plate-Delicious!  I've had it 4 or 5 times in the past 14 days-ha.   I took it to the next level and had Zoe's cater to one of my events- Box lunch that consisted of fresh roll-ups and salsa for dipping. Check out the menu- it's very good.....and someday I'll order more different things on the menu and let you know about it.   They have locations in a lot of places; it kind of just popped up without any warning!  3 Locations in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I catered lunch today for some of my medical providers and other staff. I'm rather meticulous when I order food for my team because I want it to look amazing and taste even better. Well, we enjoyed both of those things with Zoe's. First impression was with their delivery driver, he was extremely professional and thanked me for my business as he handed me my receipt. The food was absolutely delicious and just beautiful. It was exactly what I ordered. Then... it really blew my mind when I got a call from Nichole, at Zoe's, later that afternoon asking me how the food was and was everything how I ordered it and she asked me if I had any feedback. I was so impressed by their professionalism and a company that actually calls you to ask if they met your service standards. YES, Zoe's Kitchen on McDowell & 7th Ave in Phoenix you met all our services needs and then some.  Amazing food and staff!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is greek salad, potato salad, and Zoe's signature slaw.( not all together though, you'll explode)  I hate picnic food, but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn't believe. I practically go broke stopping here after work every day, but my job is so demanding that I fast all day...it's worth the wait!  And if you're ever in a rush, order your food ahead of time and just pick it up...then you don't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time (around 11pm-1pm)"}
{"text":"Very good food. Well decorated. Staff needs a. Little polishing, but expected since only opened two weeks ago. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I would say 10/10. Pretty friendly staff and good food. A girl is always sweeping the floor which is a little worrying but other than that I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Twice I've orders for parties with late notice. The staff member Lala was professional, had great suggestions, and put any worries i had at bay. I'll use again for sure - AND the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey stack and it looks like a steak stack. How disappointing. Last time I ordered my turkey stack it didn't look anything like this. I swear this looks like a patty melt."}
{"text":"Great food and it tastes healthy! My favorite is medeterranean chicken or pita and hummus with salad."}
{"text":"At McDowell, near 7th Avenue, we always like to get their Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken added. It's pretty hearty & we love their Greek Salad Dressing....yummy!  ....Kinda don't like sitting on their hard plastic chairs though.  :("}
{"text":"I don't like this place, but I think it's a great choice for people looking for a healthy meal. I've tried to give this place a chance, and on more then one occasion, however the food is quite bland. It's missing something. The chicken is often dry and while it appears to be seasoned, it is bordering tasteless. I appreciate their efforts to create a healthy and cool place to eat. It just didn't end up appealing to me."}
{"text":"Five star service, five star food.  I come to this particular location several times a week.  Download the app and get free food!"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was around.  Food was  amazing.  Great flavor.  Humus was delicious.  Will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Was driving thru town looking for a hole in the wall, but instead found this Mediterranean cuisine. I was tempted to keep driving, but figured screw it, let's try it out.   First impression - very commercial. Opposite of what I was looking for. Kind of depreciated my experience, since I prefer ma and pa types. Very clean and geometric, yet almost uncomfortable. Prices are average, and so is the food. Although, the people were friendly and quickly got my order to me.   Probably won't come back :("}
{"text":"It was my second time here today.  I had Salmon Kabobs the first time and they were good. The pieces of salmon were a decent size and tasty.  This time I tried the Tossed Greek Salad.  First of all, the chicken was almost non-existent.  My salad only had a few small, dry pieces of chicken in it.  Probably the same small chicken pieces that my husband and son were eating.  They had ordered the Chicken Kabobs.  My husband has had the Chicken Kabobs before and said that the pieces were not that small and dry before.  But back to my salad... I really have an issue with their signature Zoe's Dressing, it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  If you use the bottle on the table, you have to shake it up well and there still isn't that much flavor.  My salad was tossed in it and all I could taste was lettuce so I asked for a side of their Lemon Vinaigrette and that helped with the overall flavor.  The Tossed Greek Salad is served with a small bowl of pasta salad.  That was just ok, nothing special.    I really want to like Zoes because it's close to my house and it's healthier than some other options.  They also have a big menu using their main proteins in every possible way.  My son was hoping for some Gyros since it is a Mediterranean place but that is one protein that is not on the menu."}
{"text":"Their greek chicken pita is my favorite lunch dish.  And you need to add some of their house vinegar & oil."}
{"text":"The food has always been consistently good at all of the Zoes Kitchen locations that I've been to, but the customer service here on Ray Rd, is excellent!! A mistake was made on my takeout order about a week ago. I had called, and was told they'd make good on it, and they did today, when I came in for lunch.  The error was really minor, but their efforts for making good on it, and excellent customer service really shows.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I felt bad tonight because we were in a total hurry but we stopped in to grab a bite We hadn't been to Zoe's Kitchen so we weren't really sure what to expect After looking at the menu I decided on the Zoe's Club Pita with potato salad as my side I like how they have the Coke Free machines :) It wasn't extremely busy but our food took almost 30 minutes and we were in such a hurry that we almost got a refund Just because we had something due within the next hour The lady in charge of distributing the orders was very nice and let us know that our food was ready She even offered a chocolate cake Thank you! I felt so bad because I am one of the most patient people and I understand the restaurant business and time Next time we know about the online ordering and even the mobile app ordering  I got home and was very excited to eat my dinner and it was very tasty The pita had a great amount of grilled chicken & ham The potato salad was yummy as well  All in all, Zoe's kitchen is good in my book and the only head's up I would give to anyone is that this is a lovely sit down restaurant, very healthy and modern. The decor is very hip and modern and I really like the doors. It fits in well on the 7th Ave/Mcdowell strip   We will be back and hopefully next time we won't have to rush :)"}
{"text":"Love Zoes! I was a little disappointed that they ran out of the Salmon kebabs, which was ok because they have other delicious plates, but I ended up getting the tabouli salad, humus & pita.. What's even more gratifying to me was I ordered take-out  because my baby fell asleep in the car so when I ordered over the phone the employee offered to bring out my food to me when It was done.  Thanks guys, you rock!!!   Try their chocolate cake or cookies.. so darn delicious"}
{"text":"Cannot recommend the riced cauliflower bowl enough! The cauliflower, meat, the sauces, the veggies, the cheese. Super delicious.  Everything here is very fresh. Quick wait times too."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked to see that the overall rating for this place is a 3!  I just went there today for the first and I thought it was delicious.  I had the Spinach wrap (something rather) and it was really good. The picture of it makes it look like a much bigger portion, but for once I wasn't annoyed by that, because it was still filling.  It also came with a side, which I got pasta salad, which was really good too in my opinion, and I'm pretty picky about pasta salads! It's not your \"typical\" pasta salad, but it's flavorful.  I took the advice of the worker and put some dressing on the salad (dressing found on all the tables) and that added a little zing to it too.    Very good service too, all of the people were really nice, and genuinely nice, not the fake stuff .  I would go there again!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a colleague. Looking for something relatively healthy and not too heavy. Was very satisfied with my meal of 2 chicken kabobs, rice and side salad accompanied with a couple of pieces of pita . Very simple, fresh tasting meal. The tables are stocked with a bottle of what appears to be their homemade vinaigrette dressing, also very tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how this place rates a three star average. Just like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place. The concept is great! But that's it, it's just a concept. The food is as sterile as the environment. The only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture... each item has the same bland taste. And as I am somewhat of a foodie, the thing that is most amazing is that I know you have to work to make food this blah. The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.  I suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed, but IMHO save your money and take yourself anywhere else.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is always consistent, haven't had a bad meal. The chocolate chips cookies are soooo yummy! The staffs are very friendly."}
{"text":"A new healthy vegetarian-friendly, well-priced lunch spot that I am excited about! My mom and I decided to stop here for lunch today and we were very pleased with our first visit to Zoe's Kitchen. It was super clean when we went, and I loved how they have children's art up on the walls. Very colorful in there and aesthetically pleasing. I was happy to see an extensive menu when I walked in, a bunch of vegetarian options! Also they had cookies and brownies that I had to resist to buy, but they looked so good. My mom got a protein plate, and I ordered veggie kabobs. The guy taking our order did a good job, our food came out really fast. My mom loved her protein plate! She said that the chicken was really good, not too dry or anything. My veggie kabobs were very yummy too, though I think maybe having some kind of sauce or ordering a side of hummus next time would've made it even better. I got rice pilaf and Greek salad without cheese as my sides. The rice pilaf was good! Greek salad was like any other Greek salad, nothing special but it's cool because they make the dressing from scratch! There was a wide array of sides to choose from too so I'd want to try a different one next time. Pita bread was meh, would've been better if it was served toasted, but that's not a big deal. Overall really liked my food and experience here!"}
{"text":"I like it here- food is healthy, quick and friendly service, good location. I was going to offer a few bites of my meal to share with my friend, but it was so good, I ate it all. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food isn't great.  I really only like the chocolate cake which is strangely sweet but does not have much chocolate flavor.  (Still I'm strangely addicted to it).  The food is rather bland, the main flavoring ingredient seems to be salt and oregano and that's about it."}
{"text":"Although food in Scottsdale is very good it is no usually balanced or healthy. Zoe's is fresh and has lots of veges in dishes. $20 for two is a bargain. This will  be one of our \"go to\" places for fast casual"}
{"text":"First time trying Zoe's today with my two young kids and all three of us loved it! My son, who is super picky loved the grilled chicken fingers. My daughter and I shared the chicken pita with Greek salad and wow was it delicious! Everything is so fresh and tasty! I love that the Greek dressing is on every table that way I control how much or little I add to my salad. We all were happy to be eating healthy, delicious and fresh food. We said it's our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"We had been to a Zoe's in Virginia a few years back & didn't care for it. But we decided to give it a try again and really liked it!!  We got steal kabobs. They were tender & cooked perfectly. They came with steamed veggies & some kind of potatoes  we really enjoyed it & will go back"}
{"text":"I have visited this locations a few times now. About a month ago I ordered a family meal to go. I called in 2 hours before I was going to be there, since I wanted to make sure it was ready when I got there. When I arrived I paid and the man at the register said he was waiting in the kabobs. I waited for about 15 minutes before he finally asked the chef for them,. They had been ready the whole time! I was frustrated to find out I waited for nothing. I called the next day and complained to the manager. He apologized and and offered me gift card.   Today I called in an order again, the same man was behind the register. I paid and he immediately asked how long until my order was done. He let me know it would be about 4 minutes and offered me a fee drink while I waited. My meal was ready in the 4 minutes he quoted me. I'm so pleased to see that they have taken the time to improve service. I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"They remembered I ordered the Gruben every time I come here, impressive"}
{"text":"The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.     My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Zoe's at the Metropolitan as well as their South Charlotte locations, so when I moved to Huntersville and tried the Birkdale location, I expected to enjoy the usual deliciousness. Unfortunately, my very favorite spinach rolls had no feta in them and were super bland. The slaw I typically love was also really bland and just tasted like oily cabbage. On the other hand, my mom's shrimp kabobs had SO much seasoning that they were almost inedible. Not sure what's going on here, but the consistent Zoe's quality was missing and someone needs to revisit their recipes."}
{"text":"Absolutely 5 stars! Great service and amazing, fresh food. The girls at the counter were super friendly and accommodating. They understand allergies (gluten) and made were very quick to fix the issue when pita was accidentally placed on my plate. We ordered the chicken kebabs with grilled veggies and salad. The veggies were perfect and the chicken was grilled tender, not dry at all. We left full and satisfied but not feeling guilty (cause it's so healthy). So happy this is in our neighborhood.  P.S. I forgot to take a photo cause I was so quick to dig in and enjoy. I'll have to add one next time."}
{"text":"I don't even have words right now to describe the party my tastebuds and stomach are having, so I will keep it simple... walked in the front door having no idea what kind of food they served, never imagined it would be Mediterranean, ordered the steak kabobs with the marinated slaw and salad as my sides, almost died in heaven. Seriously some of the best food I have had in my life!!! I want to go back again tonight for dinner and try something else off their menu! Soooooo delicious! Try it ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times now. We have really enjoyed the food and this is now our new go to place for Mediterranean food.  Really enjoyed the Greek Chicken Pita and marinated slaw."}
{"text":"I am in love...with Zoe's grilled feta sandwich. Everytime my co-workers and I go for lunch, I always tell myself I am going to try something else on the menu...and then I don't because I don't want to cheat on the grilled feta. My sandwich is always toasted perfectly and the tomato on the sandwich helps tone down the feta just a touch. The pasta salad is my favorite of the sides to get. I tried the potato salad once and was not wowed by it at all. For almost $9 which buys a drink, sandwich, side and chips, I always leave contently full.  As a warning, if you don't like feta cheese, this may not be the place for you. About 99% of the items on the menu contain it."}
{"text":"Just ordered the chicken salad and fruit plate.  Half of my grapes are black and rotten, the pineapple is UNDER ripe, and half my lettuce is wilted and mushy. I'm so grossed out and don't even know who to call because I ordered on line and just picked it up. What a waste."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Zoe's Kitchen. We placed a to-go order online about 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday night, yet the staff was still more than happy to help us. Our food was prepared quickly and packed well within the bag to keep it fresh and prevent any spilling. Everything was still warm and delicious by the time it reached our house. The food was great and the chicken was tender and fresh despite being so close to closing. We really enjoyed the slaw. We'll definitely be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Zoes is a great choice if you are looking for relatively healthy and freshly prepared Mediterranean food.  They have pitas, kabobs, salads, entrees and bowls.  I was also very impressed by the quantity and quality of sides.  The food seemed light, but some of the dressings and sauces can get a little high in fat.  Prices are also very reasonable considering the meats are good portions and very filling.  The restaurant is bright and has plenty of seating that makes dining there a good option."}
{"text":"So I have this terrible addiction. Every time I go anywhere near downtown, I have to go to Zoe's.  I LOVE their limeade and have often wished I could just order the whole pitcher and leave the place with it.  I'm a big fan of the chicken pita with loads of Feta, caramelized onions and chicken.  I know I should probably branch out and try something new, but nothing beats the limeade and chicken pita with pasta salad.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"The gyros are worth the drive from Tucson. Tzaziki sauce is the perfect blend of spices.  We order the salmon and lamb."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The service is exceptional, the food is always top-notch, the  environment is positive, up-beat, clean, etc.   I stopped in today to get a quick tea (the hibiscus tea). The guy at the front was so astonished that I came by just for a tea, that he gave it to me for free! I always have a great experience there. Me and my coworkers go there at least twice a month for lunch on Friday's (our lunch day).   My favorite dishes are the roll-ups and the hummus. You can never go wrong with either of those. And of course the tea!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious food on the light side, this is the spot.   I usually have the Gruben Sandwich with slaw on the side but lately i've been going for their Quinoa Salad.  The location is perfect and staff is polite.  Parking can be an issue if you go during peak hours."}
{"text":"Summary. Food good. Service in the evening is terrible. Took 45 minutes from entering to leaving on two occasions. Terrible. They need some management overhaul."}
{"text":"The food here is okay... nothing to rave about. The rice pilaf is bland and mushy. The shrimp is spicy and the steak sandwich is great but only had a few slices of meat."}
{"text":"Read on Charlotte Agenda that Zoes had a good Greek salad. I gave three stars bc everything was fresh...tasteless, but fresh. I had a chicken kabob as well...yuck...it was like stewed and was just subpar. My husband had steak kabobs and a salad , not impressed at all and had no flavor. My daughter had their rice pilaf and basil lemon hummus- this was the only item with flavor. Unfortunately, we were each given three pita triangles and couldn't even finish the hummus bc we had nothing to eat it with. Skimp portions for the price as well as lack luster. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've always loved Zoe's but they recently revamped their menu and it is THAT MUCH better.  Their menu now includes whole30-approved options as well, which is very rare to find at restaurants (at least in the Phoenix area).  Food took a little while to prepare but I'll chock that up to freshness.  Prices are reasonable for the amount of food and quality ingredients. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Place used to be great.  Now they serve cut up reheated tenders instead of breast.  Chicken came out dry and cold after 15 mins, told them and they quickly brought more room temp/cold chicken. Poorly run to say the least"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Zoës fan and have been for years.  No matter which of the many Zoës locations you walk into, you know you're going to get consistently friendly service, quality Mediterranean-inspired / moderately priced cuisine, and a cheery, usually clean, environment.  This location is no exception... I've dined in a couple of times and most recently ordered a couple of family style meals to-go.  (I'm a huge fan of the family style meals by the way - highly recommend trying them if you haven't already!)  While unfortunately, my recent take-out order didn't arrive with everything it should have (it was missing sides and dressing), the manager at this location worked with me to take care of the error.  Because of that, I'll continue to be a loyal Zoës customer.  A few of my favorites: -Greek Salad with chicken -Chicken Salad -Fruit Salad -Hummus Trio -Kebabs -Spinach Roll-ups -And the new addition: Ravioli!!  Thanks Zoës... see you again real soon!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The food selection is pretty broad, with a lot of options for anyone's preferences.  There are some great healthy options like the roasted veggies, which were delicious.  As long as the standard mediterranean fare.  Service is order at the counter, with table delivery.  They were fast, friendly, and efficient.  The food was delivered within a couple minutes, even though it was lunch rush.  Everything was tasty, and as expected."}
{"text":"Okay, so I go back in yesterday and I order a chicken salad sandwich online for lunch because I could not afford to wait 30 minutes again.  I get the 5 minutes befit its scheduled to be ready (I work across the street) but it's ready, great!  I have a meeting I. 10 minutes and I'm making my way back to my office with plenty of time.  As I sit down and open my chicken salad I see its a grilled chicken sandwich with feta cheese!  As I am about to call in to my conference call someone calls me from zoës to advise of the mistake and ask if I can come back!  No, that's the point of ordering online, I don't have time to come back.  Lesson for the caller, don't ask me what you can do, just refund my money or tell me next time the chicken salad sandwich on wheat is on you.  I've never written two poor reviews about one place but they need to improve their organization in the kitchen.  Still food is great but another disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What do I eat a Greek salad for? Feta and olives, and my salad only had three little olives and surprisingly not much feta. However there was a lot of onions. I feel like a salad is a medley and this one had a strong one noted of onion.  My husband ordered the chicken salad sandwich. He said it was just all right. Nothing special, nothing bad. Bread was the best part."}
{"text":"There salmon kabobs are one of my favorite things here. Every time i bring someone to try it, their hooked. Always clean and organized."}
{"text":"Last night I place an order to be picked up. It was a salad and pita and a chicken pita. I tried to do it online and had some trouble and so I called. The girl told me to hold on while she checked to make sure the order I was attempting to place didn't go through. (It didn't). I was on hold a full 5 minutes. I should have hung up but I held and finally she comes on the line and I order my two items. I'm told 20-25 minutes so I set my time while I finish my quick shopping at Sprouts. The alarm went off as I was in line so I quickly hurried over to pick up my order. The girl looked confused as I told her my name and comes back to tell me it will be at least 15-20 more minutes. Well, all told that would be 50 minutes. Why didn't they tell me 50 minutes? I won't know if their food was good, because I wasn't waiting again, but their service was very poor. Their explanation was they had a lot of customers come in. Ok..."}
{"text":"Finally a healthy place to take my grandchildren!  I'm following The Whole 30, and it's wonderful to be able to go somewhere to eat with my grandchildren that has food that everyone likes!  I love the ice tea, grilled potato salad and veggies, and the sauces that go great with the shrimp kabobs.  Great food without the guilt.  I've been to their restaurants about 3x, and have been happy so far."}
{"text":"We get lunch at my office well, pretty much everyday. We usually stick to the reg spots, but one of the girls wanted to try this place.   I had the Greek Pita w/ the pasta salad. It was pretty big but a little difficult to eat. Especially at your desk! I have to say though the pasta salad wasn't as great as I'd hoped. My coworker raves about the slaw. I hate it, so I couldn't tell ya, but I'd take her word... Take out was a little slow, but overall, for the price and what you got, I'd say it was worth. Good place to go for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I went to Zoe's Kitchen for lunch last week & had a great meal. I ordered the chicken salad & fruit plate which was pretty big. By the time I ate the chicken salad & fruit I was so full I couldn't eat the remaining greens.   They have a ton of soup, salad, sandwich & hummus options - can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Zoe's since they opened. Got our lunch to go yesterday and I was impressed as always. Protein Power Plate is my go to, but also love the Steak Kebabs with roasted vegetables on the side. Food is always fresh and the staff is friendly. Sometimes can take longer than you would expect to get your food, but it's not too often that it's a problem. Also the desserts are all great especially the chocolate cake. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh. Truly meh. The food is edible but about as mediterranean as an iPhone. The portions are light. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a lunch.  Got the chicken Pita with hummus and it just did not look that great. It didn't really taste that great either and it was very little quantity. Probably not going to come back since there are so many choices."}
{"text":"My 11 year old daughter and I tried Zoes Kitchen for dinner tonight and while expecting an ok cafe and hoping for a quick, decent meal, were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. I had the steak roll-ups entree and the rolls were delish! There was tons of flavor in the meat and veggies, the dip was great, and I loved the pasta salad side. My daughter had the chicken roll-ups kids meal and loved it. She tried one of my rolls as well and loved the steak roll-up dip...and ended up taking the rest of the cup of dip home because she loved it so much.   I will say the portions were satisfying for us, being smaller girls, but I can imagine that any male I know or someone with a big appetite might be disappointed in just getting one entree so the price point might be high if someone has to compensate for the small portions with extra sides or dishes.   We will definitely be back and I want to try the hummus next time along with some other dishes that looked tasty."}
{"text":"So cold inside that you need a parka. Can't take wine outside due to alcohol on patio rules. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Today I got the Mediterranean chicken and the chicken roll ups. The chicken roll ups hit the spot, perfect for a light lunch. I was expecting more with Mediterranean chicken as far as quantity, but it was still delicious.  This place does a killer Postmates business. I walked in at 11 AM, and by the time I received my order, three delivery people showed up. They do not have enough room to hold their to go orders, so they put them on the tables in the dining room in the front of the counter. Not sure how they manage that during a rush.  A huge plus for this place is their outdoor patio. faces the south, so too hot in the summer, but perfect for other  times. It seems to be dog friendly. And the tables have umbrellas"}
{"text":"The power grain with lamb. Don't be fooled by the pictures they use on their menu - portion is tiny. Almost $12 later and I'm just as hungry as I was when I walked in. Kind of a rip off really. Tasted alright but then again I think frozen meals from from safeway taste alright. 2 stars because I'm a nice guy. EDIT: just read other reviews also complaining about reduced portions. Rip off CONFIRMED."}
{"text":"First time here but definitely not the last time.  Wanted something quick and healthy and this hit the spot.  I got the steak sandwich, chicken soup and pasta salad.  Left very satisfied.  Staff was very polite and friendly.  Will make this a go to place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yum! Great place to eat healthy. Super easy to avoid carbs. The hummus and steak are de-lish!"}
{"text":"It's healthy and tasty quick meal. The chicken kabobs are pretty good. They have choices for dipping sauces that are new thing. The slaw is simple and crisp. Upgrade to a Greek salad for your side."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, clean food. So good I almost couldn't wait to get pics!  Hubby ate kebabs (one chicken and one steak; I ate Mediterranean Salad Trio Bowl with lamb Kafta and Greek Tzatziki. Really really really good. Price fair for quality and quantity. Lemon cookie was a nice treat after lunch. Service was good; helpful, friendly. Were out of fresh lamb Kafta, so brought me the one left and made me new ones while I started my meal."}
{"text":"I had lunch again here the other day and I still love it. My favorite thing these days is the Rosemary Ham and Mozzarella Piadina. I got it to go with a side of their delicious slaw and I was a happy camper! I love the fact that they are quick but yet still healthy."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night for the first time. The desserts and packaged foods looked DELICIOUS.   I am picky about meat (like I don't like biting into tendons and things I don't want to eat) so the chicken kabobs were a little iffy (I bit into things I didn't want to eat), but they were seasoned well.   The rest of the food was very fresh. The greek salad that I got as a side was great!! A ton of feta cheese on mine, really clean lettuce. The side of rice was great, too.   I am gluten-free, so I had to pass on the pita bread, but that looked really good, too.   The food was a little simple for my taste, but not bad. I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of my food preferences, but others may love it.   They serve you on disposable plates and cups with plastic silverware, so it's a very simple restaurant.   Another person in my party got a chicken pita, but it looked like it was only a half pita stuffed with chicken. I personally would have wanted two halves, but I guess I eat a lot...  Worth a try once if you like fresh food, pitas, veggies and kabobs. It's a good place to stop in to try something quick and new.  Overall, good, but I prefer the restaurants around the area though- there is a Habit Burger, Five Guys, etc that I would prefer."}
{"text":"Food is fresh, well seasoned, healthy, consistent a made with pride.  Ordering was easy, cafeteria style and you place a number on you table.  The girl taking the order was friendly, professional, and offered us cups for water.  The wait for the food to be brought to the table was about 10-15 minus but worth it.    The girl who dropped off the food was in much too much of a rush, not friendly nor unfriendly, and made no eye contact. She asked if we needed anything else as she was walking away, not waiting for our answer. We did need something.  My son had a question about his kids meal, and she forget the veggies.    Great food, seriously good, hence the generous 4 stars. Poor execution of service to the table, thereby minus one star."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's kitchen! The food is fresh, healthy, inexpensive and delicious. I always get the chicken kabobs, rice pilaf and the slaw salad and use their dressing on the table for it all. They give you a ton of food and it comes out super quick as well. This restaurant whether you are going for lunch or dinner will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great Customers service and food is always delicious. Love the options they have. My favorites are the Ham and Cheese Piadina and the chicken kabobs. Healthy \"faster\" food option. Location is clean and the staff is friendly ."}
{"text":"I wish there were stars for service and food separately because I hate to give 2 stars to a place I like, but the service today was just...ugh.  First off, I like Zoe's. It's not the greatest food ever but they use a lot of feta and I love feta. I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.  Today, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice.   Will I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me.   Oh, and they didn't burn my sandwich alright. Actually (if I could take a picture I would) they barely heated it. The cheese is still mostly intact."}
{"text":"I found the service to be pretty good. And, the food (I ordered a Mediterranean Salad Trio with Lamb and a soda) was pretty good. However, what was delivered to my table, looked nothing like the picture (had slices of cucumber and meat). My bowl didn't have cucumber slices, and the lamb was formed into balls, two of which were overcooked to where the plastic knife had a hard time cutting through the bottom of them.  While tasty, I'm not sure it was worth the $10.99 price.   It's doubtful if I'll be back (mainly since it's further away than I normally travel for eating out)."}
{"text":"I like the idea of Zoes, but they just don't really execute it properly. Everything is pretty bland, and I think their only flavor profile is Feta cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like Feta...but on everything? I've been there 3 times, always hoping for the best, but I always end up having to load everything with salt and pepper to even taste it. It's overpriced for just getting a simple sandwich on store bought bread with a bag of potato chips."}
{"text":"I would have had a great first time experience here if it wasn't for the homeless guy who harassed me during my meal.  The salmon kabobs are good."}
{"text":"The place was clean and nice. I ordered the greek salad with humus, tsatziki and pita. The greek salad was plane just lettuce and a bite of feta. It had no dressing and didn't taste like anything. The humus and tsatziki were good. My husband ordered the stake sandwich which he said was fine for the price. We also ordered the moroccan chicken that was pretty well done. It was juice and melted in the mouth. 4 stars for having overall clean place with no smells, and an ok food for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen was okay. I got the Steak Kabobs with roasted vegetables and a greek salad to go. The Kabobs were very overly charred but the veggies and the salad was pretty good. The restaurant looks very clean and the staff is nice. Unfortunately, the food is just not that great."}
{"text":"As a regular customer of this location, I was very dissatisfied with Saturdays service. Orders were mixed up with some of us not getting what was ordered. Extremely slow service. The dishrack for the silverware was plopped for customers to help themselves. Half orders were done. Extremely short staffed,  hibiscus tea not made. While I enjoy the food, I hope this isn't a trend for them."}
{"text":"The employees here are super sweet and the food not bad at all. I had the shrimp kabobs and hummus trio. I liked my food and ate most of it. The only thing that bothered me is that I placed a to go order at the same time I ordered but I had plans to dine there. After eating, they still did not have my to go order ready. They were extremely apologetic and gave us free cookies for the inconvenience. I would come back if I ever am craving quick Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Great lunch place! The protein plate is my favorite. Recently we had the new baked feta appetizer which was very tasty. It had feta, cherry tomatoes, basil, black olives and olive oil and was served with pita chips. Healthy and quick!!"}
{"text":"Had the best first experience here. I decided to try Zoe's Kitchen out for my first time and ordered the Chicken Pita Pizza. I informed the cashier that I had never been here and she certainly was friendly and welcoming. In fact, the entire staff were just was warm. My pita pizza was pretty darn good, and upon giving me my to-go order I was handed a complementary cookie for the wait. Which that too was absolutely delicious. They are good people over at this location. I will be returning next time I am back on this end of town!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is such a nice place, I go there mainly for the light and the pleasant atmosphere rather than the food. Great place for a casual lunch, a little on the expensive side, but their Greek salad sampler is to die for.  Those soda cups are mighty small though and I always have to come back to fill up. Double the size would be perfect."}
{"text":"I needed a place to cater an event for my work and upon my search for \"boxed lunches  that deliver,\" I found Zoes. I didn't want to give folks a typical sandwich boxed lunch and needed something that would appease carnivores, gluten free folks and vegans alike and I feel like Zoes Kitchen was perfect. Working with their sales manager Marissa made the whole process super easy. Their boxed lunches were great! I went with chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs and chicken green salads and was so impressed with the presentation. Delivery and set up was great! The delivery girls did have a spill and 2 veggie kabobs didnt make it but I appreciated that they were honest about it and I was refunded. Zoes had no problem in individually packaging all 110 of my orders. They even brought along some nifty coolers with ice for drinks and all of the necessary paperware/plasticware. They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good! The chicken was flavorful, the salad was refreshing. I was also very happy that I decided to order some of their cookies because they were such a big hit! Everyone at the event raved about the food, so I definitely know who to call the next time I have an event in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love love love love love love this place.  I don't think their food is bland at all.  I work nearby, so this is my main lunch choice.  I call in my order which is usually the Grilled Chicken plate and it's ready to be picked up in 10 minutes.  It does get crowded for lunch which is why I get it to go.  They even have To Go parking, so that's a plus!  Now the food!  Yummy!  Their grilled chicken is seasoned and cooked perfect every time.  They grill up some onions with it too which are heavenly!  I used to get their greek salad and add chicken which is a $2 add on, so this salad ends up costing almost $10, but I discovered a secret!  If you get the grilled chicken plate, it's basically the same thing (lil less salad, but you still get the side of your choice) and it only costs $8.  I recommend: -Ya Ya's chocolate cake is unbelievable! -The chicken salad sandwich is great! -For sides, I usually get the coleslaw, fruit, or the rice. -Chicken roll ups rock -Any of the pitas -Pita pizza is so original, filling, and delish! -Homemade limeade - there are no words for this drink, it's so good, you just have to try it!  Not worth it: -Pasta side is bland (but sometimes I get it and mix it in with my salad, yum) -The mediterranean tuna left me too stinky for work hours -Orzo soup was bland -The turkey is just deli slices of processed meat (not great compared to the chicken)  You can specialize anything on their menu too and they will get it perfect.  I have only  had 2 messed up orders the whole time I've been eating here.  The first time they forgot my side so they delivered a whole pint of it (they sell just the sides three too) to my work when they were on their way to deliver a catering order.  And they brought me a free chocolate cake to say they were sorry!  The second time, they forgot my salad dressing (which they also bottle and sell).  So I called to let them know, didn't have time on my lunch to run back, so they comp'd my meal for the next time... even my limeade!  Great customer service, food, and variety keeps me coming back to Zoe's!  They take care of their customers and the environment with the refillable cups they recently started.  Only $1 for refills!  Love it!  Did I say I love this place already?"}
{"text":"Friendly and food is great. Some of the workers aloof and distracted. Overall excited to have Zoe's nearby!"}
{"text":"I live very close by to this Zoe's and go here a lot.  A LOT.  Like, embarrasingly a lot.  And it's always for lunch, and I always order to-go, and I always order the same exact thing, the same exact way:  Greek salad, no olives, no potato salad, extra red onions.  I used to have a problem where I'd get home and find chicken added to it (a no-no for a vegetarian like me), but I haven't had that issue in about a year.  Nonetheless, I check it while I'm still there every time to make sure.  The salad is big and tasty (especially without those nasty olives or unnecessary potato salad glob at the bottom), and I feel like it's pretty healthy and low calorie.  The service is nice and pretty efficient, even during weekday lunch rush when it's a real challenge to find parking and maneuver around the lot without getting hit.  They don't even embarrass me about coming so often and ordering the same exact thing, haha.  The one thing I can say as a critique- they could be a bit more consistent on their salads.  Sometimes there is a ton of something, like lettuce or feta, and other times it's challenging to find it at all.  This place is solid."}
{"text":"After several negative experiences, I was given several free lunch passes to Zoes, so I figured, what the hey? Might as well enjoy a free meal and see if there have been improvements made. I called and placed a to-go order, which was the same item I always get, the tuna salad sampler. When you call Zoes, they have your phone number in their computer, which tells the person answering what you typically order. So I go into the restaurant, impressed by the new look of Zoes. The floors and tables were clean (Awesome!) and they have new furniture, which has created a warmer feeling in the dining room. The girl who took my order and cashed me out was pleasant and very excited about my free lunch coupon. She was endearing. I left the restaurant with a smile on my face! I get back to work and open the box and...it was the wrong menu item. SNAP. I was so excited. I call back and let them know I was returning to get the correct menu item. When I returned to Zoes, the women who I believe to be the manager, barely grunted at me while handing me my food. No sorry, no please excuse the inconvenience, no nothing. So, A-OK."}
{"text":"This is easily the most disorganized, dirty Zoe's I've ever been in. All of the employees seems sweaty and unkempt. The restaurant is always dirty, tables not wiped down and it isn't uncommon to see flies all over the place.  In terms of the food, the salmon kabobs are ok but the white beans are usually runny. Every time I've gotten white beans, I had to ask it it were beans or soup.  I like the Zoes franchise and have been to locations all across the country and have never seen a location like this. Take into account the parking is absolutely horrendous and the trip to this Zoes simply isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I usually order from this store through grubhub. They get something wrong almost EVERY time. I decided to go to yelp this time because of their stupidity and refusal to correct it. It's simple, I ordered potato salad and I got chicken salad. But they had the nerve to put a \"potato salad\" label on it. At first, I thought it was tuna salad, they look the same...when I told the store this, they refused to refund me because \"we only sell potato and chicken salad\". OK WHATEVER, I obviously didn't get potato salad, so give me a freaking refund!! This store sucks consistently.  Update: Zoes Kitchen never resolved this, despite posting their bogus comment. Sent an email and didn't hear a thing back."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Greek/Mediterranean healthy salad/pita/ lunch spot!!!! I got this chicken with Caramelized mushrooms and Greek salad and pita. But the real MVP here was the white beans. Omg. I don't even know what these were or what was in them but they were so good I am still dreaming about them. So whatever you order, make sure you get them!!!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen is awesome, tasty, & healthy convenience food! I've only been to this Zoe's location once so far, but have no doubt I will frequent it more often in the months to come. This one is so much larger than the Downtown Scottsdale location and features orange and yellow colors for it's aesthetics, which I found to give it a very welcoming feel. I had been driving by this restaurant often. From a distance, the exterior is misleading. I was surprised it was much bigger than I expected when I walked in. During my visit, I had the Mediterranean Chicken, which came with a salad, pita bread sliced in wedges (not toasted), & a white bean dip (or soup). I really loved it and I loved how healthy and light it was. Sitting outside in the patio on a Sunday afternoon in the cool January weather was also perfect!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I liked Zoe's.  I used to come here all the time but just stopped for some reason.... now I'll put it back on to the \"usual\" list for sure.  The \"Grüben\" grilled turkey sandwich on rye is super delicious, and I can't get enough of the feta coleslaw, though the pasta salad w/ basil is really tasty too.  I noticed they've added braised white beans as a side option which is intriguing; can't wait to try them!  The service is always ridiculously fast; which is a plus for a 'fast/casual' type place.   The chocolate sheet cake is super yummy and reminds me of the cakes my grandma used to make.  You always get bonus points for reminding me of my grandmother. :)"}
{"text":"Great and healthy alternative to the usual suspects. The Mediterranean pita was very big. My chix salad sandwich was delic. Everything is very fresh and worth a try."}
{"text":"The prices keep us from being regulars, but just heard about their rewards program: get the app, scan every receipt of $7 or more for a treat every time. Receipt this time was $6 :(  Will try it next time.   Pros: great fresh and healthy food. We get the basil pesto hummus with warm pita to tide us over before dinner. Staff is always super friendly. Free wifi. Bright and cheerful.   Cons: a little pricey and no charging stations, a little isolated"}
{"text":"Always a great choice for healthy clean eats! I had the special menu grilled chicken slaw pita with side Greek salad. My wife had the new quinoa salad. Outstanding"}
{"text":"I went here despite Yelpers telling me not to bother.  What did I get?  An overpriced, bland sandwich, confusion at the menu, and feeling awkward in the location.    It's an uppity cafeteria that makes you want to believe that their food is good for you, but it's not. Don't make the same mistake I did!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat, the food is always cooked perfectly and tastes great. Just had the Chicken Kabobs with Humus instead of salad, and it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Zoe's is a place I normally go when I come to the area to visit the parents. There aren't any near my current neck of the woods....but today soured me on the place or at least the one that's most convenient to my parents' house.   Despite an efficient exchange with the cashier (older woman), I then waited close to 20 minutes as the young man immediately in front of me was quickly served his food and then an elderly couple who came in after me was served theirs. Then I flagged the woman over and pointed outs I was waiting-she asked are you dining in? I have a number and a ticket clearly stating I'm a dine in. She then has a loud conversation with the young man cooking who apparently needs her to confirm everything written on my ticket.   My food comes out at same time as woman who came in 15 minutes after me. I'm starting and eat my vegetables first-a little cold (which is odd since this is supposedly freshly prepared)but sill good. Then I eat the kebabs-cold, under seasoned, and half cooked. My starvation (first meal of day at 330 pm due to poor timing on my part) led me to push through but as the undercooked shrimp rumbles in my stomach I'm regretting it already. Bad service, badly prepared food-Zoe's do better."}
{"text":"Anytime I can get out of the office to get lunch, I go to Zoe's.  Great array of fresh and mostly healthy meals.  LOVE the chicken salad and the (not so healthy) chocolate cake.  Staff are friendly, service is quick, food is consistent which is the best recipe for an successful work lunch."}
{"text":"We don't have a Zoe's close to where we live, so any time I'm in Huntersville around lunch or dinner I plan my visit.  I am disappointed by the service - namely the immaturity of the staff running the place this evening. They were yelling and goofing off and creating a scene in the restaurant.  I received my Greek Salad with the shrimp kabob add-on that cost an additional $3.39. This price afforded me only three small shrimp and a few shriveled up vegetables.  On top of that- I had to ask the staff to provide me with the pita points that I knew went with the salad. Apparently, the staff either didn't know that or they hoped I wouldn't notice!  After I had already asked for the pita, I had to go to the counter to ask the staff member if she was going to bring it to me.  The salad was mostly lettuce with very little vegetables added.  Expensive salad for leaves and 3 tiny shrimp!  Unfortunately, like most restaurants that start out with rave reviews and good reputation, Zoe's is providing less than stellar service and serving less than expected meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years and we have watched the staff get lazier and lazier. I can't tell you how many times we have called in take out and get the order home and something is missing or not correct. Then- when you call to let them know they don't apologize (this has happened several times). The most recent time the girl working the register asked \"so, what would you like me to do?\". Well, I would like for you to tell me you will make the chicken that is missing from my salad that COMES WITH CHICKEN. In the past when we go in to get what was left out of the order the staff makes me feel very uncomfortable with strange grins on their faces... it makes you feel like they have done something to your food. Not once have they given a sincere apology. We're done going here. The staff is super sketchy and they don't care at all about the customer experience. I would not call in take out to this location ever again and because of the way it has played out in the past I don't even want to give them my business again."}
{"text":"Came at 11:30 with two friends so we missed the lunch rush that came in after us. I had the quinoa salad while my friends had kabobs, one chicken and one steak. The quinoa salad lacked flavor. While I didn't taste the chicken kabob, the steak kabob was amazing. Excellent flavor on the steak. We also had the hummus trio and the pesto basil was my favorite of the three. More than anything, the service was fantastic. The girl who took our order was friendly, knowledgeable, and very personable. The guy that delivered our food was also incredibly nice and came in to check on us afterwards."}
{"text":"Had salmon entree which had small salad and hummus. Good value, very clean, bright, and spacious place.   Good vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"Zoes is a great alternative to traditional unhealthy fast food options.  The restaurant has a Greek infulenced menu.  In addition to the great sandwich and kabob options, the sides are offerings such as greek salad, hummus, white beans.  Great for a nice, light lunch!  Located just around the corner from Qdoba and down the street from the movie theatre."}
{"text":"I like Zoe's Kitchen. I even tried to put the umlaut above the O in \"Zoe\" but alas, I lack that sort of NASA-grade training.   An assortment of sandwiches, sides and salads are on hand for the taking. Well, you can't just take them... you have to pay, of course. I don't want to be blamed when a rash of sandwich robberies breaks out along the McDowell corridor... but I've gotten off on a tangent again.  I've only ever tried the Gruben. I think I need an umlaut there too. No? We're good? Good. Like a Reuben but with fresh cabbage and turkey. Much healthier, and with a tangy kick. A good quick place to grab a sandwich during your lunch break.  Zoe's sides are available by the pound (chicken, potato, pasta, tuna and egg salads). They will cater your next event and if you've ever seen those Honda Elements running around Phoenix with Zoe's name plastered along the sides, you know that they deliver. Or maybe you're under the impression that those cars are actually mobile kitchens. Well, that's just silly."}
{"text":"Ordered a family meal deal to go on their app.  It was ready when I got there and  I took it home.  When I got home,  I noticed my order was incorrect. I called and when I spoke to the manager, he was super helpful and went above and beyond to make things right.  The food was delicious and I will certainly be a repeat customer with customer service like that!"}
{"text":"This is typically my go to if I want to eat out, get full, and still be healthy while not breaking my wallet. They have great options for all."}
{"text":"One of the few places where the food you get actually looks just like the pictures on the menu! Always delish & fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed my quinoa salad with a side of braised white beans - excellent flavor! Good service, clean facility. Free wifi is always a good addition."}
{"text":"Best food...The hummus tasted so fresh and tasty. Spinach roll ups were good as well."}
{"text":"What a lovely addition to the hustle and bustle or Birkdale. Zoë's is fairly new to Huntersville and it is getting good word of mouth so we visited for lunch on Tuesday w/our boys; they do a nice lunch business, not too crowded but seats were getting full when we left and people were calling in To Go orders.  Upon arrival you walk into a bright dining area w/funky light fixtures, modern asthetic, welcoming pillows on bench seats all mixed with art by local kids. It's kinda Panera meets Ikea. This casual environment may give you a false sense of financial security, but be warned, the prices are more in line w/a sit down restaurant like Chili's or Longhorn. However, the food is far healthier and the prices are justified.  My husband had salmon kabobs served w/cucumber salad, a big portion of greek salad, hummus and pita. The salmon was plentiful, big chunks perfectly seared, nicely seasoned and skewered w/zucchini.   I ordered the chicken kabobs and when they arrived, the smell transported me back to the greek kitchens I grew up around. The plate was half covered in a light, fresh greek salad and half covered in rice pilaf w/kabobs and pita atop. The chicken was very tender, mildly flavored and veggies perfectly grilled. Rice pilaf had a nice texture and subtle flavor. Feta on the salad was perfect - not all salt.   The boys shared a grilled chicken/mozzarella wrap served w/their choice of side and a nice, tomato based dipping sauce. They both ate lots and loved their FUZE pinapple banana drink.  The grand total for these three meals was $31 - a bit surprising on your first visit since you order at a counter, but they serve you and bus the tables. The staff is very outgoing and helpful. We left very satisfied, bellies full, looking forward to another visit for a light and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Russ suggested My Florist for lunch since we were in the area, but I said, \"well I always go there at night and while sitting at My Florist, see this cute little lunch place across the street that I've been wanting to try, so let's go there.\"   It's good for a quick lunch and an alternative to fast food (anything is better than the F food).  I got the chicken feta pita, it was okay, kinda boring.  I think I liked the design of the place better than the food. So, ++ for good marketing and design, now if they'd do something more interesting with the menu :)"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the Mediterranean Tuna Pita, and Greek Side Salad. As usual, the food was good, but the portions were a bit on the small side. Honestly, I'm inclined to go elsewhere for Mediterranean food at a better price."}
{"text":"I went to Zoe's Kitchen today for lunch and ordered the Ham & Swiss grilled sandwich. My first experience with Zoe's was mediocre, but this time was much better. There was a lot on the menu to order, but I was in the mood for something with flavor but simple. It definitely hit the spot. I work downtown and it was quick, there was seating available, but a lot of people there, and parking was much better than Pei Wei (right across the street)."}
{"text":"Manager was super friendly and accommodating during our visit. Food tastes amazing, fresh and very filling. The family meal is a crowd pleaser for sure and the Chocolate cake is a must-have. The staff worked hard and seemed to flow well together. Restaurant very clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch & the Trio Bowl was really good. Big portions too so you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Per request from community manager, I emailed the provided address on 8/4. It's 8/16, no response... interesting."}
{"text":"Dirty.  Kitchen, floors, bathroom, tables.  Would benefit from a good manager.  Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"The food is very good and always fresh and consistent. They have many different fresh and healthy food options. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I like Zoe's.  It's nothing super exciting but it's healthy and tasty fast-ish food.  I typically get the chicken kabobs and went with the greek chicken pita this last time.  I'd recommend sticking to the platters/kabobs as the pita lacked in the meat department but was still pretty good.  The desserts are solid and large enough to split.    If you're watching calories or dining with a someone you want to make feel self-conscious there's a sub-500 calorie menu that still provides a good sized portion."}
{"text":"I'm TOO HOT for ya!!!! I saw the Fireman#Captain to be exact sittin' behind me at Zoe's. I noticed as I was leaving! Hahaha. As Bruno Mars says in his Uptown Funk song, \"I'm too HOT for ya!\" Hahaha! \"EVERYWHERE I GO they be like......\"#That was also a line from Bruno Mars! I see Firemen everywhere I go; especially in food places; but this is the 1st time I saw the Captain! Lol. I guess when it comes to dancin' I'm the Captain! I'll show my dance partner just what to do! Uhh Huh! Let me show him that 1 2 step!  About the FOOD though! It's the Mediterranean bomb! Hahahaha. My fav is the Rosemary ham & Mozzarella Piadina! Bombness! It's full of flavor! It comes with a side & I chose rice pilaf!#De-lish! Another fav is the chicken salad & feta cheese coleslaw! They both are so flavorful!  The lime-aid with pure sugar can is island-licious!#So refreshing & flavorful! Ya ta's home-Adecco chocolate cake is the bomb as well! The cooks are good! (That was short for cookies) i usually get chocolate chip, but I saw a new lemon, & I picked it because it was so soft! I haven't tried it yet!  Bekah was really sweet! She went above & beyond and showed excellent customer service like putting ice in my cup for the lime-aid!  All the staff are friendly & helpful! I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband for the first time.  It was good and quick.  It's decent for an Americanized middle eastern meal."}
{"text":"I am a loyal  customer at the Midtown Zoe's but was out this way to do a little shopping and decided to stop by. I usually get the Shrimp Kabobs or the Spinach Roll ups. I decided on the Shrimp Kabobs to go ,  as usual the food was delicious ! I did notice that they included tomatoes in their salads, I don't remember the midtown one having tomatoes. They also include to lemon wedges  - it may be because I ordered my food to go but I have never seen lemon wedges included . They were a nice addition to squeeze over my shrimp and rice! It's a little smaller than the other location but they have a nice patio. There is parking across the street in the movie theater lot , but I wonder where you would park if the movie theater lot was full.  If you are a regular at Zoes be sure to download the app. Upload a picture of your receipt and you will receive a \"goodie\" , so far I have received free hummus and pita, a free drink, and best one of all a free full entrée! Just make sure that you get an itemized receipt not one of the black to go ones."}
{"text":"Daniella is amazing! I go there almost every day and they always have such smiling faces and greet me right away , they always have my order delicious and on time ! I would recommend them to everyone who wants a healthy alternative to  fast , fresh food"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, food that is prepared fast. Couldn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Always friendly staff, super delicious salads and chicken kabobs. Would recommend to all!!!"}
{"text":"I need to let everyone know what horrible service I received at the chandler zoës a few moments ago. It's a simple complaint but one that has me vowing never to return to this location. I want to add I'm not a one in a while customer to zoës as I have 85 check-in's at the McDowell and 7th Av. location and have been a huge fan of zoës since the day they first came to town years ago. I simply wanted to substitute another item instead of the mushrooms to the vegetable kabob dinner as I've done many many times in the past with no problems. Not today as the girl working the register told me that the kabobs are premade and she couldn't substitute another vegetable in place of the mushrooms. I asked for the manager and he was basically an asshole and didn't won't to help me with my predicament either. I have been a super loyal customer on my personal time and an even better customer with sending my business clients zoës to their offices on a regular basis. That was until my horrible experience today. Goodbye zoës"}
{"text":"This is probably the LONGEST I have waited for a TO GO order. 40 minutes. The staff was completely disengaged and too busy flirting to care about my order.   The manager sent the 16 year employee to talk to me (who probably should be the manger - he was the hardest working person there) and he offered me a free meal. The manager then told him to write my name in some sketchy book and shoved it in a drawer.  If I were the owner or regional I would spend more time here and watch the staff more closely.  I did give one star because the food wasn't 1/2 bad but they did forget 1 side and all the sauce. ?"}
{"text":"This a great spot.  Get here before the lunch rush or after.  If not parking is a disaster.  The chicken pita pizza is amazing.  It comes with a salad and it is a great deal.  It's my favorite here.  I cannot give it 5 stars due to the debacle that is the parking situation."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place:) totally in love with service, food and their smart colorful decor. American Greek food is fast and extremely delicious. Their speciality oils/dressing for Greek salad is exotic. A big cheers to Rachel Zoe and I think more of these should open up for everyone to try it out ! Waiting for it in California !!!"}
{"text":"Took the family there after walking around Birkdale Village. We were there on a Sunday evening and it was not busy.  You order at the counter and they bring you the food. We had the chicken souvlakis. The food was good and tasted fresh but it didn't strike me as anything special though. The portions were good too. I believe that to standout in this business, you need to serve something unique so the customer wants to return soon.  That is what separates the 3 star places from the 4 and 5 star restaurants."}
{"text":"I parked next to the curb side pickup sign after I placed my order online and called the restaurant to let them know I was there like the sign says to do. No answer on the phone while the manager and cashier were just staring out the window at my car. No employees came out to see what my name is for the order or anything. I saw my order on the counter but continued to wait in my car and look at the manager just to see how long it would take.... lol I gave up after 10 min and just parked my car and walked in. The 20 foot walk was obviously no big deal but don't have a curbside pick up if your not going to use it."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't go back. I got the chicken pita and Greek salad. Everything seemed fresh but just bland. There was no flavor to anything. The Greek salad came with two olives and one half of a cherry tomato, the dressing honestly just tasted like olive oil, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper and that didn't help enough. The chicken pita was also very bland, the pita was hard and tzatziki sauce also had no flavor, just tasted like plain Greek yogurt in the pita. Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for while now and I got to give them credit they are accommodating . they once got my order wrong and just gave me about 40 dollars of extra food. But anyways this is favorite spot on the McDowell and 7 ave food selection area. The food always taste fresh, the people are always nice and its not to expensive. Personal favorites the chicken roll up with white beans so good. I also like all the he kabobs. I feel like a good meal with cost 10 dollars usually, the wait time after ordering isn't to long  10 to 15 minutes after logging. It good chain and I recommend it especially if you want to see some green added to your diet."}
{"text":"First time here. Delicious food with fresh ingredients. Perfect for folks watching carbs.  I got shrimp kabobs, grilled perfectly, not too done. Hubs got the cauliflower rice bowl (I was too scared because it was served cold), it was delicious! Highly recommend. Fantastic iced tea as well!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mom after seeing it on my last trip to Phoenix, but I had run out of time to try it.  It is a very popular spot.  If it's not super hot outside, there is a patio with misters.  My mom and I ordered a baked feta for an appetizer to share.  She got the steak kabobs, and I had the spinach rolls with Greek salad.  I really enjoyed the baked feta with the cherry tomatoes baked with it and baked pita on the side.  The spinach rolls were good; I didn't think the dipping sauce worked well with them -- it was too much like salsa.  I tried the steak kabobs and broccoli, they were pretty good.  The broccoli wasn't over cooked, and it was seasoned well.  The Greek Salad comes dressing free, and there is a bottle of the Greek salad dressing on the table.  I smelled it, and it smelled good.  I put it on my salad, but towards the end of it, my tongue was burning, and I couldn't finish the last few pieces of lettuce.  I don't know if it triggered an old medical problem I had with my tongue from before that makes me super sensitive to spice and/or acid, but I couldn't finish the salad -- it hurt me too much.  I LOVE vinegar, so it's usually not a problem.  Overall, it was OK.  I have other Mediterranean places I like more."}
{"text":"I've only been to this restaurant (& this location) once. I've been wanting to try it for a long time, but I just never got around to it. I happened to be working in the area, and tried it out. Unfortunately, it was also during lunch rush. My co-worker and I placed orders to go. Nothing crazy - she ordered two pitas, and I ordered the Cauliflower Rice Bowl with Lamb Kafta. We waited over 20 minutes for our take our order. The Lamb Kafta meatballs was a little overcooked for my liking, but flavor was good. The bowl overall was delicious, and the Israeli Skhug, very good. I would definitely come back for the food, but maybe order ahead or not go during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Place is nice staff is friendly, the food was ok, presentation was nice but food was bland. Who says there Mediterranean type food but no garlic?"}
{"text":"I ordered two items from this location tonight through DoorDash. Greek salad - one of Zoes' signature items that arrived without potato salad. The one ingredient that makes this salad unique. I added a side of falafel, which according to the DoorDash menu, should have been four not three.  Is it really that difficult to get one salad and a side of falafel correct? WOW."}
{"text":"I gotta say I was skeptical to eat clean and healthy for lunch ad most places are bland and a bit disappointing.  I arrived with friends and wasn't sure what to order but the employee was very nice and offered some suggestions. They were not snobby they were very polite and patient as I browsed the menu.   I ordered the chicken kebabs with rice pilaf and a salad. The kebabs had large pieces of grilled chicken and were lightly seasoned. My fave part about the kebabs were the cherry tomatoes as they were roasted. The salad was fresh and crunchy. They have house dressing on every table. It's a light vinaigrette blend which added more juiciness to the meal. I think I paid a total of $12 for my plate which was so filling and a slice of their house chocolate cake to go."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my soup and salad. Not the best, but way better option than fast food. I had a chicken orzo soup and Greek salad for $8.  Paleo and whole 30 compliant so, I'm in!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken salad and hummus.  I love getting them to go to keep in the fridge as snacks."}
{"text":"For a quick service restaurant the food was very fresh and flavorful.   We got the chicken parmigan for 4.  Salad was great, chicken was flavorful and orzo was just right.  Service was quick.  Staff was very pleasant.  Overall great experience at Zoes."}
{"text":"I think this place is an OK addition to the Birkdale restaurant scene.  The food is very good, especially the salad and greek dressing.  However, I don't think you get the best bang for your buck with the food portions.  With Qdoba and Brixx right down the sidewalk, you can spend the same and get much more at the same quality.  If this place would drop their prices $0.50 - $1.00, then you could expect a line out the door every day.  But as it stands, the price point is just off and I think people know it.  The interior of the restaurant is awesome - great colors and overall modern scheme.   The menu is just diverse enough to make you come back every now and then to try something new.    With the good food and slightly high prices, I average this out to a 3 star establishment."}
{"text":"Zoe's gets a 2 star review.  Their food is great (worthy of 4 or 5 stars), which is the only reason I am giving them 2 stars.  Their service is awful at lunch time, which rates zero stars.    Zoe's get behind right out of the chute.  I work within walking distance of the store.  I order online, at least an hour in advance, and they are normally 20 minutes late on their promised pick up time.  They also rarely get my take out order right the first time, which leads to more waiting.  This particular location has had several (I think three) managers in the last year.  I do not profess to be an expert in the restaurant business, but the results tend to indicate that they have a process failure rather than a person failure (i.e., their kitchen system sucks or their hiring system sucks).    I sincerely hope that Zoe's figures it out.  Their success at this location (they are always busy at lunch) exists in spite of their poor service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Zoes Kitchen. I've been to several locations and everything on the menu is tasty. It's right on my way home from the gym, so I used to stop here about 11:15--prior to the lunch rush--and pick up a Protein Power Plate and a Diet Coke. For the past year or so, this location has been MESSED UP. It takes FOREVER. You wait in line forever, once you order it takes at least 20 minutes to get your food, and then most of the time it's wrong. I've ordered family style to go orders that have been wrong as well. I wrote to Zoes' management and got ZERO response. I have worked for retail/restaurant customer service a good portion of my career, and let me tell you...they better get this fixed and soon. Last two times I've checked it out to see if anything had improved (today), I ended up walking out."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place more so than Panera. The sandwiches are packed tight and they aren't skimpy. The hibiscus green tea is good too..price wise it's not cheap for lunch (to me anyway) but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Waited 30 minutes after ordering for lunch. When I asked the staff when it might be up I was nonchalantly advised 'we're backed up '. There were 4 in our party and the orders did not arrive together. When the first one came out we asked again about the others and the server who by the look on her face had zero interest in being there said 'we're backed up'. When the rest of the orders finally arrived, 2 were incomplete. We asked Ms. Personality about it and she kind of rolled her eyes, sighed and walked back to the counter. She did eventually come back with the rest of the orders and pretty much dropped them on the table. I took this opportunity to ask her name to which she replied 'Lisette'... I am very disappointed at the poor customer service and long wait at this location and won't be back."}
{"text":"Build your own Mediterranean. My friend and I ordered online (pick up only). Food was all ready when I got there. No wait just handed me my food in a drive through lane meant for  pick up only orders! (awesomeness).   I was very disappointed in what I got but I know I was pushing it with getting fruit and a scoop of chicken salad. It wasn't bad just very boring. I also got a free hummus for signing up for the eclub. I got the coupon instantly when signing up. I got the basil pesto hummus which was really good and had a lot of flavor.   My friend got a greek chicken pita and roasted potatoes. I know for sure the potatoes were really good.   I definitely will try again but will for sure get mediterranean type food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, pretty healthy, Very disconnected service seemed to be way more attentive to their To/Go Orders than me dining inside. After 30 minutes & everyone behind me getting food delivered I inquired to discover they lost my order.  Nothing was done to show remorse, meal was not comped or anything.  With Table Tags how does this happen? If I was the Manager I would have comped the meal to get me to return for a second visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great healthy low carb choices of great food! The salmon kabobs are my favorite!  Their dressing is fantastic! The food is always fresh! Many salad choices. I can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"I am trying to embrace the fast, fresh, and healthy concept.  My first attempt was the chicken pita and although I have no doubt it is healthy (healthier) I didn't get enough flavor to stick to that.  Not to be deterred I tried the steak kebabs.  I wish I had started with these kebabs.  I yearn for lamb or goat but the steak is tasty.  I like the macaroni salads bold basil and strong black pepper, although it is more than some would tolerate.  I need to try some more items before I can decide to keep the 3 star or push this place to 4 stars.  The goodies you get for taking a picture of your receipt are alright but nothing to go crazy over.  Sides and drinks mostly.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  And the place is very clean.  It is halfway between 3 and 4, so depending on my mood and the weather this could be a 4.  This is all thanks to the management giving me a gift certificate to try this place again when I would have otherwise written it off.  Well played."}
{"text":"Very tasty and healthy food. Visited 3 times and was very pleased with the food and service!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and bright flavors lots of options . Chicken very tender and tasty. I had the Med. Trio Bowl w/ chicken"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Mediterranean style food, very fresh. Have tried the quinoa salad, steak kabobs, hummus, and chicken salad, everything I've eaten there so far is delicious. So happy they opened up right by my work!"}
{"text":"Whoops, I thought this location just opened up...but I guess I just never went down McDowell for anything.   Anyway, I fall into the category of people who think the food induces yawning. I had the Greek Pita and there was nothing Greek about it. My chicken, though, was NOT dry at all...quite tasty by itself in fact. See, its not that the food here doesn't taste good, its just that its nothing special...a sandwich packed in your lunchbox is just as good as what I had here. This wrap tasted like the thousands of others I've had. (that's right, thousands)   I didn't read reviews before I went, and I did it on purpose. Its right down the street, they serve sandwiches, so I had decided that this is a place that I will find something to like about. Another place to add to my wall-of-menus. But...I will visit 2 more times for a total of 3. 3 strikes and you're out is fair, right?   On the plus side, even though the food was boring, it was still fresh. And if you scratch the dressing, it'll be healthy. But likewise if you scratch the dressing....you might fall asleep while eating."}
{"text":"We have a tradition of getting carryout on Saturday night, usually sandwiches or something fairly light  So we have a rotation that includes Pei Wei, China Chili, Whataburger, My Florist, Quizno's, sometimes delivery from Z Pizza.  Within that context Zoe's is a win.  The chicken salad and tuna salad sandwiches are tasty and of generous size.  My wife likes the marinated slaw, I prefer the potato salad.  Parking is never a problem, orders that are phoned in are ready when promised.   Note that although the menu has sandwich plus side plus chips for a price, you can ask for just the sandwich and they will sell it to you for a cheaper unpublished price."}
{"text":"What a great place!  I work nearby and have been to Zoe's two times this week.  The staff is always so nice and friendly...and the food is great!  I am definitely a fan of this place and would recommend it to anyone.  I also like that they have dinners for four \"to go.\"  I will most definitely be trying them out, as my husband and I are always working late and don't have time to cook.  Love the healthy options too!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am being kind with the 2 star rating. This places only saving grace is the marinade they smother everything in.  The steak kebab's had the chewiest meat I have ever encountered at a Mediterranean eatery.  The vegetables did not taste or look fresh and were slathered with way too much marinade.   The so called seasonal fruit was a joke. Almost $3.00 for a few cut up pieces of sub par fruit.  Too much money for what was a terrible terrible terrible meal.  Skip this place and hitup one of the other 30 eateries in a 1 block radius."}
{"text":"Zoe, why does your grilled cheese sandwich taste so bad? There aren't that many ingredients to mess up; It's only cheese and bread with tomato and lettuce! I liked the rye bread and the buttery toasted taste of it, but the cheese itself was less than pleasant. While I enjoyed the pimento which gave it a spicy kick, the actual cheese didn't taste that great. Adding to the cheese problem was the fact that they did not melt the shredded cheese fully, so when I received it, it looked like a pre-chewed, coagulated, half-melted mess. Since it was only half melted it was lukewarm temperature-wise. I don't know about you but I don't know anyone who likes eating less-than-hot grilled cheese sandwiches that look like the aftereffect of a toddler's bad stomach day. I actually scraped all the cheese off the bread and thought it was better eating bread, lettuce, and tomato rather than the original sandwich.  The saving grace was the side and the friendly service. The braised white beans were nicely seasoned with a hint of smokiness and just the right amount of rosemary. The beans themselves were perfectly tender. I also had a hibiscus green iced tea with my order which was refreshing, caffeine free, and had good flavor.  I was torn between giving them a 2 or a 3 star, but the more I think about it, the more I think this is the worst grilled cheese sandwich I've had (The ones I made in my dorm room years ago with Kraft Singles tasted better!). So, I'll have to downgrade.  Edit: So I looked up pimento cheese sandwich online- people really enjoy eating chewed up looking bits of cheese in a sandwich? Regardless, the sandwich still didn't taste great to me even though the texture is supposed to be that way."}
{"text":"Being a Floridian, I had never heard of Zoe's but my fiance suggested we try it while visiting Charlotte and I can see why. They have a wide variety of options on the menu and much of it is relatively healthy while still tasting good.  I ordered the lean turkey pita and was pleased with it including the quality of the turkey. My fiance ordered a salad and it was enormous. She got a full meal out of it for dinner that night and there was enough left over for both of us to have it for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I've only tried Zoe's once before (the Metropolitan locale) and unfortunately had such an unpleasant experience with the food I vowed I'd never go again. Well never say never since I attended a meeting recently that was catered by Zoe's. Boy did this place make me eat my words (pun intended) . I absolutely adored the veggie kabobs! We did get to try chicken too but they weren't nearly as good as the veggies were huge and perfectly marinated. The rice, salad dressing, and even the chocolate chip cookie were also quite delicious. This was much healthier than the standard meeting catered lunch so  I am happy to report that I will be back soon and this time I'll know what to get!"}
{"text":"Oh my gaw! A friend of mine turned me on to this place and I must say, it is the very best of Birkdale. The ingredients are the absolute freshest and bestest :)   I've been here a number of times and have only tried the Tossed Greek salad which is absolutely amazing!! But on my most recent visit, I ventured out and got the grilled pimento cheese sandwich. It's been quite a few years since I've had pimento cheese but this was really good,and a unique twist on a classic southern sandwich. I didn't care for the tomato and lettuce so I at it as an open face sandwich.   Parking tip...park across the street in the movie theatre parking lot if you're \"parallel parking challenged\" like I am."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered the shrimp and chicken kabobs. Chicken was dry and the shrimp and zucchini were so burnt that they were inedible (see picture). I was shocked that they would even serve this dish prepared this way. \"Greek\" salad came with no dressing and vegetables were bland and undercooked. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The lamb sandwich was good, the slaw wasn't. My friend never got his food. I finished and we waited whilst games were played behind the counter. Eventually he got a refund but it was handled awfully."}
{"text":"Zoe's Kitchen has an excellent business philosophy with very average food, and this location messes up my girlfriends order very often. She has gotten food from this location over 20 times, and I would say they have messed up her order over half of those times. I've been blown away by how they could mess up a simple request like \"no veggies\" multiple times. I get a mistake here and there, but I haven't seen one location forgot simple instructions this many times. Nonetheless, my gf will still keep coming here, and I will still keep paying for this nonsense."}
{"text":"Excellent quick mediterranean cuisine. Tossed greek salad.  Recommend Kebobs...steak or salmon.  Nice staff"}
{"text":"Gotta love Zoe's orzo salad! And depending on how you feel their lime juice is always a great option if you don't want the boringness of water or the unhealthiness of soda.  When I first tried Zoe's it was at location down in Charlotte proper and that was back when I was more into the greasy mess type sandwiches loaded with beef, sauteed onions, cheese and the like. But I've recently become acquainted with their healthy green selections. Also, they introduced me to orzo which is a confusing little pasta with striking similarities to rice and just as versatile yet arguably far more palatable. Top that filling, hefty portion of orzo salad with a few chicken or shrimp skewers to add your daily protein to this scrumptious meal.  Aside from the obviously good sandwiches, Zoe's has your basic but great soups, some giant cookies and sweets on the counter to entice you while you order and an extensive menu of healthier options."}
{"text":"Excellent food with sizable portions. Extremely clean and bright, will definitely be coming back. I have had several things at Zoe's including the chicken roll ups and protein plate - everything has been outstanding."}
{"text":"Love Zoes! It's healthy and convenient and there's something for everyone. The food is good but the front staff is not very knowledgeable on ingredients in their dishes and one didn't know what vegan meant. Really? You work in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really great food. They have an app that is hit or miss. Mostly miss. I order here frequently and the app often fails. The error I get says to call the restaurant to place the order. Zoe's please fix the app."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite lunch place. The food is so fresh and healthy. Their seasonings and flavors are so great together. I always know coming here i will get a solid, healthy meal. I recommend this place to anyone that wants quality food."}
{"text":"Ordered at 12:47 on 12/10/17 it's now 1:33pm, STILL no food, we are leaving! Never returning. BEWARE."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak kebob entree. It was burnt to a crisp, beyond charred. Instead of the taste of delicious steak I got the taste of discussing burntness. When I brought this up to the manager he looked at me blankly. The cashier was behind him and began to grab, what I assume was a gift card for a free meal for next time, but then he said something to her about a \"paper trail\" and placed it back up behind the counter. The manager did not acknowledge me again, so I stood there waiting for something to happen. After a  minute or so the manager looked at me with a sour expression, as if he didn't want to be there, and stocked to the back. At this point I walked out. Take the mangers sentiment, you don't want to be there either.  At least not at this location."}
{"text":"Their menu is innovative, healthy, and interesting so I was excited to try my cauliflower rice bowl with salmon.  The restaurant in general was a little bit cluttered and messy which made me wonder if the food prep areas were clean and safe...  The food came out quickly.  The Israeli skhrug was delicious - my first time trying that and I was impressed.  The salmon was pretty nasty - as someone else commented here \" as old and dry as the Arizona summer\".  Indeed.  It was so old-fish tasting that I couldn't even comment on the preparation (the harissa sauce).  The tzatziki sauce was *ok* and the large portion of straight feta was a bit too much of the same.  The menu sounded great and the food looked amazing but in the end it was mostly pretty disappointing.    My recommendations: 1.  Watch the Clutter it reflects poorly on the cleanliness 2.  Take a good look at where your salmon is coming from - you may need to find a different supplier who can ensure greater freshness.  And definitely don't overcook it.  For the moderate+ pricing I'm expecting a nicely prepared salmon"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today awesome service! The guy who took my order great customer service! Great attitude! Loved his service & choice of steak kabobs! He served with a smile .. awesome! Place was neat, quiet & food was delicious! Suggest to anyone!! Stop by & enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off AMAZING chocolate cake!! Most of the good is awesome !! But sometimes service is a little slow :-/"}
{"text":"I was very pleased that our neighborhood got a Zoes Kitchen. It is a great place for vegetarian and vegan fare. My favorite is the vegetable kabob with a salad and beans. I've been to two other locations and they can be really busy during lunch hour. I still don't think too many people know about this place but I have started to see business picking up. I will just enjoy the shorter lunch lines while I can but it is always worth the wait anyway."}
{"text":"First off, the decor is beautiful and slightly more upgraded than their other two Phoenix locations. Real plates & silverware is a nice change instead of their usual metal trays. Upholstered booth seating and a nice large corner booth add great charm.   Of course I had to start with the chocolate cake, which was on point. Almost wish I had a tall glass of cold milk to go with it LoL. Perfect combination of moist cake,  gooey decadent frosting with a slight crunchy coating on top. Yummmmmm.  Had the Greek chicken pita and a side of the pasta salad which has always been a favorite of mine at the other two Phoenix locations.   Greek chicken pita and pasta salad were a slight disappointment which made me sad. I've always been used to their great quality food, so the fact that the grilled chicken,  pita and pasta (the main components! ) were all dry made me so sad! Flavors were there, the grilled onions being my favorite. I had to add their signature greek dressing in order to add moisture. :(  Nice they had an app available for download to which if you take a pic of your receipt you get free goodies on your next visit. That's when I noticed I never got my receipt.  LoL"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Very laid back place. Nice spot for a casual lunch or dinner and healthy as well."}
{"text":"Yet again, the food here was great.  I was pretty full after eating snacks, but still ate the steak kabobs. This is the signature dish that I get every time I come here.  The hummus with pita bread is good too, but make sure to ask for extra pots bread.  Delicious food!  Great service!  I love it here."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, healthy food. I always order the same thing, chicken kabobs. I recommend coming for lunch as the food seems to be fresher. I also purchase the bottled dressing and recreate my own Greek salad at home. Was excited when they opened this location close to my house. I used to drive to Phoenix to eat at Zoe's."}
{"text":"Have been big fan since the opening and eat here 2x per week  But, if you are going to serve salads one way in the store and another when placing to go orders the customer should be told  Flat grilled chicken is different than a chicken Breast   Tossed if different than not tossed  Large pieces of vegetables are different than cut up small (Aja chopped salad)  Just saying it should be consistent"}
{"text":"Yelp should host an event at this new gem.  I love the concept they have going.  It's in a great location and you can't miss it if you're driving north on Scottsdale Rd before reaching Kierland.  Order the steak kabobs and you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.  They like to tease you with a basket of 4 inch chocolate chunk cookies at the register.  Yup, I couldn't resist.  I will keep coming back here to try more of the menu items."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had!  The kitchen and wait staff were literally arguing and losing tickets such that every customer had to keep coming up to the counter after 20 minutes or more looking for their food.  Several people had food made incorrectly.  After 25 minutes, they came up to me asking for my name because they had no more tickets left.  They couldn't find it or what I ordered so I asked for my money back and left.  No apology or anything!  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh yummy food ! I always end up getting something evolving chicken . Last night was the chicken roll up with feta and a side of fruit . The fruit was SO good . Very fresh and juicy pineapple . I'm craving more right now . My only complaint is I once ordered a side of pita and hummus . They gave me a huge thing of hummus but only 4 tiny triangles of pita bread ... For the price they should spared a little more pita bread . Overall highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Coming to Zoes off Camelback has always been an OK experience. However, this time my co-worker and I went on our lunch break. The place is pretty dead as we beat the rush. 20 minutes pass and she still didn't have her food. She goes up to the register & shows the young lady her receipt and both my co-worker and the young lady see the order is ticketed & still waiting to be prepared at the window. The young lady shouts at the cooks \"you forgot to prepare order #9\" in front of all the customers that were there. My co-worker asked that the manager make it right. About 1 minute goes by and my co-worker gets her food. Simply delivered at the table with a \"sorry about that\" from the girl at the register. The manager never came over to address the situation and our lunch break was over by the time her food arrive. Horrible experience & lack of care for their customers."}
{"text":"Ordered a salmon kabob entree with the Greek salad to go...received mostly lettuce and three sad little pieces of salmon and no dressing- the hummus sample was also missing.  I really love Zoes food but there seems to be something wrong with my order almost every time I go here lately and if this were only the first instance I wouldn't be writing this review."}
{"text":"I want to keep loving Zoes but it is just not the same. The new menu brings sucks and every single time I go in I have a problem with something. How hard is it to leave the pasta or potatoes out of the tossed salad? The old menu was fabulous. The hummus is still amazing but it's never good with cold hard pita bread or their nasty pita chips. The last 2times I came I was eating dirt with my salad. And don't dare even attempt to ask for the manager... her attitude is definitely not manager material. She can't even apologize to the continued mess ups. I hate to say it but I'm gonna have to find another Greek restuarant."}
{"text":"I had the rolled spinach wraps. They were really, really delicious! There were two downsides. The first being they were extremely high in sodium, as I looked up the nutritional information. The second being the portion size was small, the side of veggies were bigger than the whole wrap itself. I would recommend going here if you're trying to eat a little better, but keep in mind the sodium was a little ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We pulled over to grab lunch here this weekend based solely on the appearance... It looked like it would be great! Their menu didn't seem that unique, but the girl who took our order was extremely friendly and offered some advice on her favorites, which included a pita and for both of us to get sides of the pasta salad. For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful. When our food was brought to us, my pita already was torn all the way down, so there was no way I was going to be able to manuever eating it with my hands. I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife.  Flavors were good, nothing special. Chicken was dry, and the pasta salad was nothing I would write home about.  We left full, somewhat pleased, but could have had the same experience for half the price."}
{"text":"My brother has been RAVING about Zoe's Kitchen for months. Specifically this new cauliflower rice bowl with salmon. So today I thought I'd try something new.. I ordered just that, with extra salmon & Tzatziki sauce on the side.   Cauliflower Rice Bowl - Harissa Salmon $12.59 Tzatziki Sauce $0.29 Add Harissa Salmon $4.49 with tax came out to $18.78 (Pricey.. but this was my first meal -possibly why I was so irritated during this experience.. & my brother insisted they were so good!)  My food was cold & my salmon was dry.. (cold & dry salmon isn't pleasant.. even with the .29¢ tzatziki sauce. I only got 4 pieces of salmon.. which I found out is the normal amount.. so I should have received 8 pieces? I've never had it before.. so maybe it's supposed to be cold. The employees weren't approachable enough for me to want to return and ask.. But even the salmon?.. that's suspect to me.   It's not even the cold food or that they forgot my EXTRA salmon that I PAID for. It's the terrible service I received.   I ordered online to make the most of my lunch break. My email said it's be ready at 6:50PM & I arrived at 6:52PM.   When I pulled up to the establishment I was intrigued by  the seemingly convenient drive-through window for call ahead orders.. It clearly states it's for call ahead or online orders. There's no indication of hours or that it was shut down.. I hesitated but then, I was excited and thought I'd be on my way quickly.  I waited a total of five minutes while the two employees at the register inside, kept glancing at me and helping people at the registers.. At first they were with customers. But then they both were just leaning against the back counter tops.. & STILL casually glancing in my direction & quickly looking away. I decided to park & walk inside since my food had already been paid for online.    The young lady at the register just stared at me for a while..saying nothing.. no \"hellos\" \"welcome in!\" Or \"how can I help you?\".. When I approached the register she told me she was waiting for someone and showed me the patrons credit card. OK, that's perfectly fine.. I'll wait my turn. The young man at the other register was talking to another patron. So again, I patiently waited. Then two ladies walked in front of me and waited behind the patron talking with the young man. The young man abruptly excused himself from the conversation and took the order of the two ladies that got there after me.   At this point I waited an extra 10 minutes when my food should have been ready and handed to me at the drive-through window! It seriously takes less than a minute to greet me at a window and hand me my order.   I'm very disappointed in the lack of service I received &  kind of hurt at the lack of customer service I was given.... No time was taken to connect with me when I came inside let alone at the drive through window. For the price I paid for a cauliflower rice bowl with extra salmon, I'd appreciate friendly and quicker service.. not expect, but appreciate."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Mediterranean food in town. However, perfect for a quick stop or a place to sit and work. I had a short gap in between clients at work and was happy to find Zoe's nearby. Free wifi, and reasonably sized portions. Again, the food isn't anything great, but they have some good things to snack on. My food came out so fast! Though I noticed others around me were waiting for a bit. To me, the service was great and I noticed that employees were genuine and sincerely sorry to other customers around me for mistakes or long waits for food. Not a bad option for a quick bite or to sit for a bit and get some work done."}
{"text":"The food \"sounds\" delicious. However, I called three times during regular business hours to place a order for delivery and didn't get a answer. I guess Chinese it is...."}
{"text":"Like this place for a quick healthy lunch. Been there with my daughter: I had baked feta, it was good but from descriptions I had other expectations. My daughter had chicken kaboobs with rice and salad and it looks and taste really good."}
{"text":"Just paid $10 for a sloppy paper plate of flavorless slaw and cold chicken. You can literally find better ready made food at your local grocery store. With that said the place is clean and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Gave me WRONG  order at Drive Thru. Long wait. Multiple parties milling around at the To Go desk inside when I returned food and no attempt to make good on their error. \"I don't know what happened \" according to the manager. Obvious what happened. A weak \"I'm sorry\". Other patrons complaining loudly also."}
{"text":"Zoe's is fine, clean and simple with just enough trendiness to make you feel better about yourself for coming here than a fast food restaurant.   Our food was plain and simple, chicken kabobs and a quesadilla.   I guess we should have tried the lime ade and the cake, maybe next time, and then I'll give then another star."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Might be back because I saw a few more vegan options on the menu. The staff is horrible. Terrible customer service. My food was ready but the front girls didn't notice because they were too busy eating cake and gossiping. Had to wait an extra 5-10 minutes because of them and all I ordered was hummus and pita."}
{"text":"Not worth it in my opinion. Had the tossed Greek salad with roasted veges which were a joke. Veges weren't done at all and the onions tasted sour. Also big chunks of the outer peel. The salad was big and the chicken was fresh but there was WAYYY too much diced raw red onion. Like so much I stopped eating the salad. Would have given this place 1 star except for the portion size was good. Now after reading other reviews I just hope I don't get sick. Won't be back. There are so many better Mediterranean places. Should have gone with my gut."}
{"text":"Decent Lunch spot. The food is consistent as well as the service. I like that they have 3 ice teas to choose from: Regular, Sweet, and Green. I can't say that I crave the place, but it is a nice place to go if you don't want fried food or smell of Subway. My favorite is the pimento cheese sandwich with turkey added to it. It might be a bit weird for most but when I am \"hankering for hunker'n\", it hits the cheese spot."}
{"text":"Steak kababs burnt and come with sauce which tastes like soy sauce and leaves a bad after taste. Veggies burnt like paper. Grilled potatoes taste like cooking oil. Not worth."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot! Very fresh foods, you can tell exactly what you're eating.  Even the fruit salad looks made fresh daily (and its not your usual melon and cantaloupe mix).  Their menu is healthy to begin with, but you can also ask for their Simply 500 menu and see all their options with 500 or fewer calories. The Greek chicken pita is huge and only 460 calories...delicious!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food options at Zoe's but I am continuously disappointed in the service. More often than not I am not given what I order, which is especially frustrating when I am ordering take out or catering. Definitely double check everything is correct with your order before leaving because currently I am eating a salad that came with zero salad dressing and no chicken like I asked for. So unless you like $10 lettuce plain, double check."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here a couple of times a month for lunch during the work day, and everyone here is always quick and very accommodating. The menu is quite large and has a nice range of items to choose from. My favorite items are probably the chicken salad sandwich, the spinach roll ups with chicken, and the chicken marsala."}
{"text":"Zoe's has recently become our go-to place for healthier eating.  We love their hummus trio for a starter, and their kabobs for dinner (shrimp and salmon) are divine!  It's funny, but on one takeout, they mistakenly gave us salmon, instead of chicken, kabobs.  The salmon kabobs were so fabulous that we get them regularly now!    While their rice is very good, it's usually a tad salty.  What's great is that you can easily substitute any other side.  Their Greek salad is great (standard with the kabobs), as are their grilled veggies and more hummus (we can't get enough of Zoe's!).    I like that I can order online, and take my time placing the order.  Lots of variations are available, which aren't as readily apparent when ordering in the store.  I've come to terms with their prices, and think their food is fairly priced for the quality."}
{"text":"This was my first time here but my wife and daughter are frequent fliers.  I had the steak kabobs and they were oh-so-deilicious along with the Trio of hummus dip and chips..love it and yes I will be a frequent flier soon as well"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, I have been eating Zoe's since it originally opened in Birmingham AL. The food is always good and most importantly consistent. I get the spinach roll ups and pasta salad usually but everything I've ever tried is amazing."}
{"text":"I think it's dangerous that I discovered this place while passing by...ordered the Mediterranean chicken entree with a side of basil pesto hummus. The hummus was the perfect consistency and not oily or runny/bland. The chicken was moist and soft with the onions perfectly caramelized. Even the Greek salad it came with was delicious with the perfect ratio of things together and the onions and feta not too strong or overbearing. Told my coworkers about you guys so hopefully they find you too!!"}
{"text":"First time diner at Zoe's, and I will definitely be back!  My mom and I shared the hummus trio appetizer, the orzo tabbouleh salad with shrimp, and the Greek chicken pita with a side of roasted vegetables.  We had to start out sharing the large round table with another couple because there were no other inside tables to be had, and it was too cold out (in Scottsdale... what??) to eat on the patio, which had ample seating.  First came the hummus trio, which was accompanied by soft and crispy pita wedges, fresh cucumbers, grape tomatoes, and green pepper rings.  All three hummus selections were delicious, and very fresh tasting.  Then came our entrees.  We didn't even get to the chicken pita sandwich because the hummus and salad filled us both up!  The orzo tabbouleh salad was fantastic!  Very fresh and vibrant flavors.  The shrimp and zucchini kabobs (2) were cooked perfectly.  The food arrived quickly and the service is very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend Zoe's kitchen for a fast, healthy and delicious lunch in the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I always order the Mediterranean Tuna here. It's good, but nothing else on the menu appeals to me. I go back for a really, really, quick before theater dinner.  I agree with the other reviewers' description of the place.  No one has mentioned the iced tea - I really do like the fresh iced teas."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Rd Zoes is not as good as Camelback Zoes. First time they forgot our salads for our on line order and the shrimp kabobs were rubbery.  2nd time chicken kabobs had no seasoning and were dry. The chocolate cake first time was fantastic and second time was dry."}
{"text":"Updated:  After I was reached out to, I gave the place other shot and the second time around was much better.  Maybe it was just an off day.   Thank you for your wonder customer consideration."}
{"text":"I'm pretty generous with stars. I want to give this place 4 stars, but for me it's merely solid GOOD not great. I'm solid neutral, no major complaints nor wows. I'd give 3.5 if I could, but I can't go 4 - it would be unfair to other places I've given 4s and liked!  Beautiful location as others describe. Been here twice mid-week for lunch with a friend.  I avoid potatoes & grains, so the 2 times I have been here I had #1. a big Greek salad #2. Chicken Kabobs sub slaw instead of rice.  I am sad to say the chicken kabob today was DRY. It's the featured item on the skewer, I was really hoping they would be moist, flavorful chunks. I doused it in the Greek dressing on the table, which helped. I expected the kabobs to have more flavor/Greek or Mediterranean seasoning, was a little boring tasting for me. My experience of chicken at the other location made me expect more flavor. Perhaps I am ordering the wrong style of Chx for me, will have to ask next time. Portion-wise, it's slightly smaller than I would expect for over $10... I was actually hungry 2 hours later. But again, I subbed veggies for the rice.  Greek salad tastes good, fresh, nice little pitted kalamata olives on it.   I don't like traditional slaw at all so Zoe's tastes good to me because it is neither creamy nor sweet. Love the feta in it, & the flavor is tangy but not puckery.   My friend had spinach wraps. They were smaller than I am used to seeing as a wrap, less than 2\" circumference. Reminded me of the size of a hefty egg roll. But they looked good. She's also a light eater; not sure a hungry guy would be satisfied...  I walk right past the cookies here, but last year tried one from the Scottsdale location & they were crazy-good, like \"Uh oh, I'm gonna eat this whole damn thing\" good.  I'm giving 3 because nothing wows me about the place (other than it's lovely location in that beautiful shopping center) . Maybe other dishes really rock."}
{"text":"This is my go to place with my coworkers when I'm looking for something fresh and not too expensive!!   I'm a creature of habit and the one item I enjoy is the Turkey Sandwich which is lightly toasted and has this feta spread on it that takes the sandwich over the top. I've previously had the Greek Chicken Pita & Kabobs. They have a lot of non-meat items which helps with those in your group. Th e side choices are good to compliment the meal. I usually go for the mixed fruit of s bag of chips.   They have soft drinks, teas, and lemonade and today they had 'limeade' which appeared freshly made. It's a Greek style chain that I keep in mind for lunch with coworkers and I leave satisfied! Not fat and full... I feel like I made a good lunch choice!   The location is nice and convent and plenty of parking. Ideal location for lunch"}
{"text":"The employees were very nice and personable. They made a mistake in my order, but they quickly rectified the situation and got me what I ordered. It's an excellent establishment."}
{"text":"I love love Zoe's, I've been to many different locations but the Scottsdale/ Greenway is the closest location to me, however this place has a serious lack of good management. I've given it many opportunities in hopes my bad experience was a bad day, but unfortunately every time I come it's something or another!!!  They always get my order wrong, they struggle refilling utensils, the wait is crazy long for a \"fast food\" place, it's so sad that such an amazing food concept can't figure  out the little details.  Although not a huge deal but definitely a turn off!    I had 30mins today to get lunch, after waiting 10mins in line (there were only 3 people in front of me) they announced it would be at least 15-20 moms wait on the food and given my experience I thought and that's if they get it right! So I walked out went across the street grabbed a salad was in and out in 5mins! So the little details do make a huge difference!   I hope for us all they get it together so we can continue to enjoy your delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place located in Arizona !! If you can't get to Petra Or Luna Grill which are the best for Greek food located in California then eat at Zoe's kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Halfway through meal. Greeted upon entry. Excellent service. Second time but at a different location. Same result. Good!"}
{"text":"My first time in here. Lots of non meat dishes. I ordered braised beans and grilled veggies and ended up ordering Spanish rolls and Cole slaw to go. All the meals look as good as the ads. When in the area stop in for some good eats. I'll be back."}
{"text":"From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross.   We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option.   Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara.   We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!  It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members.   As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return.   My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!  I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but."}
{"text":"If you ask me, I liked it! I like the decor and feel of the place and what I had for lunch was great! (Chicken Roll Ups) The water tasted funny, though.  If you ask my coworkers (there were 8 of us), more than half said they won't be back. They said they were unimpressed with the food and confused by the service.  I'll admit, one person never received her food. She told someone and they still didn't bring it. I think we told someone else also. Eventually, she got up and I believe talked to the manager. They gave it to her finally and the order was still wrong. She did get her money back and he apologized and said that they will do better.  They have been open for, what? two weeks? Since I have only been once I will give them the benefit of the doubt and return. I can't say the same for everyone else.  If you go for lunch I recommend getting there at 11:15/11:30... Shortly after 11:30 it was packed!!"}
{"text":"I recently had Zoe's cater a bridal luncheon I was hosting. They were extremely kind and helpful while I was placing my order via phone, and helped to ensure that I ordered the right amount of food for the 30 people I was hosting. They had the food ready at 10am on a Sunday, an hour before they opened. I appreciated that they accommodated the order pick up time even though it was before they were officially open. The food was fantastic. We had the kabobs, with rice pilaf and pasta salad. Everything was absolutely delicious and all of my guests loved it. I would highly recommend Zoe's for eat-in, take-out and especially if you need a great catered lunch or dinner for a large group!"}
{"text":"Parking can be tricky here as the lot is very small and McDowell can be pretty busy. Haven't tried anything but the chicken and shrimp kabobs and I order that every time I'm there. The lemon and chocolate chip cookies are seriously amazing tho! Only complaint is that they seem to run out of veggies often (which is a side on the menu) and last time I was there it was probably about 7p and the girl didn't want to remake the tea because they closed soon and didn't want to waste it. While that was considerate for her work, it would've been nice to know before buying a drink. Also, her attitude could've been nicer as she literally was like \"yeah I'm not remaking anymore, it'll just get thrown away.\" They also had like two hours left of business and the restaurant was busy."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and hot. Plenty of delicious vegan and gluten free options. I had the salmon and cauliflower rice, also the trio salad. They were both delicious. I plan on frequenting this place more often. Their house made Lemonade is to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of Zoes and am thrilled to have one close. They've had a little growing pains but I've been here several times and the food and service are excellent. We will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"First time getting lunch from this Zoe's location. I'm so glad I decided to order lunch from there today! My food was delicious and order completely correct. Since I ordered ahead I also didn't have to wait, which was great since I went during busy lunchtime. Great place in Birkdale to get a yummy, healthier bite to eat!"}
{"text":"When traveling up to chandler for a doctors visit from Tucson we stumbled up Zoe's kitchen. Honestly I was a little skeptical since it looked similar to a fast food joint from the outside. Being a celiacs sufferer and dairy free lifestyle. I was drawn to Fresh made to order food. They certainly had FRESH food. First you order much like how chipotle is set up. They modified my bowl to have no taziki sauce or feta. Then we had cauliflower rice as the base. They serve or cold but warmed it for me on the flat top. The DO NOT have microwaves as it should be! I got a Side of basil hummus which was probably one of the BEST hummus dishes I had, served with a side of cucumber. -simply Devine. While I like the concept of an ordinary restaurant with extraordinary food. I can't help to think how it's possibly to look less chain like to 1st timers on the outside?  but alas, that is chandler for you. Everything is TAN. Happy I moved back to Tucson, but I do enjoy an occasional trip."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to come here to celebrate my last day as Liaison on August 30, 2017 @ 11:52am.    It was super clean, the atmosphere was perfect for the occasion, the staffs were super helpful since this was the first time I been here and first time eating this type of food.  I didn't know much about the foods here so I kept it safe and ordered some kind of grilled chicken pita. It was good.  Overall I had a pleasant experience....service was excellent and fast, it's a fun and clean place, excellent lighting, however the price is kind of high.  I would definitely come back some day, on a payday, on a month with three paydays."}
{"text":"I'm glad I've discovered another salad place close to work! Apparently a few times Zoe's has catered lunches for our sales staff - always wondered who it was that made the tasty kebobs and salad! #themoreyouknow  I felt lucky there was no line when I went to the actual location recently, so I could figure out what I wanted. The menu is fairly simple & straighforward - salads, sides, sandwiches, appetizer things... basically a Mediterranean Panera. The cashier was super helpful as I'm trying to eat low-carb and didn't want a salad with potatoes or pasta - Zoe's is really helpful about modifying their menu [her words]. So I went with the very popular Tossed Greek Salad sans pasta + tomatoes. She gave me a cup [normally an added charge] to grab a drink so I tried their hibiscus unsweet tea, which wasn't bad.   I didn't have to wait long for my salad to be ready, maybe just 5 min total, before I was out the door with my big ol' salad in hand. Got back to the office and inhaled it - really tasty and plentiful for the $9 I paid. Probably could have split it in half but I was hungry. Really liked the cooked onions with chicken - I think they should cook them in that simple Zoe's dressing moving forward!"}
{"text":"I was so excited with their new menu but sadly they are truly a ripoff with the portions and don't seem to care. Also service is extremely slow."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY- I feel bad about saying it but this place is awful. They are understaffed and over run. We went there on a Friday night and they got 10% of our order right. I ordered steak kabobs which came out ice cold. I sent them back and 15 minutes later they came out nice and hot. Unfortunately, I could barely chew the pieces of steak on my plate. I made sure to have a few people in our party try it to ensure I wasn't just being critical. All three people who tried the meat agreed with me.   I had high hopes walking in but that's not enough. Maybe they can get adequately staffed and hire a chef. If not this place will be here for about 90 days.   Sorry"}
{"text":"This WAS my go to spot for healthy food on the go. But not anymore. I have been craving this since I got back into the country. I went on a whim for lunch with my daughter to satisfy my craving.  I normally get the Veggie kabob with a side of rice and beans. My daughter gets the Chicken Kabob. So we kept with the routine, and ordered the same. The young lady who answered the call explained to me that the menu changed, and now you get to chose your sides. I asked for my usual sides.  The bill came to $19.65, no problem. This is usually what it costs, and since I love it so much, cost is never an issue. I usually dont check my bags because I am used to excellence service from Zoës. (My biggest mistake of the day!) So when I arrived home to find this sub-par food(BLAND and thrown together..no dressing...cold kabobs)  stingy portions, and missing sides, condiments, and cutlery...I was livid! I called back and spoke to Anita and she assured me a manager would call me back(this never occured). I called back and spoke to a young man who was very polite and assured me that for my troubles, I would be refunded half and I could come back and they will give me a free meal. I have yet to receive the $10.00 back....oh well....but best believe ya girl is going back tonight so Zoe can redeem herself..if not......as my girl Lauryn Hill sang \"You just lost one\""}
{"text":"I had a sore throat today and wanted a hot soup that was healthy. I've heard so much about Zoey's and wanted to try it out.  Now, I only ordered the Mediterranean lentil soup, but after looking at the menu and the variety, I will definitely be back.  They have soups, salads, sandwiches, bowls, roll ups, kabobs, small family meals, large family meals, snacks boxes if you're in the run....all with healthy and fresh ingredients.  It's a win win when you can find a place that makes better choices of food when you're in a hurry.  Prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable!  I'll be back next week to try the power grain bowl! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Lots of really great choices on the menu.  If I had to design the perfect menu, it'd be pretty close to this.  When I get back to serious weight loss, I'll be coming in here a lot.  Lots of salads and meals that are low on carbs and heavy on veggies and meat.  The beef they use is not good though.  The beef kabobs are really, really chewy.  I grew up with cheap beef and it is my style, but I know a lot of people would be very disappointed.  Learn how to do beef better.  I'm sure you've already lost customers with that stuff.  I'll get the chicken next time."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for sometime so I went during lunch from work. I was very disappointed as I waited for over 30 minutes for my order which I never received. I had to ask for a refund since I had to go back to work. I walked out without tasting anything. As I sat and watched everyone was very disorganized and blaming other employees for errors on orders. I have heard the food was good but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I will come back to and if it continues to have the good quality food I imagine I will up it to 4 stars.   I appreciate greatly that they have gluten free options.  On our first visit though the salmons and chicken were both extremely over cooked. On our 2nd visit, we both got shrimp and while it was overcooked as well it was mostly edible.  The salad was good and I am in love with the feta they put on it. The feta is so good it made me eat the \"field\" greens which I normally don't love. I also really like the coleslaw. The potato salad is pretty good but a bit too sour for me. I also could love the beans except for the overpowering rosemary flavor."}
{"text":"Not really 4 stars. But...not really 3 stars. Walk In. Order. Get your number. Sit and wait for food. Eat. Yup.  Clean. Nothing fancy. It is the all familiar format. Moves quick. Order the Greek chicken pita featuring...yes chicken!  Very dry chicken. Lettuce, tomatoes, feta, cooked sweet onions. Ok. The best part of the meal...white beans. Beans with oregano. Really enjoyed that. Real dishes. Real cutlery. I like that.  Wish we did not have paper cups for our drinks."}
{"text":"My favorite Zoe's location!  Always consistent with their food and great customer service.  love their white beans mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for places where I can get a healthier meal when we eat out and my boyfriend will be willing to eat there with me and be able to order something he enjoys as well. We just ordered the steak stack, and chicken salad sandwich for him which he loved! I ordered the shrimp kebab with grilled veggies and rice. It was all really good. We also shared the chocolate cake which we both enjoyed. The only thing we didn't like was the braised white beans-they tasted like Bay leaves or one of those dried spices you don't want to eat too much of. Otherwise, loved the entire experience. We ordered to go and ate at home. I didn't get the idea to take a pic and write a review until after we'd already pretty much finished our meal, so the picture I posted isn't doing the food justice."}
{"text":"My family and I love, love. LOVE Zoes Kitchen.  Their food is remarkably fresh, healthy, and incredibly good. Even my 9 year old loves it, and she is one of the pickiest eaters you could ever know.  Their Mediterranean chicken is sautéed with grilled onions and let me tell you it is TO DIE FOR!!!! They also have friendly service and a well cleaned dining area if you're dining in the restaurant. Wish I could give them more than five stars!!"}
{"text":"The steak kabob and veggies were way too salty. I ate my food only because I'd rather not waste it. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The portions are incredibly small. We spent a lot more than we anticipated with two kids and four adults. There was no pita on the menu, we asked for extra and were given three tiny wedges. The protein bowls were not much protein at all.   One star for pleasant staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of our favorites for lunch and an early dinner! My husband loves the beef kabobs and I love the salmon kabobs. Food is always fresh and filling. We keep telling people about this place and everyone agrees once they go here!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's something different. I usually get the kabobs, fruit and the roasted potatoes. I can order ahead of time and pick it up. That's fantastic! Parking in Birkdale can be tricky, so I usually just park in the movie theater lot or enter the deck between TCBY and the fudge shop and then Zoes is on the far right. Really nice to mix it up from the constant burger, chicken, etc."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day and got a vegetarian item since I wasn't in the mood for meat that day. The veggie pita pizza did not disappoint. It was packed with flavor without being salty. I really really liked it. I would definitely order it again-also comes with a small Greek salad. My friend got the beef kabobs and it looked delicious. I will try those next time!"}
{"text":"There food is amazing, I live in San Tan Valley and crave Zoes, and sometimes will make that drive, just to get the steak kabobs, the meat melts in your mouth amazing steak, and greek salad. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.  Zoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.  The food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.  There's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again."}
{"text":"I ordered the quinoa salad and it's delicious!!  All of the ingredients are fresh and crisp. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is amazing. It comes with dressing but it's hard to detect, so I ordered extra and it was perfect. The employees are friendly and smile often."}
{"text":"I SOOOO wanted to love this place as it is cute as a bug's ear. Not that I'm saying there's bug's here,  I just think it's a lovely, modern clean space, with lots of light. My friend was craving the Greek pita. \"OMG...it's soooo good, you have to go get us some.\" So, I get our to go pitas (chicken, lettuce, feta and tomato), certainly not inventive, yet it sounded like it would hit the spot. \"OMG....the side pasta is sooooo good, you have to get that.\" Fine. Two Greek pitas both with pasta sides to go. Oh, and the chocolate cake. He said to get the chocolate sheet cake. Well, let me just say kiddies, the pita was dry, dry, dry. Sauceless and dry. Did I say it was dry. Chicken was dry. Pita was dry. It totally fell apart. And then so did I. Dry. Dry I say. Pasta side was actually quite good, all 2 oz. of it. BUT THE CAKE...OH MARY....THE CAKE! Truly a slice of chocolate heaven. I will go back and try some other items. Staff was friendly. I liked the space. Cake was, cheap, like a penny or something."}
{"text":"My first time here. I ordered the GRuben sandwich which was recommended to me by the cashier. it was worth it! Next time I think I would try the kabobs tho. This location seem to have lots of seating. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Overall it seemed quite clean also. parking seemed to be a bit limited. I would definitely recommend this place and I plan to be back!"}
{"text":"My family moved down here years ago and for the first ten years I couldn't find one healthy place to eat while in NC! Zoe's is one of many newer places where you can honestly  get good healthy food quickly and at a decent price. Salmon kabob got me hook line and."}
{"text":"I love eating healthy without spending a lot of money. This restaurant has a nice selection of healthy Mediterranean food that I like. Some of my family members are vegetarian and Zoe's works for all of us."}
{"text":"We are now regulars at this Zoe's location, either to dine in or for take out for lunch or dinner... the beef kabobs are so tender and flavorful... and all sides are healthy and yummy... nice variety on the menu of fresh food... very clean, bright atmosphere... cheerful staff."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nice employees here. The steak sandwich was juicy and delicious. The hummus and salad plate was fine, wasn't a fan of the pita they use. Would definitely come back but only because I felt the need to eat healthier. Service was way too slow for such an empty place. Might have been slower bc of the tasty steak sandwich"}
{"text":"I love Zoe's Kitchen. I go here almost every week for lunch. I always get the Greek Salad with chicken. I especially love the potatoes in this salad. The portion is big and you definitely will feel full!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quazi-healthy, fast casual lunch spot, Zoes is your spot. It's easy and great for a work week lunch. It's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good (not great), it does the trick and won't break the bank.    I usually get the chicken salad sandwich which carmelized onions. My girlfriend always gets the protein plate which looks good too. Plus, every item comes with chips and a side of your choice (slaw, potato salad, pilaf, etc.)  My favorite part about Zoe's you ask? That Diet Dr. Pepper is part of the soda fountain selection. Divine."}
{"text":"Now i like Zoes. Great fresh healthy food. But the salmon is old and dry as the Arizona summers. I paid $15 for a bowl and of course salmon is the biggest up charge but they couldn't do it right. Ruined my whole meal then charged $0.29 for a side of tzaziki. Not Gord!"}
{"text":"Gave it another try. When I called the person that answered the phone did not understand that I didn't want grilled onion. Then instead of saying \"pick up in 15-20 minute\" or something to that effect he just hung up. I had to call back to confirm that we didn't get disconnect. Then when I got home there was no dressing with my salad.  Somebody, please put a new manager in place. The leadership there is terrible."}
{"text":"Good place for something quick and healthy.  I'm a fan of the pasta salad--it's light and tasty!  So glad i live near both locations in central phx--so can do when i feel the urge:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE that there are now Zoes locations close to my office AND my home.  Having Zoes nearby makes it really easy to eat healthy on the days I fail to pack a lunch or have no interest in cooking dinner.  On the other hand, Zoes always has those cookies and chocolate cake on display and that makes it really hard to ignore my sugar cravings.  Argh!  But that cake is SO GOOD!  Its ok to indulge once in a while ... right?  My favorite Zoes menu items are the greek chicken pita, gruben sandwich, and chicken kabobs.  The chicken orzo soup is great too.  I also enjoy the selections of iced tea they have available.  The line at this location can be long and sometimes it's hard to find a table after ordering.  Most of the time I use the online ordering option and take it to go."}
{"text":"the tossed greek salad is LEGENDARY. OMG and the pasta salad and the tea here. i am in love!"}
{"text":"Their roasted red bell pepper hummus is so good! Yum. Their staff could be friendlier.... whenever i drive through the pick up area- they appear fumbled and take a few minutes  to address me."}
{"text":"A couple people told me that I would not like this place, but I did!  I liked it a lot actually.  I was smitten by the decor- super modern and clean and done right.  You know when people make their spaces look so modern it ends up just looking cheap... this place is not it.  The front door was a bit scary, if you don't watch your kids or immature friend or family members closely, it is possible that they could sever their body in half vertically.  Anyhow, I had the chicken roll ups, they were good.  The food is like food you can fix at home if you put some effort in it ( this means more than using the microwave or picking up take out and putting it on a plate).  The pita chips were very tasty too.  We got some of those.  The salads look big and green and healthy- the way a salad should look.  I plan to go back and I plan to get something different to try.  Neat concept, this Zoes."}
{"text":"Salmon kabobs were delish. Came with salad and hummus, very fresh.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The BEST steak kabobs I've ever had!!! The service is fast and friendly. Great spot for tasty, healthy eats."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to go but it has gone downhill. Last time I went there was no silverware, ice, or napkins, and one of the grills was broken. My mom and I got our salads relatively quickly, though we had to ask for plastic silverware meant for to-go orders to eat it, but my sister, her husband, and my 3 year old niece had to wait until we were done before their meat dishes arrived due to the grill crisis. I hope they get it turned around, it was one of my favorite places to go for quick but tasty food when I visited before now. The staff appears to be friendly and to care and they were definitely keeping moving, so it appears to be a mainly managerial issue."}
{"text":"To go Steak Stack was delicious. Should have posted review 12 days ago but forgot to post.  Anyway, i didnt forget about the chopped portobello that were embedded in the melty mozzarella, and the grilled onions, feta spread, tomato and rosemary oil on grilled sourdough. It was just a wonderful, tasty and a well put together sandwich."}
{"text":"Stop in today and got 2 Pita sandwiches- grilled chicken & lamb.  They were fantastic!! The grilled onions took these sandwiches to another level!!  We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but nothing incredible. I went here for lunch today and it was busy! It was difficult to find parking, but I managed to snag a space (in the lot next door...shhhh don't tell!). Anyway, it was easy enough to order, although none of their dishes really screamed at me (most of them sounded ok, but not great). At someone's suggestion, I ordered the chicken roll ups and they were alright. The chicken and the onions were good, but I think maybe the cheese or something in there made them taste just slightly off. Anyway, it was good, but I wouldn't run over there to get it. This place does get points for being fairly inexpensive and quick."}
{"text":"I had the worst customer service today. Took them about 25 minutes to make my to go order and on top of that showed me attitude. And the cherry on top was that they didn't complete my order and I saw that when I got home. Zoes kitchen hire better people at this location please."}
{"text":"Another chipotle model but with mediterranean food. They just recently opened - the food was fresh and tasty but I wasn't too impressed with the prices. Honestly I felt like I was paying for the interior decoration and building."}
{"text":"Decided to give Zoes another chance because their food is really good. The service at this location is just terrible. I have had my spats with Zoes previously and let some steam out, but nothing has improved, its actually getting worse there. So going forward, I know they take forever to get the orders out because this place is an unorganized mess, I placed my order to be ready by the time we got there at 11:10. Still took about 15 minutes to get out 2 orders, of very uncomplicated food. So from order at 10:40, to getting my food at 11:25, there is just no excuse on why this place cannot get it's act together. This time is a huge factor because most people who are here at this time are on lunch and are limited.   Looks like there is some new faces in front, where 4 people are just standing around. The new cashier was bad-mouthing her co-worker to me and my friend. There needs to be some leadership and morale improvements upfront.   Sorry Zoes, but this is my last time. Fool me twice, shame on me."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat delicious food while eating on the healthier side. Very tasty"}
{"text":"Best Hummus and it is wonderful. I could eat there weekly. Love the menus and never disappointed."}
{"text":"They've added a few new items lately.  The roasted vegetables as a side are a new and welcome twist.  A bit spicy, but just right.  Still LOVE their slaw.  Super friendly group- efficient and seems cleaner than it used to be.  Great hummus and pita."}
{"text":"Great place for the family. The chicken protein plate is cooked perfectly and the onions were delicious. I've had the piadina and the kids like their quesas. Good food, good prices, clean and bright."}
{"text":"I ordered the protein bowl and asked for no coleslaw as I can't have mayo. I informed them I wanted just extra veggies and they said it was no problem. When it finally came out after about 15 mins it was on a bed of coleslaw. So I sent it back. It came out with coleslaw still stuck to the chicken on a bed of grilled veggies (some still frozen). My friend who was with our group of 6 didn't even get her meal after asking 3 different people for it. The manager finally brought it over and it was still wrong. They at least boxed it up and gave her a refund. Out of the 6 of us only 1 person liked their meal. I have to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the hummus trio and pita were pretty good but that was it. I knew when I walked in and the tables were dirty and the bathrooms being just straight filthy I should have gone someplace else but According to my girlfriend wingstop next door isn't healthy so we stayed. I got the lamb gyro which didn't have a great flavor and the portion of meat is three tiny meatballs of I can only assume is institutional grade lamb and beef. The oven cooked falafel is seriously some of the worst falafel I have ever eaten. The staff was friendly enough and that's what brought this review from one star to two."}
{"text":"Excellent turkey slaw pita and quinoa salad!  The slaw has feta cheese in it, a combo which makes it extra tasty.  When I order to go, my food is always ready to go.  Parking is convenient at this location.  It is located at a shopping center so there is a huge parking lot.  There is outdoor seating also.  Staff are always pleasant.  I go there several times per week and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!   My boyfriend and I eat here a lot! The staff is ultra friendly and helpful and will basically customize any item you want. They also have a mobile app you can download and when you take a picture of your receipt they give you what is called a \"goodie.\" So far I have gotten a free side, a cup of limeade, and 1/2 off a sandwich.  Some things to try: - Braised white beans - Potato salad (cold and grilled) - Greek salad - Hummus  I usually go for the gluten free hummus and salad plate, which comes with cucumber instead of pita.   For you meat eaters, they have protein bowls, kabobs, and I hear the turkey sandwich is really good."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Zoe's by now, you must! They take Mediterranean food to an entirely new level with awesome flavor combinations. Definitely try the Greek salad as it's served over their delicious potato salad. Also, get the braised white beans, you won't be disappointed!   I was so excited when this location opened up and I have been to it several times since. The restaurant is always clean, the drink station is stocked, and the employees are friendly and helpful.   They have something for everybody here: vegans, vegetarians, meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Zoe's for probably a year but I always love it when I come! As I typically do, I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions, and your choice of a side (I chose their rice-yummy) and their greek salad. The salad is always huge so I usually save it for its own meal later. Their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good. We also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good, itself, but I like to put the dressing on it, too. My husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome. My brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it, too. The food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy. The prices are average for most places, nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it. Oh yeah, their fountain lemonade was out when I went but my husband recommended I try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter. I am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious. Not too tart or too sweet, just perfect. Love, love, love Zoes."}
{"text":"It's one of the more affordable places to grab lunch in Birkdale, but it's still a tad pricey (like everything else there.) My wife and I grabbed lunch there yesterday for the first time. You walk up to the counter, place your order and then pick a seat, and the waitress brings over your food when it's ready. The service was pretty quick and the staff were friendly.  I had the grilled chicken w/ orzo entree. The chicken was ok, but it tasted and felt like that rubbery processed chicken some restaurants use. The marinara sauce is extremely sweet, which is a no-go for an Italian like me. The orzo was cooked well and tasted decent. It also came with a side Greek salad which included lettuce, a ton of onion, green pepper, tomato, olives and lots of feta cheese, as well as three small triangles of pita. My wife had the grilled chicken and slaw pita sandwich which was better than my meal. We shared a limeade which was very sweet.  In all, it was an ok place. I'm in no rush to go back, but I wouldn't be against it if someone else was with me and wanted to."}
{"text":"I was planning on meeting some friends here but they must have gone to the other location. I decided to give it a try anyway. A few gluten-free options. I got the greek salad with grilled chicken. It was delicious and decent portion size. It was easy to tell it was very fresh. No iceberg lettuce here!"}
{"text":"A great fast casual option for Mediterranean fair. I've had the chicken skewers more than once, and I really like the flavor. Note: you can order things a la carte. My current fave is just chicken and veggie skewers without any sides. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review very short and sweet because until yesterday, I never really felt compelled to yell from the rooftops about Zoe's meals. Especially for my fellow vegetarians.  But the tides have changed, my friends. Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.  Now for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options.   I had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch.   Soooooo tasty!  Now I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.  Two notable changes:  1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.  2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents. (cheaper than the vending machine at work still)  Either way, I'm compelled now to patronize this little spot more often. Next time I'm trying the new spinach wraps...mmmm"}
{"text":"Message was heard loud and clear...another top notch meal at Zoe's. After some great meals and some not so great meal, communication of concerns were clearly addressed and am pleased to see the Zoe's we originally enjoyed. Four of us enjoyed an early dinner. Some of us had old favorites and others continue to explore the menu. Thanks for listening and reinforcing all that we've come to enjoy"}
{"text":"When Zoe's kitchen was featured on Groupon, I decided to buy one and check the place out. I had the tuna sandwich (with red onions) and the potato salad. My boyfriend had the chicken marinara plate, but I can't remember the side that he had. The price was really good- $20 for two meals, and I really loved the \"at-home\" feel they create. The bread my sandwich was served on could have been the same that I have sitting in my pantry at home, and it looked like all of the ingredients were fresh from home. Fortunately for me, the food didn't taste as though I had prepared it - it was FAR better!! I'm excited to go back to Zoe's to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"Zoe's is the best!!! My favorite is The Tossed Greek Salad. The portions are large, the food is fresh, and the staff is always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is a chain restaurant, so it doesn't really need a review, but since I eat here probably once a week, I thought I'd give my take on it anyway!  I think their Greek salad is great.  It has veggies on it like cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper, and those pepperoncini peppers.  Their dressing is light and simple, which I love.  I can just order the side of Greek salad, which is like $2.80 and I feel pretty full after that.  But I usually also get a side pasta salad or side of hummus also.  The other stuff on the menu is not that great, nothing spectacular -- oh except for the chocolate cake!  I love that cake and the frosting they put on top which is thin and forms a slight crunchy crust on top.  My only complaint with the cake is that the slices are cut very inconsistently.  So sometimes I get small slices and sometimes I get huge slices."}
{"text":"I love me some zöes kitchen, the food is delicious. The employees are always in a good mood, very nice and patient. My favorite dish is spinach roll ups, can never go wrong with that. Will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"My friend said this was to \"fast food\" like for a date.  It's the first time I thought of it as fast food.  Yes, the food came fast, and you order at the counter, but I've just always thought of it as more \"healthy food fast\" but that's not quite a general category is it?  I love to grab Zoe's.  Coincidentally, I like Feta, because as Lali mentioned, you have to like Feta to like Zoe's.  By brother was initially hesitant, but found himself craving Zoe's, and Feta after our last visit so I say to give it a try and don't be afraid.  The menu is SO simple it can be a bit shocking.  Salad, pita, kabobs, grilled chicken plate.  Pretty much any combo of chicken w/ veggies - even in their soup.  I really appreciate that they have a kids menu that isn't filled with things like french fries and chicken fingers.  They may give in to PB&J, but the rest of it will be just as healthy as what the adults are eating.    Last but not least - I love the modern/simple decor.  The \"kids\" paintings scattered around the place are pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:38.  Order up at 7:10. Restaurant less than half full.  Chicken skewer...chicken is luke warm, rice not much above room temp.  Fruit cup was fresh.  First time here.  Won't be back real soon."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a quick and inexpensive lunch or dinner! Their menu is a little overwhelming because there are so many options. But so far everything I've tried has been delicious. I love that their potato salad is vinegar based instead of mayonnaise. The dipping sauces for the kabobs are great, but my favorite one is the Israeli skhug sauce."}
{"text":"Happy we ended up here. The food was great and service outstanding. I have Greek heritage and this food was authentic. At least what I had. The sampler bowl with lamb was very tasty and spiced right. We will be back"}
{"text":"The soup,salad and kabob were tasty. The restaurant was clean and the order taker was friendly. It's a little pricey considering the utensils were plastic and cups are disposable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during break and ordered the chicken kabob with tzazikki sauce or however you spell it! The food came out fast and everything was hot and fresh and the sauce really picked up the dish. It was healthy and filling and is definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh & VERY good. The kitchen help needs to speed it up but I know this location is pretty new. Fantastic manager who worked hard to keep it going. Without her they'd be in trouble ( no matter how good the food is) the staff is friendly & it was really busy for 1:45 in the afternoon. I'll be back ~ however in the future I'm not willing to wait as long as I did. The kitchen needs to get their rears in gear."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed Zoe's Kitchen both times I have visited. Quick service, and helpful counter employees. Their limeade is divine, and their sweets are pretty damn delicious too. Salads, hummus, wraps - all good. Coincidentally, I got the same thing both times - BUT, they didn't look the same at all. It's my fault and I take the blame for not returning my salad the second visit. But it was missing feta and olives - a big disappointment for me but I was partway through and they were super lunchtime busy. Again - my bad. I won't make that mistake again, and neither should you. Always speak up if there is a problem so they can make it work for you."}
{"text":"I love Zoe's but this one specifically was a bust. Floor was a mess as were tables. Was charged differently than other Zoe's. Food took very long to come as we were the only people In the restaurant and it was mediocre at best. No real plates or silverware...it was really kind of lame. Which is disappointing because I love Zoe's."}
{"text":"I like Zoe's Kitchen, even if my call ahead order did not get started until I arrived.  The menu is good for parents and children alike.  It is healthy, delicious and fresh.  Their kabobs, hummus and roll ups are delicious.    The decor inside the restaurant is clean and modern.  I like the orange and white!    They also play popular music at an appropriate level.    So, yes, I waited 20 minutes after arriving to get my food.  But this place is A-OK in my book.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"New location on Scottsdale Road and Acoma on the East side.   Ordered the Salmon Kabobs which came with salad and hummus and also ordered the Chicken Pizza which came with a full salad.  The salmon kabobs were very good and prepared well. Would recommend this item.  Restaurant is new and clean and the employees seem to be constantly cleaning.  There is an expansive ice tea dispenser with a few different flavors to choose from.   At night this location is not the easiest to find as the building is very dark with little signage.   Will probably be back as it is a good alternative"}
{"text":"Serviceable and healthy, if a bit overpriced.  It's the Chipotle of Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Love the spinach roll ups with chicken and hummus. Their new yogurt sauce is delicious ! Great for take out"}
