{"text":"The food was delicious - we shared melted Brie, pizza and nachos. The wine was great too. The atmosphere: marvelous. But the service was very slow, although quite nice."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant located in the old port.   My food was very good, although a little on the pricey side.   Service was good, but extremely slow.   The decor is very nice though!   It was a nice experience, but probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't just walk by this place and think its another tourist trap type restaurant.  It's a great place and the food is amazing if your looking for a quick bite to eat.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience today my wife,daughter and myself were seated in the middle of the restaurant   and we sat there waiting and waiting for someone to take our order we notice other people coming in and also on the outside seating and  getting service after seat we had no utensils or napkins no water nothing.the young lady kept walking back and forth final the young man who seated us came over and ask if we wanted to eat i found that question strange again i let it go after been ignored for so long but i was determine to enjoy my vacation we placed our order and we sat there still no utensils no napkins no water nothing.. Then 2 customers were seated next to us and immediately received everyrhing thats when we  realized we were been ignored and not wanting us there.so we kindly got up and i walked over to the young man who was busy talk to the same young lady and told them we were leaving.. As we headed out the manager ran out begging us to come back and apologizing for her staff been rude...i told her there is no way i am coming back in there and eat..she continued and we walked away..i still cant figure out if the fact that we were American or African American but i am determined to enjoy our vacation and we have met many beautiful people here.. Word of advice DONT GO THERE..BYPASS THIS ESTABLISHMENT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS.. IF I COULD GIVE !!!ZERO STARS I WOULD DO IT IN A HEART BEAT..."}
{"text":"Went to this nice little restaurant during our 2-day family trip to Montreal. The brunch was great and atmosphere was pleasant with live piano music. Although only one block away from the busy tourism site Rue St Paul, it was not crowded even on Sunday. Overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Delicious latte friendly staff and a nice view.. what more could you want with your morning coffee."}
{"text":"This is in a very touristy spot and looks so cute. The staff are lovely but the coffee wasn't great. I ordered the fruit cup as they don't really have any gluten free options. My honey ordered the croissant with brie, apple, and pecans which sounded amazing! Unfortunately, the croissant looked old and stale and he had the hardest time even cutting it. It sounded great but wasn't good. The omelettes looked incredible so if you go there that might be a better option."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed brunch at this cafe. The waffles and hot chocolate were fantastic. The cafe itself is a bit tight, which could be frustrating at peak times. Delicious food, quick service, and a perfect spot to spend a cold, dreary day. They also had a pianist who played pop music, which we really enjoyed. After your meal, you can browse the cool shop next door to round out your day. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the service is friendly. I tried the waffle sandwich and it is now one of my favorite breakfast places in NA."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. My boyfriend had the bacon cheddar avocado omelette($11) and really enjoyed it, though even with the addition of potatoes ($1.75) to the meal, and ordering a flavored latte, he was still hungry.  I ordered the salmon bagel and a filtered coffee. The bagel was pricey, at $16.  The salmon was good, but the bagel itself, while it looked like a bagel, was very bland and tasted more like unsalted bread than a bagel. Overall, it was slightly overpriced for the food, but with the location on the port strip overpriced is not a surprise.  The service was also just okay. We got seated immediately, and servers were friendly, but we had to ask for water three times."}
{"text":"We stumbled up on this in Old Montreal and were SO happy that we stayed. In addition to having the cutest little boutique attached to it, the food did not disappoint.  They have a mango lemon iced tea that is to die for (we had three rounds, including one to go!) and the bread could not have been more fresh. I had the BLT with the green salad and I cannot say enough good things.  Crisy bacon, soft bread, and their signature vinaigrette is heaven.  My friend had the argula salad with proscuitto and was equally impressed.  We sat outside (it was a glorious day) and while the service was a little slow, they were ridiculously nice and accommodating.  Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Delightful spot in Old Montreal.  Perfect for a late lunch/early light supper.  Service was a bit slow but waitstaff was overworked and doing their best.  Sandwiches were delicious and generously sized.  Side green salad was excellent.  Loved the marinated red onion and tangy/sweet house vinaigrette.  Nice selection of local beers. Prices are fair for the quality.  I would go again."}
{"text":"This was the only place that wasn't packed on a Saturday night before the fireworks. *The hours say they close at 8, but they were open past 11 when we were there.*  We grabbed a seat on the terrace and ordered some drinks and pizzas. The sangria was mainly juice and the beer wasn't that cold. The pizza was the opposite; it came out room temperature at best. They also skimped on the toppings and didn't spread to the edges.   I suppose it's not the worst place to eat, but it's definitely not one of the best."}
{"text":"We were hungry for pizza and nothing too heavy. Pizza and salad we enjoyed and both were very tasty. Limited wine by the glass selection. Red sangria was well worth it!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. If you do not order food, they will not serve you. Took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast.  We had the oven baked omelette with avocado. Delicious. The sides were fruit salad or mixed green salad and both were fresh and tasty. The Cronut was amazing and the coffee excellent.  Going back tomorrow to try the waffle sandwich which looked amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with a live pianist! The cronuts are super delicious and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Went in with a friend while walking around old port. Patio was all booked and took a table inside. Decent coffee, not too overpriced. Nachos were nice too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in the old port. Love the ancient interior. They serve really good pizza (better than most pizza places I tried). Especially the one with bacon. I don't recommend sanwitches. Salads could also be a little better. But once again, the pizza justifies it all. If they didn't have piano, I would enjoy it even more."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, fast service in English and French. Nice outdoor seating. I had the waffle and bacon Brie sandwich with fig jam. Awesome."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere with great piano music and delicious food right by the water. What a treat! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great little place!!  I got the veggie sandwich and it was awesome.  Boyfriend got a salad which he really liked.  They had an English menu which is really nice.  A young man was playing the piano while we were there.  He was amazing, played modern pop songs; he didn't even use sheet music.  Everything was decently priced as well.  I would recommend this cute little place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Simple, authentic, yet imaginative, this place is is the perfect combination for an easy lunch, brunch or afternoon break for a hot chocolate, you can relax while listening to some live piano. Ambiance is great and so is the staff."}
{"text":"Just wonderful-- the owner Is lovely and attentive, the servers friendly and the food delicious. We ate here on our wedding anniversary and it was memorable. They had a very talented pianist too!"}
{"text":"The claim as Montréal's best coffee is highly dubious. But, my beef with this little shop and cafe was rude attitude of the owner. After waking up early to drive up to Montréal, we needed a caffeine boost and catch up on social media. The service was lacking from the get-go. We weren't allowed to order at the counter; instead, we had to be seated to order our coffee. From there, we were ignored while we waited to place our order. We had to ask her three times for the wi-fi and even then, she was immediately distrusting of our intentions as she warned us not to download anything on her personal wi-fi. The coffee was also sub-par. I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice? Must be a French-Canadian thing."}
{"text":"Bruschetta bar amazing!  Highly recommend if you are in the area!  Piano player and ambience can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Excellent find for lunch in the center of Old Montreal. Such a neat place and the extra surprise was the live piano player. We ordered the veggie sandwich with quinoa which was absolutely fabulous and the spinach salad. For dessert we had the organic chocolate lava cake and cappuccinos. To sum up our experience-- Ooh la la!!"}
{"text":"One my favorite spots in Montreal so far for lunch. It was a beautiful warm sunny day and we decided to have a seat outside. Our server was very friendly and sweet. We sat and drank our yummy red sangria and took in the view of the Old Port across the street. We ordered the tuna and avocado sandwich and the BLT sandwich. Both of our sandwiches were fantastic and left us very full and content. If you don't like dining outside due to having people stare at what you're having or a few bees flying by, they do have an inside cafe as well with a little boutique attached. The boutique has many different unique items that are great for a gift. We came back here 3 times just to look at stuff over and over again. We ending up buying things on our third trip.   So if you're looking for somewhere to relax and enjoy a few cocktails and some great grub near the Old Port then this is the spot to go to."}
{"text":"Our overall experience was pretty mediocre.   This was a Monday lunch and the place didn't seem so busy. We decided to sit outside. The two servers seemed to be overly booked and it took a while before we received the menus. The service was slow but friendly. She apologized for the late service.   My husband ordered fig goat cheese bruschetta. Meh. I ordered spring salad. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a rainy day - I fell in love with the cafe but wouldn't go here for an entire meal. We got appetizers and coffee and both were wonderful (melted Brie is a must have!) it is pricey for the sizes of the dish but you definitely pay for the experience.   The location, atmosphere and shop next door make the place worth while. The piano player was simply wonderful, everyone enjoyed the music and he played off the guests which was awesome. You can see the water from the windows and the decor is exactly what you might want from a small bistro.  The staff is extremely friendly, they made a table from us (as in took a table from the back to let us sit down) and were friendly and attentive. The service is a little slow but I think for a place like this you can just say \"who cares?\" You go to this Bistro for the good food and even better atmosphere."}
{"text":"The omelets are simply amazing. Great view, great atmosphere and great staff. We will definitely eat breakfast here each time we visit. It has indoor and outdoor seating with views of the river, port and parks. Nicely located if you are visiting the Old Port area."}
{"text":"Sitting outside under the umbrellas with a glass of wine, a tasty pizza, and a delish sandwich.   Friendly service and good prices. Kicking back on vacation. Life is good.  One afternoon while exploring the Old Port part of town we decided to grab some lunch here. As we were sitting outside under the umbrellas on the front patio area the skies opened up and the rain came down. We made a quick retreat with our food and drink to the inside restaurant.  Either way it worked out great. The inside cafe has a terrific cozy decor which was very inviting. Kind of a rustic Parisian feel. Piano in the center. Clean bathroom too.  On the other side is a small boutique shop with all kinds of home goods and miscellaneous items. Nice spot to pick up a gift.  Again, the service was friendly and they leave you be to have time to relax and enjoy your meal. Some say the service is slow, but for a couple like us on vacation and not in a rush it was just right.  Oh, and the food is pretty decent here. Tasty bruschetta with fig compote, a delish pizza with  a smoky cheese flavor, and a tuna with avocado sandwich with a side of quinoa that was solid. Really good choices for a lunch that hit the spot before heading out for more adventure.  Oh, and we had to try out that Montreal 1642 Cola. It's a strange taste but kind of addicting."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. This place looks absolutely wonderful on yelp, only it is impossible to find. When I walked into the store, I asked about the bistro and the woman working had no idea what I was talking about. I'm not sure this restaurant exists."}
{"text":"If you've found that life has lost some of its joie... drop by this unique little gem and order the croissant au chocolat or waffle - and then wait for the sunlight to stream into your soul. The food...the service...the setting... all seasoned with love..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant because I want to love it but it doesn't always deliver. Here's why;  The food: I have tried 3-4 different sandwiches on the menu and they were all delicious. However, last time I was there I decided to try something different and have the baked mac n cheese. Horrible idea. Not only was it tiny and overpriced, it was also freezing cold in the middle. When I brought this up to my server, she took back the plate and put it in the microwave... Needless to say putting a baked meal in the microwave isn't the best idea in the world haha. It was gross. I didn't eat the rest.   The location: Right in the heart of the Old Port, a few steps away from the science museum. When you walk in it can be a bit confusing because it's a tiny store but has a restaurant attached to it (on the right when you walk in). Cute decor and they even have a piano with people playing live from time to time.  The service: Usually decent and friendly although I did have one really bad experience with a waitress who had no idea what she was doing and took 15 minutes to bring me my check in a completely empty restaurant."}
{"text":"My children had the cronut and my wife and I had wine. The Cabernet seemed old and it was red.  Decent spot, understaffed."}
{"text":"Cute place. Friendly service. Good food.   Ever been so tired and hungry that you can't decide what to eat and you wander around just getting hungrier and grumpier? That was us.  My wife found this place and we stopped in. Wonderful environment and sweet server greeted us.  We ordered the melted Brie appetizer with walnuts and cranberries. Sooooo good.  After that we split a yummy margherita pizza and a sandwich with fresh tomato and mozzarella. Everything hit the spot. And SURPRISE?, the piano player we loved from The Stash Cafe was playing for the lunch crowd.   The food was not awe-inspiring, ( except for the Brie), but very good. A perfect lunch place."}
{"text":"La meilleure sandwiches au poulet du vieux port de Montréal. Belle ambiance,bon service, prix raisonnable. Aussi terrasse sur de la commune coin St Laurent"}
{"text":"Just happened to find this place as a refuge from the rain and snow today. Thank goodness! It was great!  We shared nachos and Mac n cheese. Both were great and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Sitting by the window overlooking the street was lovely. Their claim for the best coffee was true! I have been travelling the USA for 6 weeks and the coffee is terrible.... BUT here it was fantastic!!! At last great coffee!!!  Service was fine and atmosphere great with quaint store next door."}
{"text":"The space is gorgeous!!! I would even say magical. I stumbled upon this cafe while walking from our hotel along Old Port. We wanted a quick bite before our dinner and decided to stop here for a latte and sandwiches. The space was beautiful and had an amazing atmosphere with stone walls and exposed wooden beams in the ceiling draped with greenery and industrial lights. My boyfriend ordered the prosciutto sandwich and I had the tuna salad sandwich. Both came with a simple side salad that was so delicious!!! Although this place is quite pricey, it had good food and great decor and over looked Old Port and it's beautiful views. I highly recommend and definitely will be back!!"}
