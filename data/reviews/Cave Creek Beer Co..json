{"text":"Bad service. Took over an hour to get drinks. After we got them, staff disappeared and never came back. After another 45 min., we left without ordering anything else."}
{"text":"Had the feast #1 and it was amazingly perfect all the way around.   My wife had the sea bass and said it was the best she has ever eaten.  Great easy going atmosphere with very friendly owners.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were sent here by friends and met Katie and Jamie (the owners) and wow! Awesome people! Great drinks, and great food. I don't eat seafood, but hubby does and had the feast #2, and I had a steak from the Indigo Crow downstairs. Our food was top notch, and the location and service was really great. I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We took a large party for a birthday this evening. The atmosphere was great. The service was absolutely horrible. We had to ask for plates and silverware. It took over 2 hours for our food. The oysters we ordered as appetizers had grit and small pieces of shell in them. We had to return them. We had to pay $1 for each piece of bread. We spent over $600 for a table of 8 and trust me when I say we are not big eaters. For that price I expect quality service, food, and atmosphere. The only reason I am giving the place 2 stars is for the atmosphere. I will never return there again or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had a beautiful night on the patio w my wife!  We were greeted nicely and told that we can sit anywhere and that it's a \"casual bar service\" (we needed to order from the bar if we wanted anything besides a drink).  We ordered the ahi poke for an appetizer and it was so good!  Lots of flavor and fresh!  Then we had the Creole combo pot of crab, shrimp, mussels, corn, etc. and it was great!  Who would of thought that you could get great seafood in Cave Creek?"}
{"text":"Great place for seafood and beer and I enjoyed the happy hour menu. Everything tasted amazing and they had a great kids menu that my kids enjoyed. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the views. I look forward to going back. The decor and vibe were a plus too."}
{"text":"Great place to check out. Great seafood! We went to go try out indigo crow last night and wound up here. Maybe local know about it but I was pleasantly confused at the situation. We ended up having a delicious dinner of crab legs, prawns and mussels. 

Beautiful setting on the balcony.

Downfalls, the owner admitted to being short handed and service was a little slow, having to ask for utensils and napkins. But they were super pleasant about it. 

A definite return back to location."}
