{"text":"Centro is a modern little café facing Boots in the Ladysmith Centre. It is a little expensive, you can expect to pay around £10 for two Panini's and two drinks.


 They used to make sandwiches to order but now they are all preprepared which I think is a real shame because it was great being able to choose what you wanted on the sandwich and know that it was all freshly made in front of you.


 The Panini's are very nice, they do have quite a good selection. They also have a selection of cakes but I've never really enjoyed any cake I've had there, they generally taste like they've been sat there for days.


 They drinks are always really nice, the hot chocolate is absolutely gorgeous, I have it with cream and marshmallows and I just love them. The freshly squeezed orange is really refreshing, I'd suggest having it with ice though otherwise it's really warm. The smoothies are gorgeous, really tasty.


 The café is always really clean and I love the red corner chairs, I always sit there if I can. The staff are very friendly. I like the fact that because it's a little bit more expensive than your average café, it keeps groups of teenagers out so you can have a brew and something to eat in peace."}
{"text":"loverly coffees here but a bit on the dear side for me"}
{"text":"Lovely plush seating and nice friendly atmosphere. You can sit outside under the many patio hetaers if you like. The coffees and cakes are great ,but cost more than anyother cafe in the area. You pay for the plush seating i think"}
{"text":"Up until a few years ago I always used to think to myself that Ashton town centre really lacked a good coffee shop, then low and behold one day I'm strolling through the main arcade and I see what looks like a new funky new coffee shop called Centro with the sign 'Opening Soon' which filled me with an eager anticipation of what could be!


 When it did open I was delighted to see that it was so different from the other coffee shops which were in the town at the time. This was a world away from soup like coffee in a chipped mug with the most exotic food being a toasted tea cake.


 It struck me as bright, light and modern and exactly the kind of place the town had been needing.


 It's now a few years on and at least one change of ownership hands for Centro, the décor has changed little inside and though I did still like it, I think some items of furniture are showing their wear.


 Its seating and table layout is non-traditional with comfy corner chairs, 'L' shaped sofas, unusual tables with some kind of liquid which moves under the glass and more leather than a Foreigner concert!


 They have a really good range of coffees and several different kinds of teas. I've had some of their fruit smoothies, what are also quite tasty.


 I find it disappointing that most of the food they offer is of the pre packed variety that you find at the usual major coffee shop chains, it would be nicer if they have freshly prepared sandwiches as they are a privately owned business and it could really distinguish them from everyone else. On the flip side I do like the bread they use for toasting, its sizeable and tastes good.


 My only other gripe is the staff, most of them are either too young or uninterested (or both) in working there that it really stops being a slick operation, I mean sometimes your lucky to even get a smile off a member of staff. It feels much more amateur compared to the big boys on the High St (Costa's etc)


 I usually come here not because of the mediocre service but because I would rather avoid the chain places, but when the independents stop making an effort with such major themes as food and service then they are playing into their competitors hands.


 For the casual coffee shop user though, you would no doubt find it a welcome break and a break from the frappuccino norm!"}
