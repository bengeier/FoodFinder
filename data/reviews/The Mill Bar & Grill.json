{"text":"We went to the The Mill on Thursday July 7 during the weekly free concert at the Unionville Bandstand.  We thought it would be nice to sit on the patio/deck at the Mill and listen to the music from across the street while having a few drinks.  Well we could hear the music just fine....but the deck was a dump.  The mill pond adjacent to the deck is a disgusting cess pool.  Hopefully the owners of The Mill can convince their landlord to clean up this smelly, algae clogged sludge pit.  I remember in years past when the mill pond was properly aerated and maintained.  What happened? Also, the deck was messy, with dirty napkins strewn about.  Some of the umbrellas were broken and looked quite ghetto.   The large awning was mildew stained and kinda gross.  By our table, just beside the railing, was an old bucket filled with old water bottles and piles of cigarette butts.  Charming.   The walkway between the main building and the patio area was littered  with cigarette butts.  Uggh.  Haven't you guys heard of a shop vac?  The service during our stay was mediocre, but in fairness, they got slammed suddenly with a rush of people after the free concert concluded and didn't have many servers on shift to handle the sudden rush  I will assume that the service isn't always that poor.  I took a peek inside the Bar, and it looked quite decent.  Clean, well appointed and welcoming.  A stark difference from their outdoor area.   You would think that in the heart of Unionville some effort would be expended on the little things, like cleanliness and d√©cor.  I am sure that a lot of people considering entering the bar from the deck side have second thoughts and turn around and go elsewhere.   I will have trouble convincing my spouse to try this place again.  So much potential for an awesome deck experience.  None of it realized."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, I went for dinner with a friend a couple days ago and we waited an HOUR for our food. And when our food arrived it wasnt that good, and the portions were small. When we ordered drinks the witress was walking around to see which table it belonged to. I will never go back, the witress was so unprofessional, she told my friend and I she was hiding in the back because she was tried and didn't want to go out and serve people...."}
{"text":"Sorry, tried it twice now and won't be returning. very limited menu, mediocre food and extremely slow service.   The ambience in dining area is lacking as it is set up more like a cafeteria and the patio is a breeding ground for the mosquitoes."}
{"text":"Went back after being disappointed the last time we visited and was pleasantly surprised! The food was great, although the wait was a bit long. Suggest going for lunch, catching the game, or a nice day on there great patio."}
{"text":"I have been to this place the last two Saturdays for lunch. Both times we were blessed with good weather and sat on the patio under the umbrella by the little river. I don't know what the patio would be like in the evening with the river (creek) under but you can always sit inside.  This restaurant is under new ownership, so don't confuse it with the old Dragon something pub. I believe a father and son (Dominic and Stefano) run the place. One of them usually comes by and greets you at the end. The food is fairly good and I believe it's a good value. It is not award winning but it certainly is not average either. I love the location as we live in Unionville and we frequent the main street and its nice restaurants, this now being one of them.  The service has been very friendly. Not formal to be uncomfortable, just genuine friendly service. The food is like home made so don't expect to be in and out quickly. The presentation of their food is always great. The burger/fries look amazing. The Salmon dish (there is only one) is great. They are flexible if you have a special diet like mine. You can pick any salad and add any meat to it. The Fish and chips are good too as my son loved it. The first time we were 6 people and everyone liked their food.  I like the fact that the menu is small and makes the decisions easy. It does offer a good variety regardless. I didn't try the nachos but it looked great. That is on my list for next visit. The prosciutto & cheese plate looked very nice but that is not in my diet. I may end up doing the sin before the summer's end though. Perhaps on a day I have a tennis tournament at night. Another menu item that looked great was the shrimp and chorizo pasta. Another item for next times. If you are walking down the main street, give this a try and let me know how it was."}
{"text":"we stumbled across this place as we were driving to get coffee and ice cream.  we sat on the patio and and a drink, I liked the laid back atmosphere and nice venue.  the service was great and I would return again!   only downside is that there's water around which attracts Mosquitos in the evening and I got eaten alive!"}
{"text":"I was worried to try this place again after its changed hands so many times and i have sent SOOOO many meals back for the previous owners. But now this reincarnation is great. Amazing lighting, great food, and best of all on Wednesdays they have free open mike night thanks to Kevin Ker !!!! Thanks- my family loved it and my son is performing next week :)"}
{"text":"First time I've ever been here, despite coming to Main Street Unionville quite a bit. Was in the mood for something on a patio, but didn't want it to be too busy, so we ended up here.   Patio is quite nice, located right beside a little pond and mill. With the restaurant being further down the street, it definitely felt less busy overall. The patio seating was plentiful, but they had these torches for when it got colder/later, but the wind would blow the smoke right into our faces. Not something I would have wanted for the entire night.   Wasn't all too hungry, so got the Fish and Chips. The fish was battered very nicely and paired well with the house made tartar sauce. The fries were a bit soggy though.   The service was pretty good, as our server was super nice. Kept apologizing as it was apparently her first night. However, the patio was quite large and the amount of attention to our table was limited. May have been due to the lack of staff on a Friday night.   All in all a good place to kick back on a nice day. Also a huge plus to get the 15% off check in offer for the entree!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed  This restaurant is located in a very pleasant town and has wonderful decor with vintage mirrors and beautiful chandeliers.  That's about the best I can say about this restaurant. The service was very poor. This is my first time writing a bad review. Never had such an experience. We wanted to celebrate mothers day in what seemed like a nice place but our food took 50 minutes to come. We ordered fish and chips, 3 pizzas and ravioli. Nothing complicated. People who came after us got their food before us.  When the food finally arrived we mentioned to the manager that it took quite a while to arrive. Instead of apologizing for the wait (which is all that was necessary) they came back with a piece of paper and told us the food took 47 minutes to be ready and that it was very busy which was why it took longer. The fish and chips came 7 minutes after all the other food which I don't understand... it was the easiest order.  There were about 3-4 tables during this time. Not busy at all considering they have a big open space for a bar(empty)  and a patio.  Our food was hardly even warm.  We noticed each mother left with a red rose that evening which was given before the payment.  We left with no rose although I saw they had some left. I had seen the server pick up a rose then put it down.  An apology for the wait would have been nice. As we left we receieved no recognition from neither of the servers nor the manager we spoke to.  Our evening was tinged with disappointment and on mothers day too."}
{"text":"Fantastic location for great weather, however you are unlikely to get any kind of service. We had to seat ourselves, and the waiter sprayed Off! for another table near us (we were sitting on the patio) while we were eating, and the smell totally spoils your appetite. The food was decent, but the presentation is poor."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food was good especially the avocado spring rolls"}
{"text":"Came here to use a Groupon for $30 worth of food. They have a lovely patio and it was a great spot to have dinner and listen in on the Thursday night live music playing at the nearby bandshell. We also opted to sit outside as the dining area is seemingly not air conditioned. Aside from the Thursday night live music on Main Street, the Mill has their own live musical entertainment on Thursdays as well.  We ordered the pear and goat cheese salad to share, the chorizo & shrimp pappardelle, and the seared salmon with asparagus and wild rice. The salad was generous in size and had lots of dried cranberries, walnuts, pear strips, and goat cheese. The salmon was slightly overcooked but had a nice crispy skin. The pappardelle was delicious with a decent amount of large shrimps and chorizo. I recommend! For dessert we shared a slice of Godiva cheesecake.  It is worth coming to the Mill Bar & Grill for the solid food, the large patio, plus there are 2 Poke Stops at this restaurant and an abundance of Poke Stops and gyms nearby. Oh and don't forget to check in and you'll get 15% off your entree. 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and didn't realize there was live music.   We had a toddler in tow and the server was super accommodating to our requests about potentially moving to a quieter table.   They even had a booster seat all set up without asking before we arrived but we didn't use it (we called ahead of time and brought our own seat). Overall service was great. The food was also great and came really quick (we were one of the first orders of the night). We ordered the pappardelle which was yummy and the funghi pizza.  The pappardelle still had a nice al dente bite to it and the sauce was tangy and creamy but not heavy. Would order again. The pizza was intensely earthy and mushroomy.  Pizza crust was thin and also was crispy on the bottom.  Another \"would order again\".  Thanks for a delightful night!"}
{"text":"I have been to the mills two times, both times late at night when their kitchen was formally closed. However, they are soooo nice, that they agreed to serve a few items from their menu, both times!! The server himself made us food the second time.  FOOD:   NACHOS!!! Best nachos i have ever had, although its listed as an appetizer, it can easily be shared as a whole meal between two people. We asked the chef/server to put chicken in our nachos and they generously complied. Also, it had soooo much cheese and jalapenos ( My mouth waters as i write this review).  Wings: Spiciest thing i have ever had in toronto.(no pun intended)  Their suicide wings made me cry, i have never been this satisfied by something \"spicy\". I grew up eating spicy food, so if i am saying they are spicy, you bet they were spicy! Wash your hand twice after eating them ;)  Ambianc/Service  Good lightning, old british style telephone both, and a few interesting paintings.  i can't say much about the service as we kinda interacted with the chef directly one time, and the second time we did a takeaway, but i highly doubt if there service would be anything but great."}
{"text":"21.50 for a pitcher of Canadian?! Completely honest review here. I've lived in unionville for years and have frequented everything up and down the strip. The mill is a great spot to come by for lunch, dinner, some mid day drinks, but when it gets late and you wanna grab a drink its... Gross. Very older crowd always completely wasted, the bathroom doesn't get cleaned at all, seriously gross. The wheelchair access bathroom door is so hard to open and close I don't know how someone in one could possibly manage. For a place with such history, in such a nice spot, with such ridiculous prices for drinks, you would think they would put some effort into their upkeep.  Seriously unimpressed. It's gone so downhill over the years. The pond is, is so disgusting now which is honestly the only reason to come here over any other bar. Ksidocowaidovofskc nasty AF."}
{"text":"This place is a lot larger than I thought. One side of the restaurant is bar and there is another dining area in the back which is really nice.  Soup of the day - lentil and bacon soup $6 - There were chunks of bacon in the soup. They looked like little chunks of BBQ that you get at a Chinese BBQ joint. The soup was really good. Not overly salty.  Honey garlic wings $12 - They tasted like BBQ grilled wings with honey sauce. The wings were small but tasted good. The skin was not crispy which was the only negative point about the wings.  Ruben $14 - lots of smoked meat. Nothing really special about it though. I wish there was more sauerkraut in the sandwich. Came with a good portion of fries.   Pioneer burger $17 - the rib meat was really good and went well with the pretzel bun which was soft and had nice chew to it. The meat was thick and juicy + it was really filling. Also came with a good portion of fries.  There were not a lot of customers so service was excellent. The place was clean and I like how they decorated the place. It had a horror flick feel to it. Many spooky mirrors displayed all around and the chandelier had a cool looking black veil around it."}
{"text":"Four stars for service and our server was very attentive and answered any questions we had about the menu. She came back to check on us and she made our lunch here an enjoyable experience. This was our first time dining here and I definitely will come back to try other items on the menu.   The food was massive, I got the Pioneer Burger with fries for 18.00$ and it was worth the price. It was juicy and the cook did not skimp on ingredients. It was a very filling but tasty burger!   The Spaghetti Bolognese was one of their specials, I forgot the price but around 12-15$. It was a good portion for sharing. It had good flavours and cooked perfectly.  This restaurant is worth checking out, if you check in using the Yelp app you can get 15% off the entree section in the menu. So that's a bonus. The food is about 3.5 stars out of 5 but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"My Cheese and Meat Plate came with rotten salad leaves, nasty stuff. I complained and they took the order off my bill."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. This is the first time I feel so enraged I am compelled to write a review before leaving the restaurant. My mother in law picked this restaurant for Mothers Day dinner because of the line up she sees on the weekend.   We are a party of 11 and ordered the Rueben, Mussels, Mushroom Ravioli, Salmon, Tuna Steak Salad including doubles of some items. Portion was inconsistent, salmon was dry, ravioli was drenched in an unnecessarily heavy cream sauce, and the salads took forever to come with  - they were served when the rest of the family were half done, and the tardiness came without an apology. It was a stale, seared tuna steak that was dry and salty. Our server disappeared after the meal was served, our water went unrefilled for over an hour, and the best part? The best part was when the same server decided to drop off dessert menus without saying a word or making any eye contact.  I have been disappointed a few times before and this one is the worst experience. That probably explains why this restaurant was not even at half capacity on mother's day weekend."}
{"text":"Menu seems to be very limited and very basic....the place has improved with its looks a good make over and the ipad ordering system is up to date.  Wont go here for food again just for drink in the patio"}
{"text":"The place is outstanding. The mussels were great in the white wine sauce with onions and cherry tomatoes. I had the Ruben which was very good with their kettle chips. They also have some Cheesecake Factory desserts. The service was very good. I think the waitress was Caitlin. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I came here with my family and we ordered steak, pappardelle, and salmon.   The steak dish was phenomenal! I loved the mash potatoes, the mushroom, the bacon, the asparagus, the steak- everything. I would definitely purchase this the next time I check in.  The salmon was pretty good, crispy and tender served on a bed of wild rice.   The rose sauce pappardelle with chorizo was quite spicy, although its a spicy that I can handle. I have to say though, I was quite impressed with this as well  Service was a tad slow, but very friendly nonetheless. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"I have watched this restaurant change hands numerous times over the last decade and now with the enticement of a Groupon deal, I've decided to give it a shot.  The Mills is part of a small strip mall near one end of main street Unionville. There is a small mill to The left of the entrance. I've seen it in action but mostly during warmer weather. The exterior looks quite nice but the pond has gotten very gross over the years. Upon entering, there's a small area with very cute retro decor! To the left is the bar and the right side is for dining. The entire restaurant is quite small altogether. Overall, the dining room area was a chic  vib with its stylish chandeliers, and the bar area is more relaxed with all its flat screen tvs and a foosball table.   Moving on to the food! All in all, it was alright. The highlight was the Pioneer burger. Big thick juicy patty on a pretzel bun! Yummy! A bit on the pricier end but with the Groupon, it was a definitely worth trying. We substituted for sweet potato fries and this was sort of where the disappointment started. The fries were only warm...slightly warm really. Tasted alright but definitely gives us the impression that it's not freshly prepared. The dipping sauce that came it was a little sour for my liking. I don't even really know what it is actually. I recommend sticking to the ketchup. I ordered the prosciutto pizza. It was just ok. I've had much better elsewhere. Thin crust but a little hard. I wouldn't recommend getting this pizza.   Now as for service, waitress was bubbly and friendly. Service was on the slow side but I won't pinpoint this on the waitress since she was the only one serving the entire dining area and there was a large party there. Only pet peeve of the evening was when I asked for warm water and got hot water. Warm shouldn't mean scalding-my-finger temperature. I just asked for cold water and mixed it myself. Don't like to be a fuss."}
{"text":"Well I guess I can start of to mention how horrible the service is. We always had to get the waiters attention for her to come over, other than that she never did. She was nice but super slow.  We just ordered a couple drinks and got an appetizer. I personally liked the calamari. However, just to order a few drinks and the calamari took forever, and there were 3 waitresses! We asked her for water and she only brang one? It was only my boyfriend & I, and a group of 4 men on another table..   Also, we sat outside at first, but their patio faces a small river with a fountain that smells so bad! I don't know how one can sit near there to drink or eat."}
{"text":"This place is okay at best. Good to come here when all the other places on main are fully booked. It's your typical bar with a decent kitchen.   The food is good. But definitely overpriced for what it is.. But that's the norm on main. So it's expected.   French fries are decently good.   Be forewarned their menu is very very limited. Also, avoid the patio, it's as if they don't give a crap about it. Old peeling wood, broken umbrellas, horrendous foul smelling pond. Not what I want to see and smell when I'm hungry for food."}
