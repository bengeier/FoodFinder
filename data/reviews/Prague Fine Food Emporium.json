{"text":"Heard a lot of this place, so decided to check it out on a Friday night. We got there around 7pm, the place was barely empty. We went ahead and order perogies, goulash and cabbage rolls. Although fresh, the perogies did not stand out very much. The Goulash was lacking any flavour. However, the cabbage rolls were somewhat flavourful and hearty.  We decided to try our luck at Hungarian crepe with hazelnut, which was not bad.  Overall, I was expecting more from this staple establishment."}
{"text":"I come in here a lot to hit their takeout counter. really good assortment of sandwhiches and Czech pastries/takehomes. Don't expect a smile from the person making your delicio food tho."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Server was really friendly and the food was great. I recommend the Czech-Break it was delicious! Toilets were nice & clean too, always a good sign"}
{"text":"Not a Czech restaurant anymore. None of the dishes have any resemblance to any actual traditional Czech food. The quality of the food is fine I guess, but a bit disappointing for someone looking for a Czech dish. Nothing special at all.  Based on the previous reviews the original Prague Restaurant must have been a jewel for decades! It really is a pity, that the concept was so drastically changed with the new owner."}
{"text":"I'd seen all the good reviews for this place so I figured I'd give it a try. We both ordered the schnitzel. We were immediately disappointed when we saw her put the food in a MICROWAVE. Sorry, but schnitzel's should be fried to order, not pre-fried and reheated. In fact, any restaurant that microwaves their food is ripping you off. Because of this, the schnitzel was chewy and the skin was soft and kind of soggy. This place looks like a good grocery store, especially if you're looking for harder-to-find European foods, but I certainly won't be dining there ever again."}
{"text":"Had an excellent schnitzel sandwich here. A lot of options in terms of buns/toppings (get sauerkraut) and a very reasonable price point (about 7 or 8 bucks). Unlike the breaded veal you'll get at Italian places around the city, the meat here is much denser and less reliant on the fried exterior.   Service was prompt, goulash and bread puddings were both enjoyable and although didn't try it - the Czech allday breakfast with Kielbasa, dumplings, and eggs looked wicked.  Czech-please!  Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"We live in Mississauga but every weekend we drive in just to have lunch there. Food is excellent. Service is great. Worth the drive.  Just had another fabulous meal there!!!  Tripe Soup, Wiener Schnitzel, Liver Pudding, and the pastries are amazing!!  Everything done on premises.  The best part, they have frozen food goodness to take home!!!"}
{"text":"Very lovely local atmosphere, good service, Nice bakery and pastry sections with delicious cakes... As main course for dinner, we had Chicken and veggie Schnitzels, delicious but nothing very special.   I will definitely come back for Brunch and update my review then."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go to the Prague forever, but somehow was never in the mood for Central European comfort food when in the Queen W. neighbourhood. Until yesterday, when I had dinner plans with my pal JN, who - like me - is a veteran of Mitteleuropa.  We got there about quarter past six, to find out that the place closes at seven - so a long catch-up over dinner was pretty much out. The menu is full of Czech stand-bys such as svicková (beef in creamy sauce), fried cheese, roast pork, sauerkraut, etc. - all very authentic. So far so good.  We both ordered the smoked salmon appetizer - house-smoked salmon was excellent, a good start to the meal.  And then we got our mains. Both the svicková and the blood sausage with potatoes and sauerkraut were bland, bland, bland. Liberal application of Czech mustard helped my blood sausage a bit... But we both agreed that on the scale of post-communist Central European development, our dinner was somewhere around 1995. Better than 1989... but not up to snuff by today's standards.  Sadly, by the time we got to dessert, the kitchen was closed and they couldn't make palacinky - stuffed crepes. And my vanilla-custard-filled Czech donut was... well, I only ate half, and I never leave dessert unfinished.  So why does the Prague get three stars and not two? The service was friendly and warm - indeed, delightful. They let us stay long past closing as they cleaned up.  And the Slovak beer was excellent."}
{"text":"Everything was bland.  There so-called fresh squeezed orange juice, didn't taste fresh.  Their ice cream tasted cheap; definitely not home-made.  Their perogies were bland; I can make better ones at home by opening a bag I bought at No Frills.  Their goulash was bland as well.  The waitress was friendly.    Decor was of the routine modern genre."}
{"text":"Had breakfast on a saturday before heading off to the library. Omelette was amazing. Salmon was extremely good. Waitress was very friendly and nice. We ordered two main dishes, a side dish and two coffees for $34. For that great food, i was easily willing to pay 50. A place I will definitely come back to"}
{"text":"Never been here before. We were headed to Terroni (gluttons for punishments) but I wanted to duck inside and see what this place was all about.  The service was haphazard, but I suppose friendly.  The server told us it was her third shift.  She kept forgetting what we had ordered, as she had \"only two hours sleep\".  Only two other tables in the place, and I'm pretty sure the couple in the window were the server's friends.  My dining companion ordered pork schnitzel, and she gave him a pork schnitzel sandwich -- he had wanted just regular pork schnitzel.  He didn't say anything to correct it though (and I'm not one to pipe in on behalf of someone else in that situation).    I did really like the appetizer perogies - hot, fresh, and delicious.  However, they took 45 minutes to come out.  Yes, you read that right.  Maybe Terroni's isn't such an insane choice after all...."}
{"text":"Went to this nice and homie place with great expectation. I wasn't disappointed. Take out food available as well. Fairly priced. Will be back"}
{"text":"Prague is always one of my favourite places to go for a bacon-and-eggs breakfast in Toronto, and I've spent countless hours sitting at the counter by the window, alone, drinking coffee, eating my breakfast (although, to be fair, it's usually afternoon), and reading books. This is a family-owned business which, if the photos on the walls tell the correct story, seems to have been a butcher shop originally. Now they're a restaurant, bakery, and small grocer - you can pick up items ilke Eastern European chocolate bars, bags of perogies to take home, and even homemade plum preserves, delicious on buttered toast.  Prague's menu, in addition to the all day breakfast, has traditional items like pork roast with dumplings; they also make a killer eggplant schnitzel and if you've got room for dessert, do not miss the strawberry dumplings topped with quark cheese - they're absolutely heavenly."}
{"text":"Sadly, upon my return to Prague things have changed..   It was dead quiet in the middle of the week at lunch time which is unheard of at Prague. We were seated immediately (which was nice).. all three of us ordered the all day breakfast, each with our eggs cooked differently. Needless to say, all of the eggs came out over-hard, which none of us had ordered. We were all a little too shy to say anything but the waitress could tell something was up. She offered to change our eggs (which was really nice) but we were hungry and in a rush so refused. The rest of the food wasn't great either- toast was cold, potatoes were really salty and the kiabasa (sp?) sausage was hard. Luckily we had ordered a side Czech potato salad which was delicious as per usual.. we devoured it!  I usually crave Prague when I am away and insist on having it upon my returns to Toronto.. may have to find somewhere new :("}
{"text":"Incredible schnitzel and absolutely delicious smoked salmon. I love the mix between a grocery store and restaurant.   worth Czech-ing out ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for perogies the other day. Just perogies. I could have eaten all day. They were amazing.    The shop is rather small and it makes it cute and cozy. They took care of all 13 of us...who just came because we heard the perogies were good. Several plates of perogies and 89 cent pops later, we came out happy and satisfied.   Now I can say I've been to Prague...and THE Prague.  ;)"}
{"text":"The Prague is located among the countless other restaurants, galleries and cafes that litter the street on Queen West. I chose this place at random, based on the name and interesting advertising. I was very thrilled to find that the food was not only delicious and affordable but the service was exceptional. The Prague has a great atmosphere that is very spacious and artsy. The menu offers an array of food that is exotic and elaborate, leaving you baffled with variety.   Maybe its just the Canadian mentality, or maybe I am just used to angry and rude Philadelphians, but our waiter was unusually nice and helpful. He took the time to draw a map and give us multiple suggestions on where to eat for dinner, sites to visit and bars to check out. He also took the time to crack jokes and give us the name and # of friends he had in the restaurant business who he claimed would hook us up if we mentioned his name. This type of hospitality is strange to me but I have to admit I like it. Ohhhhhhh Canadaaaaaa!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the new ownership and if you were recently given a gift certificate.  While I had heard rumblings of new management at Prague for sometime (It was said on message boards they were trying to sell the business) I didn't think it was a done deal because the name remains the same.  However, when we tried to use a gift certificate that was given to us we were told by the new owner that he did not authorize the sale of these gift certificates and it would come out of his pocket directly.  He tried to tell me that the name has changed a bit but that's besides the point.  The actual signage still says Prague and you retain the fixtures and setup.  In the very least he should absorb the costs as what happens when you buy an existing business.  I won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"In addition to a bewildering array of Eastern European ingredients, deli items, and prepared foods, the Emporium serves up a refreshingly different selection of Czech brunch dishes in its small dining area -- a welcome alternative to two-egg breakfasts, waffles, and omelettes.  My recent breakfast here was one of the most memorable meals I've had in Toronto in quite some time.  I wouldn't describe me as a breakfast fan, since I find that most affordable brunch places are much of a much, but the Emporium sets itself apart with its varied menu, pleasant service, and careful execution, all at a very reasonable price.  The Czech-break, a mix of kielbasa, bread dumpling, and eggs, was lightly seasoned and, despite its meat-and-starch base, not stomach-leadening.  The kielbasa was delicious and the chunks of bread dumpling were the right texture, neither chewy nor gluey.  My favourite, though, was the palacinky (crepe) stuffed with fruit and topped with yogurt and blueberry compote.  Very much on the lighter side of crepe dishes, and a far cry from the typical sweet-on-sweet combo of syrupy fruit topping smothered in whipped cream.  The combination of tart yogurt and pleasant natural sweetness of the fresh fruit was refreshing.  Our server was friendly, funny, polite, and swift.  I really couldn't have asked for a better experience and it is nice to see an established restaurant that is still putting in a strong effort to please and attract new customers.  Well done!  I can't wait to try their lunches and prepared deli items."}
{"text":"Never again! I have been visiting this place regularly for over 20 years, although only every couple months since I don't live in Toronto directly. But I have made sure that I go there every time I am in town. If you are looking for traditional Czech food then forget it! Menu has been reduced and transformed to something that has a very little resemblance to traditional food Czechoslovakians crave. Staple dishes like svickova or vepro-knedlo-zelo are gone forever. This place just became one of hundreds of boring places all over the city that have nothing special about them. They should rename place to something else, calling it Prague is deceiving..."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT HAS CLOSED  Unfortunately the renovations did not go over well. I truly wish they would've left it alone. Now the original place that was a special spot in the neighbourhood is gone forever.   http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/deathwatch/2013/01/21/prague-european-kitchen-closes/"}
{"text":"When I come back from traveling abroad I ease the sad but inevitable transition of returning home by enjoying breakfast at Prague -- a little piece of Europe right on Queen St.  Prague offers up traditional Eastern European Fare from Chicken Paprikesh - chicken sauteed in a creamy smoked paprika sauce - to a variety of savory or sweet crepes, to Kielbasa and eggs.    The staff is not a bunch of built boys and bodacious babes.  Rather the place is housed by real women, middle aged and staunchly middle Eastern.  The food is excellent and the place is fun.  My one complaint is they clearly did a face lift to the joint a few years back and I never got to see it in its original glory.  Oh well can't have everything."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was completely awful. We arrived to a half full restaurant for brunch, and ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food, while every other table that was seated after us was served. When our food finally arrived, one of the orders was completely wrong, and took another half an hour to cone out. The staff was totally unapologetic, and different waiters kept implying we should be leaving while waiting for the corrected order.  All in all, the food was good, but not good enough to warrant spending two hours sitting in a deli."}
{"text":"Went there for a Sunday brunch. Should have taken cabbage, perhaps. Ended up with common sandwiches, salmon or chicken schnitzel. Nothing exceptional. 2.5.   Staff is OK and quite nice. Place gets easily too noisy."}
{"text":"I don't know what my attraction is to hearty, rib-sticking Eastern European food is; it can't be very good for me but I still get cravings. Prague is at its best with its soups, its goulashes .... and, more than ANYTHING else, their potato dumplings stuffed with smoked meat, covered with crispy bacon bits and served with red cabbage on the side. The dumplings are a special that's offered once every week or two. Can't miss with the perogies and the palacinky either.   While I love the energy and vibe of Queen West, amidst all the wonderful hipster joints, I really love that there's an oasis of old-world comfort like The Prague"}
{"text":"I love this place in the winter time - If you are in the mood for something on the hearty side, their stroganoff and chicken paprika are to die for (go for the potatoes instead of the dumplings when given the choice, although they are pretty nice in letting you have half of each).  Their perogies are quite tasty as well, but a little on the greasy side.  In the summer, go with one of their sandwiches and sit at the store front.  A nice beer and some people watching in Queen West is a great way to spend the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Bumbling around Queen W and have a hankering for some comfort food. Pierogies? Heck yes that hits the spot! How could it not? Potatoes, cheese, sour cream? Those are the three basic comfort food groups. Throw in bacon and you are 5 star bound.  Had a lovely pierogi lunch to go from here, and enjoyed the Eastern European deli feel as I waited. The person I was with got a sausage sandwich that looked equally good,  but once we got to the park we were both so fixated on our food that we didn't even have a chance to try each others. Enter food coma and slow waddle home.   MUST MENTION: Inside had a lovely feel, if it weren't so nice out I would have gladly stayed and had that sweet lady dote on me. Total Grandma envy.   KUDOS: For being generous with the sour cream.   WILL RETURN FOR: Some random Czech groceries I've never seen before."}
{"text":"Nice little deli/cafe with character. It's not just about the food here. It's about the experience, the feeling of escaping the city and perhaps even traveling to some Eastern European countries....  I have been there a couple of times on the weekends. It's always extremely busy so the service is a bit chancy... You might get a good host/hostess :) or you might not :s  This time I took my friend from Montreal to check this place out. She  absolutely loved this place. We ordered the Prague burger and grilled Moravian sausage. Boy, they were delicious and reasonably priced!!! To top it off, our hostess (a really nice young lady) suggested the palacinky (pancake) with ice cream and melted chocolate.... Yummmm !!!  Needless to say I love this place, maybe more on the weekdays to avoid lineups and rude hosts/hostesses..."}
