{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and love this neighborhood hole in the wall.  I come here for one reason, the bartenders (most) are amazing!  Think I'm done though...lastnight I witnessed a guy named Tony just completely berate one of the longtime bartenders, and in front of all the patrons!  When I found out this guy was the owner's son, I was shocked!  This is a people business, and no one deserves to be treated that way!"}
{"text":"Patron Beware!  Happy Hour is in the bar only.  Even though we asked the waiter about Happy Hour, he never mentioned prices were Bar Only.  $3.70 for a mini bottle of Coors! Really?  Gee, maybe that's why we showed up at 4:30pm. Same with Menu Side Choices----Salad included per the menu but extra cost upon ordering. Generous portions on the website---you're dreaming-----cole slaw side was less than a tablespoon full and 1/2 pound burger was no bigger than White Castle. Wait Staff as rude as it gets.  I'm not writing this just to be mean----this really happened and it was the worst American Food Bar Cafe I've ever experienced.  My friend/guest  with me was so shocked and couldn't believe it.  Just to confirm I ate here once before and it was so-so. Came back as it's close to my house and thought we would try happy hour and a burger. Great way to lose friends.  Many other places lower cost and much better food.  Complained to the owner and he was a bad as the wait staff.  I like what Eva M said----my friends made it good, otherwise crap.  I'll never go back even if it's free."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and enjoy a great price drinks and food anytime of day. Was my first time visiting definitely will go back!!"}
{"text":"Kinda really love this place. Here's why. Stiff cheap drinks, a REAL boozy day drinking crowd and pretty decent food. My Ketel One and tonic was so stiff I could barely taste the tonic. And it was $5.25! What?! Am I still in Scottsdale? Plus, I love the crowd. None of this fake \"frat boy\" fake dive bar crowd. No, middle aged serious boozers who really know how to drink. Fun, crazy, insane \"conversation\" with seriously drunk guy at 2 in the afternoon. Now that's entertainment! Also...the place has damn fine vitals. The only thing that would make this place a \"real\" dive bar is if the food was terrible. But, hey. Two out of three ain't bad. Glad this joint is with biking distance from my pad. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I hate this place.  The bar staff is very nice and more attentive than I would expect from a sorta busy dump/dive, but everything else here is for the birds.  The regular clientele seems seedy, with way too many people doing drugs in the bathrooms.  The food is sickening and served on dirty plates. Kinda hard to F up a burger and they do it with ease.  Just flat out the dirtiest bar and dining establishment I have ever found myself in."}
{"text":"First of all, allow me to preface this by saying that I have been in the service industry for (sadly) over 10 years. So compared to most people I am EXTREMELY forgiving to restaurants, bars and their staff. I'd also like to add that my AWFUL experience at 92nd Street Cafe is the reason I signed up with Yelp and write this review.  My sister and I sat at the bar of 92nd Street Cafe on a Wednesday night and the place was dead. The only other people in the establishment were a family of 4 eating dinner at a table at 3 frat boys at the bar. Our bartender, MICHELLE, completely ignored us the whole time...instead, flirted with the frat boys next to us. I ordered a Colorado Bulldog, a drink every bartender should know how to make...when It came back with no cream, I politely asked for them to add it. It was thrown back at me as if I was the biggest nuisance for asking.   The food...I wish I took a picture of it, it was such a joke. I ordered the \"Warm Chopped Grilled Vegetable Salad.\" According the the menu it included grilled vegetables with diced peppers, zucchini, grilled corn, spinach and romaine lettuce.\" It came to me, all romaine lettuce with what tasted like canned corn on top. I don't know where all the other vegetables were. When my sister asked what came on the salad, MICHELLE responded with an attitude like she obviously didn't care \"I don't know, green peppers, lettuce, some other things...\" Then walked away not offering to correct it.  Even though we sat there with empty glasses for over 25 minutes, MICHELLE didn't check on us ONCE. Instead, flirted with the guys next to us. After almost 30 minutes, I asked \"Excuse me, are you our waitress?\" She gave me the look of death and asked \"What?\" I asked again \"Are you our waitress?\" She said in the snottiest, attitude \"I'm your BARTENDER.\" It was at that point we asked for our check and left.  When an establishment makes you walk away asking yourself \"What did I say or do to that waitress/bartender/whoever to piss them off and make them treat us so poorly\" you know it's a BAD place that you should never go back to. I may have even gone back despite the crappy food. But our joke of a service from MICHELLE and her ugly attitude is repellent to anyone. I hope Yelp readers wont have to find out for themselves."}
{"text":"Me and my friend started coming here about 3 years ago now; initially everything was good. Service was good, the bartenders who worked on nights we'd stopped by at the time were great - sweet, attentive and always checked up on us, making sure we were having a good time and if we were sitting out in the patio somebody would always walk out back to see if we needed anything else. Drinks and appetizers I'd tried were good..  Fast forward to last year however, I'm not sure the owner has any idea what goes on whenever he's not around. Exactly a year ago this month, I came across the most disrespectful bartender I'd ever had to even talk to. That night there were two, tall blonde bartenders - one was called Tami, (with whom I'd had the pleasure of getting in an argument) .... unfortunately I didn't catch the other bartender's name but like mentioned, she was tall and blonde as well and wore glasses. We had just gotten off work that night and decided to go hang out at 92nd for a while and since we worked at a restaurant at the time, not everyone got off at the same time, meaning more came a little later than the rest of us. One of my then coworkers came in and sat right next to me, at this time I had noticed that Tami saw him sitting down, but decided to just walk by without acknowledging him. It wouldn't have been a big deal had she been busy tending to other guests, but no. She was not. I saw exactly what she did right after she'd walked by us- NOTHING. Just standing around, doing absolutely nothing. Given that I worked in a restaurant at the time as a host and server, I knew and understood what it was like having to multi task, making sure all guests are well taken care of. But she was out of line. Completely. After about 5 minutes of her just lurking around, I took it upon myself to call her out, asking why she hasn't asked my former co worker what he wanted to drink. She responded in a rude way, coming off as a complete cunt... Ushering in a bad, ugly, uncalled for situation. I asked why she was being so rude and pointed out that my friend had been sitting there and had gotten no service. She then told me I could get the hell out of \"her bar\" and proceeded to yank my glass of water that I was holding in one hand, causing it to spill everywhere. Rude. Just rude. I hope she's not there anymore.. If she is I hope she'd at least been reprimanded because I heard this isn't the first and only time she'd acted up. The food and drinks, I can't complain about.. I just wish they would do something about the bartenders having an attitude :( I'm giving this place 3 stars cus we always had a good time up until that night, and the food may not be the healthiest but they always came out on point and delicious."}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp to write this review for a few reasons. I want to let other people know that just because the \"hours today\" states that they are open until 2:30 am, don't expect them to live up to that. I've been here about three times at this point because it is close. The first time I went with a friend we were told they were going to be closing at 12:30 am and at my most recent visit, we were also kicked out at 1 am for closing. It seems that they close whenever they want to. They do not adhere to their shown times.  Also, the bartender Tommi is unprofessional. The first time I went, again, she was sitting out in the open at the bar on a mans lap and being physical with him... Yep. With the last visit she treated us very rudely and seemed annoyed when we asked for our drinks.   If you want at least kind/decent service in a maturely ran establishment...this isn't your place."}
{"text":"I love this place. It had good stiff cheap drinks. It has great food and its not just \"bar food\". And all the servers & bartenders are awesome. So whether it be for karaoke, Sunday football, or to eat this place doesn't disappoint. And its not a snobby scottsdale bar either. Love \"the ninety deuce\" as regulars would call it ;)"}
{"text":"Fun, corner bar with friendly staff and Karaoke Weds - Sat.  The locals are welcoming and fun to talk to and there is a pretty wide song selection.  DJs are easy to talk to, and you don't get that stuck up vibe that a lot of Karaoke bars put out."}
{"text":"Karoke night was fun to watch. Two bartenders, one guy and one girl. The girl was terrible. You had to flag her down to get a drink everytime. It became the talk of the bar. Good place to stop for one drink but not good enough to hang for the night."}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here reading all the reviews, I actually googled the 92nd street menu, and was surprised it has such a variety of menu options, I live next door and I can tell you the place is Packed! Most days of the week! They obviously must be doing something right:) I am going to stop in Saturday for the Packer/Cardinal game, I am so excited to visit!!                #GO PACKERS#LOVEMYTEAM#"}
{"text":"sweet and short. This place is fun fo go to. Seems like the guests are friendly and regulars. Food is good, and of course you can't dislike the bug tvs if the big game is on."}
{"text":"Heard food was good but walked in and never got to try it.  Air conditioner was not working so we decided to go to mellow mushroom.  Definitely a good decision.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Gross.  I just moved to the neighborhood, but knew of this place for 20 years.  I just thought I'd get some takeout and give it a shot since my family was out of town.  I mean seriously. I'm not particular.  But I just threw out my entire entree after one bite.  It's disgusting.  I also got wings which were less than spectacular, but passable as wings.  But dear lord, I got a sampler to see what they had cooking. ribs, shrimp and chicken. all of it: d-i-s-g-u-s-t-i-n-g."}
{"text":"Amazing bar!! The bartender, Carmit, is freaking amazing!! ..BEST bartender ever! ..karaoke is always a blast! Actually great singers and the hosts are a blast. Definitely recommend this bar to anyone and everyone !!"}
{"text":"Service was lacking a lot and it wasn't busy.....on a Friday.  I make better burgers than they do, which is saying a lot. Save your money.  Go to Red Robin or Mimi's Cafe instead."}
{"text":"Great bar with great food and staff.  They also have karaoke at 9pm until 1:30am Wednesday through Saturday.  The karaoke hosts are awesome and always fun!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. My guy had the all you can eat fish fry which he enjoyed along with the homemade clam chowder. I had the steak sandwich which was okay, nothing special. Even though the restaurant wasn't  that busy, the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night! Great staff and good drinks. Tommi the bartender was awesome!  Karaoke was entertaining, I can't sing. .. but neither could most... lots of good laughs!"}
{"text":"This bar has every aspect of a dive bar that you love. Karaoke Wednesday through Sunday, the best staff ever, strong drinks, great food. For those looking for a bar family this is the place to go. Anyone who says otherwise is usually some drunk asshole who got kicked out. Join us, love us."}
{"text":"We found a new local sports bar and cafe! Good food, great people and you leave feeling satisfied without digging too deep in the wallet. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! So much fun for karaoke, a great down-to-earth crowd that will sing along with you and a great selection of food that's better than your average bar/pub.  I highly recommend it for a low-key night out, kicking back with friends or singing along with strangers! :)"}
{"text":"We tried the 92nd Street Cafe tonight because being from out of town we didn't want to go to a chain restaurant for a meal we could have had at home, but after the experience tonight I concede we should have gone to any national chain restaurant instead. Both my husband's meal and mine were basically inedible, but the staff appeared to be unconcerned because at no point were we asked how the meal was or why we ate only a small portion of it before pushing it aside. Our server never took an interest in our table, a second round of drinks took forever to materialize, despite the restaurant being far from full of patrons. I am happy to say this will be an adventure in dining I will never again repeat nor would I recommend anyone else wasting their hard earned cash here."}
{"text":"Really bad burger; dry and tasteless. My wife had the 92 st burger; I had the mushroom with Swiss cheese. We asked the waitress how they do a medium; she said pink inside. What we both got was overcooked (not a hint of pink) and had no flavor. Fries were bland as well.   We left half the burger and most of the fries uneaten. Waitress said she'd talk to the owner about some sort of compensation on the bill but told us he said 'no'.  No return visit for us."}
{"text":"Great local joint......with high traffic but really, really noisy.  Staff is pleasant but the evening we were there were in short supply.  Really felt bad for them....food was okay."}
{"text":"Here for the Packers v Bears football game. Happy Hour for drinks goes till 7 pm. Food till 6 pm. Had the chicken strips w fries, $5. Loads of TV's. Attentive waitstaff"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great staff!!!! Everyone is super nice and attentive.  The food is good and the drinks even better."}
{"text":"Come here fairly often with my fiance and like the atmosphere. Dawnielle does fantastic karaoke on weeknights and is always friendly! Food is decent and drinks are strong :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual, low-key, taverny kind of place this would be it. Food is better than bar food and the servings are big enough to share. Been here a couple of times with friends from Chicago and they know the bartender and manager very well from years of making this one of \"their\" places.  The crowd is a mix, but more often older patrons. The service is spotty, but if the one you get knows you from coming in, the service is much better. Worth going and making it your neighborhood place."}
{"text":"5 stars just because the \"fit\" bartender that everyone else has mentioned is hot, my type for sure!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very unhappy when we did not order drinks before we even sat down at the table. stormed off and called me a snot. sent a busboy over to take our order   we did order but cancelled when she told me the manager said I was also a snot and didn't care about the situation  Your food is not that good and your service is really bad.  Worse than bad  horrible."}
{"text":"It was packed Friday night, but we found ourselves an outside table on the patio.  Takes a little longer than expected to get service outside but it was worth the wait.  We ordered beers which were very reasonably priced and drank while we waited for the food. Ordered the salmon with baked potatoes and veggies which came with a salad.  Also had the all you can eat fish fry with soup and a baked potato.  The baked potatoes were not steaming when they were opened so I guess the were pre-baked and then reheated.  Ergo they were a bit tough inside--you know, as opposed to hot and fluffy.  The salad was a simple one with red cabbage, iceberg lettuce, croutons and cheese.  It was fine considering that it was included with our meal.  You expect more when you pay for a salad.  The soup of the day was New England clam chowder which was very mediocre (not tasty).  I added salt, pepper, Cholula hot sauce and it was still not worth the calories.  There was something lacking--- hmmm.... taste.   The salmon was a nice portion and well prepared.  The star of the night was the fried codfish.  OMG.  Whoever breaded the codfish was an expert---Very, very light crust.  The ratio of crust to fish was perfection.  The cod was thick and moist--made you want to eat more and more, hence all you can eat.   Service by Linda was fine considering she was running like a chicken without a head amongst the outside tables and the place was very busy tonight.   I would go again for that all you can eat fish fry.  I am telling you that I don't know of another place that makes fish any better than this."}
{"text":"If you're trying to call in your order took out all never happen the bartenders too busy to take your calls.    Sue and Kelly are awesome however   There seems to be a bit of entitlement to answer the phone."}
{"text":"Sunday football @ 92. Got the games we wanted, so big points scored there. Then one channel switched w/o consultation; cost them a star. The homestyle fried chicken was the best I've had in years! Every piece perfectly crisp and juicy without being greasy. YUM! Steak & Eggs and fries were great. Drinks were strong including Martini specials. They give great karaoke @ night."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a big game night;Cardinals vs Green Bay. They were slammed, but we still managed to get an ice cold pitcher of beer and a delicious plate of Nachos Grande. Service was  understandably slow to start. Still, everything worked out and we had a good time. There was a friendly helpful fellow who might have been the manager who was following up and giving support to the wait staff. We are looking forward to trying their fish fry on Friday."}
{"text":"We went to Karaoke on a wed.nt..Nice little place.Theres no stage,you just sing where ever..."}
{"text":"I went here with my family a couple of days ago. I like the restaurant format but I don't really like the food on the menu. Our waiter was alright and I would give him a B-. The food was pretty good but not great."}
{"text":"This place is the best local watering hole I've ever experienced and unfortunately I know what I'm talking about, lol. 9-Deuce forever!!! Kelly ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Tommy and Sue are absolutely amazing!! They run the bar in the sweetest & most attentive way as possible. True bosses. #bossladies #favoritestaff"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for lunch many times over the past three years, and I think the food is very good for the price, and the service is always excellent.  The waitresses are always attentive, and the food is always prepared the way I like it.  The atmosphere is not upscale, but hey, it's a neighborhood bar -- what do you expect!  Besides, you can't \"eat\" the surroundings.  I recommend this Cafe to anyone wanting a plentiful, well cooked meal."}
{"text":"Worst fish tacos ever, couldn't even finish them, closaw was old and disgusting, and pasta was plain and gross. Not gonna order uber eats from you guys again."}
{"text":"I had to change my review. After going there repeatedly, I came to realize this is an overpriced dive bar that over serves people constantly. Even for Scottsdale, the prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"92nd St Cafe is a local sports bar & grill in North Scottsdale. As a sports bar, I could easily give it 4 stars - great atmosphere, sports on many TV's, and the fans seemed to be having fun; definitely seems like a place that locals have been going to for a long time. However, we went there to dine, and as a restaurant we had a 2 star experience, at best. First off, the place is nice - much nicer than your average sports bar. It has a nice Scottsdale classy feel, without being snobby - more traditional pub atmosphere than anything else. It's a nice place, and has a fun adult vibe. Nobody greeted us when we walked in and we sat ourselves at a booth and had to wait a while for anyone to acknowledge us - we went on a Sunday afternoon, and though the place was busy, it was certainly not full. Most people were just ordering beer and watching football, we seemed to be the only actual \"diners\" there, and received kinda lackluster service for having paid over $50 for a lunch for two (with a coupon also!). our food items: I got the crock of french onion soup. At first it was pretty good - nice melted cheese over a good smelling broth. but once I got into the soup itself, it was a DISASTER. Whoever cut the onions was completely incompetent. there were giant pieces of onion in the soup, so large they were inedible and it was rather gross. I had to pull them out and place them off to the side, it looked disgusting. For the cook to mess up the onions in an onion soup is rather unforgivable. French Onion Soup gets 1 star. The next two items: well when they were served, there were nothing like the description on the menu. I got something called a Bar Steak - don't ever order it. It was cubed beef stew in an awful and diluted wine/garlic \"sauce\". The menu did NOT describe it also smothered in mushrooms - I cannot eat mushrooms and was pretty annoyed that mushrooms were the main ingredient of the dish, despite not being mentioned on the menu. After having to removed the mushrooms (which joined the pile of giant slices of onions), I proceeded to try what was really chewy and flavorless cubes of beef. This appetizer is a complete fail - not only was it nothing like the menu description, it was rather disgusting and unappetizing. For $12 I recommend that you NEVER order it. Again, a 1 star rating for the Bar Steak. My main entree was the Hawaiian Princess salad for $10+.  Again, NOTHING like the description on the menu. I received a plate that had two ice-cream-sized scoops of tuna and chicken salad, surround by really large pieces of melon and pineapple and a few oranges. There were no greens to mix the salad with. The menu described a dressing, that I did not receive - when I asked for it, the waitress said there was no dressing for that salad; when I mentioned that the menu indicates a dressing, she shrugged and said it was wrong. I was extremely disappointed that my salad was essentially a melon fruit plate. The tuna and chicken salad were completely bland, I couldn't taste any seasoning in them. This was a terrible entree choice on my part. And again, like the onion soup and beef stew app, this salad \"entree\" is a 1 star item.  My wife ordered the bowl of chili. Out of everything we ordered, that was the best. It was not great by any means, but it wasn't too bad either. Tasted rather generic, like it came out of a can. I guess we were so disappointed with the other items, we ate the entire bowl of chili out of desperation to have something edible and decent. She also got the tuna melt and was not impressed. The tuna again was bland and unseasoned. The rest of the sandwich was very forgettable For $10, it gets 1 star also.  Maybe we just happened to order the worst items on the menu, but for the money we spent, that was a terrible Sunday lunch. The service was not memorable or helpful, the food was either bland or just plain bad, and it was horrible value for the money. The silver lining? probably a great place to have a few beers and watch a game, however I would not recommend it as a local dining option, unless you get drunk first at the bar and don't really care what is served in front of you...."}
{"text":"Sorry, can't give this place more than 1 after a bad experience. Used to be sweet dive bar, now it's just a local loadie bar. Bartenders don't care, no management, and the karaoke guy is a real piece of work. He assaulted a guy while we were there and acted like he owned the place. Way to treat customers. Never will go again. Unless I am looking for some fisticuffs, then I will go for sure!"}
{"text":"Been going here off and on for a few months. Always during happy hour. (prices are the best) Always friendly staff, very good service. Food is very good. (we just order the appetizers) Nice selection. Hoping to try the Friday fish fry, I have heard very good things about that."}
{"text":"Sunday night, busy weekend, lazy...we decided to pop down the block from our new place....French Dip, a Burger, few pops, some football and excellent service! Just found my new closest to the house watering hole!"}
{"text":"The fish was good slaw was good. CAREFUL as they round up on your bills."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! I always go during football season originally being from WI to watch the packer games ! There are bears fans there as well and they are all good sports so it's fun to joke around about the rivalry. Food is great, they even have a Friday fish fry which if your from the Midwest you will enjoy. The drinks are a great price as well. The owner Mike is a really nice guy and I have got to meet him! I will continue to go back especially during football season !"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this place.   It's a little quirky and the service is hit or miss.   I don't really know what it is.   But I just enjoy coming.   Maybe cuz it's close to the house or cuz they serve alcohol.  Well the food is really cheap, and the portions are decent for the price.   It  doesn't really seem like a cafe when you think cafe in your head.   It's more like a bar with cheap food.   But decent enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I would like this place a lot more if the karaoke were better.  The selection of songs is really odd. Plus I gave the dude a $10 tip and he let me do one song in three hours. Not cool, dude."}
{"text":"The food is inedible. I ordered the chicken parm sliders and a monte cristo for myself and a coworker. The monte cristo was soggy and so full of dripping grease that you couldn't taste anything but oil. The slider buns were stale and the chicken was an overcooked hockey puck. Just foul, it all went in the trash."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I went last night with a group of people for karaoke night. We found a place to sit up on the higher level area.   Let me begin with service, our server was pompous and rude. I was the DD so I just got water but He was scolding my friends about their Arizona driver licenses and how they have to switch it to the new one. I told him that was not true, it only applies if you have a vertical driver license, they both have horizontal. He continued to argue and say that's not correct and he would \"let it slide this once.\" I looked it up and I'm correct. It applies to vertical license and old AZ driver licenses are okay until October 1, 2020 for travel at airports. He should get his facts straight.   He also made a rude comment to us, he asked us if we were still \"sitting pretty\" and my friend answered \"yes.\"  He then said, \"Just like a quadriplegic beauty queen.\" I didn't think that was funny at all and it was offensive.  He also took about 20 mins to pick up our check from our table and we were dying to leave at this point.   We were excited for Karaoke and my friend put our names in, she asked them where to put our paper and they said on the lap top. She said it wasn't a large pile and I'm sure we would be singing in like 15-20 mins. WRONG. We waited an hour and a half.. We never got up there. What pisses me off the most was the girl server that works there sang TWICE and our personal server got to sing too. Yet we still had not been called up there? You should let your patrons have an opportunity to sing first before you staff. Even the couple in front of us seemed upset too because they were waiting to sing too. I think their should be an actual sign up sheet. Not scraps of paper so whoever is working the karaoke machine can't pick and choose who is next.   I don't think I'll be back here, the service and the lack of organization of karaoke killed it for me."}
{"text":"Your reviews speak for themselves Michael, I paid my dues.  Also giving alcohol to a person taking a blood thinner could cause a stroke ,I told that to your  worthless bartender(Jeanne is her name, blonde or brunette) _____________________ch They kept on serving this old man, he had bandages all over his arms from bruising and blood clots  Also the 'decor' is 70's, very low for N Scottsdale and food was atrocious 15 years the last time I tried it, might end up at Scottsdale/Shea hospital if you eat it.   Hello Mc Fly....money?? pathetic  How come you did not file charges then? afraid of being caught?  Negligent Homicide will shut your joint down and you in Prison and your bartender Save your money people and stay clear of this 4th World  chithole.  bye bye"}
{"text":"-10 stars. They sit there and let their racist karaoke leader mock customers and get into altercations and shove women who are patrons of the bar. He has assaulted our our family by physically shoving  the hat of my brother deeper onto his head instigating a fight between a big group of people. This bar only supports their \" regulars\" and do not make new customers feel welcomed."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I came in with my dad to watch a March Madness game. First, they told us it was impossible to change a TV? (No one else was watching it) The bartender was absolutely rude. Got super annoyed at my dad for asking for a glass for his beer. She gave me the wrong drink twice and got mad at ME for it. Eye rolls, shit talking, bad attitude. Honestly the worst establishment I've ever been at in a long time. The best part is they confronted me about my review. The nicer bartender was fine, but the rude one- watch out."}
{"text":"This place was alright. The Reuben sandwich was pretty good, a little skimpy on the corned beef, but still good. We got there shortly after they opened so our service was fast. Our waitress Lori was efficient and pleasant. I wanted to sit outside, but the old timers were out there smoking, and I don't care for cigarette smoke. After a while the smoke started coming in through the door. Aside from them it was okay. Nothing to write home about, feels like a sports bar. if cigarette smoke bothers you I suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  Kelly's my fav bartender. The food is fresh bar comfort food.  And happy hour is all day."}
{"text":"we just paid $7 for a cut up chicken fillet. yes, only $7 but it was just shocking.  you ordered chicken fingers thinking you'd maybe get fries??? service was... bad... drinks were subpar. checked it off the list but we won't be back"}
{"text":"My Tuna Melt was excellent as was the accompanying coleslaw.  The New England Clam chowder left much to be desired."}
{"text":"EDIT:  Since my original review 92nd St Cafe has been almost completely remodeled with new furniture & new bathrooms, and the clutter of ads, posters, signs, & pennants has been significantly reduced. I have not seen the latest menu but I assume it's had changes as well. The staff is still friendly and it's still a fun and cozy neighborhood bar. The only negative is the lack of new karaoke tracks but that's dependant upon the karaoke host.   ORIGINAL REVIEW:  What to say about 92nd St Cafe? Well, it's kind of crappy but at the same time it's kind of not. I mean, the furniture is nice and they're remodeling the bathrooms. But the layout is so bizarre and there's so many beer ads, posters, neon signs, & pennants that it makes all the nice stuff irrelevant. The shape of the bar is weird too and there's not much room to move around when it's busy. The karaoke has a new guy that's cool, right now it's my favorite place to Karaoke. The staff is friendly and they remember customers. After only two visits the waiter remembered my favorite drink. The food is pretty good quality but their menu is a crazy clusterf*ck of different kinds of food. Nachos, fried shrimp, linguine bolognese, omelettes?  All in all this place is a cozy neighborhood bar that's fun to have a few drinks at."}
{"text":"Nice local sports bar to go to. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable she made you feel very comfortable, food was outstanding drinks were great we will definitely be regulars. Thank you"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to 92nd Street Cafe for dinner last night on 5/12/16 at about 7 pm.  We entered through the bar door and went into eating area where a table of 3 men were simply drinking.  All the other tables were empty besides people at the bar.  We asked a young man at the other door if we should be seated or sit anywhere.  He seemed bored and said to sit anywhere.  We did and a few minutes later he asked if we wanted drinks.  The table was absolutely filthy and asked that they please clean it before drinks came.  A young boy came to wipe the table and left it all soaking wet. (not sure the rag was even clean).  I asked the first guy to please have someone dry it off before our water or menus came.  Finally the young boy came apologetically.    I ordered a burger with fries and a coke.  My daughter ordered a tuna melt and hard apple cider.  The \"waiter?\" asked for her ID.  He proceeded to tell her to update it as many places would not accept hers and showed his license to her.  Regardless, we then waited too long for a coke and her bottle of cider.  Remember there was no other table with patrons in the dining room.  It was at least 25 minutes before the food came after he stopped by twice to say he would check on the food.  Once it finally came we asked for ketchup which should have arrived before the food.  He didn't seem at all concerned about his lack of service.  French Fries were not cooked thru at all!!!  He took the fries back to put back in fryer (he said). The hamburger was overcooked, the bun looked small and old, and my daughter's tuna melt stunk like old fish.  We could not and would not eat this disgusting food!   We told him we could not eat this.  He never asked if we wanted a replacement or even seemed truly upset with the bad service given.  We did, however, get an $8 bill for our drinks.    I am very disappointed with 92nd Street Cafe!! I have been there many times through the years as I've lived in the neighborhood for 24 years.    I will not be returning!  BTW..went to McDonalds after we left and got a better burger.  Sad!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. I had the mushroom burger with a veggie patty substituted. It was on par with most other veggie patties at restaurants, dry with little taste. The veggies on it were really good. I can't fault 92nd for what the trend is amongst most restaurants. My friend's burger, she said, was overcooked and burned. She asked for medium well. She has a tendency to not say anything at restaurants, so if the employees are reading this, no worries. You could not have known. I might be back for the karaoke and pool table, since there was a cool vibe. I won't be back for the food. The service was great! They were attentive, sweet, and seemed to really care about how we were doing. Again, I am sure this place has a cool bar/ local hang-out feel later at night."}
{"text":"Perfect place for white trash and alcoholics! If you're looking for a sewer and filth in food, drinks and smoke, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local restaurant and bar.  We stopped in for supper and enjoyed the Guac Burger with fruit.   Service was fantastic and food was wonderful.  Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"No stars actually.  Ordered a burger. Waited half hour.  Server brought a cheeseburger and had to send it back.  9:45 p.m.  Few people eating. Most in the bar.  Waited another 15 minutes and gave up.  9 years eating here.  Never saw such lackluster service.  They couldn't care less about me or my business.  Goodbye 92nd St."}
{"text":"I usually do not rate places when I travel. But this place deserves a bad rating. Was in town for business.  Food- not good.  Service- eating dinner instead of serving me.  Pretty bad overall."}
{"text":"I've lived about 2 minutes away from this place for the last 5 years and never tried it.  I found a coupon of buy one, get one free so we thought we would try it before the kids' baseball game last night.    Now I know why I never bothered.  It is a dive bar for sure and it's definitely a good place to go if you don't like the trendy places.  I would probably go back just for drinks and maybe an appetizer.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a server.  As I set my coupon on the table (not sure if he needed to see it right away), I ordered my drink and showed him the coupon.  HIs response was a smart- assed \"yeah, I can see it\".  Strike one.  I work in a restaurant and I will hold you to a standard.  My son ordered the kids sliders with only cheese and ketchup, the other kid ordered kids' strips, I ordered the meatloaf and my husband ordered the bolognese dish and asked for a salad.  We asked for an appetizer of wings.  There was a style of ordering them that I questioned and the server's response was another smart ass reply that they are exactly how they sound.  Okay, well every place is different and I wanted to know WTF made this place so freaking special with their stupid wings.  Strike two.  Then at this point there was a server change, the next guy was really nice.  My son's sliders came out about 15 minutes before anything else.  And they had onions on them, not how he ordered it.  Strike three.  Honestly, I should have just walked out at this point.  My husband never got his salad and the wings were okay.  I would have had better wings elsewhere.  Strike four.  We had to be at the kids' field for baseball at 6:15 and it was already 5:50 before we got anything.  My meatloaf was supposed to come with mashed potatoes and they gave me some nasty rice.  I asked for the potatoes.  He came back 10 minutes later to say they were working on the potatoes and I told him that we had to leave and I needed a box.  My husband just left with the kids.  My meatloaf was okay, it had good flavor but the consistency of dog food.  Now I wish I had a dog so I could just give the leftovers to him.    The server apologized for everything and stated that he walked in and everything was thrown on him, which I could believe because the other guy was such an ass.  When he took the value for our coupon off, they took off the cheapest meal which was my son's $6 chicken fingers!  The coupon had a value up to $8 or $10.  So why choose the cheapest one when tax added another $5 and I had a savings then of $1.  Strike 5,042.  We paid $55 for shitty food and drinks.    I also want to add that the guy who brought our food was also really nice.  So, this place gets a star for their servers, otherwise, if I could score a negative 10, I would.  I texted one of my friends right away and told her to pass on it."}
{"text":"Judy B been coming here for 12 years and the 92nd st burger clearly says comes with swiss and cheddar cheese. Sounds like 92nd is better without people that can't read.   I have never had bad food there and yes SOMETIMES a bar is very busy and food and drinks take longer. Takes even longer when they have to remake food that was brought out right but a customer fails to read the menu"}
{"text":"This actually maybe the worst service in Scottsdale, Az.  I waited forever to get a beer and th he folks that came in after me never got served an left. Save your time and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This area has plenty of housing but not many options to choose from for evening cocktails. Luckily a spot like 92nd Street Cafe exists. Now, here's something very important to note: disregard the name \"cafe\" in the title. When I think of a cafe, I think of a quaint spot where I can get a nice coffee, a simple sandwich/salad and sit for hours while reading a book. But at 92nd Street Cafe, think about this spot more as one where you go to after a couple or to get a couple drinks and waist the day/night away with bar food and dive drinks.   The scene here is pretty classic and fun. I walked in and saw a large group of bar goers themed in their best 80s attire. I saw old men who were stumbling around like they'd been drinking since 1989 and I saw normal bar goers just there to kick back and have a few.   It's divey in here but clean, the staff is friendly and the drinks are good. It's a narrow bar but surprisingly has a decent amount of seating a room. The interior has plenty of activities for the drinkers as well.   I will end this review with a funny observation I made while there and that's the fact that this bar is right next to Sweet Republic. One day the kids are getting ice cream with their folks, the next day they are home from college and discover 92nd Street Cafe next door."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bar. I just moved from Chicago and I'm used to really old bars with that Irish pub smell, good bar food and loud people. This is exactly that. This is my new go to when I need a place to have a good night with good people. Plus they play cubs and hawks games, I'm sold."}
{"text":"OH MY MY where do I start???? I'll start with the bartender TOMMI called me a \"Cunt\" and a \"Stupid fuckin bitch\" in front of a bar full of people, then kicked me out!! All because she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MOSCOW MULE.  Yup that happened.  It was 10pm when myself & 2 other people came there and ordered a Moscow Mule, she attempted to make them but served us vodka soda w/ a lime. There was NO GINGER BEER in it. Clearly a Moscow Mule is GINGER BEER, vodka & lime juice. No mint! No soda water! So we returned the drinks (FULL) and said \"AGAIN there is NO GINGER BEER in these\" (we were there last Thurs & she tried to do the same thing to all of us, then charge me Moscow Mule prices, I said no I'm paying vodka/soda prices) I called a cab and we went outside to wait. The next thing I know TOMMI comes outside and starts yelling at me because, we were talking about how she doesn't know how to make the drink. She calls me a \"cunt, a stupid fucking bitch, tells me the ginger beer gun must be out\" and kicks me out. CLEARLY GINGER BEER NEVER COMES OUT OF A GUN. Ginger Ale does. On a side not I placed a phone call to 92nd St prior to going there last night because of what happened last Thurs night, asking if they had ginger beer now, I was told yes! So we went there only to get Moscow Mules. To our total disappointment and HORRIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL service we left.  We went to Chop & Wok and had many great tasting, well made Moscow Mules!!!!  I would NEVER EVER recommend this place! As to TOMMI, you need to really think about the words that come out of your mouth at the place of business you work at. #Classy Oh the unprofessionalism doesn't stop there, come to find out after we left a few of my friends went there (she knew we were friends) and she continued to talk shit about me and brag about kicking me out!!!! WOW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood pub/bar/restaurant.  The food isn't fancy, but it is good.  It is a regular hangout for quite a number of patrons, but even if you go there infrequently, if you get the same bartender a few times, they will remember your name.  I've sat at the bar, at one of the tables in the bar section, and in the restaurant area.  Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"1 star is being kind. I had my food delivered so my review is completely based on the food. I ordered the chicken piccata. It was absolutely disgusting. Chicken piccata is supposed to have a butter and lemon sauce and this definitely did not have that taste, it tasted more like chicken marsala. My husband had the linguine and meatballs which he took one bite of and threw it away. The meatballs had an overwhelming taste of parmesan, the whole dish was inedible. My son had the sliders and fries. Sliders were just a burnt, tough piece of meat with no other flavor in between a bun. They didn't even have a piece of cheese. The buns were hard. The fries were soggy and bland. All this food ended up in the trash cause it was so inedible, what a huge disappointment. We spent $38 on this food. Definitely not worth it. I would not recommend the food here to anyone. Trust me, you will regret it."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to come for a drink. But if you're interested in getting anything off the menu, please spare yourself the disappointment.  Food- zero stars. (It's hard to burn something and make it slimy at the same time) Service- zero stars (My waiter just let a drop of sweat on my leg) Atmosphere- one star (your neighborhood hole in the wall) oh and they forgot to bring my side of bacon ."}
{"text":"We went to this place for a friend's graduation party around 11pm. I agree with the other posters that this is a very odd shaped bar! It felt very segregated and did not really allow for cross party interaction as the place is basically split into two. The karaoke was fun and the guy running it was a cool older guy. He did a couple songs too! Didn't try any of the food this time around but kind of want to go back to redeem myself from a bad karaoke attempt lol. It did take a while to get a drink. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas. There were two girls working the bar and it still took quite a while to have my order taken. I didn't want to get up in their faces so I was waiting towards the end of the bar and eventually had to have a seat it was taking so long."}
{"text":"I have had food delivered twice from 92nd Street Café. The first time was worthy of at least 3 stars...unfortunately, today was a 1 star day. My bbq bacon burger arrived disheveled and unappetizingly burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. I ordered it as well-done and asked to have the bbq sauce on the side. Neither of those things happened. After taking a bite, I promptly tossed it in the garbage. So bummed out and nauseous (there's nothing quite like biting into a raw meat patty). My coworker ordered zucchini and it arrived soggy and inedible."}
{"text":"This place is okay. We had the steak sandwich, gyro, shrimp cocktail and cheesecake. Steak sandwich was tough (cooked medium) and on bread that got super soggy. They need to use harder rolls not soft sandwich rolls. Gyro was okay, pita a little tough, and cucumber sauce was oddly a little sweet. Shrimp cocktail was good, just overpriced for 5 shrimp. Cheesecake was tasty. All in all a decent place to eat, just not mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Eating amazing desert while getting served by the best looking server in town Tony aka \"Johnny Neuron\". Life is grand."}
{"text":"Overall my experience was great, but not because of the waitresses and drinks we had but because I had fun with the people I was with.  We went there on a wednesday night, so we knew it would be dead. The music was rap/hip-hop all night (not too loud though, we could here each others fine). There is about 5 TV screens surrounding the bar, all with different channels on (news, sports...). The waitress was pleasant. I had bought a yelp deal $10 for $20. The waitress first took off $10 of the bill and I had to explain to her that I had already paid $10 to yelp and she should take off $20 (like it says on the voucher). It took her a while to get it.  Like I said, of you are with good friends, just looking for a place to grab a drink, and you already in the area, then you'll be fine. After all it's the people you are with that will make your night!"}
{"text":"The service was awful but the food was really good. Next time we'll sit at the bar to be sure to have attention from our server... Just awful."}
{"text":"Scottsdale G - I happen to be at this bar today and it was very fun and the music was great !!! I suggest you don't come back until next July.. if you want quiet and a peaceful experience go to the mustang library across the street!    This is a great neighbor bar .. w great people"}
{"text":"FIRST THINGS FIRST, 1 star is too kind. Second, WATCH YOUR TAB. The bartenders have a tendency to add drinks that you didn't purchase and keep the cash you paid and still charge your card. Yup that's right. Some of them were cool though, so I can't hate on them all. The locals also hate on you and talk mad shit behind your back if you're not from Scottsdale. Seriously? High School is over folks, move along... Please, for the love of a REAL Jack & Coke, stop adding shit whiskey to your Jack Daniels. Legit I think I've had 2 ACTUAL JACK & COKE's... I've ordered at least 20(yes at least) in my few visits. Maybe, MAYBE 2 of them were actually Jack. With all that being said if you still decide to go, good luck and be safe. I won't see you there."}
{"text":"First time here. The sever is extremely unprofessional and didn't greet us. We sat in the upper area and ordered 2 burgers. I had the BBQ and she had the guacamole one.  The burgers were extremely tasteless and it was over cooked. The French fries seemed to be the frozen ones that I can make at home. The server never refilled and I had to walk up to the bar to finally get one. Sadly my stomach actually hurts after eating. The 20 for 10 is nice, but they need that to even get customers I bet. I would not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Food is great. I don't understand why it has so many bad reviews ? The appeal of the restaurant in the inside is a little drab and outdated, but besides that great food. I'd rather the food be amazing then a fancy looking place and shitty food"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Friendly and efficient service....even going the extra mile. Great food and fun atmosphere. Can't believe 92nd Street Cafe has been around so long yet this is our first visit! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar, great bartenders cold beer and good people. I came with my girl who is a regular here. When I say regular? She's a regular. The moment we came in a bartender handed her an old pasta bill she hadn't paid. Yeah... haha. Yes, she paid it. Haha... Anyway, great environment. Neighborhood bar. The people are nice and welcoming. They sell food too, from what I hear it is delicious food. I'll try the food when I come back."}
{"text":"Still love the 92nd street cafe but was very disappointed when I went in last Friday, expecting to see Carmit behind the bar and she wasn't there, but instead waiting tables. Why take the bartender who makes the most technical and complex drinks so very expertly and sideline her?? No offense to her replacement, she's extremely polite but she's not adept at making drinks!!   Hoping to see Carmit either reinstated or possibly picking up Sunday's, that'll give me a reason to go on Sunday!   Also finally met Tomi, if you're ever in on a Tuesday or Saturday, she is so amazing and funny, the perfect complement to Sue, who as I said before, is complete perfection!!  Come on 92nd, don't let us regulars down, #bringbackCarmit"}
{"text":"The worst service ever on St. Pattys day by Julie the bar tender whom preferred to stare at herself in the mirror rather than pay attention to the patrons. Not to mention she only helped the \"guys\" who were either inflating her ego or tipping her! I waved my hand 5 times (10 feet from her) to close my tap and she ignored me and my girlfriend. She has no business in the bar service!  On a side note bar tender Karmeet bent over backwards to help out. She was excellent and saw everything.  Won't go or ever recommend this place if Julie is working there  So sad!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! We love this place and go here often because we love the bartenders and the atmosphere, but last Saturday when we were on a pub crawl and made this one of our stops we got to meet Tony the so called manager (son of the owner) that has no business managing anything. He is rude and kept trying to push us to order from him then he turned up the music so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk. We had to ask the bartenders who we love there to turn it down for us which they did of course and Tony turned it back up! BTW Tony 92 is not a club. We hope the owner gets wise and puts his son on dish duty or some other job he is actually qualified for."}
{"text":"I live near 92nd Street Cafe and have been curious to try their breakfast. Well, the experience I had left something to be desired. It was partially my fault as I they have three entrances and I (inadvertently) chose the bar entrance. My boyfriend and I say down at the nearest table and it took at least 10 minutes or so for a server to show up (granted, we appeared to be sitting in the bar area, but the bartender saw us and could have said something). In any case, we ordered and the food came out. My boyfriend's 92nd Street Cafe skillet was pretty good. But my dish was, for lack of a better word, terrible. I am not picky with food at all, but the crab was not real and very obviously so. The Hollandaise sauce was not fresh and the potatoes had no taste. I was disappointed because I don't go out often and when I do, I want it to be worth the (little) money that I have. Anyway, it took another 10 minutes upon finishing to get our check. We had to tell the bartender, though again, it could have been because we were sitting in the bar area. Overall, I definitely got the vibe that if you're not a regular, and not an alcoholic, you might find yourself a little out of place here. I sense they don't like uptight or picky types that can frequent Scottsdale restaurants, which is good. But I still got the vibe that it was elitist in its own way.  I'd probably have to try some other things on their menu to really write a good review, but for now I am not a big fan."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to for karaoke. Tonight was my bday. First song i sung,  \"dj\" (dweeb) made fun of me (and no im not a terrible singer if thats what you were thinking) his inability to work his own job is whats embarrassing. He was super plastered so when my sister said he was being rude he screamed at her to get the fuck out. I will never come back to this place. The whole vibe was off packed full of snotty dbags. This place used to have a community vibe with all ages and backrounds. Now its just bleached bottle 20 somethings. Wish Danielle was djing tonight. She knew how to treat her customers."}
{"text":"DRINKERS AND SINGERS BEWARE!!!!! Possibly the worst spot I've been to in Scottsdale. If I could give 0 stars i would!Between the watered down/cheap liquor, a bartender who pockets your cash then charges you double, and a the female karaoke host (the other guy was good) who only plays songs for her friends, I can safely say, STAY THE HELL AWAY!! Will be seeking other watering holes."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews? We decided to eat here because it was next to the Glow Putt golf place and we were hungry. We sat outside on the small patio area and enjoyed the beautiful evening. Our waiter was excellent; very professional, personable and service was quick. Our group order the strawberry salad, the Chinese salad and french onion soup with garlic bread. They all tasted GREAT! Salads were fresh and presented really nicely. Soups were delicious and so was the garlic bread. Prices were totally affordable and they had a pretty good sized menu, not just \"bar food\". We would definitely eat here again. The majority of the bad reviews seems to be from unhappy bar patrons, but as far as food quality, price, and service....no complaints here!"}
{"text":"It's a cool place good food and great drinks.  There is a shorthair and bearded guy  there thay should  run the bar  he knows what he is  doing. the other guy calls himself the boss should look for a new jib"}
{"text":"Favorite place in the neighborhood!!! Food is delish... bartenders become your best friends.. and the regulars welcome you right in!!! Come here for a fun happy hour or Sunday funday!!! Always a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Just terrible. The female answering the phone should be fired. Tried to place an order for pick up and she was so incredibly rude with a touch of 80's valley girl in her voice."}
{"text":"Not bad for bar food. Had the patty melt with turkey. They did a good job with it. But the one thing that was horrible was the service. We saw our waitress once maybe twice. After that, nothing."}
{"text":"they need to get rid of JUSTIN...just plain RUDE!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for some snacks. Happy hour menu was sticky (please clean) but the food was so yummy. We had the double dipped buffalo wings and a sample platter.  Buffalo wings were served hot, fresh and a crunchy.  The sauce was tangy, and spiciness was just the right!  A definite winner on the menu!  Next we ordered the sample platter which had a bit little of everything (potato skins, mozzarella sticks, wings, and zucchini) which were served hot and was full of flavor.  Our server was very friendly also and she left us alone to enjoy our food and conversation.  Water was kept full and appreciated.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Nice local restaurant. The portions were huge and service was great."}
{"text":"This place was hands down the worst restaurant I have ever been to. The service took forever, I don't think we have still got our menus and water...when you go to the bathroom, there is no soap to wash the hands, what a joke. Now to the review that everyone cares about, the food. Well I would rather have eaten the menu, I got the \"famous\" guac burger, and the bun was smashed, the lettuce was shriveled, and the burger patty, my goodness, I have never eaten a worse piece of meat. Zero flavor and it tasted like it had been just taken out of the freezer and thrown on the grill. I recommend if you're thinking about trying this place, go across the street to the McDonalds, you will have a much better experience."}
{"text":"UGGHHH UGGHH UGGHH!  2 friends & I stopped in for a bite to eat & a few drinks.  Immediately we should have known better. Upon entering the front door, there was no greeter, no sign saying, \" Please seat yourself\" or any evidence of a restaurant staff member.   We took a table in the bar anyway As we were the ONLY customers in the place it seemed rather odd we had to intermittently explore this small place to find anyone, anyone at all, who would bring us a total of 3 menus and 1 food server.   Our very annoyed server, Justin, sporting a greasy man bun, in addition to very dirty clothes,  tossed our the menus on the table. With sanitation being the key, all 3 menus were sticky & coated with fingerprints.  Still we stayed. Still, we ordered 3 glasses of water, 1 with lemon, 3 glasses of white wine & 1 slice of carrot cake. Pretty simple stuff.   At this juncture the true hilarity began. It took the highly-esteemed Justin literally, 15 minutes to bring 3 glasses of water all with a myriad of lemon slices.  Certainly, neat-o, had 1 friend not been allergic to citrus. Upon pointing this out, Mensa Member Justin stated, \"Just take them off.\" As this is NOT how allergies work, he rolled his eyes as he took glass of water away.  In sweet revenge he never brought back a new glass.   Then, came the infamous, \"Carrot Cake Incident.\"  Slacker-server, Justin thumped our slice of cake on the table, sans plates & napkins & utensils. This triangular block of cement was clearly masquerading as a slice of cake.  Obviously, we could see that it was FROZEN. Not cold but FROZEN!   Once again, upon enlightening super-server Justin of this situation, he emphatically stated, \"People don't order desert here so we keep it in the freezer.\" Then stalked away.   Never to return. . We never, received our wine. We didn't want to further confuse our  astute-server Justin. So we vowed, never to return.   Never. To. Return."}
{"text":"I have gone to 92nd street a handful of times. The one thing I would tell everyone, to go in on Sundays when Eric is working! He is the best bartender!!!! Very attentive, talkative, and makes awesome drinks!   This bar probably has some of the best food I have ever had a bar/restaurant! Everything I have gotten, has been really delicious!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this a \"zero\" rating. We've been in there quite a few times and each time it gets worse. Maybe it was a good at one time but not any longer. The second to last time I asked for a whiskey old fashioned. The bartender had no idea what I was asking for. I explained and she said ohhhhhh ya, I know what you're talking about. When the drink cane out it wasn't anything even close to an old fashioned. So, I asked for a whiskey and seven, she did great on that. Today we stopped there around 4:00, it was busy and we found 2 seats at the bar. We sat there for a while and then we were finally able to get the attention of one of the 3 bartenders. One of the bartenders was busy talking with her boyfriend at the end of the bar and in an in-depth conversation. We ordered our drinks and this is definitely a \"clicky\" type place. Bartenders are not friendly at all, just order takers. We asked her about the wings on the menu and she described how they cook them. I said okay could we get one order. She said ok, and walked away. 30 mins.. later no wings and they weren't busy at all by that time. Half the bar was empty, so I told my husband let's just get our bill and get out of here. So we got our bill from her, (the wings weren't even on it), and we paid and left. I told my husband, that's it, I'm done with this place, and we really are. There are LOTS of other places in the valley that would be more than happy to take our money."}
{"text":"The best thing about 92nd is the staff. This is my neighborhood bar and the staff has always been so nice and cheerful when I come in. There are other establishments to visit, but why? It has everything I need. Great food, fair prices and that amazing Staff again. It's clean, well managed and they treat everyone as a new friend. Anyone I've brought here has said the same thing. \"I love this Bar!\""}
{"text":"I have no idea why the rating on these guys is so low. Please ignore all other ratings and listen up: this is the dopest night you can have if you don't want a night club experience. Go to the mini golf place next to here, get some Ice cream next door then come get some dope karaoke at 92nd Street Cafe, order the hot wings and a Chocolate and peanut butter porter and try to get Tess or Chrissy. This place is awesome and every time we come it's off the chain. Enjoy and you're welcome people of AZ"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Boo. This will probably be the shortest review ever. Walked in. Sat down. We were not greeted. No one asked what we wanted to drink. Everyone was staring so...eventually we got up and walked out. As we walked I said....\"Guess we weren't meant to be greeted.\" Then one waitress said \"I can help you.\" By then, it was too late and we were out of the door.  I hate to pull the race card but.....what? Never again."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar during the day and night.  It is a Packer bar duing the football season and good to catch up with midwest fans.   The bartenders during the day are great, friendly and great service.   Last night, March 2013 went into have a cocktail and burger.  The \"blonde\" women bartenders are more into their looks and not customers.  Had to ask to order food, paid for the meal and never got a thankyou.   Go to the bar during the day, but stay away at night."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10 PM, waited 10 minutes, was acknowledged by the bartender, 5 minutes later still got no service. Walked out without even ordering. It's a shame because it seemed like a fun place.  The place seemed really cool from the outside and driving by I always I wanted to go. Recommended that a friend and I come here and was very disappointed. I hope this place gets it together, I think it has potential but service really needs to improve."}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood restaurant.  The food is pretty traditional, with items like steak, sandwiches and pasta on the menu.  The prices are very reasonable too, which makes this restaurant a good choice for those nights when you want a homecooked meal without having to cook it yourself!  I noticed that the staff seemed to know the names of quite a few diners.  It seemed like this would be a place filled with regulars, but that proved it to me.  And the staff is very warm and friendly, so I'm sure they make their regulars feel as if they're coming over to a friend's house for dinner, rather than a restaurant."}
{"text":"decent neighborhood place, lots of TV's to watch sports.  We went in on a slow night to grab some food and drinks.  The drinks were great, but the food came out really slow, even though there were not many people in the place.  Fish tacos were plentiful, but I have to say, not so impressed with the wings.  I was told they were double dipped to make them extra crispy.  Fine, but they were overcooked to the point of being dried up.  The service was pretty good, even though she seemed to disappear at times, and we had to wait to flag her down for service.  Another person behind the bar, or wiat staff might have helped this.  Worth another shot to see how I fare next time."}
{"text":"Stopped time for their all you can eat fish fry!! Started with clam chowder which was exceptional!! Then had the fish fry which was good but nothing exceptional...environment nice...lots of tv's to watch the game. Not sure if I will come back overall not bad!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar!! Sam, the incredible DJ, mixes it up and let's everyone have their 15 minutes during Karaoke. Carmit, the hot, exotic bartender, has a heavy hand when pouring drinks and the crowd is friendly. Great place!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the harsh reviews but they seem to be more for dinner/bar scene.  My first time here for breakfast/brunch Sunday around 11:30am (so don't know what's going on at night here) and there was a good amount of people but not packed. I got a $5 mimosa and a Denver Omelette which was really good. The omelette came with roasted potatoes (delicious) and a buttered English muffin (also delicious). It's a good casual, somewhat dive-bar-ish local place so as long as you aren't expecting fancy, it's all good! They had a bunch of tv's with the different football games on which was nice.  Even though I assume it turns into a bar at night, at this time there were a ton of families with young kids. The only possible negative is that it was really hot when I first got there. There are a ton of open windows so a lot of light comes in which isn't the best for summer maybe? Or maybe it was an off morning because I did cool down so they must've cranked the AC down a few extra notches. Which was definitely needed and appreciated.  I'm picky about breakfast food so was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came by here at around midnight on a Saturday.  I was expecting the typical dive bar type of scene.  Drinks were ok...probably what you should expect from a local neighborhood bar.  Was an average night until I saw the juke box.  I put in enough for 7 songs and started selecting.  During the first selection I heard another bar patron make a snide remark about the song.  To each their own.  However, the next thing I know the juke box volume was on minimum and the TV volume cranked up.  The song was not offensive and even if it was, it was still a selection in the playlist.  They make money off of the digital juke box but if they don't like your choice you just are out your $."}
{"text":"After weeks of seeing the \"Friday fish fry\" sign out front, I finally visited the place on Friday, September 16.  I was seated, and the waitress who took my order explained that it was the all-you-can-eat fish fry night, and did I want that?  I said I did.  They brought out the clam chowder soup.  A male employee came out and asked me how the soup was.  I replied that it was fine.  Then they brought out the plate of fish, French fries, and cole slaw.  The same male employee came out and asked me how the fish was.  I told him it was fine.  When I finished the fish, the male employee came out, took away my dishes, and handed me a bill.  In an \"all you can eat fish fry\" aren't they supposed to ask you if you want more fish?  Actually, I was thinking of having more fish, but with the abruptness of the male employee's action, I decided not to ask.  I suppose the sign outside, and waitress' remark about all-you-can-eat fish fry is just a come on to get people inside the door.  Most places, even without all-you-can-eat, will ask you if you want anything else, before they scoop up the dishes and hand you a bill.  I was disappointed.  The fish is okay, but the all-you-can-eat part is probably just a come on that they do not intend to fulfill.  If the management cares to respond, please do."}
{"text":"Solid service, good food, stiff drinks, and plenty of sports. Nothing fancy about this place - just a great local place to relax. Someone needs to get some inside pics uploaded... guessing that will be me."}
{"text":"We decided to try the 92nd Street Cafe after our first choice, a Chinese buffet, was surprisingly closed. My cousins recommended it having been there before. It's not a pretentious place by any means, but it is family-run, the menu is eclectic, and the food absolutely superb. In fact it reminded me of the Pinnacle Grille, maybe not as nice to look at, but which also serves great food at reasonable prices.  I had the Lemon Chicken. Awesome. My mother had the Chicken Piccata which is really Chicken Marsala but was also very good. Dad had the Chicken Fajita Salad, which he enjoyed. My cousins had the Stir Fry and Fried Shrimp respectively. I saw the burgers they serve, and I would definitely try those in the future - big, and plenty. Our waiter was Tony, the son of the owner, and he was extremely accomodating and nice. We don't exactly live around the corner from the cafe but it is a place I know we will be going back to and soon."}
{"text":"This place is a decent local watering hole. The people who hang out there are nice enough.  But I should never have to beg for a drink.  The bartender was too busy chatting up with some guys at the end of the bar that she could not be bothered to get me a drink.  So I went back to the patio sans drink.  My friends ask why I didnt get a drink? Because I don't want one so bad as to have to beg for it.  So rather than leave they talked me into waiting.  Eventually got drink.  Time to get drink #2. Went through the same process again.  So now I am thinking it's just me she is ignoring.  Then some other friends came in to join us.  My buddy sits down next to me at the bar and after about 5 mins of waving his hands in the air he turns to me and asks, \"What does a guy have to do to get a drink around here\"  Me: \"Welcome to 92nd Street Cafe\""}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the ONLY reason we went here was to be in a dive bar that wasn't too far from home. I wanted a divey place, without the North Scottsdale douche feel.  Got here super early, like at 7:00 and left sometime after midnight.  The waitress was THE BOMB!!!  She was super on top of everything. Water never got low, drinks never got low, she was friendly without being annoying.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Did order some appetizers, and they were all typical bar food.  Nothing really stood out as great, but when you're drinking, everything tastes pretty good.   Crowd was a mix of 20 something's to 60 something's.  On a scale from Ed Hardy to Affliction, I'd rate it in the middle as there were both!  lol  But all in all, it was a good time.  Listening to the wannabe American Idol contestants do karaoke was the highlight.  And even got the chance to see a few athletes.   All in all, I'd go back for dive bar night.  It was a nice change of pace!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. 1/17/15 my friends and I walked in around lunch time to have a quick beer. Upon seating, we waited 10 minutes before we had to flag down a waiter to put in an order for drinks. After ordering, 10 more minutes elapsed before our waiter returned to see if we needed anything else ... which we stated we were still waiting for our drinks. 10 minutes later he returned to let us know that a beer we ordered was out. (Which was listed on a giant chalkboard at the bar as a daily special) ... at which point we walked out. They showed total disregard for efficient service ... avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Best late night bar in the area!!! Cam, behind the bar is attentive & super sweet! Best place in the north scottsdale area to grab a quick drink & have a good time listening to karaoke!"}
{"text":"i use to go to 92nd st off and on then one night we went put in a song and i kept getting pushed back new people who  just came in got right up. i complained he said sorry overlooked you. food is ok but have had better. too dark in there. won't be back my group of friends and i or recommend."}
{"text":"What a dump.  Came in for lunch today. We had the worst waiter in history. I think his name was Jason or Justin.   Talk about a hateful attitude.  People before us walked out for lack of no service.   We should of done the same.  The place stunk like cigars and cigarettes. The doors are wide open with tables outside.  The smoke comes right in.   Just gross!  Thankfully the food was good!!'"}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me to write.  Have you ever felt like you wanted to like something, and whatever it was, was just kind of \"Meh...\" and you left wondering why?  Well that was my experience at 92nd St. Café.  My wife and I had an engagement on that side of town and we were about a half hour early so we thought we'd stop in for a drink first.  We walked in and sat at the bar, and my first impression was that it was a \"Neighborhood Bar\", as in, if you don't live in the \"neighborhood\" then this bar isn't for you.  It's hard to explain.  The patrons were mostly middle aged men and a couple of women.  We sat at the bar and were basically ignored for the first five minutes we were there while the bartender (picture Johnny Bravo from the cartoon network) talked on his cell phone, flirted with the female patron(s), and wiped down the glasses.  We were finally served by a really nice lady who appeared from the back of the restaurant and we were promptly served.  My wife had a Guinness and I had a Crown and Coke.  The pour was strong and the total was $11.  We noticed a sign proclaiming karaoke Wed-Sat from 9pm-1:30am.  We spied the karaoke setup in the corner and grabbed a book and saw they had a pretty decent selection of songs, so we decided to stop back by after our engagement and check it out.  Later that night, we returned, and karaoke was in full swing...well sorta.  There were two singers.  The host was doing his best to get other singers up, but just wasn't having much luck.  In between singers he played a mix of Lady Gaga and Kid Rock so it wasn't quite as awkward, although it was rather loud.  We were hungry so we ordered some food.  I got the sliders and my wife had the crab rangoon appetizer.  I didn't try the rangoon, but the sliders were fair.  The sliders consisted of basically a hamburger patty cut into quarters with cheese and grilled onions on top.  It was dark and I didn't notice the grilled onions when I read the menu or I would have declined as they don't agree with me.  But that was my fault not theirs.  We didn't end up singing because we just weren't feeling it, if you know what I mean.  But the waiter was super nice and very prompt.  It was a completely different crowd at night than it was earlier in the evening.  So would I go back? Maybe, if I was in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip to the place...again, for me, it was just \"Meh\"."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar/restaurant. Good food at reasonable price.  Waiter needs some lessons on Customer Orientation. First beer was FLAT, with no offer to take back or not charge. Guinness on tap was excellent. He seemed in a hurry to finish shift or whatever."}
{"text":"The food here was really good.  Cheap too.  I think it was $6.50 for nachos and it was a huge plate with real melted cheese on it.  And they didn't skimp on the cheese either.  We came here for karaoke and due to the realitively small turnout of singers, we were able to get several songs in.  Service was great.  I think Eric was his name- he was very accomodating and even gave our whole table a free round (there were 7 of us).  Comfortable seating, clean facility and it looked as if they had a great patio as well."}
{"text":"I have lived in Scottsdale for a little over a year and this is my favorite bar to come to.  The mixed drinks are nice and strong and the service is always good!  I usually go on karaoke nights and its always fun! Dawniel and Sam do an amazing job! There are tons of TVs with words on them so you can move around the bar and sing."}
{"text":"Worse than one star. One bar tender called my friend a cunt which was completely uncalled for. After four months of avoiding this bar my boyfriend and I gave it a second chance. Except I was refused service for my yelp review. I'm sorry, apparently this bar doesn't respect my rights, freedom of speech. I refuse to take my yelp review down when unfortunately the events explained in my review actually happened at that bar. No disciplinary action taken on a bartender who calls their customers a cunt but I am refused service for having a voice. Seems like an ass backwards system to me. Needless to say I will never go to this bar again. Congratulations 92nd st, you lost some really great customers."}
{"text":"So gross!!!! The bartender was so rude and threw my card and tab at me!!! Never have written a review or anything and tried to express my concern to the other barte. nder. She encouraged me to write a review on yelp. Sad bc it affects the girl who is so nice's tips!"}
{"text":"This place is a shit hole with incompetent and the rudest bartenders I've experienced. No draft beers? Recent unprofessional behaviors by the bartenders has confirmed that I will not be a patron again. I wanted to give no stars but the system wouldn't allow."}
{"text":"Thursday through Saturday karaoke is always a great time! Drinks are a decent price and it's never too crowded. Saturday nights are obviously the busiest and can be a lot of fun! Open to anyone from the tone deaf to the next winner of American idol.   Service can be a bit lagged but that's not why we come here."}
{"text":"The 92nd Street Cafe is a very nice place.  I give it 5-stars because I go there whenever I want a Monte Cristo sandwiich. I've had other menu items as well and they are also well prepared and a pleasure. However, their Monte Cristo is why I mostly visit.  They have some seating outside that's quiet and nice during the spring and fall.  Definitely an option for a nice afternoon meal."}
{"text":"My four stars is only about my most recent server, Amber.  Amber is 5 stars, but my previous experiences outside her in the last 2 years, are not.  I give the food 3 stars.  Previous servers 2-3 stars.  I never sat at the bar, so didn't meet any scathing bartenders that other reviewers wrote about.  I have eaten here at least 4 times in the last 2 years, and only because 92nd Street Cafe is on Local Flavor and also Dining for Miles.  I buy vouchers to eat here when LF has a sale, so I pay less than $10 for the $20 voucher, sometimes as little as $5  I have had mixed service, but I always order the same thing, because I love ribs.  And the full rack of ribs is the only menu item that will approach the $20 voucher.  The full rack of 12 ribs is only $17.00 and I upgrade the fries to sweet potato fries and order a Bud Light.  $17 for a full rack is the most reasonable price I know of, for a full rack, unless you go to Golden Corral. Here, it includes soup or salad, and slaw, I always get the soup.  One time it was french onion soup, very good!    The ribs are on the dry side, and the BBQ sauce is very tart.  I like a sweeter sauce.  I come here and eat the soup, drink my beer, eat half of the sweet potato fries, eat about 4 of the ribs, and take the rest home for another meal or two, to which I add more veggies or salad, and add honey to the leftover BBQ sauce.    I have had mixed service, and like other reviewers complained, I have never once been greeted and seated when I come in.  I don't care, I go and seat myself.  And if a server does not come to me, I get up and go to the bar, get a menu, and get someone there to take care of my needs.  I always eat alone, but they have free WiFi and I bring my tablet for company.  Sometimes my service is nil, other than bringing me the entree.  But the last time I ate here was on March 16, 2017.  I got an exceptional server I've never seen here before.  Amber brought me a menu when my butt was just sliding into the booth.  I told her I already knew what I wanted.  Unlike the other times I used vouchers, where I might be less than 50 cents under the $20, Amber insisted that I had to max out on the $20 and not even be a few pennies under.   So she kept adding up my efforts to pad the $17 ribs, till I was over the $20.  When I told her it was never like that before, they just subtract what I order from the $20 (less than $1 under), she said the management was cracking down, and they will no longer do that, I had to order AT LEAST $20.    Amber came to check on me at least 5 times \"How are you doing?\"  \"Still doing OK?\"  I do not recall that any server here had ever stopped by to check if I needed anything.  Amber also saw that I was going to need a take out box, and brought me one, without me first asking for it.    If every server especially at the bar, were as attentive as Amber, the Yelp ratings for 92nd Street would be much higher.    Check out my photos and see what I get for $5-$8 Local Flavor voucher for $20 food.  With tax and tip I end up paying maybe $5 more than what I paid for the voucher.  A good deal for the 2 meals I get out of the full rack of ribs."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very good, it took me a long time to get  a drink even though it wasn't busy. I had no trouble parking, even when it was busy. The food was middle of the road and the restrooms weren't clean. I didn't hate it but after a couple tries, I won't return."}
{"text":"We were not greeted or seated upon arrival.  Wine was warm & michelada...well it wasn't.  Food was ok. Service not great. I would not come back or recommend."}
{"text":"Great location on the North end of the Scottsdale Greenbelt, unfortunately the food is average at best, bathrooms smell and are unkept, the female bartending staff (especially Tommi) is arrogant and slow.  The male bartenders pick up the slack.  Lame for a Packer bar."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome if you treat them with respect, because they are busy and deal with a lot, as long as you treat the bartenders with respect they will reciprocate.. I left a bad review before and I regret it every day I come back... Just act like you wanna be treated and the bartenders will be the same way."}
{"text":"Stop by early afternoon on a Saturday, walked around looking for a host/hostess, I was not acknowledge at all, the place looks dirty and smells of cigarette smoke, although there was no one smoking. I was afraid to take an available seat and not be served or totally ignored. So I left I went to another area restaurant that is a delight."}
