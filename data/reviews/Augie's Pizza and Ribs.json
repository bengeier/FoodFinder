{"text":"This is becoming my go-to lunch spot. Pizza by the slice is great!  Today I pre-ordered a veggie calzone it was perfect!"}
{"text":"I have never had their Pizza.  Their Ribs are outstanding. We get the family pack deal every summer holiday and eat them at the park.  Outstanding always the same. Meaty falling off the bone ,huge slabs.  I would recommend them over most BBQ places."}
{"text":"I've been getting pizzas from Augie's for many years now, and I'm always very satisfied with them. Recently, I tried their ribs, and they were amazing!!! The ribs were baby back ribs, and were cooked the regular restaurant-style way (they're not smoked like Southern-style ribs). I got a 1/2 slab, which contained 6 ribs, and they had plenty of meat on them. They had very good flavor, they were very tender and fall-off-the-bone, and the sauce was very unique. The sauce was sweet with a little taste of honey, and a little bit of spice. The pizzas are very good, but as with any pizza place,  picking the right toppings for your pizza is very important. I don't really care for their pepperoni, because they put the pepperoni underneath the cheese, but that's just my personal preference. Despite that fact, I have enjoyed most of their other toppings that I have tried over the years. Overall, Augie's has very good food with an extensive menu (they do catering as well), and I've enjoyed their pizzas for many years."}
{"text":"Stopped in today. All three female employees looked and acted strung out. Got two slices to go and watched one of the employees in back COUGH INTO HER HAND BEFORE PUTTING ON A GLOVE WITHOUT WASHING. I was too dumbfounded to realize I should just ask for my money back and leave. By the time I got to the car I was so grossed out that I threw the pizza in the trash and went to Wendy's. I won't return to Augie's. Zero stars."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was good but small. Basically a 6 inch sub. The Italian hoagie was terrible. The cheese on the hoagie was grated pizza cheese. They also forgot the hot peppers. Will never visit again."}
{"text":"Best pizza around Independence Ohio is Augies pizza! Best slices & great friendly hardworking staff!!! Defiantly a place to check out! Cleaner than the other shops in town, nice dining area, best over all is the sauce, award winning back in 2015!"}
{"text":"Tried Augie's Pizza for the first time last night.  Romito's is normally our go-to place in Independence (although it isn't my personal favorite pizza), and we have tried Angie's as well.  I probably like both Romitos and Angie's more than Augie's, after one order at least.  My husband was already out when I called in the order and he planned to stop on his way home to pick up the pizza.  I asked if we could use one of the coupons from their website without actually printing it and bringing it in, but they said no.  A bit scroogy, but whatever.  Rules are rules.  We got 2 large pizzas, one with pepperoni and one with mushroom (canned.  sigh). Both pretty much looked like plain cheese when we opened them.  The toppings were scarce and covered by a thick layer of greasy cheese.  I liked the flavor of the sauce and the thickness of the crust (thin but not quite a thin crust).  But the slices were too floppy so you couldn't really pick one up and take a bite without it collapsing.  It's either way too much cheese or maybe not a good type of cheese for their style of pizza bc you go to take one bite and all the cheese comes off the whole slice.    I like that their menu has more variety, especially in the salads department, than the other area pizza shops, and the prices are comparable.  The pizza is fine, but not the best.  Probably won't be back any time soon bc there are so many other places to try."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza, just not that good.  They say they won best sauce in Cleveland, but I would have to disagree.  It wasn't that flavourful, which is the same I would say for the crust.  On a good note, the cheese is pretty good, on the other hand they are extremely stingy with the toppings, which were mediocre anyhow.  They are very friendly, and its not a huge chain, so I'd definatly go here before one of the lame corporations, but there are better choices, some of them very close-by."}
{"text":"The pizza is greasy and weighs a ton. Two pluses.  The slices are small, but again, they are dense. I also like how the toppings \"look\" and how they are incorporated into the slice. They're not just piled on top, ready to fall off. Nor are they completely hidden underneath the cheese (a la Teresa's). It's perfect.  Just had a plain, now slowly but surely getting my way (weigh) through a mushroom. Great pizza!!! I am digging this sauce.  The cheese is great; however, I could never see ordering extra cheese because there seems to be an abundance of it already.   Nice people here too!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel in Independence, in town a night early for a wedding.  Needed something to eat and didn't want suburbia chain food.  Ordered a deluxe mini pizza (not on the menu but they were nice enough to make one for me), fried ravioli, spicy garlic wings, Italian calzone, and side salad.  Pizza was good, not great. Toppings were incredibly fresh and high quality but sauce and crust were just OK.  Calzone was very good. Perfect balance of pastry vs. filling and a good-sized filling.  Fried ravioli was bland and a bit lifeless, even with marinara or ranch.  Wings - spicy garlic sauce was recommended by the staff and the sauce was excellent. Wings themselves were OK.  Salad was meh... just a lot of iceberg, some shredded cheese, 4 olives and 2-3 grape tomatoes. Ma's Italian dressing was OK -- a bit sweet.  Service was friendly but a bit slow -- it was nice of them to make a deluxe in mini-size for me.  Ambience is just a very plain lunch counter type place in a strip mall.  They do pizza by the slice for lunch on weekdays for nearby offices -- might be a good quick option.  All in all a decent non-chain alternative for a quick take-out or eat-in meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza ever! I love the service and the employees are always so nice and make you feel welcome. It's a cute little family type pizza joint with great fresh by the slice pizza and the BEST ribs around. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"I have to say that watching Restaurant Impossible and Bar Rescue has opened my eyes on how filthy some bars and eateries are these days.  The first thing I noticed about Augie's was the dirty air duct ABOVE the area where pizza sits (see picture below).  This is the sort of thing that floats down onto the food.  This also shows a complete lack of attention to detail by management.  Second, I noticed underneath the hotpad where display pizza sits was incredibly dirty.  Bugs would definitely be attracted to that.  What is infuriating is it would take all of a minute to wipe down with bleach/water.    Now onto the pizza...it was terrible to say the least.  Heavy and lacking in cheese and other toppings.  The crust was slightly burnt and hard.  Not to mention I paid over $16 for a \"large\" pizza which looked more like a medium from Domino's.  I felt completely ripped off.    In a time when money is tight, I would highly recommend you stay away from this place.  The dirt alone is reason to believe their food is not safe.  Then when you actually taste the pizza it becomes clear - - they are not concerned with producing a quality produce which makes people come back.  I predict this place will be closed within a year.    NOTE:  The paint job in the place is nice as is the floor.  But don't let that fool you.  Look BEHIND the counter and then judge.  Newspapers were all over the counters and the cooking area was messy.  Not good signs.     I hope management reads this and does something about it.  Otherwise their business will slowly wither away and they will close."}
{"text":"I had the pizza by the slice for lunch.  I was pretty good and definitely satisfying.  Normally I'm a fan of big floppy pieces of new York style pizza, but this was not too shabby, close to work and very affordable.  Would eat again."}
{"text":"Great pizza - order it frequently for the office. Conveniently located off the freeway on Rockside Road. Meat Lovers pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"Had this delivered to our Hotel Room last night at the Doubletree. Avery good pizza and a very polite delivery man. I will definitely drop in if I am ever this was again."}
{"text":"Fantastic breadsticks -- some of the best I've ever had. Wack pizza. Lady was super nice on the phone."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, plain and simple.  The customer service they provide is their best topping.  The people behind the counter are always very happy, friendly and engaging.  They have great lunch specials (2 slices and a can of soda for $5).  Everytime I get the lunch special, the slices are hot, fresh and they offer a wide variety.  Definitely not your Pizza Hut lunch buffet pizza.  The shop is always clean and they have a nice area to sit and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"To my surprise I never knew there was an Augies in Independence.  I stopped here to get my hubby a late night treat. He grew up eating Augies pizza from the original spot in Warrensville Heights when it was owned by the D'Aminico's. Since that Augies has new ownership he said the place and the pizza is a \"hot mes\".. If you go to Augies website all the other stores claim no relationship with the Warrensville pizzeria (HINT HINT).  When we moved to Streetsboro he was elated to find there was an Augies in South Russell owned by Mr. & Mrs. Jenks.  He was even more excited when he found out I went to school with one of Jenks daughters and son in law.  Its been a while since patroning Augies because my husband's favorite pizzeria is Angelos in Lakewood and he's willing to burn gas and rubber on that hour long trek to get his pizza.  So I ordered his usual as I usually do. Medium, regular crust, light sauce, light onion, pepperoni, sausage, well done. It looks like an Augies pizza but his taste buds will be the ultimate judge. I took a picture.  Update 3/8/2014: The old man approves of his Augies pizza. Thank Goodness. It's hard work trying to keep the hungry spouse well feed."}
{"text":"Cleveland is a decent food town and has enough Italian heritage to know good pizza.  Why places like Augie's are propped up as a positive pizza experience is inexplicable.   I had a slice of black olive.  It is incredibly cheap and you get what you pay for. Excessive grease on a pizza is the sign of low cost, low quality cheese.  Augie's clearly falls into that category.  The sauce has little discernible flavor and the canned black olive slices resemble the flavor of the material of the can. You should know better Cleveland.  This is the pizza equivalent of Taco Bell. Don't waste the calories here."}
{"text":"UPDATED Review:  Get extra cheese - it's really good. Super thick, although they do charge extra for it. Also LOVE their house salad dressing. Another plus for me is that you can order the wings plain with sauce on the side, so if you have people that like different sauces, it makes it easier to mix and match.   The food is solid. The only problem is their service level. They have these coupons and they post them on their website. Currently, they only allow you to use them if you print them out. In this mobile world, who does that? The thing is that the coupons actually don't say you have to print them out! It says they either must be presented or mentioned at the time of order. Only mentioning is not good enough - even though that is what the coupon states! False advertising? Frankly, there are other pizza places that have just as good pizza, but have better a better service level."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I am from out of town and needed something quick - checked out pizza in Independence OH and found that Augie's had good reviews and also won the best sauce in town in 2015. I ordered their regular which is triple pepperoni and double cheese. The premise of this pizza is that once you order it, you'll be a regular. They were right. I can tell you that whenever I'm back in town and in the mood for pizza, they'll get my business. Good pizza! Nice job guys."}
{"text":"Very rude over the phone.  I canceled my order.  There are too many options for pizza to deal with poor customer service. The guy was even rude when I called and cancelled.  He did not even ask why I cancelled.  Stay away from this place.  If they do not respect that we have the money that keeps them in business, then we should not support them."}
