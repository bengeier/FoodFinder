{"text":"One star is far too much for this place, have been a loyal customer for years, the food was great but now it's just plain disgusting, they served me old spoiled ceviche for one, and their sopa de bola gets smaller Everytime I order it's embarrassing the portions especially for the price, and they Quaker is pure water! It doesn't even taste like authentic Quaker, they are not worth your time or money, save your self the hassle this place just sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Ecuadorian Empanadas  -  Cheese.  Beef.  I approve.  Reminds me of Pillsbury Pizza Pops rather than McCain Pizza Pockets. At least the ones made at El-Tipico Ecuatoriano, pretty tasty snack i n g. Much more airy pastry than the Chilean or Mex doughy variations. Shell looks crispy but surprised it doesn't shatter apart after the bite. Underneath the Shell becomes a slight chew therefore best of both worlds.  Ceviche Mixto($12.00)  -  Not my type.  Adios Muchacho   Memories of Tasty Thursday at Nathan Phillips Square all over again. Even so, the saving grace is the Picante Dipping Sauce.   2.5'd I do not doubt Latin Americans can make a mean Aji/Picante Sauce. Like Magic it turns anything flavourless into flavourmore.  Bonus Points:  UFC shown in Espa√±ol(+0.5 Star)"}
{"text":"Has to be a preferred favourite Ecuadorian restaurant in all of North York.   I always happen to order of filet de pescado (fish fillet) that comes with a side of rice, salad, and sliced plantain chips.  I always opt for the yellow plantain over the green...  It is more sweeter.    Now for that aji...  Which I suppose is garlic based amongst other items added to the mix.  Truly makes for an amazing hot sauce.  I practically dump the entire bowl on the my dish.   For a treat, sometimes the empanadas with cheese are great with sugar sprinkled on top.    Tamales are always hard to come by, but it is worth asking for the humita or tamale de pollo.    Because you can always buy canned pop anywhere... The choice in drinks are amazing and worth trying.  Quaker or Chicha are most common and have an authentic taste that you can't find anywhere in north American cuisine or beverages for that matter."}
{"text":"Four stars just because of the pricing... I'm an Asian grown at Ecuador, and i can say that this place is very close to what i used to eat down there... Definitely here is a most visit place.  I had brought some friends here and all of them love it.. But because of the price, once after a while is fine... On the other hand, i don't think it will be possible to find a cheaper Ecuadorian Food in Toronto lol  Must try: - Encebollado (Call before heading to the restaurant, is the first thing that will be sold) - Ceviches - Seco de Pollo / Carne / Chivo - Fritada  If you come with a bunch of friends you should try everything at once :D"}
{"text":"After they changed the owner this place just went downhill. They are charging $5 for a bottle of Inca Kola!! That's called abuse, basically $5 for sugar and water. I just wish there were more Ecuadorean restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Prices were reasonable. Amazing food! Had the carne empanadas to start. Really tasty along with their home made hot sauce (not so much of a sauce, more like a salsa). Followed with the seco de carne as my entree. Love it! I always come back for it. Reminds me of home. However it is a very small space. The very tasty food make up for it."}
{"text":"Nova Era Bakery O Cantinho Bakery Vannis Ristorante Ellington's Music Cafe Mi Tierra Restaurant Banh Cuon Thanh Truc  El- Tipico Ecuatoriano R  El-Tipico Ecuatoriano is the Sixth Stop for Our November Food Crawl.  After a little time out, we ready for a snack! Ecuador, a country I never visit as yet and I left the ordering with my Yelp Friend.  A little confusion of what we ordered and who we ordered made us waited for food that never arrived?  The Cheese Empanada has this ooey gooey texture, while the Beef Empanada has a really moist filling. The baked shell was flaky and soft at the same time. I really enjoyed both of them!  Ceviche with various Seafood ($12) - I almost mistaken this bowl of soup seafood as the Seafood Soup that we ordered - The \"broth\" the fully cooked shrimps, squid and fish were marinated in has really light citrus taste. I found the seafood really rubbery. My Yelp Friend though quietly ate the whole order with a heavy dose of hot sauce - Toasted corn kernels was offered to us as a side dish to go with the Ceviche which I secretly wish I can wash them down with a beer!  Seafood Soup ($12) which availabe only during the weekend never came...and when we followed up on our order, it was sold out!  What I would remember the most for my meal at El-Tipico definitely is NOT the food... This would be the night that I watched a UFC fight which last around 5 min from the pre show till the end...... That's definitely a change from CP 24!  KNOCKOUT!!   I think I am ready for dessert!!   NEXT!"}
