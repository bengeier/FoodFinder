{"text":"Overpriced, super small portions, slow service and tasteless food . Over 50.00 for a very bad breakfast for 3 people. The coffee was good. As I walked out I felt as if I had been robbed."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever. The gravy is so good I wanted to drink it (don't judge), the cheese churds were fresh and squeaky, the fries nicely browned. My husband and I both had the burger with brie and caramelized onions and it was fantastic. Great selection of local beers. Good kids menu with some more interesting food than just pizza or fries."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. We're from Toronto so we know a good meal and service.

Terrible food and even worse service. Our waitress forgot our soup starter and brought our mains (tapas) without any sideplates. She still put the soup on our bill despite forgetting it and bringing it after our main course. She did not stop by to ask how our meals were or if we needed condiments etc. we had to flag her down for ketchup and  more drinks and pop is not unlimited ($4 for a tiny glass of pop-- but fries were all u can eat???!!!)

The eggplant caviar was so horrible and bland and the poutine was absolutely disgusting-- think cheese curds that don't melt and LIGHT PINK sweet gravy. The fries were totally soggy. 

The only good thing we ate were the mini burgers and they have guinness on tap. Still not redeeming qualities in a way overpriced shitty pub. Don't waste your time !!!!"}
{"text":"The ambience is cozy, fun and enjoyable.  The food is great and the service fabulous, all at a fair price.  Center of town location makes it for a great stop when in St. Sauveur!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here recently, and it was delicious!  They had some turnip and carrot soup that honestly sounded a little strange, but was one of the most delicious soups I've ever had.  The waitress was nice and gave very good service, all the food was delicious, and the beer was good.  We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good for drinks but don't try the food. It's very touristic place! Horrible food! Good service! Good ambiance! Good drinks!"}
{"text":"Expérience extraordinaire, tout le personnel, sans exception, nous a donné un service hors pair.
Et que dire de la nourriture, wow!!! Ma conjointe et moi avons été comblé. L'entrée de mini tartiflette et charcuterie n'a rien a envier aux tartiflettes des Alpes Françaises. J'ai ensuite continué avec le risotto aux champignons sauvages, que je n'ai pu terminer, les assiettes sont assez copieuses.
Ma conjointe a pris l'entrée de torchon de foie gras, que j'ai eu le plaisir de goûter, à part les croûtons pas assez croustillants à notre goût, c'était vraiment très bon. La suite pour elle était le tartare de saumon, aussi sans faille.
En résumé, service et nourriture haut de gamme, nous y retournerons assurément!!!"}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast EVER!!!
It came with these amazing au gratin potatoes, a brownie, a smoothie shot, toasted baguette, fruit and homemade jam plus the bacon and eggs !!
So good!!
Will be returning 
Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of the village, where all the other restaurants are located. It's right on a corner and therefore very loud in summer if you're sitting on the terrace. 

Service: Average. Nothing about it blew me away. 

Food: They refer to themselves as being a 'gastro-pub' and maybe they are, however based on my experience, I beg to differ. Granted, I'm basing my review on one visit. I stopped in with my mom for lunch on a Saturday, and we decided to share a club sandwich. This came with fries and slaw. 

First off, they charged us for sharing the club sandwich, which is completely ridiculous considering all you need to do is bring one extra plate and we can transfer half of the damn thing onto it ourselves. Perhaps if the sandwich had been worth the price that they charged for it, I wouldn't complain. But this wasn't the case. The bread was cold, there was next to no chicken, and taste-wise, it was totally bland. The slaw was ordinary and the fries seemed to be frozen as opposed to homemade. Definitely not worth the price. 

For the same price (maybe less), you can enjoy pretty decent fare at Ye Olde Orchard, which is just down the street."}
{"text":"Bien mais on voudrait des portions plus grandes !

Le menu est attrayant avec des bons plats français et de bons desserts mais les portions sont modestes ! Il y a beaucoup de bruits mais en même temps, c'est un pub aussi !

Très bien entre amis !"}
{"text":"A bit touristy but still food is good and good vibe. Service is good and the food is good. At night there is music, during the summer all the large windows are open, good drinks, it's rather enjoyable I won't lie. One of the good layback spots in the area. Solid breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch.  Good service, good food for a pub,  and wine and beer selection.  Warm mulled wine really the spot."}
{"text":"Le seul pub ouvert un lundi à St Sauveur et ce fut fort apprécié! Cet hiver un superbe bar de glace vous accueille, il est donc possible de boire son verre en extérieur comme à l'intérieur. Le service est excellent, notre serveuse s'est donnée à fond pour nous trouver une adresse de queue de castor dans le coin (même si malheureusement l'établissement était lui aussi fermé ce lundi là). Nous n'avons pris qu'un verre mais la carte était attrayante, alors retour obligé si passage improvisé à Saint Sauveur!"}
{"text":"Belle décoration, mais la nourriture est vraiment mauvaise. J'ai mangé la salade César revisitée et ça goûtait juste la moutarde de Dijon. Mon conjoint a pris la soupe à l'oignon. On lui a servi un bouillon de graisse sans saveurs; de plus les croûtons étaient brûlés. Le propriétaire doit embaucher un chef ASAP!!!-"}
{"text":"J'y vais plusieurs fois par mois pour déjeuner.
Totalement différent d'ailleurs. Le meilleur déjeuner en ville c'est bien vrai. Le personnel qui est en place depuis longtemps (en particulier) sont très agréable et accommodant. Toujours beaucoup de gens à l'intérieur, ça dit tout. Superbe emplacement dans le village. Un propriétaire qui est souvent présent sur place ça fait toujours une différence dans l'expérience client. Sur la coche comme on dit!"}
{"text":"We just had an incredible dinner!  Kids had poutine.  My son scooped up every last bit of gravy.  The bison burger was cooked perfectly.  The veal chop melts in your mouth.  The staff was very friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Portion are decent and the prices are fair. I had he Brie burger and a poutine. Both Delicious! If you're in the mood for a yummy burger and fries and looking for somewhere trendy come here. I would highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Actually wanted to give 3.5/5 

My review: went here to celebrate something special. I know the area well, I've worked here and went often with the boys here ( village not pub ). 

We were planning only to go for a drink but we were a bit hungry, thinking about getting a little appetizer. I took a pign? coloda & my gf took a \"limonade gourmante\" with alcohol ( you also have without any alcohol). 

The drinks were good nothing bad to say, I'm really not a big alcohol fan: but this was good. 

The appetizer... yeah disappointed 
Service: took about 20-25 minutes 
( for only the appetizer ) we took our drinks and then decide to have a snack.

Yeah it wasn't great, the waitress told us that it was like \"Nachos\". It was really not like nachos ... it tastes like dried / fried pasta. We had sour cream with it but they added lemon juice with it ... not great. Also has salsa but not a lot ... I really don't suggest this \"appetizer/ snack\". 

I don't go out often / to bars and etc:
It was like 30$ for the both of us ... would rather go somewhere to eat and have a \"real meal\" than a crappy appetizer and 2 drinks.
Personnel preference* 

Have any tips for a guy that likes discovering things: give me a tip!"}
