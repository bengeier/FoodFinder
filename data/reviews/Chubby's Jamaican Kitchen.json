{"text":"Literally 10/10! I came here with a large group of people and the Chubby's staff were very accommodating. The atmosphere is impeccable and the smell of wood fired jerk chicken permeates the air.  The music is on point and this was the best Jamaican food I've ever had. And you must try the carrot cake, it is to die for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"This place fits the profile for a typical King West  Restaurant - Good service, modern and fun ambiance (I especially liked that they maintained the original architecture of the house), great cocktails, and overpriced \"ok\" food. The jerk chicken itself was amazing but the rest of the food fell flat (patties, oxe tail soup, okra, and jerk pork)...it just wasn't as authentic as I had hoped and they should really stop calling their hot sauce \"hot\" because it was quite the opposite!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The menu has a great selection, the environment is warm and welcoming, the music is great and the service was awesome. The restaurant itself is a little small and they have small tables to accommodate that, but just keep what you need at your table and it works well. The Jamaican patties were fantastic - an order comes with two veggie patties and two turkey patties. Both flavours were very good, I would definitely order them again. I also ordered the goat curry while I  was there. The meat was so soft and perfect! Great flavour as well :) Chubbys is a must visit! (Make a reservation!)"}
{"text":"Imagine going to dinner at a Jamaican restaurant in King West and ordering a jerk chicken as your entree and pay $14 for a quarter chicken.  What gets me is that usually I get a rice and peas with coleslaw and some oxtail sauce to come with it.  Forget about!!! Your gonna get juiced for $7 bucks for a single bowl of rice and peas.  If you buy a whole chicken your gonna pay more for rice and peas than the chicken!!! WTF!!!!  Rice should never cost this much!!!!! Ever!!!! C'MON!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. So many reviews about how authentic and great the Jamaican food is and the vibe of the restaurant.  First, the restaurant itself, decor is nice. The music is good, all and all a nice place, but that's about it. I would probably only come back for drinks and hang out and not the food sadly.  We ordered a lot of things off the menu.  Starters: fried salt fish cakes, pepper shrimp and the beef patties.   The patties tasted just alright, some where completely bland the taste of the pastry itself was just ok. It wasn't flaky like you expect patties to be with a warm filling. The overall was a soggy/soft middle and flaky sides and just bland filling. Everyone who likes patties knows what's good and trust me if you think these are good you really need to go to Eglinton West and hit up some of the Jamaican spots and try good patties.    The salt fish cakes. First you need to soak the salt fish properly so it's not too salty. Second why are they burnt to a crisp? The end result was a burnt, crispy outside layer and a soggy filling with a overly salty taste and no real flavour at all.  The pepper shrimp. I know some people leave the shell on and cook but in this case it should have been removed. It was basically cooked in a tomato, mildly spicy sauce. And just bland. Tasted more creole, Louisiana shrimp then Jamaican/West Indian pepper shrimp.  So for apps: 0   For the main we ordered the half jerk chicken and the jerk pork. Side: rice and peas, and fried plantains.  The chicken had a good flavour and was actually the only thing I was somewhat impressed by. Good flavour, a little dry but at least it tasted good.  The jerk pork was cooked well, but that's about it, the flavour was non-existent, and bland.  The sides were ok. Rice and peas, ok. The fried plantain was horrible. Good plantain has good flavour and if fried correctly is not dry as hell inside, and sadly this was.   Entrees: 1 good thing, jerk chicken.  All in all for the owner to say this is the first real Jamaican place in Toronto. First you should maybe get outside the city and try real Jamaican places that will not only give you amazing food you don't have to pay double the price for someone interpreting Jamaican food and that's what this place is doing. A sad interpretation of Jamaican cuisine."}
{"text":"Holy crap, that was good. My grandmother would be impressed. I'm gonna have to bring my mom here so she can have someone else make Jamaican food. Haha!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and tasty food. Sort of a westernized take on Jamaican styles, but yummy. Plenty of spiciness in the food - in fact it's really spicy. Faint of tongue need not apply. Sat outside in front on a nice sunny day. I would definitley return again."}
{"text":"Great Great food at Chubby's. We had the fritters Jamaican patties and the fried okra. We also had the jerk chicken with slaw and we had the goat curry. The only thing missing was roti from the menu! Haha! Everything was fantastic. The service was great and the staff was friendly. The restaurant has a great vibe to it and the music is fun. We had a variety of different cocktails as well. The hibiscus Mojito was one of my favorites. To top it all off we had the carrot cake sponge for dessert. If you're looking for a trendy, cool Jamaican place in the city this is definitely it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because we were excited it was a new place to try out and we both love this kind of cuisine.  It's a really chill vibe in here with super friendly staff but it all just felt a little too...\"North American-ized\" for me. This is a great place to bring a date or out-of-towners who want the more touristy experience of getting this kid of food in Toronto but for going out to get Jamaican food? Not so much.   The rating I am giving of not a real Jamaican food experience AKA a hipsterized version was exemplified by the fact that when we asked for a spicier sauce than the 2 options they had out on all the tables already we were told by our server that there weren't any and, further, the sauces they had out USED TO BE spicier when Chubby's first opened but the customers complained that it was too spicy. I totally get wanting to please your customer base and, of course, any smart owner would do so but it was not to my taste. This is why I am only docking them a star because the food, service, and ambiance were all very good.  A bit pricier than your average Jamaican food place too in my experience, but again, you have to look at the location and the crowd it is attracting to understand why this place is the way it is - and I do not blame them."}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Chubby's!! The food, music, service, and overall vibe was ON POINT. We came here with a group of friends on a Friday night and ordered a bunch of things to share. It ended up costing around $55 a person (including drinks!!). Pretty reasonable for a restaurant in the heart of entertainment district.   Here's a round up of my top 3 dishes:   - Jerk Chicken (1 whole easily fed 5 people) and a side of fried okra. The okra is a MUST. $36 + $6 - Pepper shrimp $16 (the mango sauce is FIRE!! Too good.)  - Likkle Jamaican patties (both turkey and coconut are amazing) $10  We also got a few other items like the goat curry ($17) and the saltfish fritters ($12) which were also good, but not top 3 material.   As for the cocktails, they're OK. I like how they're generous with the alcohol but some of the mixes weren't really working for me. We tried about 8-10 different drinks and the ones I would go back for are the hibiscus mojito and \"everything nice\"  TIPS: - Make resos a week or more in advance and request to be seated upstairs  - If you're really into spicy food, ask for the Scott bonnet dust   Overall I was really impressed with this place and can't wait to go back again. This time I'll be trying the curry chicken and slow baked jerk wings.   Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambience: 5/5  Price: 4/5"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at chubby's and I recommend sharing plates amongst the table as the food is meant to be shared. There's a bit of a twist on the food and it was absolutely delicious. If you have a chance, sit upstairs since it's so bright and lovely!  We enjoyed all of our dishes, especially the okra and ox tail!"}
{"text":"A very different sort of Jamaican dining experience than what I'm accustomed to.  Most Jamaican places I've been to in Toronto and elsewhere are typically hole in the wall type places that (might) have excellent food at bargain basement prices.  This place is much more upscale and posh.  And while the prices are higher than most Jamaican places, you're getting a nice dining experience along with the food which (in my opinion) was very good.  My friends and I tried some jerk chips as an appetizer, half a jerk chicken entree (which came with coleslaw), jerk pork (which came with seasonal greens), curry goat (which came with jasmine rice and mango chutney) along with fried plantains, rice and peas, and oxtail gravy.  The jerk chips were amazing both in terms of flavour and texture and they were literally gone within a minute.  The jerk chicken and jerk pork were both nice.  I'm usually a big fan of pork and not a big fan of chicken but when it came to Chubby's jerk dishes, I actually preferred the chicken as I found it juicier and more succulent.  But both were seasoned well with hot, spicy, and slightly sweet notes all present.  They also came with some excellent sauces (mango and guava) which really added to the jerk dishes.  And the curry goat was nicely spiced and tender which is quite the feat as goat can be horribly tough if not cooked properly.     The side dishes were also fantastic, arguably even stronger than the main dishes.  I personally hate coleslaw as I can't stand mayonnaise but I couldn't detect any mayo in Chubby's coleslaw and I found it refreshing and cooling to the palate.  The seasonal greens were also great in that they were tender without being overcooked like some greens can often be.  The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly yet it was the mango chutney that stole the show for me as it had an irrestible blend of sweet, spicy, salty, tart, and hot flavours going on. Arguably even better was the rice and peas with some oxtail gravy spooned over it as the gravy had an amazingly rich flavour that was addicting.  And the fried plantain was fried to perfection.    What I really appreciated about the food was that it was clear that everything was made with a lot of care and attention.  Everything was not only fresh but all the dishes were seasoned and cooked well with a good amount of heat but not so much where you can't taste anything else.    Overall, I left very satisfied with both the food and service as I enjoyed what I ate and both the front-door and wait staff were super-polite and pleasant to interact with.  I'm definitely coming back to this place if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place and definitely worth the wait. The atmosphere is so cool and the service is great. I had the pepper shrimp which was pretty spicy bit delish. I also had the jerk chicken which was pretty great but the show stealer was definitely the curry goat, it was AMAZING. I was so happy to be eating. Def recommend this place!! Be prepared for a wait so just put your name down and then go for a walk, it's a nice area anyways."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here last weekend, and I couldn't have picked a better place to ring in the last year of my twenties!   As a young Canadian Jamaican, Chubby's is what I have always conceptualized when I wanted to eat Jamaican food out at a nice restaurant -- a cool, upscale spot, with good music, authentic food, and good vibes! :) It certainly delivers on all of those fronts.   Here are my thoughts (buckle up, this is a long one!):   RESERVATIONS: You can book online, but if the time you want isn't available, just call; they may still be able to find you a table. Also, if you leave a message on their reservation answering machine, they will actually call you back (*gasps*).   FOOD:  The short answer -- very well made, authentic Jamaican food, with great presentation.   There were 6 of us, so we ordered a lot of food and tasted quite a bit of each others.   Here's a few of the dishes that we had and my thoughts:   Ackee and Salt Fish Bites: This is ackee and salt fish served inside a fried dumpling. Two typical Jamaican breakfast dishes presented in such a fun way! It was a really nice touch. I would order again.   Jamaican Patty (turkey):  Great flavour, lots of meat inside, and nice flakey crust. If I remember correctly you get 4 and they are definitely worth trying.   Pepper Shrimp: I would consider myself a pepper shrimp connoisseur, so I was excited to try this. Is this great tasting, large, fresh shrimp? Yes! Tasted like well flavoured garlic shrimp to me. Is this the best pepper shrimp I've had? Not quite -- it was missing the spice. Maybe to appeal to a wider audience, but I feel the disclaimer on how spicy it is is inherent in the name.  Jerk Chicken: The modern bbq or \"drum\" is the more convenient and efficient way to cook jerk chicken, but nothing beats the taste of well marinated jerk chicken cooked over different kinds of wood. This is what Chubby does, and they do it well. Really great smokey, spicy flavour, the chicken is nice and moist, and it is not drenched in sauce (which jerk chicken shouldn't be).   Oxtail:  If you've never had it, try it. If you have, you will be happy with this rendition. It's not fatty, it's soft, there is lots of meat on the bones, and the flavour is there. Well balanced between savory and a little sweet.   Jerk Shrimp:  This was my main dish, and it was fantastic. Large shrimp, with that great smokey jerk flavour. It is served with coleslaw, which is also fresh and nice; you can tell it's made in-house. Great portion size for one person.   Rice and peas: Good flavour. Solid side if you want rice with your meal. The rice is basmati rice, which is not traditional, but it was a nice twist. I personally love basmati rice, but for the purists out there -- no, this is not your Grandma's rice and peas. It's good though, and a great portion to share.   Hot Sauce:  I really wanted to like this, but this was the only thing that fell a little flat to me. They have two kinds of house made hot sauces: mango and scotch bonnet. Neither was spicy and the scotch bonnet had a very heavy vinegar taste. Probably just needs a little tweaking of the recipe. Not a deal breaker; I'll re-evaluate the next time I'm there.   DRINKS:  We all had the in-house rum punch. Taste was great and most importantly, it was strong! I would definitely order this again.   SERVICE: It was great! No complaints. From the person who took my reservation, to the waiters, to the front desk, everyone was lovely! Definitely a great experience for celebrating my birthday.   ATMOSPHERE: Beautiful, Caribbean, upscale vibes. They played great old school reggae in the background, the tables, chairs, the decorations, the candle lighting...everything was beautiful.   My profile picture is from my time at Chubby's. I think that best describes the warm and happy feeling you'll get from eating here :).   FINAL THOUGHTS: I'm so glad that a place like Chubby's exists. I echo the sentiments of other Yelp reviewers that it is really nice to have an upscale restaurant where you can bring your friends and family for a nice Jamaican meal.  If you love good food and island vibes, check out Chubby's! :)"}
{"text":"Not easy to find, but was glad I did! A warm welcome awaited me inside and our table was ready early. Perfect! Lighting is low, but the ambience is tropical. Great decor!  I had already scoped out the menu online and had a few questions. Our server answered all of our questions making our selections easy. I had the Caribbean Veggie Stew with a side of Fried Plantains. That stew was fantastic. Mixed it in with the jasmine rice and I was stuffed! The sweet potato, Jamaican pumpkin with coconut milk made this a rich dish. Hearty! I didn't NEED the plantains, but they were pretty good. A little under cooked, but still tasty.   Let's talk about the Rum Punch. Wow. It tasted like bad decisions. It was stronger than expected, but sweet. It was a sipper, but that's coming from someone that drinks beer.  All in all, a delicious evening!"}
{"text":"The Watercress and Papaya Salad with jerk chicken (quarter piece) was probably one of the best things I've ever ate in my entire life.   And that is a bold statement.   Their spicy red sauce was so good. I would buy their spicy red sauce and eat that with everything. Everything on that plate was DELICIOUS.   Honestly, the food was amazing. I was super full and the prices weren't too steep either. The jerk chicken was so moist and juicy, and the watercress and papaya salad was PERFECT and SO FRESH. I've never had such a good salad. It was sweet from the papaya, crunchy from the cashews, and it had nice avocado crema thing going on. Watercress is another one of my favorite ingredients, so I thought the combination of everything was just spectacular.   If you live in Toronto, YOU MUST drop by here.   Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen was entertaining, it was bright, and it was loud. But it was also packed.   PACKED.   Honestly, I cannot believe my friends and I waited 2.5 HOURS for a table here.   SERIOUSLY??   Because we are geniuses, we did not make a reservation on a Saturday night. When we got there at 7, the hostess put us on the waitlist. She said it would take about 45 minutes to an hour. We expected this, so we just wandered around the area and came back a little bit after 8. The hostess then told us we would get our table in 4 MINUTES.   4 minutes past, and then suddenly we were standing there for 30 minutes. We approached the hostess again, and she said that it would be another HOUR. I proceeded to ask why/what changed, and she said that the reservations took priority? What does that even mean??? At this point, my friends and I dipped and we tried finding another restaurant around the area, but everywhere was full and had about an hour wait time!! I've never experienced this in my entire life!! We eventually wandered back to Chubby's around 8:45 - 9 and they told us that again, we were next in the waitlist and there would be about 30 more minutes of waiting.   I honestly have no idea and no clue how and why we didn't get seated after the first one hour wait. It seemed that everyone who went into the restaurant got a seat, and my friends and I were just forgotten about! There was also an upstairs!! What the hell? I don't understand. Seriously, I didn't see ANYONE wait longer than 30 minutes. Groups came in and went, so, I have no idea what happened. I am really skeptical that we legitimately had to wait ALMOST THREE HOURS to get a table. I don't think any other group would have been as patient as us.   We eventually did sit down around 9:30 and started eating around 10.   For dessert, my friends and I shared the cream pie, so that was pretty good too.   I just can't believe we waited that long.... and no one there seemed to appreciate us waiting for 2.5 hours to try out their food.. so I'm thinking, does this place REALLY deserve 4 stars???? Do they value their customers at all?    If you guys ever watched the You're Not Yelping South Park episode, I almost really wanted to pull out the \"And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?\" LOL   TLDR; Make reservations or else you will wait a loOOOOOOng time and cannot eat their amazing food. Still wondering if the restaurant completely lacks care for their customers or if we were just really the unlucky ones."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, as I heard absolutely wonderful things. Came here after a birthday on Sunday, and they were able to seat our party of 9 very quickly upstairs by the bar. As a few tables cleared out, we were able to move, which helped talking and sharing. We started with the patties, and I have to say the turkey curry patties were so flavorful and savoury. The coconut ones were nice too, but it didn't wow me. I dipped my patties in their hot sauce, which doesn't pack a lot of heat, but the taste is still great. For my main, I ordered the jerk chicken with a side of rice and peas, and extra oxtail gravy. I have to say this was very underwhelming. The chicken was a bit dry, and bland. Thank God for ordering the oxtail gravy on the side, otherwise I would have been extremely disappointed. However even this didn't really taste that authentic, and was missing something. The coleslaw was also kind of meh and, I didn't find that it complimented the chicken very well. I did try some of the fries that had a nice cinnamon taste to it, and I really enjoyed that. For dessert, we ordered a passion fruit cheesecake for the birthday girl, and the rum bread pudding. The cheesecake was too tarte for my liking, but that bread pudding was the highlight of the meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and the warmth and soft, yet slightly dense texture made this a joy to eat. Price was pretty on par for king west, and service was honestly great. Such a nice atmosphere, kind of like Planta. I'm not sure I'd I'd be rushing to return, however."}
{"text":"So I honestly picked this restaurant cause of their neon sign and white paint, it stood out to me and reminded me of a warm tropical place because that nite was so cold. I stepped inside and was greeted immediately and knew I made the right choice. Just great energy  all around. The interior is large and spacious but also gave you that intimate feeling. Loved the music selection and yes I was singing along with my food. Their food is delicious,  great portion sizes and arrived in a timely manner. I ordered an appetizer and a main.   I will definitely be back again  and I can't wait . Thank you Chubby's for providing an great  jamaican cusine experience."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Server was great, drinks were awesome and food was tasty! The okra was amazing and I would highly recommend! The rum raisin bread is great too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Jamaican food.  Got chicken wings to start with. Good amount for 2 people. Tasted really good. Was sweet and hot.  After had quarter jerk chicken and some shrimp wrap. Both were fantastic dishes. Vibe was great. Felt like I was out of town. Great spot. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING....  This gem is what I have craved in ages, a mixture of fun, trendy atmosphere with the best Jamaican food around. Friendly staff and had the pleasure of being served by the 2 Jessica's who were both fun, great knowledge of menu and professional. The decor is originals and takes me back to the 8 times I have been to Jamaica. Music and drink choices make the atmosphere.  I went with a group of 4 hungry men and we just kept ordering everything on the menu. Jerk Chicken, ox tail, mini patties , jerk wings are a few of my top choices. I will be back and back and back."}
{"text":"I came to Chubby's with my husband on a Thursday for lunch. Chubby's is my first time take on Jamaican food so I will not be hard on the food but I am told Jamaican food (esp. Jerk chicken) is supposed to blow ones mind. Well I was a bit underwhelmed at Chubby's 1) Restaurant Setting is awesome 2) wait staff are friendly  3) Food: 3 items on the menu turned out to be not offered that day when we started ordering (we weren't told in advance) I kept jumping from one item to the next to which I got an OOPS we don't have that dish today. My husband ordered half a jerk chicken and I ordered fish with coconut shavings and salted fish fritters for appetizers. The fritters were ok but not as good as their price claims to be. The quantities were on the small side. The jerk chicken in my opinion was not properly marinated, I cook a lot and sometimes fall short on marinating my food and I always can tell when I did it properly and when I didn't. The fish was great and very unique in flavor but also the price doesn't justify the portions served. I give it 3/5!"}
{"text":"I had an interview today and, what a place.  I was focused on what I saw-amazing people who enjoy their jobs, polite, and, professional mannered. I am hoping to be a future chef with the best Andrea and, his team of fine empressarios or as I would term them \"creative artists in fine dining.\""}
{"text":"Chubby's is must do for people who love Jamaican/West Indian food!   As a fellow West Indian (Trini), I am more than pleased to have a caribbean restaurant in the city that I feel proud to take my Canadian friends to... to introduce them to our food and our culture. It's nicely done with a cool relaxed vibe, that's classy but not pretentious.  The food itself is a gastronomic delight! The fried Okra; Pepper Shrimp; Salt Fish Balls and jerk style chips were all amazing... I've never had fried Okra done that way and it's now one of my favourites!  I had the Jerk Pork for my main and Wow... it was flavourful and tender and succulent... By far the best I've had in Toronto. I also sampled the Oxtail from my friend's plate and without a doubt the best stew oxtail I've ever had in my life!  The drinks were also really good. We had the Buffalo Soldier (my new favourite drink) and the rum punch (also very good)...  The staff and service was top notch (maybe a little too doting)... but certainly a better alternative than bad service :)  The only downside to the experience was the bread pudding... It came nicely presented like all the food, but I found the bread hard... this took away from the flavour... now maybe this is a Jamaican thing... but I hope it's Chubby's thing and they can fix it.   That said... all in all... Thanks Gusto 54 group for bringing Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen to our fair city! You've proven that you don't need to go to a hole in the wall to get great West Indian (Jamaican) food!  Well done and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The service was spectacular, and the food was incredible. Whenever I'm back in the city I'll be sure to visit"}
{"text":"I came here with a girl friend who was Jamaican. Despite the horrible articles I read about the owner, and cultural appropriation, We wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt.   It was a busy night we were treated at the door by a person of colour, but not Jamaican. We waited 15 mins for our table. Hostess was friendly. Servers felt new but friendly overall.   The menu has some Jamaican ingredients and is created by Gusto group chef Elio (not Jamaican  guy). It seems very Canadianized, crudités, lettuce wraps and ice cream sundaes.   We ordered the jerk chicken, they prized themselves for wood fire. It's not pimento wood and the result is dry, bitter, blackened chicken. My friend had the pork, it was too pink for my taste but she didn't enjoy the dryness of it either.   The patties were dry, thick crust and small but pricey. Can find better in Kensington Market.   The Okra was very nice. But they didn't do anything to it except grilled it. Not very Caribbean tasting.   Lastly the fritters were ok but the sweet mango sauce was too sweet it did not go well together.   The cocktail drinks were fancy, pretty and not Jamaican at all. Stick to red stripe.   I felt very embarrassed for the people who work here. They are oblivious to the cultural appropriation that is happening with this restaurant. They are bastardizing the history and respect for the Jamaican people and all that they have been through. I especially urge the people of colour who work here to wake up! This restaurant fronts 2, I say only 2 black people to the media. They hire a place holder Chef Donovan for all the photos bc he's Jamaican. And they use project leader woman to do Media/social media bc she is of colour and knows how to speak better on behalf of Janet.   Yes a white person can make Jamaican food or Indian person can make a burrito or a Chinese person can make sushi. But when you hire Black skinned people as place holders to \"look\" Jamaican it's gone too far."}
{"text":"The best part is the décor - very warm and inviting. In a city that offers so many authentic Jamaican Jerk spots this place is definitely a miss.   The homemade gingerbeer just tasted like boiled ginger , none of the traditional fermented fizz.   All the \" hot sauces \" were about as spicy as ketchup and the doubles dip came with an odd assortment greens that we wernt sure if they were for dipping or or garnish ( the dips themselves were pretty unremarkable. )   The jerk chicken was dry and came with no gravy or rice and peas. We added a side of rice and peas and it had no flavour and was dry.   The chicken curry was tasty but lacked salt.   Going forward I'll stick to island foods for my Jamaican cravings ."}
{"text":"My friend (hi David!) chose this place so that we could eat some delicious Caribbean food. And our goal was definitely complete! I was torn between the jerk wings, jerk chicken, curry chicken, jerk pork and chubby burger. I ended up getting the chubby burger after seeing how small the other portions were. Some of the dishes also did not come with rice and you have to order it as a side dish which will cost you $5-6 extra. Would I buy a bowl of jasmine white rice for $5? No, but I appreciate they have the option for those side dishes.  I got the chubby burger and got to tried some of the patties. For the chubby burger, it was a great deal with a decent size of fresh-cut fries, this light sauce that really complimented the fries, a smaller side of coleslaw (that had a little kick), and the burger which had jerk seasoning. Okay, the seasoning wasn't something I was familiar but it was so good with the different layers of the burger (I saw something like relish, the sauce). For the patties, the curry turkey was on point and tastes exactly what it's meant to taste like. The coconut one however, I couldn't taste at all.  Overall, I knew that Chubby's really does care about their food quality AND experience. Our direct line of contact through the whole experience was the bartender who took our orders, checked up on us, and gave us our bills. Despite being busy making drinks, he didn't hesitate to check up on us and refill our drinks. I honestly appreciated that service a lot. Chubby's noise level is definitely higher than your average restaurant's but it's because everyone's having a good time! If you don't like it, order takeout and enjoy it in quiet but the atmosphere definitely adds to the experience. Props to the staff too for keeping everything organized with the layout of the shop and the tightness of space.  A bonus: you know the washrooms are fancy when you have trouble turning on the faucets."}
{"text":"Loved the decor, delicious food and cocktails too. Awesome music. There was a 30 minute wait for our table but we were happy to have drinks and apps at the bar while we waited. Friendly service. Loved the diversity of the staff. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Chubby's should really have 5 stars...blame it on the server Danielle who brought our experience from a 5star to a 2!  The food was spectacular, the jerked wings perfection, curry chicken perfectly Seasoned, rice was a bit over cooked but pineapple salsa was delish. Wasn't a fan of the plaintains... they needed to be a bite more rip for my liking and the cut was too thin so there's improvement to be made there.   The drinks well...I had the cocktail in a pineapple...don't be shocked when the bill comes and you realize that you just paid 21.00 to have six sips and almost got your eye taken out by a leave...I kindly asked the waitress if I could have the drink transferred into a glass sparing her of my explanation and was punished...8 to 10 minutes later my cocktail reappeared but not without a snarl and an attitude. The only time I got a smile was when the bill came. This review should not reflect the amazing hostess who greater us with open arms but Danielle needs to readjust her attitude ... thumbs down to service and what could have been a 5 star rating for Chubby's."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not one I had checked out on Yelp prior to my arrival. I had gotten a haircut earlier in the day and the hair stylist mentioned this new restaurant was next on her list.  Recently I saw a travel show which featured the Jerk Chicken being cooked. So when I saw it on their menu, there was no doubt in my mind where I was dining and what I would dine on.  When I got there, there was a line just out the door. The couple ahead of me was told of a half hour wait for a table, so I told the hostess that I would like it to sit at the bar. Since the downstairs bar was packed, she mentioned another bar upstairs which appeared to slightly bigger.  While waiting for the bartender to take my beverage order, I observed her making an interesting drink and ordered it, the Hibiscus Mojito. It was one of two cocktails I observed being made frequently that evening. The other being the Everything Nice.  I knew before I walked inside that I would get the Jerk Chicken. The bartender told me the half chicken would be appropriate for someone with moderate hunger. When the food arrived, she had provided bottles of mango chutney and papaya chutney in case the food was not appropriately spicy. Since no one on that travel show added any type of chutney on their jerk chicken, I decided not to put any on mine. The chicken had plenty of spices to be flavorful, so I saw no need to make it spicy hot.  Before I ate the chicken, I had a few bites of Chubby's Slaw, the default side. Unfortunately, I was not too excited by its taste. Rather than risk spoiling my appetite, I decided I would eat the cole slaw later. By the time I finished the chicken, I had no desire to eat any more.  None of the dessert choices seemed appealing. So, I asked the bartender to suggest a cocktail. I was amused when she brought out the Everything Nice. I saw the drink being made several times during the night and considered ordering one for myself."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Ambience legit and food is even better. I had the jerk wings and immediately wanted to know who was back there cooking. Then had the curried goat and sampled other entrees and I didn't taste anything that I wouldn't rate 5 stars. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Tried Chubby's for Mother's day yesterday and was unbelievably impressed with the food, quick service, atmosphere and vibes.  Can't say enough good things about the place, every dish we had was fantastic.  Our order included the jerk pork, festival, plantains, patties and jerk tempeh.  Also had their version of a mojito (with sorrel) which was sooooo delicious.  Then came dessert and we were blown away.  If you get a chance to try this place out give it a shot, pretty good fusion menu of jamaican favourites a with a slight north american twist (but not too much)!  One reason i didn't give it 5 stars is it's not fully accessible as you can only access the second floor via stairs...."}
{"text":"Great service, super cute space, the food (especially the jerk) was very well-done. Absolutely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wow!! No words can describe how amazing this was.  I have been visiting Toronto for business for the last three years and have eaten at at least 30+ restaurants in the Toronto area and I have always found, up until now, the food was pretty bland in Canada.  Perhaps this is because my American palette is use to over salted and over seasoned flavors but this place was amazing!!  Now the price to performance isn't the best since I think for 20 cad I would have still been hungry but as far as flavor I'm concerned, the jerk chicken was bang on.  And if the spice level is not enough for you, you can always ask for a side of their jerk marinade which brings the full force of heat and smoke to bear.  Besides the jerk chicken I also tried the oxtail stew which I thought was pretty good but next to the jerk chicken there is no comparison.  Run don't walk to Chubby's!!!   Ps get the okra as a side!!! It will change your life."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here! The décor is so cute (very Insta worthy) We sat upstairs at the bar and drank Hibiscus Mojitos which were unreal. The jerk wings were great, but the pepper shrimp and the burger were just okay. I'll be back though!"}
{"text":"Love love love! The atmosphere, the vibe, the workers, the food! Everything about this place is simply amazing! Our waiter James was so helpful when we asked for recommendations of certain things on the menu. The jerk wings, oxtails and goat were soo good.  If I lived in Toronto I would be here every week."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place! Amazing with great ambience. Would recommend in ordering the chicken wings and kale salad. Their drinks are really good as well. I wish their patties were bigger vs smaller test sizes. Would recommend to come back again"}
{"text":"Food & Cocktail are GREAT and the atmosphere too, a bit small inside and too spicy though"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night after a recommendation from some friends. The venue is trendy with good lighting, and the washrooms were also very clean, which our party noted and appreciated. We had Jess W. as our server and she was top notch from beginning to end - personable, attentive, funny, and accurate - which is a rarity these days. Request her before you visit, if possible, and you, too, will see what we're talking about :) Now onto the food. Overall, it was very, very good. We started with festival and okra, and both were delectable- crispy and not greasy. Our mains included the curried goat, a half jerk chicken, and the veggie stew. Again, mains were good portions, served piping hot and tasting very fresh. West Indian food has a reputation for being heavy and laden with oil, but I can say with confidence that Chubbys food was neither. The curried goat gravy was clean, the veggies stews were creamy and plentiful, and the jerk chicken was the real deal. Make sure you check out the jerk pit they have in the back. You also must try the rum and raisin bread pudding for dessert! You will not be disappointed. All in all, our only complaints were the $20 we paid for parking and we found the music was a bit loud. However, we would definitely go back. Chubby's, please don't lower your standards... you are a gem among the Jamaican restaurant wannabes!!"}
{"text":"Chubby's is the new upscale Jamaican restaurant at Adelaide and Portland. I went there for a dinner with a friend.  The first thing I noticed was how... nice it was inside. My parents live in a Caribbean neighbourhood (Eg West) so I've been to my fair share of Jamaican restaurants, but nothing as nice as this. The restaurant is very tastefully decorated with soft music and candle light. The wait staff is very friendly and professional, and are quick to recommend their favourites. I wouldn't think twice about taking a date here, which is something I can't say for 99% of Jamaican joints in the city.  The food is great! However, the portions leave a lot to be desired especially for the price that you're going to pay. I shared an order of the curry chicken, the jerk pork, a side of jasmine rice, and an order of the Jamaican beef patties. Try the jerk pork at the very least! It's super flavourful and crispy. The order for us came up to about $32 per person, and neither of us felt really satisfied leaving the restaurant.  I wouldn't say that the food is very authentic, but I can see myself coming back here someday."}
{"text":"For the food I give it a 3.5 for the atmosphere I give it a 4.5  I love the fact that this is a Jamaican restaurants with a modern and decor yet you still get the island vibe as well as a very great selection of music from Dancehall afrobeats reggae  I ordered the pepper shrimp to start and the half jerk chicken and the half a pound of jerk pork for my meal I misunderstood when I ordered the jerk chicken and the jerk pork I thought they were meals but all the sides are sold separately so for me that is quite pricey because the half a pound of jerk pork is $17 and then for Rice it's an extra $6 same thing with c jerk chicken the half a chicken was $19 it came with coleslaw but if you wanted rice that was extra  Taste-wise the pepper shrimp was full of flavor it was spicy enough where you felt your mouth tingling but your nose wasn't running so I was extremely happy the jerk pork to me was not jerk pork it was more grilled pork The Jerk flavoring was not there for me the jerk chicken wasn't too bad but it was a little dry the white meat I think it is more of a North American Jamaican rather than authentic Jamaican jerk  For drinks I got the gin and ting which was really good I love it no complaints there my friend got the Mojito which did not taste like a mojito the men's wasn't that strong but the alcohol in the drink was  Overall I would go back because the pepper shrimp was really good and the atmosphere was nice I would not order the jerk again I would probably stick to getting more appetizers or maybe try the curry"}
{"text":"We were excited to read about Chubby's in the latest Toronto Life issue and since my wife is Jamaican, we are always looking for that high end Jamaican restaurant.     The ambience and wait staff were very good so our expectations were high.  The turkey curry patties were ok but the pastry was wrong, too crisp and baked a little too long instead of being flaky, the filling a little dry. My curry chicken was over seasoned so I was not able to enjoy the curry flavours.  My wife's curry goat was ... oxtail.  The chef insisted that it was curry goat that had simply been reduced resulting in a very dark color .... but you cannot mistake large chunks of oxtail vertebrae as any part of a goat.  The chef was right though, it had been reduced so much that there was a bitter and burnt aftertaste to the gravy.  Which made dunking the festival in them not as enjoyable as it should've been, the festival themselves were very dense (not airy) and hence hard to chew.  The Chubby Slaw was lacking in acidity and while looking great just didn't have that refreshing taste.  We tried to redeem the lunch with desert ... and it was the best part.  My sundae was intricate and tasty but not sure if the flavours work together.  My wife had the carrot sponge cake but she said it didn't taste like a carrot cake.  I don't want to trash the place because it could have simply been an off day.  But I see all these 4-5 star reviews and I wonder how could my perception be so different."}
{"text":"The venue was nice and our waitress was very helpful. Usually caribbean restaurants are more for takeout but this one was so beautifully decorated with lots of space & good music. The menu offered lots of traditional jamaican staples (festivals, jerk chicken, oxtail) while still having a modern flair to it. I cant wait to go back to Toronto so i can go there again .  Decor 4/5 Vibe 5/5 Food 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Don't let the outside appearance fool you. Amazing interior decoration. Staff are very friendly. Pattie is a must. Jerk wing, chicken and pork are to die for. Ox tail stew is so tender. Most of all, drink are fabulous and not short off alchohol.  Definitely on my favour dining list."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  Great-tasting food.  Ambiance is nice (They could get rid of a few tables so people are not packed in, however.)."}
{"text":"Went one week after opening. Yes to good-to-very good food. No to service. Big no. Reasons: 8 people, we ordered a ton of food, and were hoping it would be paced. Within 20 minutes, every single dish was piled on the table with no logic sense or timing, even better the drinks did not come to the table until 20 minutes after the food arrived. The food was outstanding, but they did not have the mechanisms and timing between kitchen and bar down. Hopefully, by fixing that, they can compete with much more consistent environments like Patois. Good job, not great job. Will return and hopefully will add a star."}
{"text":"Most Caribbean restaurants in Toronto, and other cities I've been to, cater mostly to a takeout crowd. Having a proper sit-down Jamaican restaurant is a big deal, at least to Jamaicans. Or maybe just me. Chubby's has done a geat job in putting this place together, elevating Jamaican food to a whole new level and audience.  From the outside, it's a plain white house with a simple neon sign over the front door. Stepping inside revealed the WOW factor. The decor is so tastefully upscale in a manner that reminds me of a plantation style resort in Jamaica - the rich rustic woods, furniture, murals, lighting fixtures, and more. It's a beautiful space!  The menu is a reflection of Chef Donavon's Jamaican heritage and includes staples such as Curry Chicken, Curry Goat, Oxtail, Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Rice & Peas, and more. There are also \"Likkle Bites\" and modernized versions of classic Jamaican dishes - Saltfish Fritters (mango-lime-papaya salsa), Double Dip (ackee and lentil dips, micro vegetables, jerk spice dusted chips), Ackee and Saltfish Bites (sweet peppers, onions, tomatoes, fried dumplings), and other creations.  My friend and I started off with the Spicy Jerk Chips (plantain, taro, jerk spice dust) and Slow-Baked Jerk Wings (wild honey, scotch bonnet dust, lime zest festival). The plantain and taro chips were sliced paper thin and were ultra crispy and tasty with the jerk spices. The wings were perfectly spiced and cooked and the serving was enough for up to four people as an appetizer. The delicious little festivals are not to be forgotten. Yummy!  For our main course, we ordered Curry Goat and Oxtail. The meats and rice arrived in separate bowls, perfect for sharing. Both dishes were cooked really well and were rich in flavour. The meats were tender and the gravies had the right consistency to stick to the rice.  To finish, we shared a Rum & Raisin Bread Pudding with warm caramel sauce and vanilla bean gelato. Perfection! I won't be sharing this next time.  I almost forgot about the house-made hot sauces that were brought to the table with our meal. If I recall, one had papaya and the other, passion fruit. My memory may be wrong but they were both very good.  My dining companion for the evening, a Jamaican chef who has cooked for US Presidents and Royalty, was as impressed as I was with the overall experience. As mentioned earlier, to me, this place has the feel of a resort, so does the food, a very good resort! They've done a lot of things right and I wish them lots of success. I'll definitely be back!  Disclosure: Donavon Campbell, Chef de Cuisine at Chubby's, and I worked together at a golf/banquet facility years ago where he was the Executive Chef. If this review seems biased, it's not because of my relationship with him, it's because I'm a Jamaican who loves good Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had a great experience here. I had the Jerk Chicken, shared a veggie stew, and had the (excellent) rum punch.  Everything was on brand and delicious (my eyes rolled back in delight on the first bite of the chicken). We sat at the bar, so the bar tenderer looked after us, and she was really friendly and attentive. I  will be back"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance this place has, very warm and welcoming. The service was on point as was the food, I personally had the Crudité plate and a slice of carrot cake both were filled with flavour. I also tasted someones Jerk Chicken and that was amazing, so much so I tried to get the spices they used from the staff but they said it was an in-house blend done by one of their chefs and top secret. Lastly, also sampled the Coconut Cream pie which was very very good and that's an easy one to mess up.   Was a great place to go with a group, the warmth of the restaurant radiated through the interior decor, staff and music and would be a great place to go for a night out with your significant other as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A fabulous experience..for apps..if you like spicy try the pepper shrimps.. comes with in house baked hardo bread..so good. The oxtail is a must, the deserts..so hard to choose..all delicious, I love the rum and raisin bread pudding. The Cocktails are creative,  you cannot go wrong with the rum punch. Service is friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Loved their jerk chicken! Also to die for were the wings and patties. Liked the veggie patties best. Full of flavor and had great crisp."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe and decor. Good cocktail. Service was excellent. Food needs more work and that's why 4 stars.   Had the chips, jerk shrimp, goat curry and very bad patties."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is great from the decor to the music to the super friendly servers.   They have great homemade hot sauce.  Loved the curried goat and the two kinds of patties. I went twice in two weeks I liked it so much.   I want to go back with more than just one person so I can try more of the menu next time."}
{"text":"Awesome little tucked away gem.  They literally turned a normal house into a chic Jamaican cuisine!  Try the rum punch and the jerk chicken wings. The servers and staff are dressed in relaxed Caribbean attire. Super friendly and professional. The Jamaican mule is awesome!"}
{"text":"TBH more of a 3.5 stars  Yesterday a group of my friends and I checked out Chubby's and were surprised to see how packed it was on a Thursday night. Good thing we were a small group so less than 10 min we quickly got a seat, service was really quick and friendly  The decor here is so cute and tropical with the palm trees wallpaper and Pastel bar area. Very Instagram worthy IMO. Also loved the music here  Food wise it's quite good too, we were quickly drawn towards the jerk chicken as they are an Jamaican restaurant. The chicken flavour wise was ok, meat wise it was nice and tender and juicy. The slaw that came with the chicken was disappointing though, the texture was a little too chopped up almost mushy- flavour was bland too. Portion wise perfect for 2 people   The app we chose was the spicy chips, loved the flavour and textures, we had plantains and Taro chips super flavourful, thin and crispy  Finally the dessert we chose was the Passionfruit Coconut Crème Pie  so good, the Crème wasn't sweet at all which contrasted beautiful with the toffee like coconut biscuit. The custard had a strong Passionfruit which made me really happy bc I've had really weak flavoured ones before. Will definitely go back for dessert in the future . . ."}
{"text":"I am Jamaican but this place is not. They are trying too hard to be Jamaican they are forgetting the flavour of the food. This place would not be in Jamaica. Bootleg Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Beware when ordering through uber eats. Ordered a watercress and papaya salad and added a jerk chicken breast to it with a side of slaw. Not cheap. Came up to $38 (mind you all the delivery fees). However, I didn't get my chicken!  So I paid $38 for a salad and slaw. Was really looking forward to trying this place out but am very disappointed"}
{"text":"I think this is the first official \"home style restaurant\" for a Jamaican cuisine. There's a lot of places you can get Jamaican and \"carribean\" fast food... but getting to the point it was refreshing to finally see a real restaurant place like this pop up!   I popped in quickly late lunch at the bar and the bartender gave me a nice sample of the house rum drink she was making fresh. It was nice!  The food arrived quite timely as I ordered the half jerk chicken with callaloo instead of slaw.   Red stripe beer refreshed my memory of the amazing times I've had in Jamaica for the few visits I've made. Overall 4* (I'd rate it 5* but this is not a white cloth fine dining/service place)"}
{"text":"Cute interior setup like a house. We sat at the bar at the top most level and were delighted to discover a skylight in the roof.   Cocktail: Kingston 10. Tequila based. Tasted like skittles, in a good way.  Mains: goat curry and half a jerk chicken. The jerk chicken apparently takes longer to prepare but it came out first. It was pretty good with a decent side of slaw.  The goat curry was rich and had nice heat to it without being too hot to enjoy. Came with a nice mango chutney and rice. The 2 mains were probably a bit too much food for one person but just 1 main would not have been enough. A main + starter should suffice.  We went in with the mistaken perception that it's a quick-service place. (Just assumed). But takes as long as any another dine-in place. Maybe  90 minutes for the meal. But time flew as we were admiring the decor. Good service. Very present."}
{"text":"LMAO please stop calling this jamaican food. It's subtle in taste at best. Another gentrification. Enjoy though."}
{"text":"I love Jamaican food and I was not expecting to be eating so much Jamaican food this trip back to Toronto, but I was so lucky!  We got ackee and saltfish bites, oxtail stew, jerk pork, Caribbean veggie stew, and a sundae dessert. The food is not mindblowing, but they are pretty on point.   My chief complaint there is how dark the place is. We had to take out our phones and turn on the flashlight to read the menu.   To be fair, i am not used to eating Jamaican food in a fancy restaurant. I mean, the Calabash Bay cocktail served in a pineapple was $21 - I ordered it not knowing that a drink can be that expensive! But the food there is good and if you want jamaican food not from a hole in the wall, but a fancy restaurant around King with great ambiance and cocktail, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is fun. First off the decor and ambiance is great. We ordered the patties, Ackerman salt fish bites and the wings. Omg the wings were amazing. The great thing is the plates are shareable and good value since you get quite full (the portions are a good amount). The patties were kinda bland, the pastry isn't super flaky or crisp and the fillings were okay.   Defs would go here again with friends or a great date spot."}
{"text":"Finally checked out Chubby's on NYE!  The space is super cute and full of island vibes.  Loved the decor, ambiance and music here! The place is bigger than expected with an upstairs portion of the restaurant as well.  The cocktail list is long and creative.  I ended up trying the Rum Punch which was tasty but I could've used a bit more rum in it haha.  I also tried the Jamaican Mule which was interesting if you're into ginger beer.  As for food, there is a great selection of mains and appetizers. A lot of the menu items are familiar to me as I grew up eating Caribbean food so I was interested to see their take on it.  I ordered the quarter jerk chicken with slaw and a side of fried plantains.  The chicken was decent, not as spicy as it should be though.  The slaw was generic, uneventful.  The fried plantains were alright as well.  I asked for hot sauce on the side and she brought three different types.  The one claimed to be the hottest was not even that hot.  Overall it was still a good meal but maybe I am just so accustom to more authentic Jamaican food that I found it all to be very mediocre.  As for dessert, I had the carrot coconut sponge cake thing and it was delicious! Can't go wrong with dessert ;)"}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...  \"Our server, Jahmal, greeted us like we were old pals. He was extremely knowledgeable and attentive without making us feel rushed. After all, we were on island time, mais oui? What I loved most was his melodic voice and rhythmic movements from table to table. He lifted our spirits and helped transport us to the Caribbean, if only for a few hours.   From the \"Likkle Bites\" section of the menu, my guest and I shared the Jamaican patties ($10). The generous portion of four patties were encased in sunshine yellow pastry--a perfectly flaky texture that needed no improvement. Biting into the patty was an out-of-this world experience. It split into layers, revealing the perfectly puréed filling of curry turkey and coconut greens. A combination of Allspice and chopped Scotch bonnet peppers punched up the flavour profile, and a splash of vinegar tempered the fattiness. House made sauces were the perfect pairings, but could have used more fire.\""}
{"text":"A-MEI-ZING Caribbean comfort food. I took my partner here for a birthday treat and oh man they somehow manage to mix the perfect combination of homey Carribean food and vibe but somehow give it a fancy vibe to it without losing the authenticity.   Food: We got the patties (HIGHLY recommend) and ox tail stew (which was the best dish there) and also jerk chicken (which was probably the most average dish). The drinks thouggggghhh, were ON POINT. We also got their rum dessert which was quite unique but not sure if it's worth the price!   Decor: This place IS A VIBE!!! They have a classy cool downstairs section and an amazing natural lighting upstairs section.   Would highly recommend as a date spot or a friends birthday party!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy jerk chips, Caribbean veggie stew, and jerk chicken. They were all so delicious! Loved Chubby's atmosphere and how attentive and down-to-earth the staff were as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is officially one of my fave restaurants in Toronto. Here's why:  1. Everything tasted amazing. We ordered the watercress/papaya salad, which had cashews and an avocado cream base. The jerk pork was to die for. Seriously get it. Even the simple cooked vegetables in the jerk pork tasted amazing! Lastly, we ordered fried plantains, because that's a classic. It was cooked perfectly and so so sweet.   2. It's surprisingly healthy! I'm not on a strict paleo diet but honestly I love eating vegetables and meat. All I ate here was vegetables and meat, and it was amazing! I'm glad the jerk chicken/pork doesn't come with rice - you can order the carbs on the side.   3. Service and atmosphere was fun, friendly, and quick! We didn't wait long even though we came on a Friday night (we sat at the bar), and our first dish was served like 5 minutes after we ordered it. They have really upbeat music playing as well.   I'm totally coming back here to try the jerk chicken, patties, oxtail stew, and the kale salad!"}
{"text":"Its fine and a nice interesting change in the neighbourhood. The interior is cool and they did a great job renovating. Food wise I wasnt impressed. The oxtail stew was over seasoned by a lot. The jerk pork was just OK. Maybe my expectations were to the level of the food we had in Jamaica but this wasnt that."}
