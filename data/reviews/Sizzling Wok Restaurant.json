{"text":"By far the worst restaurant experience I've had in my entire life - I urge you not to eat here. My family & I had eaten here at least 5 times before, never with a problem. When we went yesterday, they were understaffed with 2 polite & apologetic employees. We were very understanding & patient as we waited for our food & we had no problems with the 2 employees, who were very pleasant.  Our food took a little long, but we were fine with that as the staff was apologetic & we sympathized with them. Unfortunately, the Orange Chicken had no chicken inside of it and tasted like a ball of dough...it was disgusting. The Kung Po chicken tasted ok, but it was completly different from when we've ordered it in the past at this restaurant. Then Kenny (the owner) came over to our table, asked what the problem was, picked up a half eaten piece of Orange \"Chicken\" from my 10 year old daughter's plate, popped it in his mouth and said, \"This is chicken!\" as food sprayed from his mouth. He did the same with the Kung Po Chicken, argued for a minute, then said, \" you know what, you're right, my new chef sucks & his food tastes like shit!\"  The whole thing spiraled out of control...he seemed like he might've been drunk. He started to say he was going to fire his chef, he got louder & louder, & said he was going to do us a favor and not charge us. I explained that we didn't want his food, didn't want to come back, and he wasn't doing us a favor by not charging for food we weren't going to eat. Food that, in his own words, \"tasted like shit.\" I also said he should refund us the $17 we spent on the Groupon for his restaurant. Then he got belligerent...he was swearing (shit this & fuck that) in front of my kids (6, 8, & 10) and other customers could not believe what was going on. My wife helped keep me relatively calm as we escorted our children out while he continued to yell profanities at us & recommended we eat at McDonald's. He also made some comment about coming into his restaurant with a groupon - that we shouldn't expect so much when we're not paying full price.  I can not believe what an aweful experience this was and, while I feel pity for Kenny & the pathetic life he must be living, I feel more sorry for his friendly employees who deserve to work somewhere better and for my children who were terrified & in tears."}
{"text":"It is always good to find good food so close to home.  While we do generally cook  throughout the week, weekends are made for lazy chefs.  Our choice at that point (particularly Sundays) is Sizzling Wok.    I have to say, that after having for a few weeks now, the Chicken and Mixed Vegetables in Sesame Sauce, has become a family favorite! I have never been disappointed in any thing you have cooked for my family or me.   Any instance where I have called and been indecisive, when asked to surprise me, you have NEVER missed! That is the sign of an owner that pays attention to his clientele. Bravo, Kenneth Kong! Many more years of service awaits you, great job!  dave"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese food goes this place is surpizingly good! Not as much oil used as a lot of Chinese restaurants use nowdays and the dishes seem to have more veggies, good flavor and generous portions. Try the Mah-la chicken, spicy and oh so good! Mu Shu is always good too. The owner Kenny is a nice guy and appreciates his customers, I get take out here a lot."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great meal. My General Chicken actually looked like chicken breast strips. Husband loved his Crispy Scallion Chicken and Hot and Sour soup. Super friendly staff and hands on owner.He spoke to every customer.A real find in Mint Hill. I always try to support local eateries and recommend Sizzling Wok."}
{"text":"This was probably the weirdest dining experience I've ever had. The staff was unprofessional (one was wearing shorts and flip-flops), and they acted like they'd never worked in a restaurant before. I ordered the crispy scallion chicken and it had a strange taste to it. And don't ask for water to drink, unless you want to drink water that tastes like it came out of the faucet in your bathroom. I am so glad I had a Groupon for this and didn't have to pay full price. I will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a well-reviewed Chinese Restaurant close to home but were disappointed after eating the food.  My 13-month old daughter and I had an upset stomach that night and my dad got sick when he ate it for leftovers.  Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"So my wife and I went to this place after church today around 1:00 PM. There are not many people there and some people are leaving. So we waited until the server/cashier check people out then we was seated. At first hand the resturant seem small and have purple walls. so it was okay. But as I walk to our table the floor is extremely sticky and few of the tables has yet been cleaned. After what I saw in the restroom it literally turn my stomach. The men's restroom are disgusting and smelly. I would rather go to a gas station restroom better then that. But since my wife has a Groupon to go there I reluctantly sit down and order. the food was okay but very small portion for the price. I also carry Togo order for work and it was not that great. the egg roll was filled with a lot of white pepper and the general tso chicken was dry as well as the rice. I told my wife I would not go back to this resturant if they give me a few meal. Nasty place and food is not that great. Be cautious."}
{"text":"Lady at the front was very nice.  We got takeout, which was fast.  The rice was hard and very dark brown and over soy sauced, eggroll was soggy.  Other dishes had no taste.  Something in the air there made us both get a tickle in our throat.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Chinese food. By far the best in mint hill. Everyone there is super nice too. Especially the owner"}
{"text":"This is your standard strip mall chinese restaurant. It's nothing really to write home about unless the owner is working the front of the house in which case he always makes you fell super welcome. The food is on par with other chinese restaurants with maybe a little bit of a edge in that the General Tso's isn't fried and battered to oblivion like most others.   Prices are decent and seating is adequate. We did, however, have the misfortune of being in there when a family of 6 adults and 7 insanely noisy children decided it was time to get out of the house and have some chinese. The staff was overwhelmed and it took a little longer than it should have for the guy, who had to have one of our party help show him how to work the register, check us out.   As for mint hill though this is probably the best chinese restaurant in the game."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place to have a quiet lunch or dinner.  I went because Amazon was offering a voucher for half off.  I had the general chicken with fried rice it was very flavorful, the fried rice was really good.  We have been there three more times and the food is always good, reasonably priced too with decent portions."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Been there twice each time I couldn't finish what I ordered.  Don't waste your money with this place."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food with no MSG. However when I asked for extra broccoli they gave me one piece and then tries to charge me for it. The staff has always been great though. With a nice inside."}
{"text":"I can not believe the experience I had tonight from this establishment. First of all I called and placed my order and was told it would be 45-50 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes later it arrived. The driver did apologize and he was very nice. I had a large order and a house full of people waiting to eat so when the food did come everyone was happy. Until I opened my dumplings which were burnt and my niece opened her combo chicken and broccoli and the rice was all dry and tasted disgusting! I have never had a problem here before and I have ordered from here many times The owner's name is Kenny. They have an auto system that shows your name and address when you call so when I called back Kenny answers the phone and I said yes is this the owner the phone got totally quiet for 30 seconds I kept saying hello then he comes back with this rude attitude and asked me what I wanted when I explained he said oh the manager isn't here let me have him call you back. Um dude I KNOW that's you Kenny. That is some of the biggest BS I have ever heard pretending not to be the owner so you don't have to hear a complaint from a customer you took money from and gave crappy food too unbelievable and unacceptable! People reading this review please take the time to read the \"unpublished\" reviews I wish I had before I ever ordered from this place."}
{"text":"In the past several months service and food quality have suffered. I really hate this has happened to this restaurant. RIP Sizzling Wok."}
{"text":"Had garlic chicken and crab Rangoon. Both very good. Quick Chinese, very friendly service, tasty and not greasy."}
{"text":"Kenny is extremely rude.  I order from here on a weekly basis and every time he asks me not to pay with my credit card because it takes too long.  I'm sorry Kenny this is the 21st century and I don't carry cash.  Tonight when I called and said hold on I need to grab my card (my fault I thought I knew where it was when I dialed) he responded with we are too busy.  You are two busy to take an order and get money??  Then I found it and started to read my card.  When I got to the third set of numbers he said hold on I need to go cook.  Excuse me?  Do not answer the phone if you need to be cooking.  You my friend lack in customer service.  The gentleman he handed the phone to was extremely kind, as all of the other employees are there.  If it had not been for him I would have hung up and taken my business elsewhere.  I think in the future I may do just that.  Kenny if you are going to own a restaurant learn how to treat your customers.  Especially ones that order frequently."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!  The water tasted weird so the owner/manager came out and personally apologized and offered us free sodas...we are usually a carbonated drink-free family but it was awesome that a business owner was so eager to accommodate his customers. We also liked the atmosphere.  It was simple but clean and didn't smell like fried food like what I've experienced in some small restaurants.  We will definitely be returning. They also DELIVER so I know where my family and I will be eating on our lazy days!!"}
{"text":"First of all when I walk into the area I was greeted warmly by the owner. He is kind and humble. The food is delicious. The price for it is good. Love to come here again"}
{"text":"A nice place to order out or sit down and eat. Ive ordered here several times and the food is always good. Very reasonably priced and service is always consistent. They make a very good fried rice and the boneless spare ribs are excellent."}
{"text":"OFF DAY? They were profusely apologetic for the comedy of errors with our order and bill. They were just as apologetic to the other couple - and the people on the phone who were not happy with their delivery. Once the new staff gets trained, hopefully things will be smoother. The food was a tad salty when it finally arrived."}
{"text":"Visiting the area so we decided to give this place a try due to the reviews. The owner was great on the phone and was able to deliver to our hotel. Excellent service and great food!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was about 100 degrees. It was nasty. We had a restaurant.com gift certificate that said nothing about not being valid for lunch. The waiter told me we could not use it for lunch. I showed her the certificate and asked her where it said not valid for lunch. The owner came out & argued with me that the certificate cannot be used for lunch even though it doesn't state that anywhere. He told me that I could cancel the order or we could pay dinner prices & use it. Ridiculous! My kids were starving and against my better judgment, we ordered and said we would just not use it. The waitress then came back & said that they would take it. Either way, the food was not good and I did get sick. The restaurant is not clean & is like an oven. NEVER AGAIN!!! Nightmare!"}
{"text":"First of all, scroll to the bottom of this page and read \"not recommended reviews\". In another words, accurate and more up-to-date ...they will tell you all you need to know.   Then: let me inform anyone whom considers eating there, Ken makes a point to send me private hateful messages on a regular basis, and even his employees despise him.  That says nothing good about his character. This store should close and soon.   Next comes my original review :  Nasty, no one there on a Sunday afternoon and the floors were filthy!!  A rating of 90....duct tape on the seats and they were sticky ugh   Regarding the review above, it's sad to say, but Mr. Ken spends a lot of time bullying those who leave honest reviews,although some of his responses are quite entertaining. I took screenshots and shared them with my friends on social media so that they're aware of his true nature...maybe less time on Yelp and more time cleaning tables and floors would be in order.  As for eating out, negative reviews harm me not at all, only your restaurant   And thanks for deleting your hateful responses to my review   Please read below comment by the owner, how sad that this is the way he chooses to respond.  If I were a P.F. Chang customer, I certainly would have never stopped in to begin with , it was actually because by word of mouth, we heard the food was good. See, word of mouth works both ways. Did I mention you reeked of cigarette smoke?   Too bad Chick-Fil-a isn't open on Sunday, that's the type of place I choose to give my business to.  Have a blessed life."}
{"text":"The worst part of Sizzling Wok is the location.  You have to look hard to find the place.  Hopefully when the new hardware store opens to replace the closed grocery store, it will bring some more customers in, because it would be a real shame if Kenny had to close due to lack of business.  Once you manage to find Sizzling Wok, you will find a gracious, multi-ethnic staff.  I don't usually point this out, but when you go into a Chinese restaurant, you usually see (wait for it) Chinese employees.  Not here.  We were greeted by a female African American, Kenny (who appears to be Chinese) and a gentleman who would be hard-pressed to be more Southern.  Were he a bit older, he could have played in Lynyrd Skynyrd.  That's a tough act to follow in any establishment, let alone an ethnic restaurant.  Luckily it doesn't detract here.  We settled in and decided on the (Flaming) Pu Pu platter for an appetizer, as it would allow us to sample several items that sounded tasty.  All in all, they weren't bad, but the star was the teriyaki beef skewers.  These succulent, tender mounds of meat were music to my mouth.  I am drooling just thinking about them.  Unfortunately, the rest of the platter, while good, didn't quite do as well.  I'd stick to the skewers.  If you don't like beef, the chicken isn't bad, and the wings are pretty good.  Stay away from the fried shrimp - it's pretty bad, with enough bread to scare away the Merita delivery guy (I know - he's my uncle).  By the time we put away the Pu Pu platter, we were bordering on full, both because it was a decent amount of food and because we had been impressed by the way that the staff - all of them - kept our glasses full.  But we forged ahead, into the Sizzling Wok Special (with a little spice).  I'll warn you now, this is not like Panda's Den, where you can tell them to go nuts on the spice and you won't have to worry about what you get.  If you tell Kenny you want a little spice, he'll take care of you.  We needed every drop of the liquid they gave us, and then some.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Unfortunately there aren't many vegetarian options, but there are a couple.  Shame, really, as the food is excellent.  Perhaps some of the best Chinese in Charlotte, and certainly the best in this area of town.  I highly recommend you checking it out, and tell Kenny I said so.  Sweet Tea Report:  Another great surprise is Kenny's sweet tea.  He even suggests that having an item on the menu like sweet tea that isn't sweet enough just doesn't make sense, and that those people who make sweet tea that isn't sweet don't know what they are doing.  Why would someone do such a thing?  Sweet tea and Chinese food?  Interesting combination, but it really works!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Sizzling Wok for years. The food is outstanding (definitely have paid more for less at other Chinese restaurants) and Kenny is a fantastic owner. It's easy to become a regular"}
{"text":"Hooray for good Chinese food nearby!  Sizzling Wok, like everyone else has mentioned, is wedged between Monroe Hardware and a salon, so you have to really be looking for it. Inside, everything has a new feel with darker, soft colors that are very welcoming and soothing. In my visits, I've met several of their employees, including owner Kenny Kong, and everyone is gracious and kind.   They have a fairly standard menu, and they execute it well. The portions are incredibly large - they certainly take care of you! I've tried several items, and have enjoyed them all. As others have mentioned, the skewers are great, and I've made a meal out of just the Pu Pu platter appetizer.  If the mood for Chinese strikes and you're in the area, Sizzling Wok is the way to go."}
{"text":"The mister and I tend to settle on standbys for take-out, and Sizzling Wok has become ours for Chinese food. I haven't settled on my \"go-to\" dish yet, but I can say that the Hot and Sour soup is a solid choice. Perfect level of spice to it! I'd also recommend the Crispy Scallion Chicken if you are in the mood for a good balance between saucy/fried food. My mister is a fan of the General Tso Chicken.  I can't, however, recommend the Moo Shu Pork. If you've ever ordered Moo Shu Pork elsewhere, you know that it is supposed to come with these pancake-y wrapper things.The \"pancakes\" here appeared to be uncooked won ton wrappers. Not sure if this was a mistake or atypical presentation, but I certainly will not be ordering that particular dish again to find out.   Mint Hill is pretty limited in choices for locally owned restaurants, so Sizzling Wok gets a bonus for thriving in an area that loves chains and fast food. The restaurant is always busy at dinner time, and there are very few employees, so be mindful that you may wait a bit for your food or that the owner may be multitasking while taking your order over the phone. I can say that the owner and his employees have always been very polite in my interactions with them."}
{"text":"I think a 3 star is a bit generous. I had my first experience here today for lunch. I called in for take out. I ordered the crisp scallion chicken. The girl on the phone said it would take 20 minutes for pick up. My expectation and my previous Chinese food experience told me it should be about 10 to 15 minutes. I took this as a good sign, they must be busy. I arrived 15 minutes later to find no one in the restaurant, not a soul. It was completely empty and it was 12:30pm on a Wednesday. Wait, what?  I chatted with a nice gentleman (I'm guessing he's the owner) for about 5 minutes and then waited another 5 minutes. The food finally arrived. I'll admit, the flavor on the scallion chicken was good, more sweet than heat. There were only 2 tiny pieces of broccoli in the dish and no other veggies. Anyways, I know this is a locally owned and operated restaurant, but I just wasn't very impressed."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery for 4 on Sunday. The food was not good. 2 of the 4 of us had stomach problems rigbt away. It was also delivered an hour and 15 after we ordered. No plasticware was delivered because I did not specifically ask for it when I ordered. The latter mentioned irritants I could have overlooked. The food was not good."}
{"text":"Beef and Broccoli is mediocre and the Crab Rangoon is terrible. I would not recommend. I now go to the New Asian Cuisine right down the street."}
{"text":"I'm glad I was led to Sizzling Wok - although it take me three drive by's to find it.   I was craving Hot and Sour soup since I was feeling a bit under the weather -- and low and behold this restaurant is right by mi casa.   The soup wasn't great nor was it bad... still on the wall about this one.   Then I had  the Moo Shu Pork Pancakes... now this was yummy. HUGE portions oh my. I have enough for lunch today and for dinner later. Def will be going back or better yet take them up on their delivery!   Met Kenny, very nice."}
