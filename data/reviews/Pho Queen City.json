{"text":"Yes I gave this place 5 stars. I came here with my wife on Aug 7th. We ordered pho and spring rolls. So so fresh. Loved the fresh noodles in the pho, tasty broth and the deliciously crispy spring rolls. Pho Da Bo you have some stiff competition! This is my new Pho joint from now on. C u next week!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Pho restaurants and this one is my favorite so far lol..

My classmates and I went for lunch; We ordered crab and cheese wonton and a Veg roll for our appetizer, both were really good especially the Thai sauce yummy... Our mains were: chicken pad thai,  shrimp pad thai and chicken beef pork and rice. Food was flavourful and brought to out table warm.. The server was very helpful; she recommend to try the vietnamese iced coffee and it was good. Strong not too sweet, something I would try again. 
Prices are reasonable for the portion. Overall a good experience and would eat here again.."}
{"text":"Really fresh and tasty Bun and fresh rolls.

My regular pho joint is under renovations so I journeyed over here for a bite of lunch.

Nice service.

Good food.

$13.50 for a bowl of bun and a couple pork/shrimp fresh rolls. And a pot of cold Jasmine tea."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from the supermarket when I saw the sign on the side walk PHO \"open specials\" so I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly staff. Stephane made me feel at home immediately. The food is excellent to the last bite.
Now I don't have to drive to my favorite TI restaurant. I can walk there. Love the place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The food does not have any MSG or fake ingredients. Sabrina served us and she is great!!! If you're looking for a good affordable Pho place, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Their Pho is just divine! The broth is so good. You know it's made over time to get the best of the beef flavour, So that It's not MSG induced. I love their #49 which is a rice meal with angus beef, pork and lemongrass chicken. It's around $10 which really gives you the bang for your buck! Their staff is very good as well, they check on you if you need anything else. I love this place! Me and my boyfriend keeps coming back there and will always do!"}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews here on yelp, I decided to give this place a shot.

Nice location for parking, service is quick and servers are very nice. I had the tofu/spring roll/noodle dish. It was good, nice to have a dish like that. I'm vegetarian and I will say I liked the variety of vegie dishes they offered. Prices are good too.

They advertised that they are open till 4am on weekends, so combined with there being good parking I'll for sure go back when I have some late night Pho cravings."}
{"text":"I actually don't eat pho that often so maybe my review doesn't count for much, but for the two times I've been here the taste was consistent and prices were okay too. It's a little pricey compared to some other pho places that I've been to, but it's nothing heavy on the bank. It's also close to where I live so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"I probably came here on the first few days of opening (forgot to review), and my first impressions of this Pho restaurant were great! It is newly opened so as you would expect, it's nicely renovated and cleanly kept.  The quality of food is top-notch, and since this is a family-run restaurant, the food has a homemade feel to it, which I see as a good thing.  The owners and staff are also extremely friendly! I ordered a Bun Bo Hue and I felt as if it had the perfect amount of spice, and all ingredients are fresh to the taste."}
{"text":"One of many (if not the best) pho restaurants in Mississauga, it's run by a family who makes their pho fresh and homemade. It does have a restaurant quality to it. The sisters that run the front are extremely nice and fun and they will do anything to make you feel at home. They make a strong Vietnamese coffee and I always come back for their avocado shakes.
They're pretty generous with their meat and broth is all homemade. It's a good location, across from TLK, but parking is hard from Dundas. I always take the back entrance to where the supermarket parking is. And they're open late on weekends, so it's a little healthier than pho do thi"}
{"text":"Love this spot! I've been here a number of times the past month and haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried. I'm usually eiry on going to Viet places since I don't eat meat and there isn't usually a large selection for me but VEGETARIANS, YOU ARE WELCOMED HERE! They have a page dedicated just for non-meat eaters!

I've tried the veggie pho which came with a homemade soy sauce mixture which was EXCELLENT. Best pho I've tasted! My current favourite dish is a vermicelli noodle with fried tofu and other veg on top.

I've tried both their fresh and fried spring rolls. Their fried spring rolls are much better tasting but fresh spring rolls are a hit or miss for me. 

The place is clean, prices are amazing and the staff is really nice. It's my new go-to Viet spot! Definitely recommended!

Edit/
Officially have tried all their veggie options. It's so hard to choose a favourite but I think their stir fried noodles are my favourite. Try it!!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! Very clean and food is always delicious. I always get their vermicelli bowl (bbq beef). Their deep fried rolls are crispy and have some shrimp in it too."}
{"text":"Pretty good, ordered today for delivery.
Out of all the pho restaurants in Mississauga, I'd probably only order delivery from Pho Queen now on. 
Because it tastes good and delivery is free on skip the dishes for orders over $20."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment. 

When we sat down, no one brought us tea, water or menus. We had to ask for it. 

Our order took forever, the waiter had to apologize and explain to us they were short staffed. There was only one waiter working and while working she also had a party of 20 to entertain, most likely her friends. She kept getting up from her seat to tend to the whole restaurant and going back to sit down to eat.

When the food finally came, I lost my appetite. The inside of the spring roll was cold.

Big disappoiment. Never going back."}
{"text":"Came here on Victoria Day to try their lunch. My family didn't really have an appetite, so we ordered an extra large pho, a rice (with grilled beef, grilled chicken, and grilled pork chop), and an avocado shake to share.

The pho arrived first and it was heavenly! There was a generous serving of pho noodles (enough to split among the four of us), beef, but most importantly, tendon. Unfortunately, it appeared as if they missed our order of tripe, as there was no tripe in the entire bowl. The flavour profile was quite good, but it would've been better accentuated with the pickled chillies that you typically see at pho places - for some reason, this place lacked that condiment!

The rice came next. Although the chicken and the pork chops were good, the beef was by far the best. It was fatty, slightly charred, and extremely well marinated.

Finally, we ended things off with an avocado shake. For $5, it was a decent size, and you could really taste the avocado. It was evident that they didn't skimp on ingredients, and the shake was just the perfect amount of sweetness.

Overall, the food was really good, but slightly overpriced. Service is also excellent! In fact, it was really funny how frank and blunt the waitress was when I asked about the Vietnamese gumbo special - \"to be honest, it's a very traditional stew that people my age don't really enjoy, but my grandparents like\".

Will come again!"}
{"text":"Some decent pho here! Average decor, pretty standard for a pho place. I had the house special with a deep fried spring roll for an appetizer. Service was quite good for a pho place with the waitress coming back after serving to inquire if the food was to our liking, not often done in pho places. All in all a good meal. Would return again."}
{"text":"Our usual neighbourhood Pho place wasn't opened and nothing was going to satiate the craving. Thankfully Pho Queen was nearby so we decided to check it out.

We both ordered Pho Tai and crispy fried rolls. The rolls were great and the broth for the Pho was just right. The meat was lean, although they could have a bit more, but cut perfectly thin. 

The usual garnish came with the soup including sawtooth coriander, which is a nice touch.

The service was quick and very friendly. You can tell the staff really wants their customers to enjoy the food.

This might be our new go to neighbourhood Pho!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about here. Service, food and cleanliness are a definite 5 stars. Donna and the rest of the staff are always welcoming and helpful. The broth of the pho is fresh ans flavourful, not dense like some other pho places. Coconut slush, avocado slush and vietnamese coffee is always to par. I would come here every day if I could."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, I've been to Pho's all across Toronto, Brampton and Mississauga. But this Pho, by far, is the best pho I've ever been too. Not only is the food affordable and delicious, the customer service is even better! One thing I always struggle with at Pho restaurants is the lack of customer service. The servers at most places are difficult to understand, make absolutely no eye contact and seem to don't really acknowledge us. The customer service just isn't a there. But this Pho is quite the opposite. I would call this restaurant a hole in the wall. Its smaller than most phos, You can go here for a quick dinners or lunches. It's a great tasting, cosy spot with food that's very inexpensive. If you want to eat a monstrous meal, you're not spending more than $20 bucks. And that's with their amazing spring rolls. The servers are super friendly, they smile and acknowledge you and demonstrate the qualities of great servers. Check this spot out! There are 4 Pho's within this same vicinity, but this restaurant is the best out of the four and I've been to all lol"}
{"text":"Only came here once, but I distinctly remember enjoying my bowl of pho. For some odd reason I got the large noodles in my bowl of pho which I have to say I enjoyed very much. I used to order large noodles all the time when I was younger, but stopped out of convenience because I hated waiting longer for my food. Service was great but the place was also empty. The entrance was really far as you can only park in the back and then you gotta walk around to the front of the store. Overall, decent enough to come back but nothing extraordinaire to rave about."}
{"text":"Of all the pho places in Mississauga this is the best one. The broth is fantastic. The service is great. The iced coffee is addicting. The staff, extremely friendly.  You cannot go wrong going here."}
{"text":"Amazing! 

I came here for the first time today. I got chicken pho with chicken broth and the iced viet coffee with condensed milk. The broth was SO clear and SO flavourful! I always go to pho places but the broth doesn't compare to my boyfriend's mom's pho... But this place is the best I've ever tasted hands down. The bean sprouts and thai basil were super fresh as well.
The viet iced coffee was fun- lots of small square ice cubes and quite sweet. Perfect when you let the ice melt a bit.

The server was really sweet and friendly; she asked how my meal was when I was done, welcomed me and thanked me for coming, and she smiled a lot. 

 I have to say I was thoroughly impressed and I'll definitely be going back. 
Thank you for excellent service and delicious food :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. The quality is good, the place is clean and the staff is really nice. Recommended."}
{"text":"Not the best in Mississauga, small portions and higher cost, but delicious. The place was pretty empty too.

Came here for Dinner, our bill came to $46.00 we ordered large spring roll app, and 3 entrees.

It is true the consenses with the other reviewers their food is DEFINATELY on the salty side so be aware. You can smell their fish sauce 2 feet away from you lol.

What looked to be a lot of food actually came in fairly small portions, my vermicelli noodles was supposed to be filled with beef, chicken and spring rolls but it came to a nice portion of beef, slivers of chicken and 1 spring roll. 

And even after eatting that I was STILL hungry.  The portions of pho restaurants are usually bang for your buck but it was a very mediocre experience. 

However the food tastes Great! Feels fresh and good quality ingredients. 

The service was pretty good! Very helpful servers but they're English was hard to work with. 

My friend also noticed that they were unhappy being tipped 15% and made a smug face, but I wasn't there to notice.

It's a great place for food, family run and great recipes however there's plenty of other places in Mississauga that beats them in the market!"}
{"text":"just had another fantastic meal here!!

definitely, my go to!!

best pho, lemongrass pork and chicken!! 

best spring rolls!!"}
{"text":"Due to Pho Mi 99 on Grand Park being a bit of a disappointment these days and Golden Turtle being closed, this is my new local pho joint as it's close to my house/near Square One.

Unfortunately, these guys seem to be empty most of time (only 3-4 people in there at any time) and I'm not sure why. It may be the location because even though they are located on Hurontario (arguably the busiest street in Mississauga), the plaza it is in is quite dingy.  Regardless, I'm starting to really like this place for the following reasons:

-The servers are really nice.  It's a family run business and they operate as such as they seem to remember/know everyone's name.
-They seem to have daily lunch specials which are different than other places.  I had My Tho today (seafood plus beef and some pork) with glass noodles in broth and I also had some type of duck pho on another day for very reasonable prices  Their broth isn't overly salty but still very tasty.  
-Their special pho is pretty decent and comparable to all other places.  
-It's a bit more sophisticated than other pho joints as they seat you and actually talk to you instead of just pointing and not saying anything.  
-The actual normal \"special\" pho is pretty good.  I like the broth and the amount of meat, however my only minor issue is that there isn't enough rare beef.  

Verdict: If you are in the area and are considering Golden Turtle or Pho Mi 99 @ Grand Park, I'd re-consider and come here instead.

Tip: Debit/cash only."}
{"text":"Pho Queen City is a family run Vietnamese restaurant located in a small strip plaza in Mississauga.

Once you enter, it's your typical Vietnamese restaurant in terms of decor and set up. You write what you want from the menu onto an ordering slip and someone comes to pick up the ordering slip and when the food is ready, someone delivers the food to your table.

i ordered a medium Pho Dac Biet ($8.75 plus tax) and a small order of cha gio which are deep fried spring rolls ($4.50 plus tax).

The pho was pretty good, not amazing but definitely better than most in Mississauga. The noodles were cooked right, decent quality of beef, tendon and tripe but where they really excel is the broth. The broth had a pretty good flavour and most importantly it was msg free.

The deep fried spring rolls had a nice crispy exterior but they blend the inside ingredients too much and it allows the taro to slightly overpower the taste of the other ingredients and it loses the texture inside. It was pretty decent overall though.

The pho is probably one of the best in the Mississauga area and the prices are average when you compare it to other Vietnamese restaurants in the Mississauga/Oakville area but more expensive than say areas in the west end of Toronto. It's authentic Vietnamese food and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great gem in Mississauga. They are a family owned restaurant. Clean interior with food that is nicely presented. The pho noodles are a nice round ball, topped with very generous portions of meat.  The soup is average taste.  The basil was fresh.  I had the pho special and it was great. I want to try their house specialties next, such as the homemade stew, banh xeo, fish soup, egg noodle soup. There are a ton of choices, from Vietnamese to Thailand cuisine! Plenty of parking in the back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way home, excellent Pho, good portion of beef and noodles. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"The pho was only decent, but was MSG free which was good for my roommate who has an allergy to it. I really liked the appetizers! You write down what you want so there isn't too much interaction with a waiter, but when I paid the woman behind the cash was very friendly. Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are regulars at this family run restaurant. They have great service and are really personable. Coming from a Vietnamese person, this place has authentic and high quality dishes. If you're not into the chains like Pho 88 or Pho Do Bo, this is the spot. The dishes are also MSG free!!! They have amazing REAL fruit shakes, including durian... which we always order. We have introduced all our friends and family and now they're regulars as well. Keep it up Pho Queen. 
- TRAW"}
{"text":"Used to walk by and can't see inside because of all the photos of food on the window but we can see that it was always empty. Saw a review that says it was the best pho in Mississauga so decided to give it a try since our favourite pho place is temporarily closed. Ordered bun rieu and large pho, side of small roi cuon. Roi cuon came out like tiny twinkies tightly rolled. Was not a fan of the bun rieu or pho, the pho noodles were overdone and the broth was salty n super hot. No broth had the authentic taste. Will not return. The reviewer who said it was the best in sauga needs to owe me $35. Side note: service was great I was watching them and they were top notch to customers and us."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the food here is delicious! I guarantee that there is no MSG in the broth (I know it perfect well due to my MSG allergy). Fast service, clean, and comfortable atmosphere. If you are looking for fancy meal, not the one for you. However, if you want a meal after your long day, a hangover breakfast, or place to have dinner with your family/friends, this is the spot. The menu is simple but they give you their best quality. 
P.S: I strongly recommend their BBQ chicken. My heart beating happily the first time I tried this dish :)"}
{"text":"The service was pleasant. I would give the pho 7/10. I have definitely had better, but no other complaints!"}
{"text":"Pork vermicelli is phenomenal!  Chicken Pad Thai is definitely one of the best I've ever had and their pho is excellent and not too salty."}
{"text":"What stood out was great, attentive service.  Something often lacking in Vietnamese restaurant experiences.
Allowed to eat, get water, even have a little conversation...  
Chicken pho was really good, also enjoyed vermicelli."}
{"text":"A sweet little pho place nestled in a strip mall I would hesitate to visit alone at night unless I really wanted Vietnamese food.  I've been here a few times and have found the quality of food and service consistently good.

The restaurant is bright and inviting and smells of fish sauce.  This time I ordered the vermicelli with grilled chicken and fried spring roll.  It was delicious as usual. My friend had beef on rice.  The precious (read: few) morsels of beef were well-seasoned, but a bit tough.  

Left the restaurant feeling satisfied and smelling of fish sauce.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever tasted. So clean and generous portions. Highly recommended. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"In the heart of Downtown Mississauga lies my new fave Vietnamese Restaurant! I didn't know about this place till my co-worker took me here for lunch. They're super fast especially when you're in a hurry. 

This is a family owned restaurant, very down to earth people. There's lots of parking in the back if there isn't one available on the side. You can enter from the front or go through the Plaza.  

This place can seat up to ~25+ people. Family friendly place and also very accommodating to mothers and newborns. 

When I come here, I always order #9 their crab cheese wontons! It's a must try! I wish there were more than 4 in one serving, they're damn addictive. You can't go wrong with any of their traditional rice noodle pho. 

If your feeling a rice dish I suggest you try their beef and pork with rice. You don't often see beef on the rice menu. You won't be dissapointed. The tender yet thinly slices of meat are juicy and flavourful. I usually order chicken and pork at other Vietnamese resto but they're not thinly sliced and soft like the ones they serve here. If you also like the usual spring rolls, I say order it! It's satisfyingly crunchy and light. 


David is the usual server here but sometimes it's a lady and they are both very kind. 

Another successful Mom and Pop place in Mississauga's list of restos."}
{"text":"Had the spicy beef tenderloin pho. It was outstanding. The service very fast and super friendly. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place instead of going to the usual Korean place right next door and it was a great decision. I ended up going the following day as well and ordered chicken wings again for an appetizer, consistent taste.

What they lack in atmosphere, they make up in food. I tried the spicy beef pho the first time which was ok for me, I like it much spicier and a with a little more flavour in the broth but maybe other people will like it.

We also ordered the chicken wings which are a great price and they were actually great! Better than I thought it would be.

I also ordered the grilled pork wraps which came with rice paper you had to soak before making your wrap. The dish looks very simple but the flavours are there, highly recommend and you don't have to feel guilty after eating a dish like that.

It doesn't look like much from the outside but I would give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered pad thai from this place for delivery from skipthedishes.com. I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness and flavour. The dish was very well prepared and delicious. I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant we tried in this area.  To my surprise, the food was just excellent. The rice dish and the soup noodles were very delicious.  Also the spring rolls were just tasty. The waiters were very courteous and willing to show us what each of the sauces were used for.  If you are in this area, I would recommend this should be one of the restaurants to try out."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.. And the food is fantastic!!

I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants including ones in Toronto. This place by far has the cleanest atmosphere, and the food is tasty, well cooked and  great quality for the price. 
I'm always greeted with a friendly smile and the service is always warm and efficient, 

My favourite dishes in here are the pho , and the rice dishes with lemongrass chicken  pork and fried egg. The meat is lean and cooked really well.

For anyone looking for a good Vietnamese meal... Come here... !! 

I'll definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple weeks ago with my friend who swears by this pho place. And i have to say its not bad.

Having 3 other pho places in this area, i felt that this place had to be better then rest with competition just around the corner. What i liked was the attention here, its on point and very suggestive staff if you're not sure what to order. I ordered the chicken fried rice and it was deff flavourful and decent portions. Prices were average just like every other Pho joint. I have not yet tried their Pho soup yet but its deff on my mind, so im looking forward to coming back and trying that. The only thing i will say is that they close rather early i think 10 on the weekdays and 2am on the weekends, i do think that the hours do pay a big part in the Pho buisness considering most places close very late with open hours. Im giving this place a solid 3 stars because in my opinion it is a good family buisness. I do hope they stick around a long time"}
{"text":"Dissappointing.  When I ate there,  I decided to order Banh Xeo,  and my friend ordered Pho. First off the Banh Xeo was undercooked, and was rather tasteless, and was plated horribly. The Pho was bland and the beef almost tasted like it was going bad. The service was sad as it was only one person serving at the time. 

Not recommended for those Vietnamese people."}
{"text":"I love pho, but the owners of this place are extremely stingy. I always get 6 fresh red chillies to put in my pho (totally elevates the broth to another level) but the last time I went there, the server wanted to charge me $1.00 for the red chillies...I mean seriously. I used to like coming there but they totally deterred me from ever wanting to go there. I'd rather go to Pho Mi 99."}
{"text":"Hmmm such good reviews, which made me want to love this place but it just didn't do it for me. We had the platter or grilled pork chop and lemongrass chicken. The pork chop is the best amongst our usual Pho places but the chicken was stringy and dry. We ordered pho with rare beef, brisket and meatballs. Our meatballs were missing. The meat was soft and succulent but I wasn't a fan of their broth. Too salty and something seemed off with the flavour profile.  The server was very nice and attentive though. Verdict is that I'll be back for more pork chops but that's about it."}
{"text":"Not one of the better pho places. The prices aren't that great and neither were the meals. Very forgettable. But definitely not one of the worst."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly staff and the best pho I have had on the west end, a definite must try."}
{"text":"Based on my bowl of pho last night, I'd say this place is just awh-ight.  Broth wasn't super complex or tasty and I found it on the saltier side.  Toppings were quite fresh.

I wouldn't be opposed to going again, but it's not written down on my mental \"must go back to\" list.

Server was very quick to point out to us that the kitchen was closing and that we should get our orders in ASAP.  I understand, but I felt sorry for a couple who were turned away when she quickly snapped, \"We're closed!\"  Maybe need a bit of a refresher on customer service.  I didn't really enjoy my meal 'cause I felt rushed!"}
{"text":"My 3rd time here and I'll definitely come back again. This is probably my favourite pho spot in Mississauga. You can tell that the ingredients they use are very fresh."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at Pho Queen City.  We were surprised to see that they're open until 4am on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings. 
The food was very nice and the vegetables were extremely fresh.  The portions were generous, especially the protein served with the rice dish we ordered (pork chop and lemongrass chicken).
The server was very friendly and efficient.  
The washrooms were clean and well-stocked.
We will definitely return to this Vietnamese restaurant very soon."}
{"text":"Pho was not good, broth lacked flavour even adding salt didn't help. Fresh rolls were pretty good and server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Driving home from Square One, I was way too lazy to drive all the way to Dundas/Dixie for the always reliable Pho Dau Bo for some pho.  Decided to use the Yelp app to find a closer restaurant and discover Queen City! I was immediately greeted warmly upon entering the restaurant by a younger server, so customer service from the start was 10/10.  Despite craving some pho, I decided to order a Bun Bo Hue which I did not regret whatsoever.  The spice level was intense! I loved every bit of it! The restaurant was also very clean and classy.  In a world where the competitiveness of pho restaurants and the food industry grows everyday, only those who can go above and beyond will be able to survive.

Overall, a great restaurant with great food and great customer service! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"After having an awesome experience at Pho Mi 99, I was determined to try other Vietnamese restaurants so as to determine if Pho Mi 99 was uniquely outstanding or whether it was just the great taste of Vietnamese cuisine. 
What made me crazy about Pho Mi 99 was their vermicelli w/ grilled chicken, so that's what I planned to order at Pho Queen City. 
Located in an area full of affordable hole in the walls.
We entered to an almost empty restaurant, but looked neat and clean. The server was a young lady, whom seemed like the owners daughter. She was very friendly.
I saw that they had the vermicelli w/ grilled chicken and shrimp, which also included a spring roll. But since I didn't want the spring roll and my vegetarian friend did, I asked if they could make it a vegetarian spring roll and serve it on the side, instead of on top, as they would usually do. They agreed to my request without any hesitation.
Their iced coffee was good but was not served the way Pho Mi 99 served theirs (with a coffee drip and ice separate),  but rather was all mixed and ready. 
Once they brought the food I noticed that the vermicelli was a slightly larger portion. Also, they did not have soy sauce on the table, which wasn't a big deal since Im assuming vietnamese food doesn't usually need soy sauce,  but since I like my food with it I asked for some. The server mentioned that they only have a homemade kind. Once I tried the soy sauce I was in love as it was infused with roasted garlic so was extremely flavourful. 
The verdict for my vermicelli: good but not as good as Pho Mi 99. 
The chicken were cut into small pieces and did not have as much of that sweet glazed taste to it. I did like it though, and wouldn't mind going there again, especially after the amazing service. 
My friends favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Mississauga is Pho Do Thi. But he determined that he preferred the Pho from Pho Queen City, which says a lot.
A great restaurant and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE pho place in Mississauga.

I find the service really good compared to other pho places I've gone to in Mississauga. The girls here are very friendly and polite. That's one of the major reasons I love this place, other than their food being delicious."}
{"text":"Probally the best pho I've had outside Vietnam, no joke. Even then I think this was better then some there. The broth is so flavourful and clean. The ingredients are always fresh. The staff is very good as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch when my usual Pho destination was closed for renovations. 
Ordered rare tenderloin beef and beef balls soup (excellent price $7.75) ready in under 5min. Packed very nicely, easy to assemble and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been going there since it's opening and I have to say, I haven't had one bad experience yet. I usually don't write reviews but I felt that this place deserved it since I feel that it doesn't have the recognition it deserve. 

Food: The quality is pretty good and the pho soup is delicious. The food is in large portioning.

Customer Service: Excellent and friendly. You can tell that it is a family owned restaurant because of the amount of care and service they provide. 

Price: Fairly priced"}
