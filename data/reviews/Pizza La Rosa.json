{"text":"The food here is always hot! One of the most important things when it comes to take away!!  Their customer service is amazing! Always friendly!  But the best thing of all is their Spaghetti Bolognese! I've tried every halal place that serves pasta and this is by far the best!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite hidden gems in Scarborough -- the owner has some pretty impressive credentials!"}
{"text":"Simply a new taste of pizza that is delicious in every bite. The owner and staff are friendly people.  The meat is all halal.  Great place to go for wings as well"}
{"text":"Their pizza is so delicious! Full of cheese and tomato sauce! And the owner is super nice!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent pizza.  Excellent pizza. I'm pretty picky about pizza and I'd have to say, this one is the best pizza places, hands down! I highly recommend the Pizza Primavera, which comes with roasted, seasoned red peppers, red onions and freshly grilled zucchini (I watched the lady grilling right in front of me - now that's fresh!)   The dough and sauce are both home made - sauce has nice blend of Italian spices in it.   So far, I have been here 4 times and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Was expecting it to be a lot better than it turned out. Burned crust was the only flavor, do not recommend."}
{"text":"I went here last month with my family. We ordered a few of the pasta dishes and also got free cheesy garlic bread. The owner was really friendly and the service was excellent,I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"first time ever visiting. the people who run the biz are great, very friendly. the pizza was great, awesome fresh veggies and i would order again when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"abusolutely delicious chicken roll and lasagna  ?good sevices ?the shopkeeper is a good man and his wife also?"}
{"text":"I randomly found this pizza place on Yelp and I'm very impressed with the quality of the food and also the service. I ordered for delivery and the manager personally came himself and was very friendly and polite. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I tried their pizza for the first time last night at a friends place. I immediately fell in love with it. The dough has some seasoning that makes it distinguishable and delicious. I crave the pizza again today so I drove all the way from Markham to get some more. Since I also love lasagne I got that too. Wow the lasagne was also great. The owner is very friendly and as I walled in he mentioned all the specials going on inclduing their discounts on pizza with three toppings. This is a walk in special so I got a large pizza for 9.99. How awesome is that? I highly recommend this place. If you dont try it you will miss out on a lot. Cheers"}
{"text":"Our nearby school ordered from Pizza La Rosa for a recent luncheon. It was a big hit. The crust tastes very light and not too doughy. The toppings were plentiful and tasty. We enjoyed the grilled veggie pizza.  Overall, everything tasted homemade. In fact, it was so yummy that I went in the next day to order for my family. The owner and his wife were wonderful and gracious. It always feels great to support a local family-run business, especially when the quality of the food is superior. Tried their meat lasagna as takeout and it was absolutely delicious. Reasonable prices + great service + tasty food = lots of repeat business!"}
{"text":"This \"gold mine\" on Victoria Park makes the absolute best Spaghetti Bolognese in Toronto!  I've never even found spaghetti sauce this fantastic in high-end Italian restaurants.  I stumbled into this place and brought home a dinner order of spaghetti.  Honestly, I almost cried it was so UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME!  I later found out the owner's background is in fine dining, no wonder!  Old school spaghetti with meat sauce made with beef & veal, HUGE portion, fresh ingredients, PERFECT blend of garlic and seasonings, even the salt is in perfect balance.  I often long for this at night when I'm home and I'm not even a pasta person.  Try it, maybe you'll want to cry too!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday to place an order to take home. The owner (I think) was very friendly and professional. While I waited I brought over a soft setve ice cream, which was really nice. I ordered the veggie and the Italian. Not only did the pizza's look super appetizing, they were also delicious. If you love super spicy food, try the Italian, it was real good and spicy."}
{"text":"The pizza at this location is amazing making it one of the best Halal pizza places in the GTA. The prices are reasonable and the toppings are generous. I would definitely visit again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Friendly and courteous service! We ordered the walk-in pizza special (med 3 toppings 7.99$) and lasagna! Pizza is super good, fresh ingredients, crust was perfect to my taste and generous toppings. Next time ai will ask for extra sauce! The LASAGNA is completely delicious!! Yum!!! Seasoned perfectly, fresh and big portion! Simply amazing!!! Pizza La Rosa, you have a made yourself a new happy customer!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give them 4.5 stars but that wasn't possible. Ordered takeout. The lasagna was incredibly good and you could tell it was homemade. The pizza was tasty and I'd get it again. Wings had potential but I hate drummettes and they didn't give me any flats which I much prefer. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the combo with 2 medium pizzas , a total of 6 toppings, 4 pops, & 1 dip. We paid 25$ for pickup & added another dipping sauce to the order. All in all the pizza was decent. Sort of reminded us of frozen deliscio pizza & pizza pizza. The garlic dipping sauce was good as well which is a bonus because garlic sauce is a must with pizza! Nothing too amazing though but better than pizza pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because I like their pizza so I was able to over look the fact that the wife who works there definitely needs to work on her customer service skills. I finally had my last straw when I ordered on Justeat and she called me saying the \"special\" they had on the menu was a mistake and that they weren't going to make my food. Then she preceded to tell me to call Justeat myself to fix their menu. Wtf? So instead of apologizing for their mistake, they decided to take it out on the customer and asked me to contact Justeat for them. It was rude and handled very poorly.   5 stars for Justeat who was very apologetic about the situation and gave me a voucher.   1 star for Pizza la Rosa for the very bad experience"}
{"text":"My husband wanted pizza, local and independent.  We have tried a few in the area, we would have tried here sooner but you cannot see it from the road. We yelped it.  We ordered a variety of food.  The tomato sauce on the linguini was the best I have ever had in a restaurant, the veal sandwich could have had more meat, but the sauce made it well worth the money. The pizza had a crispy crust, it wasn't thin crust like I usually order, but it was cooked through, the texture was perfect.  My husband liked the pasta so much he ate the pizza, sandwich and ordered a lasagna.  I tried it, sooo good. The service was excellent, the gentleman at the counter was very helpful with suggestions, explained the specials, described the different sauces, told us about the home made desserts and gave us a card for pasta (order 6 m, get the 7 th free).   It's halal so I missed the bacon and ham topping, it's the only thing that could make it better.   The prices were good.  I enjoyed the pasta more than Remmizo's and it's a fraction of the price.   We will definitely be back, even though the dinning area is more like pizza pizza instead of Remmizo's, I would choose laRosa's over both."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area by a long shot! The crust and sauce are made fresh and are AMAZING and the toppings are all fresh (not pickled) and are really high quality ingredients.  Pizza is cooked to perfection and the owner is pleasant, friendly and generous. I discovered the restaurant just a few days ago and have now gone back twice! Don't let the negative review below dissuade you, give this place a try :)"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 star.  I called to ask if they deliver to lakeshore and parklawn (Toronto westside) since it says GTA.  The guy was a complete asshole and said no pizza place will deliver in the world past 25kms. Hence why I'm calling to ask!!! He then hung up on me!   Wtf. I would have been a paying customer and asked for pick up!!!   I heard they were the best pfffft I will never order from them ever in my life they need customer service skills.  Plus everything is overpriced.   Dumb asshole. Post on your website how far you deliver."}
{"text":"Was craving some pizza and am glad I didn't go to the usual pizza pizza, dominoes or Pizza Hut.    I was greeted by whom I assumed was the owner, very friendly and helpful.  The dough and pizza sauce is made in house (I should've asked for extra sauce as it was pretty tasty).  Very generous amount of toppings that amounted to an overall pretty good pizza experience.  I will definitely be back to explore their other menu items."}
{"text":"I just had the lasagna and the Meat lovers pizza and it was really good this will be my new pizza shop to order from price is really good food is awesome looking forward to ordering from there entire menu"}
{"text":"My little lady is what you'd call an olive garden variety italian so imagine the dirty look I received when I suggested we order a halal pizza. Oh Please the closest you ever been to Italy was when Nona smuggled home 3 bricks of aged Asiago in her luggage after the homecoming trip to Calabria so don't give me that look.   There's a universal ingredient in these pizzas called passion and lotsa love...ya feel me pisan? We practically invented Mediterranean cuisine for that reason...I'm talkin about when the Moors ruled Spain and Sicily type stuff.   These folks even deliver next door so don't be shy about nudging them to do it in case you get push back from my owner friend ;-) I guess good things are worth the extra effort eh chief? Next time I'll have the usual calzone use buzz code 33 and remember:   Figliuole e frittelle, quante piu se ne fa, piu vegon belle (Children and fried food: The more you make the better they come out)"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. They skimped on the more expensive toppings such as sun dried tomatoes but loaded up on the cheaper ones. Pizza was good; though I'm not sure if it was $22 for a large good. They also didn't have a thin crust option which I didn't really like.   The owners were quite pleasant.   I will return if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Pizza was good but i did expect more. The lasagna taste pretty good and the Cobb salad was also tasty."}
{"text":"If anyone thinks a pizza place will deliver 25km, they are clearly a dumbass lol. The gas costs more than the pizza, dumbass."}
{"text":"Didn't have the pizza, but did have their cream of mushroom soup, made from scratch. Nice chunky mushrooms, thick creamy broth, so thick with finely chopped/ground mushrooms that there was add much mushroom as broth, maybe more. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"i ordered the hawaiian pizza and it taste really fresh and good! they put alot of mozarella cheese and the crust is very crunchy. the guy i think he's the owner was very nice, he gave us free garlic dipping sauce and 3 free pops. i love how they treat their customers!!! i think this is one of the reasons why this restaurant has good reviews not just because of their delicious menu it's how they treat their customers. we will come back for sure and will try other gourmet pizzas and pastas. i will highly recommend this place to my family and friends!!!!"}
{"text":"best place ever. great pastas must try speghetti bolognase as pasta is perfectly El dente with beefy hearty chunks of ground beef in sauce. mmmmm  wallah is jannah   you will not appreciate the bananas and rice after eating here."}
{"text":"First time trying them .First off they have no delivery driver so you have to order through skip the dish. Meaning in had to use my credit card which I didn't want to.  prices seemed fair when I ordered until the food came . Ok pizza was good salad was good .sizes were tiny salads for the charge and they put dressing on them  which was to much .  The reason they have no small size pizza is because the medium is a small and large is a medium .  Feel ripped off a bit. And i had to call and request thin crust and have a dipping sauce sent because  u cant order that online."}
{"text":"Well, this is a landmark moment as  my (possibly) last review of 2015, and 2015 was quite the year for me. This is number 175 for me and this was technically my first year that really used yelp despite registering last year.  I look back through my review and 170 out of my 175 happen this year which I call pretty good. Im sure others have probably writen 200,300 maybe even 500 reviews this year. So this was fitting place to review for this moment given I enjoy it.  Anyways onto the great pizza I had. Pizza La Rosa, is in small plaza near Swiss Chalet, well behind it, there are alot of places to eat in area at Sheppard and Victoria from Harvey, to Big Fat Burritos to Esquires and well the biggest landmark in area Johnny's (line are too long for me to go there anymore)  So Pizza seem like a good idea and between the Italian  herb in sauce that made it taste so good to friendly owner to great deal and value what is there not to like.  You get the trio of what you want,  great food, great service and good value. You wont see 8.99 for a 3 topping medium at most place not to mention its 7.99 as walk in special and the large is like 2 buck more so large 3 topping for 11,12 buck is a great catch.  The owner and his wife are Indian, so Halal is an option if you want it which is probably a good idea, they were vote best Halal pizza in Toronto., and they are pretty nice to chat up even me as first timer, treated like a regular, thou it seem like everyone who came where long time regular which is good thing  The food is totally worth it, that sauce, those toppings, the price, it not hard to know why they survived for 15 years especially with Johnny's nearby."}
{"text":"I contacted the store manager explaining that I haven't received the refund on my credit card.  He said, \"I know you, you are trying to damage my business reputation, good luck.\""}
{"text":"Service 0/5 pizza 1/5 value 1/5  I dont know why everyone here loves this place so much cause ive tried it 3 times and been disappointed all 3 times. 1st time ordered pizza and poutine. The poutine was a sloppy mess. In a box that was beyond tiny. No value there. The pizza they gave us was all burnt in the crust. The sun dried tomato burnt. Overall a burnt sloppy pizza. And now this yime ive dried once again they have burnt the sun dried tomato. And the medium offers no value. It is a small in most places. You hope for quality to make up for size. But it doesnt. Service was shit. When i ordered medium the cashier tried to charge me for a large and argued for 5 minutes with me about it. Before they even made the pizza. And when i receieved a burnt pizza i let them know amd showed them in the photo i attached and their response is thats how i make pizza. That lady is just impolite. I urge all people to just avoid this place. Plenty of pizza places and you dotn have to pay to take that kinda crap and simply sub par product"}
{"text":"Great pizza, but they are super busy at lunch time and often miss online orders.. we have tried the vegetarian pizza.. otherwise would have given them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food quality - 5/5 stars Service - 5/5 Cleanliness/Atmosphere - 5/5 stars  Me and my SO have been going to Pizza La Rosa about 2 months since they opened. I am really impressed at the service and the quality of the food. Prices are so cheap, and the food is always delicious!  We often get their walk-in special, medium 3-topping pizza for $7.95. Whever we order pizza, I always ask for extra La Rosa sauce coz the sauce is just wayyyy too tasty! They also put such a generous amount of toppings on the pizza!  From their menu, I have tried their lasagna (really meaty!), chicken wings (10 big wings, and very saucy), poutine (yummy), and meatball sandwich (huge & super tasty sandwich) as well. All excellent! I will definitely try more from their menu and I know I won't be disappointed. Servings are huge for what you pay, money well spent!   I have been to Pizza La Rosa many times and I just love how they would add in some items 'on the house'. About a week ago I got a free dipping sauce, and today I got free jalapenos on my pizza.   I highly recommend this place. The owners provide stellar customer service. I am a regular and I visit every week. This place is my go-to pizza and pasta place, no other place can match the food quality and service that Pizza La Rosa offers."}
{"text":"Well......I came back, wasn't sure if my taste buds told the truth of this heavenly taste.    Unbelievably I forgot how great this pizza really is!!!!  The only bad thing is.....it has to be finished!!!! Then what? The price is so reasonable if you pick it up, GET 2!!!!! Pick up 3 pm to 10pm buy 1 get 1 at 50% off....   Go, do it, buy some!!!!!"}
{"text":"Owner is so sweet and the food looked and tasted like it came from a million dollar chef for only $21 I got a large 4 topping pizza,wings and a few drinks. BEST part is they're halal!!! 10/10 absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place now. It is ranked as the NO. 1 halal pizza place by blogto. It is family run and the owners provide good customer service every time.  They make fresh dough everyday, which is the secret to their delicious pizzas. Any pizza you pick, will be made with fresh ingredients, care and awesomeness. I once asked the owner about franchising, he simply answered, \"I care about how each pizza tastes, so the quality is my top concern\".   I just wish they had pizza margherita, as it will taste awesome made with their dough."}
{"text":"They make the great pasta and lasagna. The pizza was also great too of course, and a lot of topping options. The boss recommend ice cream as well, will try it out the next time."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great service and the owner seems like a very down to earth guy. I like how there are halal options. I would recommend going and checking out this place. The wings are good but not breaded. I normally only eat breaded wings but I actually really liked the way these ones were cooked."}
{"text":"Affordable place for a quick pasta and salad fix. In the same plaza as Harvey's, Starbucks and Hong Tai with a busy and crowded parking lot. Order and pay at counter and they bring the food to you. Staff is warm and attentive.  ORDERED AND SPLIT WITH HUBBY: - Warm spinach salad (regular size)with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and turkey bacon. I could have made a meal out of this delicious salad alone. -Spaghetti Alla Romana with spicy Italian Sausage, eggplant, Bocconcini and chipotle sauce was tangy and flavourful with a medium spice level.  -Garlic bread with cheese. They used a hot dog bun bleh! But they were generous with the cheese and I was very pleased to find little savory morsels of fried cheese crisps LOVE THESE LITTLE TREASURES! - Chocolate and vanilla swirl cone was better than McDonald's but not as thick and creamy as DQ's but they did fill the inside of the cone.  Pizza baked in a stone oven, dressings made in house and pasta dishes that are al dente. Food comes out quick, nice and hot and the aromas are tantalizing. Better than fast food but not quite gourmet. Great place to come for affordable lunch specials."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. Nice crust and pepperoni has good flavour. Friendly and fast service as well as cheap prices. However, I need to give 3 stars because there was a terrible smell inside the restaurant as if they hadn't taken the trash out in a while. I was getting nauseous standing there waiting for my food, and although the food was good the smell and overall hygiene of the place ruined my experience here. 3 stars but more like 2.5"}
{"text":"the pizza here is really good but I am not a fan of the parmesan sandwich. even the chicken wings step decent. the steak sandwich is okay aswell but the fries are pretty bad. I give it a 4 stars because they are a pizza joint at the of the day and they make a good pizza. my suggestion is to get thin crust and well done ."}
{"text":"La Rosa's pies are simply wonderful! The quality of their cheese and sauce go a long way to making a tasty pizza that is unique compared to the many bigger franchises in the area. Though they are marginally more expensive than let's say... Pizza Pizza, I would gladly pay the premium. The only reason why I didnt give them 5 stars is cause being so close to La Rosa has made keeping my slim figure increasingly difficult. Then again I'd rather be fat and full than thin and unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"I love these small pizza joints and all their amazing walk-in specials.  Pizza La Rosa is this tiny corner pizza spot in the same plaza as Tone Tai Supermarket. The place itself isn't really meant for eating in and is strictly takeout or delivery. The food there is Halal and they have quite a bit of stuff besides pizzas and wings.   The one special we enjoy is the Medium Pizza, 10 wings, sodas, and dipping sauce for $17!. They have a variety of toppings to choose from, with nothing very unique though. Besides our standard pepperoni, they have grilled chicken, italian sausage, and a mess load of other toppings. Pizza is cooked nicely, and though it doesn't show, I believe you can ask them to have it well-done or lightly cooked.  The wings were actually pretty good. They were drowning in sauce because of the container, but the wings at the top were juicy and lightly grilled.   The specials are great as you can pretty much steal pizza and wings. They do deliver, but it's through a third party so there are extra fees tacked on, but laziness is expensive."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST PIZZA (that's I've tried so far) IN TOWN!!   Pasta and salads are delicious as well.   Great quality, fresh, delicious and affordable food."}
{"text":"How many things could possibly be wrong?  1 Prices on their website are inaccurate  2 They have a ridiculously small delivery radius  3 Their chicken wings aren't remotely good. Not sure where you other guys are comparing them to, but you need to expand your horizons.  4 The salads are stingy, with terrible dressings and old veggies  5 The pizza, is mushy, flavorless, and infinitely worse than Pizza Nova, Domino's, and even Pizza Pizza. Enough said."}
{"text":"I called up the LA Rosa pizza,you get one pizza and half price. I to xl he said it ,$15.00 then nother pizza for have price.it he said it came out to $27.00 dollars I didn't get that Them we went over.

Give %5..00.off.it your birthday all give n $2.00.I know people the owner who do you know. Am going there any more.rude person."}
{"text":"Fantastic little pizza joint located at Victoria Park and Sheppard.   The place - this is a small pizza shop with seating for approx. 12-15 people. The owner greeted us and was super nice and helpful answering all of the questions we had.   The dough that they use is super good producing great quality pizzas. Their toppings are all fresh as well producing beautifully coloured pizzas.   We ordered the pepperoni (beef), mushroom and green olive extra large pizza ($14.99). My fiancée had never tried 'pepperoni' before and their pepperoni comes very close to what actual pepperoni tastes like.   The pizza was evenly sauced and the tomato sauce used was delicious and not too acidic. The pizza was also perfectly cooked giving it a nice crunchy bottom and some nice charred bits on the crust.   All in all a great pizza for great value with excellent, friendly service that comes with a smile.   The owner even threw in a free dipping sauce for us.   Go eat pizza now!! ;)"}
{"text":"MashaaAllah! This is a must try for anyone who is a pizza lover. Store is nice and clean your able to see your pizza being made trust me I am so going there again ! Found my new pizza home lol"}
{"text":"Just found this place and been twice in 2 days. First, the prices are fantastic.  Not sure how they can afford it. The owners are great the place clean and has decent seating for what is primarily a take out place.  First time in got a 3 topping medium pizza for $9 with taxes, even for a crappy pizza $9 would have been worth it.  This pizza however was not crap, it was in fact pretty awesome.  Next day I went back to try one of their sandwiches (chicken parm.) it was real good size and very tasty.  I will certainly be visiting this place again. The only thing I did not enjoy on my visits was the bacon I ordered for my pizza was clearly not bacon... but that is on me because I was aware this place was halal before I went in and forgot that when picking toppings.  The replacement wasn't bad, just wasn't what I was expecting."}
{"text":"So so good. Pizza is delicious and hearty. And the chicken wings taste so homemade and so delicious! Also they're not like monster-sized, creepy, genetically modified chicken wings like what you might see often at a chain restaurant. Seriously good!"}
{"text":"What's better on a snowy December day than an amazing slice -- or six -- of fresh, delicious pizza? I read about Pizza LaRosa on Yelp and decided to venture in. The owner and his wife greeted me immediately and made me feel really welcome and I placed my order for a medium pizza with chicken, black olives and mushrooms. I waited less than 10 minutes -- and my pie was ready. It was incredible -- fresh, loaded with toppings and downright amazing. This place is a real gem. It always has daily specials for pizza, pasta and veal sandwiches and you can tell everything is made from scratch with a premium placed on the freshest ingredients. A great find -- and this place will be my go-to for amazing pizza. If you're in the Sheppard and Victoria Park Avenue area, Pizza LaRosa at the south east corner of the intersection, right in front of the Tone Tai Supermarket is where you need to go!"}
{"text":"Given the choice I would rather support small local owners instead of big franchises. So when my coworkers voted on a pizza lunch I suggested to try Pizza La Rosa instead of Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova. I am happy I made that choice.   I was reading their flyers and they claim to make their own sauce and dough, they are never frozen. The flour is also top grade from Italy, 100% vegan, no additives and preservatives and no sugar added. It all sounds great and the food quality is obviously higher. We ordered two walk in specials, large pizza with 3 toppings each. They don't skimp on their toppings and the cheese, omg the cheese. The crust was also very tasty, you can smell there's herbs and spice on the crust. I can eat the bread all by itself.   From the outside it looks like its a take out place, but inside there's about 4 tables so its great for a quick bite in the area. The owner is hilarious and really friendly. Service is top notch and I would definitely recommend trying their pizza."}
{"text":"Tried their walk in special yesterday ( medium pizza with 3 toppings for 7,99$).  So delicious, especially the sauce."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, big portions , great taste, under 10 deals. Humble owner. Clean sitting. Good for American style Pizza and Pasta. They do customize, to fit your needs.  All of vegetarian options available.  For people who prefer Halal, this place serves halal food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past year. Hubby and I normally share a pizza and salad. Really enjoy both. Ingredients are fresh every time and well prepared. Owner/staff are always friendly. We always like eating at the restaurant which has only a few tables, but we are usually the only ppl there so we get great attention! Last visit we shared the lasagna which I really wanted to try after reading another review, a large garden salad, and veal parm sandwich. And 2 drinks. I think the total was about $30. The lasagna was delicious and a good size portion. The noodles were al dente and the sauce was perfectly meaty and balanced. I can't wait to go back for lasagna again! After having half the lasagna and half the salad, there was no room for me to eat the veal sandwich. I doggie bagged it for the next day. It was good but probably better if I'd have eaten it fresh. Oh well next time maybe... If I don't get the lasagna, which is unlikely! Other stuff to note. Parking can be difficult in the plaza but we always find a spot. Washroom is new and clean. The place overall is small but new and clean. There's a television playing cp24. Lots of drink options (including San Pellegrino)."}
{"text":"2 times I ordered online from this place, both time they cancelled my orders, will never order back from this restaurant, what a joke!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place if we don't know what to eat for dinner. Their food is delicious and tastes home cooked. Our faves are their meat lasagna, chicken parm sandwich and their Greek salad. The price is very reasonable for the portion size. The portions are actually pretty large. The owners are super friendly and down to earth. It's an ideal place for take out or delivery or just a quick bite."}
{"text":"I live in the US and was ordering delivery as a surprise for my sister who lives in Toronto. Owners were very nice and delivered the pizza and wings at the correct time I requested. My sister said the pizza and wings were very tasty and has made it into her roster for last minute dinner options. Great service, great food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"To start off I'd like to say the owner is so kind and welcoming! He tries to make you laugh and just overall very nice.  I've tried the chicken Parmesan sandwich and loved it. The bread was fresh, the tomato sauce was flavourful and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  I also tried the pasta with chicken, Parmesan cheese, peppers. I thought this was just OK. We ordered garlic bread and wasn't a big fan. The flavour wasn't good, the cheese wasn't melted, overall wouldn't order that again.  I really recommend their sandwiches"}
{"text":"Service was a bit awkward, the person who I'm assuming is the owner or manager suggested I order a slice and pop for 4 dollars, a decent deal right? But when I paid he told me the Hawaiian slice is actually not part of the special (so why would you tell me to have this kind then?) so I was thoroughly confused.  Anyway, the pizza itself was your average run of the mill type: stale cardboard dough, mushy cheese, runny tomato sauce (they say they make their own), and toppings they aren't even Hawaiian on a Hawaiian pizza (who the hell puts hot sausage?)  It's really a shame that this place doesn't make good pizza, this area really needs a good pizzeria.  If rather go back to the crappy pizza pizza at the corner of sheppard and VP than this place."}
{"text":"For our halal brothers and sisters this place is amazing, food size portions and very well priced. You will leave satisfied with this place..:)"}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The manager is very friendly and nice. The pizza is good and big. I can only finish half of the medium size. Very good place."}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery and received an automated confirmation.  I waited 1 hour. I then called 4 times (to check on my order) and got the voicemail every time.  I left a message.  I asked the hotel front desk to call the same number; they answered. They said they never received my order (I have the email confirmation to prove it) and that they don't deliver to my hotel anyway.  Horrible communication and customer service."}
