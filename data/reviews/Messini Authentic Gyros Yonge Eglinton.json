{"text":"Messini on the Danforth is one of my favourite Greek restaurant on the strip.  

This location is a bit different - very much like a fast food joint in a food court. 

The food is good - same as the Danforth location, much smaller menu, but that's to be expected with such small space (only about 12 tables, 2-4 seaters each) 

But here's where they lost all the stars. The cashier and order taker at the front is complete rude. We had no clue what her problem is, but she was giving everyone attitude. Customers, the chefs, the woman who was clearing and cleaning tables. It was so disturbing I didn't even want to stay because every time we looked that way, she was giving someone a disinterested look,  rolling her eyes and smacking change into people's hands. Not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks      they officially closed their door the weekwnd.    So you have to go to the Danforth for Thier amazing  gyros.   Most of the friendly staff  will also move there"}
{"text":"Finally this place is open! They have been 'working' on this location since early spring. And as the one of the staff mentioned to me today, they had some issue with the previous construction folks and they had to change contractors..... blah blah blah... what about the food?

Highlights:

- As you enter you're greeted by the smell of roasted lamb and wonderful spices.... mmm... I'm drooling as I type this. And guess what... I got a lamb Gyro on a pita. This was served with tomato, onion, tzatziki and FRENCH FRIES.  All wrapped in a soft and fresh pita. There was a massive amount of meat and all the other toppings so this bad boy looked pretty stuffed. How did it taste? REAL GOOD! how good? It made me sing opera good! This was all about the lamb baby and the lamb taste came through perfectly and boldly and the rest of toppings enhanced the lamb flavour. 

- Quick! Got my steaming hot sandwich in 5 minutes.

- Friendly staff.

- Of course they also serve chicken Gyros. Chicken and pork souvlakis. Dinner plates, just like the Danforth location, blah blah blah... but it was all about the LAMB!!!!!

- Take out or dine in. 

- Pretty cheap! Everything is pretty much under $10. My sandwich was $6 after taxes!

So next time you're in this neighbourhood, and looking for a quick bite, go here!"}
{"text":"Very good greek place! Generous portions and yummi food!
They have a nice combo that two people can have - two dishes, two sides... it's very filling with good stuff!
It's also close to the Yonge Eglinton center - so quick dinner and movie! It's healthy, clean and a nice change from the mainstream quick food chains !
Hope you all go and enjoy it !"}
{"text":"Meat meat meat.  The more the better.  Ordered the combination platter, pork from the spit and a chicken stick with salad and fries. A little disappointed that it did not come with a pita.  But, that was the only setback.  Everything else was down pretty well.

Between this and Greek brothers, i can't decide a winner.  Greek brothers presentation was a little better and portions was a bit bigger.  I was really full coming out.   Messini, i have to admit, still a bit hungry afterwards.  Maybe i was just too hungry or my stomach  has expanded.  

Will i come back... yes!  I wish they open one in York region."}
{"text":"I love it here. We often go here when we're in a rush on our way to the subway. It's delicious, saucy and flavourful. At first I thought the french fries inside would be strange but no way, it's perfect. I always either get the chicken or the pork souvlaki. Just the sandwich is enough for me they are big and filling. They are also a really good price. It's always pretty busy the wait for my food is almost always longer than it takes me to eat it. It's closed apparently and will travel to one of their other locations for this, I know I'll crave it."}
{"text":"An excellent Greek establishment in North Toronto. Their gyros are reasonably priced at $5 to $6, depending on the variety. The portions are HUGE and the quality is superb. However, it seems that their lamb recently has gotten a fattier and the chicken's taste is purely dependent on who preps it. On some days it's flavourful and tender, on others it's somewhat bland and on the dry side. But overall, this is an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of the Danforth location for over 8 years now and after this location opened I decided to try it out as well because it was convinient at times. It's more of an on the go location.  I was at the cashier ready to order.  The girl was sitting down,  chewing gum and on her cellphone. Very rude and unprofessional. All that aside the food tasted a bit worse  compared to the Danforth location as well. I will be coming back however most likely to the Danforth location."}
{"text":"We ordered both the lamb and mixed gyros pita and they were ok. The mixed pita was a bit better as the lamb was dry.

Prior to coming here, we read that sometimes there is a long wait period for the food so as we were on a tight schedule we called in hoping to place an order for pickup as we were just 10 min away. Well we called several times (4 to be exact) and each time they hung up on us. At first, I thought it was an accident but subsequent calls proved otherwise.

When I got there at 5:30 pm (Wed), the place was near empty and quiet. So much for customer service! It would have been nice for them to pick up phone and say they don't take phone orders... Don't expect too much in hospitality.

We much prefer the Danforth location instead. Better service."}
{"text":"Love the pork gyro here. Always tender and moist and loooove the feta fries! It's drizzled (or fried?) in this ever so yummy garlic oil. If you're looking for something delicious, cheap, and filling, this is the place to go :)"}
{"text":"very little courtesy and unkindness from the person who took orders at checkout. I didn't enjoy my dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had the lamb gyro wraps/pitas both times. My main complaint is that the gyros, although tasty, are actually very greasy. A large part of the grease could be attributed to the fries they stuff in the wrap (delicious and crispy, but a lot of that grease will end up everywhere else other than collecting in the wrapper). 

Greek salad is pretty standard, nothing special except for the feta cheese which melts in your mouth. 

Be sure to get a drink with your meal...I guarantee you'll be feeling a bit parched afterwards."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and large portions! Many of the plates are shareable sizes...expect to be pretty full when you leave."}
{"text":"Messini is probably my favourite take out in the city. I usually go with the lamb, which tastes the best in my option. However, the chicken is good too. Not a big fan of the pork tho. Yet, I'm sure that depends on personal taste :) 
Besides, it is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"When there are not many options around later in the evening at Yonge and Eglinton, this place is a decent option. The chicken gyros with a side of olive spread subsides one hunger but the black olive spread is too salty, and their chicken gyros is quite oily , the Chicken souvlaki will be a healthier choice but that is often dry cooked :-( in case you crave fries , try their Greek fries with a few friends, as the oil and salt after a few bites becomes too overwhelming. Greek style fast food in general in North America is too salty and mucus producing based."}
{"text":"Things to order: Pork Gyros Pita ($4.43). It's loaded with meat and fresh french fries. Very satisfying meal by itself, don't order extra fries or their combo. Save your money for weekly grocery instead.

The Pork Souvlaski is pretty hard and dry, skip this one and order the Gyros.

It's my favorite place for cheap meal."}
{"text":"A bit different from their legendary Danforth location as there are no servers just tables and some damn good food.

I will give you all one huge tip if you are going with two or more people. Thank me later.

Get the Combination plate. Get either two gyros or pitas with fries, salad, and olive tapenade for $15. Make your fries Greek for an extra buck and you have the best deal in the city dollar for dollar."}
{"text":"Messini is one of my favorite places to grab gyros on the Danforth, and now they've finally opened their new location in Midtown- just a block or so north of Yonge & Eglinton.

Like the Danforth location, this place is dim-lighted, narrow and small. Staff here is quick and friendly, and there is no waiter service here, yet. The have a small, clean and very simple dining area in the back where you can seat yourself after you pick up your order at the counter. They have take-out here as well and the food is priced very reasonably. The biggest hit here is the gyros and it's the best! 

For those who have not had a gyros, it's a pita generally stuffed with meat (chicken, pork or lamb) and topped with tomatoes, onions, tzatziki sauce and french fries. This is considered Greek fast food and Messini makes the most authentic gyros. Their chicken souvlaki pita ($4.61) has a fluffy, warm and slightly crispy pita, the meat inside is fresh without being too greasy and generously stuffed in with the toppings- just perfect and super filling! The lamb gyros is a bit on the fatty side though. The Greek salad ($5.25 small) here is authentic too, meaning no lettuce! The Greek salad has black olives, fresh chunks of tomatoes, green peppers, sliced onions, refreshing cucumber and generously topped with creamy feta. I also like their feta fries ($3.95)- circular fries with olive oil, oregano with a ton of feta! I didn't like their side of rice ($2.95), it was too bland and boring.

Besides gyros, they also have a nice list of cheap appetizers, souvlaki entrees, dinner pita plates, meat and seafood from the grill and so much more. I'm looking forward to trying their kebabs the next time I stop by.

Overall, Messini is a great place to stop by for some inexpensive authentic Greek food that will keep you full all day."}
{"text":"Ok, here is the latest on this place....

I decided to go back to Messini because I was really feeling like a Gyro... I attempted to order the lamb gyro plate,however they didn't have lamb AGAIN !!!! This caused the clown behind me to be concerned as he clearly wanted lamb as well. How is this possible??? Why are they doing this to me? I'm here on business!!!


How is this supposed to be a greek place if there is no lamb ????? Are we not worthy of lamb????  I feel insulted!!! ridiculed !!! I feel that I have been made a spectacle of !!!I"}
{"text":"The price is really good and the food is even better, I got the mix gyro with extra feta cheese and no onion!!! 
Love this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a handful of times already and I've only ever ordered one thing: the Pork Gyros Pita combo with a drink and upgraded Greek fries. Best pork gyros pita I've had. The meat is plentiful and not dry like most others and is packed with fresh fries. I love their Greek Fries which is essentially round/rippled fries with feta cheese melted on top -- so good! Other than that, I can't really say much else about the place or the other thnigs on their menu. I usually do takeout anyways, which is always fast! One of my favourite lunches throughout the week."}
{"text":"This place certainly has a different vibe than the original Danforth Messini's - no congregation of the Greek masses at 2am but rather the working types grabbing a bite and similarly looking for a new alternative to the unappealing Eglinton Centre food court. Lots of places to sit, and it is always very clean.

Prices are comparable to other lunch spots - from $8-9 for a pita or skewer with a side of your choice (potatoes, salad or fries) and a fountain drink/bottled Ioli water. The Greek salad is pretty good although portions are less than the potatoes (which are very plain). Both chicken and pork skewers are good.

Tzatziki doesn't have enough kick (ahem, where's my mandatory gnarly garlic-breath?) and I think they must use less-expensive sour-cream in the place of heavier yogurt.

For the mid-town types who aren't fresh on their Greek, remember Gyro ('Yee-row') is pronounced like \"Hero!\""}
{"text":"How can you beat a delicious chicken gyro sandwich for less than $6 at Yonge and Eglinton?! Greek fries are awesome - something that I know I'll develop cravings for after a few drinks on a Saturday night. Good thing this place is open late! 

Highly recommend the chicken gyro, Greek salad, and Greek fries. Will definitely be back again soon. And often."}
{"text":"This is everything you want from a quick service Greek restaurant. I had the chicken gyro meal with salad.

Healthy portions of well-spiced meat, served with red onions, tzaziki and choice of side (I had the Greek salad - which is actually in a village salad style because there was no lettuce). Seriously - if the owners read this, do not change the recipe for the chicken and do not make the portion of chicken any smaller. If I had one piece of advice it might be that there was may just a little bit too many red onions. But that's it, otherwise really great chicken plate.

Walking in I did not expect much and chose to eat here because of its close proximity to the movie theatre.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here countless times but I always get their LAMB or BEEF GYRO. Amazinggg w fries inside and everything else ! Not your typical gyros or shawarma. You Have to try it!!! Also if you have a chance, be sure to check out the messinis on Danforth too!"}
{"text":"Why 3 stars? The service. Right from the get go the staff was lost. They had no idea how to work the Visa machine, the guys making the food were yelling at each other and you could see that they had given up.
I had the Lamb Gyro on a pita and it was pretty good. The meat could have been hotter and the pita warmer, but the taste was delicious. I also ordered a side of rice; for the $3 they charged, the portion was tiny and the flavour non existent."}
{"text":"Messini has been under construction for quite awhile, and I just had to try it when it opened.

I was expecting more of a sit-down restaurant establishment, but most customers are ordering take out. The menu has everything a Greek fast food chain can offer, except they were sold out or out of stock on a lot of the items. 

\"Can I get the chicken souvlaki?\"

\"Sorry, we're out of chicken.\"

\"Can I get the pork souvlaki?\"

\"We don't have that today as well..\"

So, I ended up ordering the most expensive item on the menu - Lamb Gyro on potatoes - for around $12 a plate. 

The lamb was really good, but maybe too oily for my preference. The potatoes were also very greasy. Portions were huge, 2 people can easily share a plate of lamb gyro and walk out stuffed. 

The self serve soda station was surprisingly clean and organized, with no spills/sticky mess. 

Next time, I would try the pita (if they have it that day) to avoid going into a food coma."}
{"text":"I really like the food,  but the staff is rude.  They let another person pass before me even they knew I was next, and they gave my girlfriend a pork gyros instead of chicken. Also the place was very cold. I couldn't recognize if I was inside or outside. Food is good,  but it is better to take out or order online(I don't know if it is possible) to avoid rude staff and a cold place."}
{"text":"What can I say? Being a fan on the original Messini on the Danforth in Greektown, this place can do no wrong. Best gyro in the city, huge pitas for great prices. Just came from this newer location with my fiancée. Ordered a chicken gyro and greek salad and he got roasted potatoes, a chicken gyro, and a mixed pork and chicken gyro, all for about $22 after tax. Awesome price especially considering the authenticity, taste, and immensely filling portions! It's no where near as busy as its older sister yet but I suspect it will be soon, if not busier. Stop by this place for a gyro, your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"Dirt cheap, straight up delicious greek fast food. The prices for the gyros wraps are a better value than McDonalds. This stuff leaves you full for hours on end, and every bite is incredible. However, I do have to say their customer service is not up to par. You feel this \"Eat your shit and get out\" kind of vibe, and the staff on duty are not always the most polite. Still, some good ass food that I will be enjoying for a long time, at least until they start cheaping out."}
{"text":"I loved the gyros and the fries. Unfortunately they are closing this location by the end of the month."}
{"text":"Fries and pita for $7?!? Sounds like an amazing deal to me! 
Their wraps are super filling and they are extremely generous with the meat. I've never actually finished the entire thing because I get so full after half which is pretty awesome because if someone is willing to share with you, you get full on only $3.50 :D Score!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows this place has wicked gyros.
Had the lamb and pork one, and to me the pork souvlaki meat idea bit dry, but still very tasty.

Lamb was perfect!

I had an inkling to try their Aryan beverage (yogurt drink) and I gotta say it's probably an acquired taste.

Literally tastes like watered down plain yogurt with salt.

Weird thing is its fun to share with a buddy for a laugh, and it does make u feel kinda good drinking it."}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch yesterday and the service was absolutely horrible. The counter girl was not only rude but she was more into socializing. I asked her for the cup I paid for and she kept ignoring me since she was busy talking to one of the cooks. Rolled her eyes at me. The food wasn't great either, the lamb had too much fat."}
{"text":"What a bargain... a huge Gyro for just $5. Probably the best deal in the area.

Great for take out but they also have lot's of seating in the restaurant. Tables are fast food style but the place is spotless.   

I had the Chicken Gyro which tasted great. A large portion of delicious chicken, tomato, onion, Tzatziki sauce and french fries wrapped in a perfectly grilled pita. The fries are a nice addition to the Gyro. 

I tried a piece of the pork Gyro and didn't find it as good - it was kind of dry, maybe cooked a little to long.

I had a small greek salad on the side which was also good. No lettuce, but lot's of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, black olives and Feta cheese. Once again, the portion was huge. 

The staff generally seamed friendly but the woman at the cash really didn't want to be there, she was just going through the motions.

If your in the area, stop by. Good food at a great price!

BK"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best deals in the city.  For five bucks or so, depending on your choice of gyro or souvlaki, you get a pita packed with meat, onions, tomatoes, tzatziki, and FRIES!  

Sometimes the lamb is a bit on the fatty side.  The chicken and pork can sometimes be dry, depending on the time of day.  

All in all, a delicious lunch, dinner, or (big) snack!

If you're on the east side, the Danforth location is the original."}
{"text":"Same owners as the one on Danforth but no where near as good! Slow service, rude staff, menu was not complete - not the true Messini's service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything about Measini is authentic greek! They make one of the best Greek salads in the city. What makes it so great is that it is truly a greek salad. Fresh, crips cucumbers, green peppers and tomatoes, topped with a generous helping of feta cheese. 

Their gyros contains no mystery meat and a good portion of French fries, just like in Greece! Pork, chicken and lamb are roasting on their rotisserie as soon as you walk In. Their souvlaki and roasted potatoes are outstanding. Messini won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Luckily there weren't many patrons sitting nearby to hear how many times I said \"Mmmm\" while I was eating!  Fantastic food, value, pleasant staff, nice environment. Haven't eaten much meat last 6 months but had uber intense craving today for gyro - not shawarma but real Greek gyro - definitely hit the mark and satisfied the primal carnivore in me :)
Will def b back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a treat! 

Ordered gyros with the greek fries. Was stuffed. I loved their home style potatoes. Crisp golden potatoes fried to the perfect texture and then on top of that they smother it with feta. The fries were definately a highlight as they would also have pockets of air and as u bite into them combined with the feta cheese and hot sauce was delicious!

So much cheese; so generous. Walk in and see the different meats marinating and sitting on the shawarma grills was a tease that I could not wait to indulge. Sandwiches are priced very fairly and stuffed Its a great location to sit in or to do take out.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nope. Had tried Messini on Danforth twice, and was hesitant to try again based on my past experiences eating at the Danforth location. But my friend ordered something here so I figured I'd give Messini another try. 

I ordered the chicken gryo pita. Granted, it was pretty cheap for the amount of food you get ($6.25 incl tax), but still not worth it in my opinion. The food doesn't taste like much. I had to keep putting Franks Red Hot on mine (that was the only option) because it otherwise tasted super bland. Didn't taste garlic at all.

So now I've had Messini three times, and disappointed each time! No more Messini's for me."}
{"text":"Messini is most famous for one thing: their Gyros wrap. For around $5, you get this wonderfully delicious and large wrap filled with your choice or pork/chicken/gyros/lamb. They stuff it with fries and traditional ingredients like tziziki sauce and onions. 

My only real complaint is that the pita wrap is often greasy but this is one of the few things worth getting fat for! 

Their pita wrap is so good that I've made many resolutions to try their other stuff but each time I come, I always end up getting the wrap. The wrap is so filling and delicious that I simply can't bring myself to order something else. One time I was really hungry and I simply ordered 2 gyros wraps instead of pondering other options...seriously I'm going to keep coming here until I get sick of their gyros so I can try something else. 

They have a stamp card system that rewards you with a free pop or gyros."}
{"text":"Greek fries gyros pita's what more can you ask for. This place is always good friendly and a sure thing when looking for really good Greek food"}
{"text":"Firstly, I ordered a lamb gyro, which cost $6.95. The menus aren't posted on the wall. There is a menu at the counter and a lunch sign with the specials. I originally expected it to cost less so I wasn't prepared for the extra change I had to get out of my bag. So in my clumsy exchange, I accidentally knocked over the lunch sign, which knocked over a stack of cups. The lady behind the counter must have been quite cross with me for knocking over her set up. Very embarrassed, I gave her the right change and straightened the sign. For future reference, be more prepared with extra change on hand. My friend ordered the pork gyro, which was cheaper by about a dollar. The gyros were ready in a few minute and quite warm. My friend thought his lacked the tzaziki sauce and I thought mine could use some more fries but that's just being picky. They were very generous with the meat and it was moist and crisp at the edges. The gyros are also bigger than I expected. I was  very much enjoying my gyro until I reached the end. All the oil and grease had pooled to the end and the pita bread had soak it up. I was literally dripping at the end. I lost out of my last 3 bites of my gyro due to the overwhelming amount of oil. Overall, I enjoyed it very much and plan to return to try their other options with the appropriate change."}
{"text":"If you like gyro, this is the place to get it. The price is really good for what you get. I've tried pork and lamb. I prefer the lamb. I know some people who can't eat lamb, but the lamb gyro here is what keeps me coming back. 

5/5.

lamb."}
{"text":"Another location has opened - happy face. 

For $5.50, you get a H U G E chicken gyro pita; the fries in the pita is a nice touch. It's mostly a take-out place, but there is also a dining area. It's clean and you get a full view of food being prepared. I have noticed that most of the guys cooking were at the original location on the Danforth. 

A good place if you need to grab a quick lunch. I work in the area so can't W A I T to come here again with my Foodie work colleagues."}
{"text":"My salad was too sour. Too much vinegar probably.
My order took 2x as long as normal because they mislabeled my order or something so it was just sitting on the counter.
The souvlaki wasn't bad, but because of the above 2 issues I'm not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"Messini has been my favorite for years and I am happy they have a second location. Trust me and order the roasted potatoes!!!!"}
{"text":"There is only one reason why you would go here: the food.

I've always been impressed with the flavor of the food here. The meat is cooked with the proper crisp and it goes well whether as a  gyro wrap or a dinner plate. I also appreciate that they are very generous with feta cheese in their dishes.

My top picks from their menu would be the Greek salad, chicken gyro (plate or wrap), and the odd concoction that is the Greek fries. (True story: there is no \"Greek fries\" in Greece).

The ambiance and venue itself is not inspiring and quite pedestrian and is a far cry from their Danforth branch. But like I said, the food will make you happy and not the place itself.

In the Yonge & Eg area, Messini is a class of its own when it comes to Greek food."}
{"text":"I prefer this place over the Danforth location. Overall some of the best value food you can find. Gyros are executed well, with ample amount of meat. If you order the dinner combos with fries and salad you'll be in for a treat for the amount of food they give."}
{"text":"Great Greek food - super garlic-y so you may want to avoid it for a business lunch.  The lunch crowd is also a lot of students and will be difficult to get a seat - take out is recommended.  The gyros, pork souvlaki and their potato are delicious but a little odd with fries in the wrap.  The side salad is also huge with many vegetables and a heap of olive oil. Recommended for a hearty lunch."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and a huge fan of gyros. I love Messini's gyros. I ordered the Chicken Gyros. For $7, it's a pretty good size gyro and they made very tasty with the right seasoning and sauces. The chicken was nicely cooked and love the idea of fries in the gyros. I would highly recommend this place as a quick place or takeout food when you're hungry. Will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I will not coming back for a while until i forget the experience and come back to the same result!!

I order take out the other day and ordered a chicken Gyro pita and chicken gyro plate.

Chicken in both plates was overcooked and with no flavour, it seems that the chicken was left in the skillet to too long and dry up.

The rice on the gyro plate didn't have any flavour it was boiled rice with nothing.

Pita filling were ok and it was the best of both plates."}
{"text":"Phoned in for a take our order and was told it would take 10minutes for it to be ready. Came in 10 minutes later to pick up, and it took another 20min for them to make it, because nothing was made yet. Food was not worth the wait. Cheap though!"}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was tasty, inexpensive, and filling. Furthermore, the staff was nice and welcoming. An overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok.  It's close by to us and the wife loves Greek so we walked over.  

The cashier was brutally rude with us because we were taking our time reviewing the menus.  

We sat down and waited for our food.  The food was good but not anything I would call earth shattering.   If we were in need of a fix we would probably go back but it doesn't qualify in my books as a must try on the Toronto scene.  Maybe people really love the late night eats."}
{"text":"If i could have the ability to rate in negative. I would have given it a -5 stars.
Cold Food, No flavour, No taste. Worst Shawarma i ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Pathetic portion of meat, I tried the lamb antree which is 15$ and for this I got mostly fries and a salad.
Half the meat was just chunks of fat with tiny parts of meat. This is absolutely unforgivable... what a joke... do they do this regularly to make more money off garbage pieces of meat? I'd never expect such bs from a greek place.  Never going back ever.

If I could give it zero stars I would!!!!"}
{"text":"The quality is too hit-and-miss for me. Sometimes the chicken souvlaki pita is very tasty and other times the chicken is way overcooked and the pita is clearly stale. Shame."}
{"text":"There's a $15 combo deal where you get two gyros and a choice of two sides and really, how can you go wrong with that (obviously when you're going with someone else)? I have noticed that things are a bit hotter and juicier and fresher on Friday evenings, I guess because they're going through so much stock, but still this is a great deal for a cheap eat."}
{"text":"If you enjoy terrible service, undecooked and underseasoned food than this is the place for you.

The seating arrangements in this restaurant are disorganized and it seems nobody in the restaurant wants to take responsibility for anything.

Completely different to the one of the Danforth and seems the owners are trying to get customers in based on the reputation on the Danforth.

Went there for a meal with the wife, asked for a menu and was looked at like i was speaking Dutch finally got a torn up take out menu and quickly ordered a couple of Gyro dinners with potatoes.

Food was disgusting, undercooked, underseaoned mush. As for the Taziki zero flavor.

I will definitely not be coming back here. Even the location on the Danforth is slowly going down hill greasy and a little tasteless at times."}
{"text":"I arrived in the afternoon and the place seemed slightly busy. I heard about this place through friends, Yelp and Urbanspoon. Just North of Eglinton on Yonge, this place seems to have developed a good customer base. 

I ordered the Lamb Gyro plate - it was just a huge container with lamb, slivered onions, tzatziki sauce and French fries. Other options aside from fries were rice or a salad. I opted for the fries because it seems to be the fan favourite.

I ordered my food to-go and in less than a minute my food was ready. 

I found the food somewhat greasy. It was very flavourful, had lots of tender meat and some crunch (somewhat burnt parts). These burnt parts I think were intentional and it tasted good. The fries were salted, just enough to compliment the lamb. I think the only con was the grease, but maybe that's just how this dish is prepared? My bag was just flooded with grease so it was kind of a turnoff. 

Wish a salad was part of the combo but it wasn't. To have only meat and one side seemed a little plain and expensive. Overall, the meal was good if you're a devout carnivore. I recommend to try this place once. Not sure if it's something that I would return to though, unless I were with a group of friends. 

The lady at the cash was also somewhat rude and had tunnel vision staring at her laptop instead of providing customer service. I guess she was having a bad day. Still, this place is worth trying. Pretty good Greek spot for something that isn't on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Having recently returned from santorini Greece, I've been craving some gyro goodness. The pork gyros here don't exactly fit the bill, but aren't completely off the mark either.

The meat is tasty but a bit dry and greasy, the sauce and toppings are ok, the pita was stiff. Overall, not blown away. It's a gyro. It's greek. But is it authentic... No. Not by a long shot.

If you feel like a generic uninspired quick gyro, hit this place up. Otherwise, go to the Danforth to get something actually worth its salt."}
{"text":"The one in Greektown is so much better. Same menu but tastes different. I miss my pork soulvaki pita in Greek town. The fries and soulvaki here seemed to have been sitting around for awhile. I went late afternoon around 430 pm. Not the most popular time. It'll probably taste much fresher if you go on the weekend or right at peak lunch time when everything is fresh. Don't get me wrong the flavors are there and its good but the fries were stale and hard and meat was over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"Having had a lamb gyro pita and a greek salad for lunch yesterday, I'm revising this review to 4*.  The salad is definitely the way to go in terms of your choice of sides.  It is almost a meal in itself and is loaded with feta.  Awesome.  Lamb gyro was also yummy."}
{"text":"Great place for workday lunch, though you'll need a bit of patience as the line gets long and doesn't move all that fast.

Food portions are gigantic compared to most other places. Even outside of a combo, you can get a wrap + side for less than $10 and they will both be huge! The side portions of greek salads are gigantic and the greek fries come with lots of feta cheese. The pork souvlaki wrap is stuffed with french fries which is far better than delivering an empty-feeling wrap."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS DELICIOUS over the top hearty, filling fare and truly authentic Greek styles at very reasonable prices. I ended up going in during the bustling lunch rush with a line-up to the door that moved surprisingly fast and was well worth the 10-15 minute wait. Nothing fancy atmosphere-wise but the simplicity was fine given the deliciousness of the food. I had the chicken gyros pita at $5.53 that was almost a meal for two. The plates around $9.00 could definitely feed two on a budget. The warm and crispy pita was stuffed with hand-cut meat, tomatoes, onions, garlic tzatziki sauce AND fries! They also have a veggie pita for only $3.50 which I plan on trying next time I'm in the Young/Eglinton hood (not often, but might be worth a trip soon just for the Greek fix...)."}
{"text":"After seeing the picture of the Greek fries, I knew I had to try this place. I've been to their Danforth location, but it was so long ago and it was after a night of partying..that I had to make sure everything tasted as good as I remembered! 

The location at yonge and eglinton is pretty easy to find, however it is practically impossible to find a parking spot anywhere near the place in the evening. I was so hungry that after 30 minutes of circling the streets, I decided to give up and park inside the yonge and eglinton mall underground.

Once inside, we ordered one chicken and one lamb gyros sandwich, along with the Greek fries. The sandwiches looked so filled and so yummy, that we bit into them right away. Well, we were both unfortunately disappointed. The veal was full of fat and I barely tasted any meat, however the tzatziki sauce with the tomatoes and onions were good. Not much of a sandwich though.. The chicken was tasteless and once again, the sauce was the only thing saving it. We ended up throwing away half of our sandwiches. 

The Greek fries are a different story and the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. Although quite greasy, I have a soft spot for anything that has feta involved in its preparation. I gobbled those down pretty fast, because I was still so hungry! 

Overall, the place is easy to find and was pretty packed for a Monday evening. The meat isn't done the way it should be. It was more shawarma than gyros and even then, I would have preferred shawarma. I wouldn't come back unless I had a major craving for some oily Greek fries."}
{"text":"Idk why i haven't written a review for this place as i'm always coming here for my gyros sandwich.

Definitely smaller than the main branch in Danforth. Orders are made at the counter and it is also where they are picked up by the customers.

Iv only eaten the gyros sandwichs with feta fries. The food is definitely delicious coming hot from the stand and when paired with the feta fries it is really filling

If anything I Idon't really like the smell of the place? Maybe its just me.

Also if your have an extra wrap and place it in the fridge, be sure to heat well after coz the tast definitely is affected when eaten cold."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original location. The meat doesn't seem as fresh. For the most part though, same or similar flavor. I'd come back when hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Since moving to Young & Eglinton my fiancée and I have eaten at Messini more than anywhere else. The simple fact is that the quantity and quality of the food is awesome and unbeatable for such a crazy-low price. 
For only $5.00 you can get a huge gyro packed with big chunks of meat (chicken, pork, or lamb), onions, fries and tzatziki. It's just cheap, greasy, tasty goodness. 
There is plenty of seating available but I prefer to get it to go and enjoy my deliciously messy Messini experience at home."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and it was a big plate filled with tons of rice, salad, and a big skewer of chicken. I also ordered a drink. It was a decent amount of food for around $15 but not exactly a bargain, either.

The person who took my order was completely uninterested in being there, or being helpful, or friendly. Whatever, she took my order and gave me proper change, so I guess that's sufficient.

Food was tasty. That was the best part. I really took my time with the food just because the chicken was so juicy and tender and flavourful. 

I would come here again."}
{"text":"I came all the way from Mississauga and I'm glad I did. The food was delicious. It was quick and delicious and the price was right. It's a casual atmosphere and that's fine with me evacuee you won't be able to find their prices anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Messini on the Danforth. So I was disappointed by this location. We got two Gyro Dinner Plates for takeout: the chicken ($15.50) and Lamb ($18.)  They came with a side of potato/rice/fries and salad (nice salad of cucumber, tomato and good quality feta cheese.) The portions were fairly generous. The meat tasted OK, but it was not stellar. For starters, it was missing a lot of flavour. Also, it was dry. Overall, the quality wasn't there. Still, it's not a bad option when you need a quick fix for your craving for street meat."}
{"text":"The best deal and value for a healthy lamb, pork or chicken gyros. I like mine without fries inside to keep it healthy. One is more than enough as it is quite a generous portion. The establishment is impressive and they do go out of their way to please you. I am a loyal customer and have found only one other spot that is as good however it is a beef gyros. A family of 4 can eat and leave the door for under $30 dollars including tax. I honestly feel that anyone that has a bad word to say about this place could never be satisfied especially when you take everything into account."}
{"text":"I decided to give Messini another chance, and I'm glad I did! The meat is now tender, dishes are well seasoned, and the restaurant is much better organized in general. Service is still a tad slow, but nothing unforgiveable. Plus, their prices are quite reasonable considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I wasn't happy with my chicken pita.  I felt like the meat was well under-cooked.  I won't go back there."}
{"text":"This place has always been my go to place after a night out on the town. Well not this location the location on the Danforth. I came across this location one night while in the area and was super excited. My dance partner and I went down there after practice one night and I have to say it's exactly what I expected. The portion was HUGE and yes they put the fries in the wrap like they do everywhere in Greece. Brings me back to my holiday days.

I decided to order the half chicken and half pork gyros wrap and it was awesome. The flavours were great and loaded with the all the right amount of fixings. I really was taken back by the service from the lady at the check out counter. She wasn't the friendliest and actually seemed annoyed I was there ordering. What will keep me going back would be the food. The place is decorated in a basic way and more like a fast food joint with a lot of tables. The floor was messy as well which I didn't like but like i said before the FOOD was top notch.. 

Every time I go there I end up ordering the same thing. I should really try some other things on the menu. Maybe the next time i'm in the mood for Greek i'll head there for a different meal but one thing for sure is I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was authentic. Service was similar to fast food where you order and you get it in a little over a few minutes. 

This location is smaller but still gives the authentic greek experience.

Will be back"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the lack of flavor. Not to mention the chicken bone a nearly broke a tooth on. Should call the salad a cucumber salad, as that is pretty much all you get."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stumbled upon Messini. I didn't even know they had a branch here, but it was a pleasant surprise! I ordered the lamb gyros in a pita, and thought it was great. The lamb was perfectly gamey and tender - soft, but not too soft - the pita had a nice texture to it, and the fries inside brought the gyros pita together. It was $6, and the size was pretty generous. For the flavor and size, I'd say it was a steal.

Other than that, you order and pay at the front, get your food, and sit down to eat, or take it to go. There's not much service, so it's a good option if you just want to eat quickly and be on your way."}
{"text":"If you are used to the original on the Danforth then you will be disappointed. If it is your first time to a Messini then know that the Danforth location has table service and tastier food. Our Messini salad at this location was no where near what the one is on the Danforth. Would I go again, sure if I was in the area, otherwise if I was driving I'd make the effort to head to the Danforth location."}
