{"text":"Please note that this rating is a very personal one based entirely on the very good Cantonese-style chicken with black bean sauce and green pepper on rice, which is my go-to comfort food. This place served a huge portion, for a low price, and prepared exactly how I like it. Exactly. So tasty! For some reason I've had a very difficult time finding a nice black bean sauce on the west side of Toronto prepared in the manner that is nearly ubiquitous at Cantonese restaurants in Vancouver. Thanks, other GTA restaurants, but I don't actually want chilis in my black bean sauce. Since I haven't tried any other dishes at this restaurant, I'm probably out of line giving it 5 stars, but I am just so incredibly happy to finally find a place that prepares this dish well, after literally dozens of disappointments."}
{"text":"Overall I like the place! Food is good, very consistent, I've been there more times than I can count with my fingers. Price is great, I don't think you can get more food for your money. I don't like that they only take cash, washrooms could be newer, decor could be more inviting, but I go there for the food, it's good!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty standard Chinese affair.  For takeout, it's not bad and they give a sufficient portion, but don't expect them to knock your socks off with service, experience, or anything else.  I actually have a pretty bad bias against this place - many years ago when I was but a highschool lad, I came here with a few of my friends after a tiring game of street hockey.  We spoke in English, and ordered quite a few dishes including Dow Mew - not a cheap plate of veggies!  It took them an incredibly long time to cook the food, and we actually overhead them speaking in Cantonese about how we \"were just kids\" and \"there was no need to rush\".  Needless to say, we were pretty dissatisfied and boycotted the place for half a decade.  That aside, the food isn't bad at all - although it does tend to be a bit greasy ala most Chinese restaurants of the same ilk.  The place is rather small and they really try to pack as many ppl as they can, so eating a meal there can be somewhat of a harrowing experience.    If you're getting takeout, I would highly suggest ordering in advance as there is not much room to wait for your food.  Must-try foods include the XO-sauce fried turnip cake, and a the \"tossed soup noodle\" that must be eaten in (taking it home just doesnt' have the same effect - I actually don't know the real name for this, but it essentially arrives as ingredients in a bowl and soup in a different bowl, and you mash it together and eat it while it's piping hot)."}
{"text":"My father-in-law and the Mr. love this place!  It's decent Cantonese food for great prices.  The portions are huge, and like Jennifer said, dinner for two is really a dinner for four.    Deluxe Noodle receives four stars instead of five because being Caucasian, they gave us fortune cookies instead of the traditional oranges for dessert like the rest of the restaurant, which bothered me.  (Maybe if they had asked, I'd be less bothered.)  I had promised our friend (fresh home from Beijing) some decent  and authentic Cantonese food and just felt a little disappointed that we were judged.  It receives three stars instead of four because there aren't many vegetarian options, and obviously that's a bigger deal for me."}
{"text":"I always thought the food here was decent, but after reading Karen X's review, I now know why the food never settled well with my stomach. Reviews like those definitely turn me off from restaurants and it seems I won't be coming back here next time. Sad, I kinda liked their noodles too.  Still, if you still insist on eating here, here's a few quick things I'll say...  Portions will fill you. Waiter service is so-so.  Cash only.  Big parking lot."}
{"text":"I've never felt the motivation to actually write a cautionary review. My family has frequented this restaurant for several years. The food here is not bad and service has never been stellar but I think there are new owners and the service is astonishingly poor. When ordering over the phone the lady said my order cost $67 but when I arrive she says it's $77. Pointing to the receipt that says \"$77,\" she says \"see sixty-seven\". Whatever, I'll pay what it is. When I ask for hot sauce she puts a SINGLE packet in the bag. When I ask for more since my whole family needs to eat and since I've just paid for nearly $80 worth of food, she throws in another SINGLE packet. This was ridiculous. They seem to not want business. Don't give it to them."}
{"text":"Great food and price. Free range chicken (yellow - asian chicken not white people chicken) is good but over priced.  New owners at deluxe noodle and sign is now yellow.  I like the grouper with tofu hot pot, lobster spicy or with maggi, snow plea leafs with mushroom, soy chicken, chili chicken, shrimp wonton noodles, soft tofu dessert."}
{"text":"Dinner for 2 for $28. It's more like dinner for 4!   You get 2 soups (wonton, hot and sour, chicken corn), 2 spring rolls (filled with chinese mushrooms, cabbage and pork), 2 main dishes (a long list of  Chinese mainstays) and Yeung Chow fried rice.   Food is good and predictable. But predictable in a good way. We go here a lot because we know what to expect. Efficient staff, fast service, good and basic food. We leave with our bellies satisfied and our wallets not that much lighter.   Breakout dishes? Deep Fried Spicy Squid and Beef with Rice Noodles with X.O. Sauce.   It's cash only here and it gets busy during the weekend. Never stops me though."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this place! This place has no ethics! My husband ordered a noodle dish once and he caught the chef picking up the noodles from the floor after he dropped it by accident! the disgusting floor!! He was shocked and told the waitress to cancel the order! We haven't been back since. The place has ok Chinese food, but we will never trust them again!"}
