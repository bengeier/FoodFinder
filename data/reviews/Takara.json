{"text":"Delicious sushi, Naruto roll is my favorite. Dining room a bit cramped with limited space between tables"}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff, friendly chef, great food, large and innovative selection of sushi ! The location is great too with ample parking. :)"}
{"text":"Clearly in Wisconsin, people are devoid of taste and knowing what qualifies as good food. Or is it that they've been under-exposed to anything beyond Steak and potatoes? Oh, and alcohol?  I love Asian food. I love experimenting. What I don't love is bland crap and getting skimped out on. This is the first and last time I will buy food from Takara.   I ordered to go. It was Beef Udon, it had 9 pieces of 1/4 in. strips of over-cooked beef and the udon was over-boiled. To top it off, the dish was bland. There was no flavor, but this wasn't much of a surprise to me since I had already tasted the alleged Miso soup. It tasted like soapy dirty dishwater and yet somehow still managed to be bland?? How does that happen? In the bottom of my 'Miso' soup were 10-15 teeny-tiny fairy sized pieces of tofu and some withered green scallion. My roomie ordered clear soup, which I tasted and except for the fact that it was brown, it was clear alright..clear of taste! Once again, bland. WTF?!?  They gave us a side salad, there was 1 cucumber and 1 quarter of a tomato, both were sour as if it had sat around. The lettuce had brown lines in it. So obviously bad. O.o Do they have eyes? Why give a customer brown lettuce? Because I wasn't dining in, so they give me crap?  Did they hire their cousins? Do the 'chefs' even know how to cook? I'm not even Asian and I've made better Miso soup. I have had better and just as a tip to anyone who reads this....you can too. If you go somewhere else.   I'm pulling their Japanese card.  If it was, Japan is weeping right now and causing a new Tsunami, cause Takara served such stinky food in their name....  **Oh and their poor humongous Goldfish needs a tank cleaning!!! When I saw him gasping for breath I should've ran then. Clean that tank."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. We've tried their special rolls such as candy cane and norway, plus a number of nigiri. Very good, flavorful, with the right amount of spicy kick. Even my husband, who grew up on sushi and openly admits he dislikes sushi, loves their Tempura rolls."}
{"text":"Very fresh salmon sashimi. Spicy tuna roll was big and flavorful. Good service and decent prices."}
{"text":"Authentic japanese resto. Had some good shots like gyoza and short ribs but wasnt fan of the soba . Cool placr after all"}
{"text":"Takara is an excellent option for a sushiphiles looking for good Sushi in the Madtown area.  Coming from Chicago, I have been spoiled by an overabundance of cheap, yet excellent, sushi restaurants.  Whenever I come home to Madison and have a craving for Sushi, I've found that there are very few options that meet my standards.  Takara is a simple, yet tasty, destination  to satisfy your sushi fix.  You won't be blown away but fancy rolls featuring exotic deep fried fare.  Takara offers fresh staple items for an incredibly reasonable price.  Take advantage of their cheap lunch specials.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As someone who eats sushi regularly, I regard this restuarant as one of the best.  It has only been open for 3 months.  The owner is very nice and the staff very friendly.  We tried their special rolls on recommendation of the waitress, Norway and Crazy Salmon.  The Crazy Salmon was especially tasty.  Their sashimi (we tried the red tuna) was melt-in-your-mouth tender and fresh.  The quality of the sushi at this restaurant was fantastic.  The price is decent for a sushi restaurant, but they don't have combo deals.  Everything is priced out separately, including miso soup, edamame, and small salad."}
{"text":"Takara is one of the worst sushi/sashimi restaurants in town. Not only was the food disappointing, but the ambiance was rather lackluster, with cheesy 80s muzak playing in the background. The biggest annoyance were the prices; without question, you are not paying for the quality of the food, but rather for the high rent the owners are forced to pay at Les Cours Mont Royal.     I cannot comment on the entire menu, but I can comment on the dishes that my friend and I ordered: 1. Seaweed salad: rather bland with a thick tasteless \"ginger\" dressing on the side. 2. Soup (don't remember the name): the taste  of the buckwheat noodles and a single tempura shrimp in broth was actually not bad, although not worth the price.  2. Sashimi: too thin and poorly sliced with a few bones here and there. Some of the pieces looked as if they were torn off of the fish -- which goes against traditional the Japanese art of food preparation . 3. Hand roll: fell apart upon carefully picking it up. 4. Green tea: tasted like the cast iron pot. 5. sake: well, can't go wrong here (thank goodness)   If you want to pay the same high prices, I would suggest  Zenya, located near La Baie -- it's less traditional, but you'll pay the same price for better ambiance and delicious, well prepared Japanese cuisine.  If you\"re not limited to the downtown core, Maiko on Bernard and Mikado on Avenue Laurier are also very tasty."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the hibachi. It was just ok. They don't serve the dipping sauces like other hibachi restaurants. The shrimp still had the tails on them. The food was very bland. The service was good, nothing great. Maybe next time I would try the sushi !"}
{"text":"Great prices + large rolls + excellent service = success"}
{"text":"New Japanese restaurant/Sushi Bar in Gilbert, in the strip mall on souteast corner of Val Vista and Elliot, next to Al's Hot dogs.  Had dinner there on 1/23/09. We had 5 sushi rolls, which were excellent. They have a very large variety of sushi, and this was some of the freshest sushi I have ever ate. Also had some very good chicken lettuce wraps. The short ribs are mouth watering, tender goodness."}
{"text":"Terrible. I visited here yesterday dinner and the restaurant was really really hot and there were lots of fly insects around the drink, sushi, and every dishes. It was really terrible experience. We complained to the manager about this and he said that the owner already knew that there are lots of complains about air conditioning and fly but he doesn't take care of these.  I couldn't finish any dishes and drink because of gross fly and I should've covered the chopstick and drink with napkins. The worst sushi restaurant. I have no idea where many fly insects coming out."}
{"text":"Takara has become a regular in our rotation.  The fish is just so fresh.  Whatever I thought of the soy sauce in my earlier review simply isn't an issue anymore.  The food is just really good.    The atmosphere isn't as hip and sophisticated as Murimoto - but the fish is as good  or better and really nicely garnished.  Seaweed salad is really nice.    Service still isn't stellar - but I'll concede that in exchange for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Good for eat-in or takeout.  Fresh tasting fish, great presentation and friendly service.   A lot of other comments use the Wisconsin qualifier with Takara, but honestly in it's price range I think Takara could compete in larger cities like NYC."}
{"text":"Bad experienced. Too many fly insects in restaurant and manager also not care at all. Worst restaurant in Madison. Yak!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is attentive, but the quality of the food doesn't match the dedication of the staff. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I go to Takara at least once a week.  I'm addicted and every time the food is consistent and fresh!  Even on Sundays!  I love them."}
{"text":"Overpriced... I got the tsubaki sashimi which comes with 14 pieces for $22. You'd think that they'd give you thicker pieces of fish for that price (my meal was almost $30 after tax and tip). They decorate the plate with lots of shredded carrot and prop the fish up on lemon slices to make it seem more substantial but these sashimi slices were probably the thinnest I've ever seen. It came with 2 pieces of tamago (egg), 3 octopus, 3 red tuna, 3 sea bass(?), 4 pieces of salmon. So not the most special sashimi either. Sure, I guess they gave me an extra piece, but it was so thin I don't think it counts. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I often get take-out sushi or dine here for lunch, and we've never been disappointed.  Some of the rolls we've tried include spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy scallop, mexican roll, active volcano, naruto, veggie tempura, and many others . My all-time favorite is the crunchy shrimp roll----deep fried shrimp, avocado, drizzled with a sweet sauce and it has a spicy kick to it!  YUM!  The fish is always fresh, never chewy or \"fishy\", which I'm always afraid of when trying new places for raw fish in the midwest.    I highly recommend Takara!"}
{"text":"Carry out is advisable!...the sushi here is decent enough (by Madison standards), but the wait staff is just awful. I typically orde on-line for carry out but recently decided to dine in. Our waitress seemed to be living in another dimension. No enthusiasms or warmth or basic courtesy towards us. Kind of tossed out menus at us & walked away. When we place our sushi order, she questioned whether it would be enough food for us. We weren't 100% sure so she said she'd leave one menu at our table just in case. As she was strolling by in a daze about 5 minutes later, she stopped & picked up our menu. She spilled a small bowl of soy sauce while clearing our table & said absolutely nothing. Wandered away so we then attempted to clean her mess. Then she ambled over a minute later with a rag to wipe her spill, but still never said anything to us. I can only assume she is working at Takara to support her drug habit. Carry out is the way to go with this place."}
{"text":"I have dined here numerous times. My family really likes this place. It's not too pricey like muramoto (although, I adore that place), and it's not a chinese-sushi-place.  However, there is ALOT of room for improvement. The staff needs to provide better service. They are slow and, sometimes, rude. The rice for the sushi is not sticky enough sometimes, so when I pick it up, it sometimes crumble into halves.  I love their lunch menus, but I would not recommend dinner enthusiastically."}
{"text":"*I highly recommend picking up sushi at Hyvee across the street instead or dining elsewhere.*  If you would like to eat sub par sushi and receive terrible customer service look no further. I have given this place several tries over the years. Each time has disappointed. However, my take out experience this past Friday was terrible. When I first entered the restaurant it was evident this place is completely unorganized and chaotic. I barely had enough time to tell the stressed out hostess my name for pick up before she said it was not ready yet and started walking away. I tried asking her if she knew how much longer it might be and she just said she didn't know and left toward the kitchen. As other guests arrived to dine in they were either initially ignored or hurriedly led to a table, no pleasantries or customer service here.   So I waited for some time and then attempted to \"flag down\" another employee to ask about the status of my order. At this place the best you can do to receive service is \"flag down\" (unfriendly) employees. I was then told by the employee that she didn't know when it would be ready and that I should leave and come back later. Not sure what she meant by this, as I was given no time frame as to when to come back. It literally sounded as though she recommended I go home and come back at some point? At this time it had been over a half an hour since the order was placed. Another lady who was also waiting for her pick up order said she had already been waiting 45 minutes and that she was becoming frustrated about her experience.   At this point, I was increasingly disappointed that I ordered from here and tried to \"flag down\" another employee to ask about my order. I was truly ready to leave and pick up Sushi across the street at Hyvee. The next employee told me to come back in five to ten minutes. So I went back to my car and waited five more minutes then headed back into the restaurant. I walked up to the counter and the person behind the counter just ignored me. Eventually I tried to get her attention to which she let out the loudest sigh, it truly was bizarre and awkward and without hardly making eye contact she eventually asked me what my name was. She then handed me a bag of food and took my payment. As I was about to leave I thought something didn't seem right because the bag I was handed was small and hardly seemed like as much food as I had ordered. I stopped to double check and sure enough part of my order was missing. So I had to find someone again and ask them for the rest of my order. There were no apologies made ever throughout this entire visit, despite waiting close to 45 minutes for my take out order. The food itself wasn't even good. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm Japanese, so my expectation can be pretty high.  But I don't think this Takara on S. Whitney doesn't deserve \"Madison's favorites.\" Sushi is not fresh at all.  In fact, two out of two times we had sushi there, we got queasy. The bento box seems to be overpriced for its quantity and quality compared to other places.  The service is very mediocre."}
{"text":"My experience here was honestly awesome! The decor is kinda ehh whatever but the food was soooo good! We ordered a TON of food, two love boats and a few random rolls. It's like they gave us the extra mile because we put our trust in their hands! The sashimi was excellent also!"}
{"text":"First time to Takara and here's my take....  Decor - totally Japanese sushi house, including those personal rooms where you sit on the floor with a hole in the bottom for your feet.  Great for groups!   Service - slow, very slow.  Only two servers on a Saturday night ...so be prepared to wait for drinks, food and refills.   Sushi - YUM.  The fish was super fresh and had great flavor.  I got the sashimi platter.  It was also kind of a work of art when it came to the table.  I also noticed on the menu there were lots of options for rolls and other sushi platters.    Other food - Good.  The hubby got chicken teriyaki and he said it was pretty good.  It came out a little like chicken fajitas do at a mexican restaurant, so lots of steam on a skillet.    Cost - standard for a sushi joint.    Overall - work on the service!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Nice to have the Sunday Monday special of one fancy roll and a regular role for a dollar. Gyoza is always nice and hot. Staff is friendly and helpful. The food taste fresh and the preparation seems clean."}
{"text":"This was some of the best sushi I have ever had. I had the sushi and sashimi combo and the fish was all very delicious. The california roll had the crab salad instead of just the crab stick, which I love, and the salad has the tasty ginger dressing (yum!) The atmosphere is very cool and trendy, and it is impeccably clean. The hibachi fried rice was very flavorful and not dry at all, perhaps too many bean sprouts. The vegetable tempura was reasonably priced, however, the batter was thicker than what I am used to. There are no specials on Sunday so it was a little expensive, but the quality of the sushi and sashimi has made me a fan!"}
{"text":"I love Takara. It is my go-to place for decently priced sushi. I started going to Takara in college (the state street location) and now I get it at the Whitney Way location. I love the spicy maki combo. It always tastes amazing, comes with a choice of miso soup of ginger salad, and for $15.99 is so filling. An interesting side-note...when I went to the downtown location it was between the years of 1998-2000. Just recently (this year), I went in for carry-out to the Whitney Way location and the lady there said, \"hi, nice to see you again! You used to go to our restaurant on State Street, right?\" Um, yes...but over 15 years ago! Very impressed with her memory for faces! Wish I had it. :)"}
{"text":"Disturbing experience. I travel a lot and therefore have a corporate card I use for meals. Spent close to $45 on sushi. I didn't leave a tip because I'm one who believes tips must be earned not automatically given, and the service and food was not great, and also since I'm using a corporate card I cannot tip using it per company policy. Here is the disturbing experience, after I paid and left to my rental car the server literally ran out with the bill and started demanding I leave a 20% tip! I was shocked at her tone and demeanor. She went on and on about how tipping is required in all restaurants in the country! As someone who travels for work and dines in restaurants 15 to 20 times each month I didn't know whether to laugh or snap at her for her stupidity thinking I'm going to believe what she just claimed. I told her the service was not deserving of a tip plus I'm using a corporate card. She couldn't not grasp what I was telling her. All the while she kept demanding I tip her 20%. I told her I'm going to file a complaint with the BBB. She ended up going back in after I told her she's wasting her time. Only stupid people think tips are required whether service is bad or good."}
{"text":"Food is always great--noodles, sushi, bento boxes, it doesn't matter.   Service, especially when picking up an order you've called in or done online, quick frankly sucks. Expect it to take at least 5, if not 15 minutes after the promised by time."}
{"text":"I've come here with friends who enjoy Takara because it's close.  I was a little hesitant at first being in a strip mall (like Ginza of Tokyo), but because it's Madison and strip malls are prevalent, gave it the benefit of the doubt.  It's smaller but has a large number of close tables, and a sushi bar.  You don't really feel any kind of privacy because the tables are on top of one another.  I don't know if they have a teppinyaki area in the back of the restaurant... The sushi and the nigiri I had was actually very good.  They don't skimp on the fish and I thought the quality, while not totally fresh, was still good for Madison.  And they do a great job with presentation!  The service is pleasant and met with a smile.    Definitely recommend if you're on the west side of town."}
{"text":"I've got one word for you: Yum!  A recent dinner here was a major hit.  I had the sashimi plate (12 pieces for $20...not bad at all) and a dragon roll, and it was delicious.  I can be a bit picky about my sashimi, but this was beautifully and generously cut, with several pieces of amazing tuna and salmon alongside the ubiquitous octopus.  I somehow missed a piece that was disguised as a garnish, but our waiter pointed it out when he cleared my plate so I could snap it up.  My roll was a perfect size too, not too small but not so obnoxiously large that I couldn't eat it in one bite.  My sister eats gluten-free, which was easily accommodated -- they brought her a different bottle of soy sauce, and our server went so far as to mention to her not to try my roll, since it had gluten in it.  Our request for how to split up the rolls between several plates was also handled correctly.  A few minor, minor items: I don't quite understand why my sashimi plate came with a bowl of (warm) rice.  Never seen that before, and if I'd wanted rice, I would have ordered chirashi.  It was easy to set to the side and ignore though, so no big deal.  Also, soda is canned (no fountain, I guess), but they brought me a glass of ice and even poured for me.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is not large, but at 7:30 on a Saturday we didn't have a problem getting seated.  All in all, I'm a fan.  I'll definitely come back here for sushi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, amazing service, great atmosphere.  The prices are really good for sushi.  I enjoyed everything about my meal experience and so did the rest of my party.  I will be going back here every time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Great sushi.  What more could you ask for?  While I don't mind dining here in the evenings, you really cannot beat their lunch sushi special, where you can select either 2 or 3 rolls, along with soup or salad.  The price for the freshness really cannot be topped, in my opinion.  My very favorite is their vegetable tempura roll.  I really love the sweet potato in it. Though, I will say I have not met a sushi roll here I haven't liked yet!  Last week I stopped in about 5 minutes before they closed (yes, I know, I was THAT person....  But I really needed my Takara fix and I was ordering to go) and the staff was so pleasant and helpful.  I was 100% expecting them to be annoyed that I waited until the last minute to get there.  That was not the case at all.  I will try to manage my time better so as not to do that to them again, but I am forever grateful they still took my order and made my day.  I love recommending Takara and I will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish and attentive service. Food arrived quickly and the server was nice. Seemed to be busy for weekday lunch but it didn't effect timeliness in relation to getting our food."}
{"text":"Moving from California where I lived on the coast I did not expect to find fine Sushi in Arizona, honestly where would any restaurant get sashimi grade fish in the middle of a desert?  I still do not have an answer to that question but whoever orders for Takara knows where to get fresh fish.  I was shocked at the quality and the attention to detail that the chef (and I believe owner) paid to every roll he sent out to the dineing room.  I had taken my fiancee and her sister and boyfriend out for their fist sushi experience.  I was nervous I might ruin them at some sub par sushi joint, however from the moments we walked into Takara my nerves were being put to rest.    As we came in near close the chef enthusiastically greeted us from behind the sushi bar, we were seated promptly and a very nice young lady helped us through the menue.    Another young man delivered the rolls and was glad to point out things such as \"the tongue\" on the caterpillar roll, the chef had taken time to present each roll in a unique and entertaining way, giving antenna, eyes and a tongue to the caterpillar roll.  And this was no exception the Las Vegas roll (which I had never had) was incredible and a table favorite, the spicy tuna roll was superb.  I was also shocked when I received the bill, it was about half of what I would expect to pay, for the quality of ingredients, service and atmosphere there I would have GLADLY paid twice the amount!  It was clear to us that Takara is no corporate business but a family business with the whole family helping out, they sat at a table in the back enjoying each others company over dinner.  We were a bit of a rowdy group that night, but the staff at Takara wanted to have fun themselves, by the end of the night we had met most of the family from grandma all the way down to what may have been her great granddaughter.   We had more than dinner that night, we had a memorable experience and we all look forward to going back and seeing our new friends again soon."}
{"text":"Call me picky... I have never liked Takara. Many years ago we had a standing lunch meeting there and I finally refused to eat there anymore. A couple of days ago we went to Takara about 1:15 for lunch.  The restaurant was empty and the decor had never changed. A tired looking environment. I ordered rolls and my partner ordered a bowl. Both of our meals were tasteless. The service was unfriendly. They turned out the lights rather than politely reminding us that they were closing. I was surprised to see so many positive reviews. Maybe it's me."}
{"text":"I have been trying to think of a word that can best describe my experience last night at Takara.   Bad?  Yucky?  Disappointing?   No...I am going to go with CRAP!  To quote the Joker \"Where do we begin?\"  My wife and I decided we wanted Sushi on our anniversary but wanted a place on the west side and wanted to try something different than our norm.  So, after going to see Pirates 4 (Just an FYI...great movie) we stopped in at Takara and I knew from the moment I sat down this was going to be a mistake.  First: Our waiter was a complete moron who would mumble and would not listen to anything we said.  Second: The menu is a jumbled mess and confusing. Third: When you see more wait staff than patrons....instant trouble.  So, we decided to stay and try it despite the initial reaction and we split a Hibachi dinner (I was disappointed that did not have a Hibachi station so it was made in the back) and got three sushi rolls.  Here is where it gets confusing for the waiter...  1) Philadelphia Roll 2) Lobster Roll 3) Badger Roll but since my wife is ALLERGIC to crab can you substitute the crab with something else.  \"Of course we can.\"   So the rolls come out first and the Philly Roll was smokey and just tasted BAD, The lobster roll was huge and something was just not right.  Then...the Badger roll.  We both ate a piece and it was nothing to write home about at all.  When looking at the next piece we noticed that the LOBSTER that was supposed to be in it was substituted with shrimp.  Oh, and the crab that my wife is allergic to....yep...still on there.  Yeah....  When we confronted the waiter he told us \"that is what you told me\" and NO IT IS NOT! Why would I order a roll with lobster in it as the main ingredient and want shrimp instead when the allergy is for crab.  You sir are a idiot!  Oh, it gets better.  He then proceeded to explain how the crab was imitation crab and not real crab. First off, nice to know the fish was fresh and real.  Secondly, it does not matter since we said NO CRAB.  So, we waited for our non-hibachi hibachi dinner and the lobster was over done, the filet minion was tough and hard to eat and well....lets just get the check.  Summary?  Ok....waiter is a moron and the service sucked and I could have had better Sushi from a vending machine...in an airport."}
{"text":"Out of all of the Sushi places I have tried in the Madison area, Takara's is by far my favorite. My husband and I will take lunch here 1-2 times per month and almost every time we go we are very satisfied.   Pros: - Sushi preparation is almost always consistent even with different sushi chef's behind the counter. - Fish has a very good taste to it and it almost always cut very well - Lunch time prices are very reasonable for the quality - The simplest rolls are really good. My husband and I usually never get any of the fancy specials or complicated rolls because they do the simple stuff really well.  - The sushi chefs are very friendly and willing to chat!  Cons: - Waitresses often appear to be in a bad mood. It may be a cultural thing, but my husband and I always feel like we are a burden to the waitresses and hostess.  - Deco is a little dated - There is a minimum price to spend in order to sit in the \"private\" room on the floor....even if the place is empty and your group is the only one there - There is sometimes an off-putting smell in the front room  Overall: If you are in the sushi or sashimi without all the bells and whistles, this is the place to go. The food is very good and they seem to be able to provide consistent meals"}
{"text":"Sushi was as good as you can expect in Wisconsin. Service was acceptable, nothing terrible, but nothing outstanding. They have a nice location on State Street and it's never too crowded."}
{"text":"Takara is one of the few Japanese restaurants in Montreal operated by a Japanese chef. I've heard that he goes to the fish market and buys his seafood himself.   The first important thing to note about Takara is its location. The entrance is on the 4th floor eventhough they have a sign near the entrance on Peel.  The Japanese speaking hostess gave us one of the private rooms where you have to take off your shoes and sit with your legs in a hole. It makes it appear you are sitting on a tatami but it is wayyyyy more comfortable.  The sushi is well presented and as fresh as you can get in Montreal. Taste is also authentic. We ordered some fried tofu, miso soup, chawanmucshi (steamed egg), sashimi bowl, some sushi and a fish with soba dish."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh, and they had toro too! Server was new and English was bit of a challenge for her, but she made up for it with the level of attentiveness but at the time it was very slow (only 2 tables served).  I also found the udon bowls lacked in flavor and amount of broth. The price was midway: a specialty roll (dragon) avocado maki roll and a toro nigiri cost me about $25.  My colleagues went on a busier night, and their only complaint was the slowness for service and food. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but it certainly hits the craving."}
{"text":"Significant improvement from the last time I was here.  I do not know if the staff is different or finally on their game.  I came on my own accord to see if there was any disparity.  The negi hamachi roll had a slightly larger portion of fish.  The fish was of better quality than previously mentioned.  Tempura was crunchy and light, not greasy, dense, or soggy.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars this time was because the wasabi was runny and smeared over some of my rolls...and I don't know if this was a fluke.  I would, however, say I am quite pleased with the changes Takara has made."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi person. But my husband is and so is my sister. We came here with her on her recommendation and it was really great. I had the chicken tempura bento and it came with so so much food! It was all delicious. The others each had a 3 roll lunch special and enjoyed their various selections. The service was really friendly and I thought it was really sweet that one of the waitresses recognized my sister and asked about my niece (who often comes here with her). Clearly they appreciate their customers and enjoy making their experiences positive. A tasty meal indeed!"}
{"text":"It's OK. There are better options from sushi in the area if that's what you're looking for, though this place is may be a little cheaper. Service is mediocre and sometimes just plain slow/frustrating."}
{"text":"Good sushi--definitely frequent here for their lunch specials.  Any two rolls for 8.50 and any three rolls for 11.25 with soup or salad.  Service here is usually prompt.  Prefer this place from the State St. location because it's more easily accessible by car.  I'm not sure what's up with the mall here but for some reason the parking lot is always full, but beats the parking ramps downtown.  Had a few special dinners at this location where an abundance of sushi was ordered--definitely worth the price.  The spicy tuna roll is always killer here."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars. Food was good, service was friendly, but they were not handling the lunch time rush with any sort of grace. I'll try them again sometime, but will head out a little earlier.  Good tapioca for the smoothies!"}
{"text":"I ordered sushi/sashimi for pick up on a Tuesday night. I wouldn't think things should so busy, but apparently it was busy enough to have to wait a half an hour for pick up. Ok, easy enough, even though I only live 5 mins from the place.   I walk in right when I'm supposed to, and my food is sitting behind the counter. I pay, head home, and open it up to find that every single piece is as dry as a bone. The sashimi alternated between chewy and so dried out that it was inedible. I think I only ended up eating three of my 8 pieces before giving up. The sushi roll was decent, although nothing to brag about.  Over all, I paid $20 for a mediocre sushi roll and three pieces of barely edible fish. Find somewhere else, even if it is a little less convenient."}
{"text":"I've been coming for the lunch specials since I met my husband years ago. We even ordered sushi platters from the State St location (now closed) for our wedding.  Two rolls and a soup/salad for $9.95 or three rolls and soup/salad for $12.95 is the best deal in this area.  There is good selection of rolls to choose from.  One of our favorites is the New York roll. We try to get here before or right at noon to get the fastest service. Fridays are the busiest and loudest days. On cold days, the udon soup with tempura shrimp is also a favorite.   We've seen sushi chefs and servers come and go over the years. Quality has been the same with slight variations in ingredients for some rolls.  All staff have been very pleasant and it is sad when they seem to disappear after a season of working there.   We continue to be regular patrons and enjoy coming here at least 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"I like it. That should be enough ;-)  Takara has been around for a while (it may have changed ownership in recent years, however) and is located in Les Cours Mont-Royal. Frankly, it's prety well hidden so if you don't already know it's there, you likely won't stumble upon it by accident. It's fairly spacious and has private rooms for small groups; there's a hole right under the tables so you give off the illusion of sitting on a tatami but you're not. Sneaky!   I've only stopped in for lunches, and have had good experiences each time. The fish is fresh, the presentation is good and prices are very reasonable. You can order à la carte, or go for one of their Bento boxes, which include a variey of rolls and other tasty items.   It's usually pretty busy at lunch so get there early or call ahead to book a table."}
{"text":"Takara is the sushi place I go to in Madison when I don't want to spend my whole paycheck! I have been very pleased with their lunch specials and their staff is always friendly. I also love the 90's music they play!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, again eh service. Gluten-free soy sauce which is nice."}
{"text":"I was first one in the door for lunch the other day. I had eaten here several times before and had been satisfied, but this visit was sub par.  I asked to sit at sushi bar and got the nod. When seated it took a good 10 minutes before a waiter arrived to take my order. I said I'd like a menu. Duh. The menu had changed slightly, but I went with my usual  sashimi lunch. I also asked for hot tea and took the soup over the salad. Once he delivered my tea and soup, he disappeared  until I asked for the check.   While my plate looked beautiful, it was not very good to eat. The sashimi was just big chunks of tuna, white tuna, salmon, and a clam. I have has sashimi cut in several different ways and this was the worst. The tuna was very chilled and even a bit frozen in parts. The salmon was a bit fishy and the clam was tasteless. The white tuna was okay. The waiter never brought my rice, which ticked me off, but I just wanted to get out of there.   With better sushi restaurants in the area, this will be my last time at Takara."}
{"text":"Bad service; have to beg to get your order taken. The food was about a 6 out of 10. Good but definitely not great. The thing that grossed me out was the bugs! They were everywhere. I even noticed fly strips hanging in the kitchen (I peeked through a window) and that just really grossed me out."}
{"text":"My family has been patrons of Takara West for years.  We've always found the fish  fresh (raw - salmon, tuna, snapper, etc.) and the service great.  The only thing bad I can say about this place is that they use imitation crab meat (thumbs down) and sometimes it can take a while to get your food.  But let's give the chefs a break, they're artists after all ;-)  We've made the mistake of introducing our children to sushi at very young ages.  They now crave sushi and demand it once a week, which might go without saying, is not easy on our wallets.  That being said, the staff always makes an effort to stop by our table (even those not waiting on us) to interact with our children.    Occasionally, the chefs will assemble our meal on boats to appease the kids, which is a nice touch.  Check out my pic for our latest ensemble.  The presentation was perfect.  The fish was fresh.  The kids were happy.  We were happy.  Thanks, Takara!  Oh, how could I forget, their lunch special is a STEAL!.  3 rolls and a cup of miso soup for $12.99!"}
{"text":"Update: I tried this place again. Same service issues. Bless their hearts but I'm done with this place. I can get this food elsewhere in Madison.  ---------------  Let me start with some positives. The food is pretty good. The tonkatsu is really good. Though it's hard to mess up. The sushi rolls are alright but I wouldn't make it my go to sushi restaurant. There are better options in Madison. I really want to try the hibachi options next.  This would usually get a restaurant four stars. But where they totally failed me last time was service. Waitresses were actively ignoring me as I tried to get their attention. Unbelievable. When I finally got one to pay attention and made a point about it, this was corrected and service was much better.  Their food is not good enough to make up for bad service. Hopefully they can do better when I try this place again."}
{"text":"This is another place I thought to check out with my Japanese mother. Atmosphere was nice except for the fact,they had some Chinese ish artifacts and the wait staff wore Chinese uniforms. The sushi staff were dressed like Japanese Sushi chefs. Waitress was slow even they were not busy. Never did refill our tea or water. Miso soup was just ok,better then that instant tasting one. I can't even remember what we ordered because it was so bad,I mentally blocked it out and left a mental note never to go back there again.  Well at least,they have good taste in their private rooms and their Sushi chef's uniforms. I guess this is a place for people who will never get to experence the real Japanese food. I'd rather cook my self. Come to my house,I'll cook you up some REAL Japanese food. I'll even get my mom or husband to roll up some Sushi for you too."}
{"text":"Takara is a pleasant, somewhat modern-designed restaurant in a strip mall that achieves more than its location would suggest. Inside, traditional meets modern with an L-shaped sushi bar in the back corner, a rectangular liquor bar that is gently lit, and tables scattered about the interior. There are a few private rooms with sliding doors that look to be a great spot to share some time with close friends. Ceilings are high, the tables and floors are light to natural in finish, and lines simple. Fairly traditional, and that's a good thing to me.  Now, I am going to contrast my review against Christie L's reviews, because we are two different people when it comes to sushi. She seems to enjoy rolls, options and creativity. I prefer pure expressions of simplicity and tradition, where I can taste the individual nuance of each piece of nigiri and precisely taste the fish. Take what you will from each of our reviews.  According to the Japanese, you can judge a sushi place based on their tamago. Hence, I always get one and eat that first. It's different everywhere you go. Here, it was a fascinating and unusual presentation with the tamago split and formed around the rice. However, there was a little browning on it -- a big no-no when scrambling egg.. The flavor was a little eggy in nature, like an improper custard. It was all right, but nothing I would consider to be a definitive expression of the establishment. This I would not order again.  The remainder of the nigiri were mostly above average. The saba was oily, rich, and faintly fishy in that way that reminds you that yes, you are indeed eating mackerel, but it does not overpower you. It was very, very good. The salmon lived up to its appearance and was tender and well-flavored as evidenced by its thick chevrons of fat. Tako was above average in quality and cut on an extreme bias, which was quite pleasing to the eye. The unagi was overly sauced and too sweet, but still was tasty..just not ideal. The hamachi was a little overpowered by its wasabi and earned a shrug from me -- they were either covering for something or thought I wanted it that way. Snapper, on the other hand, was good.  For a roll, I consider myself something of a futomaki aficionado. I love the big fat roll with the vegetables, gourd, pickles and perhaps some steamed crab or raw tuna. It's different everywhere, and the futomaki here is good. It has avocado in it and that's not my thing, but I would certainly order it again.  Decor was simple and pleasant, as it should be. The small private rooms would be a great place to enjoy with friends or family for a special occasion or small, intimate event and I plan to take advantage of them the next time my brothers are in town. There's a great chandelier that I have added a photo of. It's a lovey feature in the place and should be highlighted, as I've seen nothing like it before.  My only real complaint was that I was server by a waiter despite sitting at the sushi bar. I would have appreciated the chance to have the chef prepare what he thought was best and go piece by piece, but that's a no go, apparently. C'est la vie.  All in all, I recommend Takara and plan to return. The fish was good and ambiance pleasant, even if the service was a little weird to me. Overall it was a good experience and I think is's a solid 3 stars here at Yelp."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for Takara but our dinner here still fell short. We came here with my in-laws because they like the food here, and while most of it wasn't TOO bad, the service left a lot to be desired.  We ordered one sukiyaki, two chicken teriyaki bento boxes, and a few rolls. I didn't try the sukiyaki but it looked pretty good, with lots of vegetables and different proteins on top. My FIL finished it pretty quickly.  The bento boxes come with assorted tempura, shumai (of the frozen variety...), rice, and your choice of sushi or sashimi (assorted 4pc). The chicken wasn't bad, about 1/3-1/2 a small chicken breast portion. The tempura was very crispy and delicious as tempura usually is. The shumai was awful, watery and mushy, the box would be better off if they tossed that and included salad or something. Each box also gets a miso soup. Unfortunately, ours came out with a rather sour taste to it and we notified our server, who shrugged it off, said he doesn't know why, didn't apologize or offer a replacement, and took our soups away. Oookay...  At some point, I waved the server down to ask for a plate to share the bento box with my husband and he brought tiny plates that I couldn't even fit the tempura on, and crumbs were flying everywhere.   For rolls, we had the Shogun Roll, some form of a Dragon Roll or other (salmon on top, eel and avocado inside), and a toro negi. The shogun was the best of the three rolls mostly due to the shrimp tempura inside. The salmon on top of the dragon roll was flavorless and a little dry, and the eel inside was cold.   After we received our entrees and extra plates, our server more or less disappeared for the rest of the meal. We sat around waiting for a while until I got up to find someone so we could get our check, to the seeming displeasure of the two lady employees chatting near the now-empty sushi bar.   This seems to be a Chinese run Japanese restaurant, so I wouldn't expect more than the level of service you receive in your average Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the spicy white fish with Shiso roll, New York roll, and many others. Great lunch specials. Rice texture is perfect, and ingredients are fresh. I am sorry they closed the downtown location on State Street."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant on Whitney. They have fresh sashimi available in multiple sizes, and the quality is good for the price. They have great special rolls, and tempura is also very good. Great Japanese restaurant that gives you what you want and crave when you think you want the American Japanese food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Madison. Most recently went with a group of 8. We sat in the large semi-private booth with plenty of room to spare. Sushi here has never disappointed us. Good variety of choices for non-sushi lovers as well."}
{"text":"This place has probably the best sushi in Madison.  I'm always pleasantly surprised by the different menu items, and their fish tastes very fresh.  They offer several little add-ons which provide a value.  The rolls are enormous, and sashimi is very generous.  Love the shogun roll.  Really good."}
{"text":"Service and food both great! I came in with a party of people and Tina was the only waitress there. She did an amazing job!!! She deserves 5 stars herself. The food was brought out in a timely manner, she accommodated all of our orders and she was so pleasant!"}
{"text":"4.99 Tuna Sashimi  2.99 Spicy Salmon  0.62 Tax  ------ 8.60 Dinner   I only paid $10 for dinner, but it was only worth $10. The spicy salmon roll had too much mayonnaise. The maguro (tuna) sashimi was cut from the last pathetic piece of fish in the bar, instead of a large cut of tuna, like I prefer. The sushi chef served the sashimi in a bowl of ice, to keep it fresh I guess. Unfortunately that made it slippery, and it almost spilled on me as he handed it over the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Ok, so tradition says that after each child my wife and I have we break our 9mo sushi fast with a monstrous sushi binge unlike any other. This year Takara was the place. Here are my thoughts.  Sushi Quality:  Superb. Everything was fresh and tasty. we didn't try everything but the spicy spider roll was outstanding. Also, the individually presented sushi was nicely done. The salmon tasted very good, and the tuna was outstanding.  Service: The service was good. In general all of the staff was very nice and we never wanted for anything.  Ambience: Others have commented on the ugliness of the strip mall this location is in, and they are right. BUT once inside it feels nice and comfortable and the atmosphere is sushi friendly.  Overall, an excellent re-introduction to sushi after a 9month hiatus."}
{"text":"We had a large party of 14 people on a business trip. Usually you might walk into a place with that many people and you get eye rolls or uncomfortable vibes from the staff. Not here!!! They were very accommodating! TINA was the waitress for all of us, and also most of the restaurant at a busy dinner time. We told her we needed separate checks, she and her manager were totally fine with that. We also didn't see sake bombs on the menu, but she ran it by her manager and they said they'd have no problem getting it together for us. Tina even made sure to guide us through the whole sake bomb experience for those of my coworkers who hadn't done it before, she was so awesome!!! Our food came out in a timely manner. We all came from California so I think we have pretty high expectations for sushi coming from the coast. We were all very happy with the food! The sushi was fresh tasting and delicious! There were no mistakes, and the bills all came out separate as requested. We were all so impressed with her and the service...many of us tipped on top of the already calculated gratuity.   I would definitely come back and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants some sushi. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"The service was alright. The food I thought was also so-so. Nothing too great but decent. I felt the ratio of meat to noodles in the yakisoba was not reasonable. There was way too much noodles.  Not too sure if I would come back here again. But I don't live too far so maybe I'll give it another go someday."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at the restaurant once.  The service was good and a nice atmosphere.    Since then I order takeout at least a couple times a week.  The lunch specials are impossible to turn down, $12 for 3 rolls and soup or salad.  The sushi is great, the best I've had in this price range, although I'm not a seasoned sushi expert."}
{"text":"Took my sister her in spite of her protestations she does not like Japanese food.  She had the tempura chicken and loved it, said it was even better the second day as left overs. I had the sashimi which was fresh tasty and half the cost I've paid most other places. I also had their Monday special where you buy one roll and get another roll for only $! more"}
{"text":"Food: Most of my experience is with their sushi, for which I'd recommend the Chirashi for good selection vs price.  The sushi is decently good, but it does tend to pale in comparison to places where fresh seafood is more easily found (Chicago, San Francisco).  The non-sushi selections (Tonkatsu, Tempura) are filling and about what you'd expect (i.e. not modified to suit Western tastes) but don' t particularly stand out.  Service: Generally relatively speedy.  Servers are attentive but not in-your-face.  Value: Reasonable prices, and portions fit the price.  Most entrees $12-30 range (haven't tried the Hibachi).    Overall: Reasonable value.  Average to good for Madison area, but somewhat middle of the road when compared to larger cities' options."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We ordered the shrimp tempura for an appetizer and received it right away. Then for dinner we ordered 4 different kind of rolls. Crunchy shrimp, rainbow roll, dragon roll and another one I can't remember the name of off the specialty menu. It took about 1.25 hours to receive our rolls. I'm sorry, I know it was busy, but it was completely packed....... and I've never had sushi anywhere else that it took so long to get! Also, the waitress rarely checked in on us the entire night. Although the sushi is good, you can't get sushi elsewhere for better service in town."}
{"text":"Pros - I've been here a couple times for the lunch specials and I would highly recommend getting the bento over the sushi rolls, as they are much more filling and offer a variety of food.  Cons - For a work day this place can be pretty packed for lunch, so if you arrive between 12-1 expect to wait 5 minutes or so to be seated, depending on how many you're with. Service wasn't great. I've also had way better sushi and bento in terms of quality  Overall -   Food - Basically I come here whenever I want to fix some craving for sushi, which happens like once or twice a month. If you're looking for better quality sushi, bento, or hibachi, you can go to their main branch on State St. I had dinners there and the quality of food was so much better than lunch at this location.  Price - Lunch price is OK, about $10 for a bento box or 2 sushi rolls, tips included  Service - Not good, but I guess during lunch everyone is in a hurry so I don't mind."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but I don't know a lot about it. However, I do know that the sushi I had at Takara on Whitney Way was terrible.   I went out for dinner with my husband and we ordered a spicy tuna roll and two special rolls, the Badger roll and the Puppy Love roll. We also ordered some chicken teriyaki.  The spicy tuna roll was alright, nothing special but nothing to complain about, either. However, both of the special rolls used imitation crab instead of real crab. GROSS. Unfortunately, the menu states \"crab\" and not imitation crab. I hate imitation crab. It's absolutely disgusting and I was really, really not happy to find it in sushi rolls that I paid $15 and $12 for, respectively. What a cheap, disgusting ingredient. I expect to find imitation crab in grocery store sushi, not in a sushi restaurant.   The chicken teriyaki was also disappointing. A chicken breast on a bed of onions with 2 each of baby corn, broccoli, and baby carrots. Yes, two. Flavor was okay, but nothing to write home about.  We will not be back. We ended up spending about the same as we would have to go downtown to Red Sushi or Restaurant Muramoto, and the food was awful. Never, never again."}
{"text":"I dined alone and was seated at a small table near the sushi bar.   I had one cocktail and it was nice and strong.  I ordered a sushi regular plate that had a sampling of several great sushi pieces and rolls.  I was travelling so I was not able to take a doggie bag and was not able to finish the plate.  I felt guilty until the waiter who took my plate away came out of the kitchen chewing .  I was feeling guilty about wasting, so that made me smile.  Great service and very good food."}
{"text":"The BMW roll was recommended by our server, Marla, and was fantastic. Our first time here and she helped us through the menu -- she knows the menu and can read people. Can't wait to come back. Nice gem tucked away on the west side."}
{"text":"This review is for lunchtime service.  Just not good enough given what we paid. At around $17 per person--that's including two kids by the way--I would expect much better food and quality of fish. The snapper was very chewy. And the biggest disappointment was the ISO Fantastic roll. This is one of the more expensive rolls you can get at Takara. It has tuna, salmon and yellowtail.. plus avocado. Should be awesome! In this case, it was nearly flavorless, and the fish chewy again. I was stacking up ginger and wasabi to try to get anything out of it.  The only redeeming fish was the yellowtail, which had a good texture and flavor.   Our server was great, prompt and friendly with substitutions for the kids. Takara also has a really great ambiance. Sadly, the price/performance of the food warrants only two stars."}
{"text":"Very fresh, beautiful presentation, very friendly staff, reasonably priced. I am visiting in town and was searching for a good place for sushi. Located in a shopping plaza but very clean and comfortable atmosphere. I enjoyed the deluxe sushi combo that included miso soup, 9 pieces of generous sushi and a tuna roll. Presentation was very nice too. Everything tasted fresh and of good quality including the green tea and miso soup.  I was a little disappointed with the calamari. It tasted good but looked like very consistently shaped onion rings so i wonder if is really was calamari. Plus the vinegar dressing that was served with it was odd. Solid 4 star! I will recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Get past the awful stripmall - and the 'dollar store' next door - and you'll find a clean, borderline-beautiful atmosphere and very good fish.    Their salmon is the best in town and the prices are the best in Madison for the quality of the fish.  The service is efficient and professional.  Its not a location where I go to impress people but its the place I go when I want good fish at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best sushi lunch in town, but you will wait for it regardless of how busy they are. Service is decent, English not the best."}
{"text":"Great fish, nothing smelled off and the interior was nice on the eyes. Better than what I can say for the crazy-assed outdoor mall it's in. (A Tad beat down.) Go for the fish.   The sushi bar's seats are a little uncomfortable. Sit at a table."}
{"text":"Takara is one of those places that I come to out of convenience.  It's close to work whenever I get the desire for sushi.  Their two/three roll specials are reasonably priced and come with either soup or salad (be warned, the salad is swimming in dressing).  The rice can be sometimes overcooked and the rolls are not expertly prepared but for those prices, let's be honest, can you ask for any more?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Tried the hibachi steak and salmon teriyaki bento box. Lunch prices here (usually like many sushi places - but those are limited in the area) are great! FYI they were unfamiliar with the free drink with Yelp check in but it was eventually sorted out. Service was alright and our food was decent. Miso soup was standard with some large chewy pieces of seaweed. The bento box had a delicious generous helping of salmon, almost a full California roll, some shrimp shumai type of item, rice and sliced canned pineapple - definitely recommend for value! The hibachi was fine but I felt that the sauce wasn't as great as some other places and some of the veggies were a little undercooked. The biggest downside was that the medium rare steak was actually well done. However at the end of the day, with these prices and the food being overall tasty,  we really couldn't complain. This will probably end up being a staple lunch place for us."}
{"text":"This is a must for a good sushi lunch on the West side of Madison. (Don't let the strip mall deter you.) Great deal on rolls very affordable with a wide variety. See menu below. You can do lunch for under $12. The sushi is tasty and well executed. The only variable that is hit or miss is the service. I have had a combination of prompt service but also slow service. The typical however is good and pleasant service."}
{"text":"I went here twice in the past week and I think it's awesome. The first time I went I had the Bento box with the pork Katsu and it was very good. The second time I went I have the lunch special of the sushi and sushimi and it was fantastic. I can't wait to go back and have some more sushi it was just so good."}
{"text":"This place is just an average japanese lunch place. Nothing bad to say about it but it wasn't outstanding either. The food was good and the portion sizes were reasonable. Nothing to complain about! The only problem I had was that they overcooked my medium rare steak!"}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short and simple:  The Phoenix roll was good.  My Hibachi Filet/Shrimp was mediocre.  The flavor was bland, and they provided no sauce to spruce it up.    I ordered Hibachi fried rice thinking that it would be similar to some of the rice I've had at the Hibachi restaurants where they cook in front of you.  Wrong.  Instead, I got Chinese food delivery rice.  Nothing about it was Japanese, and nothing about it was delicious.  Get this crap off of the menu.  My major complaint would have to be our waiter.  Uninterested does not begin to describe this man.  He took forever with our drinks.  He never filled our waters.  My \"hibachi fried rice' was so bad that I wanted to ask for some white rice (Which was supposed to come with my meal).  Unfortunately, the waiter did not come by until about 35 minutes after we received our meals, and that was only to ask if we wanted the check.    All of this for 30 bucks?  No thanks."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi here, with a chattier group of fish-slicers than I usually run into.  I liked their range of lunch specials, although I wasn't too much of a fan of the chicken donburi (rice bowl) I'd ordered.  It was lacking in flavor until I dropped a bunch of wasabi paste and soy into it.  The sushi itself was good, although nothing I was supremely crazy about.  Spicy tuna roll was standard, as were the hamachi, tobiko and unagi.  Wasn't a fan of the uni, though.  It didn't taste bad so much as it didn't taste like I'd expected.  No big deal, though.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lunch review only (based on 4 visits.)  Tucked away on the 4th floor of Les Cours Mont Royal, Takara is a great place for a weekday Japanese lunch.  Very reasonably priced lunch for the quality.  The presentation of the sushi was beautiful & thoughtful, incorporating fresh flowers.  Accessible via the the underground (very convenient in the dead of winter!)"}
{"text":"Takara has a very special place in my heart. It was where my boyfriend and I first met. It was also the place where we dined for our 1 year anniversary ( which is also the day I got a speeding ticket on our way to dinner. I am still upset about that)  I guess the best place to start is with the atmosphere. The restaurant is very small. They do have additional tables in the back for large parties that include flattop grills but even then, the space isn't very spacious. Once you walk in, there is a table that is right at the door. It's hard to feel like you have any privacy but they really can't take away tables or there would be quite the waiting time for diners. They really can't add addition room because they are a small sub division of or a larger strip mall. Really puts them in a tough place but it is also something that is needed.   That all being said, I really do enjoy the décor. The seats are comfortable and the tables are good sizes. Beautiful bar area for the sushi chefs. Extremely clean and great smells. There is a general bar area for additional seating but in my three times dining here, I've never seen people make use of it unless they are waiting on their to go order.   Not being much of a sushi person, I can't speak too much about their sushi, but I can say that Takara does offer a large range of entrees from teriyaki's to noodle dishes. I am a big fan of their Shrimp and Chicken Teriyaki. It comes with grilled carrots, zucchini, broccoli and onions toasted in a teriyaki sauce and a side of white rice. Shrimp are always cooked perfectly. I am also a fan of their tempura. Extremely crispy, buttery and flaky.   Services has always been on point every time I've dinned here, food has always been served piping hot and prices are decent. You pay for what you get. I can't complain about the quality. The food is served gorgeously to diners. They really do a fantastic job focusing on plate presentation.    The biggest let down really is the space as mention above. I just do not like restaurants to be so small that it makes you feel like you're sitting on top of each other. In some ways, it's uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I dined here with four friends of mine recently.    The atmosphere was very nice and classy with lots of Japanese decor and style.  Our waiter was good and prompt.   I ordered a full Shrimp Tempura meal.  The rice was nasic white rice, but still good  the shrimp tempura was excellent and came with fried veggies that were OK, but I'm not a huge vegitable fan so I might not be the best judge   The salad and miso soup were norhing special but perfectly fine.   My boyfriend and another friend got their Hot Tea.  It was really good and had a really lovely flavor.  I reccomend it.  Also some of us got the Hibachi which was done perfectly except that my friends' filet minion was welll done rather than medium rare; however, she forgot to specify how she wanted it cooked.   Really it was a great experience.  If I return it would be fun to rent one of the Japanese style rooms they have for reservation.  I over all reccomend going here."}
{"text":"A staple for good sushi on the west side of Madison. It's a nice balance of price and quality.  I also appreciate that they were one of the earlier restaurants to understand that a need for gluten-free food extends beyond just the soy sauce on the table. (It's generally in eel sauce, inari wrappers, and many tempura batters as well!)  Service over the years has been varied, from decent to \"enh.\" When they're busy, I often get the feeling that they want to turn over tables, and are quick to drop off the bill, but when it's quieter, this isn't as bad.  A solid place for a meal, especially for the gluten-free crowd."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu. I usually eat sushi and like what they offer. My wife is a big udon lover but never liked it here. I rarely come,here for dinner as they can be quite pricy."}
{"text":"terrible customer service. I made an delivery order and wait for 90mins and the food never come until I made a phone call to find out that some staff forget to put my order. And she didn't even feel sorry and ask me \"what do you want me to do?\"like I am the one who made mistake. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the spicy crab roll, and it was a great combination of crispy texture with savory and spicy flavors. My brother in law had the similar shrimp roll and enjoyed that as well. My wife ordered pot stickers and the calamari... Both were very good. The warm saki was also very smooth. We had just enough food between the three of us, adding an order of edamame.   We stayed to talk past the bill paying, and no one came back to check on us... Had to ask for more water. Not A+ service, but for the cost it was delicious. I will look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"After moving from Chicago, it was a must to find good sushi restaurant in Madison.  I was a little skeptical at first with it being in a strip mall next to a dollar store.  This place indeed went beyond my initial expectations.  I have been going to Takara for the last year and half and although I feel it has lacked a little since discovering it, I would still recommend this establishment.  They have a awesome lunch special as well, 2 rolls and miso soup for low cost."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of the food. Takara has quality sushi for the price. I was a little bummed out when I checked in on Yelp and was offered a free wine or beer as a Yelp deal. I asked my server right away and she went to ask a manager about it. She came back and said that they no longer offer that Yelp deal. Really? We had the lunch special of 3 rolls for roughly $13. It comes with choice of salad or soup. I had the salad and the dressing is pretty darn good. My dining companion went with the soup and was pleased with it. I had two tempura rolls and the whitefish roll. That is a full meal plus some to take home. The rolls were so good. The crunch of tempura was to die for. I would recommend their lunch specials. A very good deal. They also have a Sunday/Monday special of buy one specialty roll, get one for $1. They have a list of specialty rolls to choose from and then another list of $1 rolls (non-specialty) to choose from."}
{"text":"Great food. Loving the specials and the change of menu. Service is usually slow but seems to be improving. Forgot my salad today but that's okay I'm full!"}
{"text":"I came here for a celebratory lunch with a coworker.  We wanted yummy Japanese food and were NOT disappointed.  I had the Chicken Udon, it was a very nice serving, chicken was tender, and the noodles were quite good.  My colleague had the sushi lunch platter and was very happy with it - and she is a well versed sushi enthusiast.  The green tea icecream also received excellent reviews.  The decor is quite nice, there were a number of people there but, we didn't have to wait for a table.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  Am definitely going back.  If they keep it up, they'll get five stars :)"}
{"text":"Never been to such a flavorless Japanese restaurant. Never in my life have I had a plain broiled tough piece of scraggly beef that completely lacked any punch of flavor and was served plain without even a trace of teriyaki sauce but labeled as \"beef negimaki\". The plain iceberg lettuce covered in a tart dressing was ok but generic. The California roll had no flavor on its own. It had to be soaked in shoyu to provide ume. I'll also mention the server was not overly enthusiastic or helpful about wrapping up our meal. They did not even put the entire meal in a bag to be carried out. They also did not bring or offer a high chair right away or a children's menu so I would not qualify this as a family friendly or child friendly place."}
{"text":"Food is fine. No lunch specials. Hostess isn't quite \"present\". That's pretty much it."}
{"text":"I've been to Takara a handful of times now and as someone who lives in easy driving distance of it I am sad to say I didn't go there for years because of the lackluster quality of its State Street branch. Don't make the same mistake I did, the sushi here is very good!  I've had their steak hibachi and unlike many I've had elsewhere they did not cook the steak into a dried out mess but left it still somewhat tender. The rice was good and overall the meat / rice / vegetable ratio is pretty close to optimal.   As far as their sushi I've had a variety of rolls and found them all to be very good. As I tend to favor simpler rolls rather than their more elaborate fair that's about all I can say for them but others I've gone with have gotten the fancy ones and at the very least they are beautifully crafted (since I did not steal their food -- that's what I've got).  Their ambiance feels very Japanese which is something lacking even in some of the better sushi restaurants in Madison.   On State Street, hit up Wasabi, but if you are on the near west side and need a sushi fix -- you ought to go to Takara."}
{"text":"I have actually enjoyed the sushi at this restaurant but in my last order I went to pick up my order and the order wasn't correct. I called to let them know and said that this order wasn't correct. The person on the phone said she packed it herself and there was nothing wrong with the order. At first I thought all but one roll was wrong and Then after looking at it there where 2 that where wrong. I had ordered a philly roll and none existed no cream cheese and no salmon I believe it was a crab roll with avocado. She wanted me to bring it back. The drive was 30 min for me and that was a crazy idea. She said I was wrong. I told her that I know what smoke salmon looked like and it wasn't white. She didn't cut me any slack. I ended up telling her that I would never becoming back and I had thought this was one of the better places for sushi but I didn't' appreciate being told I wasn't telling the truth. When I worked with customers they where always right and I made it right for the customer. I have been placing orders regularly and it wasn't like I have made a complaint like this before. I hung up on her. I will never ever eat here again. They could of just gave me 2 free rolls the next time I came in. Now they have lost a continuing customer."}
{"text":"I have many good experiences here so my visit last night was a surprise.  My friend arrived first and felt like the Hostess did not acknowledge her for several minutes.  To the point of my friend having to physically stand in front of the woman.  When I joined, we ordered the Edamame and the Takara Seafood Salad, as starters.  The Edamame was as good as ever.  Steamed well with a nice amount of salt to flavor.  I could eat an order by myself if I didn't want to get sushi and rolls.  Now for the Takara Seafood Salad, which neither of us had ordered before.  I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect a iceberg lettuce salad with a few pieces of sushi grade fish on top.  It was disappointing.    Our server at this point is a shy but sweet young woman.  She delivered some small plates and bowls to the table and when she brought the edamame, she did not bring a separate plate for the shells.  So, we used the plates that were in front of us.  The Hostess walked by to collect used plates from tables and she scolded us for using the little plates ( \"Those are for the rolls \" she TOLD us.  Can you feel the eye roll in that statement?)  We ordered a few pieces of Sushi (Tako, Unagi, and Maguro).  And three Maki Rolls: Hotate, Naruto, and the Fashion.  All of these were very good.  After we got new little plates...that is.  We both got the Green Tea.  We both felt the tea was really Earthy in taste.  Last issue was when it came to the bill.  We asked to split the bill in half but it all went on my card.  I did get an apology from our server and a half-assed explanation that I didn't quite understand from the Hostess.  At that point, I was ready to just get out of there so I didn't ask for clarification.  I will give them another try in the future but maybe not for a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.    Yes, we're in the Midwest (thank you for sharing), the ocean isn't just a hop, skip and jump away to catch the nearest fish. But Takara does a wonderful job with their sushi. It is always fresh (as seen by display of fish at the sushi bar) and always tasty. I'm not a sushi expert by any means, but if it tastes good, I'm going to eat it. And Takara's sushi tastes good.  Better than most places I've tried. I prefer the spicy tuna roll as one of my favorites.   Lunch is CHEAP. $12 bucks for three rolls? Yes please! It fills you up too. Service is wonderful here, they are always so friendly."}
{"text":"Always incredible and friendly service. They remember who we are and love to talk to us, which we enjoy. The food is ALWAYS outstanding and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Not the most original sushi in town, but still very good. The bento boxes at lunch are great... A lot of choice of boxes and a lot of variety per box. I have been a few times and it's always super fresh.  Service is great.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"A little gem tucked away in Les Cours Mont-Royal. I've been there half a dozen times for lunch and dinner. Happy to say the quality of the sushi and sashimi has been consistently great, very fresh and nicely presented. Also, the lunch specials are a real deal with generous portions of the good stuff. I've had the Sushi Sashimi Deluxe and Sushi Ten Combo -- both recommended. I would definitely go back and probably will very soon!"}
{"text":"OK it's the day after Christmas you've had your holiday dinner, step away from the traditional American food and move into the Japanese genre, Sushi.  While visiting Oregon Wisconsin we took a drive over to the Whitney location of the Takata restaurant.    Situated in a strip mall, there's plenty of convenient free parking. When you open the door, you will immediately appreciate the dark wood ambiance with a large golden lit-up fish and a traditional bar that appeared to be well-stocked with top shelf spirits.  I didn't have a cocktail but I did take advantage of the yelp offer... Checking-in on yelp you get a free glass of wine or beer.  Good deal!   For lunch I tried four different types of rolls, California roll, salmon roll, tuna roll and a shrimp and avocado roll. All were fresh, meaty and well prepared. They were plated nicely I found the presentation to be attractive - you can see my pictures. The roles were accompanied with a fresh iceberg salad, the ginger purée salad dressing was delicious.  We were well taken care of, our server was attentive and double checked the items on the order and followed up several times to make sure we were getting everything we needed.   Next time I visit Madison area I'll eat at Takata again.   Salute!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. They can be quick if its not peak lunch hours. Expect to wait a little longer around noon but its not bad. They have a sushi roll lunch special that's a decent price and the sushi is good.  I think dinner can be kinda pricey. If I want to spend a lot on sushi for dinner I like to go somewhere a little nicer with more variety, better drinks and appetizer options too. But overall food and service are good and will keep coming for lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely go here for the Sushi!  Other meals are mostly above average.  Sorry I didn't get a photo of my sushi, but it needed to be devoured immediately.  On this visit I also enjoyed a Seafood and Veggie Tempura dish. Shrimp, scallops, fish, crab sticks and a nice variety of veggies. I took nearly half of it home. Hint: split this dish among two diners.  My husband's Steak Hibatchi arrived VERY cold....but the server had the kitchen warm it up in good speed. His fried rice was super delicious!  My advice is to order sushi, Sushi and SUSHI."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. It took over an hour and a half to receive my online order. When I called the restaurant at the 90 minute mark, the woman on the phone told me that delivery just takes a long time. When I said I wanted a refund, because she said it would still be another 30 minutes, she hung up on me. The sushi is mediocre and for the price, go to one of the good sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I use to order carryout from this place once a week at least but they started messing up my order and were not interested in correcting their mistakes.  When I questioned their customer service they were fine with me taking my business elsewhere.  Totally rude."}
{"text":"Great fish, great prices, awesome service! They have a great outdoor patio. So many choices now in Gilbert, you will not be disappointed with Takara. Some of our favorites: spicy tuna salad, spicy salmon skin hand roll & Jennifer roll. Large beers to go with sushi only $2.99. Very few places (trust me, we go to all of them) offer the quality they have here. The way the owner puts these rolls together is incredible. The attention to detail of every single plate that comes out is amazing."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my daughter to a hibachi grill style restruant, looked online and found Takara. Do not be fooled! They have a Habachi menu but it isn't even cooked on a grill. We made the huge mistake of not leaving as soon as we arrived. We walked in and no habachi grill. We asked the hostess about this and she said they make it in the back. Ok, fine, we were very hungry! We were seated and given menus. The waitress brought our room tempature waters, no ice and straight from the tap if I had to guess. She spilled half of mine of the table and said sorry. Ok, fine, it happens, nothing I'm going to get upset about. She walks away and doesn't return to clean the pool of water off our table! We only had one napkin each and it took all 3 of our cloth napkins to clean our table. She came back and took our orders. We made the biggest mistake of the day by ordering off the \"hibachi\" menu. Husband got filet mignon, the kiddo and I got chicken. It comes with soup and salad. The salad was not fresh. The bottom of the bowl was pooled with a lot of water, the tomato was so mushy from sitting in water all day. Then she brings out the soup and she spills that too! She didn't bother to clean that or bring us new napkins from her spilling the water, so we took them off the tables near us. We should have just ordered the sushi, but we had our heart set on grilled meat and fried rice and veggies. She brings out our hibachi food...I've never seen anything served at any restruant that looked anything like that in my entire life. The rice wasn't fried, it was normal white rice in a seprate bowl. The veggies were soft and mushy, like they were spooned out of a soup kettle that was simmering all day. And there was a watered down sauce smothering everything. It was more like a soup served on a plate. Everything was cold and mushy, except the meat. The chicken and steak were swimming in this weird, cold, gravy-soup sauce. The whole meal tasted and looked like it was sitting in a crock pot all day long, and someone turned the crock pot off a few hours before serving. After the meal the waitress came by and asked how everything was, my husband said it wasn't quite what he was expecting when we ordered a hibachi dinner. The waitress then told us that this is how they serve it at this location and that if we wanted meat cooked off the grill with dipping sauces (you know...like every other hibachi restaurant serves) then we would have to go their downtown location. I'm still shocked that this was served to us. It was so bad. I will never eat at this place again. It was so gross. I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was one of the worst places I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place. Great menu for both my sushi-obsessed and sushi-averse friends, with a fun selection of rolls."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving... This place has great sushi that's on par with expensive Chicago restaurants!"}
{"text":"I lovr takara. It's \"affordable\" sushi (cheap sushi is never good and this sushi doesn't cost me my first born son) plus the vegetarian rolls are freaking delicious... I don't know maybe it's just me but any sushi joint is 5 star"}
