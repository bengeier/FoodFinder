{"text":"This place has got to be the WORST service ever!!!!!!!  Not only was there only one waitress but she was only serving 3 tables MAX! My co_worker and I were starving after work. Got to this place around 7:45pm. We were waiting for some friends so we had pre-order some food thinking that by the time they got there we would be eating.   Nope not the case. It took about 25 mins for our first order and we didnt order that much. We told the waitress that we can see our food sitting at the sushi bar and she walked over to the sushi bar and didnt bother bringing it to us. We might as well just got up off our seats and got it ourselves. The waitress was reading a menu!!!!! Our table of 4 were so irritated because everytime we ordered it would take about 25 mins to get the next round of food. and we didnt get everything we ordered. The waitress could care less that we were there.   After all is said and done. We complained, didnt get no sorry, no nothing! They just talked in their language and gave us dirty looks and didnt even say goodnight to us. BTW we left there at 9:45. It took THAT LONG!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anybody even if its the last sushi place on earth"}
{"text":"I'm so glad our friends recommended this place! A bit out of my way, but worth every trip. Fresh ingredients and super friendly service. Great flavours, over and over. We've always had the all-you-can-eat tepenyaki and what a great show for the whole family! The tappanyaki chef is a great performer and gets the kids involved. They love how he puts out the fire. You'll have to enjoy to see."}
{"text":"What do you do when you want sushi but also want chicken/rice,tapenyaki and happen to have people with you that can only eat Halal! - TADAAAA - welcome to Kobe!  Located right off of Derry rd, in a long strip plaza with a huge banner (see picture)   open mon - thu 11am - 10:30pm  fri - 11am - 11:30pm sat - 4pm - 11:30pm sun -4pm - 10:30pm  Delivery & takeout (cash only) sit down - amex, visa, mc, debit  Good for groups, the price range is decent.  The place looks a tad tacky on the inside as much as it does on the outside. With 1997 xmas lights and odd nick knacks displayed about. This isn't a formal place but very group friendly.   The service is mediocre. As long as you know what you want, order it all at first order taking. The staff is pretty polite but I really dislike when they start talking in their native language right in front of you...and you KNOW it's about you. Sigh.. why do people do this? The only thing it does is make the other person feel uncomfortable. Nothing else.   The range of food is insanely cool. They have  Sushi Tappenyaki Hakka Asian style Thai Halal meat  Walked into this little place about 9:40pm and even though they were closing at 10:30pm, they still seated us. Which I really appreciated.   The waitress was really helpful, considering it was the end of her shift.   order: rock & roll maki - WOW. I have never seen this type of roll anywhere else, It was an explosion of flavours. I couldn't moan out of pure gratification , any more then I did. THANK goodness the place was practically empty. *Last table was paying and about to leave. This maki roll had , shrimp tempura, cream cheese , cucumber and slices of crab meat right on top of the roll.  The cream cheese mixed with the shrimp and rice roll was heaven! the crab meat was delicious, tender and in perfect temperature.  California rolls - I always have this at any new sushi place. I truly believe it sets the standard for how the rest of the maki rolls will be like. This was a success. Fresh cucumber, avocado was perfect texture. Not too creamy, not too hard.  Spicy salmon maki - Really good. I'm not a huge salmon fan , but this was done really well. Normally you get the salmon portion overpowering the sauce. This was perfect, the salmon was a smaller portion and for once, the sauce wasn't more than the rice. Delicious.   Tempura appetizer - Too small of  a portion for an appetizer. Isn't it universally accepted that apps are shared. Whats the deal? there was only 2 shrimps and 2 veggies - lame.    Edemame - I cannot live without having this. Too much salt but boiled at the right degree. Fresh! Good job Kobe, for not giving me the last batch of the evening!    Lemon chkn with white rice - my poor friend had such high hopes for this dish. The chicken had soo much batter, the sauce was watered down. Think - slices of lemon and hot water. The rice was decent.   General Tao with white rice - Yumm! I was happy with the chicken. The sauce was in good balance with the amount of chicken. Also, for once it actually tasted like it was cooked well. Not just heated up.   desert: green tea ice cream - good batch! had no extra ice - this usually means they are busy and always have fresh tubs available. ^_^ red bean ice cream - tried this for the first time and WOW....so yummy. I really suggest everyone to try this at least once. ESPECIALLY if you like vanilla. The cream is just right.. the beans are so tiny so you get only a few, but its in perfect proportion to the 2 scoops they give you. It's light and not overtly sugary which helps to not make you feel sticky and full after all the above. he eh ^_^  The staff did a splendid job of coming twice to ask if everything was okay. They really were group serving ready. How?  these are the signs:  -Taking the order and reading it again to each person AND asking if anyone wants extra sauces  - bringing a jug of water without being asked - bonus bonus bonus brownie points - bring in extra plates and napkins - coming to check once after the first round of meals is served and letting the group know that they will be coming when they meals are finished - and did exactly JUST that - coming once with all the food. Not giving one person food and making the rest wait. - BONUS points - not printing out bills , until later. Allowing to pay split with 3 different methods. - How catering!  The total was $61.09 - which split 3 ways is a ridiculously cheap $21.  well.. 20.35 to be exact... with tip it came up to 27.00 each. Fantastic!  I am really really impressed with this place. It has no fancy decor or signs outside, but definitely makes up for it in terms of the service and food.   I took my eyeliner out and write \"a fantastical delicious little hole on earth\" on a paper outside the entrance door :)   - there wasn't much left of the liner anyway. Myeh. The people have the right to know.   xoxo M."}
