{"text":"I order take out here all the time.  We're talking one of my favourite restaurants on earth.  I recommend the e14, usually a small.  I can never finish a large.  It is inexpensive, but delicious.  I'm pretty sure magic is somehow involved.

My friends like the I1.

Either get a seat in there or better yet, try a picnic.

The end."}
{"text":"I woke up with a sore throats and immediately needed spicy veggie broth soup. Pho U is close to us so we came right when they opened and the server was lovely and welcoming, and made sure to clarify whether I wanted vegetarian or beef broth. Loaded with noodles and veggies it was simple and satisfying. My partner got the rare beef noodle soup and also enjoyed it. We both had good soup sweats and came out feeling refreshed. Will come back often!"}
{"text":"All good. I liked their take on fresh wrapped spring rolls. Pho is better than average and service was quick and competent"}
{"text":"If a had a choice between Hanoi 3 seasons on Gerard or this place, I still would pick Hanoi but only because the flavor of their broth is out of this world. 

That being said, this place is a REALLY close second. I usually take it to go. The owners are very kind and greet you warmly when you come in. They take extra care in packing up food with all the fixings (sauces, basil, bean sprouts, chili peppers) that you would need/want. The pho is such a good balance of flavor, texture (with the meats) and perfectly prepared noodles. I really can't say enough about this place. Give it a try for sure if you're looking for a little neighborhood place to support. They really put their heart into the food. 

Their prices are reasonable with the small pho being the perfect portion for lunch and their larger one being excellent for a heavier meal or I've saved some for the second day."}
{"text":"Really great take out Vietnamese food.  I had the vermicelli with grilled beef and it was pretty authentic, beef was tender and seasoned well, good portions.  My partner had the same with lemongrass chicken which was also really good.  I saw a few people eating pho there which smelled yummy so will definitely be back to try that.  The place is pretty small with limited seating and apparently no AC so probably better for take-out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sit-down meal, this space may be a little too cramped. However, Pho U is fantastic for take out, as they normally have their orders ready within 10-15 minutes from placing a call.

I've tried the following, all of which have been good, but nothing extraordinary: the house special beef pho, shrimp rice paper rolls (which was a very, very small portion, especially for $4), the deep fried shrimp rolls, the mixed vegetable soup, and the grilled chicken salad (this dish, I liked the least). 

BUT....

I tried their lemongrass chicken pho, and it is to die for. TO DIE FOR. I've never had chicken pho before, but I'm sure glad I tried it here first 'cause it's delicious. They give a generous portion of perfectly seasoned chicken as well."}
{"text":"This place strikes me as suspiciously similar to the place that shut down further up Parliament just north of Prospect (Pho Indochina). I'm saying this because the pho here sucks in the same ways the pho sucked at the other place (probably contributing to the reason it shut down) -- as the other reviewer mentioned, super mushy, overcooked noodles, and really tasteless/watery broth. I also think it might be the same owners because the bowls used look similar to the bowls used at the other place, but I could be wrong. 

When we went there (for the first and last time), the waiter ignored us for the first 10 minutes. When some other guests came in after us, he chatted with them,  took their orders, AND served them before even acknowledging us. Normally I don't care that much about service if the food is good (why I keep going to Sukhothai despite their awful customer service), but if you're gonna serve bad food, you could at least try to make it up in service. Not so here.  

Anyway, really disappointing that no one seems to be able to cook a good bowl of pho on Parliament. Much better to walk, bike, or streetcar over to Mi Mi's on Gerrard, a block east of Broadview, or Que Ling off of Gerrard, first street on the south side (can't go wrong with a $4.40 bowl of pho). 

If you're really craving something pho-like, Sukhothai south of Dundas on Parliament has this Thai variation of it with hearty blocks of beef brisket that might do."}
{"text":"Quality at the right price in the right location! Sure it's not the top pho in town, but it's fresh and straightforward. Also, the rest of their menu is really yummy. I love having a spot in South Cabbagetown where I can pick of a decent lunch that's affordable. In my many experiences since they opened last year I've always had considerate and quick service, everyone is attentive and kind."}
{"text":"ordered the vegetable pho from uber eats and was VERY happy with it! will order again :)"}
{"text":"Cozy clean little noodle place on Parliament at Gerard St. Looking at the menu they do serve curry, chow mein & pad thai so not entirely an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. I love curry so I ordered the curry chicken steak (white meat option is also available) noodle soup. The broth wasn't spicy hot like in a curry but mellowed out by the stock and still surprisingly tasty. Rice noodles are your standard and the chicken tasted like any grilled lemongrass chicken. Overall a satisfying bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. It's a very small restaurant so you would be eating very closely with other costumers. No AC in the summer. Rare beef pho lacks flavour and meat but the curry chicken noodle soup was not bad."}
{"text":"Pho U adds a much needed Vietnamese option to the Cabbagetown food scene. With the demise of Ginger (not that I would count that as real Vietnamese food), there was no where to get a pho fix during my lunch hour. Enter Pho U.

It's not the world's greatest Pho, but it does the trick. Service is friendly and quick, prices are reasonable as well. They also have Chinese food options on their menu, your typical greasy Chinese take out.

If you aren't too picky about authenticity then you'll be happy dining here. My Pho loving father is never quite satisfied with his meal here, but I always want more noodles!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats. I ordered the house special. 10/10. Everything was nicely packaged, their soup base didn't take too strong. I loved it!! If you're craving a nice bowl of pho I would definitely recommend. $7.99"}
{"text":"Food here is not good. The pho broth is lacking flavour and there is much better pho to be found just a bit east."}
{"text":"I found this great little Vietnamese restaurant in Cabbage Town during my daily travels as an Uber driver. It is a small family owned business and they are super friendly. Very impressed by the cleanliness throughout. Most entr√©es are not over $7.99 including tea - so it is a great bargain. All the dishes are made to order with love and are very tasty - especially the Curry Beef Stew  soup w/rice noodle. The broth is incredibly rich and flavourful. 

It is now my 'go to' lunch place when I am driving - sometimes coming back 2 or 3 times a week. Enjoy!

Update: Prices have gone a buck or two, but it still a great value and is my favourite place in town. I believe the word is getting out, as it seems to be much fuller these days."}
{"text":"I go to Pho U semi frequently, and it never fails to disappoint! The service is fast, the food is good and the people are nice :)"}
{"text":"A++ restaurant. Fabulous Curry Dishes and Chicken Sticks. Recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Curry Chicken Rice Noodle Soup was quite tasty, rich w/ a good amount of spice.

Pho was mediocre at best though.  Also, no leafy greens were given to add to it, and the bean sprouts were well beyond fresh."}
{"text":"visited this place for dinner based on good reviews, the good thing is the service was good and she kept the place very clean.

However, I was very disappointed by the food. Mango salad roll came with hoisin sauce with peanut sauce on top. peanut sauce tasted literally like peanut butter, and the rolls tasted like it's been in the fridge, I don't just mean it's cold and a little dry, I taste the fridge smell in the rolls.

my main was K6 the vermicelli and sauteed beef and spring rolls. the vermicelli felt like it's just rice noodles, the beef was so salty and a fairly burnt but without the satisfying aroma of something you expect off a grill. I can't say the 2 things I ordered were decent food.

the space is dated, the air smells a little much on the greasy side, I wanted to get out quick so my coat doesn't smell like grease afterwards."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place opening up. Decided last week we'd check it out this past Friday night.  I love Pho, having recently moved here from Queen W.  perhaps we were spoiled by having Golden Turtle so close by.  We went here and were disappointed in the service and the food.  We ordered an appetizer - beef fresh rolls and two orders of Pho.  Our appetizers took a long time to arrive, then were offered to customers at another table before being redirected to us.  The Pho was passable at best.  The noodles were overcooked and would break as you ate them.  They were almost mushy.  The bean spouts that accompanied the Pho can in a small square bowl with no mint and what appeared to be a piece of dried out lime, perhaps left over from earlier in the day.  The broth was decent, the meat was okay, but the entire experience came in a lot lower of the satisfaction scale than we hoped it would.  Will likely give it another try, but if it's not good then, we'll be going a little further for Pho."}
{"text":"We found this tiny restaurant by chance but it turned out to be a real lucky discovery for lunch. The pho is delicious with a tasty broth and tons of veggies and tofu. The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. The place is spotlessly clean and the kitchen is right in view for all to see. The service at lunch was extremely warm and friendly not to mention efficient. There's paid parking on the street right out in front. We will definitely go back. Bon appetit."}
{"text":"love their rare beef pho and small portioan of bbq
but they dont have air conditioning...;("}
{"text":"First visit, and I was pleasantly surprised! Offered a glass of cucumber water when I first sat down. Since it was hot and dusty out, it was a very nice gesture. 
Had the Pho, which was great and since I was in a little bit of a rush, didn't have time to try more off the menu. I should have, and will definitely be back to try more. 
What really impressed me, was the constant smile from the woman serving me, and how pleasant she made my short, but sweet, visit. 
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst cutomer service. They dont know how to talk to the customers.  We order vegetable and beef Steam Noodles  , Vegetable noodles  they make it too sour , throw it in the garbage bin."}
{"text":"Pretty average pho restaurant.  Have had soups here a few times and all have been decent. Of course there are other pho restaurants I enjoy more. Service is friendly and they are quick with take out orders. Small seating area inside the restaurant.  Pretty good value. I would return but only because it's a convenient location."}
{"text":"I am super stoked that this place opened up in the neighborhood. It's my new go-to pho spot. The broth is hearty and their house special has all the little bits I love. Great spot to sit down and warm up for lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the most disappointing Vietnamese I've had in the city. The bun was just mushy noodles and uninspired spring rolls, cartiledgey meat and some sad lettuce. The fried rice had three peas in it. It was just not good. Cheap though."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! We have ordered delivery three times. I am addicted to pho and am vegetarian. They have lots of options. It's affordable, quick and so far the best place I can find for delivery. 
The bean sprouts, lime, jalape√±o come on the side to stay crispy. They include sauces. Big portions with tons of vegetables. My spouse ordered a beef one once and seemed to like it but now he gets the vegetarian for all the vegetables. 
Vegetarian chow main is super good too"}
{"text":"Another 3 star restaurant in the neighbourhood. 
OK decent food, OK pho but damn I wish there was another Pho to compete around...

When I want a pho, I'll continue to take the streetcar and go East to East Chinatown or Pho Cam Tam on Gerard. This place is really if I am too lazy..."}
{"text":"Not often have I come across food and coffee that I liked so much, I'd be willing to kill for them."}
{"text":"Meh

Perhaps Pho U is not for you to enjoy at home. Other reviews attest to great on site dining. I ordered via uberEats and I wasn't very impressed. 

On the upside the pho was expertly packaged- soup, meats and noodles, and other garnish were in 3 separate containers- and it all kept surprisingly well in the fridge. 

But the \"Vietnamese spring rolls\" (nems, to some of us) were a complete letdown. 
And the fried chicken made for the driest and most overpriced wings I've ever had.  

I RECOMMEND- sticking to pho and maybe trying the curry but staying away from their fried foods.

EXTRA TIP- online ordering doesn't let you specify what type of spring rolls you want, so whether you are vegetarian or carnivorous, beware."}
{"text":"Skimpy. Smallest pho portion of meat and basil; three slices of rare, one piece of tendon, two slices of welldone. Was not worth it. Also the beef wonton was very small for 6.50.  Do not order via UberEATS!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service - and the food was pretty good - especially for the portion size and the price. I got a large, which was $6, and I was too full to finish. Probably not the greatest pho in the whole city, but a solid option. I will certainly be back."}
