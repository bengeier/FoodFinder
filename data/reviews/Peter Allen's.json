{"text":"Won't be back! Service was so slow that when my salmon arrived raw I sent it back and did not have time for them to try again. No one ever came? to our table to apologize, not the manager, hostess or anyone. In addition, there were multiple 'extra charges' we? were not told about and that were not on the menu: for gorgonzola on our salads, and for greens and beans which was described on the menu 'with sausage or potato', there was an extra charge for the sausage! Hostess was rude when we arrived. One of the worst dining experience in Pittsburgh in over 25 years!!"}
{"text":"The bartender is great! The service was okay. The food is very disappointing. We will return for drinks....nothing more."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Bland food.  Rude service.  Hopefully something worthy of this location will take over soon. Save your money."}
{"text":"My experience was the same as most of the other reviewers. I had two negative experiences at the same location when the restaurant was called Bravo Franco. The renovation and name change was like lipstick on a pig. My office decided to go here for our Christmas luncheon (I voted for another restaurant), and it was OK for that. I order spaghetti and meatball with bolognese sauce, thinking it was a safe choice. The spaghetti was mushy; shouldn't a place like this be able to cook pasta al dente? I couldn't tell if the sauce was good, because they didn't drain the pasta; there was visible water filling half the bowl. Big portions, though. And their chicken pastina soup was tasty. To sum up: mediocre food and plenty of it."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Calamari was greasy and totally overcooked. Thought I'd get the fettuccine Alfredo because you can't mess that up, right? WRONG! The sauce was watery and tasted like bleach. Service was not great. Watched a waitress have a conversation with someone while pouring water out of a pitcher onto the floor. Would never go back again even if someone paid me. Wasted $60 on hot garbage"}
{"text":"Based on their seating arrangement, I'm giving it two stars. The bank of tables to the right of the restaurant is TOO CLOSE TOGETHER. If you have to move the table to get your customers into the booths along the wall, the tables are TOO CLOSE TOGETHER. Everyone who was seated along that wall was very verbal about how much they hated being like sardines. It's horrible and uncomfortable. Also, the waiter's butt was in my face - literally - every time he handed something to our neighbors. This is just not acceptable. The food, we thought, was actually decent. I had the pastina soup and fettuccini with marinara.  The sorbet was not sorbet, though. Very flaky, not creamy or smooth at all. The seating, however, will keep us from returning. There is no way in the world we want to sit that close to strangers, nor do I want a waiters backside in my face all night. No thanks."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been eating at Bravo Franco for years. We loved the food, customer service, and romantic atmosphere. We were so excited to try Peter Allen's when we were back in the Pgh area but a little disappointed. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. She had great recommendations and was attentive. However, the menu is basically the same as when it was Bravo Franco but with jacked up prices. The break was pretty stale. Our entrées were hot and tasted fine, but they were out of 2 options that my fiancé wanted to order. He ended up with a baked potato that was no way near worth $8. I had the chocolate mousse for dessert which tasted like regular pudding with Hershey's syrup dumped all over it..not what it used to be. Might try it again.."}
{"text":"Our group of nearly 25 had reservations this evening as a kind of family/friend/ in membrance reunion.  For most of us, it was the first time in this restaurant.  There were 5 physicians and several engineers, teachers, professors, and other professionals in this group; most of the group was from Africa. I say this to give you an idea of the nature of our group. Reservations had already been made so when we came in, we expected to be seated.  The tables were not yet arranged so we were patient during the confusion of seating us all.  The food was okay... In fact, I think that most of us would have been tempted to go again had the service at the end of our meal not been so impolite.  They wanted us to leave at 6:00 p.m. though at least 15 minutes of our time was wasted in seating.  Anyway, that's when the comments started about getting us out of our seats and out of the restaurant began; that's when the bumping (3 times that we know of) came about when the waitress bumped up against several members of our group..... The husband to one of the women who was bumped several times and I went to speak to the lady in charge that evening; she seemed somewhat apologetic, however she insisted that people were waiting for our seats.    She and her staff will certainly never have to worry about seeing any of us in her restaurant again; we got the message that our patronage was not appreciated.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Entree was very good as was service.  The \"hostess\" was not friendly and dressed in all black and white (way unattractive attitude). No vinegar /oil on table.  Cold bread not very good .  Salad was soaked in salty dressing. They charge $8 to split entree so we each got one. Ample but not overwhelming. Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"The Restaurant was beautifully renovated from the Old Bravo Franco. The prices were as you would expect on the high end for an upscale restaurant but not overly priced. I dined with a friend. We had a couple of drinks which were size wise pretty large. We ordered two appraisers.I had oysters Rockefeller which consisted of 6 beautiful and tasty, my friend had their famous zucchini which was great and lots of it.  For our entree I had Pappardelle Bolognese the portion was large the noodles were great and the meat sauce was sweet with plenty of meat.My friend has the Veal Romano he said it was great  there were two large pieces. We did not order dessert as we were full. We went to the bar and has sambucca the pour was good. As to the service it was excellent. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Worst Manager I have ever met. If negative stars would be an option, the screen would be completely full. I am 47 years and have Never seen someone with such a negative attitude.  Stay Away..."}
{"text":"Super slow service. I don't know if they were short a cook or a waitress or both.   The fried calamari was delicious and generous. I'm glad we ordered it with our drinks because it was another half hour before our waitress took our dinner order.   I ordered the sea bass.  \"We don't have it.\" I ordered the scallops.   An hour and a half after we sat down, our food arrived. It tasted fine. Maybe I'm ignorant but i feel like for $30 i should get more than 5 or 6 scallops and a tiny cup of soup. Maybe like a veggie or starch (or dare i suggest both?) to accompany without paying extra."}
{"text":"Boo!  Not sure how they stay in business ... never again.  We (party of four) were going to an 8:00 show at the Benedum Center - and made 6:15 reservations (which were accepted).  I showed up at 5:40 - 'checked in for my reservation' - I had a drink at the bar, and the rest of our party showed up at 6:00 (15 minutes before our reservation).  We were told we would need to eat at the bar no tables available.  I told her she had a reservation for us ... too bad for us.  We didn't like that option - but at that point, we didn't want to risk being late for the 8:00 show, so we didn't have much of a choice.  That being said, there were only three seats available at the bar - so the manager said that one couple was about to leave, and we could have their seat.  Unfortunately, that couple waited for their check for about 10 minutes - so they couldn't leave (so we all couldn't sit) ... putting us to about 6:15.  We finally got our four seats at the bar - and ordered drinks and got menus.  The one bartender in the packed bar didn't get our drinks until about 6:35.   Mindful of the time, we immediately ordered our dinners mentioning we were going to the 8:00 show.  Salads were delivered to us about 30 minutes later (7:05),  At that point, we were asked to 'move down a stool' as they were cramming another party of 5 at the bar... so we moved our salads, drinks down one and moved down.  We again reminded the bartender we were going to an 8:00 show ... and he said everyone in the restaurant was doing the same.  Nice.  Our dinners arrived at 7:30 ... two of the four were rather cold ... but what could we do?  No time to send them back. Nobody to complain to as they were dropped off and he moved on to the other side of the bar.  Again, since we were going to the show, we had to eat and run.  I asked the bartender to bring the check when he dropped off our dinners as we were in a time crunch (did I mention the 8:00 show?).  We ate our cold veal parm and cold ravioli (which may have been very good if served at least warm).  Now - I don't mean to whine ... and if we were planning on having sandwiches and beer at a bar, I'd understand and wouldn't complain.  But our check was about $200. I have no problem paying for a nice meal and experience; however, to be denied a table when we had a reservation ... and to be moved, bumped and nudged during our meal - only to get served a cold meal.  Nah - never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after we got married to celebrate since we didn't go on a honeymoon. They were short staffed but they did okay. We didn't have the wait to long and the lobster ravioli I got was amazing. I'd go here again."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Great atmosphere.  But the server was not friendly. Took our order and walked away.  Never offered sides or talked about the menu. Didn't make direct eye contact which is a huge thing in customer service."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in Pittsburgh. Poor service. Dishes and plates look like they were bought secondhand from Goodwill's.  And food tasted horrible. We were forced to go there because of the shows. Never again.  Even Fast-food place can do better."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try this restaurant due to the low rating on Yelp but thought the location was convenient since we were seeing a show. Arrived early for our reservation and walked to the hostess stand where an annoyed woman asked \" if we were normal\" because they need \"normal people\". The hostess and waitress proceed to gossip about a couple who were just seated. Against my better judgement, we stayed and had a drink at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Bartender was helpful in explaining their beer variety and once we finished our drink, we asked if the drinks would be transferred to our table or if we needed to settle at the bar. A waitress mentioned that the bartender would transfer to our table until the rude hostess than cut her off and awkwardly told the waitress that she was wrong. We settled our bill at the bar. We sat at our table and the restaurant was getting busier with patrons. A group of 8 came in and were split into two tables. We overheard the waitress say \" I don't know what the hell were you thinking coming in here without a reservation on a Saturday night?\" to this group. Very unprofessional and disrespectful. While we were eating, the hostess went and sat down at the table and said something to them again. Next thing we know, all eight  people stood up and told the waiter to cancel their dinners. The nicely dressed gentleman did not cause a scene but I heard him tell the waiter that \" they did something  very wrong\". The food was decent but with an experience like that, we will not return. The hostess should really consider another line of work, perhaps one that does not involve human interaction."}
{"text":"It looked nice & upscale. And the menu was truly interesting. Waitress was friendly and prompt. But 2 things bugged me. None of the food was really that great. The cacciatore was $40, but I don't know why. It lacked flavor, & I used the salt shaker a good bit. My wife felt the same way about her meal. But what truly bothered me was the older woman at the door. She was so proper and overly professional in her demeanor that we felt unwelcome. A smile goes a long way. The place was packed with diners. So people must like it. But I can't understand why. It's really just an okay place. There are tons of other great restaurants in town to choose from."}
{"text":"Had a delicious homemade pasta dish last night. The tomato basil sauce, wow!! And the zucchini appetizer was so light and also delicious!"}
{"text":"This review will be as short as our time at this place last night. We walked in hoping to grab a drink and some food around 7pm. The place was dead inside with maybe 3 couples... and there were at least 4 waiters and waitresses and a bartender standing around. We passed a few dirty tables while we made our way outside, which just sat there the whole time. We went and sat at the table outside, which was directly across from the bar. Multiple staff members were standing around by the bar... doing pretty much nothing. The couple at the bar even noticed we were never greeted. Not one staff member came over. We gave it about 10 minutes and walked out. Basically I can't comment on the food or anything they serve here but their customer service alone will eventually shut this place down. Terrible. And obviously bad management."}
{"text":"I've been in PGH 7 years and never had the urge to visit Peter Allens. Then they got a modern makeover and on a blustery day, I shuffled in from out of the cold & decided to test them out.   It's really gorgeous inside- clean and chic. Before our entrees arrived, a basket of mixed breads arrived at our table with butter. When we ran out, the waitress asked if we wanted more, which was unexpected but nice. My SO and I are both vegetarian and I ended up ordering fettuccini alfredo and he got mushroom ravioli ($19/plate). My alfredo was rich and delicious. The noodles were cooked to perfection. I hate an overlooked noodle so I pay close attention to that. Like most Italian places, the plate of pasta was huge. The mushroom ravioli my SO got was also delicious but we decided my dish was the winner. The entrees also come with your choice of soup and salad. The salad came it with a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan, a nice touch.   I kind of didn't want to like it there. It's a little more $$ than I usually like to spend eating out... but I know we'll be stopping in there more regularly now. In the future, I think we'll actually just split the fettuccini alfredo entree and that will put the restaurant back in our price range for a quick bite to eat before or after a show."}
{"text":"Food was great but the hostess is a serious angry grandma. Steer clear and do not think you can sit at the bar or a table without her crabbing at you. EEK!"}
{"text":"A night at the theater as usually to begin with what was SUPPOSED  to be a wonderful dinner to welcome my daughter and her boyfriend back from a year working abroad but NO \"Carol the hostess\" immediately changed that plan. Reservations had been made days ahead but her greeting to us was condescending, beyond rude and totally inappropriate as we merely asked about a table near the window and she replied \"see that Reserve sign\" well yes we saw it and when we said well we have reservations she went into a rant explaining what reserve meant.  Treating my daughter, who I'm sure has been to many fancier, international and domestic restaurants than this awful woman has ever known, as though she were a person who just walked in from the street to beg a drink with disdain. With that we asked to be seated outside. She begrudgingly took the three of us to a too small table with the continued rudeness. Ok so we are seated and hopefully at least the outside service and food would outweigh her horrific attitude but we were totally wrong. We should have known the mistake we made when even the server said she was so used to Carol's bad behavior. Now bring on the good service NO the server barely had time for us. We tried to order oysters and even though it was only 6pm they were out of that appetizer. So with a 10 to 15 minute delay in serving two simple glasses of wine we order the entrees. We order still hoping to save the experience only to have one of the most disgusting examples of even good  dining we have all seen. Bring on the overpriced chicken special, another pasta dish that was edible but not great, and a salad that looked as though it was thrown on the plate and bread that was so hard one could not bite it but had to take it apart to eat. Get the picture? There was no picture and I regret we did not take a picture especially when the cappuccino came. The cup in which it was served looked as though it came from an all night diner with drippings and coffee grounds all over the saucer and cup. I won't even mention that the people next to us had to ask to borrow the balsamic dressing and cheese from our table because the server also neglected them.. What a night, thank goodness the play was excellent and we do have alternative restaurants near the theaters that we attend regularly! Oh funny story at the play I was talking with a person next to me who asked if we go to dinner prior to the plays and I said yes but NEVER again to Peter Allen's. I told her about Carol and she laughed and said \"Oh Yes we know about her\" and not in a good way. Over priced, poor service, most importantly poor food quality and presentation all describe \"The New Peter Allen's Italian\" top that all with Carol and you have a sad addition to the Cultural District.  So changing your name, putting in new tables ( which are too crowded) has not helped one bit. Will I return to this place? An emphatic \"NO\" until a new establishment replaces this one in more than name only."}
{"text":"I will never return to the restaurant....waited over 30 minutes to get my soup and salads for the table. Then waited over 50minutes for the entrees. Food was subpar had to get the manager because our party of 4 was disappointed in each dish. Wait staff are unprofessional"}
{"text":"ZERO stars - the manager/owner is such a nasty lady. Absolutely NO customer service, communication skills, zero tact - NOTHING!   I personally stopped into the restaurant to make a reservation (1 week out).  The friendly bartender wrote down my spot in the reservation book.  I stopped by again, one day out, to add an additional person - SO GLAD I DID. My reservation was not in the book.  The manager/owner working the reservation desk was extremely RUDE and unprofessional.  She not only insulted my intelligence (I must have gone to a different restaurant), she would not call her bartender to validate the reservation, & most important she would NOT apologize.  She only said \"What do you want me to do, pull a table out of the ceiling...there are worse things in life than losing a reservation, people are dying of cancer.\"  WOW - that's when I walked out never to return.   ABSOLUTELY unbelievable!  Time for the old lady to retire!  People - STAY AWAY!  Even though it's across the street from a performance venue - go anywhere but Peter Allen's. And honestly, the food is overpriced and below average.  Take the extra step away from the theater and eat where the customer is appreciated and will have a delicious meal."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever encountered. After being seated, we waited 35 minutes (and that was after I spoke with the hostess) to have water served. They were out of nearly everything on the menu. Once the salads arrived, I realized that they had also neglected to give us flatware. They so disorganized and clearly untrained. Absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND. There are a number of other great restaurants just down the street."}
{"text":"We were very lucky to get a last-minute reservation for our party of 11 on the Saturday night of the Pitt-Penn State game. The maitre D' was excellent, and gave us our choice of 2 table arrangements. Extremely slow service is the only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars. The entrees were excellent at our table ~ for me, the best veal Marsala I've ever had. The waiter could use a bit of polish, but he won points by comping our table with 2 excellent desserts to make up for the wait time. I'd definitely go back, and would look forward to having that veal Marsala again!"}
{"text":"Remarkable! It is absolutely remarkable that an entree that would be perfectly average at $8 should cost four times as much. The $32 sea bass consisted of two dreary rectangles of poorly filleted, bland white fish adorned with parsley. College cafeterias do this dish better. It was by far the most disappointing restaurant meal I have ever had."}
{"text":"Are there on 6/18.    Entree and salad were  okay but not great.   The dessert, Death by Chocolate, was more like paper cut by chocolate.   Very disappointing.    Overpriced for this micro portion of gelato.   A Fancy Fail.    Service was fine.   However, the greeting was basically rude.   We were told we needed to be out of our table by 10 minutes of 6.  Really, when has anyone told someone they NEEDED to be out except for closing time.    Overall experience is worthy of a never return."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Disappointed they had no bread to go with our meal.  Said they ran out.  When  you are paying a good price for a dinner you would think they would have plenty of food.  We had made reservations at least a week in advance.  Food was not hot.  Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"We choose this location to have our annual family birthday dinner.  It was really good.  We started off with three pasta dishes as our appetizers. We had the pappardelle bolognese, spaghetti with meatballs and the linguine pierto.  All delicious!  Meatballs were melt in your mouth. Everything was fresh.   I ordered the stuffed shrimp, it was ok nothing special but others had 24oz porterhouses, black and blue filet and the seafood platter.  Omg the steak was amazing, cut like butter!  The lobster on the seafood platter was huge, that's what you were paying for.  All meals came with a nice salad.  We ended dinner with bread pudding.  That was very good too!   The chef came out and was very nice.  Checked on us twice.  Everything was very fresh!  I would go back and try another dish!"}
{"text":"We went by the Google rating and landed up for some pasta at this place and within the first 5 mins of us being very indifferently greeted and seated at the bar by the hostess we realised it was a bad bad decision !! I ordered a basic pasta with olive oil and garlic and it was so oily and terrible !!  The service is terrible with the staff lost in their own conversations ..  Lesson learnt - Never coming back here !!"}
{"text":"We weren't going to stay but the hostess was so dear we did. Our server Courtney was delightful. Our food was delicious. It took a little while to get our main dish but well worth the wait. I don't think they cook tons ahead. I felt like our meal was cooked to order and perfection. Courtney brought bread and butter quickly. Mine came wit a Christ salad and hubby's veal stew was scrumptious . I can't imagine the negative ratings. If you want quick Italian.. go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends (10 black African American women) for a birthday dinner yesterday night and couldn't believe my dining experience. This was my second time eating there and what I thought would be a great night of food and drinks with my friends turned into a disaster quickly. Not only was the service poor but we didn't get our food order taken until after 9 pm (we got there before 8pm). They failed to mentioned in that hour that they were out of the NY strip steak which half the table had decided on and also were out of a lot of sides. To top off the night an intoxicated guest walked past our table and threw up on us and our table. Nobody including our waitress said anything to us even after we had told them what had happened. They never checked on us and waited at least 30 minutes to clean up the throw up off of the floor that was at our feet. We were completely appalled by the whole night and it's series of events. We will not be back to Peter Allen's!"}
{"text":"The fact that we could get a reservation on a theater Friday should have been a clue!  The main issue last night was NO WORKING BATHROOMS during dinner service!!!  They should not have been open.  Unacceptable.  Food was mediocre and service the same.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I wish I listened to the reviews before coming.  Dirty bathroom doors. Bugs were flying around our head the entire meal. The food was completely mediocre and I lost my appetite before I started to eat. I can't even finish the post because I don't really want to waste anymore of my time on this establishment. Just stay away, like I wished I had."}
{"text":"there are no words for such horrible treatment   watch my video   https://youtu.be/vh3sc4le-cs  Watery sauces and I was told no bread or garlic bread here at all . This is no Italian restaurant with a name like Allen   We sent back a watery masala sauce entree and were told they've been doing things the same way for 20 years   Then we were told to leave and never come back by the owners brother no less  There were 10 or so other customers listening as he yells at us in a condescending fashion   The waitress seemed like she was abused by a domineering boss   Other yelp reviews explain this joints dining disappointment   They need to close shop and leave town  as they are an embarrassment to pasta and tomatoes  Universal bad experiences here"}
{"text":"Probably a fine place to have a drink and appetizer after the theater but as a restaurant very poor.  Calamari is frozen restaurant supply quality; Veal Piccata was bathing in a watery sauce and was over cooked.  Bread was stale.  NY Strip was cooked properly but was very tough.  Sautéed mushrooms came to table nearly raw and had to send them back.  Go to Vallozzis on 5th...wonderful Italian food and great service."}
{"text":"First let me say this is not the place for a quiet dinner. Patrons are shoved into little tables and practically sit  on top of each other. Over priced, mediocre (at best) food.  I had Pepperadelle and it  was  bagged egg noodles. My friend had lobster ravioli that were obviously frozen as they were stuck together very fishy and cold.  The service is terrible. Glasses (both wine and coffee) had food and a gelatinous substance and waitress with attitude when we requested new. I had something in my wine and she states, It's just cork, took it over and fished it out.  Both coffee cups that we received with dessert had a gelatinous substance all over them and she was put out that we asked for new cups.  The pecan ball is an 8 dollar chocolate syrup sundae.. small bit of ice cream with some pecans and chocolate  syrup squirted on, bit of whipped cream. Just horrible. Avoid at all costs as there are so many other better restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner here! Enjoyed chicken parmigiana last night!!The food is delicious! The regular menu is great, accompanied by nightly chef specials! Never disappointed with my choice! The decor is modern & comfortable.  The diningroom & bar are beautiful ! The cocktails are great! The waitstaff is efficient, even at the busiest times. The dining room is supervised by a sophisticated, friendly hostess. She always makes us feel welcome and appreciated! Enjoy a lunch, dinner, or after the show meal! You will become a regular!!! An added perk ... very close to Cultural District theaters!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here even though there weren't many people in the restaurant. That seemed odd as it was a Saturday night and busy downtown. Here's why:  they need a complete overhaul of the front of the house. Too many seats, too formal without the trained staff to support the attempted ambiance.   The food was very good so it's obvious the chef knows what he/she is doing. I would overhaul this place into rustic Italian, train the staff, get rid of the white leather or remove half of the seats and upgrade he wine list.  For the prices charged there's just not enough quality upscale service to support them."}
{"text":"First. We had a reservation for 7 pm but they called my sister-in-law, asking if we would mind moving to 7:30 because it would be more comfortable dilute to the plays. They knew we were not going to the play so they wanted our table for a play goer. Thought they would offer a complimentary app. Nope. When we were seated the place cleared out and it was the 6 of us and 2 other tables. I ordered the linguine with red clam sauce. The pasta was too soft and there was very little clams. One of the ladies ordered a steak that turned out too rare for her.  It seemed that we were an afterthought when the play crowd left. We should not have agreed to a later time. Maybe the meal would have been better. We go to a lot of events in the cultural district. This restaurant is off our list for return."}
{"text":"Food was good but surprised no sides served with your meat entree. With being an Italian place would have been good to have a small spoonful on the plate ..,just meat doesn't taste good"}
{"text":"Hair in my soup. And subpar welted salad... i decided to deny the main course and get the hell out of there lol. The lack of attention to detail was concerning. So i didn't even attempt the main course (lobster Ravioli) couldn't get my mind and stomach to stop picturing the hair inside/on top of the ravioli. Especially if it comes out lukewarm like the chicken soup.   I was in town on Business from San Diego... a very reputable \"meat\" place within walking distance of this subpar place restored my opinion of quality food in Pittsburg!!! They managed reservations and seating better also....  i saw so many upset customers while seated...do citizens in Pittsburgh have to come in and argue with owners about reservations like this daily?! Sheesh that place was stressful, you'd think they would create a better system. Atleast someone was able to sit at our table's when we left early. I just didn't complain, denied the main course, paid for everything and wished them farewell!!! #NeverAgain"}
{"text":"My family and I ordered take out from this restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful inside and the staff was very nice. The food was great my husband and children enjoyed their food and I did as well. I didn't know that anchovies were put on caesar salad so they were on there but I just picked them off. I was not a fan of the dressing. There was nothing wrong with it I just personally didn't like the tastes of them. It was nothing that was there fault. We got food from them August 16th, 2016 and we were very pleased."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Pork chop special with cannelloni bean and aioli last night.  The presentation was out of this world only to be topped by the awesome flavor.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great ! Newly remodeled, food is solid. Carol is excellent at the door and Sean incredibly attentive at the bar.  I live in Chicago and travel quite a bit- this would hold its own anywhere"}
{"text":"Ate with three people; none of them liked their meal. That's pretty much all you need."}
{"text":"We had 4:45 reservations on a Sunday night.  Show at Heinz was at 7pm.  I ordered Chicken Piccata - which was good, but only came with a salad.  Over priced and not worth the money.  I don't mind paying for a good meal, but after I had my salad, the dinner came with 3 pieces of chicken on a plate - nothing else..."}
{"text":"WASTE OF MONEY!!! I will give this place one star because it was clean and the interior was lovely. However the food was almost in edible. What they called a vodka sauce looked like it was made from tomato soup. On top of squishy frozen ravioli. And the $20 salad my companion ordered, had canned mushrooms and peppers on it which made the salad limp and soggy. The tomato was so pale and grainy it disintegrated paired with this soggy mess. I was actually angry that I made the mistake in going to this place. It really ruined our night out. It's obvious why they had so many open tables."}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks before a dinner elsewhere and enjoyed ourselves so much we stayed for 2.  The place is newly remodeled and has a nice atmosphere.  We had martinis and they were extremely well made.  Stirred, not shaken.     The bartender was friendly, but does something that seems to be the new trend among restaurants and retail shops.  Even though they are waiting on you, if a co-worker starts talking to them they totally drop what they are doing with you and focus on their co-worker.    The Pittsburgh symphony was on strike, so some of the musicians sat in the restaurant and played.  It was extremely enjoyable and fit well with the atmosphere.    We had nice, friendly customers around us, so all in all, a good stop.  The restaurant was packed with what looked like many regulars.  That should mean something."}
{"text":"If you like mediocre food,  you will not be disappointed here. English spots Romano was on the menu. One might think if something is on the menu, someone in the kitchen would know how to prepare it. Nope! The entree initially served was deep fried fish. After being sent back, the next attempt was pieces of fish with something white and cheesey melted over it. The hostess even said she was appalled when she saw the dish that was now being served. But, she let it be served. It was all white and pasty looking. It was also tasteless. A third try produced some fish, finally resembling something \"romano\". But you could see the grease shining on the fish. Another entree ordered was scallops. These were tough and rubbery. Absolutely no care was taken to make any of the dishes appealing looking, either. Both dishes were each $30. The only food that was anywhere near decent was a baked potato. And that was $8. I do not mind paying for good food, but it is appalling to pay so much for such mediocrity.  A restaurant can change its name and redecorate, but in a foody town, this mediocrity is pathetic. Like the two previous evaluations, we will never go back."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST restaurant I have ever been to.  Let's just say I didn't even get to the main dish before I RAN out of there.  The hostess, whom did not even greet us at the door, wound up at our table after we requested to sit closer to our party.  She plopped herself down at our table, commanding one of our guests to \"MOVE OVER\", complained about her sciatica, before rudely asking \"Now, who wanted to see me?\"  After listening to HER making extremely blatant unsettling remarks about women & denying our request to sit closer to each other, my party left."}
{"text":"Wow.  Such terrible service. Sat at bar.  Bartender, who later identitfied himself as the owner, did not offer any specials, never checked after the meals came out and was too busy schmoozing with some of his regulars to make sure we had the bare basics in service.  We would have ordered more drinks, but he never checked back in. Then threw a public fit when we told him the service was sub-par.    Food was decent, not wonderful.  Service was a zero.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here 90 minutes before a play.  Started to worry a bit when it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. We asked if we should just order an appetizer since if the food will take as long we will run out of time. We did order the meal and made the play at the first call chime. Food was good. The atmosphere was very pleasant. You could carry on a conversation since there was no loud blasting music like most dahntahn restaurants which are primarily TV bars. Will go again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go here again. We were over charged and the waiter made derogatory remarks about women!  First, we (6 women) were greeted indifferently by the owner, as if she was doing us a huge favor by seating us. We were there for an early dinner after a show and the place was empty at that time.   Our waiter was obnoxious. He kept suggest we share things. That really bothers me. Also he often mixed things up. He'd say they were out of a certain wine then come back and say he was mistaken.  As we were waiting for our dessert, we heard the owner tell our waiter, \"We need to get these ladies out of here.\" We had been there an hour but this was not our fault. We were only wait to be served.   The waiter came to tell us that there was only one ice cream roll (2 of us had ordered that). One switched her order. However, he brought random desserts to both women who ordered the ice cream roll!   When our checks finally came, they were all wrong. We politely asked him to adjust them and he argued about who ordered what! I assumed he wouldn't charge my friends to whom he brought random deserts, but he actually charged for both desserts! When he gave change, he short changed one friend then argued about it and yelled, \"I'll never split the check for a table of women again!\""}
{"text":"My husband and I were headed to see the show \"Million Dollar Quartet\" at the Benedum. We totally forgot to make reservations. UGH. We drove down hoping someone could squeeze us in. We started walking and found ourselves drawn to the aroma coming from Peter Allen's. we asked if they could possibly seat 2. The food gods opened the sky and showed us favor. We had a nice table right by the window. It was fun watching people walk by to dinners and shows. We let the server know that we were theater bound. Our server did not disappoint.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with fresh pasta as my side. Where do I begin???  The pasta was fresh made and pillowy soft but not mushy. I could have eaten a portion of just that. However it was topped with huge plump shrimp. They were generous in their serving of shrimp. The shrimp and pasta were tossed in a Scampi sauce that was outstanding. You could taste the butter, white wine and the fresh garlic. Thankfully I had Altoids so that I didn't carry my garlic breath to the theater with me. My husband wanted to try mine but I didn't want to share. Then I saw his dish and traded food. He had Chicken Parmesan. Holy Cow!!  It was two huge pieces of real chicken that were juicy and fried perfectly. They were topped with some of the best marinara I have ever eaten. It was full of flavor and the perfect consistency for this dish. Then it was topped with gooey, melty cheese. It was like the icing on the cake. Speaking of cake they had fabulous choices for dessert. Everyone around us was ordering it and it all looked delicious. I was so full I thought I was going to have to roll to the theater. I asked if they would be open after the show because I would have gone back for dessert. Sadly they weren't going to be. That's ok though because I'll be back to try more dishes and I'll save room for dessert. Great service, great food, and a beautiful dining room = 5 stars"}
{"text":"We happened into this restaurant after checking out two others, which were both loud and crowded. Peter Allen's was like an oasis--courteous service, lovely music, quiet enough to converse, friendly patrons at the tables near us. The food was quite good, especially the pasta. We had one problem (fish too salty) which was kindly and promptly replaced. The portions are generous, and the desserts were the perfect size for us, ample but not huge. Service was efficient and we had plenty of time to get to our show. Overall a very positive experience."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I will never return.  This place attempts to be upscale but lack the quality to do so.   Service was beyond slow and I had to keep asking to have more to drink when I could find the waiter.  The food is à LA carte and I paid $8 to have a side of pasta that was the smallest portion I have ever seen.  Definitely not the Italian way! Very disappointing and not worth my money!"}
{"text":"From the time we checked in with the hostess to verify our \"reservation\", to the time we spent at the bar waiting for a cocktail  TERRIBLE  SERVICE.... Food was \"average\" Wait staff substandard. There are DEFINITELY BETTER Restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian food I have ever eaten. The lobster ravioli was definitely something that you get out of your freezer section of your local grocery store. The lobster in it had a not so fresh quality taste to it. The fried zucchini wasn't cooked long enough. The chicken Romano had no seasoning/flavor to it. It was like breaded chicken tenders with no seasoning, with a lemon wedge. The bolognese sauce tasted like marinara from a can, and the noodles were not homemade. Over all quality of the food was POOR. The best part of the meal was the iced tea. Went to Wendy's for a frosty afterwards! Would definitely not recommend, and will not go back for a return visit!"}
{"text":"I have lost my faith in Pittsburgh yelpers... How can Meat and Potatoes (with its satanic \"hostess\" and manure smell) get 4 Pittsburgh yelp stars while this gem gets only 3??? I understand thats its across from Heinz Hall and depends on theater traffic but this is a hip, art deco eatery with fabulous food and hospitable, Pittsburgh people! I was pretty frazzled and upset after storming out of the nastiest dung heap of a restaurant I ever saw (Meat and Potatoes) and this place was my oasis... The food was FANTASTIC!!! I challenged our agreeable server by going off menu and he never batted an eye! I ordered capellini but I insisted on garlic butter in the gravy, with extra hot sausages on the side and the meal was culinary MAGIC!!! It was so good that I actually wept tears of joy all over myself... And the onion soup was made with a highly unusual chicken broth that really complimented my entree nicely! And the sensual jazz music (that played the entire time we were there) really rounded out the evening nicely... It was like eating in the Cotton Club. Do yourself a favor and ignore the 3 Yelp stars and make a reservation here! You won't regret it...."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and was disappointed.  The decor was clean and uncluttered with a black/white color palette and bright (way too bright for fine dining) fluorescent lighting that was reminiscent of a hair salon.  I came early for my reservation and sat at the bar while waiting for my friend.  Bar was clean and well stocked and the bartenders were competent and friendly.  Once seated for dinner we were greeted by an enthusiastic and knowledgeable server.  Unfortunately for her the restaurant makes her serve food on cafeteria dishes.  They were ugly and old.  Not quite sure how an allegedly new restaurant has old \"family restaurant\" style plates.  That would be ok for say Grant Bar in Millvale (which is actually a great place to eat - go there) but not for dining downtown before a show.  Appetizers:  crab stuffed mushrooms - they were good.  Nothing special, slightly greasy and bland but not offensive in any way.  Fried zucchini- really good.  Fried perfectly with a nice marinara on the side.  Unfortunately the marinara was filled to the brim of a cafeteria cottage cheese/apple sauce dish and dripping over the side.  Really sloppy plating.  Salad: basic side salad.  Fresh greens.  Your garden variety family restaurant salad.  Entree - Veal Romano.  It was a suspiciously large portion of three sizable pieces.  The plate was grease splattered and was not plated with any elegance.  Upon cutting it I realized that only two of the three pieces were veal the other being Chicken Romano.  The chicken was actually better than the veal and I was thankful I had it as the veal (which I didn't finish) was over-breaded and soppy with grease.  Got mashed potatoes and broccoli as a la carte sides.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm, tasteless smashed redskins with ne'er a pinch of salt for flavor.  The broccoli was steamed, poorly cut into shrubbery sized pieces with large brown spots on the stems.  Completely inedible, unappetizing and should have never left the kitchen.  This wouldn't be served at a hospital yet at Peter Allen's it's an a la carte side.  It's absurd to complain about food being yucky and then in the next sentence complain about small portions but the a la carte sides were in those cafeteria cottage cheese dishes they love so much.  This is NOT an a la carte portion -at least not one you would get at a premium steakhouse, but the charge was similar and in my opinion a disservice to diners.  Dessert- Salt Carmel Truffles.  This was really good and I was happy our server (who again was really nice and deserved to work at a better restaurant) recommended it.    Overall this was a poor dining experience and I won't go back.  (Two stars only for the staff - otherwise it would be one). Putting the wrong protein on a plate is a serious no-no and the rotten broccoli was scary.  The prices are lower than many other restaurants on the block, but it's still fine dining prices and they do not deliver a fine dining experience.  I was happy to see Bravo Franco go away and get replaced with something new because this is a great location and the city deserves a great place here, but it's menu is uninspired, dated and the food is slop.  Basically Bravo Franco with a fresh coat of paint.    If you are seeing a show and do not have a reservation to any of the really good restaurants in the cultural district and need to just walk in, I would advise to stick to appetizers and dessert."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal I have eaten in any restaurant in Pittsburgh!!!!  Took a friend there for lunch for her birthday - the Mushroom Ravioli was terrible - floating in a brown liquid that was supposed to be a sherry cream sauce and Fettuccini Alfredo with sauce that was oily and tasteless!!!  The fried zucchini appetizer was average at best!!!!!  $80 later, neither the manager nor the chef were the least bit apologetic or compensatory!!!  Save your money!!!  There are much better pasta places in and around town!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Treated me and my friends terribly. Said blatantly racist comments to me and my friends while denying easily accessible requests of pushing tables together. Disgusting establishment. Do not go here."}
