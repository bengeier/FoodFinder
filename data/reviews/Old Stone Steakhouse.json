{"text":"For the past year I've come to Old Stone about twice a month for lunch. At first, the soups and salads were delicious and the prices excellent. In the past few months, however, the prices have increased and the portions have shrunk quite a bit. At first they just cut back on the amount of toppings on the salads (smaller portion of salmon, less steak, etc) and that was a bummer but now they've even decreased the amount of lettuce! I don't understand that. I might as well go to Panera and get a much larger, much tastier salad for half the price. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steakhouses in NC and it's a gem in the small town of Belmont.  The atmosphere is perfect.  The staff are pleasant, great outdoor patio and the restaurant also is able to capture pieces of that great Belmont charm.    Being from NC, I'm a big fan of pork and Old Stone does their pork chop right!  I make the trip down from Charlotte every few weeks just to satisfy my cravings.  They're also on point with the prime rib and filets.  Old stone has a great bar as well.  It's not large in size but the specialty cocktails are great.  Plus they carry local NC brews, which is very important to me.  Some people have suggested that their prices are a bit high, but I think the prices are relevant for the quality of food you receive.  Yes, the prices are a bit higher than some other places in Belmont, but I can guarantee you that you're not receiving a similar experience or great tasting food.  This place is great and definitely worth the visit even if it's not in Charlotte.  I think you'll be surprised and you'll find yourself coming back for more."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day weekend. We had a reservation, arrived early and was sat right away.  Our wonderful server, (Olivia) arrived promptly as did our drinks. We ordered the shrimp Brochetta 5 stars! The crab & lobster filet 5 stars! Prime rib 5 stars! Dessert chocolate cake 5 stars! We loved our entire experience and will be back soon for sure.   oh and the decor was so nice. Loved it."}
{"text":"I have been to the Old Stone about a dozen times. It's been OK. I usually ordered something other than steak since they do not serve USDA Prime. The meals were usually OK. I once tried their Signature Black and Blue Sirloin just to try it out. It was OK. But last night 8 of us wanted to celebrate a small occasion close by our home in Belmont so we all got the higher end steaks. Score: 6 steaks, 6 disappointments. I was the only one spoiled by the higher end Prime but everyone else in our party was let down.   We got there early on a Wednesday night and the place was not crowded so that was not an excuse. My son and son-in-law, both chefs, knew right away that the steaks were not cooked to timed order. They were put on the grill the moment the cooks got the ticket then put under the salamander until we were done with our salads. When that happens our rare steaks still cooked a little too long and became medium rare. No juice on the plates at all is also another sign. Hardly anyone else was in the place. Could they have waited 7 more minutes? How long does rare take anyway? My son had to send his fillet back because it was overdone.   The second problem was that 3 of the steaks were tough. Really tough. My dad's rib eye did not even look like a rib eye cut. It was only 3/4 in\" thick. Our other 2 bone-in strips were the worst steaks we ever had. I know I should not have ordered a strip in the first place if I want super tender but it was bone-in and prepared in their signature fashion and was assured it was mouth watering.. Again, mine was an inch thick and my son-in-law's was an inch and a half. Both 18 oz. What's up with that? Even Bi-Lo will cut me 1.5 inch steaks. How do you even cook a 1 in steak rare?   So the cut, the preparation, the quality of the meat all get failing grades. I thought a place that bills itself as a steakhouse - even serving USDA Choice - would at least be as good as say Outback. It wasn't."}
{"text":"Great setting and cozy, warm atmosphere.  However, a semi fail on food.  Go to a real steakhouse if you want a nice piece of meat cooked properly.  My 'medium rare' filet was actually cold inside still.  (Med rare should be at least warm and pink, not cold and red.)  The side of potatoes were also cold.  We sat at a high-top in the bar area.  Bartender needs to learn some manners and realize who pays him...the customer!  He was just grouchy and said the minimum possible for us to be able to place an order.  His service was terrible for someone that I believe has made a career out of bar-tending.  He was talking to the table next to us (folks he clearly knew) when we were about to walk out and he didn't even say \"thanks\" or \"see you later.\"  Just POOR customer service. In summary, decent atmosphere but food and service need some real help.  Ill try them one more time to see if we just had a bad night."}
{"text":"I so very much want this restaurant to be good.  Last evening my husband and I gave it another try after a year.  We made a reservation for 6:30pm and arrived about 6:20.  The hostess advised that our table wasn't ready so we were fine waiting in the bar area over cocktails.  The bar service was super, despite being overcrowded.  By 6:40pm, we noticed that several couples were being seated immediately upon checking in, and then realized that the hostess had forgotten about.  Pretending that she hadn't forgotten, she seated us immediately at the worst table in the restaurant.  We actually got to greet patrons before they got to hostess stand from that point forward.  Our waitress however was excellent.  Knew just when to be at the table...just had the timing down and was extremely pleasant and competent.  Unfortunately, we experienced another mediocre meal.  The steak is just not steakhouse quality but it certainly has steakhouse pricing.  We get better steaks at Food Lion and regretted not having just stayed home and grilled ourselves.  This was our 3rd attempt to enjoy Old Stone.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Everything was great except the steaks.  The lettuce wedge salad was excellent and the service was good as was the atmosphere. My wife had a small fillet that was just ok. I had a NY strip that didn't look like any NY strip I've ever had before. It was 1/2 inch thick and looked like a breakfast steak. There are way better options for a steak at this price."}
{"text":"the worst time of my life in this place, went for lunch. ordered the piled high burger, so overcooked it was the size of a hockey puck and just as hard with two pieces of fat laden roast beef $10.95 are you kidding me. hair in the salmon salad, fishey crab cake the worst food ever. then the manager had the nerve to say well there was nothing wrong with the drinks, i wish i new who owned this place, the worst manager ever, i live and own a small business in belmont, and if i treated my customers the way we were treated i would be out of business."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. My ny strip was cooked to perfection. The macaroni and cheese was phenomenal.   The manager/owner? even came by and topped off our bleu cheese chips."}
{"text":"Very good!  Crab and corn chowder, Cesar, sirloin and grits. Friend had the scallop appetizer and creme brûlée. Also very good. The chocolate creme brûlée was good but not as exciting as I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this steakhouse last weekend and were sincerely disappointed by it.  After reading the other yelp reviews, I was expecting a nice juicy steak and what I got was a bland and undercooked one.  I ordered my steak medium and received it rare.  How could I tell that it was rare and not medium cooked?  Well my husband ordered his steak rare and mine was cooked a lot less than his was.  Regardless of it being rare, it was just not flavorful at all.  The only flavor that I could get was from the cheese that was added to it.  My husband's steak was lacking in flavor as much as mine and the only thing you could taste on his was the Danish blue cheese sitting on top of it.  I'm sorry to say that the best part of our meal were the dinner rolls which were actually very good.  It is very safe to assume that we will never be going to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Where do I begin???? We had a reservation but had to wait regardless; that's not a big deal. I think the worst part was the service. The people were nice , our server was nice but not only did she come to our table at least 50 times to see how we were doing she basically rushed us out of there. We ordered apps ( calamari which was overlooked, crab cake was good and fried pickles), server took my husbands plate away before I finished eating, etiquette is you remove all plates at the same time. Anyway, as soon as we finished the apps, the plates lifted off the table the wedge salad came, again 20 times the server came by to ask \" everything okay\" and off she went. She was taking away my husband's salad while I was still eating mine. We felt rushed and not sure why as there was no line for seating after we sat down . Main meal, husband had the prime rib which he said was no big deal, I had the tilapia which was salty and so thin you couldn't tell where the tilapia ended and the mashed potatoes started, seemed like all mashed potatoes. The food was salty, should have to be if you flavor it correctly.. While we were still eating our main course the server asked us if we wanted dessert, mind you WHILE we were still eating our dinner, I responded not sure if I could fit in a dessert , she said no problem we can take it to go and while we were still eating dinner, she plopped the wrapped piece of chocolate cake on our table! My husband already said no way going back there. Shame though, I thought we had found a good restaurant fairly close to home, not so. Also, parking is horrible, so if you are going there on a weekend better be prepared to walk.  Don't think we will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Wait time sucks. Small and rude people. Girls more worried about talking then helping. Wouldn't wast your time."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very well decorated and looked great. That is the only plus.  The server clearly had better things to do than take care of us.  He was very dry, only checked on us once and it was obvious he hated his job. The food was way less than average.  The chicken was very dry and you could barely cut through.  There was just a squirt of  the \"infamous Cheerwine BBQ Sauce.\"  The salmon was overcooked on the bottom but rare in the middle.  We barely ate our meals and the server did not even ask why, just asked if we were finished and then took the plates away.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not a pretentious food-snob, really! The food was fine, but this review is mostly about the service. I'm sorry, but I had to ask to be waited on three times before I could get a waiter to come over to us. On top of which, I ordered a martini and several glasses and a bottle of wine. This was not an inexpensive dinner.  The service was TERRIBLE. I couldn't even get a waiter to come over to us--I had to ask two different servers to send someone to our table.   Food was great. My parents got the wedge salad and loved it. My NY Strip was excellent and cooked perfectly.  Get control of your waitstaff, please."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with their overpriced peach cobbler.  Paid over $11 (+tip) for their peach cobbler that is supposedly made for two people and highly raved about from the waiter.  It was mostly breading with maybe two peaches and tiny.  Not even really much for one person considering its nothing but breading.  HIGHLY disappointed for we came back just to try this.  I'll post a pic and one should def. stay clear.  There are better deserts in Belmont.. String bean and Nellies for much cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Date night... Halloween... Bacon wrapped Scallops appetizer and wedge salad was great! Highly recommend the pineapple martini! Service was great. Worth the trip to Belmont!"}
{"text":"Ordered pricey entrees and wine. Food was good but more than halfway through the meal I had to ask why they don't serve bread/rolls with dinner...was told they don't unless they are asked! What?  Yeah because they throw out too much. So...I spend $70 00 on dinner and I have to know to \"request\" dinner rolls."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Old Stone Steakhouse for while, and from the outside it looked promising.  Service was great, atmosphere was very nice, but the steak was a huge let down.  I ordered the RIbeye and asked for medium-well.  Now a Ribeye should have some fat on it, because fat is flavor!  There was not a scrap of fat on the steak.  Also, I've bought thicker cuts of Ribeye from Walmart.  The steak was thin, rubbery, overcooked, and flavorless.  The only flavor came from the giant glob of butter they put on top.  The fresh mixed vegetables came from a microwavable bag I watched the waiter dump on my plate at the pass.  If you are looking for a great steak in Gaston County, I recommended heading up the road 15min to Stanley to true Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Have noticed the service and food going downward.  We had to wait for our lunch for over 40 minutes and then when it came part of the order was wrong.  I had a grilled veggie club and part of the sandwich was scorched.  The waitress was nice enough and the waiter was great.  Not sure what is happening but hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Rarely do I enjoy a restaurant enough to write a review but Old Stone is one I'm happy to vouche for. I lived in downtown Charlotte for several years and made a point of visiting Old Stone at least once a month.   I would recommend the 8 oz. filet or black and bleu sirloid if you want something with a little kick. While it may be a bit pricier than chain restaurants it's well worth the price and still very reasonably given the quality.Great staff starting from the owner, very friendly and makes sure you're enjoying your meal and overall expereince, all the way down to the busboys. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and felt it was time to write a quick review.    The good: The Bacon wrapped cheerwine BBQ scallops were fantastic. We love them.  The steaks were cooked as ordered.  Service was friendly.   The not so good: The service was slow The cut of meat ( sirloin) was average at best, and slathering a big chunk of butter does not cover for quality.  The first baked potato was old and overcooked  The second baked potato was very overcooked, I gave up after two. I figure if they can't get a potato right with two attempts , I'm done.  The martini was under-poured, not chilled properly, and sloppy. At $12 in Belmont , you need to try harder.     Try harder Old Stone, take pride in your food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I have ate here countless times and it has always been perfect. Amazing atmosphere,food and service. My husband's  favorite day is Wednesday, when they have all you can eat crab legs. But really everything I have had from the menu was great."}
{"text":"$15 for mozzarella sticks????  Bless your heart.  This is Belmont and that's ridiculous.  We love to support local businesses and love upscale and fine dining, but that is ludicrous."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte area for a few days and decided to visit the Belmont area. This place is a great place to eat. The service was excellent and the prices are reasonable. 4 stars because of the parking."}
{"text":"My finance and I had a 'couples night out' coupon from Old Stone and decided to make the drive down to Belmont on Saturday night. It was packed when we got there, so we sat at the bar and had a drink before a table became available. The bartender made really good (strong) drinks so I have to say I would rate the bar service much higher than the overall experience. When were were seated, the waitress immediately asked us if we knew what we wanted to eat. We politely told her we needed a little more time, but she came back about two minutes later to check back in on us. We ordered a wedge salad and the goat cheese for starters and were disappointed. The dressing on the wedge wasn't very good and instead of the traditional bacon topping, they served cranberries on top of it, which was odd. The rest of the meal was just ok. My steak was over cooked and my the peanut butter dessert tasted like it was out of a box. Steve had the pork chop, which was the only wonderful thing we had last night. The website advertises 'five star dining'. I have to disagree and we probably won't go back to give it another try."}
{"text":"I was dining alone on a business trip.  I am picky but had an excellent time.   The service was above par for the price.  They take Amex.  I had the crab cakes and a loaded sweet potato.  Could be the best sweet potato I ever had.  Crab cakes were good - not the best I ever had but they were still good.  Rolls were fresh and I liked the butter.  Place was clean, well staffed, and had a nice elegant but not too stuffy atmosphere.  I would done again if I am in town - the pic of the crab cakes is mine - after I had taken a bite."}
{"text":"We visited for the 1st time last night.  Food is good but a little pricey.  We sat outside on the patio and it was nice."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after a very long day. The patio was amazing, and made for a great spot to relax and have a casual meal. Service was fast and friendly, and price fair. The food was somewhat lacklustre, but passable for the price and locale."}
{"text":"The food was just okay and certainly not worth the price. Nobody at our table of eight was particularly impressed. The service was good."}
{"text":"This place nails it. Great food -- from appetizers, salads, steaks, sides, desserts, beverages. Great service -- the right speed and drinks kept full. Fair prices. Great ambiance. If you are in the area and want a steakhouse meal, this place will more than fulfill the need."}
{"text":"I think I will have delicious dreams about that filet mignon for the next week.   The service was fantastic. We came on a Saturday night with something called Nashville filming a scene across the street so needless to say, the place was PACKED.  Despite my initial feeling of extreme claustrophobia because my group decided to try to squeeze up to the bar for a beer during the week, the entire wait staff was smiley, friendly, and the hostess managed to find us several times to update us on when we would have a table. Our waiter was quick, attentive, friendly but not over-talkative which is my idea of excellent service.   Now, the food was AMAZING. I ordered a filet mignon with mac & cheese and a wedge side salad. The dressing on my salad, a sherry vinagerette, was to die for. I practically licked the plate clean. Then, my filet showed up right on time, medium well as requested, and it melted. in. my. mouth. Beyond delicious. I mean it, I will dream of that steak. Then, the side dish of baked mac & cheese was fantastic. Melty in the center with a variety of cheeses, topped with baked, crunchy crust with a hint of bacon. I have paid 6 times as much to eat this exact same meal at Morton's and I would choose this place first every single time.   The atmosphere was just as wonderful as the food. Lively, buzzing, casual. When the hostess showed our party of four to a table right in the center of the restaurant, I wasn't thrilled. I much prefer to be in a booth or off to the side when I'm in a group so that I can hear the people I'm sitting with but not feel like all the tables around us are in one big conversation because we're all so close together. However, we didn't have that problem at all! Whoever set this place up must have had the acoustics in mind because it was slam packed in there, and it was loud, but it was just the right amount of loud. We were still able to have great conversation, hear every word, but enjoy the fun atmosphere too.   Needless to say, I will be back here SO MANY TIMES. Mmmm.. filet mignon dreams.."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ate here only a couple of times and disappointed both times. The food isn't worth the price. We have no problem paying for good food, we just felt this was an overpriced outback sreakhouse."}
{"text":"PROs. -Food: Very tasteful, I had the lobster and filet mignon, Service: Very good, Wait time: 15minutes, Ambience: fair, Dessert N/A did not try Price: $$$"}
{"text":"Not the best place. The menu was not very clear about the ingredients of the Mac and Cheese. Forgot to mention that it had jalapeño and swimming in oil. It took 3 time to get my steak right. First time was very rare, then well done, they got it right the 3rd time with a new steak, I was only asking for a medium steak. Not going back."}
{"text":"filets here are great. I rarely eat steak, but when I do, it's a filet. I love that they have sweet potatos rather than the traditional. overall, great place to grab a steak."}
{"text":"Average- nothing special- and certainly not worth the 140$ dinner for 3. We had read many positive reviews about The Old Stone Steakhouse so we were excited to try it. We were pleasantly surprised at how crowded it was on a Thursday evening, thinking this was an indication it might be a hidden gem. Our waiter was attentive, charming., and honest  about the menu items. I would say he was the best part of the experience. Considering the interior could use an update and better lighting. We ordered two vodka martini's and they were served in beer glasses because the restaurant had run out of traditional martini glasses. The charming waiter - said \"sorry about the glasses- Welcome to Gaston County\". We should have left right then!  We stayed and ordered the ribeye, prime rib, and salmon. All of which were served with a traditional wedge. Oh wait.....except no blue cheese or bacon crumbles which in my option is the best part of a wedge. The lettuce was not fresh and had a few brown edged.  Disappointed again!  The steaks were served as ordered, my daughter loved the salmon (yeah)! Nothing spectacular- and even though we are local we are not planning on a return trip to Belmont's Old Stone Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Good food, cool 'old town' feel.  Like the Belmont area, nice to find this restaurant for when I am in town.  A little pricey though..."}
{"text":"Best steak in Belmont  Good sandwich's and sides. Quite versus the Belmont restaurants"}
{"text":"I visited Old stone about a year ago and it was excellent.  I used to get the filet tips and grits, and they were so flavorful and delicious.  However, I recently went there, and the food was absolutely terrible.  For an appetizer, I got the spinach and artichoke dip and it was gross; they decided to put lemon in it which just ruined it my opinion.  Then for an entree I got the filet tips and grits just as I had in the past, except this time it was terrible, totally flavorless.  I will not go back to Old stone again, its slightly overpriced and now the food is atrocious.  If you are in that area, go to Sammy's Pub right beside Old stone, there food is great!"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Overpriced, supermarket cuts of meat and rude customer service.  You could honestly get a better steak at the likes of Ryan's or Golden Corral.  I'm amazed people like this place so much."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I ordered the pork and asked for it medium-well. It was still quite pink when it arrived, but my waiter quickly took it to the back and when he returned, it was cooked perfectly.  My friend, who frequents this restaurant said that they have a habit of not cooking things as much as you'd like. It was really only a minor inconvenience and it wouldn't deter me from eating here again. The sweet glaze on my pork was delicious, and the sweet potato fries were among the best I've ever had; a little sweet, a little salty, and not greasy at all. The kale and arugula salad was very good and dressed perfectly. The goat cheese and pita appetizer is great for cheese lovers. The pineapple martini is also worth mentioning.  It wasn't too sweet like a lot of drinks with fruit in them can be.  If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick night out at a slightly better level than an Applebee's then Old Stone is for you.  Not a good place for a nice night out with a bottle of wine and quality food.   Pretty disappointed with Old Stone Steakhouse.  We moved to Belmont almost two years ago and kept saying we needed to go there.  We took advantage of restaurant week to try it out.  We wanted to make an evening out of it, so we got there about 30 minutes early to have a drink at the bar, everything was fine with that and we were seated at our table before the time our reservation was set for.  We had the worst table you could get, right by the front door/hostess stand.  It was not all that warm out, so every time the door opened you and your food were hit with a blast of cold air.  My two star rating would not be higher had we gotten a better table.  They were out of the prime rib, which we sort of expected they would be, but still hoping they would have it.  We got the ribeye instead.  Our salads came out very quickly, but we weren't even half way through our salads and they brought out our entree, there wasn't even enough room on our table for all the food.  I ate a few more bites of my salad before giving up on it because my entree was getting cold every time the front door opened.  My whipped potatoes were freezing by the time I started on them, I asked for them to be warmed up.  They were certainly whipped potatoes, it would have been nice to have spoon with them, they wouldn't stay on my fork when i tried to eat them.   Overall, the food wasn't great, certainly not worth the normal menu prices.    We felt like they were trying to turn over their tables as quickly as possible.  We had planned on ordering a bottle of wine, but when the waitress saw we already had drinks from the bar she didn't even give us the option for another drink.  Plus, our food was there so quickly we wouldn't have even had time to order a bottle.  They didn't seem interested in letting anyone enjoy a night out at their restaurant.  We even over heard one of the hostesses tell a family waiting that the table they were supposed to get just ordered a bottle of wine and she couldn't ask them to hurry or to leave, but that they (the waiting family) could stand over them to make them feel rushed.  That pretty much sums up how we felt as well, get in and get out."}
{"text":"Here is how Old Stone Steakhouse managers and owners can destroy an evening. Their booths are set up back to back love seats (if you will). These two seated seats are connected back to back. BUT! They are not bolted to the floor! So, when you move to get in or out you move the entire assembly to include the other patrons attempting to enjoy their dinner behind you and then all of a sudden, a \"wave\" comes by and shoves the booth seat to the left and right. OMG! This couple got so agitated at my friend twice because he rose up from the seat and shifted his wife while she was eating. I told the man not to get mad at us but the establishment. I told the two hostess about this when I departed but I sincerely doubt they passed it on. In other words, fell on deaf ears. This is restaurant 101. BOLT DOWN YOUR SEATS managers and owners! Duh! Visited on March 10, 2018. Waiting for the food took waaaay too long. Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"The steaks were WELL prepared. Half priced wine was a good touch. The mash potatoes were very basic but the salad and steak were on point."}
{"text":"Excellent rib-eye steak , perfectly cooked to my liking, very nice and fresh wedge salad, excellent beer selection!"}
{"text":"This place must be lucky. When I first interviewed in Charlotte for my current position, I ended the evening at the Old Stone Steakhouse. A short time later was when I got the offer! It's been approximately 2 years since that night and returning recently was just as sweet.  They offer a great, relaxing atmosphere. I went with co-workers and we chatted over 2 hours about business matters and we never felt rushed.  I got the salmon salad for lunch and it was very good! Everyone else ordered a different salad and by the end, we had eaten all our greens! Yum. Maybe I'm used to eating carbs like crazy, but I was hoping that they would serve some warm bread with our salads (like I remembered during my last visit).   Overall, great restaurant in a nice area! Service was good, salads were yummy!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Belmont. This is the only place we go to get steak now. Never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Getting to the point, great service, nice place, fair price and one of the best steaks you can find around this area!  This was not the first time we ate at this place and the service has been always great and consistent. Never had to wait long for our, drinks, food or anything else we needed. My husband made a reservation for NYE, they were packed and we called one day ahead but they got a way to squeeze us in.  We got there 15 minutes before our reservation and our table was ready for us. We ordered our drinks and placed an order of shrimp and lump crab dip with toasted pita. The pita was warm and crunch and the dip was divine!  I had Ribeye steak with salad and fries, my husband had cheese grits with sliced sirloin. They serve the best steak ever! I can't get any steak house to serve me a decent medium steak and they do it perfectly! The steak melted in my mouth was pure pleasure! My French fries were ok, nothing special about them. My husband enjoyed his meal a lot. I forgot to mention the edge salad we had, was good too, they make good ranch dressing. After all of this food we had no room for dessert! They've always impressed me how fast they bring your food no matter how busy the restaurant is.  My goal is to try all the different cuts of steak they have. This being said I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife ate dinner here one night and it was very good. We had the crab cake appetizer and it was delicious. The salads were huge and and fresh, maybe to big. I had the ribs and the meat fell off the bone and were awesome. My wife ordered the fillet and was very impressed. Personally I did not find it that expensive pretty similar to long horn. I would recommend it. Ok I have been here a few times and it has been pretty good never had a bad meal. I don't like the outside seating area the chairs just are not comfortable. The prime rib is delicious and I really enjoyed the lobster bisque.  This place is not huge so I would recommend reservations so you do not wait forever. They have the Jail house cigar bar right next door now and it is a great addition."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Old Stone for a while and was expecting the same great experience.  I was pretty disappointed.    We had the boneless buffalo wings as a starter.  They were beyond hot (three mile island style).  Since there were no choices of how to order the wings, I was expecting mild or medium at most.  We had to ask for blue cheese / ranch as well as rolls.    My wife had the filet, which she ordered Medium and came out rare.   It was mediocre at best.   Honestly have had better at Denny's.   I got the filet tips and Cheddar Grits, which were a huge let down.  The tips and grits were covered in cheese and sauces, which is what I was expecting.  However, the tips themselves were untrimmed and had huge pieces of fat. The dessert was a let down as well.   We shared a Peanut Butter tower, which turned out to be two tasteless pieces of chocolate cake with peanut butter piped on top.  It reminded me of the sad little desert that you get from a healthy choice dessert box, only less taste. My recommendation: Save yourself $40 and go next door to Sammy's."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and have found myself ordering the same thing every time...the ribeye. I am one who enjoys a medium rare steak and Old Stone has done it right each time. Enjoyed the patio during the summer and the cozy feel in the inside during winter. If you are a sweet potato fan, I would reccomend getting a side to split.   I guess I should be better about changing up my menu orders, but its hard to change from a well cooked steak.   Ill be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Dont go for lunch unless you have all day to kill. The place is slower than mud running up hill. Food was ok. But so far only waffle shop and oldstone have pictures of entrees on the wall. May be a Gaston County thing. I wish we went to Sammy's"}
{"text":"Today is a nice autumn Saturday and this restaurant has been on my bookmark list for some time now. Almost went to it the last time we had Queens Fest aka Charlotte Restaurant Week.  We got there a little afternoon and were promptly seated, menu's presented and drink orders taken.  Quick review of the menu and I had decided on the French Dip.  Server comes back a couple of minutes late with our drinks and informs us that they are out of Prime Rib. I asked if that translated to no French Dip and when she said yes, back to the menu and time to formulate Option B.  My wife decided on the Fancy Grilled Cheese Sandwich minus the fried egg and a side of asparagus. This is a combination of both Gouda and Gruyere Cheeses.  I went with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with a side of steak fries.  While we waiting, i took advantage of surveying the restaurant. Nice clean archtecture with modern lines while keeping some of the historic feel of this being the former police station. Good feel and I like the lines.  Lunch came out and while my wife liked here Grilled Cheese Sandwich, my Buffalo Chicken was a big disappointment.  The Chicken was overcooked and very dry and while it had been sauces with Texas Pete, it had very little heat to it. The Blue Dressing was very runny and I could not pick it up and eat it without making a big mess.  The Steak Fries were a generous portion but unfortunately they were under cooked with poor texture.  Service was very good I  must say.  All in all, nice atmosphere and service but nothing special or noteworthy in terms of the quality of the food.  Menu is impressive an there might be better items on it, but I did not find them."}
{"text":"What an excellent restaurant, the menu is basically unlimited. The NY strip was beyond perfect and excellent quality. The setting I compare to any 5 star steakhouse, the server was excellent.  Just a week ago we visited Ruth Chris, the total meal for basically the same items we ordered at Old Stone was almost four times the price although the quality of the food at Old Stone seemed superior.  If I could change a few things, my beer wasn't as cold as I would have expected, not a huge deal, it was pouring rain outside, not like anyone can control that, lastly they are and maybe it's a good thing, not as close to my home as I would like, if they where I probably would eat there all the time.  The location in Belmont is a real surprise, such a small town having a restaurant of this quality made me realize it's worth checking out more small towns in the area.  Will we be back, you can bet on it.  If you are not sure or on the fence, read all of the reviews, Old Stone lives up to all the excellent comments and you would be missing out if you didn't go enjoy."}
{"text":"I am so stunned at the negative review.  We frequent here often and it is hands down the best Steakhouse in Gaston County and I'm a food snob.  Service is usually Great sometimes a newby can be slow, I have tried it all and the only thing I can say is they could work on their desserts.  Their Bombay Martini is great I get it Extra Dirty."}
{"text":"A small local place. Small town feel. Greeted immediately on entrance. Sat in the small bar for a beer and then over to dinner.  We were seated but were holding an impromptu business discussion. Kandace was our server and very patient.    We got two 6 ounce steaks which were perfect sized, priced and cooked. Salads were very good with the homemade ranch. Our guest ordered a buffalo chicken salad and liked it. Wish they would have held the steak order until we could have finished our salads. We were about half way done when the steaks arrived. Good wine and beer list."}
{"text":"For it to be called a steakhouse, there certainly wasnt a lot of flavor. I ordered a bleu cheese steak and it tasted like nothing... no bleu cheese flavor, no steak flavor."}
{"text":"For Queen's Feast the first restaurant we tried was Old Stone Steakhouse and I'm so glad we did! For $30 you get a 3-course meal complete with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Also on Monday's apparently bottles wine is 1/2 off and they have a very nice selection. We ordered a white zinfandel.   For my appetizer I ordered the Sundried Tomato & Goat cheese. It's served with herb infused olive oil and toasted pita bread. I typically love both all of these ingredients but I didn't particularly enjoy this dish. For whatever reason it seemed too sweet for my liking. I changed it for a Ceasar salad. It was just \"ok\" but edible.   I ordered the Thick-cut Ribeye and loaded baked potato for my entrée and was impressed beyond my expectation. I'm a huge steak person and this was a great cut of beef and it was flavored well. It was cooked to a perfect medium well and was not burned or dry. The potato I think was overcooked but I was mostly focused on the steak anyway.  Dessert was great! I had the raspberry-chocolate drizzled cheesecake and it was amazing! I'm not sure if it was homemade but it was certainly better than restaurants that \"feature\" cheesecake.  The server was phenomenal. She had a great personality, was knowledgeable about the wines and food and provided her honest opinion. She didn't hover but was very attentive and pleasant. If you eat here, ask for Jessica, she'll take good care of you!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse was a little out of our way in Belmont, but hubs had a whole date planned around the Chinese lantern festival, and it included this raves about steakhouse.   Belmont is a really cute town to visit anyway, and this steakhouse didn't disappoint with its charm and comfortable atmosphere. Our waiter was very friendly and the staff was sweet.   We started with drinks, and they were delicious. I got a martini and hubs had a fancy old fashioned. Both tasted delicious and were mixed really well. For dinner, I opted for the shrimp and crab pasta and hubs ordered a steak. We were both very satisfied with our choices.   The prices are a little high and parking is limited, but there's a free lot very close to the restaurant. If we are ever in the area again, I would return :)"}
{"text":"We went for the first time the other night for my girlfriend's birthday. i went under the impression that this was more of an upscale restaurant, probably because i heard they were a tasty steakhouse. It isn't as upscale as i thought. For example, the patio area featured a neon Bud Light sign and one group actually had a dog sitting under the table.   Anywho, we sat on the patio area and ordered a Surf and Turf (8 oz. filet mignon and came with 5 shrimp) with mashed potatoes. i thought the filet was just good, but i thought the shrimp was excellent. The lady friend loved the mashed potatoes.    We also tried a tasty burger with steak fries. The fry seasoning was delicious as the other review said, but i thought it seemed like a small portion of fries overall. The tasty burger was indeed tasty with jalapenos, pimento cheese and bacon.   The coolest thing was the special we saw on their Web site. During your birthday month, you can get 1/2 off any dinner entree! Crazy good deal. Of course we reinvested that savings in a martini and beer, but that works for me."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst food experience I ve had this year.  I had the clan soup / chowder first and about two bites into my trout dinner I was running for the restroom.  I doubt it was the trout because I only had a couple of bites but the destruction it did to my stomach was wrenching.  Food poisoning at its best! I had always heard this place was good but my experience was horrible."}
{"text":"My niece and I decided to try this place because she got a flyer in the mail.  Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and deserts included for $59.  We thought it had to be to good to be true but it was not and the food was amazing.  The portions were not small and we ended up bringing desert home for later.  Unfortunately for my waistline the cheesecake made a wonderful late night snack.  I would definitely return again, and again and again if I lived closer.  Next visit to North Carolina I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was only going to give 2-stars but added a 3rd because of the lunch menu.  I've only been in once for lunch but it was an overall good experience and I thought the price was decent for the food.  But the food is just okay--as far as steakhouse dinners go in this price range, you can do better.  The location, atmosphere, and service are all good but not exceptional.  If my husband and I are going to spend this much on steaks and prime rib, we're going to The Woodshed in Stanley."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience! Comfortable and cozy! Wait staff was very active. The steak was pretty damn good. And the sides...OMG...amazing! Definitely will be back soon! Bring your friends and enjoy a night of food and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Great meal and excellent service.  Appreciate the small (6oz) fllet option.  Sometimes portions are so big, it's wasteful.   We also ordered specials... the Alaska cod, which was crisp, light and not greasy or overdone.  The duck was a treat and nicely presented.  The wedge salads are great and be sure to ask for the bread, which was a highlight of the meal that added a slightly sweet flavor to the mix.  The service was outstanding.  Even though they were busy (Prom Night!) our server was patient, warm, and sincere.  She was the icing on the cake.  It was refressing to be treated like your business is valued and made to feel welcomed.  There are many good restaurants in Belmont.  The service sets this one above the rest."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat! The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy, and food doesn't get any better than this. The lobster tail and filet mignon is amazing, along with the stuffed mushrooms. The menu has something for everyone, and the food is made fresh to order.   My husband I went here for Valentine's Day. We went for an early dinner, so it wasn't too crowded at the time. I will have to say that the service can be a little better. Our waters ran empty about 3 times (we were thirsty) and we had to ask to turn the fan off 3 times (we were freezing) only to have them turn it on again halfway through our meal.   All in all, this is a wonderful place to eat! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with a large group of family for lunch and this was the only place that could accommodate such a large group. From these reviews, I had very low expectations. However, it wasn't as bad as I had feared.. For one thing, the porch where we sat was really nice.. It is pretty and has heaters and a pretty electric fireplace which is nice. Our waiter was also great. The food was definitely over priced but not awful..  I expected it to be so horrible from the reviews that I just ordered fries and coffee. But from seeing everyone else's food, it definitely didn't look horrible. The burgers were cooked medium rare exactly as ordered. They weren't anything special, but definitely not awful.  It was weird because they were out of prime rib and it was only noon, so I'm not sure how that happened. Overall, we were pleased because 16 of us could sit and talk and all hear each other and sit in a pretty place. The food was overpriced but not offensive"}
{"text":"The food was great!   Had the Twin Peach Pork Chops with sweet potato.  Marvin was great and the atmosphere was very pleasant and not too noisy.  Great meal and a great price!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and was a little hesitant to try it but we had tried all of the surrounding restaurants.  We had excellent service and a great mill.  The filet was so good and tender.  We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"i went to old stone last october for lunch. we sat outside on the patio, it was kind of a chilly out but they have fire places that were on that made the patio very comfortable and provided a nice ambiance.  i had the rib eye steak sandwich which was fantastic. the wait staff was very polite and attentive.  overall it was a great experience and i plan on coming back next time im in the area."}
{"text":"There is hardly a day that goes by that someone from our company isn't taking a supplier or an out of town associate to lunch here. I have had some disappointments but never felt that compelled to write a review. Until now. Yesterday, at lunch we had a group of 14 and I ordered a BLT. I think my 7 year old grandson could have done a better job of assembling this sandwich. The iceberg lettuce used was the thick white ends, a huge piece on the top and bottom. Two very small slices of tomato. The 4 pieces of bacon were all stacked on each other in the center. Two of the bacon slices had a third of the slice nearly uncooked. Since the sandwich was cut corner to corner, when you picked up a side most of the bacon fell out.  Being with a large group I was not going to call out the lame attempt of sandwich making... what a disappoinment."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to go based on the reviews but we decided to take a chance. We were NOT disappointed as the service from Steven was awesome and the food was great! They make their salad dressings in-house and are delicious. The steaks were cooked perfectly for everyone at the table, which speaks volumes if you knew my mother. A short drive from Charlotte but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"One of Belmont's culinary treasures continues to bring excellent dining and service to a grateful town. The wife and I made a last minute decision to go out for dinner and decided to go to Old Stone Steakhouse since it is a short stroll from our house. As it turns out we made it in time to get the \"early bird special\". Your choice of five or six entree choices along with choice of salads, sides and desserts for $13.95. While their shrimp & grits is hard to pass up, and their 1/2 rack of ribs is always terrific, we both chose the 12oz. ground steak smothered in homemade pimento cheese and sauteed onions drizzled in a wine reduction. The wedge salad was icy cold and delicious with homemade blue cheese dressing, bacon, craisins and shredded carrots. The ground steak entrees were cooked perfectly and you could tell they were freshly ground steak with a coarser texture and not hamburger meat. Along with the baked potato \"all the way\" there was just too much food to finish. We ended up taking 1/2 of the meat home (for the dog ;-) ) along with our desserts. Our server Alex S. was perfect in his service, repeating our order and tending table without being invasive. I highly recommend Old Stone Steakhouse in Belmont as the food and service never disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been to Old Stone several times, and I'm pretty surprised to see some of the poorer reviews on here.   The food is good quality and priced fairly for that quality as well. The atmosphere is that of a traditional steakhouse.   Most entrees come with a wedge salad (you can also pick a different salad and whatever dressing you would like).   I've had many good steaks here, and the specials are usually very good too. I like their salmon as well.   Overall I've always had decent meals here that I have enjoyed, and the service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"Did the Wednesday night all you can eat crab legs. Although the crab was good it definitely wasn't all you can eat.  They ran out relatively early in the night and wouldn't give a discount even after asking.  What the heck!!!!  That's just crappy service.  Won't be back and now i understand the lower than stellar rating for this place.  Much better places around for less money."}
{"text":"I'm really not understanding why people have given such poor reviews of his place. I travel to the Charlotte area for work form the West Coast and always go here and the String Bean in Belmont.  The atmosphere is a normal steakhouse vibe. The staff had always been very friendly to me.  I personally love their BBQ chicken breast with onions. It comes with a wedge salad which I prefer dressed in blue cheese. The toppings came with crunchy onions and craisins. It's like dessert before dinner.   The beer and wine selection is very nice as well.  I'd recommend his to anyone."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place!  Great deal during restaurant week with three courses and a bottle of wine per couple.  Great decor and the building is the old police station.  Everything from the appetizer to the deserts were very tasty and lavish!  I highly recommend this small town gem in the heart of the cute lil town o belmont!   Enjoy yelpers!"}
{"text":"The reviews are accurate.  Food is undercooked and overprices.  Calamari was undercooked and over salted.  Salads did not have sufficient dressing (Caesar) and the wedge is weird with the cranberries and potato strips.  Blue cheese dressing was watered down.  Note- this place has a history of undercooking their food.  It is true. If you want medium, order medium well.  Potatoes were undercooked.    I read a review where the manager defended the quality of their steaks.  I am a butcher's niece, they might THINK they are purchasing \"prime\" but it is not.  I could not chew my prime rib.  No we did not complain, nor ask for another steak...it was our anniversary..just what I want to do is prolong a bad meal.  We paid, left and got dessert at Lotus.    If you want a nice dinner with good food, go on to Charlotte or maybe one of the hidden gems in Gastonia. Steaks at Logan's are of better quality. This is more of a \"see and be seen\" restaurant in Belmont.  It is still in business because there is nothing else for these people to go to that has the upscale décor. Sammy's and String Bean have excellent food, but they don't have the atmosphere these people are looking for."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary dinner at the beginning of January. We had gone the year prior with an amazing experience and decided to celebrate their again. We were put on an enclosed porch which was a little cold in my dress. The waitress was very inattentive. There was significant delays between table visits. The first mistake was the wrong drink being brought to our table. I ordered champagne and got pink wine. Then I ordered my filet medium well and it came out bleeding all the way to the edges of the meat. I was upset but was hoping they'd recook it for me. However, our waitress had a party of 15 that she knew and spent the majority of her time with them.  She finally came after 20 minutes to check on us and by then my fiancée had finished his meal. I didn't want to wait to get my dinner redone. It put a damper on our big night. Unfortunately, will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere, casual or dressy, it's your choice.  The food is very good.  It's expensive, and you will have to decide if the expense is a value or not.  I like to eat here when I want something good but do not want the drive to charlotte.  This is by far, the best option for fine dining west of the   Catawba river.  I had the ribeye tonight and it was good, not great, but we'll seasoned and cooked properly.  The wedge was very good.  I have also had the half rack ribs on two occasions and it is one of my favorites with its cheer wine BBQ sauce.  Overall, the place is a hit."}
{"text":"One Saturday afternoon we decided we'd check it out.. it was booked out w/reservations for 6pm or later- it was 430 pm They did give us a table but it was directly in a walk way. One seat like booth w/ chair pulled up to it.. it was a terrible spot to seat anyone considering it was basically empty. But we didn't have a reservation. We ordered our steaks..I like mine medium rare & husband likes Med well. They both came out so rare we had to send them back.. then when the waitress took both steaks back we heard the cook let out a holler.. You've got to be kidding me!! My husband turned around trying to get the cooks attention but the guy never looked his way.. thankfully he didn't come to our table. Once we got steaks they were ok but we won't be back.."}
{"text":"Only been here once, but the food & atmosphere is pretty good. Much like most of Belmont, you're going to pay a good price for the food, but this warrants the price. Although I think they put too much into the presentation of the food, it's full of flavor & usually is enough to fill you up.  They have a nice patio area that is covered and they have a couple tv's outside. The bottled beer selection is extensive, along with their wine list, but I can't seem to understand why they have 0 beers on draft. It seems that a nice steakhouse would have a nice draft beer to go along with your meal, but maybe that's just me.   And being located next to Sammy's & in the heart of downtown, you can walk to another bar after dinner or to the stores in downtown Belmont."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit to Old Stone and it was incredible. Our food and drinks were perfect and our server, Steven, was amazing! We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"We hit up the Old Stone during restaurant week (yes, another tardy review - sue me).  The place was hopping.  What I do not know, since I am not typically this far out, is if they are usually this busy.  I am going to guess not, but it is really tough to say.  Whatever the case, the service suffered a bit.  They were friendly, but they were really slow.  In a more upscale steakhouse, that might not be bad - but here you have an upscale vibe, set off by the televisions and casual porch, so it really needed to be a bit faster.  At least they kept the bread coming and brought out the wine quickly.  As to the food?  It was passable.  What I found really interesting was that here we were, at a steakhouse, and the steak was probably the least interesting thing on the menu.  Not bad at all, but the chicken was easily the best thing we had on the table.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender - possibly helped by the Cheerwine sauce - and the nearly bite-sized dessert portions finished things off well.  I just wish that the steak could have held up its end."}
{"text":"Had big expectations and was sorely disappointed.  The lettuce wedge salad was weird, the bread grainy, steak was overcooked and it was very hot inside.  The elevator music blared and our waiter had the personality of a bath mat.  Same verdict as The Woodshed - just pass it by on the way to Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I cant brag enough about this steakhouse. A few of my friends went last night for restaurant week an to celebrate my friends birthday.  We arrived early an normally for Queens feast you are seated at your reservation time only. That was not the case they hostess got our ready anyway  Being queens feast its 3 courses for 30.  We all knew what we were ordering lol The first course was either Caesar salad , Scallops wrapped in bacon an a homemade Cheerwine sauce Salisbury NC is my hometown thats where cheerwine is from , a little Trivia for ya lol  I ordered the Goat Cheese with Sun roasted tomatoes an pita points . Oh my that goat cheese with those sun roasted tomatoes in the olive oil  was incredible the goat cheese was very creamy add the pita to it melt in mouth.   They had a salmon, Ribeye , Prime rib now you know we all got the Prime Rib with Hot Au Jus an smashed potatoes an gravy. They did not cut corners for queens feast it was a 12oz prime rib if I'm right . The mashed potatoes were smooth n creamy made out of new potatoes luv it . For desert they only offered 2 a coconut cake an chocolate layer cake. My friend had been some time ago an said they have an amazing key lime pie. Sometimes the places will accommodate you with another desert some charge . We had the best server if you go ask for Chelsea she knew the menu an our food was coming out on time an she cleaned our table quickly to prepare for desert . Chelsea I hope your appreciated by the manager you rock Chelsea said they no longer had the key lime pie but they had key lime cake an wait for it a Pecan sorta cheesecake . Most of us ordered the pecan cheese cake it was a crust out of graham crackers an brown sugar an the cheesecake was perfectly made with the pecans on top with a brown sugar .crumble. I will be back its a cute place , great atmosphere an we were even just talking after we stuffed ourselves an they were not rushing us out the door . We all live in Charlotte but its only a 20 min drive to belmont take a short hop, skip n jump go try this place an ask for chelsea."}
{"text":"Lovely classy place in Belmont. Nice place to bring out of town guests. Can compare to any charlotte restaurant quality. Good steak. Sides and drinks. Worth the stop !!  nice patio. Can do large groups and parties"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our twin toddlers for dinner last night and it was one of the best meals we have had in a long time!  Jessica was our server and she was exceptional!  She knew the menu top to bottom and talked my husband through the steak temperature that ended up to be absolutely perfect!  She was attentive but not intrusive.  She is really great at her job and I was so impressed that I complimented her to her manager.  The food is yummy but her service made our night!  You should go and ask for Jessica!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Old Stone a couple months back with my in laws and my parents.  We picked this place because we had all been there before and been pleased so we figured how could we go wrong? Well when the only person who ordered steak at a steakhouse had the worst meal that's pretty bad.  I love a good steak so that's what I decided to get and I ordered it medium, it came out very well done, almost felt like I had to saw through it.  So I was gong to send it back but after 10 minutes of waiting for our server to come back and check on us and my family half way through their meals I just decided to suck it up and eat it.  After dinner we were just sitting around waiting for our check we were discussing our meals, and it's bad when everyone else agreed that's why they didn't order a steak because its rare you'll get a good one at Old Stone.  So upsetting Belmont has a steakhouse that can't fix a good steak."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Steak cooked perfectly  and great wine on menu. Nice atmosphere for a small town steak house. Server was great. It was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"What a romantic place to dine!   The steaks are the center piece of their business.. However, my sister in law bought a lobster tail filled with beef and veggies. Surf & Turf with veggies if you will.  The appetizer was delicious fried calamari!  Fresh and crispy!   I had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Very tender and juicy!  Mashed taters were awesome!  Service was excellent and menu has plenty to offer a finicky eater!"}
{"text":"Well it had been a while since our last visit to old stone ! They have their mojo back the food was great and service was spot on. Glad to have Old Stone back as a place we can enjoy a great meal at ! My only gripe was that they removed the shrimp cocktail from the menu. They will make you a shrimp cocktail if you ask for it though ! Sure hope Old Stone can keep the great food amd service going !"}
{"text":"My new husband and I were recently married at Daniel Stowe Botanical Gardens and reserved Old Stone for our wedding reception - we served approx 120 hungry people for lunch.  And I must say, I have never worked with such an amazing, laid-back, organized team as the two Matts (managers).  They were more than willing to accommodate our every wish and were able to make very helpful suggestions of how we could make it all become this bride's reality.  The event turned out beautifully, the service was on-point, the drinks were stout and the food was the highlight of the entire day.  Our guest were treated like royalty and I've heard many of them returning as individual diners only to find the same great experience and service.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND OLD STONE STEAKHOUSE FOR ANY AND ALL OF YOUR DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS."}
{"text":"The wedge salad was good.  I had read the reviews about the steaks being bad so I ordered a burger.  It was okay but the waiter was the WORST!  First, he got my order wrong and then did not bring me any condiments.  It was a large party of 20+ people but he was the worst server that I have ever had.  He never came back to refill our water glasses and never asked if we wanted dessert!  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Old Stone came highly recommended but fell a bit short. The steak was great and definitely worth the trip but the sides and other aspects really struggled. The wedge salad to start has little dressing and too many cranberries and other random toppings that nobody wants. The fries were fries but the ranch dressing they serve tasted off, maybe it's a location thing but clearly the ranch had an added flavor that just wasn't right. Drinks were drinks but it did take 3 tries for the waiter to get us actual sweet tea. Overall I go to a place like this for a steak and the steak was pretty great, they need to shore up the rest of the food and aspects to really get to the top."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We have the wedge salads and prime rib and salmon.  Fantastic!  The key lime cheese cake was also divine.  Great service and they were very busy also.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Drove from Mooresville, booked a hotel to stay in town to have dinner here and I ABSOLUTELY would  do it again!  One of the best meals I've ever had. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I try to go here about once a month and the food is wonderful every single time! one of my very favorite things is the wedge salad. I always get either the Filet or the Tasty Burger, both are amazing! I would love to get my hands on their recipe for the cheddar grits!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to! The steaks here are amazing! The service, ambiance and food are second to none...some of the best food I've ever had. I recommend the Fat Tire beer cheese wedges and the Southern style Filet."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I went got the \"All you can eat crab legs\".  They were very large and tasted great.  Probably the best I ever had.  Our server  \"Eman\" was excellent.  She was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first experience with this place was shortly after it opened. It was terrible. So terrible in fact, that we boycotted it. The service was horrid, the food lackluster, and the management? I won't even get started on the lack of professionalism there. We didn't go back for nearly 3 years. Then we heard about the crab legs, so we gave it a shot again. Great crab legs, great service. We thought they had been redeemed. 2 weeks ago, we took our family there for a family night out. We were going with the intent of having the crab again but were told that they no longer served it. So we all ordered steaks. My mother and I both got the ribeye. My daugher went for the NY Strip. I ordered medium, daughter medium, mom medium well. What we got was: Daughter rare. I got medium rare. Mom got medium rare. And the staeaks themselves were tasteless, non descript, lumps. Terribly tough. I liken chewing it to chewing grape nuts. You keep going and going and going but you don't know why. Both my mom and I ended up not eating ours. Yeah, that bad and I LOVE ribeye (normally). The server was terrible, the food was worse. Boycott is back on. Its way way too pricey for the quality. Its not worth it. I would rather spend the money and go to Chima or Outback. Better food, better service, better attitudes."}
{"text":"After vacationing in myrtle beach we were spending the night in Charlotte before catching a flight home the next am.  We had terrible dining in myrtle beach.  This place was amazing.  First off it was restaurant week which we didn't know, plus Saturday night.   They were able to accommodate a party of 5 with only a 20 minute wait. And it wasn't because they weren't busy.  We ordered a variety foods.  For starters some had wedge salads and others had soup of the day. The soup was a corn crab chowder.  The soup was to die for.  It was delicious.  Entrees varied from steaks, to chicken to pasta.  I personally had the pasta.  It was one of the best pasta dishes i have ever eaten.  And I have eaten a lot of pasta.  Steaks cooked perfectly.  Very tender cut of meat.  Nice selection of sides. We were so full we were unable to try dessert but the menu looked very good. The wine was from Napa.  It was a great dining experience.  I would plan a lay over in Charlotte again just to go back.  Very good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"While picking up an antique desk from a neighboring business the boyfriend and I decided to stop for lunch. Walking in we liked the choice in music, lighting and overall ambiance. The host said hello and quickly sat us. As our server took our order I was informed that at 3PM on a Saturday a 'steakhouse' was unable to fullfill a prime rib sandwich. I decided to go with the Texas Burger with a wedge salad with no balsamic, while the boyfriend did the French Onion Burger attempting to order a standard dinner salad and was informed they didn't have one. (I found this and the fact there were no steaks available on the lunch menu rather odd.) we ordered with no issues. This is where the cooks come in... One wearing a TShirt reading 'underachiever' immediately began asking how to prepare the food all while dancing around, cursing and making quite the scene. In the meantime my boyfriend had unrolled his silverware to discover an extremely dirty fork, which our server kindly exchanged for a different one. To the right of us was the host stand & fellow booths. I noticed it seemed to be the powwow area for employees to eat, watch tv, complain about poor tips and other nonsense guests do not have any business hearing about nor witnessing. Whenever someone would approach the host stand, with her mouth still chewing food the host would conduct whatever business was needed. She then would immediately walk back towards the booth with her fellow employees, making faces at them to bring home the point that she was annoyed to have been bothered. My burger, while cooked correctly was missing some of the toppings stated in the menu, it was extremely bland and dry. My boyfriend loved his, said it was very juicy, flavorful etc minus being slightly over cooked from the desired temperature. (Hence why I am giving two stars VS one).  I have worked in the restaurant business and still do on the side so watching this kind of behavior is astonishing to me. While this place truly has the potential to be wonderful, due to the obvious lack of interest shown by employees/managers (not sure who the manager was, if they even had one) I can only image that the owners themselves mustn't have too much care either. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Hotel staff recommendation.  Seated immediately for a late supper.  Order taken promptly and food arrived in a timely manner.  I had the Old Stone Wedge Salad with a rosemary ranch dressing, the Old Stone sirloin with herbed butter and mashed potatoes with gravy.  I really enjoyed the salad. It was unique with carrots, dried cranberries and potato sticks.  The steak was closer to medium rare than the medium requested/preferred but still seasoned quite well and overall was not a disappointment.  Yeast roll and Mashed potatoes were average.  Other members of party had a very large cheeseburger with steak fries and Shrimp with grits (unexpectedly contained jalapeño). The Chorizo sausage was pretty bland and overcooked, almost tasted like and consistency of a beef jerky.  I would definitely consider returning if in the area."}
{"text":"Sat at bar for 15 mins..... ignored. 3rd time not the charm. Don't waste your time or money. Worked out tho.... found Q Peace and hominy.... outstanding customer service and outstanding food!! Will tell all of my military friends!!!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and was looking for a good steak place to eat. The food was very tasty, and I would come back to this restaurant to eat again.  I had the ribeye steak."}
{"text":"I think the food for the price is fair. I know it sounds petty, but I don't like hidden up charges on my bill. We ordered baked potatoes and were asked if we wanted them all the way. Yes, we did. Not until we saw the bill did we find out cheese and bacon is $1.00 extra (butter and sour cream is standard).  Then our son ordered asparagus as a side. Fine, but that was $4.00 extra. We were told they now have a kale salad. Great, $3.50 extra. The wait staff should say, \"would you like bacon and cheese for $1.00 extra?\"  When it was all said and done, we had $10.50 worth of up charges that were not explained to us."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and they have a lot of great choices on the menu. I got the shrimp and grits with a field green salad. It was all very delicious. The only downside was the service, I waitress would disappear for 20 minutes at a time."}
