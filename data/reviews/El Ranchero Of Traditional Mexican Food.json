{"text":"The food is Amazing!!!! I am addicted to everything on the menu!! Great service!! The owner is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great price and great service! We went on a Friday night and it was just us and another family in the restaurant.  The flavors and feel reminded me of my favorite place in Puerto Vallarta. Authentic flavors and service. The owner/chef waited on us personally, and was very attentive. Salsa is a bit spicy but very good. Ask for some guacamole, it's not on the menu, but he'll make it fresh for you. And the green sauce is to die for! I had the marinated pork chimichanga ( also not on the menu) and my boyfriend had the carne asada. Both were wonderful. Even the rice and beans were good! We will definitely be back. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for great mexican food in Arizona for the last two years. This place hit the spot!! It was honestly some of the best we have ever had and would go back soon. My husband had the Ranchero burrito which I would highly recommend and I had steak fajitas (amazing!!!!). Miguel, the cook brought the food out personally and takes pride in the freshness, combinations of tastes and presentation of his food. He uses his own special seasoning for the fajita meet which really made it stand out above others. I HIGHLY recommend this place!! Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yes - go here!   We were very happy to find this restaurant around the corner from one of our friends' house which would mean many blissful returns to El Ranchero...  We went here with a group of friends on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant was fairly quiet at the time which suited us perfectly and also had the added benefit of the chef/owner serving us. He was really friendly, sincere and attentive to our table.   I had a carne asada quesadilla and barbecue pork soft tacos. My husband had the chicken quesadilla and carne asada soft tacos. All of the above - delicious!  The chef also brought us some of the house specialty hot sauce and guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa. These were amazing! I could not get enough of the guacamole and had to ask for extra before we left.   The food was priced very decently and the serving sizes were more than enough.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for really tasty authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Small and quiet, friendly staff and amazing food! The rice is especially delicious. The salsa has a kick and hit of lime- devine! The Chile Relleno was delicious and presented beautifully. The chicken fajitas were marinated and moist and juicy!  Check out the women's bathroom for a laugh."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here on 5-13-13 and she Had the chicken fajitas and I Had The steak fajitas. We both loves our dishes, the place is small and quite I would Recommend going here for really good food along with good prices. We will Definitely be going back"}
{"text":"The food was solid. Nice chips and salsa, not too rich of beans, and the right amount of cheese. Ordered chorizo and eggs, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tostada and an enchilada (just because we have to try an enchilada everywhere).  Chorizo and eggs - good but not great Bean and Cheese burrito - not overly filled, so it could have had more Carne asada - Excellent! Enchilada - a very good enchilada (not on the menu, so make sure to ask)   The only problem was the service. There were only 2 people working, and the woman didn't speak english well enough so the chef had to come out and take orders. So he was obviously very busy and missed the side of rice we ordered. No fault to his own, he was doing everything, but it was something to note. We were thinking that maybe she fits more with the spanish speaking neighborhood, but for us it made it a little difficult to order."}
{"text":"Great Ranchero meal. I lived in Mexico for 9 years and this food is the closest thing to BCS I've had in the states. Miguel, the owner is a super friendly guy and eager to please.   They will have liquor starting around Feb 8th 2012 or so.   Don't pass them by, stop in for a good meal or order to go and please your pallet at home."}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed at all with this place.  Besides the out-of-the-way location, the atmosphere inside felt a little drab.  It didn't help there were no tables in the center of the dining room, and some strange fake trees like rainforest cafe inside.   The Spanish language channel blasting at full volume with a waitress who doesn't speak English didn't help either.   The place just seemed off.  There were a few things not on the menu.  Why?  Get on the computer and print them out!    One of my pet peeves is paying for water.  So when I asked for some ice water and got a small bottle of arrowhead, we were already off to a bad start.  I love spicy salsa and one way I can handle it is by drinking LOTS of water.  At $1.50 a bottle, I didn't want to blow $5 on water before the meal even arrived.  Lame.   Even in Mexico I can get free filtered ice water.    Food was just okay.  Rice was fresh.  Beans were ok.  The cheese enchiladas could have been better.   There's nothing differentiating them from low-end taco shops.     Overall I think this place has room for improvement."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high praise for this  restaurant. Waitress was very nice, but the food was just okay. Nothing to rave about. Very limited menu. We were the only ones in there during prime time on a Friday night, so that should have been a clue. Sorry, but I hope this isn't the best that Scottsdale has to offer."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting AZ for the first time from the east coast.We  found this wonderful restaurant on a Thursday afternoon after a long flight. We were greeted by the owner/chef who helped us with the menu and we had the best red salsa and chips. Our family of four enjoyed the enchiladas and the chimichangas. It was a great way to begin our trip to AZ and hope some day to go back."}
{"text":"After living in Phoenix for over four years we finally found a Mexican place we love.  This is a family owned seemingly authentic Mexican hole in the wall recently under new ownership.  We were greeted by the owners son who speaks perfect English. He brought us fresh  chips and spicy salsa which were delicious.  The menu has a ton of sea food options ie shrimp octopus tilapia etc.  The menu also offers beef and chicken items, I noticed beef tongue which I would have ordered but for my dietary restrictions.  I ended up ordering the entire hot red tilapia and my wife ordered chili relleno.  Both entrees came with house salad, rice, vegetarian beans, and a warm flour tortilla.  The fish was absolutely amazing in a perfectly spiced red sauce with grilled onions.  My wife's relleno was fine but she regretted not ordering a fish item.  All that plus a beer for 24$ before tip.  We will be regulars here"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food, if that is what you're in the mood for. A lot of food for a very fair price"}
{"text":"Although it took a while for my food.....This was probably the best pollo con queso  quesodilla I have had in a long while. Very tender meat, great balanced with the food. The salsa was pretty hot, which I loved! Definitely a must try restaurant. By the way, they do serve enchiladas!  You just have to ask:)"}
{"text":"I love trying new Mexican restaurants and have been wanting to try El Ranchero for awhile now considering I live right down the street. We were very pleased by our first visit. Service was very quick and my boyfriend was happy that they fountain and bottled soda. My boyfriend loved his pork burrito and I had carne asada tacos which I thought were excellent and super juicy. The chips and salsa were very good as well. We went back for breakfast burritos a week later and would not recommend them; you can probably make better at home. If you want to try going somewhere new for dinner that's quiet, clean, quick and delicious..try El Ranchero."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place about a month ago on our way home from Papago Park and we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic and moderately priced and all of the staff members had smiles on. It was a memorable experience and we felt we needed to come back.  We came back today and to our surprise the waiter remembered us after a whole month. Nothing makes you feel more welcome than having a waitress or waiter mention they remember you. Our waiter was Miguel and he was absolutely fantastic. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"If I had one word for this experience, it would be \"strange\". What a strange place, and a strange evening... That said, the food was delightful!  I live right around the corner from this place and have run past it so many times... we finally decided to give it a shot with some friends, looking for a quick dinner before taking them to the airport. When we parked, the place looked empty, but an \"open\" sign illuminated the front window. We gave it a shot and walked in, only to be greeted by an overwhelming \"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\" of what seemed like a contact alarm system on the door. A lady looked up, understandably startled, and we inquired as to whether they were open, since the place was empty, and we seemed to have set off an alarm. (It stops as soon as the door is closed.)  She informed us that they were indeed open, and told us to sit anywhere. We stepped out onto the patio where she came out to take our drink orders. She took quite a while getting them back to us, but we could hardly blame her, as she appeared to be the only one working there. We ordered some guac, which was heavy on the cilantro, but otherwise, very tasty! We began to worry a bit about the time, as we needed to get to the airport soon and had only JUST placed our orders... but since the waitress was in the kitchen cooking our orders, there was no one to whom we could express our haste. She returned a while later with all of our meals, which were (to her credit) piping hot, overwhelmingly fresh and DELICIOUS. I will ABSOLUTELY be back here again (when I have more time)! It was probably the best burrito I've ever had, and I remember being struck by the freshness of the ingredients - there was so little grease and it didn't feel runny... just really, really delicious. A few minutes after we wolfed down our food, we paid and continued on to the airport. Our friends made their flights (however closely) and we all agreed that the place had been totally worthwhile!   This woman was fantastic - I couldn't believe she did it all herself! That said, there's no reason to have only ONE person in a restaurant. Maybe we were there at an awkward time... but at least the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent traditional mexican food with fair prices. Miguel does a great job in the kitchen using quality ingrediants. Tried the fried shrimp platter and carnitas, muy sobroso! Basic chesse and onion enchiladas are superb. You've got to try this mom & pop casita soon. You will enjly. Beer only, bring your own wine. Cheap date!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Miguel, owner and chef, is awesome.  Besides making some kick-ass Mexican fare, he is a great guy.  He will serve you the food himself, and go out of his way to make sure you are satisfied.  Guacamole is not on the menu, however, you need only ask Miguel to make some.  And Miguel makes the BEST GUACAMOLE YOU WILL EVER EAT!!!  Garlic shrimp were great, and the beans that accompany the main courses are amazing (and i don't like beans!).  Fajitas full of flavor.  Endless chips and salsa to start.  I could go on and on.  We were in Scottsdale for 8 nights, and ate at some great places (Deseo, Roaring Fork, Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, Hiro Sushi, Rehab Burger Therapy, White Chocolate Grill).  If I could only return to one of them again in my lifetime, it would be El Ranchero."}
{"text":"God I'm a cheap date.  My choice for dinner.  I had eaten at another restaurant in the same location quite a few years ago.  The decor was pretty horrendous, but the food was okay.    We arrived on a Friday night to an empty parking lot, but wait, there was one truck on the side.  Arguing over whether it was actually open (where would all the employees be parked?), I marched my lazy ass to the door, and yep, they were open.  My first thought was, \"I actually didn't think this place could go downhill in appearances, I was wrong.\"  From the outdoor wire tables serving as pub tables in the bar, to the same giant fake tree that has stood there as long as the Redwoods, to tile that must have been installed the year tile was invented, to the tables all with chairs up indicating they weren't really expecting customers (and we were it as a matter of fact), two things were clear.  I was either going to get a food-borne illness or a pretty good meal.  I got the latter.  Although there were quite a few seafood dinners, we went the safe route and both got burritos...his a carne asada, mine carnitas.  His without enchilada sauce was toasted.  Mine enchilada style with a pretty good sauce.  Not much I can say.  Burritos were good.  They had Mexican Coke in a bottle.  I left happy.    Would I go again?  Maybe.  I like a good hole-in-the-wall, but this was like the hole in the hole-in-the wall.  It also felt a little strange with no other customers.  I even saw the cook peek into the restaurant, perhaps wondering who had actually come in.  The only other people there were a a few sitting at the bar, obviously friends or relatives."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant at a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area. The food was very good! The cooks aren't afraid to be sure there is some kick either! We ordered three different items to all sample them- beef/steak enchilada, pork tacos, and a chicken Mexican 'pizza'. Each was so yummy! VERY large glasses of soda. As we went at an extremely early dinner hour, we received a lot of attention from the staff, who were very friendly and hospitable. A good experience and meal overall!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness I live right by El Ranchero!!! I am delighted and overwelmed by the quality of food, timeliness of every order placed and great prices.  This is authentic as it gets and the staff is ready to assist your request."}
{"text":"It's tough to measure Mexican food. But being it my first time in the west coast, all my friends emphasized that I must try the Mexican food. I was in Phoenix and we drove around for a Mexican restaurant that didn't have all the Yelp banter associated with it.   So we found El Ranchero, which was previously \"The Original...\". We gave it a try. We ordered Carne Asada, chicken tacos and had some sweet rice milk drink that was out of this world. With the rice, beans, cheese, salad, the hot sauces and the flour tortillas, and for the $9 that I paid, I couldn't have picked a better authentic spot.   P.S. Their jalapenos were OD spicy. Save your tongue for the food."}
{"text":"So sad that El Ranchero closed! We tried the new owners. The service was very slow and there was only one other customer. The menu looked interesting but my dish was painfully spicy - I even had to step outside to cool off. I love very spicy dishes but I will never go back. A super bummer."}
{"text":"so far, this is the most deceptive yelp rating we have found. this is NOT a 4.5 star mexican restaurant., and it really isn't even a 3 star eatery. our start here was good, with tasty chips and salsa and a kind waitress whose english was very shaky (all of which we took as a promising sign).  we had high hopes as we waited far too long for our food, but the warning signs were already there; the worst margaritas ever, not even one other party arriving for dinner, and a drab dining room that looked much better in the photos. when the food finally did come, it was just disappointing.  and while the salsa that came with the chips was good, both the red sauce, and green sauce that was brought to the table with the food were both lousy. the beans were salty, the rice was weird, and i believe the taco shells were from a box. not one in our party of 5 were the slightest bit impressed with the food quality. not sure why it's so difficult to find decent mexican food in this town, but it is! steer far away from el ranchero, it's one of the poorest i have ever been to. cannot believe that some people ranked it so highly! the only one in the east valley has received rave reviews from us so far, has been \"susies mexican cafe\" in east tempe. take the drive!"}
{"text":"I've been to El Ranchero a couple times now and have had great food every time. My business is right around the corner so it's real easy for me to pop in for lunch. Miguel and Cortez are both great there."}
