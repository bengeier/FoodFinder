{"text":"Really appreciate a business that invests and sustains local history, and Hole in the Rock does this nicely - take a bit of time to wander around and check out the courtyard as well.  Homemade chips were awesome along with the onion dip - worth a visit, especially for those seeking a midcentury architectural venture."}
{"text":"We went to Hole in the Rock on a Friday night recently, and were surprised to find no other customers.  The decor is well thought out and beautiful, very aesthetically pleasing.  The waitress was really nice and efficient.  The menu is pretty limited, which was great for me, as I find extensive menus overwhelming.  I got a B.L.T. with avocado and fries, my boyfriend got a grilled cheese sandwich and the house-made chips.  Everything we had was crazy good, the fries and chips were so amazing, and I'm pretty picky about fries.  Our sandwiches were delicious as well.   After dinner, we went to the lounge for a drink, and loved it in there, too.  The bartender was really personable, fun to talk to.   I think that overall, I dig this place because of how beautifully done the decor is, and how delicious everything we had was.  I want to go back soon for happy hour. I hope that more people visit Hole in the Rock and have great experiences like we did.  I'd love to see this place thrive."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant! nice retro decor,  I was very impressed with our server she so nice and friendly, the food is great! I had the chicken parm and it was delicious, the s'more desert is to die for! the pound cake is also amazing! If you visit you have to try their Blood Orange Dreamsicle, or the I'm Your Huckleberry drinks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from out of town and stumbled across this fantastic retro-style dinner. We were pretty disappoint when our other dinning option fell through, but we saw this place on Yelp and seemed reasonable, well priced, and not too far from the other location.  I'm sooooo glad glad we found this place. One of the best meals I've had barring a very select few that are quiet a bit more pricey. The atmosphere was fantastic with retro done in a very classic sort of way that wasn't over done or funky.  The food on the other hand was top notch. I had The Petit Tender, my wife had The Petit Tender Salad, and the Onion Dip.  The Onion Dip was brimming with tasty ever so lightly caramelized onion and topped with green onion rings. *amazing* The potato chips were lightly fried and not greasy at all. They were also perfectly seasoned and were difficult to put down.  A must try if you like onion.  The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare for both of us. Mine came with tender seasonal veggies (actually fresh seasonal) and shoestring potatoes. The steak had a sweet not to spicy habanero BBQ sauce.  My wife's salad was fresh and came drizzled with balsamic and looked amazing.  Only bad part was we couldn't order dessert because we were so stuffed and happy. :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. As a mid century modern enthusiast I was impressed by the decor and the attention to detail. This was a really well executed remodel. However, the menu does not match that vibe at all. It is the opposite of hip. Please look to The Vig and Zuzu for inspiration as how to incorporate a swank vibe with an eclectic menu."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the bar and dinner have a nicely executed mid century feel which I love. I appreciate the complimentary breakfast but wish they were busier. The wait staff is very friendly and warm. The food was very good... If you live or work in the area I recommend seeing Renee the bartender for happy hour... She's great!"}
{"text":"The Hole in the Rock Restaurant really is a hole in the wall.   We've been here a couple times for brunch and it's emptier than the Pakistani restaurant on Seinfeld.   Decor can be described as mid-century, Mad Men (I never watched it so I can't agree or disagree).       The food is a great value for the cost.    Staff is friendly, free wi-fi and they have yelp check in discounts.     The Hole in the Rock is part of the Magnuson Hotel Papago inn"}
{"text":"We came here for work.  At first I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality of the hotel, but the customer service is excellent.   I will continue to go here even beyond our current visit.   It truly is a people business, and the main reason for the turnaround in experience is Mike S, their bartender.  Honestly the best bartender that has served us in ages.  Not the type to just stand at the bar and ignore his patrons, he truly brings conversation to the forefront and his friendly attitude invites all parties to join in.  Such a wonderful experience, you have to come check out this place, if even for the nightlife that is The Hole in the Rock."}

{"text":"Had a late breakfast here after checking out and it was nice and relaxing. We were able to eat outside in the shade since it's not too hot in October. Straightforward menu that was carried out well!  I would like to try hanging out in the lounge sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Not great, but not gross. We went here for a late breakfast and were disappointed. The pancakes were really dry and had a funky flavor, but the berry compote was all right. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the most bizarre experience at this place and by bizarre I mean horrible! We  walked in apparently after a \"rush\" on a sunday morning and the waitress was so flustered. I have never seen a waitress so flustered. I was beginning to feel my heart beating faster in the presence of her stress. We were not staying at the hotel but we ended up grabbing coffee and water from the continental breakfast stand because we had already been waiting too long for coffee and water. The food was pretty good and I appreciated the atmosphere and decor so I added a star.When it was time to leave we asked her to split our check down the middle and handed her 2 cards. She, again was flustered and then 5-10 min comes back out and says that she does not know how to split the check and will have to wait for her manager. Please keep in mind she was trying her best to keep a smile and was not rude in any way. We finally got frustrated and told her just to put it on one card. She seemed relieved. I dont know. I  was just hoping for a relaxed diner style restaurant. I dont think I will try this place again."}
