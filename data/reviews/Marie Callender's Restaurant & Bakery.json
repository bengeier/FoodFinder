{"text":"I don't think you can find a better pie than Marie Callender's coconut cream! I have picked them up quite often from this location and the staff is always friendly and the pie is always delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"so its a hot day in  Las Vegas.  decided to stop by marie callenders for desert by purchasing a pie with coffee. to our surprise the waitress said that its their policy not to serve WHOLE PIES AT THE TABLE IN THEIR RESTAURANT. so my wife and I agreed to just have coffee since we sat down and ordered the pie to go.       I know they have the right to deny service. but what if i wanted to eat 10 pies in their establishment? we did not ask for special order. their pies are sitting in the show case and all we did is ask for a whole one to eat at the table with my six year old and one and a half year old with me and my wife. I mean if we were to order 4 slices thats the same as a whole pie, I ended up just cancelling the order and drank our coffee and left . now we know why the second location went out of business on flamingo and decatur. the restaurant was empty at 4pm in the hot after noon and its like there was no line of patrons waiting to be seated or ordering anything to take home. I guess the pies look a lot better just sitting in the show case rather than be sold. I dont understand the logic but its their business maybe I needed to slow down on sweats anyway"}
{"text":"Was a little apprehensive walking in. Smelled kinda like an old run down diner. Lady who sat us was not very friendly. So naturally thought bad things to follow. Service from our waiteess was outstanding!!! Food was delicious and fresh. Must try the Shrimp and Avocado stack, was ahhhhhmazing!!"}
{"text":"I walked in and noticed a cashier counting money from the cash register. I asked her for a pie. Without washing her hands from counting dirty dollars and coins, she picks up a pie from a bakers rack full of other pies and places my pie in a pie box. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I wanted pie. I like the pies at Marie Calendars. This is the only reason I chose to eat lunch here.  I ordered two veggie items from their \"light\" menu. The image of the pasta shell and veggies made it look like it was 2/3rd veggies and 1/3rd pasta. The item that arrived was 4/5th pasta and 1/5 veggie, and very oil-heavy. Those few veggies present looked like \"dwarf-veggies\" -- imagine carrots but much smaller. Same with other veggies. There was a thin pool of oil and over half of the pasta remained in this dish before I stopped eating it. I'd bet local, repeat customers prefer pasta.  I also ordered a salad, but the lettuce was the most wilted I've had in a salad in Las Vegas in this last trip. Veggies also suffered from looking less than crisp, and limp.  The only saving grace was the pie. It was delicious.  If I am to return here, it will only be for pie and tea -- I'll eat the meal somewhere else.  Food prepared at other Marie Calendars (outside Las vegas) does not suffer like this. it is possible all Las Vegas Marie Calendars have similar quality, but I didn't visit them.  If not for the pie, this place would get 1 star."}
{"text":"My parents love it here but our last experience here was somewhat unpleasant.  We had dinner here for my dad's birthday and the whole family was present. My 8 yr old nephew is allergic to a lot of things, so naturally my brother was cautious. As usual, he would have a little talk with the restaurant manager and ask about the ingredients for the kids meals. Other restaurant hosts would make sure that my nephew would get enough to eat, without serving him any food that he might be allergic to.  But not here. I'm not sure at the moment if the lady who was talking to us was the manager or the head chef. She was dressed in a sloppy hoody and talked with an attitude.  \"So what are you crying about?\" Is the first thing she said. WOW. That is not the way you treat customers. Especially loyal ones. My dad is a little deaf so he didn't hear that. I looked at her in disbelief but I let my brother do all the talking.  I felt like my brother was pissed but he still carried on in a calm manner because his son was there. He simply asked her questions about the ingredients of her food and she sounded so condescending about everything and from what I remember, one of the last things she said is, \"do you want me to read off all the ingredients on allllll the boxessss? Because that would take some time.\" My brother forced a smile and just said, \"you know what? Just forget it. Thank you for your time.\" She walked away still looking pissed, I don't know why.   My poor nephew ended up not eating anything because he's scared. He knows soy, tomatoes, wheat, and other things could practically kill him. I feel bad that he couldn't be helped. :(  Food was so-so. I got a headache from so much grease."}
{"text":"This review is for pies only don't waist your money eating in the restaurant. With that said I have had every pie they sell and have no negative comments. It quick and easy and the staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"YUMO!  The food is always good just wish they had a salad bar at this location.  Service is great and consistent."}
{"text":"These are the best pies in Vegas.  I had the strawberry, blueberry, lemon cream, and apple.  They were all outstanding.  Will go again and again to get these delicious pies."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for the over-75 crowd:  loads of 'fried and battered this and thats' and only one vegetarian offering: Portions small and over-priced, most lunch entrees more than $12.  The server asked if  we 'would like corn bread brought to our table'...sure we said, or we'd surely starve.  He came back wit a 2.5\"x2.5\" cube of corn bread for all three of us to share (I measured it).  My mom likes it when i bring here for lunch...I eat before we go. The restroom was clean.  The pie is very good.  Upscale Denny's."}
{"text":"Good place for some home-cooked style food. I found both the food and service to be up to my standards. I definitely recommend the pot pie, even my friend who generally hates pot pie ended up liking it.   Only gripe is how I had to flounder with a fairly hot dish to get it into a takeout box, was kind of hoping the servers would do that instead of just leaving me with an empty box."}
{"text":"Over priced less than average food, wait staff was nice and the corn bread they serve before the meal is the best part of it. And the pie was good but really no better than what you get at the store and bake yourself. My boyfriend got country fried steak and I got a french dip both were mediocre. We both had cokes and split a slice of pie. Our total was $43 and so totally not worth it. We only went in the first place because we had a gift card. Do yourself a favor and just go to the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to Maria calendars for many many years .. I decided to give it another try and I had the salmon with veggies lemon crusted it was absolutely delicious fresh and to my surprise the salmon had a great season and to it. For dessert I had the apple pie and it was amazing one of the best apple pies I've ever had very fresh very moist"}
{"text":"Do not come here. Ordered a burger medium, comes well done. I send it back, and i'm waiting and waiting and waiting. My hubby is well done with his food by this time and I'm still waiting. Finally get my burger and the fries are cold. Really? you can't give me fresh fries? Had to send it back again. my hubby wanted pecan pie but they were all out. Seriously, you guys are known for your pies and everytime we come you guys are out of our favorite and we always have to settle. This will be the last time we come here. Manger seemed all over the place and not doing a good job of keeping service smooth. I know we weren't the only upset table."}
{"text":"A family tradition...Wow what a shock...Went in for Pie's the special of buy 1 pie and get the 2nd for $4.99...great deal...EXPIRED...Muffins  buy 4 and get 4 free  great deal...EXPIRED..But It's Marie's so its all worth it...Went home with my 8 muffins and 1 apple pie only to find that the pie crust was burnt not edible  the bottom of the pie was also burnt to the famous tin pan and the muffins had to be at least 2 weeks old. Very dry and burnt..What happened to the quality of the food. Please don't let this be another family favorite go up in smoke....I would have never thought of checking the pie before I left, never had too....LET'S DO SOME QUALITY CONTROL ..Make Marie Proud......"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service!  Food was good-----not out of this world---but above average.  Our server was the cutest!  Very upbeat and made our experience exceptional!  Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"My wife was home sick so we decided to call in an order so I could pick up on my way home. I ordered the chicken pot pie with side Ceasar salad. My wife ordered the quiche with a Side of the chicken Waldorf salad. The quiche and pot Pie were good as expected. My Ceasar salad was Accompanied by a long black hair. After my discovery, my wife had the pleasure of pulling an equally long black hair from her Waldorf salad. This may be ok, but neither of us have black hair! When I called back to the restaurant to notify them of our discovery, I was told \"ok I will let her know\". I was not given an apology, acknowledgment or an offer for anything to make It right.  We had to throw our meals out after our discovery which was a total waste of time and money. A little effort goes a long way. With service like this, I will not return."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here, said they have very good (desert) pies.  I found their shepherd's pie is amazing though, it is tasty, tasty, tasty! I tried a couple of their pies, the tip is, that not every pie needs to get heated up.  The blueberry pie is one of them, for me. The staff is extremely friendly, and they remember my name when I went there the second time!   Customers here are stylish, cowboys and classy ladies, usually within my daddy's age group, but man, I hope they are my daddy's friends, so I get to see them often, hahah."}
{"text":"I usually just just pop in and buy their fresh strawberry or fresh peach pies when they are season. This time I decided to give their food a try.   Their fresh fruit pies have never disappointed but their service is another story and the restaurant was half dead. I guess the waitresses/waiters don't help each out there?   Their corn bread was warm and tasty but everything else eh its edible."}
{"text":"The customer service was great. I came in to get some pie and I was greeted immediately. When the lovely lady went to bag my pies 2 different employees also greeted me and made sure I had already been helped. That alone was awesome! The coconut cream pie was delicious and so was the original cheesecake! I look forward to tasting their food in the future."}
{"text":"If I could put Half a star I would. Went there tonight to pick up dinner to bring home, along with 2 pies, and I don't know what happened to this place, but nothing, and I mean nothing had any taste!  Their chicken pot pies, which used to be so good, now not only have no taste, but look like baby food! It was disgusting. And their corn bread, that used to be the best, was dry and grainy..... Their pies have even gone down hill, as well. Ordered a banana cream and a German chocolate cream, and they were nothing but gelatinous messes.  Will never go back there! Awful  However, I do have to say, the manager, the young lady, and the young gentleman who was seating people, could not have been any nicer...super accommodating!  Now, if they could only get a decent cook and kitchen staff....."}
{"text":"Initially, I was peeved because I had arrived with a birthday coupon and the \"boy\" working there had informed me that I had to purchase an extra entree and that it was for dine-in only. Right away, they are telling me that \"you can't get want you want, especially for your birthday.\" So, I was there, I might as well just eat.  Low and behold, a hidden treasure if I ever did find one. My server had replied \"yes\" to everything I asked for. From what I had seen, she was the only one waiting on tables and she had time to stop and check on me several times, and not just -can I put you on hold,click- she stayed, waited, and dignified my request with a reply. I used to rely on Hooter's-Mission Valley for great service, but that was 10 years ago, and all the Hooter's locations in Las Vegas are just another Denny's to me- impersonal, no smile, one or two water refill checks.  Heather was her name. The type of service she had exhibited is reminiscent of Sunday morning Cracker Barrel from a middle aged lady circa 1984. This service is non-existent today, in fact most of 90's and all of the 2000's is nothing short of piss poor, with Heather at the Henderson location on Stephanie being the exception. I am now going to schedule 90% of my dining-out meals here. I mean the food was okay, but there isn't one place out there that can impress me with their culinary findings. Thanks, Heather, for giving me a experience that made me cry."}
{"text":"Old men everywhere  Salty pot roast makes me sad  Pie is redemption."}
{"text":"No Sunday brunch at this location. What? That's what Marie Calendar's is all about. I was craving their Sunday brunch and that's the whole reason we went in. The food we had was ok. Not bad not great. But I was too disappointed missing out on brunch to enjoy it much. All locations should offer brunch."}
{"text":"Took  my young son for a late lunch. He had mac and cheese W/ garlic toast and I had fish and chips. My son refused to eat his meal ( the kid has a great appetite) said he did not like the taste. I tried it and  I agreed and his garlic toast was not good either. My fish and chips were the worst I have ever had. The coating was overdone and oily, the fish was not flaky and moist but old and had the consistency of having been frozen more then once. The fries tasted off (time change the oil in the fryers) and the seasoning was odd, and they were overdone as well. The cooks don't care, the waiters serve this overpriced and overcooked slop. I smell another closed restaurant, the sooner the better.If you want to eat here, stick to the pies. This is a never go back to restaurant, too many other family style restaurant in the neighborhood to choose from! Save your money, time, and stomach and bypass this place."}
{"text":"I had my sister in from out of town last night. We had enjoyed a day full of activity and were looking forward to a glass of wine and some hearlt felt cooking. We ordered our waters, got carded (I am 23, my sister is 25) and our wine never came. The waiter (Ken was very nice) asked to bring my sister's id to the back office. Something felt off about that. A few uncomfortable moments later, Jean the manager came to our table stating she would not serve us alcohol with a fake id. Arizona id's expire 50 years later. Jean should have known that. It was inconvenient and embarrassing to be treated this way. The food may be delicious,  but after being treated this way, I never want to find out."}
{"text":"Everyone knows the chain. Giant portioned heaping helpings of comfort food, which I am pretty sure is a euphemism for food that makes you fat.   This particular location gets an unfair amount of my attention being located next to my girlfriend's home, she loves their potato cheese soup.   The food is fine, but good lord, the staff is suffering from multiple brain injuries. Its the only explanation. In the dozen or so times I've had to eat there in the last 2 years, they've never gotten an order correct the first time, no matter how simple it is.   I am giving them the benefit of the doubt attributing their failure to stupidity rather then malice. Every time they have \"forgotten\" much of the order. These people are too young to have senile dementia, and get outpreformed by kids working fast food restaurants with more complicated orders.   I can get a 15 dollar salad anywhere, except here, where they forget to include the salad. There really isn't any excuse for for extrordinarily slow, absolutely innaccurate service with mediocre fattening food."}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch today. We were seated right away as they were not busy at the time we arrived. Our server came over and took our drink order, brought us our drinks and then disappeared for several minutes, without bringing the cream for coffee. When he finally reappeared, we had to again ask for cream. We finally ordered our food and it came out fairly quickly. The food tasted ok. Our problem wasn't with the food, it was the service. All fairness to our server, it seems as if they were understaffed. He never refilled drinks, didn't check on us until after we had finished eating. Left dirty dishes on the table, no one ever came to clear our table. I would think a manager should of stepped up and did drink refills, table bussing, customer service, etc., if they were short on help."}
{"text":"At first I thought they forgot about my son and I when we were seated, but that was short lived. Today was my birthday and it turned into one of my worse days of my life...you see I started today with a blown tire and it never got better. Once the Manager and her staff heard about my folly of misfortunes they took extra special care of my son and I. They even brought out my piece of pie with a lit candle. I was blown away when they picked up the cost of my meal. They almost brought me to tears...that's how down and grateful I was. They helped turn my day around. It's amazing how a little kindness can do wonders.  I wish more restaurants would follow their lead. Thank you again...best birthday dinner ever. BTW....I don't consider myself a regular, but I do come here often enough. The Pot Pie combo is not only fantastic, but a great value. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Out of town guests having great memories of how delightful Marie Callendars of the 1980s used to be and a hunger for  Banana Cream Pie found us arriving hungry!   Just so you know...It's not toilet sewage one smells in the parking lot. It's a poorly  maintained grease trap which employees happily attest to being the culprit! REALLY!???? I wondered how many folks never proceed!   Please.... Someone fix it!  And yet voicing the plea falls on deaf ears I'm sure!  It's a travesty reading reviews from customers who are so looking to experiencing great pot pies similar to or exceedingly better than the frozen ones!  The age of Marie Callendars  seems to have come and gone. Such a pity! It was once synonymous with Great Pies!  The cases as you enter promise a great selection of pies and more!    The decor of M. C. Apparently has been transformed from welcoming and fun to coffee shop tacky with 1980's tacky framed prints on the walls!     The food is better at Stations Casino Cafe or nearby MiMis. Shrimp tacos were ...nothing special. Pulled pork sandwiches average akin to what one would expect wrapped in foil at a high school sports event from the concession stand... C'mon you know the type. Salmon dinner was edible, decently flavored but a surprisingly small portion for a full priced dinner which did not come with pie as the pork sandwiches did!  The annual pie sale 7.99 in February will probably find me there again!   It's sooo sad that M.C. Is hellbent on slumming it when there is still a market for great food and pie!!!  The bright spot is as always their pies... If the stench in the parking lot doesn't turn your stomach first!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to meet family and just chit chat over breakfast. The service is always good and the best part is the buy one get one free breakfast coupon. I highly recommend this place if you like to visit with your guest or spouse. It's quiet and clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in to commit a pie robbery (Hands up! Give us all your pies!) but instead decided to have lunch.  The staff was nice, but the service was a little slow.  Being from the East, we don't have Marie Callender's so it seemed like a nice place to stop in.  This perhaps creates a bit of a bias, so take that into account.  Still, the food was good and even with the slow service we had no complains with the food. Next time we are going to commit some 'Pie-way Robbery'!"}
{"text":"Ordered my 2 pies ahead online and when I arrived they both just done being made. Service was great and the young lady was very courteous. Hopefully I don't have to make another trip since pies are on sale this month.  Oh I got pecan pie and lemon cream cheese. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"On Friday night we were on our way to pick up our daughter from the babysitter and decided to stop and have dessert at 8175 West Sahara Avenue.   The last time I was in this store was December of 2011, and I had such a bad experience I have not wanted to go back.   When we walked in I saw that they were clearing the pies off the shelf and the waitress seemed surprised that we walked in the restaurant.  I said \"Oh are you closed?\" She said \"No, we close at 10pm.\"  I then looked at my phone and saw that it was 9:52.  I told her that we just wanted a bite of pie and she turned to her manager to ask if it was ok.  Seriously!!!! If you close at 10pm then you should still help customers until you close!! The manager said \"Well...I guess...\".  Our last experience at this location also involved a bad manager and I see that the staff and management have not improved.  At that point I walked out and said I would not come back to this Marie Calendars. Two bad experiences (the one last year was so bad that we were almost late to my daughters recital even after we told the manager we needed to leave) I can't recommend that anyone goes to this location."}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas we decided to go off strip to avoid the crowds for a late Sunday breakfast to all places Marie Callender's. Upon entering the restaurant is clean and welcoming. We were greeted and seated immediately to a booth. We ordered the 2 breakfast smashers and the pie trio. All was delicious! Even better was our waiter. Jesus was attentive, friendly, and spoke Spanish which helped my mom communicate her order since she only speaks Spanish. This was a great Sunday brunch experience."}
{"text":"Usually a good standby choice with meals a cut above some of the other national chains, while their menu doesn't have the selections of some of the others they do have a good variety. Haven't had a bad meal but sometimes the service can be hit or miss but that can happen at any restaurant. Their Hashers are good sized portions and the French Toast combo is a good value, in my opinion their one weak link is their pancakes, if that is what you have a taste for then perhaps one of chains with pancakes in their might be a better fit. Pies are good but a bit pricey unless they have a special and the muffins and very good when they are fresh, if your in the area and undecided it is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Weak. Tastes even worse than their frozen meals at grocery stores. Go to mcdonalds instead."}
{"text":"It was my mother's first trip to Las Vegas and I suggested we have breakfast at this Marie Callender's Restaurant since I've enjoyed eating at other Marie Callender's locations.  What a mistake!  We went there at 9:00 a.m. this past Tuesday.   First, we were greeted by an unsmiling hostess and seated in a booth with an unsecured seat bottom.  What I mean is that the booths have bench seats, but mine kept sliding forward whenever I moved.  Anyway, we waited about 5 minutes before the rather large (not exaggerating), solitary, unhappy waitress - absolutely no personality - took our order.  The restaurant only had 6 other patrons - it's not like it was full!  Anyway, we ordered our meals and she brought back our coffees along with one of Marie Callender's \"famous\" breakfast loaf - but it was only half cooked - the bottom of it was still gooey!!!   We waited 20 minutes more before she brought my over cooked omelet and burned hash browns - how do you ruin a simple breakfast?  To be completely honest, the two pancakes that came with my meal were okay.  However, the overall experience was such a disappointment, that I will never go back to this particular location again."}
{"text":"I can not understand how a business can offer pie of the month and be out every timeI went for one this month!!!! Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their trio of sides for Thanksgiving this year- did their complete feast last year with positive results, and with less of us celebrating I wanted to take a short cut again.   Pickup was a bit of a mess, and ultimately I received my order, but no one really checked or confirmed it- I gave my name, a list was checked, I wasn't on it, but I was given my sides. Offered my ID to check, brought the card I purchased with, but both were waved away without checking. I appreciate that it wasn't a hassle but feel there should have been a lot more organization.  Potatoes, stuffing, and gravy or 6-8 people was $25- not bad at all. Preorder with minimum 48 hours notice, up to a couple of weeks in advance.  Lunch special of pot pie, salad, and a slice is a good deal at $10- choices for chicken pot pie, tuscan shrimp, or the beef, plus a slice of one of their standard dessert pies, and you can upgrade to a featured/seasonal pie for a fee."}
{"text":"I was in the area for something else and decided to come here for breakfast since I've never eaten here before. I walked in and there wasn't anyone at the front. It took a couple of minutes for anyone to take me to a table. My waitress, however, was very friendly and helpful. I ordered a Veggie Hasher with pancakes instead of toast as my side.  It didn't take long for my order to arrive and the food was okay. There was some flavor to the dish, but I've had better. The pancakes were yummy, but they weren't spectacular and I couldn't finish all of them so I took them home. It was nice that the portion was large enough that I couldn't finish everything.  Honestly, the best part about my experience here was my waitress Laura. She's great in making sure I always had water in my glass and that I had everything I needed. She's a real sweetie."}
{"text":"Have been coming to mc's forever. Usually for pie. Food, aside from the potato cheese soup and cornbread are kinda bleh. This location is and has been pretty horribly managed for a long time now. Have been waiting for 20 minutes now for my pie and am watching the young kids working the front totally screw up most the transactions. One girl just shorted someone their change and another kid forgot to fully charge another. Forgetting to seat people, forgetting items on pick up orders etc. If I ever feel the need for pie again I will just go to another location."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a couple of classmates for lunch. I've always had the frozen dinners and loved them, so I was pretty excited to go to the actual restaurant. The inside was clean and the staff were lovely.  After looking through the whole menu, I finally decided to go with the traditional pot pie. It was delicious! All the food I tasted was delicious and I would return for a savory dinner. Only thing is, the prices were higher than I expected. I would say that would be my only caution. Otherwise, it's quite satisfying."}
{"text":"I cant believe no one has mentioned the salad bar.  There is a glass partition for sanitation reasons but if you want something that is in the backrow like cheese for example, you have to either ask someone to get it for you or if no one is around press your face as hard as you can against the glass and reach or duck your head under the glass and crawl on top of the fixings and grab some cheese.    You also drop dressing in other flavors and on other things because they have it so far back that you are clumsily grabbing the ladle to get the dressing to your plate.  Its an impossible salad bar!  Otherwise the service and food was fantastic and we will go back but they need to change that salad bar.   Seriously!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  It wasn't very busy and were seated right away.  Our waitress was really great.  She was so attentive and friendly.    With breakfast they brought out blueberry banana bread for the table.  Delicious.  So warm and fresh! I went with the Denver hash which consisted of onions, peppers and cheese mixed into an egg scramble then placed over hash browns.  It was just ok.  It was a smaller serving that really didn't appease my appetite.    As far as chain restaurants, M.C. is ok.  I was just hoping for more.  I will say their pies in the entrance dessert case looked fantastic.  Maybe I will have to come back for dessert since they are known for their pies.    Yelp Challenge 2014 (200/365)"}
{"text":"Second time for breakfast and service, quality, freshness,  quantity were great.  No complaints and the prices are fair.  Would recommend to anyone seeking traditional breakfast that is well made."}
{"text":"Great service, although we did feel a bit rushed.  I had only been to Marie Callender's once before. It was a different location and a terrible experience. Thought we'd try it again.  The Shrimp Tacos were FANTASTIC!!!! Will definitively go again soon :)"}
{"text":"Great Pies all around!! Not to mention the best Chicken Pot Pies ever!!! Mmmm.... You just feel healthy and hearty after one of Marie's famous Pot Pies!! On the other hand. I don't get Birthday Cakes!! I always request Pies from Marie Calenders..."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place, including the little salad bar and of course the pie...but it is not as good as it once was.  The service is always so slow, you wait forever for the server to take your order, then wait forever for your drinks then wait forever for your food.  And this is while there are hardly any customers in the place.  We drive down Stephanie everyday, and there are just too many good places to eat on that street to waste your time here.  And Chic-fil-a and Raising Canes are opening right down the road."}
{"text":"Honestly? It's hit or miss here, just depends who you get to serve you. The older ladies and absolutely wonderful. Quick with drinks including refills and orders. Whereas the younger wait staff is slow and kinda grumpy like they don't want to be there. The last time one of them complained to my friend and I the entire meal like we cared. I mean no offense but we are trying to eat and listening to how much you hate your job isn't something I really want. Overall though, I continue to go back because their breakfast is YUMMY! :)"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time my husband and I got takeout from Marie Callender's. The food is delicious, the employees are friendly and cordial. It's also very clean. They are fairly quick in getting your food ready. The meals are very fresh and tasty and the pies and cheesecakes are excellent. We actually brought a New York style cheeses cake to bring home each time. The cheeses cake is a little pricey but well worth it. I highly recommend the West Sahara location."}
{"text":"After contacting corporate I spoke with Ron, who was extremely helpful and very sorry about the experience I had. He actually spoke with the restaurant, making sure I wouldn't have the same problem again. They do listen! He also sent a gift card since I had a bad experience. Went above and beyond and I really appreciate it. Now I can happily get my delicious potato cheese soup once again at Marie Callender's, and with no hassle."}
{"text":"When we first starting coming here last year their lies were delicious. Now, every time we get their banana cream the bananas are black by the time we come home and cut open the pie. Will never order this pie from their again"}
{"text":"On a cold evening we wanted soup and have not been here for a very long time. Now I know why... The place was so dirty I wanted to leave but my husband said lets just stay and give it a try. We ordered soup and cornbread. In the meantime my husband used the restroom and when he came back said that he hoped that the kitchen was cleaner than the bathrooms. The food was just okay noting like I remember from years past. Will not be going back and would not recommend Marie Callendar's to anyone that I know."}
{"text":"Bought the blueberry cream pie here last night for take out. It had a weird metallic taste to  it esp. the cream part. Took it back the next day to exchange for something else. The lady manager was extremely rude. She looked at at me all weird with my complaint and without saying anything took the pie to the back. The other staff member boxed a replacement pie while I was waiting. She came back to ring me up for the exchanged pie, and just walked away. I waited patiently not knowing whether I needed to pay for the difference or to get a receipt for the second pie.... The staff member and the freaking manager just walked away from the counter leaving me to stand there feeling like a total idiot. She did not once apologize for the mishap (that I had to drive 20 mins back to return it) and just walked away without saying ok you're all set. I felt like this place lack the common sense of customer service!!! You're in food industry, please have the common courtesy to be kinder to customers.   This will be the death of me that I have the expectation that people have more common sense than that. An apology, a thank you have a nice day, you're all set, handing me my purchase would be nice... not just freaking walk away without acknowledging the closing of a transaction you idiot. Will not feel the need to return to this facility and deal with her. Be aware of poor customer service from this lady and staff members. Mehhh now to find another dessert place. Marie Callender please consider your management is horrible!!! She looks like she hates her life .. shows all over her face."}

{"text":"Jose was our server , he did a fantastic job! Food was on point. Service was on point. The meals are affordable and free pie with your meal on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Picked up a pie, custard for our get together tonight.   A couple hours later as we cut into it, we smelled it first and it had a weird smell to it. As we took a couple bites we noticed how it had a sour eggy taste to it. Not cool. It tasted unlike any custard I had ever had.   I decided to call and speak with the manager. His name was cody and he was very polite and asked what he should do to make it right. Would we like our money back or would we like to come pick up another pie? I opted for another pie, since i know they usually are delicious.   He was super kind. Even took us where the pies are in the back to show us all the different kinds (that they hadn't run out of) and offered my daughter a free cookie. Such great customer service. He said he was glad i didnt yell at him on the phone like most customers do. We ended up taking a blueberry pie home (cause Cody said that was his wives favorite) and it was the best marie callenders pie I've ever had. Topping the peach and apple! Serious perfection! So glad we went back to fix the problem.  I'll be coming back for a pie, even with the problem, the customer service is outstanding.  Next update, it'll be about the food"}
{"text":"Today was the first time we did not enjoy our pot pie & Caesar salad. Our waitress was fine but the salad was not crisp & the pot pie was full of large pieces of carrots & celery. Not the usual flavorful dishes. Too bad because we eat here often."}
{"text":"I used to love the Marie Callendars at Flamingo and Decatur. Pies and food always great. Service sometimes great. Sometimes marginal.  After reading the reviews of the West Sahara restaurant, I am thinking I might not subject myself to a frustrating experience. Have not been there and now probably won't."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot...friendly staff....clean....great prices...kid friendly.....and they have tuesday n saturday kids free specials...."}
{"text":"I eaten at a few Marie Callender's locations. My personal experience is like that popular boy in high school that turns out to be a dud in bed. I've had better experiences...  Service: When I took my boys several months ago we had an awful experience. The waiter was rude and acted ganagster. Total idiot! This time I went to the counter to order pies. No greeting, rude, not helpful at all, the counter person acted annoyed with me for asking questions, and before I was done with my order she was already helping the person behind me. WTF?!  Marie Callender's, you seriously need to get rid of your current staff.  Food: I'm not a fan of the food, but the pies on the other hand is always good. I like the strawberry cream pie, fresh strawberry, custard, german chocolate pie, and the list goes on.  I don't even want to go on about this place because it makes me upset thinking about the staff. Unprofessional!"}
{"text":"The food is really good each time I go and I've eaten a good variety of things there not to mention the pies that are fresh and delicious the staff is very quick to greet you and have you seated in a timely manner I always enjoy my time here and the location is pretty easy to get to right of the Main Street not tucked away in the back of a parking lot"}
{"text":"My mother loves this place.  As such, she asks me to meet her here often.  Since I love both my mother and their potato cheese soup, I go.  I imagine that at some point most everyone's ended up at a Marie Callender's.  And we all know this - the food is pretty good.  I could live off of the aforementioned potato cheese soup and cornbread alone for quite some time and be completely happy.  Their turkey croissant club is always fresh and tasty.  And their pies are pretty much unparalleled for pies you can purchase which is why going here the day before Thanksgiving or Christmas is a bad idea, lines out the wazoo.  But they are so.  ridiculously.  slow.  It should not take 2 hours to complete a meal consisting of soup and a sandwich.  If it's a leisurely afternoon I don't mind so much, but if I have things to do I get awfully antsy.  I know Marie lived to be an old lady but, man, pick up the pace already."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The food is always consistent.  We came for Easter Breakfast with my aunt and uncle.  The hostess greeted us immediately upon walking into the restaurant.  We were seated right away.  The banana blueberry bread they give you while you wait is an added plus!  I had the eggs and ham.  My meal came with the homemade pancakes that were AMAZING!  Ask for the razzleberry jam on the side rather than syrup.  My wife had the texmex hasher that also came with these awesome pancakes.  She said her meal was great.  My aunt had the cali eggs benedict and she scarfed it down.  My uncle enjoyed the waffle with chocolate chips and whipped cream.  All in all the food and service were great!  We even brought home a fresh strwberry pie for a little special something later on!"}
{"text":"What happened to Marie Callender's?????   Haven't been here in awhile.  Waitress was very pleasant and helpful.  Ordered a Chicken Cobb salad....how can you go wrong?   Very dissapointed!  Pale piece of pressed chicken on top.  Had a very light grill on it and it was rubbery.  Tasteless icky.  Hard boiled egg was weird.  Was it a real egg?  Not sure.  Blue cheese dressing was great.  Waitress brought cornbread that was so dry.  Key lime pie was very good.  They are known for their pie.  I say skip the entree and have dessert instead. Sorry, Marie.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The luscious lemon dream cake is a dream, filled with lemon and a wonderful light sponge-like cake and topped with a cream cheese topping - very interesting with the bottom pie crust - delicious!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it! Our server Anthony was super nice and helpful! We ordered the chicken and broccoli fettuccine and the fried chicken poboy sandwich. The fettuccine was probably the best I've had, and the sandwich was also super good and the portions were also super big. We also ordered the watermelon iced tea which was super refreshing! Of course, we had to get pie and so we got the banana cream pie, my favorite! Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Ridiculous!!! Phone is always busy no one can answer any questions.. other locations are clueless..   Food maybe good but can't ask any questions or speak to anyone"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night for desert with my wife. Each of us ordered a piece of cheesecake and a coffee. After sitting for 30 minutes and not getting our cheesecake we informed the cashier of the wait and said we were leaving."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday. The wait for food was about 40 minutes. Waitress forgot to place our apetizer order. My 7 year old son asked for a refill of his milk (which are small cups and refills are charged) . It took the waitress about  15 minutes. My son un prompted said \"finally\" upon the waitress showing up. The adults at the table thought it was cute the waitress gave my child a horrible look. Never got my water. Food was what you would expect no issues with what we ate just lousy service and attitude"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving eve, and the restaurant is humming efficiently. I appreciate how cordial the staff is, considering most of us in line forgot to order pies in advance."}
{"text":"This place was average to me...not excellent, but not poor either. Just a suitable place to eat if you want to feel right at home at Grandma's. If I were to compare this, it's more of an upscale Denny's to me. Service was outstanding; cleanliness was average. And yes, I did try their \"all famous\" pot pie too. Again, not a horrible place to eat...I just don't see myself going back there with all the restaurants Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Came in just for a slice of pie. Key lime pie was good, but very very tangy and sour."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! It's filthy, service sucks and they are always out of cherry pie! How can they be out of an american staple? This place just needs to close and be done with it. There are too mary worthy establishments nearby"}
{"text":"oh if you haven't had their chicken pot pie you need to go now! it's so good -- love this place and the pies well, they are yummy. we shared key lime and it was very good."}
{"text":"To begin with, we occasionally go to Marie Callender's.  The food (except for the pies which are delicious but expensive) is just okay.  Today we presented a coupon to buy one entree and get another for half price.  We also had two $5.00 gift cards that were to expire today.  Our server, who was unfriendly and indifferent, delivered the news that we could not use both the coupon AND gift cards.  Further, we were not allowed to use the gift cards on \"to go\" pies.  It has always been my understanding that gift cards are like cash but apparently this restaurant only accepts CASH for payment and ignores their own gift cards.  And to make it worse, the server delivered this information from his manager in an impolite manner.  I have the server's name but will not share it here.  My husband gave the gift cards to other customers in the restaurant so the restaurant ended up accepting the gift cards anyway.  I think the manager should have either lightened up on his hard-nosed decision or come to our table and politely explain his decision.  We will never go to this restaurant again for a sit down meal due to the unfriendly service and rigid policies."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and had the wild mushroom ravioli with rosemary chicken and loved it! The server was nice except that she was kinda clumsy spilling my bear and kinda dropping plates as she set them on the table but she did apologize so maybe she was just having a bad day.  Took home a box of the chocolate cream pie which was just amazing!"}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? Cuz I would if I could and I would add some alerts and exclamation points and maybe a skull and crossbones icon.  We went to lunch on Sat., 1/10/15. Our server was Laura...it was not very busy. I explained I was \"deathly allergic to shellfish...\" I always say \"Will you please share my allergy with the kitchen so they don't handle shrimp, lobster or crab then touch my food? Sorry to be a pain...\" I have quite a prepared script. I ordered the turkey sandwich and asked to hold the avocado. My husband ordered a cup of Navy Bean soup...she brought him potato and cheese soup instead...oh well, no biggie, he didn't say anything, he enjoyed it. My sandwich came and it had the avocado on it. For a \"normal\" person, not a big deal either but when my order is not correct at all, I fear the allergy issue might a problem. I told Laura about the avocado and asked her point blank if she shared my allergy issue with the kitchen. She looked right at me and said \"No, I didn't.\" WTF? Are you kidding me? They have shrimp all over their menu!!!!!!!! She replaced the sandwich with one made under the understanding of the allergy...Also, the fact that yeah I drink a lot of soda if my fault but 60% of the meal I sat with a glass of ice. Sorry I chug a lug my Diet Coke but c'mon lady not for you to judge. Anyway...I am scared for anyone who has an allergy and gets her as a server. Not cool Laura...not...cool. :("}
{"text":"Great food and service! The waitress who works there in the morning is very hospitable and always greets you with a smile."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice pre-birthday luncheon with a friend. We each had the same thing - Chicken Pot Pie Combo which is their petite Chicken Pot Pie with a Caesar salad and a free slice of any pie except their Cheesecakes and Seasonal Fresh Fruit Pies. I chose their Custard Pie and my friend chose Coconut Cream Pie. For all of this, the price was a reasonable $9.99!  Oh and their cornbread is delightful, especially the honey butter! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to Marie Callender's, so I figured I would give it a shot and have some lunch since I drive past it all the time. My favorites here so far are the BBQ Chicken Salad & Chili with Cornbread. I didn't get a chance to have the dessert yet (I know booooo!), but I'm pretty sure they're as good as people say they are. Maybe I'll give it try next time. Lol. Overall my experience here was good, so I can't  find room to complain. Oh! And did I mention that I recommend you try the big slice of cornbread they give you at your table with the butter!"}
{"text":"Never been here before. We stumbled upon this spot because we just finished at Cowabunga Bay and it was close. Bonus was the kids eat free special on Saturday. This place reminds me a lot of Perkins back East in Orlando.   Connie was our server and super friendly and so great with our kids. She was always on top of everything and attentive. It's the best when you get great service!!! No matter where you are, great service is everything.  The kids opted for breakfast kids meals and got pancakes and eggs/bacon combo for dinner. Kids meals are priced at a fair rate of $4.99. This also includes a free pie. Oh my goodness that is a lot of food. But since we were here for Kids Eat Free day, the kids meals were free with each adult entree purchase. SCORE!!!  I got the Southwest Shrimp Salad and although it was good, I should have asked for dressing on the side. My salad was drenched in the dressing. Still good and I could still eat it but good to know for next time. The shrimp was huge and loved the grilled flavor.   The specials are a good excuse to come check out Marie Callender's. I've always been a fan of their frozen pot pies. Amazing deal for dinner with the kids eat free special. Our bill was $27!!!"}
{"text":"I made an order week ago for today(thanksgiving ) And had to pick it up at 11  When we got there was a long line , which I don't get it why they arranged the time to pick up time ?! And after 1/4 of line got their order they said no more whole turkey , just have turkey breast , which this line just was waiting for whole turkey either us,,, so I am so disappointed ,, they really didn't care about it just said sorry but we finished all whole turkey , why they get orders weeks ago ? Why they don't count for order anyway they ruined our thanksgiving. This was our first time and last time with Marie Calendar. I give them no star if I could but as I have to score minimum I reluctantly will give them one star . Their service and quality of food was absolutely terrible. Never again with these folks. We are not happy for what they did,,,"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! The food was great. This was our first visit to a Marie Callender's since moving to Vegas. It was one of our favorite places back home! Glad we found a good one fairly near by!"}
{"text":"Dishonest employees and a customer are committing identity theft at this restaurant.  Beware credit card fraud is going on and a customer and the employees are involved. Do not pay at this restaurant with a credit card ."}
{"text":"I enjoy there corn bread honey butter and cheese soup.  They do a mean tuna melt and the blue berries and cheese pie is top notch. Sometimes it hit or miss but when its good it's good. .."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love the pies here! Although they did give us the wrong ...But they did make things right they let me have a free pie but I had to go the very next day to claim it . So that's why I give them five stars. Our favorites are the apple pie and the razzle berry pie and cherry pie oh and the chocolate muffin is good too! The place itself is pretty nice the staff is professional as well."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant that I have ever eaten. There was ICE in the salad \"the salad was frozen\" Then the chicken potpie was cold. I'm very disappointed becouse I wanted to like this place"}
{"text":"Slow it has been 40 minutes and still waiting for food. Had to beg for bread. The coffee was nasty. Praying food is good. Wow"}
{"text":"What to say about this place ? Nothing special of course. You don't expect a great  meal when you go, just traditional American cooking and fast.  We chose to get the soup and salad bar. It was not that late, around 7:00pm, but lots of ingredients were missing on the salad bar; we had to ask for them. And we finally got what we wanted.   For the soup we both choose their famous cheese and potato soup that is good but soooo thick that you have the feeling to eat mashed potatoes more than a real soup.   Some pies looked good but we were stuffed with the soup so didn't have a chance to taste  at least one of them. I usually get those pies to go when I have people coming over to my house. My favorite one is the custard one. Already had the German chocolate, key lime and cheesecake and they were good..."}
{"text":"The 25 %off check in deal was what finally got me in here, it is a good Yelp extra. Let me start by saying that they do not bring you frozen dinners on a plate like some people think. Upon arriving I checked in and showed our waitress the deal.  Jasmine ( our server ) was really friendly and fast. We ordered drinks and got free fresh cornbread   to start. We each ordered entree's and opted for the salad bar add on at $4.99. this is a better deal than the soup and salad bar alone at $11.99. The salad bar is on the small side but has fresh  produce and 2 soup offerings. I had the double shrimp pasta which was really good and piping hot, the shrimp was crispy and delicious. My partner had the pot roast which looked great and was also piping hot, neither was in a microwave tray. The setting is comfortable and quiet as we got in early and did not have a crowd. Through it all Jasmine was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. This is a good week night place for a home cooked meal without the cooking and dishes. Go try and taste for yourself. And last but not least they do have pie for sale."}
{"text":"I can only give this place 2 stars. The waiter Andre I think it was looked like he didn't even wanna speak or recommend nothing good for us to have or what our specials can come with.  Another reason he looked drugged out weird looking, but the food was alright burger didn't have no flavor so I just took it To-go :/"}
{"text":"We have been here many times and their service has really gone downhill!  The section we were seated in was very busy--yet the server was an elderly woman we have had before who was just too slow and too scattered to handle all the tables in her section.  No smile, no introduction so we didn't know her name---our dinners took forever to come out (good thing we had no movie plans later!) --and she never once came over to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything else except for asking my husband if he needed an iced tea refill.  My chicken pot pie was watered down--hardly any veggies--it was like crust outside and cream of chicken soup inside-the salad was much better.   We are usually generous tippers but we couldn't do much for this lady.  Next time we will go for breakfasts instead of dinner--and if we go back, we will make sure we are not seated in her section because we will remember her.  It will be awhile before we go back---we brought home a pie when we left --that was the highlight of the evening--otherwise a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Silverware dirty, pancakes not cooked raw batter in the center and I was supposed to get 6 bacon only got 4."}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad. I had the mahi mahi tacos. It was fresh and had some flavor. It was a bit spicy. I also had a salad and strawberry pie (strawberry pie is my favorite!) Food was ok, not great. Our server was awesome though!"}
{"text":"We were were at Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath and got kinda hungry.  We finally decided to try out Marie Callender's.  I usually have my freezer stocked with several of the Herb Roasted Chicken and a few pot pies.  Right when we stepped out of the car, it STANK.  Like filthy trash mixed with sewage smell... Yuck.  I held my breath until we got inside of the restaurant.  I don't know what it is but the hostess saw us but turned away and we stood there for a several minutes before she came back to seat us.  Here are the items we received:  The big and warm squared corn bread with the honey butter came out for us to enjoy was super yummy.  I didn't even know they give that to customer so that free factor made it super delicious.  Then came the chicken tenders.  Wow, this has to be one of the best chicken tenders I have eaten.  Was light, crisp, and full of flavor.  The fries were skimpy, but it's ok because the star was indeed the tender.  We split an entree, the chicken divan.  The description sounded yummy, but the actual food itself did not live up to it.  It was melted cheese with chunks of chicken and broccoli on top of a massive cornbread, with the same sauce used for the chicken pot pies.  We couldn't eat much of this entree because it was boring and super heavy.    For dessert, we had the red velvet cake with cream cheese and vanilla frosting.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cake itself, but the whipped cream was light, fluffy, creamy, and not too sweet, was GOOD.  We will come back and definitely have the chicken tenders and try out something else."}
{"text":"The pies are ridiculous.  Always good to have when visiting loved ones for any occassions.  Banana cream pie, coconut, chocolate, fresh strawberry pie... I can go on and with the list of likes."}
{"text":"If you are a tourist from the east coast (like us) where there are no Marie Callender's Rest. and you have only had the frozen pies & entrees, then try this restaurant while in LV. Marie is on my list every trip.  I am rating the pie. If you go to a steakhouse you should not order the fish. If you go to a fish house, do not order steak, as a general rule.  We ate and the food is a solid 3 star. However, I came for the pie which we took back to our resort. It cost $5 for a slice of lemon chiffon and we could get the entire pie to go for $11 + some change. That is about 5 big slices. You do the math. It is smarter to buy the pie instead of slices like our waiter recommended. The hard part is getting 4 people to agree on the same pie!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and the food was good. This place was clean and the waiter was nice. We would coming back here."}
{"text":"My mom and I eat at this location regularly...it's a good place to healthy quick meal for lunch. But today was anything but...the service was the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and ask the server to substitute the fries for the wedge salad, and some extra BBQ sauce on the side. The server said no problem. My mom ordered vegie taco and soup off the two item mid-day lunch special. It took forever for the food to come out and when it did come out, my order was wrong. My mom asks for some tobassco sauce and extra pico. The server comes back and said that the cook was fixing the order and that it would take 2 minutes...my mom asks for tobassco sauce again. So, as I'm waiting for my food, I notice that all the customers in her area don't have food on their tables and the server is no where to be found. 20 minutes later, my mom is done eating and I'm still waiting for my food. She brings out my order but this time instead of giving dressing for my wedge salad, she gives me bbq sauce.  I scarf down my food as fast as I can so I don't get back to work late from my anything but a quick lunch.  I ask for a box...time goes by...I ask another server for a box. The server then brings out the check, without asking which piece of pie I want, which she so cheerily announced was included in my meal when she took our order, and runs off...where is this girl hiding at?!? I ask to speak the manager, meanwhile my mom looks at the check and notices that it's all wrong.  The girl charged us for a three item mid-day lunch special and extra soup and instead of substituting my fries for a salad...she charges me for extra side salad. So I didn't get fries, which came with the meal, and was charged for a salad.  So when the manager, who was very curt and couldn't bother to stop a second to speak to us, comes out, she announces that she fixed the check. My mom asks her about the substitution and she said that's how they do it.  REALLY so then I'm thinking...if you're gonna charge me for the fries anyway...I want my fries! But I don't have time to argue with her and just say whatever, paid her and left without pie. Probably will not go back to this location again. I'm guessing that the server's bad customer service stems from the awful management. I see why this is the last location in town but sadly, I don't think this one's gonna last much longer either!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out since all the Marie Calanders spots closed down in LA. They currently had a promotion where you could order a Pot pie that came with a small Caesar side salad & slice of dessert pie for $10, very hard to pass up.   Upon entry, the pie case welcomed me with a preview of pies that would be available. I enjoyed this. It took a couple minutes to be seated, not long at all. As I walked through, I noticed one side of the restaurant was empty (speculation kicked in). The part where we were seated at had other patrons already enjoying their meal.   Our table/booth was clean w/condiments. Politely handed our menus, utensils, and took our drink order. I ordered the Sheppard Pie (ramekin filed with beef stew & topped w/ mashed potatoes & melted cheese) w/ my side Caesar Salad. Glad to say, it's just the way it should be as far as Marie Calendar's. The romaine lettuce in the salad was fresh. For dessert, I choose the Double Cream Blueberry Pie. In my opinion, it was delish. The crust was flaky, not overly buttered. Blueberries were sweet & pungent. And the creme, not too thick or overly sweet.  Service:  seemed like they were really trying to leave a better impression. They were making conscious effort. That is a compliment, I know sometimes it doesn't read like one, but it is.   Quick restroom visit, it was clean and stocked.  I will definitely keep this place in mind down the road."}
{"text":"So we pre-order our meal for Thanksgiving along with a bunch of other people and they run out of whole turkeys so we get 2 turkey breast instead.  OK so that's the good part.    How do you, as a company, do this EVERY year and are still this disorganized?  You had turkeys missing, pies everywhere, can't find the peach pie.   You have ONE person taking your name and physically highlighting the hard copy and repeating your name to the \"grabber\" who runs to the truck, gets the box, runs and gets the pies, forgets the extra sides (because he's only one person and the highlighter girl doesn't do anything but highlight).   They forgot my whip cream too. lame.  If I were running this gig, it would be SO efficient, I would use modern equipment - ya know, like an ipad, walkie talkies, pre-packed boxes, name tags, separate lines, more people.  Really, it's not that hard.   Everything is pre-ordered, how can you get it wrong?  It's predictable.    Food is good though, the process needs work."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. 30 minutes to get drinks. Our Appetizer was so gross (artichoke dip) my mother ended up sick from it. At 1 hr we aaked about our two sandwiches and another waitress brought them to us. They had been under a heat lamp so long we both couldn't bite through the bread. The manager made very little apologies and just told us not to worry about paying, no attempts to get us to come back. Save your tummies, go next door to miller's ale house!"}
{"text":"The place is basic but the food is good! Wait staff pleasant and the food gets to you quickly. Definitely better than Mimi's that is just down the street and they have fruit, carrots and cottage cheese!"}
{"text":"We went here with a big appetite as their food is always great. Service is usually slow, so why would today be any different.  Our hostess seated us, told us our server would be with us shortly. After almost 10 minutes, no one came to take our drink orders or anything. We got up and left. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here, but I ordered a pie from here two months ago.  See, I saw a commercial on TV saying they were having a $5.99 or $6.99 pie sale, and I seemed to remember that they had a delicious Peanut Butter Pie many years ago, so I called them and asked them if they still had it.  They told me they didn't have them ready, but I could order one and pick it up the next day.  I did, and it was delicious.    My roommate: \"Don't ever get this again.\" Me: \"Why, cuz it's so damned good?\" Him: \"Yes!\""}
{"text":"It certainly is not \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"   I am in no way \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  It would be \"A-OK.\" if total checks rang up to about half of what they end up being.   So, it is certainly a \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"   I would include dinner and the pies in that assessment.   Service is not award-winning, but it is hardly \"I'll never step foot in here again\" either.  The male restroom is worse than the ones at nearby Sam Boyd Stadium, and I do not care one bit about someone calling that hyperbole. It is actually true. (I checked.) (I am certain you would not like pictures.) (\"Eek! Methinks not.\")  And one time we patronised this Marie Callender's before a Rebels game, they did not have ice cream. (How the fuck do you rely on pies as your #1 claim-to-fame, and you allow your freezer to run out of ice cream? You have got to be kidding. *looks around for hidden cameras*)   Marie Callender needs to stop by and clean house. - E"}
{"text":"Today was the first time eating at this location and it was great. I had lunch at the Rainbow location a while back and it wasn't good at all. Poor service, food below what I was used to Marie Callender's to be, so I had backed off. But this Sahara restaurant was excellent, the food was hot and fresh and Jessica was a great server. I grew up in L.A. and ate many times at the Northridge location on Tampa and it was always excellent, never a miss. I'm glad I found out this place is just as good, and I live very close by. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Marie Callender's over the weekend they charged me three times for one chicken pot pie when I want to talk to the manager he was very rude about it and when I asked there was something I could do to reimburse me they offered me two muffins they were very rude and don't waste your time or money in this place"}
{"text":"I'd really give this 2.5 stars, but three would be too many.  I had the Classic Cobb Salad.  My wife had the Lemon Grilled Chicken.  Service was good, but the place is just so so.  I think it's well over-priced for what you get.  No appetizers, no desserts, two iced teas and the above dishes and our bill was $33 before tip.  I did feel quite good, however, when I realized that the median age of the people in the place was greater than my age.  Geez, a youngster out on a date.  That's OK though.  I know the Callendar's draws a large clientele of gray hairs like me and I'm cool with that.  I guess the only reason to visit Marie anymore is to have some pie and some coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was good. Cornbread is served with butter for the appetizer. My French Dip sandwich was served with flavorful au jus. My husband enjoyed his burger. For dessert he ordered a slice of pecan pie and I had the cheesecake. Both were really tasty. Hits the spot if you're looking for some good old fashioned comfort food."}
{"text":"I used to love Marie C's but not do much anymore the food is mediocre but the service is horrific!  The management definitely needs to retrain their staff and need some training themselves.  The service was so bad I complained with the manager and she literally had nothing to say and didn't appear to care.  I may go back for a pie sometimes but done with the restaurant the only reason they even got 2 stars is for the dessert"}
{"text":"No, not the store bought ones in the freezer section! The freshly made, on site, delicious pies that only can be found at Marie Callendars! I would say that every pie in here is the bomb, but I can't get past eating the banana cream each time! It's just so rich, light, and full of ripened bananas! We did sample the blueberry cream, and once again it's going to blow you away! The chocolate satin is another favorite of ours that's just so smooth and creamy without tasting like a fake chocolate pie. They have a full menu of about a dozen pies to choose from, and a even bigger menu of entrees! These are slowly dying out in the Vegas valley as you used to seemingly see them on every corner. As times change, so do people's interests I guess? I find it hard to believe that something so good is down to about 3-4 locations? This southern gentleman would give them a five, but because of those pies, I've never tried the regular menu!"}
{"text":"I actually ate here twice this week and ordered the same thing, their regular cheeseburger...  For some reason have been craving hamburgers...Anyways Marie Callender's may not be the first place that comes to one's mind when wanting a hamburger but let me tell you-they have one yummy delicious hamburger.  I don't know what they season their beef with but it's tasty!  Had the fries the first visit-they were fine.  Chose their cajun onion rings last night.  The coating was good but the onions did not taste fully cooked.  MC's also offers corn bread when you first sit down-OMG still as tasty as I rememember!  Like cake!  Comes with honey butter...I still like their cornbread over their pies!    Which brings me to their pies...Right now they have a hamburger combo that includes a slice of pie.  I chose the banana cream, my hubby chose the Red Velvet Dream pie (part cake/part pie)...  I thought the Red Velvet was a tad too sweet and not in a good way...  I give the service an A+- Both nights the servers and host were friendly and very attentive!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. New menu items were a nice surprise! Place was busy but our server, Meya was great. Very personable and friendly. Apologized for the wait, which obviously couldn't be helped. She brought refills promptly and was sweet with our little girl. They have a great employee in her! Oh and shoit out to the Ortega Chicken Sandwich! So goood"}
{"text":"A $12 dollar salad with fake chicken. No thank you. I chewed on the chicken for 2 minutes before spitting it out. Put real chicken on these expensive salads. I can get a cheaper, better salad across the street at Wendy's."}
{"text":"Purchased 2 pies tonight (apple & pumpkin) for Thanksgiving.  We decided to cut into apple pie (couldn't wait til' Thursday) and realized immediately, it was half filled and dry. Top of pie caved in as soon as I cut into it.   Taste like a pie you could find at a cheap buffet. I drove all the way out to Hendertuckey to this location, waste of time. Next time, I'll buy pies in my neck of the woods.   Uploaded photos - Gross. Not worth $24.00."}
{"text":"This location does very low volume business for it's size except for its pie sales. The restaurant is always less than half full in spite of email coupons.   We were regulars in the past but are tired of getting sick from food poisoning. When confronted the management goes into full denial and accuses us of plotting against them like some low life's.  The wait staff are wonderful but I do not know how they can continue to hurt people like they do. The county health district tells us they do not have the resources to follow up on all the reports they get about other restaurants as well.  We are done here and take another dirty dining location off our list We are determined to eat at home more and be poisoned less."}
{"text":"Went to the one on stephanie. The woodwork on the walls was banged up and walls chipped. No greeting at door. Food was sub par. High prices for small amount of food. The one dish to rely on, potato soup, was gluey and potatoes were not cooked thru. Had no taste of cheese. Wait staff was heard apologizing to other guests that there were only 2 cooks so food was long in coming out. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was amazing!  Heidi was one of the nicest people... She is worth the to come back"}
{"text":"This location is easily seen on West Sahara Ave. pretty close to Cimarron. Lot of parking since it is situated on the corner of the strip mall center. Since we live on the west side now, this is our location MC's (we did frequent the main one for lunch, on East Sahara, when it was our old neighborhood- and we belong to the e-club so we get promotions from time to time). When we visited, it didn't look like there were too many cars in the parking lot.   We got the special of the month, to go- Celebration Cake Pie at $8.99 (the other special was lemon meringue) plus tin, which is $9.79. We had 8 tins to return which was $6.40 (their recycling program is a good incentive), so the final cost was $3.39. We never tried this one before, and this one is pretty decadent since it is essentially two desserts in one! I liked it. It is different. But, yeah, I opted for a small piece.    My favorite pies are Pumpkin and (Seasonal only) Strawberry. I can hardly wait for the pie sale (usually 2x a year- minus the cheesecakes)."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat cheap and friendly ! Salad / soup bar is good but no too much choice. Soup are good. Employees are professional (just one young man who talked strong to others servers \"we close in 15 minutes \" it was just 7:15 pm lol)... Large choice of pies and muffins."}
{"text":"I always get take out from this place and the people are always nice and the food is always awesome!  Annnnd Shout out to the girl who took my Togo order and told me the passion fruit mango iced tea was delicious because she was right and now I'm craving it ! Thanks girl :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a nice sit down lunch. Took them awhile to seat us and even longer to bring us what we ordered.  I ordered the cheesy potato soup and cornbread and it was delicious but needed to be hotter in the temperature department. My boyfriend had the chili and cornbread which he seemed to enjoy. It came on the cutest cast iron skillet.  The prices were adequate for the nice portions too ranging from 7.99-8.99 for soup isn't bad. They had every pie flavor imaginable and these huge muffins that looked delicious.   Now about the service. Slooooooowest and most awkward service ever in a restaurant that was not that busy at 1pm.   The service was so slow that by the time we left we were senior citizens. Lol"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! Tonight I ordered a pan of cornbread to go. It was spoiled! Too bad my daughter and I ate a piece to find out. They better hope we don't get sick. My husband called to report it and the incompetent manager Guillermo had his nerves to only offer a new pan of cornbread?! Nobody wants your spoiled cornbread!! The WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Corporate will definitely be hearing from me!"}
{"text":"Their coconut cream pie and lemon cream cheese pie is life changing. So good. The service is subpar as usual and I always order for pick-up.  Note: You can't order a whole pie and dine-in there because the whole pie is $13 but a slice is $5."}
{"text":"Not sure who the Blonde waitress was, but super rude and she actually told us at 11:05am that the toasters were put away so there was no toasted bread for sandwiches... Really!?!?! Then, a plain garden salad was ordered, with \"no nothing, just salad\" and if course she brought some loaded salad with croutons, tomatoes carrots....whatever was all on it. When we said it was suppose to be salad with nothing on it... She made a rude comment that she \"guessed\" she could bring another..... Just bring what we ordered!  We just left.... After passed great service & food, this was a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience with this store.   They had messed up on a to go order and they were very courteous on fixing the situation.  Manager Jackie was awesome.  She was very nice and even gave us a free pie for our trouble.  Not used to the great customer service from anywhere as well as this was handled:)"}
{"text":"Nothing beats their pie sale.  October and February, I believe. My fave is the lemon cream cheese.  I had a refusal for my fave, because it was sold out, so, I went with a stellar replacement,  Chocolate Satin.  My son called it chocolate Satan....oh my.   There's truth in them words."}
{"text":"Don't go here on Thanksgiving.  First off, I went alone and the wait was to be 30 minutes but ended up being 70 minutes.    Was seated and the buser and server were both very friendly.  Cornbread and soup were good.  I ordered the turkey which was very dry.    Being alone I ate quickly, waited about 20-25 min after eating before my server came around to ask if I wanted my pie.  Then waited 10 more min for her to come around to ask if I wanted a box and I said yes and would take my pie to go since it never came.   I also asked if I could get a small side of gravy to go.  10-15 more minutes and she realized she forgot me again.  Got my to-go boxes (no bag or gravy).    I planned to tip $20 for her working a holiday bit tipped $10 and now wish less but had already filled it out.    I would say the manager needs better training.  I was seated back booth by the kitchen and the manger must have stood by my booth 10 times and never once looked at me, in fact kinda grossed my out I think he was sick and I found it rude him hovering, lingering, leaning on the side of my booth.  Not once did I see him ask any guest how the meal was or not once did I see him helping his very busy servers.  Had the manager even blinked at me, he would have had a 4 seat booth open 40 minutes instead of me just sitting there waiting that long to leave.    The manager shouldn't act above the staff in fact that he can't clear a table or run food out.  It was a busy day but no excuses especially when I only saw him standing around.  He's not friendly to guest, that should be his priority.    I will only go back to order pie to-go.  The other Marie Calendars in town has better service."}
{"text":"Located on W. Sahara in the T-Mobile shopping center. Parking is not a issue. This location is never too busy. Dine in and ToGo accommodations.   Marie Callendars has been my go to place for a decent hot meal lately when I don't feel like cooking. I always order ToGo online which is extremely convenient.   I always order the lemon crusted salmon with veggies. The salmon is always so warm and moist and served hot. I literally devour it in 3 bites. Lol.   I love the avocado shrimp stack appetizer, served with tortilla chips - Yummy!   I've never received bad customer service here. It's usually quiet inside. Decorated nicely."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I'd been to a Marie Callendar's, and my boyfriend and I decided to grab dinner here as it was getting late one night. I was pleasantly surprised at the new menu, which feels more updated and has a pretty good range of options. It was actually hard to narrow down what we wanted. Also, they serve beer now!  All of the food we've had here has been great, and the range of pie flavors is on point. As someone who lives for dessert, Marie Callendar's pies do not disappoint. The cream varieties are to die for, as is the razzleberry.   Service is pretty good, but it's best when there are fewer customers to tend to. You might have to wait a few minutes to be seated, as the host/hostess stand is not always staffed and there can be some confusion as to who wants to eat and who just wants to buy pie at the counter. All the waiters/waitresses have been delightful, though!  Seriously, don't forget to order a piece of pie when you are there."}
{"text":"I just got an apple and pumpkin pie tonight at Maries location on West Sahara. Today is 10/7/17. This apple pie has soooo much sugar in it , I am HIGHLY dissapointed. I have been getting pies at this restaurant in this town for 25 years and this may be the worst I have ever had. Its literally as if they poured 1 whole cup of sugar or more in this 1 pie. Wish me luck trying  the pumpkin tommorow...stay tuned"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I  got sick from coffee I ordered. I wanted to order some pie so I  waited 20 minutes , no one came. Five minutes later chubby waiter with glasses looked right in our faces and walked away.  Then started serving people who came way after us and still ignored us.  Another ten minutes later a waiter with neck tattoo took our menu away even though we didnt order anything yet. I really don't know why, I really felt like my party and I were really not wanted there.  All I wanted was a piece of pie and after 30 minutes of waiting walked away with nothing except excruciating stomach ache from their coffee. I will never go to that place again."}
{"text":"do not order your holiday take out meal here! we were promised 20 minutes to be ready. it took one hour! family was beyond irate. created a christmas afternoon mood....."}
{"text":"I met up here with a friend to chit chat over a meal. We usually meet up at Krazy Buffet but since I had a wake up call with my health I'm trying to eat better! I'm no expert so I'm just playing everything by ear.   They had this great soup and salad deal going on for around $8.00. I had the Apple Gorgonzola & Walnut Salad with the cheese on the side though. It came with Cranberries, Candied Walnuts, Green Apples with Balsamic vinaigrette. It also came with a small Hearty Vegetable soup that wasn't salty. They were both really good ...I didn't feel disappointed in my choices because it wasn't bland or unexciting."}
{"text":"Have missed this place since we don't have it in LHC! And they didn't let me down! Great brunch as usual! Staff friendly and service was prompt! A+  Wish I would have brought a cooler with me to buy their amazing pies to bring home with me... next go around."}
{"text":"did breakfast here with my daughter.  food was good.  just didnt understand why it took so long for them to get the food out to us because it wasnt that busy at all.  ive been to other Marie Callender's and they were pretty fast with their service.  i will always remember Marie Callender's for there Tuna Sandwich and their huge Pot Pies."}
{"text":"well i have to say we weren't in our Sunday best like most around us seeing how we were recovering from the late night before they weren't judgemental....but they did have cholula lol which blew my mind i will be back the food was great"}
{"text":"Sad to say that the Marie Callender's restaurants of yesteryear fame, fine food and delicious pies, are a thing of the past. We have long since given up ordering meals here after a we had 2 chicken pies with nothing but gravy and only a few peas, one carrot with two mini bites of chicken in them. Recently however, after a dinner we drove across town with some friends so that we could enjoy a dessert of their fresh peach pie. We were happy to see that they had a whole peach pie in the bakery area as we entered.   What transpired after we we were seated and placed our order, most certainly helps to explain why these restaurants are closing. The waitress returned and said that they were out of peach pie. When we mentioned that there was one in the bakery cabinet she stated that they could not cut into those pies to serve in the restaurant. We then said that we would buy the whole pie in the cabinet and asked if they could give us some plates.   The answer was an abrupt no. Customers are not allowed to buy a whole pies and eat it in the restaurant. Further, the waitress went on to say that they never cut their fruit pies in slices to serve in the restaurant because to is too hard for them to cut the slices, therefore they just cut a slice of pie crust and slop the fruit on top.   Needless to say we did not get peach pie and left."}
{"text":"I had lunch with 4 friends. The service was bad; we had to call out in chorus to get the waitress's attention after she delivered the food. She never checked on the table again, or even looked our way. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings. She delivered french fries instead. The hamburger had gristle and unpleasant hard things in it when I bit down. Ugh."}
{"text":"The 2016 National Day 25 Review Challenge/    Review 7 of 25:     Today Marie Callendar was on my calendar : The National Day Calendar  (http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/latest-posts/). Today was National Blueberry Pie Day. Being that I was nearby in Barnes & Noble and that Marie Callender's has a reputation for pies, I celebrated it in the Henderson Marie Callender's.      The method to my madness of observing at least 25 National Days is really to try new places, celebrate different foods and places. My observance of blueberry pie brought me through the doors of a restaurant chain that I had never set foot in before: Marie Callender's. My taste of Marie Callender's came from the box of their frozen foods dinner. When a restaurant sells their dinners in the frozen foods department of a supermarket, I am in no hurry to try it. But a National Day can change mindsets.      When I walked inside Marie Callender's, it was quiet. And when I walked in, I did not see a hostess. In the days of smartphone photography, I appreciate the opportunity to take pictures  that waiting for the hostess to show up allows. Likewise I appreciate looking at the overhead menu. When it comes to the overhead menu, for whatever reason it displays more flavors than the website. Fast forward a couple of minutes later and Vanessa my waitress walked me to the table with a plate glass window view of Stephanie Street. I knew that I wanted the blueberry pie. I also knew that I recently had myself a decent size Weiss Deli breakfast causing me to pass over having ice cream on the blueberry pie. When Vanessa asked me if I wanted the blueberry pie warmed up, I said \"yes.\"       A few minutes later, the National Day icon the blueberry arrived on my table. When I looked at the star of National Day, it was a wide toasty pie loaded with blueberries. In observance of the blueberry pie, I took a picture that I posted on Yelp and dug in. My only complaint was that I ordered the coffee with it. To put it kindly if their pies tasted like their coffee, they would be out of businesses. Their coffee tasted like it came out of the  Colorado River. Going between the coffee and blueberry pie was a Foodie dance of Yummy and yuck. It spoiled the experience. I am glad that Vanessa never asked me if I wanted a refill on coffee. Marie Callender's needs to step up on their coffee because it brings the place down.      This Marie Callender's needs a busboy or somebody to assist Vanessa. When I looked to my right there were four tables in a row with dirty utensils and plates. As I mentioned earlier, it took a few minutes for somebody to seat me when the restaurant was virtually empty.      The bill came out to around $7.50. The slice of blueberry pie was $4.29 and the cup of coffee was $2.50.    It took me around 12 years to step foot in Marie Callender's. It might take the same amount of time to return to this location. But who knows, I never say never with a restaurant I rated three stars. With a few more National Pie Days ahead, I would like to try the three other Marie Callender's in Las Vegas. As far as drinking their coffee, no way!"}
{"text":"The chili and cornbread is always good, but when did they start putting pico on the chili? The cornbread felt like it was microwaved, but maybe not. Either way the food including the pie is still yummy."}
{"text":"It's mothers day today, and all the restaurant's We're so busy.  We went to Maria calendar we ordered a spinach deep. ... It was very very  oily ..... We ordered a chocolate pie and it's looks like Someone did a nice  dip finger on the top of the cream Over the pie It's was my first and last time for me here"}
{"text":"Try the breakfast!  I never knew they served breakfast till my boyfriend suggested we stop by.  Their free breakfast loaf was amazing, especially with a little razzleberry jam.  And of course, their pies are great, although a little over priced.  I tried out a chocolate muffin that looked more like a cup cake, and wasn't all that impressed.  It seemed kinda dry and bland, so I'll prob stick with their pies when I want a dessert."}
{"text":"I always go for their fresh strawberry pies.  They'll make it fresh for you (if it's in season of course)  bring your old tins to save a few cents."}
{"text":"Great place to take mom or Grandma!! Excellent attentive service! The frisco burger is super yum! Or forget that menu and get the soup and salad buffet, fresh fruit and chunks of meat. Every table gets corn bread, and don't forget to leave with there seasonal pie!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service from the time we walked in the door!  Greeted by multiple people put in our own room and Denise"}
{"text":"I was SOOOO DISAPPOINTED and this was my first visit ever!!  You first have to understand my obsession I had with Marie Callender frozen Pot Pies.  One fall and winter in Michigan, I ate them every day, my favorite was the Honey Chicken Pot Pie.  Mostly I would just heat it up in the micro because I did not want to wait an hour for it to cook in the oven.  And although the microwaved pie was not as flakey as when you bake it in the oven, it was still better than the Chicken Pot Pie I ate last night at Marie Callender's restaurant!    I was craving pot pie and 3 of us decided she would have the best.  We walked into what felt like an oven, the heat was up so high I thought their ovens broke and they were baking food on heat vents.  The friendly lady behind the counter said it was because \"They\" the employees were complaining it was \"Cold\"....I am all for employees being happy, after all a happy work environment makes for better service\"   But come on, it was I swear like 85 degrees inside!!  We were sat and Landon was introduced as our server.  He brought out our drinks, my sisters Lemonade was as clear as water and he said yeah it is because it might be off back there...ok then why would you still bring it out?    He brought out our corn bread, well one tiny slice and 3 appetizer plates, I was under the impression we all 3 would get our own piece but it was only enough for one person.    Finally the food came out, we all ordered the pot pie, it looked like it was going to be delicious but I realized that the crust was only over a white dish, there was not going to be an actual pie crust at all.  Even though the crust on top was not burnt, it had a burt taste to it.  The chicken in my pot pie was not the right color either, it had a pinkish hue to it and the flavor was SENSATIONALLY SALTY!  I thought I was going to have a heart attack if I finished the entire thing.  I was only able to get one refill of iced tea and I had to ask Landon to bring me extra lemons, I never understand why when you order an Iced Tea with lemon, the first glass always has a lemon, but the following never do unless you ask for it.....or you have a good server that realized your original order was in faced an Iced Tea with lemon.    As we were eating, I over heard from the kitchen area, since our table had a lovely view of it, some woman complaining that she was not closing and then went off on an older employee, a grandma type about not doing something right for a birthday thing or something, I just stared at her like \"why are you talking to someone so sweet and old like that lady?!\"     While we were walking out I was behind my party and this server was actually walking so close to me I was stepped on twice, when I turned around she looked at me like I needed to get out of her way so I just slowed down....Bitch, you are at work, you are going no where you do not need to be walking all over me to get to a table, now back it off!!!\"  Never once did she apologize for stepping on my shoe twice.  The best part of the night was when we exited the main doors, we walked into a huge cloud of our servers cigarette smoke, I am pretty sure they are not allowed to smoke in front of the entrance...I am a non smoker and I understand that smokers really could give to shits about me, but seriously, when you are at work, take your ass behind the building, I know most restaurants have designated smoking areas for their employees!!!  I should not have to walk through your cloud of smoke.....and to top that off Landon looked at us, blew out more smoke, never once said \"thanks for coming in\" or \"have a good night\", nope he just puffed on that cigarette and moved out of our way a few feet.    I definitely will not eat at this place again. It makes me sad, I thought by eating at the actual restaurant you would receive a better pie than what is in the frozen section of your local grocery....and since you were paying 12.99 for each pie, what a waste!  I would rather spend like 3 dollars and some change and make it in my microwave.    Dear Marie,  Why does the food you serve in your restaurant loaded with salt, taste like crap, and extremely over priced?!  I think you should just stick to frozen food!!!  Love,  Pedro"}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service. My boyfriend has been on queue for a $150 refund since November and has came back to them several times now asking what happened to his refund. One of the managers is responsible for it and she has yet to call him back or address him. According to another manager, she should have gotten back to him by now, but she still hasn't. This is by no means fair and I don't know why she hasn't gotten fired yet. Is this any way of running a restaurant? I think not."}
{"text":"I go here for pies all the time cause my dad loves them. so in addition to a pie I ordered 2 items for dinner a Frisco burger for my dad and a meatloaf sandwhich for me. the first thing you notice is how greasy everything is and it's definetly unhealthy but to top it off I had a micro thin piece of nasty, crusty, 3 day old meatloaf on my sandwhich so gross and unacceptable,I deserve a refund for that and would appreciate someone from the restaurant reaching out to me to offer that. The pie was good as usual. I also had a chocolate chip cookie while I waited kinda stale on the edges ,not first rate. Anyways,from now on I'll stick to what they do best...pies."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed right now.  Ordered the Whole Turkey & Spiral Ham Feast. looked fine in the Box. When i got home ready to pre-pare the food i turned over the Ham only to find 7 greenish White Mold all over the Ham. They are 40mins away Round Trip. Now i have to Drive back to return it!. Wasted almost 2 hours on my xmas eve."}
{"text":"I was excited to come to Marie Callanders because way back when I lived in Mpls it was one of my parents favorite restaurants and has not operated there in many years. We visited for a late lunch on a Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. The hostess and the waitress seemed tense, lots of canned smiles and comments. It didn't come off as genuine and made it kinda awkward.                                                                                                                A standard here is to start off with hot cornbread. Mmmm, I do love cornbread. My parents had pot roast with mashed potatoes, veggies and gravy, they made lots of comments on how delicious it was. My cousin had a burger and fries, nothing outstanding, my fish tacos that I shared with my dad were wonderful. The food was good, hot and portions are large. We didn't have room for pie which is a known specialty for this restaurant. I think I'll come back for desert another time, strawberry pie sounds tempting!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location numerous times over the past years.  Service and food have been consistently very good.  My favorite pies are:  double cream lemon, and lemon cream cheese.  For the first time ever I stopped by and purchased items from the \"Thanksgiving tent\".  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they sell gravy.  It never occurred to me that I could buy it from them instead of worrying about making my own at home (hit or miss).  So, from now on I plan on getting some 'back up' gravy each year!"}
{"text":"3.5~!!!  The last time we came to Marie Callender's I was very disappointed so when my mom dragged me here because she was craving their French onion soup I was not excited.. I will say that I've noticed MC definitely attracts more of the \"older crowd\" haha  Service on this day was very slow and the food seemed to take forever but when we got our food I was pleasantly surprised...   -Grilled Salmon with Fresh Strawberry-Mango Salsa = DELICIOUS the salmon was fresh as well as all of the fruit.. I loved the coconut sauce/rice it came with and I also loved the side salad it came with that was topped with more yummy fruit!  - Rosemary Chicken with Potatoes and Broccoli (560 calories) part of their \"delightful dishes\" simple but still tasty and it's good to see some healthier options at MC..   I think MC needs to lower their prices though.. most of their entrées seemed to be $16+ which, to me, seems a bit steep for MC..  HOT TIP: Strawberry pie.. just do it."}
{"text":"Please note we went here for pie only and probably an hr before they closed.. The waitress was as nice as can be, I loved her attitude =very helpful older lady. I have always wanted to try rubharb pie and I finally did oh my so great. My bf went with apple pie - (what he was craving )eventhough you can order that almost anywhere..I had a great time but $12.00 + tip for 2 slices of pie a la mode.. yikes. I could have bought a whole pie for cheaper.. but I have no need for an entire pie with only 2 people living in my house. lol. I'd def. go back for desert. one day i'll try the food."}
{"text":"I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I can not get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house. Stick with small bakeries ."}
{"text":"Outstanding Coconut Cream Pie - went last night for their special of 7.99 per pie to take home, it was excellent and half price than normal. Very happy :)"}
{"text":"A great place for Breakfast!!!! I went to Hash House across the street and it was to crowded so came to Marie Callender's and I'm glad I did!!! Me and my Wife had a huge breakfast for under 30 bucks!!! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. For the terrible service I received from the front desk older pie selling lady who would not sell me a pie because I didn't have my identification on me and wouldn't accept my card without it. That would be understandable if it was consistent  with the fact that I have been several times  and no one has ever asked for my identification. Also keep in mind this one is a block from a gym and I just bring my card and want pie after my workout.I see why all the marie calendars r going out of business. First off there were 3 customers in the building for dinner. Congrats guys you can make a pie but not dinner.  Second won't let customers purchase anything.  If I was sitting at a table and bought dinner and didn't have identification what would u have done then. Would dinner be free since I didn't have it. So news to Marie's you are not the best pie makers in the world I have been coming here for ages and will never ever ever ever ever buy a single thing from u again and will tell all my friends how worthless you are with customer service and consistency. And trust me when I say you suck big time. And I dislike you   A lot. I hope you all go out of business. The old pie lady at the front please retire your not nice."}
{"text":"Place was clean.  The pies and muffins at the front were inviting.  Ask for Kerry, she is the friendliest waitress.  Food arrived in a timely manner.  I even ordered banana-strawberry cream pie and peach pie to go."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced.  One hour & one-half to be served a cold sandwich and pie & coffee.   I asked that the pie be slightly warmed, but it was not, the coffee was almost cold as well as being regular instead of decaf as I ordered. Needless to say, I was awake for 5 hours afterwards.   I have been patronizing Marie Callender's for over 30 years, and this waitress was the worst.  No one was helping her hone her skills either. Mary W."}
{"text":"Lousy service.  Food was ok.  Fries were cold.  Server never asked about refills for drinks."}
{"text":"I ended up here today after a bad experience trying to be seated at Tony Roma's across the street (see review).  However, once I got my food, I wished I had stayed at Tony Roma's!  We rarely visit this place because their prices are UNGODLY considering what you get.  $4.49 to add on a trip to the salad bar, and $2.69 for a drink.  Ridiculous.    I ordered the rosemary chicken with baby potatoes and broccoli.  The chicken could only be described as \"freak meat\" because it had the consistency of a pencil eraser.  The broccoli was cold, and the potatoes were not done in the middle so they crunched when I bit into them.  Eww.  I sent the whole plate back and just asked for it to be removed from my check - the food made me lose my appetite, to be honest, because it didn't even look good.  My fiancé got a fried fish and shrimp plate.  It was small, and he said the food was cold.  I had to laugh, because he kept making this awful face while he was eating like he was choking the food down.  If we ever visit Marie Callender's, it's usually for my fiancé's pie craving... which isn't even THAT good either.  I'd rather make him a pie myself.  Why, oh why, do we ever end up here?  It's always a mistake..."}
{"text":"Have visited this location twice, once for lunch the other for breakfast.  Good food, friendly waitress.  Good value.  Purchased a banana cream pie to take home.   Absolutely the best ever!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey breast package for Christmas dinner. Got the order after a 20 minute wait. Good thing I checked it. Instead of the turkey breast I was given a whoke turkey in shrink wrap. I told them that the order was wrong. They argued with me eventhough I showed them the receipt. I asked for a manager.  A manager came over with an attitude asking what the problem was. He took the receipt and check the order. Told,someone to go get a turkey breast. Instead of placing it in the box he just handed it to me. Reheated the meal the next day on Christmas. The breast tasted old and dry. The stuffing was also dry. The pumpkin pie was burned. This meal package cost $119.00 and was not worth it. Their food is getting worse and worse. Would have,been better off getting the turkey dinner meal from Smith's or Albersons."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a yummy dinner here last night. The green bean app is one of my favs and we decided to try their tacos for the first time, all were very tasty! Ended the meal with a creamy cheesecake slice, it was so good!! Glad we stopped in and thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some muffins this morning.  They have a great deal.  Buy 4 large muffins you get 4 free.  Or simply you purchase 8 muffins for under $12.  The muffins are huge and moist!  Way better than anything you would buy at some grocery store.  I've eaten at this location many times in the past.  The food is great and so is the quality!  Good size portions and always something new on their specials menu.  The staff is friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"This Marie Calendar's is located within a busy shopping mall/ strip which caused us to stop in to grab a bite to eat for dinner. The menu is quite extensive and the staff is friendly but the food is poor. The presentation of the food looked amazing,  but the taste lacked luster. My mom ordered chicken nuggets that were really rubbery which signified they were overly cooked and my hamburger was super greasy and falling apart after the first bite. The only reason why this place received three stars was because one the staff was friendly, 2 it was in a central location and 3 it wasn't very crowded. Other than that, I believe this restaurant really needs a renovation in order to turn it's cooking stuff around and it's interior design  needs to be updated as well."}
{"text":"Came in for dessert. Around 7ish. Waited almost 30 minutes for cheesecake. We Walked out. Thanks for the coffee while I waited Marie. Btw Marie I had to wait for about 15 minutes for it."}
{"text":"Wow skimpy meals. Worse than their frozen line of TV dinners. Ppl gotta come try this for a laugh. They are price gougers!!! Food resembles prison or assisted living food. All cans"}
{"text":"After a 40 minute wait for my order to be served to us, at Coco's (Sunset Station), found this restaurant..It was great..seated promptly, Order taken quickly. Waitress made some meal recommendations. While we waited for our meal, served us a warmed blueberry muffin (no charge). Meal brought promptly. Hot and very tasty (SW scramble & standard breakfast meal) Only complaint..Hash browns way overdone. But it was close to luncheon switchover. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Just got thru having a fabulous meal here with exceptional service, food was fast & hot. Not to forget the free cornbread served before the meal ! Kudos to the place for serving such amazing food and price point was just right.. We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Very slow this morning, thought coming early we'd miss the church crowd however with only two tables still had to wait five minutes to be sitted, the one sever for the place and he wants to be social and talk family with one of the other tables.   They gave us the special menu Monday through Saturday for breakfast with special prices, so when my husband wanted to order, they informed him it would be two dollars price difference. He decided to order a full stack pancakes and side of sauage, what he got was a short stack ( two pancakes) and his sauage. He's still hungry!  I ordered the BTA which was the bacon omelete, hash browns and toast, mine was good!   Service was poor waited on refills never came, asked for check took forever and check out we took it up ourselves! Their pies are good!"}
{"text":"Went to Maries Callender's last week and our servers name was James. Exceptional service. He was so kind and sweet and really went above and beyond to make our visit spectacular. Usually we don't come here to eat but I just really wanted pie so we ate dinner and then had dessert. I had the chicken cesar salad and it was pretty good. Probably an 8 on a scale of 10. My brother said he loved the soup as did my Grandma. And of course we all loved the dessert so all in all we had a great experience here(:"}
{"text":"We ate here last Sunday. There were tables sitting dirty all around us the entire time we were there. I counted 6. No one came by to clear anything off the tables and as people left, more were left uncleaned. The food was ok - overpriced for what it is. For dessert, we ordered a slice of banana cream pie and the bananas were black inside. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I read all the bad reviews and I have to say I didn't have the same experience.  We went last Friday after bowling at Sunset Station.  My friend's son wanted Meat Loaf so we thought this would be the perfect place.  It was really slow for a Friday night - not a lot of people dining here.   We were seated promptly and the waitress knew the menu very well and offered suggestions.  The kids ordered from the kid's menu and the adults ordered from the barbeque menu.  The adults all ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich with fries which was delicious.  All the meals came with a choice of desert.  I chose Chocolate cream pie which was very yummy - I actually thought I had died and went to heaven. What I really liked about it was that it was very cold.  The kids ordered ice cream sundaes and seemed to really enjoy it.  My only complaint was how long it took to get water and refreshments and then she never came back to collect our payment so we had to walk our payment up to the front but other than that I was very pleased for comfort food that evening we all were craving."}
{"text":"Four couples went there this morning for breakfast, each with a 2-for-1 entree coupon. The manager wouldn't honor the coupon for each couple because the small print said only two coupons could be used for four people and we were eight people!  Unbelievable!!! Never going there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Marie Callender's. The problem is it seems that since I last came here years ago the portions have gotten smaller,  the pot pies have shrunk, and the prices have gone up. The service tonight was not very good -the waiter pretty much ignored us. We were never asked if we wanted more water or anything else to drink -coffee? Dessert? The busboy was a lot more attentive than our waiter was, but of course he was busy clearing tables.   I love pot pies.  I really thought Marie Callender's would be good, but the chicken tasted fake -like they came from a can. The vegetables taste like they started out frozen. For over $12 The pot pie is definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I have decided not to go there again.  It's a chain that's totally west coast, so as a native west coaster, I've been going there for decades.   BUT the service is crap!  Every time we go it's a hassle.  It's a hassle to get the attention of the host.  It's a hassle to order your food.  They don't know who the check goes to as they passed around some poor guy's credit card to three tables b/f they got it right.   For mother's day, we left after an hour of not getting the food while we had kids!  Seriously, WTF!   Time to order out for Mimi's!  That took 15 minutes.  Mimi's it is!"}
{"text":"Worst food, and worst service ever! Ordered quiche with chicken Waldorf salad and a small apple cranberry salad with some kind of awful brown dressing, tasted nasty  Empty iced tea glass empty coffee cup, just horrible service. I had to give 1 star, wish I didn't have to do that. Mom ordered bbq tri tip, and 4 little shrimp . This restaurant just lost a 25 year customer. Goodbye."}
{"text":"If you love cold \"glue\" soup and terrible service...this is the place for you! Went there today for a quick lunch with my sister on my quest to try all things pumpkin and was really let down.  Negatives 1) Our waitress forgot we were there and then forgot our drinks, then after getting our drinks, never refilled them again. 2) Soup was delivered cold. Yum, my favorite....Not! (Yeah, I went all 90's on it) 3)Not a cheap place to eat - 2 bowls of soup and 1 piece of pie and I'm out $30!  Positives 1) The cornbread and honey butter was good 2) The pumpkin pie was tasty and will probably make my pumpkin list, however next time I will just go buy a whole pie and take it home.  Sorry guys, its a no - go!"}
{"text":"My Husband and Grandson went to this West Sahara Marie Callender for dinner and we were very disappointed we had the salad bar & ice tea and had to ask for refills on tea and the salad was terrible sitting out to long and the ranch dressing was sour so we didn't even eat it never going back !!!"}
{"text":"Got the 2 for 30 & a mini pot pie meal for my sister. I got the shrimp tacos because when I used to come and get them they were amazing. My first bite I tasted mold. Something tasted beyond moldy and disgusting. I called the manager over, surprised he didn't come over right away usually they should, and he didn't apologize or anything. He asked if I wanted something else. Of course I don't want anything else if I just swallowed something moldy.. Service isn't good and the food clearly isn't either. Save your money"}
{"text":"Always have love Marie's place. However, this trip was different. We were there on Sunday evening. Our waitress scared the crap out of us. She was a crack head that was so strung out, we were constantly afraid of things being dumped in our laps. She was friendly and tried real hard, however, she was scary. She couldn't stand still, couldn't stand in one place for over 10 seconds. Her arms were waving out of control and she was all over the place. The food was so-so. Who ever heard of putting garlic toast under a hot turkey sandwich. Yech. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remembered. Sent the food back as it tasted off. Pies seemed a bit odd too. Frozen and defrosted? Texture wasnt quite right."}
{"text":"Well, I won't ever order from here again. Placed a to-go order online.  Appetizer and two entrees.  From the options for sides included with the entrees, we both chose a side salad. Received my confirmation online.  My husband went to go pick it up and they refused to give him the salads.   Wait... what?  Manager says salads aren't an option as a side for the entrees.  That's weird, cuz your online ordering system offered it to me as an option, that's what I picked,  and that is what my receipt says.   Nope.  Not giving us the salads.  We have to choose French Fries, cole slaw,  or fruit.  My poor husband argues with the manager a little.  Still a hard no. He tries to call me but i don't pick up.  At this point he is too nice to make any more of a stink about it, so he reluctantly just gets fries. By the time the French fries leave the kitchen, our appetizers and entrees have now been sitting for 15 minutes and everything is cold and soggy when he gets home.   I am obviously displeased and frustrated since French fries were pretty much the last thing i wanted and my dinner is now basically inedible. So we get into an argument, which puts quite a damper on our evening. All because some stupid manager couldn't ask his kitchen to make a couple of side salads to go.   Thanks for nothing Marie Callenders!  (I gave 2 stars for delicious pie and the flavour of the works burger)"}
{"text":"Old place forgotten and revisited. Pot pie was great. Came with a salad and meals come with pie. How can you go wrong when the pie is included in the meal. Hamburger meat was real beef and it did not taste livery it must e sirloin"}
{"text":"The smell of Marie Callender's always whisks me away back into my childhood, when my parents would get off after a long day of work tending a little mall coffee shop and we'd occasionally go to Marie Callender's for some reasonably priced American grub. And that's what Marie Callendar's is. It's not amazing food nor is it an amazing franchise. But it's comfortable, quaint, and affordable. What brought my boyfriend and I to Marie's today is the $8.99 strawberry double cream pie. Oh it was delicious. The pie's usually go for ~$16, and 1 slice is easily $5.50. So $9 for an entire pie is just entirely awesome. We wanted to eat the whole thing. Creamy, just the right amount of sweet, and fresh strawberries. I am always a fan of Marie Callender pies. From the apple pies my mom would buy when I was in elementary school to the college pi days where my RA would get an assortment of pies to now when I go and get my own pies out of pure gluttony ... I have had Marie Callender pies for a long time, and will keep doing so."}
{"text":"Great service, huge menu, happy hour appetizers, and kids eat free on Tuesdays and Saturdays!  We went on a Tuesday as a group of 7 adults, 1 kid, and 2 babies. The server was very attentive and didn't miss a beat- she even reminded us at the end that the kids get pie with their meals! Everyone in our group left full and happy, and excited to come back again soon.  I was most impressed with the service and prices. Quality food and a variety of items that didn't cost us a fortune. The location is great too- right in the heart of the galleria/sunset intersection for shopping and entertainment.   We are locals and we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I am confused on what to give this restaurant.  My husband and I both enjoyed our meals - not loved but liked but the service was bad.  They didn't refill drinks or check in on us.  I sat there and waited for some time for the bill then again to pay.  The pies were marvellous!"}
{"text":"I travel to Henderson for work, and when I have the time I love to have a meal here -- the food is good, there are healthy options, and there are some very delicious unhealthy options, too.  I like their dinner size salads when I'm thinking \"healthy options\" -- they are very cooperative about preparing things as requested.  And there is nothing quite like their pot roast for \"comfort food.\"  And that pie.  Oh my goodness.  Let's not talk about that marvelous pie.  Like I said, healthy and other options.  Slow food.  Good food.  And Pie."}
{"text":"Ordered French apple pie yesterday around 4:30pm enjoyed a slice but after 24hrs it looks and taste nasty had to throw it away, just disappointed that I couldn't enjoy another slice tonight :("}
{"text":"Never been here for the restaurant, but after reading the below reviews, I don't think I want to come.  I do come here for pies quite often. Especially when they have the $6.99 pie deal. Any celebration my family has calls for a pie, so we have had many from here.   Super easy to order and very quick because they have their own register for the bakery. They usually have your pie and rarely run out! My fave is the lemon creamcheese.. yummmm..   Another good thing: Return your pie tins and gets 80 cents off your pie. They really add up!"}
{"text":"Late dinner with family. We were originally going to Olive Garden but the wait was approximately 45-1 hr which was way too long for me since I haven't eaten for 14-15hrs. My sister & I ordered double shrimp pasta which was $16.99 a plate. It was a good portion, sauce was delish, & pasta was cooked just how I like. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ supreme bacon burger which was $10.99. The kids got the usual grilled cheese & Mac & cheese. Which kids eat free on Tuesdays & Saturdays."}
{"text":"Pies Pies Pies are the ONLY reason I come here. I stopped dining at the infamous MC quite some time ago after a bad meal experience.  Their desserts are the only saving grace because the food is overpriced for salty and skimpy meal portions.   The Decatur street location closed, so now I drive over to the remaining Sahara location to pick up pies for special occasions. Their food has gone downhill, way downhill to the point of no return. I miss the MC of the 1980's and early 90's when they had delicious food."}
{"text":"Years ago, I did eat at a Marie Callender's somewhere in California. From what I remember, the food was good. But then again, that was a pretty long time ago.  We got invited to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house and I thought it would be a good idea to bring over some pies. Not the cheap grocery store kind. I wanted ones that were reputable and delicious. I called the restaurant in the beginning of November and asked how their ordering process works. The employee told me that because they sell so many pies during Thanksgiving, they don't do pre-orders. However, they would have a tent set up in the parking lot with a lot of their pies available to purchase, so all I would have to do is come on down.  Luckily, the day before Thanksgiving, I got out from work early, so I drove straight here. The parking lot was packed and the line was pretty long! But, it wasn't as bad as it looked. The employees did a good job at keeping the line moving. I think because they only had 2 registers and had to either fix or replace the register tape often, that was the reason why the lines didn't move any faster. Plus there were some customers who were like \"What?? These are THAT expensive? On second thought, I'll just buy one.\" Ummm hello....read the signs people!! You had all that time waiting in line to look at their prices and to decide!! I picked up Pumpkin and Chocolate Satin (this one is made with a Oreo crust.   Listening to other people's conversations, pre-orders can be done online. They had a separate tent for pre-orders of pies and feasts, with a short line. Good to know for next year! The pies were tasty. The Chocolate Satin pie was kind of rich, but everyone enjoyed both. I may come back and to buy more pies for Christmas this year!"}
{"text":"Usually I LOVE MC but today was NOT one of those tumes. Shepherds pie has too hot to eat..way too hot..the Caesar salad was filled with brown lettuce,  the dressing was sour and my pumpkin pie was burnt and tough. My server was nice but inattentive.  I was SO looking forward to eating here but spent way too much money on..well basically apathetic foid and service.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"Blueberry cream pie yummy my all time favorite and it reminds me of my mom, since she use to buy it for us for the holiday's. Go when they have their special's , I believe that they have their pie sale twice a year.  Happy yelping   xoxox  Terri"}
