{"text":"Talk about amazing food This is the must go place for fine-dining in woodbridge, I had the daily special of saffron risotto with ossobucco and was truly one of the best meals I have had in a very long time, And my kids loved all their pizzas!
If you are in woodbridge this place you must go to!"}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic! It's a great place for a party too (I had one with 20+ people) and Maurizio and his staff were fantastic! I will definitely be coming back here for dinner."}
{"text":"The food is really good! Loved the pizzas because it was thin and just tasted real! I would say all the food that my table ordered tasted good, but the service was not the best. Portions were nice and big in my opinion and prices were approximately $15- 30. The staff were all really friendly and welcoming but they seemed a bit disorganized.

 My pizza had been sitting out a while before we all got our food, and I know this because my pizza was just warm and not hot with cheese all melted like my friends pizza. I asked for it to be reheated and they did that. One of my friends didn't receive her pasta and the rest of us were almost done our food, so she asked for it to be cancelled. They actually packed the food and said that it was on the house, which was nice of them. 

When it came to the bill, my friends and i split the bill according to what we ordered. Tip was also included so we split it among ourselves. I included my tip and paid cash, but when my change came back the waiter said they were short a toonie and sorry. Meaning, I paid more than the tip they included. I wasn't upset, but i don't think i should be forced to have to pay more especially when service wasn't good. In a situation like that, I would think that they would give more change back rather than give less change back to a customer. 

Overall, good food but not good service. I'd definitely go again, but I'll be prepared to expect \"not the best\" service."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. The fried calamari was good , but the main course was very bad. We were a group of 12-13 people and no one was happy with their food."}
{"text":"Dined at this place twice, and each time, the server, an older man with a mustache was hoovering over us the entire meal. He came to out table, I kid you not, like 30 times throughout the entire dining experience (which was an hour long). He kept picking up crumbs, moving chairs, changing plates, asking questions....I don't know if he was trying to be friendly or whether he had nothing else to do with his time. Both times the restaurant was nearly empty. The second time we came there was another table and they left earlier then us. The waiter kept \"hurrying\" us out, by offering to bring us bill and gathering up our plates. When we noticed that he was hurrying us out, we asked if they are closing, and he said that they are closing at 3, and at that time it was 2:50pm. We just wanted to enjoy our coffees and desserts but his behaviour really turned us off. The food was decent but not authentic Italian."}
{"text":"Summary: great food, great ambiance, reasonably priced, service a bit slow but wait staff are good. 

Loved their mushroom risotto! Would go back for that dish again. Very generous portion size and you can see they took the time to make it right. Lots of wild mushrooms, very aromatic and buttery. Pizza's pretty good, too. Thin, crispy. Middle got a bit soggy and toppings were a bit sparse but overall I was happy. I wouldn't order the steak again, though. It's OK but if you want steak, go to a restaurant that specializes in steak. This wasn't their specialty. Plus, we asked for medium rare and it came out very rare (meat still very purple and bloody inside) but my husband was too nice to send it back. 

Ordered an old fashioned and a gin and tonic. Not a great old fashioned. I was disappointed they charged me $12 for a gin and tonic (wasn't on their drinks menu but available upon request) when most of their mixed drinks were priced between $8-10. 

Overall a good experience. Good place for couples and larger families (eg table for 10-15 can be accommodated). Located inside a plaza so easy to find parking."}
{"text":"Good service, great food considering the area! 
The gnocchi tastes very fresh! Many thin crust pizza options! 
You'll definitely find something you can eat on the menu, no matter your dietary restrictions! 
Very reasonably priced for big portions!!
I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Passed this restaurant many times. First visit and what more can I say but fantastically delicious!! My crew and I had the ribeye steak, the mushroom risotto and the calabrese pizza.  The food was prompt, hot and served together. The waiter David was super friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was classy, welcoming, comfortable and relaxed. Overall one of the best meals we've had in the Vaughan area."}
{"text":"The food was really good! The night we visited they had a live singer and he was amazing!! We started with the meatball app and then I had the pizza and my girlfriend had a pasta dish. We both really enjoyed our food. The only down fall was that the service was a little slow, we waited a while to even get a greeting at the door. There could have been 1 or 2 more servers working to make the Saturday night rush go easier. Overall great spot!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  Never got dissatisfied over 10 years.  This is THE place I go whenever I stay close to O'hare.  First of all, I love the atmosphere.  It makes me feel like I came to Italy!  They have many varieties of pasta with different sauces and ingredients.  Kids menu are great too.  Service is always friendly.  Big portion sizes but you have to eat desserts too, as they are so good.  Tiramisu is my favorite!  I would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"One of my friends heard from a stranger that this place was amazing. They were not wrong. I came here based on the recommendation that this restaurant would give me authentic Italian food.

So to start off, I was worried that this place would be packed when I arrived. I was planning to come in for Tuesday lunch. I arrived with a friend 30 minutes after the restaurant opened, and there was only one other table of 2 inside. Great, no wait or noise. 

Upon coming in, we were immediately greeted by our server, an older gentleman. I wish I got his name. He was so friendly throughout the time we were there. If I recall correctly, you have the option of charging your phone. I did not use whatever service they were offering regarding that, but there was a signage on my table indicating that they offered it. Anyway! It was my first time there and I ordered Arugula salad and one of the pizzas. My friend was a vegetarian, so she asked our server for help, and he himself having been vegetarian, was extremely helpful in helping her choose which pizza would be best suited for her. He went away with our orders and prompty came back with bread. 

The food itself was top notch. I was very impressed with the right amount of crunchiness and the balance between the Arugula salad and pear (sometimes I would have this dish elsewhere and it would be way too salty). We didn't finish our meal, so we had it bagged. When we left about an hour and a half later, there was either one or two parties that occupied several tables. I think it was at least 15 people, so there was still plenty of room to enjoy a late lunch. 

The total for the both of us was a bit over $55 after taxes. It was worth the experience though. I'll definitely be coming back."}
