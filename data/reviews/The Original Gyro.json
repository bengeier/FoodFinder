{"text":"If I were a prisoner on death row, Original Gyro would be my last meal.  The reason I would be on death row is for absolutely murking a criminal amount of gyros from this place.  If it weren't likely to make other guests uncomfortable, I would lay beneath the spinning ring of gyro and have them cut the meat directly into my mouth."}
{"text":"Best gyro and fries in the South Hills! The price is incredible for the portion size and the fresh potato fries. This place is a gem in Castle Shannon."}
{"text":"I've found my go to Gyro joint!! As a longtime, (now former Tom's Diner) gyro eater, I appreciate the simple, and satisfying experience of Original Gyro. My daughter, is usually my eating out side kick, and if we're in the Castle Shannon area, it's rare to pass up a stop for her plain (meat & sauce) gyro. We've been in enough times, that our orders are in progress when we walk in. I've thought of trying something different, but why mess with the streak?  The Gyro special is the big hit , for $5.75+tax, you get a gyro, fresh cut fries, and an ice tea. This is my kind of 'fast food', not dried slabs of bark like gyro meat that turned me off from gyros at other places. Walk up to the counter, watch your pita warm up on the grill, watch the moist, tasty meat fall onto the pita, and catch yourself drooling as the order is bagged up, (because I take it to go).   If you know what you're looking for, it's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Not the best I've had but definitely not the worst. Plus, the cashier made a mistake taking our order and the owner (I assume) rectified the situation in a great way, so a+ customer service."}
{"text":"My dad loves the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves I think). I loved the gyro, best I ever had.  Although I haven't tried everywhere around Pittsburgh.  Gyro and fries with cheese was 8 something.  The fries weren't the greatest, but salt, pepper, and cheese made them good.  My dad said the grease looked dirty but Idk.  Little family business that needs support."}
{"text":"Always passed this place and wondered how the food would taste because I'm picky with my gyro's. Finally stopped tonight staff is super friendly very welcoming, The pricing for stuff is very reasonable. And the gyro was super soft and the sauce is the best I've ever tasted. Will definitely be going back again"}
{"text":"The gyro Special is a great deal ! Huge gyro fries And a tea for like $6 . The only place I go for gyros"}
{"text":"Have driven past this place many times. Decided to stop. OMG you get a gyro, drink and fry for $7.47. No need to get extra meat, they load it up. Food is made fresh and hot. They also have other Greek items to choose from. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid gyros. I like how they give you big thick chunks of meat instead thin slices. The best part though is their baklava. I love baklava but some places make it too dry, not here. It was really rich, sweet, and tasty. I would go back just for it. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat this is a good stop."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Pittsburgh?    If your looking for the best gyro in the greater Pittsburgh area this just might be it.  I don't live in Pittsburgh but I have been to 2 other local gyro spots (mike & Tonys, lesvos) and I have to say the Original Gyro edges both of them out.    When it comes to gyros there are 2 main criteria: taste of the meat and the tzatziki sauce.  Their lamb is cooked and spiced to perfection on a spitter and the amount of meat they give you is overwhelming, I honestly had to take some out so I could fit it in my mouth.  The flavor of the lamb was sealed in my fingernails for a good 3 hours even after I washed my hands, a true sign of slowly seasoned meat.  Their tzatziki sauce is nice and not too overpowering, like a cucumber cool whip, definitely no feta which I do not care for in my gyros.  I had to take off some point off for the cash only policy even though their prices are pretty reasonable ($5.50 for gyro only, $6.29 gyro, fries, drink).  Also the lack of menu items is a lil disappointing, would love to see some spit roasted pork or chicken souvlaki like they have in Greece or some homemade moussaka.    But if your a Gyro Junky like myself you have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Listen. This isn't the NBA dunk contest. I don't just give perfect scores, but this place deserves a perfect score. The gyros taste is guaranteed to be the best you've ever had. The price is even better! The Super Gyro Special includes a Gyro, Fresh cut fries, and a drink for only $7.47   If you find a better deal on a better quality Gyro, you tell me."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Very quick service, delicious gyros, and reasonable prices. I definitely see myself coming here often now that I live only a few minutes away.   The menu is quite typical for a Greek food restaurant. We ordered two gyros and an order of fries. The gyro tasted very fresh and I feel the meat wasn't overly salty. The fries were fresh cut and were delicious. My only complaint was they didn't give us very much! Oh well, that's better for my waistline anyway.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not my absolute favorite gyros around but good because they are super close to home and I've had nothing but good experiences. Once, the cashier messed up our order and the owner made it right and sent us home with 2 more free gyos! Made us fans for life."}
{"text":"This small gyro store is a great asset in the neighborhood for a quick, filling and delicious meal at a very reasonable price.   They have a number of different combo specials that include a gyro sandwich, fries and a drink. The regular gyro combo is $7.47, which comes to $7.99 with tax. The drinks are not fountain style but instead you pick a can or bottle from a fridge. They have sodas, iced teas and bottled water.   I got the regular gyro and it was a big serving and very tasty. The fries are home made and fresh. This was a great value.   They have some dinner platters also at good prices and some Greek specialty items behind the counter. I'd definitely come here again.   Although there's a few tables inside where you can eat if you like, this is more of a take out place. Service was very quick and friendly. A nice place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the new one in Oakland.I walked home last night from work and got two of the best gyros we ever had..love it..thanks for coming to my neighborhood and only 6 minute walk from my house...great price for 2 Gyros with extra meat and fries and a Drink."}
{"text":"Really great place to stop and get a quick and delicious gyro meal. Everything is always very fresh when I come here and made per order.  They have a meal deal that is a great price which includes the gyro, fries, and a canned soda. Can't beat it! I personally usually get the gyro salad. It's packed full of gyro meat, fresh olives, feta cheese, and other toppings. The regular gyro is always packed full and can be customized for your liking.  Service is fast and friendly! It's never a bad choice to stop here if your in the mood for a gyro or Greek food."}
{"text":"Steak Gyro was awesome! Only complaint were about the fries, which weren't fully cooked. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best gyros around. The meat is very juicy and never hard or dried out. Plenty of food with the gyro special. Our office is right down the street and we eat here often. The employees are always really nice which makes us come back even more!!"}
{"text":"This food is delicious! I love that they shave the gyro meat fresh. Groupons are available- great opportunity to try the place if you haven't already done so."}
{"text":"Wow! Don't judge a book by it's cover! Although Original Gyro looks like a hole in the wall that would serve poor quality cheap food, I assure you it is quite the opposite. Per hubby's request, we stopped at the OG on our way home the other night for some quick take out.  For $8 each we got a meal with our choice of protein, pita and two sides. I chose the chicken with fries and a salad while hubs got the pork kabob (forget the official name) with rice and a salad. We watched as the cook cut the potatoes and cook my fries on the spot! Delic! My only criticism is that they were is desperate need of salt. The salad was huge with large chunks of cucumbers, tomatoes, olives and feta. The vinegarette was tasty but a bit sweet for my liking. My chicken was spot on. So much so that my husband quickly gobbled down my leftovers before I could save them for tomorrow's lunch. All in all, good food, great quality and huge portions. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"These gyros are hard to beat.  Good meal value excellent taste.  Quick service.  If you are looking for a gyro in the Pittsburgh area, check these guys out.  I have been to a lot of gyro places and this one has done it right.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Update:  too many times we have come in here, and the owner of this business is extremely rude  his employees horribly in front of customers. I just don't want to continue patronizing this man's business, and while the Gyros are good if you go in there you'll see what I mean"}
{"text":"Best gyros  i have had. Great meat. Quick , nice and polite service every time here. Good place and reasonable prices for the delicious food"}
{"text":"A good gyro, but not great.  Definitely not on the level of Mike & Tony's, Sparta, or Knossos.    The meat was ok, but did not have a lot of flavor and seemed to be dry and overcooked.  The tzatziki sauce was a little too thick, but had a good taste to it.  In terms of the amount of meat you get, it is very little compared to their places.  Also, the fries needed salted and were not very good for being fresh cut.  The people inside are always very nice and friendly.  Service is usually pretty quick as well."}
{"text":"Very good gyros and wow you can't really beat the price. Gyro, fries and a tea 6.70 that to be is a deal!!! We be going here quite often."}
{"text":"Always fast service and reasonable prices. I usually either get the gyro special which comes with fries and a drink or a gyro salad. The portions are huge I just wish their fries were cooked more.   I'm so glad they take cards now. Although it never stopped me from going before."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick and tasty gyro at a great price that can't be beat. There is limited seating available but take out is quickly and easy. The gyros are flavorful and packed with meat and all the right toppings so much that you better not be afraid for things to get a little messy! I didn't try any but some sides and desserts are available. Service was quick and we were out in less than 10 min with our piping hot food. You can't beat the prices. While the workers were friendly with us, they were having an argument amongst themselves right in front of us which was unprofessional but I will still be back for takeout because you can't beat the product for the price!"}
{"text":"Was there today with a friend.   The gyro was good and the service was fine.  Very friendly waitress.   However, the jerk of a cook, (Sam) wouldn't stop yelling and pushing around our server.   She couldn't do anything right.   Both my friend and I were angry.   It made for an awkward lunch.   We will NOT be going there again.   I hope that poor woman isn't his wife.   He should be ashamed of his behavior."}
{"text":"They now have a better menu with specials and coupons, and option to pay by credit card before was cash only."}
{"text":"The OG is still CASH ONLY!  After visiting my aunt and uncle in a nursing home way, way out in South Fayette last evening, Dad decided to treat us on the way back.   The dolmades are still divine, and the fries are twice-cooked, hot fat glory, but that gyro, which I had been itching to sample was a worthy challenger if not the very best I've ever eaten. The pita bread was fresh, plush, and studded with cornmeal, the meat was fall-apart luscious, but the ace in the shirt pocket was the tzatziki sauce which recalled ranch dressing with its union of lardy, tangy, and sweet.   And the baklava was yet again nutty, flaky, honey-drenched pleasure."}
{"text":"I was in and out before I could check in with Yelp.  The gyros were nicely sized and tasted great.  Prices were fair as well.  I'll be back again for more.  :)"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. I like the gyro very much, wasn't too salty and the sauce was great. Only problem we had was that the owner I believe was berating his kitchen help the entire time we were there. It made it uncomfortable and that usually takes a lot for me to see before I feel weird. Hopefully it was a fluke but will give it another try."}
{"text":"This is a good little spot for gyros. I order a regular gyro with fries and tea. The gyro is always fresh, packed with meat and toppings, and served quickly. The tzatziki is pretty good, though Olympos Gyros in Robinson still wins me over for best tzatziki. The baklava is really good as well. It's cash only but there's an ATM inside. Staff is always kind of standoffish but nice enough, not rude in any way. It's a good spot for a quick meal."}
