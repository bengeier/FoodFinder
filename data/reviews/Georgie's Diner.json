{"text":"Great food and service. Varied menu offers something for everyone. They will accommodate your menu tweaks and do it with a smile. These folks are anxious to please."}
{"text":"New restaurant in town former desert daves. Stopped  by for lunch food was fresh,very savory,would like to return for diner and breakfast,looks like a large selection for breakfast.also would like to mention the excellent service."}
{"text":"Solid portion sizes and prices. Greek dressing is delicious. Soup and Cobb salad were great put perhaps please cut the tomatoes in to smaller pieces instead of having large wedges, same with the meat and cheese. :) Lots of room in there and clean."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance because Fountain Hills needs something that isn't Italian or Mexican.  However, while I think the food is fine you can't keep running out of items only a month or two in and expect people to keep coming back.  I've been there three times and all three times they did not have the same product."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be good and to be fair I've had several people tell me how good it is. We've only been this one time and they are new....But we went for a late breakfast last week and it wasn't that great. We had a party of 4 and 3 of our orders came out a with a problem or two. I don't want to waste time naming everything that went wrong. But we were missing items and then served items that weren't correct based on our order.

I wasn't rude and mentioned to the waitress about not liking one of my items...she told me, well it's popular and I explained why I didn't like it. She said so where are you from? I said NJ and she said well that's probably why...it's not a popular item there. 

I was like...where are you from and she told me (Midwest) okay, I said, i can tell you this item is not a popular item there either...additionally I said...

I know what I'm talking about I have a culinary degree, I've been in food biz, traveled extensively throughout the US and have family from the South where this item is most popular. 

All I can say is, I never said it's in-eatable it's just not that great. She said okay walked away. I did try it but left most of it uneaten and she never offered to take it off the bill and I went ahead and paid for it because I didn't want to be a jerk. 

Now to be fair when we walked in we were greeted well and friendly by the guy at the bar and it's a convenient location. 

Even after all I said I would give it a try for lunch or dinner. Maybe they are still working out the kinks as a new place."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. We like that breakfast is served all day and it's good. The Greek food is not that good, I'd go to Munich Gyros instead. Good service."}
{"text":"New restaurant in town, we went for the fish fry which was enjoyable. The server was quite friendly and attentive which made the long wait for food easier to handle. The decor of the restaurant was rather depressing. It was obvious that the owner opened up over the previous restaurant's decor. Paint is old and the desert scene mural from the old owner still surrounds many of the tables. So much for a \"diner\" motif. Although the fish fry was tasty, the ambience takes away from the food. Not certain if we will go back."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We had a great breakfast this morning. Eggs were poached perfectly. Ground beef patty was outstanding. Fast and friendly service. We will be back. Fountain Hills has needed a place like this for a long time."}
{"text":"We had late lunch here today and got great service from a young gentlemen named Mitch. Because we were feeling like comfort food and heard great things about the restaurant we were anxious to try this place as we are desperate for a regular place to dine and unfortunately had more than our share of mediocre food in our neighborhood.

After a long convo with Mitch who shared his faves on the menu, we started with a salad that came with Greek dressing and the lemon chicken rice soup. Salad had two slices of tomato, a few slices of cucumber and Greek dressing on the side. Didn't really care for the salad as the dressing was more thousand island lite but without taste. I was more in the mood for and expecting a vinaigrette dressing with red onion and feta. As far as the soup, it sounded interesting and we were game to try new things so we ordered it. Suggestions for improvement would be to bump up the rice a tad, take back the lemon taste a bit, control the filmy oily taste that was floating on top and I would of liked to see more then one very small chunk of chicken in the soup.

For an appetizer we ordered the Shrimp Saganaki. It was a hot dish served on a skillet. The shrimp came out hot and was drenched in marinara, feta cheese, onions and came with a little portion of pita bread on the side. I liked the taste of the fresh tomatoes and the size of the shrimp was decent but again, we tried it and felt it was greasy.

For the main dishes we ordered spaghetti and the meatloaf with mash potatoes and veggies. Both orders were generous in portion but we only ended up enjoying one dish and that was the spaghetti. The noodles were hot and al dente, the sauce just the right balance to the meat sauce and the marinara had a nice subtle sweet taste. This dish I would go back for.

As far as the meatloaf, it came out cold, when I forked one tiny slice it felt rough and a bit hard and when I finally took one bite of it I decided just to send it back because if you're following my reviews food served cold and without taste is one of my pet peeves. 

For dessert, Mitch gave us not one but 2 slices of baklava which was served hot with a drizzle of syrupy sauce. It was quite nice.

As far as parking is concerned be prepared to have to find a spot. We parked on the side of the road as one side of the street is designated 30 minute parking and we aren't the kind of diners that can eat in 30 minutes.

All in all, the servers are friendly, the place is clean and note that the restaurant is in soft launch and that they are giving the community 20% off this month. It's a good way for us to taste a few things from the menu and at the same time work out the kinks."}
{"text":"The new place in town.  We've been here twice and both times has been good (so far).  Both of our visits were for dinner and drinks.  There was some live music that was enjoyable too (not so loud that we couldn't still enjoy conversations).  You have to keep in mind that I'm not the biggest Greek food person (my wife loves it), so I may not be a good reviewer. But I'm excited to have a new sit down diner with a nice menu and a great bar."}
{"text":"So glad this diner opened up in FH!  They have a very wide selection of food, good home cooking, never a long wait to get in."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this new restaurant even though most of the Fountain Hill restaurants have been disappointments.  I was also encouraged by other reviewer's comments.  Unfortunately, my first visit may be my last.

We had a delightful waitress who did everything she could to make our visit pleasant, but she had no control over the failure of management to ensure the food was properly made and served.  My wife and I ordered salads.  My salad and dressing came out room temperature.  I sent it back and asked for coleslaw which was one of the options on the menu.  They had none in the restaurant.  My wife ordered a Greek salad which took 25 minutes to get to the table.  It was also room temperature.  We were told the cooler was not working.  

Management needs to pay attention to the quality and delivery of food.  They don't get a second chance."}
{"text":"We love it.  Never had a bad meal there, service is fabulous and athe food is wonderful.  Great assortment, very authentic.  They now have Tommy Holloway sing on Friday nights which is a huge bonus.  Had seeing negative reviews this early in the game.  Highly recommend, we need this wonderful restaurant to be successful.  It's an amazing diner experience!!!"}
{"text":"There's a new diner in town and the locals are happy!  Georgie's is comfort food with a Greek twist. Down home American favorites such as Philly cheesesteaks, and burgers, American style breakfasts including eggs bacon sausage pancakes hash browns you name it, and Greek favorites such as gyros, grape leaves, lamb, and kabobs!  

Was able to go on their first day of business and can see the Managment and staff have already got the place in tune. 

Had the Philly cheesesteak and can say that it was not only gigantic and reasonably priced, but also tasted fresh and delicious!  Decided to try the Shrimp Saganaki on a whim and was not disappointed. Again, much more food than I was expecting!  

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable to boot!  

Will be back soon!  Our group may have found a new breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch hoping it would be a good experience, but no. I ordered a tuna salad sandwich but first asked the waitress id there was celery, onion or anything mixed into it and she said yes.  It took way too long for it to come out and I wondered are they making it from scratch? It came with a side of soup or salad so I ordered the lemon rice soup. It came after the sandwich and was terrible - had a fake taste of lemon like a strong lemon scented detergent and too salty. The sandwich was a disappointment - just tuna mixed with mayonnaise and that's all, no celery or sweet pickles or onion - tasted like they just opened the can of tuna and plopped it into a bowl with the mayo.  Fishy tasting. I could have done that! I asked the waitress about it and she just shrugged her shoulders and said sorry.  She did offer to get me a coke to go but no thanks I just wanted a decent meal."}
{"text":"Sunday morning and my wife and I decide to give this new restaurant a try. Quickly seated, however, waited 10 minutes for our waiter to take an order for coffee.  While waiting for the coffee I noticed that the restaurant was nearly full but only two tables had food.  There was a lot of confusion amongst the staff with regards to responsibilities, how to answer the phone, where the coffee was, etc.  5 minutes after asking for coffee it arrived luke warm, and waiter explain that several staff members didn't show up for work and that the owner was out grocery shopping.  Decided to quit while we were ahead, paid for the coffee, and left. So I'm unable to comment on the food since nothing was coming out of the kitchen. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"As full time residents of Fountain Hills who are all too familiar with the array of mediocre, overpriced and unsatisfying dining choices in town, we were excited about the prospect of a new restaurant coming to town.
We were a little disappointed to see another diner concept as Phil's is only a few blocks away and already has the market cornered on unnecessarily extensive menu of sub-par \"diner dishes\", however as soon as we read that Georgie's had Saganaki on the menu - we made a trip there right away. 

The ambiance inside of Georgie's was very confusing as it still has the decor and wall murals from the previous establishment, an ill-fated Southwest themed Steakhouse so it definitely doesn't feel like a diner. We opted to sit at the bar where the Bartender immediately greeted us, took our drink orders and handed us menu's. We were happy to see that they had Lagunitis IPA on draft and ordered a couple of pints while perusing the menu. The menu is just as disjointed as the decor - it's hard to tell if it's a breakfast joint or if they specialize in American, Italian or Greek. We decided on Saganaki to start, followed by the Greek Salad and entree portion of Spanakopita served with rice and vegetables and a cup of Chicken Lemon Rice Soup. 

The food all came out very quickly...almost too quickly... 
The Saganaki and Greek Salad were both enjoyable, however it's not too difficult to master a skillet of flaming cheese or a salad. The entree of spanakopita was another story - you could tell it had come straight out of the microwave as it was heated unevenly and the normally flaky phyllo dough crust was soggy and chewy. The rice was bland and the vegetables were obviously frozen, flavorless and colorless. The cup of Chicken Lemon Rice Soup was passable but not enough to make up for the rest of the order. 

While the food was not great, it was also not to the point where I felt the need to complain to the staff/management as we did eat most of our meal and it was after 8pm in Fountain Hills so our options were already pretty slim and we really do like to try to support local businesses. I would not, however recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a satisfying meal - If I'm craving a Greek Salad or Dolmades, I'll continue to go to Fountain Hills Express Deli or Munich Gyro where I can count on receiving a well prepared and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Visiting a new restaurant in town. They just opened today and it was a great start! Real Corned Beef With eggs and Greek Omelette! Amazing! Service was outstanding!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very good addition to town service is professional so far the food we had  is very good,layout is very well thought out."}
{"text":"Every Thursday and Friday night they have live entertainment. It's toe tapping fun. There is a huge selection of food... something for everyone. It's not gourmet but home style cooking.  Their home made chicken and dumplings soup was very tasty. Next time I'm going to try the Gyros since it is Greek owned.  The prices are more than fair so I would highly recommend Georgie's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  As a Chicago native, I am spoiled by great gyros joints in my home city, and Georgie's rivals the best of them!  Their gyros meat, right off the spit, is absolutely delicious. They have some great options on the menu, and if you are a fan of breakfast for dinner, you can find it here. There potato pancakes are packed with flavor. The service is great, and the owner is talented and very friendly.  In just a short time, this has become my favorite restaurant in Fountain Hills. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is nice and friendly.  They serve a different varieties of food. I ordered spaghetti and it was tasty plus they give a big portion so I had some the next day.  I usually don't like left over spaghetti,  but I must say there's was just as good the next day. I'll be going back for sure. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"This is my second review of Georgie's. This one is for their breakfast.  It was great and the prices were very reasonable.  The place should have been packed but sadly was not.   My husband had the eggs Benedict skillet and he loved it. I had French Toast with sausage links and one egg over medium.  The egg was cooked perfectly and the French toast was fluffy and flavorful.  Really good breakfast.  Now that we have eaten here twice I think I would definitely recommend this restaurant.   The service for breakfast was very good but I cannot remember our servers name. She was blond and a bit older than the other servers but very professional and the food came out quickly and hot!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices and all kinds of choices on the menu. Went here on a recommendation and was really happy. I go here about once a week now with my wife. The food is incredible for the few dishes Ive had before finding my \"usual\". The place is inexpensive as well. Go here and you will not be disappointed! Hard to get good food photos since the lighting is dim and cozy."}
{"text":"We went their for breakfast and it was delicious. I ordered the cornbeef omelet and my husband ordered the Belgium waffle. The portions are large and the food was fresh. What we both liked was the range of choices on their menu. The diner is modern, pretty and very clean. 

The service was great. The staff are friendly and attentative. We look forward to trying going back for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"New place in Fountain Hills. There have been several restaurants in this particular location. I sure hope Georgie's sticks around. Open 7 days a week from breakfast to dinner it has a well rounded menu that includes classic American fare as well as Greek and Italian as well as others. 

I had the fried egg burger with some onion rings. The burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The fried egg wasn't runny but that's okay. I would have made a mess anyway. I used mayo on the bread. The hamburger roll was very fresh. You also get lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle on the side so you can decide if you want all that on top. I didn't so that was perfect but I ate the lettuce, tomato and pickle anyway. Sort of a mini salad. The onion rings were hot and sweet.

Lois had been craving a hot roast beef sandwich. She had the open face one on white bread. The gravy was very rich and the meat was tender and tasty. Also mashed potatoes and veggies too AND a small side salad. Prices are good too. Wait staff are efficient and very pleasant. We want to go back and try the Greek spaghetti sometime!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant when they opened. I had some lemon chicken soup which I had never had before and it was good along with a salad. I went later in the afternoon and it was not a busy time so, I was surprised when I was hardly checked on to see if I would like a drink refill or anything else. I'll try them again because I've heard other good reviews and I would like to try some of their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice little nook restaurant, home style. Good food, but be patient as they are fairly busy and young servers I feel have too many tables to keep up. Out of water, went and asked for refill. Fairly new and growing pains but great place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great Bartender! Had a fun Happy Hour Experience here too! We will definitely go back! Also, the Chicken Caesar Wrap was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and ok food but we won't be back because we just don't like the atmosphere.

Called a diner and food is diner food at a low price but the place is dark and looks like a nightclub.

If we want diner food, we will just go a couple blocks away to Phil's Filling Station. Looks like a diner, has good diner food and friendly service. 

Our little village doesn't really need another diner. What we desperately need is a cool, progressive foodie restaurant that's farm to table and has craft cocktails."}
{"text":"This place would have zero stars if possible. We just attempted to eat here. We were told by hostess that she would set up a table for us. We unloaded the party from the car, proceeded in only to have the staff begin to freak out. The owner even commented that he's sorry but they are short staffed. Not a good sign for a newly opened restaurant. 

On a Saturday night at 6:30, chairs were up on the table as if they were ready to clean the floors and call it a night.    After such a rude welcome, we left hungry."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try being it's in town and something different. We ordered for take out, took about 4 calls to get through to someone. First time I was on hold for over 5 minutes, hung up and called back and lines were busy. Finally the 4th try I got through.
They said they were backed up and it would be like 20 minutes. When I showed up to pick up the order I still had to wait about another 5 minutes or so. We ordered a Denver omelet and a three eggs, sausage, bacon and French toast meal. When we got home part of the order was missing a few things. The eggs were over easy when we asked for scrambled, one meal was supposed to come with French toast and we didn't get any, other meal was supposed to come with toast and we didn't get any.
We asked for no ham on one and to substitute for sausage but they still put ham in. When the order was taken the gentleman on the phone had even repeated the order so not sure what went wrong. The food was good. so we will probably give it another shot.  It's convenient location and different for the neighborhood. Maybe due to the fact it's newly opened it's just a little bit disorganized but will get better in due time."}
{"text":"Another option in Ftn Hills, Georgie's Diner, fresh & excellent, had the  namesake omelette & it was amazing!! My server was Jeremy, a super nice guy, who was great!! I'm thrilled to have such a great place near my house~I will be a regular :)"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been three times now. Went for brunch/lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised. I do feel like they still have to work on the timing of the food from the kitchen, but they did appear a little more organized on the floor than they were my first two visits.
This visit I had an egg sandwich with sausage and cheese. It was ALL SORTS of yummo. The sausage had a LOT of flavor, the egg was cooked just as I asked for it (over easy - so that it oozes all over the other ingredients), and I had it on sour dough bread. It was seriously the bomb.
The hubs had pancakes, eggs, and bacon - the pancakes were good and much bigger than he thought they'd be. He regretted ordering three, instead of two, but managed to eat all three (good hubby!).
The waitress was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed her company. She was the oldest person to wait on us there, which may be why we thought she was better than the two younger gals that we'd had in the passed - or maybe the floor is really that much better organized.

If you're local and you've been holding out because you hate 'new' restaurants and being a guinea pig while they learn, I'd suggest it's okay to go now.
(although, I am looking forward to trying their stuffed grape leaves again and hope that they are better then last time and that they no longer put marinara on the rice served with it)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast and will never go back. The two stars is for the super nice and personable waitress that served us. The food gets no stars. Our food was cold mine looked like slop on a dish (biscuits and gravy) and the biscuits were hard and stale. There are better and cheaper breakfast spots in Fountain Hills. If this diner wants to live they need to step up their food game."}
{"text":"Love this diner - everyone who works here is so nice & the food is really good. They pretty much have everything on the menu from veggie options for breakfast to Italian food for dinner. I have been getting the veggie omelet with chicken and it is so good. My hubby and I come here probably too much now!"}
{"text":"First the good news. I really do love this place and the food is really good. We had Helena as a waitress,  she is totally awesome, she is a keeper! She is the sweetest sweetest person that I have ever met in a restaurant. If you don't mind some Constructive criticism per se, I do have a suggestion for you guys. We noticed When we walked into the restaurant that there is a cigarette bucket right next to the sewer drain, near the front door of the restaurant. It had a bunch of cigarettes in it with nasty nasty black water. There was also a ton of cigarettes thrown on the ground, as well as a ton of cigarets and trash in the sewer drain. That is very very very DISGUSTING and unattractive. And the fact that your employees are throwing trash and cigarettes in the drain is really really disturbing. That's not cool at all. It's a very hideous sight to see when you're walking into a restaurant. If youre gonna let your employees smoke outside, at least make them do it in the back of the restaurant so that customers don't see that. It's really really nasty like I said, the fact that they're throwing it in the drain is not cool at all."}
{"text":"Fountain Hills has been missing a true diner experience.  Not any longer.

The menu is extensive.  It's an all day menu with breakfast, lunch & dinner all on the same two-sides menu.  

Their breakfast menu features all the regular items, but the quality is what makes the difference.  Hash browns made from freshly shredded potatoes?  Yes.  Coddled egg?  Yes.  3 egg omelet? Yes.

Lunch features their wonderful hamburger.  So many sandwiches and the like.  Truly something for everyone.

Salads?  I had the small version of their Greek salad.  It was huge!  It was covered with delicious gyro meat.  This was the best gyro meat I've ever had.  It was a thicker cut than I'm used to.  Very tender, too.  The salad was accompanied by freshly made pita bread.

Their dinner menu features a variety of comfort food like chicken fried steak.  There are also Greek specialties made with traditional recipes.  There are Italian menu items, as well.

Their house soup is Lemon Chicken Rice.  I was offered a sample on a blistering hot day.  I honestly could not imagine putting hot soup into my body.  My waiter encouraged me to try it.  Wow!  It was delicious and almost refreshing.  

Dessert...their baklava is made from an old family recipe.  I usually don't order it, as it's too sweet for my taste.  Again, the waiter suggested I try it.  It was perfect.  One piece was too much for me.  Better to share,

This is a very new restaurant.  It opened on Labor Day 2017.   As with all new businesses it takes time to work out all the systems and, in this case, for the wait staff to memorize that menu.  What's the owners response to the inevitable glitches?  Until October 15(?), they are giving a 20% discount off their already reasonsbly menu.  Smart and innovative.

I must mention that the owners are eager to please.  Customer satisfaction seems their #1 priority.  It's a nice change in our smart phone obsessed society.

This restaurant should do well.  All the elements are there."}
{"text":"YES I am a BIG Fan of Goergie's Diner.  In the month that it has been open, we've been there 5 times.  The Gyro Salad, Chopped Sirloin Steak, Meat Loaf, Salmon and many more dinner entre's are cooked to perfection and nicely presented.  Great American Comfort Food with a Mediterranean Flair.  Several Items are Greek inspired.  Attentive and well trained wait staff. Great Bar and good beer selection.  Prices are very good.. a great value..  so come on out.. have a little live music, be comfortable, bring you friends and have a great meal.  Check out the Breakfast Menu too. I had the Eggs Benedict this morning..  wait, I guess that's my 6th time here in 5 weeks..  that's how much I like the casual,comfortable and unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mon 130pm cup of chicken vegie and noodle soup with crackers was very good.  Had fish n chips which was okay comes with steak fries.  3 pieces of cod."}
{"text":"I like Georgie's Diner a lot! 
Delicious food, clean comfortable, atmosphere... A great variety and nice service..."}
{"text":"We just had a great lunch at Georgie's in Fountain Hills.  The menu is extensive - with American, Greek, and Italian choices.  I had breakfast for lunch and the Veggie Omelet was really good (and only about $8).  My friend had a skillit lunch that looked and tasted great.  We were seated immediately, got drinks right away, and a timely lunch.  We were in and out in less than 45 minutes.

Next time I am going to try the Greek entrees.  You should definitely check this new restaurant out."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Everything is good. Large portions & reasonably priced. Nice to see a restaurant doing well. I recommend this place for any meal, or to meet friends for a drink. We quite often come for happy hour where we have chicken wings, which are really good. The staff is very friendly & very efficient. Overall one of our favorite places to eat."}
