{"text":"The new restaurant just opened. Today, I tried it. Scallop is as big as hands, excellent quality and reasonable price???"}
{"text":"New restaurant that opened a week ago, and had no website or social media so had no idea what to expect when coming in. This was literally, for the yelp.  They've got a nice clean interior, with wooden booth seats for every table. Most of the tables are designed for four people. Definitely lots of leg room, as the tables are a bit small relative to the size of each booth.   Menu comes with quite a variety of the usual options you might see it a generic japanese restaurant, like some ramen, or some donburi, or some sushi or sashimi. Now, what stands out to me is their choice of premium items that they offer wish a few different types of dishes: \"wagyu tonkotsu ramen\", \"lobster platter\", and deluxe sukiyaki experiences with things like wagyu or king crab + lobster, and all sorts of other things.  But I ended up getting a katsu don. One decent-sized piece of deep-fried pork cutlet over a large serving of rice. It'll definitely fill you up if you're a light eater, and I found the taste alright. Tried some of their ramen but the soup reminds me of wonton noodle soup for some reason.  Got a $2 sakura pudding, which was a small chilled gelatin dessert with hints of peach and lychee. It's pretty good on a hot day.  Also, hot tea is free, and the tea is pretty good. They offer a teabag in a nice tea pot. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me.  Overall, I think this place has the ambiance down and the tea is enjoyable. Combine it with some shareable apps and it's a good place to sit down and chat."}
{"text":"You will come here for the ambiance.  That's all I really recommend.   AMBIANCE:   The seating is very spacious with lots of leg room and privacy.  The lighting is dim, which adds another level of intimacy. Decor-wise, I like it because the wooden booths and fake strings of dried fish and acorns attempt to transport you to a bygone era of Japanese culture.  It's also very clean.  My only gripes with the layout is how far the table is from the seat. I had to sit at the very edge of the seat and lean really far forward to eat my food. I'm of average height for a woman, so I'm not sure how kids would be comfortable sitting there to eat with their shorter torsos.   FOOD:   I had the shoyu tonkotsu ramen. The ramen choices are very limited, as the restaurant only serves different variations of tonkotsu ramen.  Portions are massive, which would have been a plus if it wasn't for the fact that the whole dish tasted like it came straight out of the package. The ingredients didn't taste like they were of high quality, and thus it felt like ''food court food''. Although the prices were fair, I would rather get a grab and go meal from somewhere nearby.   I probably won't be coming back, but this is just my take on it, so please keep that in mind"}
{"text":"sashimi is obviously low quality and not fresh. do NOT get the sukiyaki since the \"broth\" is literally tubs of lard... imagine hotpotting your meat and veggies in a pot of boiling oil. my entire digestive tract was covered in grease for hours afterwards. servers are incredibly inexperienced but do attempt to be friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill before your movie starts (Scotia Theatre) with really good service. I really hope the flavors can improve a bit more. My fried rice was kinda plain, but the portion is huge. The price is also pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Checked out this new joint near us today, was pretty disappointed. The food was much too expensive for what we got, and it didn't stand out in any way. I got the beef bowl, and it was more like Korean bulgogi than what I was expecting. I don't know if it was bad per se, but it wasn't what I was looking for. The Angus platter or whatever was actually pretty good, though it was cooked medium done when we asked for medium... The servers are still new, so I shouldn't say anything bad about them, but they were definitely trying and were friendly."}
{"text":"Tried beef bento. Never again. Beef was very low quality garbage, it was not even cooked properly, and the aftertaste  was disgusting.   At least they gave us candy at the end to help with that.   Maki in the box was so badly made, it was probably made by a summer intern.  Hopefully they will go out of business soon and something better opens there.  Even Hosu that was there before had better quality beef."}
{"text":"Awesome bento boxes for a super great price!     I've been here two days in a row now grabbing takeaway boxes to my office nearby.   Yesterday I had the chicken teriyaki bento box, and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was, and the sheer amount of food in the combo.   Today I had the salmon teriyaki and it was perfectly cooked, all for $11! The staff have been very friendly when I've picked up my order, not sure about dine-in service.   Hidden gem that I'll be sure to go back to, and try out the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 STAR  Service: Great service, attentive, nothing to complain  Food: We ordered the Chicken Screwers, Torched Salmon Sushi, Canadian Dream Sushi Roll, and Beef Supreme Donburi.  Chicken Screwers - it came with 4 screwers even though the menu says 3? It was well seasoned, but the portion was very thin and small, a good appetizer if you aren't too hungry.  Torched Salmon Sushi - tasted very good and fresh, not sure if it's worth $8 for 2 pieces?  Canadian Dream Roll - not sure what was Canadian about it, but these rolls were HUGEE. The look of it reminds me of the Korean kimbap, and tasted a bit like California roll with eel. The roll tasted good, but not amazing, and definitely not worth $18?!  Beef Supreme Donburi - the title of this dish is very misleading. The last time I had anything Donburi, it's always been steamed rice topped with cooked protein and other toppings. HOWEVER, this dish came in the form of mixed fried rice? I was a bit confused when this dish came, but the taste was great with a great amount of beef, I actually liked it!    Overall: Food was definitely served fresh and good, can't say anything was amazing. But for the price? For what you can get somewhere else, I'm not sure if the food really matches the price..."}
{"text":"Opened a new one near my work day meal, long weekend rest today come and tried it on, salmon boxes only $11, and brown roasted tea is free, is really worth, just take-out menus will have next Friday"}
