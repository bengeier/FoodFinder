{"text":"Food is tasty but the burger was expensive and small(about the size of a Big Mac). the service was mediocre and they didnt even come to the table to ask how the food was"}
{"text":"Picking up son at case western. Stopped in for a bite to eat. Waitress explained happy hour menu to us. Noticed we were a little early but still honored the prices. Anne was our waitress. She did a great job tending to the table. Wings were fantastic. Three different burgers ordered at the table and all were delicious. The fries were crispy. My only negative is that the music was a little loud."}
{"text":"When I am in town on business this is one of the places that I will take my clients.  The food is good, the service is solid, the menu is diverse."}
{"text":"Sweet waitress very accommodating!! Which by the way it's their motto except the check...three roles of Sushi one side salad and three of glasses of red for $70!!  Fair Sushi good wine selection. Little $$$ for up town students, visitors won't know any better but still decent."}
{"text":"I stinkin' love this place.   Whenever my boyfriend and I are looking for a place to eat that isn't too far from campus but can guarantee death by delicious food coma, then Dynomite is our first choice. First of all, we're always happy with their beer selection- we can find some hoppy beers that he likes and wheat beers that I can enjoy. They offer a wide range of burgers, each providing a different dining experience. When I get the Big Zack burger I feel like I'm chowing down on a burger at a backyard barbecue and when I opt for the L'Albatros, I feel like I'm getting a 5 star meal at a fancy French restaurant. You can't go wrong with a burger at Dynomite!   One disappointment is when I got their Dragon roll. For some reason, it feels wrong for me to receive 6 sushi rolls for $12, when I can get a huge burger with fries for $10. The roll was fresh and delicious but it left me craving for more. I was forced to steal fries off my boyfriend's plate."}
{"text":"Nice concept for lunch. Burger was really tasty for $10 including fries."}
{"text":"Chili Fries!!! Is it my love for fries or my love for chili or the multiplicative effect of the two together that makes me love Dynomite so much? All of the above.  PLUS you can have chili fries on top of an open faced burger!!! The service is fantastic, and the beer list is legit. I'm not sure what more I could ask for! Except that they also have sushi. I'll put that on my to-eat list."}
{"text":"Ordered two simple sushi rolls ($8.50 each) and there were only 6 pieces of very mediocre sushi in each order. Such a disappointing ripoff for sushi."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was mediocre - fries were cold and the burger was well done and dry so not as advertised. Seating is uncomfrotable with tables that are too high and overall noise level is just that  - noise. Background music and TV clash. All of this is very unfortunate as the location is very \"uptown\" but the experience is a C- quality and not at all up to the standards of the Chef Owner, Zack Bruell. I won't go back and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, cooked to perfection!  Tasty sushi roll to get the dinner started.  Great selection of beers.  Add that to a wonderful staff and you get a perfect casual Friday night dinner spot, without spending a fortune.  This one definitely makes it to the list of regular spots to get a good dinner when you want good food in a happy atomosphere."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Happened upon it after a long by enjoyable day at the Rock Hall.  The Philly Rolls were so yummy; nice and fresh. For dinner, I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I also substituted my fries for the mozzarella sticks and the sauce that came with them was to die for.  Overall, this place was extremely unique (burgers and sushi in the same place?!). I loved it and will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Tried the fried mozzerella and was blown away. The french fries and burger were some of the best I've ever had. Really great prices and amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Both the sushi and burgers are great. I wasn't sure how they would be able to deliver having two such opposite kinds of foods, but I think both the sushi and the burgers are some of the best you'll find in Cleveland. I've been her twice, and both times with the kiddos. They are very accommodating and brought out fries and pickles right away for our hungry toddler. The special sushi roll with beet cured salmon, chili fries and housemade veggie burger were some of our favorites last night. Drink selection was good too. Its also great for families/couples who have a meat eater and those who prefer fish/vegetarian. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. We stopped in for a late lunch before going over to the Cleveland Museum of Art. They don't have an extensive menu, but our waitress was knowledgeable and gave us recommendations based on the items we were debating between. We ordered the spicy uptown sushi roll, the rice bowl, and the parallax burger with chili cheese fries.   The rice bowl was a large portion and delicious. However, my only complaint is the addition of cilantro. I found the cilantro to be over powering for the dish. I would recommend the bowl to anyone who enjoys a good deconstructed sushi dish, but I'd be cautious of the addition of cilantro unless you really enjoy cilantro.   The spicy uptown roll was fantastic and we recommend it if you have a taste for sushi or are looking to try it. It came with a standard 8 pieces for $12 which is roughly the same amount of food and price for rolls found in Chicago. All the ingredients were very fresh and light and could be tasted in every single bite. The spicy mayo was not over powering and allowed you to enjoy every piece.   We also recommend the chili cheese fries. The fries were crispy even under all the chili and cheese. The chili was hearty with a lot of flavor. The queso was lighter than a typical nacho cheese sauce. Once again the cilantro was present in this dish when it wasn't really needed.   Starting with the pickles skewered on top of the burger, they were exceptional. Definitely worth the price as a side. One of the biggest regrets, was not asking for more. They were very crunchy and fresh. The burger itself was cooked perfectly (medium) juicy, with thick pieces of bacon, and the rest of the components were in perfect ratio to the burger. A well put together burger.   The only reason we did not give it a full 5 stars was due to the price. Two meals plus an appetizer with no drinks (soda/or alcohol) made for a pricey casual lunch. Definitely recommend it to anyone, but be forewarned it can get pricey."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Super friendly staff. Chummed with the bartenders. Manager on duty kept great convo with me. Had multiple signature burgers and sushi. Food is well prepped and prompt.  Hood selection of beer for those who want an adult beverage."}
{"text":"Wow! Great burgers! We had the Parallax and the Cowell and Hubbard burgers. Both cooked perfectly and delicious! Good beer selection, had the happy hour special ($5) Dortmunder, great suggestion from our waitress. Service was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great Burger. Beef to bun ratio is perfect and price is reasonable. I also had fries and pickles - both good. Great beer selection on tap - pleasantly surprised to see Platform was offered. Zach never disappoints."}
{"text":"We went for a Monday night happy hour at the bar.  This location opened in the last week.  The space is very similar to other Uptown locations.  It's a big, clean space with a bunch of windows and a lot of gray.  There's a decent sized bar on the far wall with a kitchen behind.  I've never been to the original seasonal Dynomite in Playhouse Square but have had a couple burgers at the Progressive Field stand.  They've been well-done but tasty.  This location has a full bar as well as an expanded menu with sushi.  I didn't really get the happy hour. There was a discount on well drinks and wine but I wanted a beer with my burger.  The \"happy hour\" beer was a $4 Sapporo... same price as the menu listed.  The friendly bartender agreed they need to work that out.  I would let that go because of what followed.  We started with an order of $5 buffalo wings.  Three tender complete wings, with flats and drumettes attached, coated in a buttery buffalo sauce- they were delicious and a great value.  The burgers... Awesome...  Each on the menu is a gourmet concoction, most named after other Bruell endeavors. We had a Kafeteria and Cowell and Hubbard.  I ordered mine mid rare and that's how it was delivered.  The beef was top notch but what made them to me was how the ingredients worked together.  The sauces on each were outstanding.  The $8 burgers were a decent size, not enormous but just enough for a meal.  Other sides are a la carte.  This place is going to give that other chef's burger joints a serious run for their money.  A great value and a great meal!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the dynamite for a while since they first open up and I've had a hamburger from there and it was very tasty and I also had a turkey burger I don't how much salt to use in that but it seems like it was a lot but otherwise everything was really good really good the French phrase for excellent big bug got the best french fries around this area the service was good and the manager it was good"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have only had burgers, so I can't speak for the sushi side, but I do like the burgers. I've had the Dynomite and the Kafeteria. Both are tasty flavor explosions and both are likely to become soggy quickly. I think it's probably safe to assume that all of the burgers are likely to quickly sog, which is OK if you're eating quickly! Part of this is because of the sauces and dripping toppings, but another reason is the juiciness of the burger meat.   The beer selection is OK and the bar service is OK. Nothing too crazy.   Overall, I like the place and I'll be back for burgers and maybe some sushi one day.  Tip: Be prepared to get messy if you're eating a burger. Bring moist towelettes, roll up your sleeves, don't expect your lipstick to stay in place."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've had in Cleveland. Service was par for the course. Atmosphere is nice but it's cold inside the building during winter. Grab a burger for sure"}
{"text":"Friend and I went in for Tuesdays special (Chili Cheese Nachos) and burger with beer, and were satisfied with the good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo sandwich - it was pretty good, I appreciated the pickled veggies. Like other yelpers, I have to note that the sandwich was very runny/soggy. You will want to wash your hands before you leave! Fries were very good. Seems like a decent drink selection with beer, wine, and mixed drinks. Wouldn't mind coming back and checking out the other offerings. It wasn't very busy around 8pm on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Fab service from this guy who looked like the monopoly man. I didn't really like the IPA beer he recommended, do he gave me taste of two other beers and replaced my beer. I had the spicy Dynamite burger which was delish.  One less star cause the cheesecake was still frozen and tasted like it had freeze burn. Great service and food otherwise. Great place to hang out and watch the game."}
{"text":"This place is home of the BEST chili cheese fries I have literally ever had in my entire life. So the chili is tasty, the cheese is melty, and the fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (even alone, some of the best fries I've had in awhile). There is a lot of cilantro piled on top of these fries though, so if you are cilantro-adverse, maybe ask for it on the side or something.  The burgers here are good but not the best I've had. I've had the Parallax burger and the Kafeteria burger. Parallax is the only burger with bacon, but the BBQ mayo was only okay and I felt like this burger wasn't too unique. I actually preferred the flavors of the Kafeteria burger, which had kraut on it and I think a slice of salami too. The burger meat and buns were not extraordinary, and I feel like Flip Side actually has better burgers in that regard.   The ambiance here was super fun, and I came here with a large party and there were able to accommodate us well with great service. They even served cake that we brought with us to the birthday boy, which was nice. Overall, I'd be back, I'd like to try some of their drinks next time."}
{"text":"Since it was national cheeseburger day, we decided to try out dynomite burger.  We got seated right away, got our waters and then we got ignored for 20 mins.  We almost walked out until my wife said something to a waiter walking by.  He stated he was not our server but he happily took our order.  They weren't busy but it seemed liked they were under staffed. The manager must of caught wind of it because he stopped by and apologize for the slow service. He even offered my 3 year old son a free milkshake, which I thought was really cool.    Let's get to the important stuff....the food .  The food was great.  I was skeptical about sushi at a burger joint but it was really good. We got the Spicy Uptown Roll, which was a combination of a california roll combined with a tuna roll.  It was fresh and perfect.  We also got the Dynomite burgers, fries and mac & cheese.  The burger was juicy and cook as we asked.  The sides were also spot on.  We will definitely return.  Next time we will go on an off time."}
{"text":"It was ok.   I probably should have ordered a burger.  I ordered a steak and it was just meh.  It wasn't warm enough when I got it and wasn't seasoned well.  I definitely had better.   The side salad was ok.  The servers were nice.   However, I didn't receive a steak knife which I thought would have been basic.   The broccoli was just ok too.   It's a rather bland meal.   I am sure there are better places to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I really like this place because I think its a perfect fit for uptown - on the cheaper side, but good quality burgers, sushi and chili fries. Very nice atmosphere. Sapporo beer on tap is a nice rarity."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. My boyfriend and I were visiting Cleveland and he picked this place. I was a little suspicious with the contrasting burger and sushi theme but I was not let down in the least. I got the Dragon Roll and it was one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had. Very friendly staff and quick service too!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out in UC area.   My partner said the burgers were great.   He lives and dies with turkey burgers which comes  with cranberry sauce.  He loves it.   I got the parallax burger which had bacon cheese red onion and a bbq mayo. It was very good.  Everything is ala cart and fries are extra.  The parallax came with fries and was $8  burgers are reasonably priced   At this time of day and year the place is slow. Hope it picks up when CIA  and Case start back up.    Patronize this place.  It deserves ur business.  One of the best and for me tips my old fav b spot which does not see to be as good as when they first open."}
{"text":"Burgers and sushi, sushi and burgers. That's what they do. I enjoyed the salmon rolls although I wish they had a few lighter sides on the menu to accompany it. On its own 6 rolls wasn't filling enough and there weren't any obvious healthy choices to go with it. I opted for the gazpacho soup in the end then stared in envy at my husbands rather delicious looking vegan burger and fries. I tried hard to resist although I did steal a few when he was looking elsewhere. They tasted pretty good but hard won food always does."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I were looking for a good place to eat nearby and we walked into dynomite. We were pleasantly surprised with menu offering sushi and burgers. The burgers are massive ,delicious and loaded with calories. Over a period of time  I have gone to this multiple times and eaten all the 8 type of burgers they offer and each of the type is mouthwatering. One of the best burger places to go near Case western/Little Italy area. Moving on to sushi's now. A burger place that can churn out wonderful shushi. For the average price of one sushi, the taste is unbelievable. Wasabi sauce is pretty decent and adds on to the sushi along with the soy sauce."}
{"text":"Had an incredible time here two weekends ago for my 21st birthday. The waiters were incredibly patient as some of the guests arrived late/ a few more showed up than what we had originally reserved for. They attended to our needs very quickly, offering us more beverages/ water whenever they noticed that we ran low.   But best of all, my boyfriend brought in an ice cream cake from Mitchell's and they graciously kept it in their kitchen freezer until it was time to be brought out, and lit all the candles before bringing it out. The ceiling fans were on, so some of the candles were blown out before I got a chance to blow them out, so they even turned off all the fans for a bit so that we could relight the candles and take some pictures! They didn't have to do ANY of those things yet did so without asking. Five star service and food. Thank you Dynomite for such an incredible birthday! :)"}
{"text":"A very tasty and messy burger.  My boss and I stopped in for lunch.  The place was medium busy around noon.  Our server was friendly and the food came out fast.  I got the L'Albatros burger (without peppers): Caramelized Onions, Peppers, Swiss Cheese and Béarnaise Mayo including Fries.  And my boss got the Chinato: Mortadella, Mozzarella, Tomato, Balsamic Onions, Tomato Mayo including Fries.  The burgers are delicious and the fries are average.  Each meal was $10."}
{"text":"Very good service, nice patio seating. The veggie patty was house made and delicious. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Food is good - though service is very hit and miss. Either they are totally on their game or expect to wait for refills, paying, etc. staff seems generally nonchalant."}
{"text":"I usually don't review stuff around Cleveland, but I feel like this place deserves one.  Dynomite just opened up in a location that seems to be a death wish; the bar that was here before only lasted a few months, and it's right next to the world's worst Chipotle so of course everyone goes there.  But I really hope this place survives and students start going here.  The music was good, staff were friendly, atmosphere was relaxing, sunny and pleasant.  I had the Cowell&Hubbard with a chicken patty.  It was solid, not the best burger I've ever had but pretty good.  The fries, though, oh my god.  They were some of the best fries I've ever tasted.  Perfectly crispy and fried with a hint of vinegar that gave them tons of flavor.  Everything was reasonably priced.  When I went, it was mostly empty.... Case students!  Start going here!  When I came to Case in 2010 we just had the Jolly Scholar, Rascal House, Qdoba, and what's now the Denny's All-Nighter.  I would have killed for a high-quality place like this when I lived on northside, if I come back and this has closed because everyone just kept going to Chipotle, I will be so disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very good, been there twice and as  a owner of a restaurant, I pointed out a small concern, and the next time I stopped in it was corrected."}
{"text":"Dynomite Burgers & Sushi is a great addition to the Uptown area of Cleveland, near University Circle and Case Western Reserve University.  I've been there two times and I've enjoyed my food both times.  They have a wide selection of burgers and other casual food.  I've had a couple of their burgers and have been pleasantly surprised each time.  The fries are also good.  Service is quick and friendly and there is free parking nearby.  Someplace we will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I am currently at the restaurant waiting for food. I am with a party of 5, and we have been told by staff that our order is taking more than 45 minutes to come out because we have such a large party.   We have spoken to multiple staff members, and even someone who I believe was a manager, and basically were told that they were busy and we just had to deal with it.   If you can't move tickets for 5 people, then maybe the restaurant industry is not for you.    Would not come back, and would not recommend. Honestly don't even care how the food taste, though I will say my expectations are EXTREMELY low at this point."}
{"text":"I love coming to Dynomite Burgers!  It's a very convenient location near the dental school so we walk here after clinic pretty often.  What keeps us coming back, however, is not the close location: it's the burgers!    Each time I have eaten here, I've gotten the Parallax burger.  It's the perfect mix of flavors with cheese, bacon, BBQ mayo, and onion... how could you possibly go wrong??  It' always perfectly cooked and we never have to wait long.  We also generally get cheese fries to split and they are delicious!  The fries are nice and crispy (no floppy fries here!) and the cheese sauce is delish.  The happy hour drink specials are good and the wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  We have never had a bad meal here so we will continue coming back for burgers!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected. Unique food combinations. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We hadn't planned on coming here originally, but because it turned out that Crop was having a private event and was closed, we decided to give it a try. It was a beautiful day out so the building opened the sliding glass walls so there was a lovely breeze through the hole place! It was really nice. I ordered a vanilla milkshake, the happy hour sushi special, and some chili cheese fries. Loved the milkshake, and the sushi was great and unique (had some pico de gallo on top with fresh salmon, wish I could remember the whole description), but I could have had my fries cook a bit more. Some were floppy. Our waiter was also really friendly!   We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"First timers here! Everything was so good! We had the Big Zac and the Parallax with a nice Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and finished with a couple of bowls of their in-house soft served ice cream! Yum. My friend Duane (GM) and our server Cameron are doing a great job here."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday night around 9pm. Place was pretty full. Cool interior with flat screens showing the Cavs game everywhere. The staff was quick, friendly and attentive. I ordered the Parralax burger which came with a side of fries. Both were delicious and reasonably priced for a gourmet burger. The food came out super fast too. Great place, cool location, great staff. Highly recommend. Looking forward to checking out the original stand by Playhouse Sq in the warmer months."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The customer service AND the food was excellent. I must admit I enjoyed the sushi better than I did the burger, but my burger was still good. I had the dragon roll and it was very flavorful! I had the turkey burger with fries, and my husband had the turkey melt with ranch fries. The ranch fries were great. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but overpriced. The burger was really good and the service was fast."}
{"text":"this place is amazing! i love anywhere with good veggie options and make your own styles. this place has both! their veggie patty is delicious. it's not your typical bean burger. it's got some beets in it, giving it a lovely red purple color, and something meal-y like mashed potatoes. i really have no idea though but it's super yummy. also you can put the veggie patty on any of the suggested burgers, or make your own! my burger was awesome. we also had the stuffed peppadew peppers. they were really tasty but we weren't used to the spicy sweet of the peppadew. and last but not least, the cocktails were delicious! they are a few dollars on the expensive side, but still tasty none the less. will have to go back and try more. wish that their happy hour included a few bucks off the cocktails! the only downside, the wait staff seems to be a bit inexperienced. went three times and all three times, sat waiting, and waiting, and waiting. oy! all in all, will be back, since we've already been back a few times :p bring down the drink prices, train your staff better, and keep up the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place just opened so I want to give them the props they deserve. I went for lunch with co-workers and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger. The staff was very attentive to us and seemed to really care about the quality of service. I ordered a burger with bacon and béarnaise mayo. It was very flavorful and juicy. The prices are decent too. My meal was less than $10 and very filling."}
{"text":"I visited here, looking for something different and that is exactly what I find! Whoever combined sushi and burgers deserves a medal!  I went with the Kafeteria Burger which consisted of a burger, sauerkraut, and crispy salami, Swiss cheese topped off with Russian Mayo. This was absolutely delicious! I also got the spicy uptown tuna and salmon roll. If you're looking for something different, check this place out! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Burger and sushi spot near the Case Western campus. Open layout with bar seating and TV's all over the place, has a modern vibe to it. The staff was attentive and super friendly (which is always a plus)!   I can't remember the name of the burger but it was one of the staple burgers that had bacon, cheese and other yumminess! My only gripe about the burger was that it seemed rather small for the price, however, they make up for that with a LOAD of fries! The fries were really good, seasoned well but not too much...also, very crispy (which I prefer).  Chocolate shake: Anytime I go to a burger place I automatically assume shakes will be on the menu (because, duh?)...what I don't like is when the place uses a soft serve ice cream with syrup...I mean, if you're not going to use really ice cream than don't even waste my time and at 6 bucks a pop, no thanks."}
{"text":"Goddammit! Chicken jerky is not what I ordered.   I've been a huge fan of the wings here.  I was hoping to confirm tonight and write a honorific review that their wings were the best in Cleveland...and they were, in Dec and Jan with this fantastic paprika laden buffalo sauce on the whole wing. But geez, they just pulled a fast one on me and it ain't cool.  I just placed an order to take home [0.5 miles away] and the first wing I bit into was basically jerky. The second,  was crunchy.  The third, I just gave up. What I got were wing dings that had been definitely sitting out all day, then tossed in some sauce [see pics]. Shame on me for not checking,  like how mama always told me. Shame on them for serving me this. The 1 star is because I thought these wings were amazing... Otherwise it'd be zero, as in the zero fcks shown to my order.   I am embarrassed about all the Dynomite wing recommendations I have given to friends thus far this year.   #smh #skipit"}
{"text":"Second visit here and probably our last. The service was horrible and the food was just OK. Not up to Bruell standards. Our waiter was friendly and tried hard but he was pretty clearly the only person on the floor who was capable, and he just couldn't do it all. Sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came over, plates weren't cleared, water glasses not filled, never got our second round of drinks. He apologized and explained how busy it was, but the place was only half full, so sorry but that's a management problem Zach. The women's restroom was filthy - at 7:00 pm! Our salads were over-dressed, and the sushi was mediocre. The burger was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best thing to happen to uptown! With a menu that carries burgers and sushi it has a Lil American Asian fusion that will soothe anyone's palate.   I have been to this joint a few times already and never left disappointed! Location has it sitting a perfectly in the hub the swanky new cleveland uptown. The restaurant in itself is huge with clean lines with an upscale sports bar feel.   To me the food is the show stopper here! No matter what I have tried... it's been mmmm so good. I have already had a variety of their burgers (the dynamite burger is my personal fav) and a few varieties of the  sushi rolls. The burgers  have always been cooked to perfection and oh sooo juicy. The fish- fresh and flavorful.   The only downside to this place would be the service... it is a hit or a miss. Especially when you come with a big party. During my last visit we were a group of 15. Our servers seem disgruntled about the fact that we were a large party. Annoyed when we ordered food. Disorganized and totally lost when it came time to pay. I appreciate the fact that they let us get our individual bills and totally understand how easy it can be to mismanage seeing who are what in a large party. Though I feel if the management allows for individualized bills for large parties they should better train their staff to handle it.   Overall: come here for the food... everything else is background noise!"}
{"text":"Great dinner at Zack's new place by the CIA. Burgers were cooked to taste and were super juicy, 2 napkins needed if you have a flavored mayo. wedge salad was awesome, wings great and the fries delicious! Will have a shake next time after hearing the next table rave that it was the best they have had in awhile! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the dynomite burger but I didn't enjoy it very much. The patty wasn't seasoned well enough. The \"spicy\" mayo didn't have much flavor to it. I definitely added a good amount of ketchup and Sriracha  The fries were also ok. A little too salty but nice and crispy exterior. We also ordered the Buffalo wings which I wasn't a fan of. It tasted like boiled chicken doused in vinegarry hot sauce  However, the highlight of the meal was definitely the chocolate milkshake (recommend adding rum to it, although the shot cost more than the milkshake itself -______-).  It was so delicious, not overly sweet, and perfect consistency.  I will return to try some other burger, like the parallax. Outdoor seating is also a pro, especially during these lovely cleveland summer evenings"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 5 for a quick work lunch. We sat outside, they have quite a few tables set up outdoors. We were seated quickly and the hostess explained the menu.   The menu consists of a variety of burgers...you can substitute meat for veggie or turkey burgers, etc. the other half of the menu is sushi. I got two rolls the dragon roll and the spicy uptown roll. I can't say I'd recommend them. The dragon roll was ok, they seem to have accidentally dumped too much \"sauce\" on it and the imitation crab was drowning. The uptown roll had spicy tuna that was powdered with a coating of what tasted like a bbq dry rub...it was strange. The dry rub wasn't in the menu description and I was left wondering if it was a mistake.   They rest of my crew was also underwhelmed with the meal. The one thing that was awesome...the fries. My 2 rolls and water came to about $26.  The others meals were around the same price. We came there for a quick lunch and it took almost 2 hours. The waitress explained that the kitchen was very backed up due to the university students coming back this week. I may give it a second try and order a burger but, I'd never get sushi there again."}
{"text":"Great burgers they were moist and flavorful- the fries are hand cut and super yummy. My hubby and I were able to enjoy a filling dinner for less than $30- which never happens. The manager that was on duty was incredibly nice and our waitress gave us great service. No complaints we will def be back.  Also on the plus side- this is obviously a new restaurant and is a welcome change to many of the darker older restaurants you will find in the Coventry Cleveland/Heights area."}
{"text":"Fun place in University Circle.  They have a variety of burgers named after Zak Bruells restaurants.  I tried the L'Albatross.  You can choose your protein, beef is standard but I got the turkey burger.  The L'Albatross has onions and bernaise sauce.  I had a side of cheese fries.  Everything was delicious but The diet coke I got was really flat.  The bread for the burger buns was good quality.  The cheese fries were the best I've had in awhile. There are plenty tvs here and there were a variety of shows on from Sportcenter to Barefoot Contessa.  Another great addition to University Circle."}
{"text":"The deal of the day is great. I got the sushi with crab, cream cheese, jalapeño, all deep fried, paired with a beer. I was halfway through the meal and asked for my beer. The waitress said she wasn't sure if I still wanted it. Well, she should have asked.  The burgers we're good. I sampled several family members' burgers, so you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"A meal of unparalleled mediocrity. Avoid the sushi. Two stars are only bc wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss- the first time I came with a friend the food and atmosphere were great. The place was packed.   This visit today will will be my last. My fiancé and I came. We ordered the meatball sub special with no mushrooms. I ordered a small side salad with a side of pickled vegetables no scallions. The subs came out with mushrooms so we sent it back. I started eating my salad and got a mouth full of scallions. This made me mad because we were one of four tables in the place and we were the only ones that had ordered- mistakes happen, but really?! The whole order is messed up? I got up to find our server who NEVER asked if we needed any refills or anything and gave him my half eaten salad. He said we'll make you a new one and I said no. When the new subs came out, a guy with dreads who I believe was the manager brought them to the table and just plopped them down. Didn't ask of everything was ok or even apologize for the poor service. Then we had to wait for the bill because all the employees seemed to disappear to the back. I will never come back. There is no excuse for poor service if you're in the service industry."}
{"text":"Good burgers, good sushi, i was hoping t find some crossover but no luck.  A good compromise if you have people that like burgers and people that like sushi rolls, everyone wins."}
{"text":"4.5/5. Just had my first meal at Dynomite. The food, the service and the environment are good, The price was a little high but considering its location I would say it was acceptable. I had rice bowl and seaweed salad today, both were satisfying: the seaweed was fresh and well seasoned, I especially like that they put diced cucumber underneath. The rice bowl was also good. The spicy tuna, crab salad, avocado slices, cilantro and cucumbers balanced well and were very freshening with the not-so-warm rice in a rather hot day. The only problem or concern I have is the hardness/degree of moisture of the rice. If they use the same rice to make the sushi, it will be too hard and dry thus hard to stay together.  I will definitely return for some happy hour sushi and wings. And if the discount stuff can keep its standard, I will become a regular there."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the burgers here, after reading all the reviews...  - Burgers were quite small for the price, maybe slightly larger than the size of dollar menu burgers from McDonald's - Bread was not additive to the taste of the overall burger; my first burger felt like the bread wasn't warmed at all, while the second was slightly improved, but could have been toasted better - Both my boyfriend and I asked for medium-cooked burgers, but the first batch came out pretty well done (My second, after noting the well-done preparation, did improve, but was oily) - Fries were soft. There were inklings of crispiness, but they left much to be desired - Pickles were pickled strangely and a bit too sweet for my taste - Varied quality of the first and second burgers I tried suggests poor quality control and consistency  I will give them credit for the creativity of the burgers available on their menu, but for the price point, when compared to alternative burger joints, Dynomite has a lot of opportunity to improve. Luckily, they have the foundation to do better if they emphasized greater attention to detail during production.  Going to the attentiveness to detail, I was surprised to find that my first bite included some paper wrapping that got stuck to the cheese and added in my burger. Mistakes do certainly happen, and the manager owned up to the error right away (resulting in a second burger and my order on the house), but the error further emphasizes the need for improved quality control.  With increased focus on the execution and preparation of their food, Dynomite has the chance to do better with an already good foundation of options on their menu. Their service is speedy, but there is no point to being speedy if quality is sacrificed."}
{"text":"So admittedly, I have a bias against Zack Bruell restaurants, because I have tried Parallax, Table 45, Chinato and L'Albatros and I really only like the last of the four, and only the seafood dishes.  But this is different from Bruell's other restaurants - this is a bar.  And it seems like Chef Bruell can make pretty darn good burgers.  A lot of these burgers are very similar, but I guess you cannot be very creative with burgers. They are all named after Zack Bruell restaurants.  I tried the L'Albatros burger, which was juicy and had good flavor.  The fries are good too.  Didn't try the sushi.  I wouldn't dare."}
{"text":"You will note the high frequency of mullah beards in the restaurant, this place is part of a hipster (not yuppy) based renaissance of eateries around University Circle/Heights area. The menu features non traditional pairings of high quality ingredients on decently to well crafted burgers made from good meat. I had the Parallax which was the most traditional bacon cheese burger on two separate nights. I would have given the place 4.5 stars based on the first experience which was great but am giving this place 3.5 while rounding up to 4 as the burger wasn't as great on second try. The fries are okay but not as sumptuous as the Belgian style ones fried in duck fat. They become gummy and chewy and cold too fast -a result of serving on metal platters that conducts the heat away too fast on the concrete slab bars.   The tap has no less than 6 ironically named IPA's, and there are another 5-10 bottles of more beard-produced beer. There is wine and passable (high end grocery roll) sushi as well for those not there on massive munchies (it's next to several colleges). There are screens on the wall devoted to live games, one to Cartoon Network, and a last one to extreme monster truck/X sports. They might make their own pickles. Basically refugees from Brooklyn.   The service is cordial but the food and drinks come a little bit slow. I do appreciate the hirsute server giving me a tasting of a special white IPA (aren't they all).   Finally, very kid friendly."}
{"text":"I'll start with the service which was great! Friendly, welcoming, attentive, and accurate. The food was also great. I got the turkey dynomite burger. The turkey was seasoned perfectly and the flavors were delicious. I substituted the black beam soup for the fries and that was a great decision. Not that the fries weren't good, I tried some off hubby's plate and they were good, but the soup was soooo good!  Husband thought it was good too but the meat wasn't as good as some he's had at other places such as Grind Burger."}
{"text":"Found this place after visiting the Natural History Museum.  Good cheap eats with an Uptown vibe.  Burgers with cool names and tasty toppings, such as caramelized onions,  sauerkraut, chili, bacon, sweet pickles and the usual.  We had the Zac burger, an open faced burger on a bed of peppers and onions, topped with chili fries.  Oh, and the $5 sushi special which was ok, yet much better than GE $5 Wednesday sushi.  They also serve a turkey and veggie burger for those watching their beef intake.  However, if your like me and asking where's the beef, when you want go to a burger joint try the cool-named burgers or hot dogs.  Fresh cut fries were tasty, and frankly should be the standard wherever fries are offered.  Anyway they were good, and the mozzarella sticks came with a tomato aioli that was delicious.   Also, this place would make a nice \"happy hour\" hangout or non pretentious first date place, because of the milkshakes, beer, wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"I came here for the sushi and didn't like my experience. The sushi is very Americanized and is very expensive. I would have to spend over $30 to get enough for a decent meal. There are better places for sushi in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First time here- like the ambiance.  The food looked great and everyone with me agreed their dish tasted great! I loved the turkey burger with cranberry sauce.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go as far as saying this place is amazing. It is just a hamburger store in a college town.  The burgers were OK. The chili fries could have been cooked longer and been crispy then allow the chili to make them soggy, not make the chili crispy."}
{"text":"I've had the parallax, big zack, l'albatros, buffalo chicken sandwich, buffalo wings, chili cheese fries and fried mozzarella. Pretty good, hits the spot, met my expectations."}
{"text":"5 stars for the burger 1 star for the sushi   My first thought when I saw the name of the restaurant was what an odd choice of two food selections to be the main highlights for a restaurant.  I'm always hesitant to get sushi at restaurants where sushi seems to be an after-thought added to a menu along with a mosh-posh of other food items.     Good sushi = good fish + good rice.  Our rolls had neither.  The rice was complete mush/bland and did not have that sweet + vinegary sticky Japanese sushi rice.  I got the avocado cucumber roll and their \"special\" sushi roll with grilled shrimp, fried scallions topped with \"nuoc cham\" their sweet and sour chili sauce.  There was no flavor with both rolls! We deconstructed our rolls and just ate the filling.  Bleh!  The Big Zack Burger was definitely the highlight of our meal.  It's an open face burger topped with carmelized onions, fries and chili. The burger was cooked perfectly.  Combining the idea of chili cheese fries with a burger is absolutely terrific.    I think the sushi needs a definite revamp.  The burger is worth while for me to visit again, but I will not be ordering sushi from here."}
{"text":"New location! Opened up last Friday. I had been wanting to go to the 1st location for awhile as I am an avid fan of Zack Bruell, but the hours and location of the downtown location isn't the greatest for me. So I was thrilled to find that he opened a location close to me.   Food: Fiance and I went after I had a hard work day. I ordered the Cowell and Hubbard and he ordered the Parallax burger with a side of fries. Also got two beers on tap: sapporo and cider. Both burgers were delicious but I favor the Parallax burger over the Cowell and Hubbard burger. Total bill came to 35$ pretip. Would give it 5 stars but I think it's a little ridiculous to pay $0.50 for mayo. Would like to go again to try the shakes."}
{"text":"Located at a very convenient place. It was quite loud inside, like a sports bar. I didn't try any sushi there just because I don't think it'd be a good idea to order sushi at a burger place. I had the dynamite burger, it was quite good. I honestly don't think you'd go wrong with any options. Over four star. Probably wouldn't go there again by myself because I'm not a huge burger person and it didn't really strike me with anything special."}
{"text":"My burger was great (Cowell and Hubbard), definitely worth the $8.  The to-go packaging was great, they give you a heavy duty napkin which is appreciated.    The mac n cheese was a definite thumbs down, not exciting, no flavor, and really not much different than what most people make routinely at home.  Will definitely go back for more burgers."}
{"text":"I've only been here two times in the past year and a half, and I live walking distance from this restaurant.  My freshman year of college I was a vegetarian, so that definitely limited my range of foods that I could order. I was in the mood for a heavier dish so I chose the vegan burger, and I wasn't a fan of that. My patty just kept on falling apart, and by the middle of my second bite, I didn't know what kind of mush I was eating. I really didn't want to come back, but I was convinced to go my second time recently this summer. This time I decided on the Dynomite Roll, and my friend had ordered the Dragon Roll, which were both fantastic rolls. I would definitely recommend trying the sushi, and I have also heard that the burgers are very good too.  They have happy hour from 3-7pm Monday-Fridays. Sushi rolls ate $5 and I think they have great deals for wings and drinks as well.  Service and overall mood are good. It's a decent place to go with a couple of girlfriends, or on a casual date with your significant other! I would check it out, just not a favorable choice for a a pure vegetarian (no seafood), or vegan."}
{"text":"You all got slammed tonight. I feel bad for the wait staff.  I'm disappointed, even angry, at the  management. Got here during a dinner rush. Many tables were full. Our four person table took five minutes, drink order took ten, drinks got there fifteen minutes later, apps arrived twenty-five minutes after that and burgers arrived almost forty minutes after he apps. It was pretty rough. Other tables near us had it worse. To their credit the staff intentionally didn't seat new guests despite there being many open tables. I know things happen in the kitchen or in staff that can ruin an evening. I've been a line cook before and usually grant service sector a lot of slack. But this was egregious enough that management should have been discounting food and drinks. All we got was a mediocre meal and a hasty apology. I never even heard from or saw the management apologizing or helping. Serving burgers an hour after they were orders should have been embarrassing enough to warrant free drinks and coupons. I probably won't go back unless I hear good things from others."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times now.   1st Visit: Burger, fries, Happy hour sushi. The burger was great as was the sushi and fries.  2nd Visit: This time not at happy hour. Ordered fried mozzarella and a spicy tuna roll. The fried mozzarella was probably the best I have ever had, clearly made in house and breaded with tempura. However the sushi was just OK this time and small for the cost. I get spicy tuna at Pacific East on Coventry and get twice the amount at half the cost.   Bottom line: Come here for great burgers, however if its sushi you are craving come at happy hour or go someplace else."}
{"text":"Situated in Uptown and is one of the many eateries in walking distance of Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland. No dedicated parking lot, I parked at a meter. Walked in and greeted promptly. Very spacious area with a large outdoor patio.   Loved my server, super attentive and personable. Came for Happy hour which is 4-7 unlike the top of its website that says 3-7pm. For happy hour, you can choose from a few brews and some well drinks. I was interested in the sushi for $5 (sadly it's only one type of roll, which changes daily). I thought it was odd because they had several sushi options. But it was happy hour and I love a deal so I ordered the happy hour sushi which turned out to be a salmon scallion roll. What was served was 5 little chunk (perhaps the diameter of a quarter), laden with cold old rice (seriously some of the rice grains were hard), which sandwiched tiny slivers of fish. Will not run back here.   The name itself is dynomite burger, so I wanted to see how their burgers fared. I got the parallax burger which was a medium rare like I asked. It was super oily and I only ended up eating half of it. Fries were limp and had little flavor."}
