{"text":"Food was great but service was absolutely god awful. I ordered the veggie burger option which came w/ avocados and they didn't even have avocados in it. A bunch of us added in extra toppings and they didn't even add them in. We were one of the only people in there and they couldn't even get one order right. The pricing for everything is really not that smart either and way too expensive for my taste. $2.50 for two little slices of bacon? Give me a break. At least the food was decent or I would've given this 1 star. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First experience at Artbrgr and glad I didn't pay full price for it. Went with a friend with a groupon for 25$ you get each a burger/fries/coleslaw/beverage and drink. The burger was okay. But I have had better I think instead of having to burger patties choose one and make it bigger. I would have been upset to pay 14-18$ for a burger with a thin patty. Now on to the service...where to begin...boy do they suck. They really need to step up there game. Service was so slow. They never checked on our table. Dessert was donuts. They gave us 3 donuts...but we are two...why not 4... It didn't make sense. Then came the bill. They never brought the bill to our table we had to go up to them....once we got the bill there was a discrepancy between caramelized onions and grilled onions...like I didn't care how much it was it based on principle. There was a miscommunication on both myself and the server. But as it's the servers job he should have double checked before placing the order. And then he had the audacity to be like \"if you order a cheesecake and eat it\" I was like no that's completely different. He needs a brush up on his people's skills. After this experience I would never come back. There are so many amazing burgers out there. Just walk up to Mange Moi on Mount Royal and you will have the best burger and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"The hummus is the best I have ever had! It is amazing. The food is really good, but the service is so slow. It took forever for our food to come and when we wanted to order dessert, no waitress was to be found. We gave up after 30 minutes, paid, and walked down the street to get ice cream."}
{"text":"Not really the best place to go if you're English. There were many confusions with our order due to the language barrier.  The menu offered many interesting burger options. Burger cook times are very different and they don't think to bring them all out at the same time. I had my burger 5 minutes before my boyfriend recieved his.  The food was good but nothing too special. Even when we ordered medium-rare burgers, the burgers were well done and the meat was tasteless. The toppings however were the selling point. I had a burger with pesto which was a nice touch.  Prices are a little high as burgers come with only one spoonful of \"salad\". Price ranges from about 13-25$ a burger. Fries with burger are an additional 6$!  Drinks are a bit pricey but it's St.Denis so what do you expect.  The place was very nice with simple decor and a sweet little pool table in one corner (which didn't really fit in with the vibe but was still a nice touch). Went on a Friday night and it was practically empty. Terrasse which sat about five tables however was full.  I was annoyed to find out that I had to pay at the bar not at the table.  If I was invited to come to this place again I would probably go however this isn't a \"must try\" on my list of Montreal restaurants or even on my list of Montreal burger restaurants. I probably wouldn't attend out of choice in the future."}
{"text":"This is a great place for having a burger or just a few pints on the patio.  The hummus plate appetizer is a must have, one of the owners was there when we arrived and he prepared it using one of his mother's recipes from back in Israel (thank you Alon!) and we thoroughly enjoyed our beautifully crafted burgers in absolute silence (there's not time nor need to talk when you're enjoying food that much).  There were some chewing/slurping/swallowing/miscellaneous other noises but NO TALKING!!  The staff were very nice as well, Max was a true gent and so were the girls who's names I didn't get.  There's free pool too so rack em up!"}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try for Burger Week because their burger description seemed the most scrumptious.  From the lukewarm welcome and the fact that we got seated at a table where the sun was starting to heat up things too much, we were a bit skeptical.  But by the time the orders were taken, the service was very friendly.  And their \"WTF Burger\" made special for Burger Week was monstrous and amazing.  High quality beef patty stuffed with penne Mac and cheese, resting on a bed of lettuce, fresh tomatoes, sautéed mushrooms, home made chips, covered with cheddar cheese, bacon and their secret special mango and southern comfort BBQ sauce.  It was a challenge to eat though, we had to ask for extra napkins. In all honesty, to date, the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ils ne répondent pas le téléphone et lorsqu'on arrive en personne, ils répondent qu'on doit faire une réservation  par téléphone. ... okaiii ... :/ the fuck"}
{"text":"Good rich meal. 12-20$ per dish.   Very large portions of good quality hummus, warm fluffy pita bread.   Coleslaw- two types come with different things. Meh I would say. Missable.   Good fries.   Burgers nice. very large, not too dry.  Some of the burgers+fries are like $17 so not cheap. Good quality, very rich and heavy.  Vegetarian friendly definitely. Kid friendly too I would imagine at the right times of day.   Slacker service on weeknight but nice vibe overall."}
{"text":"Went to this place as a last meal before my last visit to Montreal, surely was not disappointed!   My best friend, a vegetarian, was in for a pleasant surprise when the waitress told her any of the patties could be subbed with a vegetarian option! (Aubergine please!)   The burgers were supreme! (Although a touch pricey...) The brioche they were served on, amazing! The fries actually tasted like real French fries, not McDonalds! (an Achilles heel of many great burger places)   Cocktails were nice as well, a good cold sex on the beach in the middle of Montreal winter is not too bad!   My favorite part definitely had to be the ambiance! VERY tastefully designed from the white walls to the pop art paintings of celebrities and the high-top wooden tables!   We spoke to the owner, a man who is CLEARLY passionate about his burgers!   Will definitely be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around and decided to have an early dinner. There were just a few people there but then it was packed by the time we left.  I had the Miri Segal vegetarian burger and it was great. The bun was perfect as well as the avocado.   I loved the breaded eggplant. We also had the nachos but only because they were out of hummus.  I recommend this place for a quick yummy dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour manger ou simplement prendre un verre. Les burgers sont évidemment délicieux mais il faut absolument essayer l'humus!! Staff hyper sympathique et proprio sur place la plupart du temps! Ce resto est ma découverte de l'été!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our hamburgers and they were wrong. The hamburger delivered to the table next to us... also wrong. Sure they made up for it, but what if there had been an allergy? The kitchen is just a mess.   The hamburger looks wonderful, they try to make it look like art, but unfortunately this makes it extremely frustrating to eat, bigger than your mouth and then falls apart. The patty was dry and split while eating ending up in a pile on the plate. The cheese curds for the poutine weren't fresh enough to squeak.  The restaurant is very loud. Service was good, too bad the back of the house isn't. Might be fine if they fix the back of the house and start concentrating on the food instead of the presentation. And I certainly didn't go out for dinner expecting to be frustrated by the whole thing."}
{"text":"ART: brgr, like most contemporary art, seems overpriced.  The burgers are indeed interesting and aesthetically put together, but for 20 friggin' bucks, this cow better come in a gilded frame, and these don't. The cocktail I had (a vodka number) was intelligent, but alas, overpriced. And contrary to a few of these reviewers whose stomachs must be the size of my chihuahua's, the portions are not that big (not a bad thing for us fat asses, but don't invest in this place with any delusions). It'll be one of the best unique burgers you've had all year, but be willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!  I rarely ever type those words, but ART:brgr deserves it!  I visited on a very snowy Saturday lunch.  At first we were the only ones in the whole resto, but it quickly filled up as we ate.  I understand why now, it's a totally delicious spot!  I had a melt, which is basically a gigantic sandwich, cooked on a grill like a grilled cheese.  The one I had was filled with deliciousness: hard boiled egg, coleslaw, tomato, breaded eggplant . . . and on and on.  It came with a side of fries and spicy coleslaw.  My only regret is being so overwhelmed with it's deliciousness I ate the whole thing instead of asking to take half home.  I spent the rest of the day in a full belly induced haze.  It was totally worth it though!  Although I found the prices fair, they were a bit more than I would want to pay on a regular basis, so while I won't be running back as soon as I'd like to, there will definitely be future visits!"}
{"text":"As much as I liked our meal, I sadly won't be back, due to the lackluster, indifferent service. It took a waiter about 15 minutes to even acknowledge our presence, and then nearly an hour to get our burgers, with no apologies offered.  It's a shame, as the restaurant has a nice ambiance and concept.  However, customer service is tantamount and in this area, ART:brgr fell completely short."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie poutine from here and was very happy with what i received.  It had grilled mushrooms which were an excellent addition.  Very flavorful and the grilled mushrooms added an additional layer of flavor."}
{"text":"Sunday evening kinda quite but I can see the potential for a laid back hipster crowd here. The food was decent. We had the Rojas burger which everyone else seems to have ordered. It was very good. The meat was juicy and well seasoned. We also got the chicken schnitzel burger which was a little too layered that ended up being a little too messy. The chicken was also a little cold. I ended up changing my Poutine Because the friendly waitress claimed that if \"the humus is not the best you've had in your life\" that it would be for free. Seemed like a challenge to me and I assumed the chef was middle eastern to attempt such a claim. I was ABSOLUTELY disappointed. The humus didn't even taste as good as the stuff I buy from costco or metro.   All in all experience was good and I was impressed with the waitress remaining cool with me changing my mind a few times. I would come again for the sandwich melts but definitely not for the humus."}
{"text":"Went back there yesterday. Service was faster than before, BUT the meat in our burgers was still red in the center.  If their new policy is to serve medium-cooked meat (some people like it), they should make it explicit on the menu or when the waiter/waitress takes orders, because undercooked ground beef can cause diseases.  About 5-10 minutes into our meal: no courtesy check yet. Had to wave the waitress to ask that the beef be cooked some more. She was very nice about it and apologized. Meat still had pink spots when I got it back but I worked around it. Overall burger was still good, fries still OK; I really wished they served green salad instead of coleslaw as a side."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, great ambiance, free pool!  What else can you ask for?  You can choose from their list of burgers or fashion your own.  Lots of choice of ingredients to put on your burger like eggplant or avocado, and tons of sauces to choose from.  Price: about $11-20 for a burger.  They also have many hummus dishes which could be shared appetizers or small meals for about $10.  Also has a bar."}
{"text":"Eggplant burger, pale ale and got a complimentary shot! It's a comfortable and casual spot with outdoor and indoor seating. Pleasant server and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Location: Plateau-ish area, near Laurier metro. Street parking available but pay attention to the signs.  The place: It's small, decor is minimal, and there's a pool table that in't very strategically positioned in the middle of the place. I'm still trying to figure that one out since if you happen to be sat right behind said pool table, you risk having your back or arse poked with a stick. Anyway. The theme here, is 80s-90s, which I can tolerate in small doses but not so much for an entire evening. The wait staff (at least the gals) are outfitted in retro 80s gear and the music being played is genre, Londonbeat, Madonna, Micheal Jackson etc.   The food: I went for Burger week. Will I go back? Nope. I orderd the veggie burger, also known as the Humus burger; while the bun itself was actually quite good, the patty was just this brown lump that, at first glance, didn't look very appetizing. Was it good? It was OK but I've had better Falafel-style patties elsewhere. Half my burger was missing the bottom so I basically ate that half with a knife and fork while I ate the other as a burger should be eaten: with my bare hands. The burger was topped with lettuce, tomato, exactly two sweet potato chips, and was accompanied by coleslaw. No fries included. As far as burgers go, it was dull. The coleslaw was spicy and just not good. Spicy coleslaw just doesn't work for me. My date ordered a meat burger that she said was burnt, and the accompanying fries were cold.   Service: The service was fine, but the waitress didn't explain the two different burgers that were on offer for Burger week (we told her that's why we were there). It was also incredibly slow to actually get our food - maybe that's why the fries were cold. On the up side, we weren't pressed to leave when were done.   Price point: $11 for the veggie burger. Personally, if you're going to give me a mediocre burger and not include fries, $11 is overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Montreal. Definitely #1 in terms of burger taste with creative yet delicious ingredients. Also loove the fries. Yes, the service is a bit slow, but there are so many things in the restaurant to entertain you while you wait: very original artworks for sale on the walls and a pool table. It's a bit pricey which is why I don't go there as often as I would, but sometimes there are coupons that you can find online, which come with a glass of wine, which is pretty neat. Perfect place for a date."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoyed my burger (my boyfriend and I shared the 'Steve Mcgarrett' and 'Le Madame Biron') I was shocked at how greasy the food is at Art Brgr - don't get me wrong, the burgers tasted great, but the food was far too heavy and we felt absolutely sick from the grease!   We ordered a side of fries, to share, but they were quite soggy/cold and dripping in oil (shocking, I know). Unfortunately, I don't think I would go back here. I had high hopes for our experience but the ambience ended up being a little lacklustre and I would rather something a little more heart healthy next time."}
{"text":"Went here because of Montreal burger week to try their special burger for the occasion. It was a beef patty topped with avocado, a fried egg, jalapeños, portobello mushroom etc. with great fries and a salad as sides.  Such an amazing burger! Hard to eat because it's HUGE, but worth the battle. Also the first place in Montreal that served a good bloody Caesar WITH olives and celery(All the other places so far don't, I mean not even the celery, seriously, celery is needed people)!  Worth the trip, and will be going here often."}
{"text":"Très très bons hamburgers tous aussi succulents les uns que les autres. Service impeccable et chaleureux ."}
{"text":"Service: Decent, but a little slow. They did give us a free drink for waiting, so that was nice.  Food: The Angus beef burgers are excellent. Juicy, flavorful, awesome; my only complaint is that they were hard to take a bite of because they were so big. The coleslaw that comes with it was pretty bland - I wasn't too impressed. And the sweet potato fries were not great though my date liked them. I. The rating is high because of the burger - seriously, so good. We had the deep fried Mars bar, and it was OK. I'm not a huge fan of candy bars or chocolate, but my date enjoyed it.  Atmosphere: OK. I didn't like their tables with the high chairs - they were wobbly and unstable. There were also a lot of kids there when we went which made it a little chaotic. Not their fault but this didn't help. It was a cool ambiance, just a few annoyances here and there.  Pricing: A little overpriced. The burgers are superb, but they are profiting at your expense. If you don't mind paying a little more, it's worth the experience at least once."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I bought a coupon for a \"festin\" (aka, EAT YOUR HEART OUT) off a website and decided to finally cash it in..  ART:brgr is located beside Laurier Metro station, this joint is located just off St.Denis and can be somewhat easy to miss with its tiny sign. The \"festin\" consisted of a classic burger, poutine a drink (alcoholic or not) as well as desert. I had to reserve a full 24 hours in advance and did so in the afternoon as I was visiting with my whole family as well as my 5 month old daughter. The resto has a nice ambiance and style that was warm and inviting.  Firstly, the service was really good, probably because of our time arrangement (2 PM). Our hostess was very polite and friendly to our little baby girl and special arrangements was taken care of. The food came quickly enough and she constantly checked on us to make sure if everything was well. Kudos to this.  I ordered a simple classic burger with some bacon and extra cheese because after all, why live to 80, right? The burger was good but not excellent as I wasn't asked HOW I wanted my burger and got well done (even crispy) and I like mine medium rare. Perhaps I should have went with one of the many other special burger options. Nonetheless, I was satisfied.  The poutine was delicious and probably the best experience I've eaten here during this visit.  The side coleslaw was might tasty as well but far too spicy for my taste sadly.  The desert consisted of a fried mars bar as well as some ice cream. I barely had room for this, I needed to be barreled out of the side door.  All in all, a nice place to eat. Not sure if I'd come back though."}
{"text":"Brought in a bottle of apple-cider vinegar  last fall to encourage Alon (Alan?) to include with the regular condiments.  How come fries joints don't offer apple-cider vinegar? Right?! (=D MTL does tend to mao, more than to vinegar in general, I observe, guess its a French / English or an East / West side of the Continental Divide -hostile winter- thing??) =D didn't have fries with my burger this time, didn't see Alon there, and didn't ask about the status of that bottle.  I tend to favour the Marco Polo but had the Gym Du Plateau this time with sweet potato chips. Enjoyed it equally well.   ART burgers are unique and flavourful. And I like the general vibe of this place. Am always treated very well here.   Last time I was out on the patio, (last fall) Alon brought out a plate of Coriander Balls to try. So good. This time (still too chilly for the patio) my server brought me an after dinner pretty-pink-with-a-sweet-little-kick shot to the table. Lovely way to finish up!  Last summer after 9PM the menu had a nice 5$ selection of sliders and sides. Wonder if that's still the case?  =D still strangely struck by my seasonal migrations in MTL. Feels so good to be on the bike, with more the wider range I am accustomed to in year-long mild Vancouver.  Hello SPRING!!! All of Montreal is my oyster again!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger, fun and interesting choices, great music, service and prices. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Shared the sautéed mushroom and hummus appetizer. Not bad. Different concept. Cute presentation but the service...... So slow. A cool place to chill at and have a beer though."}
{"text":"The buns they use for their burgers are the best part about the meal. light fluffy and slightly sweet - yum!   Their menu is long and they have some great combinations of burger. Yay for having multiple types of vegetarian burgers that's been a first for me! I enjoyed my burger but it wasn't anything particularly special. I got a fries on the side which were really a disappointment as they were cold, oily and slightly bitter.   They have a selection of hummus plates I want to go back as it was a big part of their menu and maybe the best thing they have to offer.   If you do go keep in mind that this isn't really an intimate or date spot. There is a large billiards table and the restaurant itself is quite bare. I think they're going for more of a casual dining / bar feel with the place. It works well!"}
{"text":"Original and eclectic burgers, yummy coleslaw (with a mediterranean zing).  Pricey for burgers & melts in my opinion.  $50 for two with drinks & tip."}
{"text":"Ok j'avais eu des bons échos sur les burgers!  bref un midi nous y allons avec mes parents , leur parlant des bons échos.  Nous arrivons , la salle est vide, mince , la mes parents ont le doute. Un restaurant vide signifie t-il que la cuisine est mauvaise? On s'installe, le serveur nous apportela carte, qui a l'air appétissante . Je prend le Fat boy burger avec macaroni and cheese , mes parents celui avec la poutine.  Bon ok on a attendu au moins 20 min avant d'etre servi mais quand les assiettes arrivent , nous oublions l'attente.  OMG , les burgers etaient so delicious, bien gros ,les frites croustillantes  !   bref mes parents ressortent plus que rassasiés et tres contents de leur burgers ! OUF merci ART brgr !"}
{"text":"Great service! Both the waiter and waitress were attentive and helpful. The Zambini burger and poutine were delicious! The margarita aux fraises was also delicious and they gave me extra. Love the ambiance and would definitely come back.   Cash and debit card only. No credit cards."}
{"text":"You know when you leave a burger place and you feel full, but not in a \"I-can't-believe-I-kept-eating-that\" kind of way? That's the feeling you get when you finally muster up the strength and desire to leave ART:brgr.   This build-a-burger style restaurant grills up some of the most succulent, mouth-watering patties in the city, and then gives you the chance to add whatever toppings your heart desires.   Not a fan of DIY ordering? They've got a list of signature burgers that will make your head spin. Add to that the crispiest fries and a side of insanely good coleslaw with every meal, and it's enough to make you wish that licking your plate in public was socially acceptable."}
{"text":"Spacious, well lit, comfortable (although avoid the banquettes), and great music on the sound system.  Very friendly service, young (allophone) proprietors on site.  Superb build-your-own burger, cooked just right. The regular vegetable toppings are delicious, just add one more for flavor.  Delicious sweet potato fries, and deep green salad with vinaigrette.  Excellent smoothie, sweet but not cloying.  Excellent presentation too,  for those who care about that. Very satisfying all around.  $Burger and drink for about CDN $15.00 pre tax and tip."}
{"text":"FERMÉ  Je m'en voudrais presque de partager cette excellente adresse, tant j'ai adoré l'endroit. J'aimerais presque la garder pour moi, mais bon, en tant que Yelpeuse, je me dois de partager les bons plans (et bons plats !)  Je viens d'emménager dans le quartier, et je suis passée maintes fois devant. La charte graphique et la déco m'ont plu au premier coup d'oeil : épuré, contemporain, un brin industriel. Puis la carte : des BURGERS ! Ahah, comment ne pas dire non ?  Alors nous voilà parti un doux jeudi soir ensoleillé en terrasse de cette nouvelle trouvaille.... d'où nous sommes partis comblés et rassasiés.   J'ai pris un délicieux burger avec du bleu, et ses figues caramélisées dans du vin rouge appelé le Belle Ezra Burger - que je recommande mille fois - Un délice. Un pécher de gourmandise. Un mélange de saveurs incroyable ! Puis lorsqu'on me propose un nouveau style de frites, je suis en extase. Si en plus, il s'agit de frites de patates douces, je succombe ! Monsieur a pris le Steve McGarrett, avec de l'ananas, et il a été plus que comblé également.  Pour conclure : service irréprochable et rapide malgré le monde. Personnel souriant et chaleureux.  Alors vraiment, cet endroit mérite toutes ces étoiles, et plus encore."}
{"text":"Ok burger with horrible fries, nothing worse than limp greasy fries. Service absolutely non-exsistent and they weren't even busy, 3 tables. We had to ask for menus, more beer, napkins, the check and even for them to come take our credit card. Oh and mustard, they charge extra for dijon. Yeah you only can have French's with your $18+ burger, a real joke."}
{"text":"ART:brgr is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the Plateau. Not only are the burgers monstrous in size, but the tender patties and creative toppings are enough to have you drooling well after your meal.  For me, however, it's the hummus that takes center-stage. Coming from an Israeli family, I've always been skeptical of any hummus made outside of Israel. The owner makes the hummus himself in small batches and doesn't share the secret recipe with any of his chefs. After years of living off chickpeas, I can confidently say that you don't know good hummus until you've tried ART:brgr (provided you haven't visited the holy land) The decor is modern and very appropriate for the size and shape of the location. The pool table is an extra touch of class and invites you to come just once more to play a round with the boys. I know I will."}
{"text":"Sur le quartier du Plateau, un endroit parfait pour une envie irrésistible de burgers pas sains du tout :D  On y est allés un mardi soir, et comme dans les descriptions précédentes, c'était loin d'être plein, donc on avait toute la place que l'on voulait, et sans attendre, gros plus. Art:brgr propose une carte de burgers tous plus décadent les uns que les autres, avec double steaks, maxi fromage, viande fumée, des recettes sucrées salées originales avec de la figue.  Oui, j'ai trouvé que les recettes étaient originales dans l'ensemble avec un vrai effort de recettes. Je ne me souviens plus des burgers précis que nous avons pris, mais ils étaient bons et réconfortants comme on aime. Les frites présentées en cornet facturées à part étaient très bonnes également.  Pas goûté les desserts car clairement plus de place, mais je pense que nos amis vivant à Montréal reviendront corriger ça :)  Le service était très sympa, souriant, patient et attentif, parfait ! Au moment de régler attention ils ne prennent pas de carte de crédit.  Si on revient traîner nos guêtres dans le coin, ce sera avec plaisir que nous retournons chez Art:brgr."}
{"text":"This place is well of the beaten path for most tourists however is worth the trip I was a bit intimidated to try this place out especially since it was in a predominantly French speaking section of town.   The menu was entirely in French but the staff was more than happy the help explain the burger designs (thank goodness). After an explanation on the menu, I decided on the Rojas burger and fries.  It took a while for the food to come out but hey great art takes time right?   The plate came out and man did the burger look like a work of art.   The bun was a nice fluffy buttery top with a nice inner toast. The veggies were crisp and fresh. My only complaint was that the egg was a little too runny and ended up masking any of the spiciness. Other than that it was a very good.   For those who are very picky on meat temp/color, I try to post cross section pics so you can judge for yourself. As you can see, this one was a nice medium.    The burgers are skillfully crafted works of food art that any foodie or burger monster can appreciate. With that the prices are a bit on the posh side so be warned if you are a cheapo or on a budget. Eat here with confidence!   One last note: apparently the hummus dishes are outstanding. I didn't get the chance to try them because like any other red-blooded American; I'd choose a slab of dead cow over a bowl of smashed chickpeas anyday..."}
